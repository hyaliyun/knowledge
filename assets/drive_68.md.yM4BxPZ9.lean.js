It has been argued that the philosopher Thomas Hobbes may have participated in the entertainment as a performer. Background When King Charles I conducted a royal progress through northern England to Scotland in the spring and summer of 1633, he stayed and was entertained at the country houses of important aristocrats. The most lavish, and in retrospect the most famous of those 1633 shows, was Jonson's at Welbeck. Charles was so pleased with it that he requested another from the same source on his 1634 progress, which resulted in the \\"more spectacular\\" show, Love's Welcome at Bolsover.Henry Ten Eyck Perry, The First Duchess of Newcastle and her Husband as Figures in Literary History, Boston, Ginn and Co., 1918; pp. 92-3. Newcastle spent between ¬£4000 and ¬£5000 on the masque, which was considered a phenomenal sum for such an occasion -- until the following year, when the bill for the Bolsover show exceeded that by ¬£10,000.Julie Sanders, \\"Jonson's Caroline Coteries,\\" In: Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson: New Directions in Biography, Takashi Kozuka and J. R. Mulryne, eds., London, Ashgate, 2006; p. 285. The commission for the masque came at a welcome time in Jonson's career. After Chloridia in February 1631, Jonson no longer received commissions for masques from the Stuart Court; in his long battle of egos with Inigo Jones, Jones had finally won and Jonson had lost. In September of the same year, Jonson had also lost his post as the chronologer of the city of London. The Duke of Newcastle, who had an established relationship with Jonson, stepped in to support the poet laureate in his time of need.Perry, pp. 86-8, 90-1. The show The show opened with a scene portraying the Passions, Love and Doubt, and the Affections, \\"Joy, Delight, &c.;,\\" who sing with a chorus in support. After dinner, the show resumed with a dialogue between Accidence, a schoolmaster, and Fitz-Ale, a herald. The dialogue was followed by six hooded figures who give a display at the quintain, comparable to a display of jousting or \\"barriers.\\" (Regarding the latter, see: The Speeches at Prince Henry's Barriers.) The quintain display was brought to a conclusion by a \\"Gentleman\\" who reproved the rustics and their sport, and hailed the King for his love, goodness, and other virtues. This ambivalent text has been read as reflecting a larger ambivalence in the Court's position on relevant issues. Charles had re-published the Book of Sports and Jacobean proclamations urging noblemen to maintain and uphold traditional country life. Yet the Stuart Court was itself oriented far more to an urban and palatial style that tended to draw the aristocracy away from the country and toward the attractions of London.Leah Sinanoglou Marcus, The Politics of Mirth: Jonson, Herrick, Milton, Marvell, and the Defense of Old Holiday Pastimes, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986; pp. 128-9. Texts The text of the masque was published in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641, and was thereafter included in his canon. A manuscript of the masque is extant among the Newcastle papers, as is the letter from Jonson that probably accompanied the delivery of the text. Hobbes In 1998, A. P. MartinichA. P. Martinich, \\"Thomas Hobbes in Ben Jonson's The King's Entertainment at Welbeck,\\" Notes and Queries Vol. 45 No. 3 (Sept. 1998), p. 370. argued that the figure of Fitz-Ale in the entertainment may have been filled by Thomas Hobbes. Martinich based his argument on details from Hobbes's published works and his known relationship with Newcastle, who patronized Hobbes as he did a range of other writers.Perry, pp. 122-6, 128-32, and ff. (The idea of a philosopher turning actor may be strange to a modern sensibility. But training in rhetoric was a fundamental aspect of the trivium, the basic educational system of the day; participation in a rhetorical exercise like the Accidence/Fitz-Ale debate is comprehensible in light of that tradition.)

He is regarded by many as a major figure of post-war Belgian comics. Early life Maurice Tillieux was born in Huy in 1921. At first he studied for the merchant navy, but his career prospects were sunk following the German invasion of Belgium in 1940. He claims that while waiting at Bordeaux for a ship that was to take him and his fellow students to South America, a Stuka dive-bomber attacked another ship, forcing Tillieux's to turn round and Tillieux to go home.Comment on devient dessinateur (How to Become a Cartoonist), article written by Maurice Tillieux, published in Spirou magazine issue 1615 (March 1969) and in an omnibus edition of Gil Jourdan He turned to writing and his first novel Le navire qui tue ses capitaines (The Ship that Kills its Captains) was published in 1943. Many of his stories would be set at sea or in the docks where his early ambitions may have developed. Two other novels are supposed to have been written at this time, but there seems to be some confusion as to whether or not they were actually published.Dictionnaire mondial de la Bd (World Dictionary of Comics) by Patrick Gaumer and Claude Moliterni, , Tillieux had already done some work as an artist. He contributed to various weekly and monthly comics as artist and writer, often signing his work with a variety of English pseudonyms. Career It was in the weekly comic Hero√Øc-Albums, which started in 1947, that he developed his style and proved himself a master of detective stories loaded with humour and atmosphere. Hero√Øc-Albums's main appeal was that each issue contained complete stories rather than a number of episodes spread over weekly or monthly instalments. Tillieux's most notable contribution was F√©lix, the adventures of a glasses-wearing reporter who travelled the world accompanied by two sidekicks called Allume-Gaz (French for gas lighter) and Inspector Cabarez of the Chilean police. Like most comic strip reporters, F√©lix spent most of his time fighting crooks and spies rather than simply reporting about them. Street scene from Gil Jourdan's first adventure Hero√Øc-Albums ceased publication in 1956, and Tillieux introduced his most famous character, Gil Jourdan, in Spirou magazine, where he had already worked as an illustrator since 1940. Jourdan was very similar to F√©lix, though he had clear vision and was an actual PI. Like F√©lix, he was also flanked by two sidekicks, including a police contact, both of whom provided most of the comic relief which contrasted to the earnest nature of the title character. Some of F√©lix's stories were the basis for some of Jourdan's own adventures. One major innovation of the Jourdan series was the atmosphere of the places where he would go to. Whereas previous series like The Adventures of Tintin were based in spotlessly clean homes and locations, Jordan's world was made up of dusty offices, littered streets, wet docks and mud-splattered farms. In later years Tillieux, like many leading figures in the field, stuck to writing while leaving most of the artwork to others. Gos took over the drawing of Gil Jourdan and Tillieux also contributed to other series such as Tif et Tondu and Yoko Tsuno. Another major detective series was Jess Long, the adventures of an FBI agent which were drawn by Arthur Piroton. Tillieux enjoyed action as well as humour and mystery, and many of his strips feature elaborate fights and car chases. He died from the results of a car crash near Tours on 31 January 1978, while returning from the annual Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. Humour Humour was an important element of Tillieux's work even in his detective stories. At their best F√©lix and Gil Jourdan could provide good laughs as well as good adventures and mysteries. Tillieux therefore also wrote non-detective series with the emphasis on humour. One example was C√©sar, a domestic comic strip in which the titled protagonist lives next door to a policeman. Many of the strips involve C√©sar babysitting his neighbour's little daughter. Mayhem ensues and, as a reward for his trouble, C√©sar ends up being fined by the little girl's father. Marc Lebut, drawn by Francis, are the adventures of the young owner of a Ford T car who is the bane of his long- suffering neighbour. Lebut is always dragging the poor Mister Goular into all sorts of crazy adventures and dismissing all pleas not to get involved in Mister Goular's own problems. Lebut has a way of making Mister Goular responsible when things go wrong and getting the glory for himself when they go right. He could be described as a pesky anti-hero along the lines of Jolyon Wagg from the adventures of Tintin. There was also Hultrasson (a pun on the French for ultrasound), which was drawn by Leonardo Vittorio and based in an H√§gar the Horrible-like world of Vikings. Tillieux also contributed a couple of storylines to La Ribambelle, the stories of a multi-racial gang of kids, drawn by Jean Roba and the classic series Tif et Tondu. Legacy Maurice Tillieux has been described as a \\"master of surprise, sarcasm and nonsense\\".The World Encyclopedia of Comics edited by Maurice Horn, , Along with Goscinny and Franquin, he was perhaps one of the most important contributors to post-war Belgian comics.

It is found in groups of two to eleven individuals consisting of one breeding pair and other non-reproductive individuals.  Taxonomy and systematics  During his expedition to the interior of southern Africa in 1834‚Äì35, Andrew Smith collected specimens of the white-browed sparrow weaver at the Modder River, which he described in 1836, giving it the scientific name Plocepasser mahali.  Etymology  Smith did not provide an explanation for the species epithet mahali, but is clear it is not a Latin name. Probably it is derived from the vernacular name for the bird in Setswana mogale or from the Sesotho word mohale, a brave or fierce person, which suggests the bird's name may refer to its angry scolding.  Vernacular names  Other common names used in English include black-billed mahali weaverbird, black-billed sparrow weaver, Kismayu sparrow-weaver, stripe-breasted sparrow-weaver, white-browed weaver bird, and white-crowned weaver bird.  Subspecies  There are four recognized subspecies of the white-browed sparrow-weaver: IOC World Bird List *P. m. melanorhynchus is found in eastern Africa *P. m. pectoralis is found from Botswana to Tanzania and western Mozambique *P. m. ansorgei is found in southern Angola and northern Namibia *P. m. mahali is found from southern Namibia to Zimbabwe and South Africa White-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali melanorhynchus) male.jpgmale P. m. melanorhynchus Lake Ziway, Ethiopia White-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali ansorgei) female.jpgfemale P. m. ansorgei Etosha National Park, Namibia White-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali mahali) female.jpgfemale P. m. mahali Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa White-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali pectoralis) male.jpgmale P. m. pectoralis Matetsi Safari Area, Zimbabwe Description It ranges from in length and is characterized by a broad, white eyebrow stripe and white rump visible in flight. While the male white-browed sparrow-weaver sports a black bill, the female's bill is horn-colored (light gray); that of the juvenile is pinkish- brown. In Zimbabwe, the white-browed sparrow-weaver shows faint brown spotting across its white breast. Voice The white-browed sparrow-weaver may emit either a brief chik-chick or a loud, fluid, cheoop-preeoo-chop whistle. Similar species The yellow-throated petronia has a pinkish brown (not black) bill, a buff (not white) eyebrow stripe, black (not pink) feet, and yellow shading at the bottom of a white throat. Additionally, the white-browed sparrow-weaver is larger than the yellow-throated petronia. Unlike the white- browed sparrow-weaver, the yellow-throated petronia may be found in broad- leaved woodland. Distribution and habitat  The white-browed sparrow-weaver is found in greatest numbers in north-central southern Africa. While this species most densely populates dry regions with woodland or wooded grassland at northern South Africa, its range includes Botswana, northern and central Namibia, and western Zimbabwe. It is seen very often in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia and southern Malawi. Populations may be found as far north as Ethiopia. Populations are sedentary. This species nests in colonies along thornveld and scrubby, dry riverbanks. Behaviour and ecology=Breeding Breeding has been observed year round, but occurs mainly in warmer months. Year round, groups of the white-browed sparrow-weaver are active and nest-building. Groups of ten to sixty inverted-U-shaped nests of dry grass appear in the outside limbs of trees, although only several are used for breeding or roosting. While breeding nests have only one entrance, roosting nests have an entrance located at each of the two nest extremities. Research has shown that, throughout a region, nests are located at the leeward side of a tree. This behavior preserves a greater number of intact nests for breeding and roosting. White-browed sparrow-weaver nests are sometimes used by other birds, such as the red-headed finch and ashy tit. Status The white- browed sparrow-weaver is becoming more abundant, expanding its range on southern, northern, and eastern fronts.

Pictures acknowledged in an official statement: Reception Upon its release, the 300 soundtrack received mostly negative reviews from film music reviewers, largely due to the Goldenthal plagiarism. Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks.com refused to review the album upon its release, later giving the album one star and quoting Bates as saying \\"I have as much respect for a garbage can lid as I do for the orchestra. Both of them can be entirely useful and important in the scope of a movie, if you look at them the right way.\\" Clemmensen responds \\"That's a wise statement, but it's completely irrelevant unless you can actually use that garbage can lid in a manner that doesn't break the law.\\".

Also known as Decima Projects or Decima International Arts, but more commonly simply referred to as Decima, it is owned and managed by David West, Alex Chappel, Larry McGinity and Mark Reeves. Decima have occupied various physical spaces since 1997 and have also staged a number of projects hosted by other venues, in London and around the world, including major London spaces such as the Tate Modern, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Whitechapel Gallery. Decima have also staged many conceptual, event- based and media-based projects. Ralph Rugoff in Frieze called them \\"Neo- Publicists\\", as they do not just seek press coverage, but use the mass media as their artistic medium. As well as doing art projects, events, and club nights, Decima deals in limited edition books and prints, specialising in Gilbert & George and Stephen Gill. A 2008 article in The London Paper described the gallery as \\"infamous\\" for its headline-grabbing stunts in the late 1990s, including the \\"Fuck Art and Pimp\\" exhibition where Angela Marshall pretended to offer her artwork in exchange for oral sex, the show \\"Was Jesus a Homosexual?\\" and the time that curators Alex Chappel and David West gratecrashed the Tate dressed as a pantomime cow to \\"make people think\\". Origin David C. West worked with the Factual Nonsense Gallery alongside Joshua Compston before Compston's death on 5 March 1996. Among projects on which they collaborated was The Jack Duckworth Memorial Clinic, a spoof clinic for soap opera addicts. In 1996, David C. West along with Alex Chappel formed a \\"media terrorist\\" group called a.r.t. (a reasonable thought). \\"We use the media as a canvas for art\\", explained David C. West:. \\"Stunts have included running a clinic for soap opera addicts and launching The Dennis Nilsen Tour Company.\\". Decima Street 1997-2000 The group's name originates from the address of their first gallery space which was officially launched in February 1998 at 3 Decima Studios, Decima Street, London SE1. The gallery was first occupied on 31 August 1997 by Guy Hilton, Philip Hunt, Alex Chappel and Matthew John Andrew. Guy Hilton left before the first show (he later went on to found the Guy Hilton Gallery with Angela Friese in London's East End, in 2005.) On 12 February 1998 the gallery was launched with a show named \\"Scott\\", which was organised by Matthew John Andrew and Philip Hunt. In April 1998, Decima was reported to stage \\"Fuckart & Pimp\\", a show that purported to feature a female artist producing paintings while having sex with clients. \\"With delicious predictability, the Great British Public were incensed.\\" The show was in fact a hoax. Philip Hunt and Matthew John Andrew left in November 1998 after which, Decima was managed by Alex Chappel and David C. West. On 21 August 1998, Decima sent a fax to the Tate informing them that they would be bringing a real cow to the Gallery to \\"show where food and sex connect with the world of art\\". It turned out to be the artists themselves as a Pantomime Cow. At this time, the artist Derrick Welsh was represented by and closely affiliated to Decima. In April 1999, Decima attempted to cause another splash with a show entitled \\"Was Jesus a Homosexual?\\" which was organised in conjunction with political philosopher Richard Morley. The Independent's Pandora column reported \\"Gilbert and George have installed part of a 100-year- old fountain they purchased recently, which featured the inscription \\"Jesus said if any man thirst let him come to me and let him drink\\". This now reads \\"Jesus said let him come\\". Another exhibitor, Piers Wardle, has made a crucifix with wooden balls attached by a \\"string that can be played with\\" and called it The Miracle of Holy Balls. Charles Sayer's canvas of a naked woman, legs apart, is displayed alongside eight framed biblical texts and entitled Anti-Christ I awake thee. The piece de resistance is Andrew Putland's untitled triptych depicting a black Jesus and black disciples engaged in fellatio with Christ.\\" The exhibition also featured Swedish artist Anna Livia L√∂wendahl- Atomic. When the original gallery space closed in January 2000 the name Decima continued to be used by Chappel and West for art projects. In limbo 2000-2007 Decima steadily continued organising and participating in projects during 2000-2007, albeit far less frequently. During this time, those involved with Decima became involved with other offshoot and related projects. In 2005, The Upstairs Gallery in Clerkenwell Green, London was opened by Alex Chappel and Fiona Watson while the Guy Hilton Gallery was opened in Spitalfields, London, and an art / book sales website www.drugaddict.co.uk was launched by David C. West. The latter two still exist in February 2010. Gallery 2 in Hackney Wick Decima opened an art gallery in a former peanut factory in London's Hackney Wick area on 23 February 2008 with a launch show \\"The Famous, The Infamous and the Really Quite Good\\". In March 2008, Decima began a collaboration with local galleries Elevator and Residence and local studios to plan a local Arts Festival, called Hackney Wicked. On 8 August, The first Hackney Wicked festival went ahead. Also during 2008, Decima launched their online project 'Decima TV' by webcasting a \\"chat show\\" in which comedian Aaron Barschak conducted a series of interviews with artists, namely the artists Bob & Roberta Smith, Franko B and Mark McGowan. Decima are on record as sceptical about the 2012 Olympics, which is planned for the Hackney Wick area. They comment in an article by Fay Nicholson \\"Relational Aesthetics\\"http://www.artartartgallery.com/newsitefive/files/u1/feb08artartart1.pdf The Hackney Wick Decima Gallery space closed late 2008 - early 2009. Without walls, 2009 Decima were criticised in January 2009 following an exhibition on Sunday 18th where they utilised images of missing three-year-old schoolgirl Madeleine McCann in pornographic artwork. The exhibition was branded \\"appalling and completely insensitive\\" by the NSPCC. Decima hit back with a detailed letter explaining their intentions published in the Hackney Gazette on 18 February 2009. In another statement published in the Hackney Gazette, those running Decima said \\"Decima Gallery was over three days subjected to dozens of people from Liverpool literally kicking the door in. We have just got new studio tenants and six of them were in the gallery over the weekend and were terrified......Losing these tenants and goodwill of our landlord, Decima Gallery in Hackney Wick had to close it doors on January 28 for the final time, leaving several planned exhibitions in confusion.\\" In July 2009, Decima exhibited in the Ghetto Gallery, Split, Croatia and went on to stage notable exhibitions in Kreuzberg, Berlin, Germany; Piccadilly, London and the Tate Modern, London. As well as exhibitions, in 2009 Decima also organised various film projects, performance projects, art fairs, live music events and even a Berlin rave.

It acts as a probe for the presence of the target in a Southern blot assay or, more commonly, in the simpler Dot blot assay. It is a common tool used in genetic testing, forensics, and Molecular Biology research. An ASO is typically an oligonucleotide of 15‚Äì21 nucleotide bases in length. It is designed (and used) in a way that makes it specific for only one version, or allele, of the DNA being tested. The length of the ASO, which strand it is chosen from, and the conditions by which it is bound to (and washed from) the target DNA all play a role in its specificity. These probes can usually be designed to detect a difference of as little as 1 base in the target's genetic sequence, a basic ability in the assay of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), important in genotype analysis and the Human Genome Project. To be detected after it has bound to its target, the ASO must be labeled with a radioactive, enzymatic, or fluorescent tag. The Illumina Methylation Assay technology takes advantage of ASO to detect one base pair difference (cytosine versus thymine) to measure methylation at a specific CpG site. Example Binding of the \\"S\\" ASO probe to \\"S\\" DNA (top) or \\"A\\" DNA (bottom). The human disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a genetic mutation in the codon for the sixth amino acid of the blood protein beta-hemoglobin. The normal DNA sequence G-A-G codes for the amino acid glutamate, while the mutation changes the middle adenine to a thymine, leading to the sequence G-T-G (G-U-G in the mRNA). This altered sequence substitutes a valine into the final protein, distorting its structure. To test for the presence of the mutation in a DNA sample, an ASO probe would be synthesized to be complementary to the altered sequence,Studencki AB, Conner BJ, Impraim CC, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB \\"Discrimination among the human beta A, beta S, and beta C-globin genes using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization probes.\\" Am J Hum Genet vol. 37(1), pp. 42‚Äì51 (1985). here labeled as \\"S\\". As a control, another ASO would be synthesized for the normal sequence \\"A\\". Each ASO is fully complementary to its target sequence (and will bind strongly), but has a single mismatch against its non-target allele (leading to weaker interaction). The first diagram shows how the \\"S\\" probe is fully complementary to the \\"S\\" target (top), but is partially mismatched against the \\"A\\" target (bottom). Schematic of dot-blots using the \\"A\\" or \\"S\\" ASO probes. A segment of the beta-hemoglobin genes in the sample DNA(s) would be amplified by PCR, and the resulting products applied to duplicate support membranes as Dot blots. The sample's DNA strands are separated with alkali, and each ASO probe is applied to a different blot. After hybridization, a washing protocol is used which can discriminate between the fully complementary and the mismatched hybrids. The mismatched ASOs are washed off of the blots, while the matched ASOs (and their labels) remain. In the second diagram, six samples of amplified DNA have been applied to each of the two blots. Detection of the ASO label that remains after washing allows a direct reading of the genotype of the samples, each with two copies of the beta-hemoglobin gene. Samples 1 and 4 only have the normal \\"A\\" allele, while samples 3 and 5 have both the \\"A\\" and \\"S\\" alleles (and are therefore heterozygous carriers of this recessive mutation). Samples 2 and 6 have only the \\"S\\" allele, and would be affected by the disease. The small amount of 'cross hybridization' shown is typical, and is considered in the process of interpreting the final results. Alternatives ASO analysis is only one of the methods used to detect genetic polymorphisms. Direct DNA sequencing is used to initially characterize the mutation, but is too laborious for routine screening. An earlier method, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) didn't need to know the sequence change beforehand, but required that the mutation affect the cleavage site of a Restriction Enzyme. The RFLP assay was briefly adapted to the use of oligonucleotide probes, but this technique was quickly supplanted by ASO analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified DNA. The PCR technique itself has been adapted to detect polymorphisms, as allele-specific PCR. However, the simplicity and versatility of the combined PCR/ASO method has led to its continued use, including with non-radioactive labels, and in a \\"reverse dot blot\\" format where the ASO probes are bound to the membrane and the amplified sample DNA is used for hybridization. History The use of synthetic oligonucleotides as specific probes for genetic sequence variations was pioneered by R. Bruce Wallace, working at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. In 1979 Wallace and his coworkers reported the use of ASO probes to detect variations in a single-stranded bacterial virus, and later applied the technique to cloned human genes. In 1983Conner BJ, Reyes AA, Morin C, Itakura K, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB \\"Detection of sickle cell beta S-globin allele by hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. vol. 80(1), pp. 278‚Äì282 (1983). and 1985 Wallace's lab reported the detection of the mutation for sickle cell anemia in samples of whole genomic DNA, although this application was hampered by the small amount of label that could be carried by the ASO. Fortunately PCR, a method to greatly amplify a specific segment of DNA, was also reported in 1985. In less than a year PCR had been paired with ASO analysis.Saiki RK, Bugawan TL, Horn GT, Mullis KB, and Erlich HE \\"Analysis of enzymatically amplified beta-globin and HLA-DQ DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes\\" Nature vol. 324(6093) pp. 163‚Äì166 (1986). This combination solved the problem of ASO labeling, since the amount of target DNA could be amplified over a million- fold. Also, the specificity of the PCR process itself could be added to that of the ASO probes, greatly reducing the problem of spurious binding of the ASO to non-target sequences. The combination was specific enough that it could be used in a simple Dot blot, avoiding the laborious and inefficient Southern blot method.  Other uses  ASO-PCR may also be used to detect minimal residual disease in blood cancers such as multiple myeloma.

History  In 1875 it was brought to the United States by George Valentine Nash. It was introduced as a new rose cultivar named 'American Beauty' by Bancroft and Field Bros in 1886, but quite soon identified as 'Madame Ferdinand Jamin'. In 1888, Bassett & Washburn first introduced the rose to other florists for purchase. It became a famous greenhouse variety and was the best selling rose cultivar in the United States until the 1920s. Due to its high price per stem (at least two dollars per stem right from its launch in 1886) and its popularity, the cultivar was called the million-dollar rose. Its popularity remained focused on the United States, while it is only rarely cultivated in other countries.  Symbol  The flower is commemorated in the Joseph Lamb ragtime composition \\"American Beauty Rag\\". In a pastiche Ziegfeld-style number, 'The Flower Garden Of My Heart' in the 1940 Rodgers & Hart Broadway musical PAL JOEY, one of the six 'flower' girls appears as the American Beauty Rose. The song American Beauty Rose was written in 1950 and popularized by Frank Sinatra. An American Beauty rose is hurled by an aged Italian at Major ‚Äî de Coverly, wounding him in the eye, in Joseph Heller‚Äôs novel Catch-22. The flower is a recurring motif in the Oscar-winning 1999 film American Beauty. It was also featured on the cover of the Grateful Dead album American Beauty. 'American Beauty' is the official flower of the District of Columbia. It was further adopted as the formal symbol of the upscale Lord & Taylor store chain in 1943, and as the official flower of several fraternities and sororities (Sigma Phi Delta fraternity, Mu Beta Psi fraternity, Phi Sigma Sigma sorority, Tau Beta Sigma sorority, Beta Beta Beta, a coed academic fraternity for biology majors, and Alpha Rho Omega sorority).

It is part of the national rail network and formerly part of the Wairarapa Line. Until 2010 it was one of only two passenger-only lines in the country (the second one being the Johnsonville Line), since that year the two being joined by the Onehunga Branch and later by the Manukau Branch. Services are operated by Transdev Wellington under the Metlink brand and marketed as the Melling Line. Trains run between Wellington and Melling from Monday to Friday.  History = Construction  The colonial government of William Fox passed the Railways Act in 1870, which authorised the surveying of several railway lines including one from Wellington to the Wairarapa. Surveyor John Rochfort was hired by the Public Works Department to investigate four potential routes for this line and reported back with his findings at the completion of his trip. He recommended a line following the road between Wellington and Petoni on the seaward side, running up the western side of the Hutt Valley before crossing the Hutt River at Silver Stream , heading north through Upper Hutt, up the Mungaroa and Pakuratahi Valleys, and over the Rimutaka Range to Featherston. The Public Works Department concurred with his assessment and tasked him with completing a more detailed survey including cost estimates. Construction of the Wairarapa Line was authorised by the Railways Act of 1871. A further survey was commissioned and carried out between January and April 1872. The route of the line had been decided on in March but the Government, being cautious about such a large undertaking, was only willing to commit itself to the first stage of the project. The Government entered into a contract for the construction of the formation for a railway line from Wellington to Lower Hutt with John Brogden and Sons on 10 August 1872. Work commenced later that month on the 20th with a turning-of- the-first-sod ceremony officiated by the Governor General, Sir George Bowen. Progress was slow, and by July 1873 rails had only reached the south bank of the Kaiwarra Stream. The arrival of the first locomotive in November 1873 helped to speed up the pace of construction and the rails reached Lower Hutt in January 1874. John Brogden and Sons, initially tasked with creating the formation only, were also given the job of platelaying. The next few months were spent ballasting the line with this being completed on 4 April. A special train ran two days prior to the official opening of the line to Lower Hutt and return carrying various political and civic dignitaries. The first revenue service departed Wellington on 14 April 1874, without ceremony, and arrived at Lower Hutt, also without any public reception. Even before this first train ran, the Government was already seeking to let a contract for the construction of the next section, known as the Hutt Contract. This was awarded to Charles McKirdy and covered the section from Lower Hutt to past Haywards. The formation was completed in July 1874 and he was then also awarded the contract for platelaying the section, a task that was completed in November. Despite this, train services continued to terminate at Lower Hutt. The contract for the next section to Upper Hutt, known as the River Contract, was let to Charles McKirdy while he was still working on the Hutt Contract. Once again he was also awarded the contract for platelaying the section and following the completion of the Hutt River Bridge in August 1875 the rails reached Silver Stream in December of that year. The contract was completed to Upper Hutt in January 1876 but severe flooding later that month necessitated repairs to the line, delaying the opening of the new section until 1 February. Traffic on the line had grown to such an extent by 1900 that the single-track line with its sharp curves between Wellington and Petone was becoming a serious impediment. It was decided to double-track and straighten the line and accordingly the Hutt Railway and Road Improvement Act was passed in 1903 to authorise the work. New stations were established at Petone and Lower Hutt and track duplication between these two stations was completed on 27 July 1905. The remaining work proceeded south from Petone towards Wellington but various difficulties encountered by the contractor meant that the entire double- tracked line between Lower Hutt and Lambton was not opened until 4 April 1911. The section from the Hutt Valley Junction to Lower Hutt was singled on 13 July 1958.  Operation  Following the opening of the first section of line to Lower Hutt, services ran to a timetable which scheduled three return trips per day, seven days a week. The journey was scheduled to take 30 minutes in each direction. At first there were no intermediate stops, Kaiwarra and Ngahauranga not being included until a week later. It was the following year before a stop at Korokoro was added. The Melling Branch terminates at Melling railway station. Following the completion of platelaying to Silver Stream in December 1875 some trains started running north of Lower Hutt to that station. It was not, however, until the opening of the line to Upper Hutt that services were increased beyond the original timetable. Electric services were already running on the old route of the Wairarapa Line prior to its deviation and operation as a separate branch line when, on 23 November 1953, the first electric trains started running to Lower Hutt. Completion of electrification to Melling was achieved on 1 March 1954 when Melling Branch services commenced. The Melling Branch lost the last of its freight traffic in 1981 when the goods facilities at Lower Hutt closed and the local goods shunts to Lower Hutt ceased. Goods handling was transferred to a new facility at Gracefield. For several decades following its opening as a branch line, the Melling Branch enjoyed a full complement of peak and off-peak services, seven days a week. By 1980 Sunday services had ceased and a short-lived Melling to Petone EMU shuttle service was introduced to run on Saturdays. Following the cancellation of the shuttle service trains ran only from Monday to Friday. In 1986 off-peak services were withdrawn leaving the line with only peak-time trains. For a time patronage of the line was so low that the line was in danger of being closed altogether but in 2004 off-peak weekday services were restored. The lack of weekend services has been highlighted as an issue when events are held at the Westpac Stadium. Local business owners raised concerns of access for patrons of Wellington's matches for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Requests had been made for the provision of special weekend services for these rugby matches but the Regional Council declined, saying \\"The Melling line doesn't operate on weekends anyway and this will not change during the Rugby World Cup.\\" The speed limit for trains on the Melling Line is , with a limit through the junction with the Hutt Valley Line and entering Melling station. The speed limits were lowered in mid-2014 following two incidents when trains overran Melling station and hit the stop block at the end of the line.  Deviation  End of the line. A severe shortage of coal following World War II led to the decision in February 1946 to electrify the remainder of Wellington‚Äôs suburban passenger rail network. Work had already commenced on the Hutt Valley Branch to extend it north with the intention that it eventually become the main line. It had been hoped that the branch could join the existing Wairarapa Line at Silverstream, thereby avoiding additional crossings of the Hutt River, but this was not possible due to the unstable nature of the terrain in the area around Taita Gorge. The Hutt Valley Branch officially became part of the Wairarapa Line on 1 March 1954. All Hutt Valley and Wairarapa train services commenced using the new route with the old route up the western side of the Hutt Valley having been closed to all traffic the previous day. It was also at this time that the Petone to Melling section commenced operation as the Melling Branch terminating at a new station that had been built on the south side of the Melling Link Road, thereby avoiding the need for the line to cross any roads. The old track from Melling to Manor Park was later lifted and the original Melling station, on the north side of the road, was removed several years later. As the traffic requirements of the line were greatly diminished following its change in status to that of a branch line, the double tracking between Hutt Valley Junction and Lower Hutt was deemed surplus to requirements and singled by 13 July 1958. As the branch is single line throughout and therefore can only have one train on it at a time, all but one signal - the home signal protecting the junction with the main Hutt Valley Line - were gradually removed between 1958 and December 2013. When Petone was resignalled in December 2013, the home signal was upgraded and a new distant signal was erected at Melling Station.  Services  Melling Line trains currently operate both peak and off-peak schedules from Monday to Friday only. Services arrive at and depart from Melling half-hourly (peak), hourly (off-peak). Trains stop at the following stations: * * (station closed 2013)   Future  The Melling Station will be moved under the three 2018 NZTA options for replacing the Melling road bridge. It has been suggested that the Melling Branch could be extended across the Hutt River to provide rail access to central Lower Hutt, and possibly extended to provide a cross- valley link to the Wairarapa Line at Waterloo Station. The Hutt Corridor Plan (December 2003) identified \\"Lack of direct passenger rail access to the Lower Hutt Central area\\" as an issue for the long-term vision for the corridor. However, as the Hutt Valley has low population growth, the viability of this or similar proposals remains in doubt. Another project with implications for the Melling Branch is the SH2 Melling to Haywards Upgrade which proposes to establish interchanges at the Melling and Kennedy Good intersections to improve traffic flows. The Melling interchange will also improve access to Melling Railway Station. This project was in an investigation phase, but has now been postponed for at least ten years.

In contrast, the Kushner equation gives a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation for the normalized density of the hidden state. In principle either approach allows one to estimate a quantity function (the state of a dynamical system) from noisy measurements, even when the system is non-linear (thus generalizing the earlier results of Wiener and Kalman for linear systems and solving a central problem in estimation theory). The application of this approach to a specific engineering situation may be problematic however, as these equations are quite complex. The Zakai equation is a bilinear stochastic partial differential equation. It was named after Moshe Zakai.  Overview  Assume the state of the system evolves according to :dx = f(x,t) dt + dw and a noisy measurement of the system state is available: :dz = h(x,t) dt + dv where w, v are independent Wiener processes. Then the unnormalized conditional probability density p(x,t) of the state at time t is given by the Zakai equation: :dp = L(p) dt + p h^T dz where the operator L = -\\\\sum \\\\frac{\\\\partial (f_i p)}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\frac12 \\\\sum \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j} As previously mentioned, p is an unnormalized density and thus does not necessarily integrate to 1. After solving for p, integration and normalization can be done if desired (an extra step not required in the Kushner approach). Note that if the last two terms on the right hand side are omitted (by choosing h identically zero), the result is a nonstochastic PDE: the familiar Kolmogorov forward equation, which describes the evolution of the state when no measurement information is available.

They inhabit low and moderate-gradient streams and rivers in warm, clear water in mostly unsilted gravel and rubble in runs, pools, and riffles. They are primarily insectivorous. This fish is a federally listed endangered species. Description Adults Roanoke logperches are between 80 and 115 mm SL. The light-colored body is somewhat stocky and elongated. There are dark, rounded, and vertically elongated blotches on the side. The fish have a long, cone-shaped snout with a bulbous or blunt tip. There are two dorsal fins, which are both very tall on adult males. The first dorsal fin has an orange band bordered on both sides by black bands. The end of the tail fin is almost straight. The fins have black or brown dark marks on them. The large eyes are near the top of the head of the fish. The fish's upper jaw is longer than its lower jaw. Distribution and habitat The Roanoke logperch is known only from the upper reaches of the Roanoke, Dan and Chowan river systems in Virginia, with a small population in North Carolina. It inhabits gravel and boulder runs of slow-moving, warm, small to medium-sized rivers where it is found in riffles, runs and pools with sandy, stony or boulder-strewn bottoms. Behavior These fish are sexually mature by about two to three years of age. Spawning occurs from mid-April to early May in water 12-14 ¬∞C (54-58 degrees Fahrenheit). Each female may produce from 200 to 650 eggs. The eggs are adhesive to surfaces and found on the bottom of the stream or pool. The Roanoke logperch use their conical snout to turn over gravel and feed on exposed invertebrates. This enables them to reach prey sheltered beneath rocks that may be unavailable to other benthic fishes; however, this feeding behavior relies on the availability of loosely embedded substrate. In an ecosystem, Roanoke Logperch can be an indication that the river or lake has very low turbidity. Status The Roanoke logperch is rated by the IUCN as being \\"Vulnerable\\". The threats it faces are from urbanization, the impoundment of water resulting in the silting of waterways, and industrial and agricultural pollution. Nevertheless, the population seems fairly stable and may be increasing slightly in the Pigg River.

Ben Gurion International Airport serves as Jerusalem's closest international airport. Egged bus lines and Israel Railways connect the city of Jerusalem to much of Israel, and a high-speed rail line to the airport and Tel Aviv is currently under construction, while the segment to Ben Gurion Airport is already in limited operation. Within the city, the roads, rather than the rails, are the primary mode of transportation. Jerusalem Central Bus Station Roads Begin Highway (Highway 50) is the western inner city expressway in Jerusalem. It runs north to south from Atarot to Manahat (Malha), and is being extended to link further south into Highway 60 to Gush Etzion. The northern end of the highway is fed by Highway 443 from Tel Aviv and Modiin. The Atarot-Talpiot route (Highway 60) is the main route which traverses the center of the city; and Herzl Boulevard, which begins at the northern entrance of the city and continues south via Mount Herzl and the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. It then merges into additional routes that lead to the southwestern quarters. The Golomb-Herzog- Ben-Zvi route also links the southern quarters with the city center. Running east through the city center, Jaffa Road connects the Jaffa Gate of the Old City as well as the central-eastern neighbourhoods and the northwestern city entrance to Highway 1. Highway 1 bypasses the city-centre to the north as Yigael Yadin Boulevard, and links Ma'ale Adummim to Begin Highway near Ramot. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35-kilometer (22-mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs and the city center. The eastern half of the project was conceptualized decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed. Buses Route 99 tourist bus Jerusalem Central Bus Station is Jerusalem's main intercity bus station. The city is served mainly by Egged buses, though as of 2009, a number of other companies are providing an increasing number of bus lines to and from the city also; as of 2009, Dan and Superbus also use the Central Bus Station. City buses in Jerusalem are run by Egged, which runs close to 100 bus lines throughout the city and its suburbs. A map of the various lines may be accessed on MobileMehttp://web.me.com/jerubus/English_Site/Jerusalem_Bus_Map_files/English_New_2.pdf Two joint Egged‚ÄìDan bus lines serve the Bnei Brak ‚Äì Jerusalem route, while Superbus and Veolia serve Modi'in Illit and Modi'in respectively. As of December 2008, Superbus also provides all bus routes in the Jerusalem corridor, between Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh. The Illit company provides bus lines to Beitar Illit. East Jerusalem Arab-run buses serve the city's Arab neighborhoods in Eastern Jerusalem and also some Palestinian towns in the Palestinian Authority and Israeli Arab towns. This system is based out of the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station on Sultan Suleiman Street, though buses also leave from outside the Damascus Gate of the Old City. The Egged and the East Jerusalem Arab city bus networks are almost completely separated. There are a handful of bus stops served by both companies. Arab residents of East Jerusalem indeed use Egged buses, but Jewish residents rarely use the East Jerusalem Arab buses, in part because while Arabs of East Jerusalem occasionally visit the Jewish parts of Jerusalem, Jews do not frequently visit Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods. Trains Jerusalem train Israel Railways operates two separate train lines to Jerusalem. The main line is the new high- speed rail link, which opened in 2018, with an expected transit time from Tel Aviv of about 30 minutes. It runs from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem via Ben Gurion Airport and terminates at a new underground station, Jerusalem‚ÄìYitzhak Navon railway station, located between the Jerusalem Central Bus Station and the International Convention Center. The older line goes from Bet Shemesh to Southern Jerusalem with 2 stops: Jerusalem Malha near the Malha Mall and Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. This line was originally part of the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway, which opened in 1892. It was out of use for seven years because of deteriorating conditions and was restored on April 9, 2005. Jerusalem Malha is a new station which replaces the historical Khan Station at Remez Square near the Old City. Light rail Jerusalem Chords Bridge Light Rail tram on Jaffa Road The first line of the Jerusalem Light Rail network was completed in 2010 with the erection of Santiago Calatrava's Chords Bridge over Jaffa Road. The first line began operating from Pisgat Ze'ev in the northeast, through French Hill and Jaffa Road to the Central Bus Station and the southwestern neighborhoods.Jerusalem Light Rail ‚Äî Mass Transit System (PDF) The line was fully operational by late 2011, after several delays, with 14 trains and a maximum headway of 12 minutes.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History and Description Built around 1850 by the Ownby Family, it was constructed as a one-room cabin from poplar logs. The building has a gable roof, an exterior cobblestone and concrete chimney and a stone foundation. The main cabin is rectangular by . The logs are half dovetail notched with both mud and concrete chinking. Originally, there was only a single window and door in the cabin and no stone fireplace. Two of the entrance doors are vertical board design and date to about 1910. On the rear or east is a shed roof wing with vertical board siding that contains a kitchen and an enclosed porch. It was purchased in 1918 by Frank Avent, husband of Mayna Avent, for $200 from the Ownby family and remodeled into its present appearance in 1926. Ownership of the cabin and its of land was transferred to the National Park Service in 1932. A lease was given to the son of Frank and Mayna Avent, James Avent and his wife Jeannette and remained with the Avent family until its expiration in 1992. Significant alternations were made in 1972, some of which were removed in 1992-1993 when the Avent lease expired to restore it to be closer to its appearance when it was used as a studio. It is the only authentic Appalachian Settler cabin that remains along Jake's Creek in its original location.Douglas Harnsberger, , 1 May 1993. Use as the Avent Studio Mayna Avent began using the cabin as a studio in 1919 and continued to do so for over 20 years. Several alterations to the structure were made to make it more conducive for studio use. For example, to improve illumination, two large openings were created: a window at the southwest elevation, and at the southeast wall, a pane glassed door providing access to the porch. A stone fireplace and stone chimney were constructed at the northeast wall. Location The cabin is located approximately south of Elkmont, Tennessee on the west side of Jake's Creek Valley. It is accessible on the Jake's Creek Trail which passes approximately to the east of the cabin. A footpath winds down to Jake's Creek crossing over traces of the old Elkmont Road, crosses over the Creek by a foot-log bridge, and up the ridge where the cabin is located on a steep bluff. At an altitude of , the cabin lies on a steep side of a ridge overlooking Jake's Creek Valley. Small areas of the forest were cleared by the Ownby family for apple orchards, potato and corn fields and for bee-keeping. Stone retaining walls, some of which can still be seen, were constructed to support the leveling of the topology for agricultural use.

Education Hearn was a student at Brentwood School, Essex. He failed to make it into sixth form at Brentwood School as he flunked his GCSEs. Hearn played cricket and football at a decent level, and his father Barry petitioned the school to let him stay on for his sporting record, but the school refused. Eddie said, \\"I grew up thinking I was a hard nut and in Brentwood School I was. Anywhere else I was a pansy.\\" He then went to Havering Sixth Form College in Hornchurch, which was less selective. Barry encouraged Eddie to study by promising him ¬£1,000 for a C or better grade in his A-level subjects, which were media studies, physical education and business studies. Eddie achieved 2 Cs and 1 A. Boxing promoter Matchroom Sport was founded by his father, Barry Hearn. As group managing director, Eddie Hearn focuses on Matchroom Boxing and fulfilling the company's exclusive televised boxing deal with UK Broadcaster Sky Sports, to broadcast up to 20 shows a year. After leaving education, Hearn started a career in the West End at a sports management company representing golfers, eventually moving on to promote online Poker with Matchroom with the events being broadcast worldwide. In the UK they were broadcast by Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky Sports. He met Audley Harrison at a poker game and agreed to help him rebuild his career, subsequently getting Harrison a fight with David Haye, signalling the growth of Matchroom Boxing. In May 2018, Hearn revealed boxing's first $1 billion boxing deal (¬£750 million) as Matchroom and streaming service DAZN signed an agreement to stream shows across America. At the heart of the deal, Hearn and Matchroom Boxing will stage 16 shows in America, which will be streamed exclusively on DAZN in the U.S., while 16 of his UK shows will also be shown on the platform. Hearn has promoted some large events in recent times, including Joshua vs. Klitshcko at Wembley Stadium, which saw 90,000 in attendance and has been named one of the biggest fights in boxing history. Matchroom Boxing have put on many big nights and PPV events in the UK with many in attendance shown by their UK broadcaster Sky Sports. Hearn promotes and has promoted many world champions and highly ranked fighters since joining Matchroom Sport, including Anthony Joshua, Josh Warrington, Amir Khan, Kell Brook, Oleksandr Usyk, Vasyl Lomachenko, Mikey Garcia, Cecilia Br√¶khus, Artur Beterbiev, Dillian Whyte, Luke Campbell, Danny Jacobs, Billy Joe Saunders, Tony Bellew, Callum Smith, Joseph Parker, Maurice Hooker, Katie Taylor and others. In 2019, Hearn signed co-promotional deals with Gennady Golovkin and Devin Haney, with their fights to be aired on DAZN in the U.S. and Sky Sports in the UK. He also agreed a deal to promote a professional boxing match between the YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul, which took place on 9 November 2019. This match was heavily criticised by boxing fans across the globe, they claimed KSI and Paul were not suitable to be promoted by Hearn, due to their lack of experience. The fight ended with KSI winning by split decision. Hearn came under criticism for staging Ruiz Jr. vs. Joshua II in Saudi Arabia, due to the country's human rights record. He defended the decision by stating that Saudi Arabia wanted to improve its image and that his job \\"is to provide the best opportunities for our fighters.\\" Personal life Hearn lives in Billericay in Essex with his wife Chloe and their two daughters Sophia and Isabella.

Persecution from the communist government and the fact that he came from an old Protestant family and refused to renounce his belief significantly delayed his academic career. Despite his international renown, it took him ten years to have his habilitation officially approved and he was only made Professor in 1990.Svoboda, A.: \\"Jan Firbas - An outstanding personality of European linguistics\\" in J. Hladk√Ω (Ed.): Language and Function. To the Memory of Jan Firbas. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, pp. 1-8. In 1986, he was awarded Honorary Doctorates by the Universities of Leuven and Leeds, and in 2000 by the University of Turku. Even though he was frequently invited to give lecture series at universities across the globe in the 1970s and 80s, he could freely accept the invitations only after the fall of the communist regime in November 1989. Jan Firbas died on 5 May 2000 in Brno, the city where he had stayed for most of his life. Firbas developed a theory of Information Structure called Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), inspired by the work of Vil√©m Mathesius. It is Jan Firbas who is to be credited with the first use of the term Functional Sentence Perspective.Firbas, J.: \\"Round table on functional linguistics, 1st April 1993, University of Vienna: Prof. J. Firbas\\", VIenna English Working paperS, Vol.3, No.1, 1994, pp. 4‚Äì5 He wrote more than 100 papers on the subjectGolkov√°, E.: \\"Bibliography of the publications of Professor Jan Firbas, PhDr, DrSc, Dr.h.c.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 1992. Firbas's most diligent disciple was Ale≈° Svoboda, with whom he closely collaborated especially in the 1970s and 1980s on the development and refinement of the key concepts in the theory of Functional Sentence Perspective. The most important contribution of Jan Firbas to the study of information structure of language was to highlight the fact that \\"word-order is not the only means of FSP\\",Firbas, J.: \\"Ze srovn√°vac√≠ch studi√≠ slovosledn√Ωch.

Firbas's further investigation of the means of FSP lead him to postulate a systemic view of FSPFirbas, J.: \\"A systemic view of functional sentence perspective\\" in T.

Davies and L. Ravelli (Eds): Advances in Systemic Linguistics: Recent Theory and Practice, London/New York: Pinter, 1992, p. 178 The work of Jan Firbas, covering not only the FSP theory but also other topics in linguistics, is now being edited by his followers into a five-volume collection of his articles titled Collected Works of Jan Firbas ().

It is the third film spin-off from the television series Up Pompeii! (the previous films being Up the Chastity Belt set in the Middle Ages which followed on from the Up Pompeii film). The plot concerns Lurk (a descendant of the slave Lurcio in Up Pompeii), a coward who is hypnotised into bravery. Plot Set during World War I, Lurk, a lowly servant in the household of Lord and Lady Twithampton (William Mervyn and Linda Gray), is hypnotised by The Great Vincento (Stanley Holloway) and travels to the Western Front to 'save England'. Lurk is inspired to bravery, and upon receiving the German master plan for the entire war, which has through an unlikely series of events been tattooed onto his posterior, is pursued across France by German intelligence. After breaking into the British military headquarters to deliver the plans into the hands of General Burke (Robert Coote), he is confronted by the sensuous German spy Mata Hari (Zsa Zsa Gabor). After foiling Mata Hari's scheme to relieve him of the plan, a hilarious scene develops in which he is pursued by the nefarious Von Gutz (Lance Percival) and his henchmen Donner and Blitzen (Gertan Klauber and Stanley Lebor). Accompanied by the Can-Can, performed by the Famous Buttercup Girls, Lurk is pursued around the Allied headquarters. Finally, disguised as a tree, he is able to present the plans to General Burke, to the famous line: > General Burke: \\"Lurk, bend down.\\" > Lurk: \\"I thought you'd never ask!\\" Having successfully delivered the plans into the hands of British intelligence, Lurk receives a medal of honour and a promotion. He is therefore able to win the love of his beloved Fanny (Madeline Smith) and defeat the machinations of the wicked Sgt. Major Groping (Bill Fraser).

In 1915, it expanded into a Carnegie library that would remain open until the establishment of a new Central Library was built across the street in 1967. On October 16, 2007, the Wichita City Council decided on the preferred site for a new central library at Second Street and McLean. The initial building program resulted in a projected budget exceeding the amount allotted, forcing the Library to consider alternatives. In 2011, a study found that expanding the current Central Library facility would be possible, but would be more expensive than building a new facility and would not resolve building access issues. In 2012-13, the Library's Board of Directors considered a phased construction approach. The City Council authorized a request for qualifications, with a presentation by a preferred design team in summer 2014. In January 2015, Wichita City Council voted in favor of a funding agreement with the library foundation to perform the design phase.Wichita City Council votes 5-2 to move ahead with library plans; The Wichita Eagle; January 13, 2015. The new facility, named the Advanced Learning Library, cost an estimated $33 million library. It is two stories and has of interior space; it is also designed to withstand storms and act as a storm shelter. The Advanced Learning Library opened on June 16, 2018. In December 2014, the \\"Orchard Park\\" branch inside Orchard Park Recreation Center at 4808 West 9th was closed.Orchard Park library in west Wichita to close Dec. 19; The Wichita Eagle; November 30, 2014. The Comotara Branch Library, located inside a Dillons supermarket since 1986, was the first branch library branch in the United States to open in a grocery store. The branch closed in July 2018 so Dillons could reclaim the space. Reference services and resources The Wichita Public Library offers resources including reference in person, by telephone, mail and e-mail. As of 2011, its holdings included more than 1 million volumes The library offers the most research capabilities from its Advanced Learning Library, located downtown.

He was born in Princeton, Massachusetts, and at first worked as a goldsmith, also practicing engraving. Although seemingly untrained in painting, he came into prominence in 1790 through his portrait of George Washington, intended as a gift to Harvard University. In 1791 he visited London, where he studied for a time under Benjamin West, and then went to Italy. Upon his return to the United States in 1794, he practiced in Philadelphia and New York City, maintaining for several years a picture gallery and art museum on Water Street in New York. Robert Edge Pine began the first representation of Congress Voting Independence (Historical Society of Pennsylvania Collection, Atwater Kent Museum, Philadelphia) in 1784, but it was unfinished at his death. Savage completed the painting in 1801, and mass-produced the image as a mezzotint. Its portraits of Anthony Wayne, Benjamin Rush, and Thomas Jefferson are highly esteemed. Savage is principally known, however, for a large portrait group, The Washington Family (begun 1789, completed 1796), portraying President George Washington, First Lady Martha Washington, two of her grandchildren, George Washington Parke Custis and Eleanor Parke Custis, and an enslaved servant, probably Christopher Sheels.

It is located south of the Kanawha River, west of the city of Charleston, in the city of South Charleston's Spring Hill neighborhood. The school mascot is the Black Eagle. SCHS is a Class AAA school, which is the highest enrollment classification of high school sports in West Virginia. The Black Eagles football team went 14-0 and won the 2008 Class AAA State title in a 39-8 win over George Washington High School on December 6, 2008. History South Charleston High School has called three buildings home since it was created over 80 years ago. The original Louden District High School was built in downtown South Charleston in 1925. A newer building was built a few blocks from the old building, still in downtown South Charleston, in 1931. South Charleston High was moved to the larger building; South Charleston Junior High School moved into the 1925 building, from the old 1931 building, which was across the street from the \\"old rec center\\" at Oakes Field. It was pentagon shaped, 3 story. In 1971 a new, much larger school and campus complex was built on the former site of Southmoor Country Club in the Spring Hill area of town. South Charleston Junior High School was moved from the original 1925 building to the old South Charleston High School. The current South Charleston Middle School building today still has Louden District High School engraved into the stone. The South Charleston High School \\"Black Eagle Band\\" has been around almost as long as the school. The original band was organized in 1932 with only three members participating. The first band was led by Charles Gorby, whose music store founded in 1946 in downtown South Charleston is somewhat of a local landmark. The band has seen enrollment of up to 110 members at one time. In 1990, South Charleston's rival school Dunbar High School was closed and those students were transferred across the Kanawha River to South Charleston High School. South Charleston High school, along with George Washington High School, made national headlines in 1992, when, during an illegal off-campus Senior Skip Day party with other students from South Charleston High School, two students were shot and killed over an argument about payment for a keg of beer. In 1999, SCHS became the first school in West Virginia to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program. SCHS is still the only high school in West Virginia to offer the IB program, more than ten years after it was introduced into the state. School renovations South Charleston High School underwent several renovations, including the completion of a commons area, more classrooms and an auxiliary gym, to make room for ninth graders students in 2001 when the school changed from grades 10-12 to include freshman. A commons area referred to by the students and staff as the \\"Piazza\\" was added to the front of the school and became the current entrance to the building. It serves as a commons area and houses a concession stand, a garden, waterfall and seating areas. The entrance to the gym, theater, auxiliary gym and offices can all be accessed from the commons area. The auxiliary gym was added to allow gym classes and sports practices at the same time. The new classrooms were added to the back of the school that now house the history department and are referred to as \\"The New Wing\\" by students and staff. The cafeteria was also made larger to make room for the upcoming students. Athletics South Charleston has many athletic programs available to students. The football program won the State Championship in school years 1945-1946, 1994‚Äì1995, 2008‚Äì09 and 2009-10 for Class AAA. The school was also named State Runner-Up in the 2014-15 school year, after a loss to Capital High School in the AAA State Championship. In 2008, the Black Eagles capped a 14-0 season with a 39-8 rout of George Washington to win the Class AAA Football State Championship. After a 13-1 season, it also won the 2009-10 AAA State Championships against Brooke 28-7. The basketball team won the State Championship in the 1958-1959 school year, and has made numerous state tournament appearances. The baseball team won the state championship in 1976-1977, 1977‚Äì1978 and 2005-2006. The cheerleaders, tennis team, track team, swim team, softball team, and soccer team have all made their mark on West Virginia State high school athletics as well. The football team played the first on-campus game on September 6, 2013. In the past, they did not play games on campus. Instead, they played at Oakes Field, built in the 1920s with a seating capacity of about 2,000 fans, in downtown South Charleston. The boys' basketball team previously played at the high school in the \\"Old Pro Gymnasium\\" named in honor of long-time Coach Marv \\"The Old Pro\\" Richardson. The gym holds around 1,000. The basketball teams now play at the South Charleston Recreational Center. The baseball field, softball field, tennis courts, and track are all on campus. The swim team practices at the South Charleston Community Center and the soccer team plays at Little Creek Park. The Student Spirit Organization at the school heavily participates during football and basketball season. The students commonly wear all orange on game nights and sit in a student section referred to as \\"Orange Nation.\\" Band The South Charleston High School marching band is one of the eight public high schools that compete in the Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival. Although they have never won the Festival Grand Championship, they have had the most girls named Miss Kanawha Majorette, the first girl to ever be named Miss Kanawha Majorette, and, currently, the only girl to be named Miss Kanawha Majorette twice.

The film chronicles how pro-Palestinian student activists staged a direct action aimed to cancel the former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on campus. The talk by the prime minister had been organized by Hillel, a Jewish student organization.Confrontation @ Concordia (CAMERA) Transcript (Appendix A to CIII-TV (Global Television) re Confrontation at Concordia (CBSC Decision 02/03-1340, -1368, -1514 and -1530, April 26, 2004)) The documentary portrays the events that took place in a negative light, and reportedly contributed to the ensuing media debate over them. The Concordia Student Union (CSU) responded by taking legal action against its producer.Anti-Israeli Activity at Concordia University 2000-2003 by Corinne Berzon, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, September 25, 2008 Synopsis The documentary opens with scenes of the violence at the event, depicting fighting between protesters and Jewish students attempting to enter the venue. This is followed by an interview with student Samir Elitrosh, a leader of the Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and the leader of anti- Israel violence who was later suspended. It also features interviews with Concordia's Hillel president Yoni Petel and Concordia rector Frederick Lowy, and concludes with a discussion of what it sees as the growing trend of anti- Israel activities on North American campuses.Film examines violence. Professor offers ways to counter hate on campuses by Kyle Berger (Jewish Independent) August 22, 2003 The documentary presents footage of pro-Palestinian activists breaking windows and pushing and shoving to block the only entry to the lecture hall. The pro-Palestinian students had objected strongly to Netanyahu's attempt to give scheduled speech.Charges against Netanyahu protester dropped By Janice Arnold (Canadian Jewish News) In a segment of the film Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the conduct of Concordia students: > ... what you have is an implantation in North America of this same > unforgiving fanaticism that says \\"we will not allow the engagement of a > contest of ideas, we will not allow a free market of ideas,\\" which is > precisely a microcosm of the problem that we have in these societies that > spawn and produce terrorism. They rigidly control what their people hear and > see so that they can control what they think and feel. And this is the > essence of the problem. If the real solution to this fanaticism is > ventilation, the aeration of various ideas, then you got a whiff of the > underlying root cause of terrorism in Concordia. That is the unwillingness > to have a free exchange of ideas. The root cause of terrorism is > totalitarianism. In the film, Thomas Hecht, a former member of the Board of Governors of Concordia University and a Holocaust survivor, states: In response to allegations of antisemitism, Elitrosh, leader of the Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, averred that one can be anti-Israel without being antisemitic. He stated that \\"Judaism existed before the state of Israel.\\" Controversy The film set off a series of debates regarding student politics and whether anti-Israeli/pro-Palestinian political rallies on campuses were anti-Semitic. Criticism Antonia Zebisias, media critic of the Toronto Star criticized the documentary for making hyperbolic comparisons between the riot and Kristallnacht, for giving the president of Hillel more air time than was given to the Palestinian side, and for not supporting many of its contentions with facts. It also noted the potential conflict of interests due to the fact that the film was aired on Global TV which is owned by CanWest, the media outlet which in part helped organize the invitation of Netanyahu to speak.Global Documentary Seems Unfair After the documentary was broadcast on Global Television, Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) received a number of complaints relating to the program. The complaints were considered under the provisions of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters' (CAB) Code of Ethics and the Radio and Television News Directors Association of Canada (RTNDA) Code of (Journalistic) Ethics. The CBSC concluded that none of the provisions of the either the CAB Code of Ethics or the RTNDA Code of (Journalistic) Ethics were breached.CIII-TV (Global Television) re Confrontation at Concordia Canadian Broadcast Standards Council National Conventional Television Panel.

Predecessor BFC Stern was one of the founding clubs of the German Football Association in 1900.  History = Berliner Fu√üball-Club Stern vom Jahre 1889  Predecessor side Stern was established in early 1889 as Berliner Fu√üball-Club Marbert and was renamed on 3 May 1889 to Berliner FC Stern 89.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon- Sportverlag. . The club played a single season in the top-flight Oberliga Berlin in 1906‚Äì07 and was relegated after an 8th-place result. They took part in the Berliner Pokal (Berlin Cup) in 1926 and advanced to the quarterfinals where they were put out by BFC Vorw√§rts 90 Berlin (2:3). Stern remained a lower circuit team through to the end of World War II. Their achievements were modest with their highest advance being to the Berzirksliga Berlin in 1939. Following the conflict, occupying Allied authorities banned organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of de-Nazification. Stern re-emerged on 8 July 1950 as 1. FC Neuk√∂lln Stern. They earned promotion to the Amateurliga Berlin (III) in 1953 with their best result coming the following season when they finished in third place. Neuk√∂lln were relegated after the 1957‚Äì58 season after crashing to 15th place and disappeared into lower division competition.  SV Stern Britz 1889  Stern merged with Spielvereinigung Britz S√ºd 1949 on 15 June 1973 making the transition from a football club to a more broadly based sports club called Sportverein Stern Britz 1889 that also included departments for dance, darts, and swimming. Today the association offers its members aerobics, cheerleading, dance, and American football while still fielding its traditional football side. Much of the football department's focus has turned to its youth teams. The American football team was founded as an independent club known as the Berlin Thunderbirds in 1992 and joined SV the following year. By 2002 it had grown into Berlin's largest American football team with close to 300 members.

It was formed on 6 December 1907 and provides intelligence personnel in every formation headquarters in the Army.Dennis (et al) 2008, p. 65. , the corps consisted of \\"169 officers and 232 other ranks\\". Role The role of the Australian Intelligence Corps is to provide intelligence support, consisting of knowledge of the enemy and the area of operations. Its role also includes active and passive measures undertaken to prevent the enemy from acquiring intelligence about friendly forces and their intentions. History The corps was formed on 6 December 1907 with the aim of providing training for soldiers in intelligence work, including collecting and recording topographic and military information about Australia, its dependencies and foreign countries (especially those of the Pacific region), as well as preparing strategic and tactical maps and plans. The first Director of Military Intelligence was Lieutenant Colonel James Whiteside McCay. The corps was disbanded on 30 September 1914 and replaced by Intelligence Sections of the General Staff in each Australian military district. It was re-formed in 1939 and was tasked with the following: intelligence; security; passport control; rail, air and shipping security; censorship; and prisoner of war interrogation and data compilation. The corps has been formally allied with the British Army Intelligence Corps since 1950. Corps Embellishments The AUSTINT badge The AUSTINT colours are green on scarlet on black. Green symbolises the Corps' alliance with the British Army Intelligence Corps, black for the Corps' links with the Australian Staff Corps and scarlet, signifying the Corps combat support role. The AUSTINT badge was modelled on the British Army Intelligence Corps badge and accepted in 1953. It has the motif of a white and red Tudor rose which is flanked by laurel leaves and rests on a scroll inscribed with \\"Australian Intelligence Corps\\". A crown surmounts the whole motif. The Rose symbolises security, confidentiality and trustworthiness, derived from the Cromwellian use of a rose displayed to indicate when secret matters were being discussed. The laurel wreath depicts honour and the crown represents allegiance to the Sovereign. Training Members of the Intelligence Corps work in the following areas: * Intelligence analysis; * Combat intelligence; * Security intelligence; * Language translation and interpretation; * Electronic warfare; * Human intelligence; * Counter intelligence; * Imagery intelligence; * Geospatial intelligence; * Multi-Media; and * Psychological operations. Recruits can now join AUSTINT through direct entry. Soldiers accepted into the Intelligence Corps attend 11 weeks employment training, consisting of a three- week introduction course and an eight-week land intelligence course. Both courses are conducted at the Defence Intelligence Training Centre in Canungra, Queensland. Training for Intelligence Corps soldiers is broken into two main streams, text and diagram. Officers are able to enter the Intelligence Corps after completing their officer course at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. However they must undergo a rigorous selection process before being employed in the Corps. Intelligence Corps staff work with the Defence Intelligence Organisation, Defence Signals Directorate and Defence Security Authority. There are also intelligence officers and staff on most of the major Army commands and headquarters providing operational or counter intelligence support.

The band's manager announced it on their messageboard on March 17, 2007 along with Capitol Records announcing it on several websites. The song was performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on April 12, 2007. It was released to Top 40 and Hot AC stations on April 10. Matt Thiessen, the lead singer, has described the song as, \\"The anti-Daniel Powter 'Bad Day' song, it's straight up positive.\\" The song peaked at No. 47 on the Top 40 charts. Around mid-February 2008, the song was released to Christian Hit Radio. It was the 18th most-played song of 2008 on U.S. Contemporary Christian music radio stations according to R&R; magazine's Christian CHR chart.2008 Year End Charts/Top Christian CHR songs , R&R; magazine, Retrieved January 15, 2009 The song was included on the WOW Hits 2009 compilation album. Promotional use The song was used for promotion of ABC's Fall preview week. The commercial features the intro to the song and the chorus while showing clips of the ABC hit shows. Music video The band originally announced the video when they said that the music video for the song was shot on April 13, 2007. They announced this at their show at the Avalon with Mae and Sherwood in Hollywood the day of the shoot. Early screenshots released by the band suggested that this video takes place in an abandoned building or apartment. Upon the video's release on May 30, 2007, it was revealed that the video's main theme is a girl taking pictures, which turn out to be of the band performing. The pictures that pop up show all the band members playing. The pictures piece together throughout the video, sometimes showing separate members, and sometimes showing multiple views of the same member. It is somewhat made up of animation, which is something Matt Thiessen had wanted in one of their videos. It is the only Relient K video where drummer Dave Douglas is shown singing backing vocals with a microphone, despite the fact that he sings backing vocals for all the songs the band has released videos for since Douglas joined the band. This is also the first video where Matt Thiessen is seen playing the piano, despite the fact that he has piano parts in the previous three songs that the band has made into videos. As of this video, guitarist Jon Schneck and bassist John Warne have officially been in more Relient K videos (four total) than longtime Relient K bassist Brian Pittman, who was in the band's first three videos. The video is up to more than 850,000 viewings on YouTube.

Originally it was known as Mountain Road or Ancaster Road. It starts off at the base of Arkledun Avenue, a Mountain-access road in the city, just east of St. Joseph's Hospital, where it is a one-way street going north and tunnels underneath the Hunter Street Railway bridge and continues onward to the city's North End at the waterfront, where it ends at Guise Street East, the site of Pier 9. History Talk of creating a townsite at what is now the intersection of John and Main streets arose as early as 1809, but the war delayed the scheme until 1816 when George Hamilton and Nathaniel Hughson successfully promoted Hamilton as the judicial centre for the counties of Halton and Wentworth (the Gore District). GO Transit station, view from John & Haymarket Streets When the Town of Hamilton was incorporated in 1833, one of the first orders of business was to find a suitable place for the town board to meet. For the first few years they made do with meeting in local taverns such as Thomas Wilson's Inn on the corner of John and Jackson Streets. John Street is also one of the original native pathways in the area. In 1837, the police commission officially named it John Street - a name originally chosen by George Hamilton (City founder), apparently in honour of a family of early settlers. The Sir John A. Macdonald Statue at Gore Park arrived in Hamilton from London, England on 30 October 1893. Official dedication of the statue took place 1 November 1893. Originally, the statue was located at the intersection of King and Hughson Streets and pointed West. Prime Minister Sir John Thompson was in attendance. Alexander Aitchison, a local Hamilton Fire Chief, died of injuries he sustained from crashing into the base of the statue with his horse and buggy and because of it, the statue was then relocated to Gore Park near King and John Streets only this time the statue instead of pointing West, now points East. Ronnie Hawkins came to Canada in 1958. His first gig was at the Golden Rail in Hamilton near the corner of King and John Streets where he became an overnight success. It was a result of Hawkins success in Hamilton that he decided to move to Canada permanently. His career spans over five decades and 25 records.

A black comedy fictionalising the assassination conspiracy of President John F. Kennedy, its all-star cast includes Jeff Bridges, John Huston, Anthony Perkins, Eli Wallach, Richard Boone, Toshir≈ç Mifune, Sterling Hayden, Dorothy Malone, Belinda Bauer, Ralph Meeker, Elizabeth Taylor, Berry Berenson and Susan Walden. The film simplifies the plot of the book somewhat, emphasizing humor. It follows the events surrounding the assassination of the fictional President Kegan (patterned after John F. Kennedy). Several years later, Kegan's half-brother Nick (Bridges) discovers leads which suggest there may have been a plot to kill the President. Most of the film was photographed by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, and the production designer was Robert F. Boyle, who cited the film as one of his favorites. Although Winter Kills was a box office bomb,\\"Winter Kills,\\" Box Office Mojo.Accessed Nov. 2, 2017. it has since become a cult classic. Plot On February 22, 1960, President of the United States Timothy Kegan is shot and killed by a sniper during a visit to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A subsequent federal investigation named the sole perpetrator to be a lone gunman named Willie Arnold, who is murdered by nightclub owner Joe Diamond before he can stand trial. 19 years later, Nick Kegan, half-brother of Timothy and heir to the wealthy Kegan dynasty, is on his father's oil tanker when a helicopter lands carrying Keifetz, a family associate, and a heavily-bandaged man named Arthur Fletcher. Carried into sick bay, Fletcher tells an orderly that in 1960 he and another gunman were hired by a man named Casper Jr. to assassinate President Kegan, with Arnold set up as a patsy. Fletcher claims to have stashed the rifle used in the assassination in room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia. Before Nick can question him any further, Fletcher dies of his injuries. Nick, accompanied by his friend Miles Gardner and Police Captain Heller, travels to Philadelphia; uncovering the rifle from its hiding place just as Fletcher said. As the three are leaving, a gum-chewing young woman on a bicycle passes by, and seconds later an unseen sniper shoots and kills Nick's companions. In a panic, Nick rushes to a payphone and tries to call his father, but is instead connected to his chief accountant John Cerruti. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts, Cerruti promises to send help, but the rifle is stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits. Nick travels to his father \\"Pa\\" Kegan's California desert estate, only to be promptly rebuked for leaving the tanker. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia, he initially storms off, but later resolves to help Nick expose the assassination conspiracy. Nick learns that Captain Heller has been dead for over two years, the one killed in Philadelphia was an imposter. Pa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the wealthiest men in the U.S., Z.K. Dawson. Threatening Nick with a tank, Dawson maintains his innocence, but implicates the real Heller and his right-hand man Lt. Roy Doty. Pa calls Nick to tell him that Keifetz and the orderly that recorded Fletcher's confession have both died under mysterious circumstances. Nick meets Doty, who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession, Casper, Jr., was connected to the Philadelphia police through Joe Diamond. According to Doty, Diamond bribed Captain Heller for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat. Diamond died in prison four years after the killing of Arnold. Nick asks his girlfriend Yvette Malone to help him track down information about Joe Diamond through her employer, National Magazine. She directs him to a Cleveland, Ohio diner, where he meets gangster Irving Mentor and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper, Jr., figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an affair with the President. Just then, the same woman on the bicycle who appeared before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes from a bomb, the woman escaping. Nick returns to New York, where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo, who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled, Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later, the hostile doorman at Yvette's apartment insists that she does not live there. Returning home, Nick finds Keifetz, who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters, Cerrutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr., and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti, a Washington, D.C. madam named Lola Comante, who obliged the president's fondness for sex, offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal, he ended their relationship, leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated. Changing the story yet again, Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z.K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter, Yvette, were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette, formerly known as Maggie Dawson, was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick assaults and fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton, he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is \\"tied up\\" at Kegan Medical School, Nick leaves to find her body in the morgue. Sometime later, Nick confronts his father in his office, but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police, Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however, Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself, Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz, who shoots back at the officer as he dies. Nick chases his father onto the high-rise balcony and finds Pa clinging to the rail of an enormous American flag. As Nick reaches for his father, Pa falls to his death, tearing the flag in half with his body as he calls out to Nick: \\"put my money in South America!\\". Nick staggers away, but tells the secretary that he will return because he cannot escape his family ties. Leaving the Kegan building, he has one final encounter with the woman on the bicycle, who waves at him but rides away uneventfully. Sometime later, Nick calls Yvette's answering machine to hear her voice one last time.

S. Moonje, also B. S. Munje, 12 December 1872 ‚Äì 3 March 1948) was a leader of the Hindu Mahasabha in India.  Early life  Moonje was born into a Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin (DRB) family in 1872 at Bilaspur in Central Provinces. He completed his Medical Degree from Grant Medical College in Mumbai in 1898, and was employed in Bombay Municipal Corporation as a Medical Officer. He left his job to participate in the Boer War in South Africa through the medical wing, as the King's Commissioned Officer, because of his keen interest in military life. He was also a Sanskrit scholar. 1907‚Äì1920: Career and Involvement with Bal Gangadhar Tilak Moonje was recognized as a freedom fighter and a strong supporter of Bal Gangadhar Tilak. In 1907, the Congress Party's annual session was held at Surat, where conflict arose between the \\"moderate\\" faction and the \\"extremist\\" faction, led by Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Bipinchandra Pal, over the selection of a new president. Due to Moonje's support of Tilak during the session, Tilak's trust in Moonje led to a strong relationship between the two. As a result, Moonje toured the entire Central India and collected funds for Tilak on many occasions. Moonje also introduced Ganesh and Shivaji Festivals in Central India and accompanied Tilak to Calcutta for this purpose. He was The General Secretary of Central Indian Provincial Congress for many years. The Bhonsala Military School in Nasik was established by him to provide military training to Hindus. All the institutions he founded are still running, some of them have completed their Diamond Jubilee. He also started a Marathi Newspaper known as Daily Maharashtra in Nagpur. Later life Following the death of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1920, Moonje dissociated from Congress. He disagreed with the two main policies of M. K. Gandhi, namely his non-violence and secularism. His association with Hindu Mahasabha increased and he was also political mentor of Dr Hedgewar who founded RSS in 1925. https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-rss-bhonsala-military-school-dhirendra- k-jha Moonje was the All India President of the Hindu Mahasabha from 1927 until he handed over the charge to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in 1937. Until his death, he was very active in the Mahasabha and toured all over India. Savarkar had his strong support. He also attended the Round Table Conferences (in London) twice, despite strong opposition from Congress leaders on his views. In 1931, Moonje travelled to Italy, where he met with Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Moonje also visited the Accademia della Farnesina and other military schools and educational institutions, and observed the Opera Nazionale Balilla, which he praised. Moonje, along with Savarkar, strongly advised Ambedkar to convert to any religion of Indian origin (and not any Abrahmic creed), when the question of Dalit exodus from Hinduism caught the imagination. Initially, Ambedkar thought of joining Sikhism but later settled for Buddhism.  Death and legacy  Moonje died in 1948.

Tania became a young neurosurgeon, though after her dissident father Andrei had been sent to Siberia, she adopted a costume and persona similar to the original Red Guardian's, and fought crime and protected dissidents in an attempt to reform Soviet society.

As a double bassist he was a founding member of the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra, and later a member of the National Symphony Orchestra of Cuba. A long-time member of the charanga Arca√±o y sus Maravillas, where he played cello and piano, he is considered the co-creator of the mambo, together with his brother Israel \\"Cachao\\" L√≥pez, and one of the most prolific danz√≥n composers of the 20th century.\\"Cuba recuerda a compositor y contrabajista Orestes L√≥pez\\", 2011. Biography=Early life and career Orestes L√≥pez was born in Old Havana on August 28, 1908, into a family of musicians. As a pre-teenager he studied piano, cello, violin and the five-key ebony flute. In 1924, at age 15, he became double bassist for the newly-founded Havana Philharmonic Orchestra directed by Pedro Sanju√°n. A few years later, he was playing bass for Miguel \\"El Moro\\" V√°zquez's charanga. According to his brother Cachao, in 1926 he was a member of Grupo Apolo, the first septeto to include a trumpet. Arca√±o y sus Maravillas Radio CMQ, c. 1945: Arca√±o on flute, Orestes L√≥pez on cello (seated), Cachao on bass. In the 1930s he was the musical director of three dance orchestras: L√≥pez-Barroso, Orquesta de Orestes L√≥pez and La Uni√≥n, before joining Antonio Arca√±o y sus Maravillas in 1937 as a founding member. L√≥pez, a multi-instrumentalist, composed and orchestrated danzones, most notably \\"Camina Juan Pescao\\", \\"El truco de Regatillo\\", \\"Los tres bailadores\\" and \\"Mambo\\", which launched a new style of danz√≥n, the so-called danz√≥n-mambo. Subsequently, the syncopated bass in the tune gave rise on the one hand to the dance genre known as mambo popularized by P√©rez Prado, and on the other hand to the cha-cha-ch√°, created by Enrique Jorr√≠n. In the late 1930s, the danz√≥n had three movements: the introduction, el paseo (the walk in a circle), and la comparsa (the main theme, in which dancers faced each other and danced). L√≥pez's danz√≥n-mambo, also called danz√≥n de nuevo ritmo, changed the third movement when he substituted a montuno (based on the syncopated beat of the son-playing treseros from Oriente). L√≥pez's montuno of two to four beats took on a special syncopated character and was given the generic name of mambo. Although the Maravillas disbanded in 1958, L√≥pez remained active in the popular music scene, playing piano in several of Cachao's descarga albums recorded between 1957 and 1960, including the successful Cuban Jam Sessions in Miniature. Later years and death His younger brother Cachao emigrated to Spain in 1961 and then to the USA in 1963, and achieved considerable success, but Orestes remained in Cuba. He died in Havana on January 26, 1991. In 2000, Orestes was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame, joining his brother, who had been inducted a year earlier. Orestes was survived by his son, Orlando \\"Cacha√≠to\\" L√≥pez (1933‚Äì2009) who was also a double bassist.

It is a part of the Tirhut Division. It was the capital city of the Vajjian Confederacy of (Vrijji mahajanapada), considered one of the first examples of a republic around the 6th century BCE. Gautama Buddha preached his last sermon before his death in c. 483 BCE, then in 383 BCE the Second Buddhist council was convened here by King Kalasoka, making it an important place in both Jain and Buddhist religions. It contains one of the best-preserved of the Pillars of Ashoka, topped by a single Asiatic lion (). The city finds mention in the travel accounts of Chinese explorers, Faxian (4th century CE) and Xuanzang (7th century CE), which were later used in 1861 by British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham to first identify Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ with the present village of Basarh in Vaishali District, Bihar. Etymology Vaishali derives its name from King Vishal of the Mahabharata age. Stupa at vaishali History The Vajji or Vrijji Mahajanapada, 600 BCE. Abhishek Pushkarini, the coronation tank, near Buddha Relic Stupa, Vaishali Even before the advent of Buddhism and Jainism, Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ was the capital of the republican Licchavi state.Vaishali ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Britannica In that period, Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ was an ancient metropolis and the capital city of the republic of the Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ state, which covered most of the Himalayan Gangetic region of present-day Bihar state, India. However, very little is known about the early history of Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´. The Vishnu Purana records 34 kings of Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´, the first being Nabhaga, who is believed to have abdicated his throne over a matter of human rights and believed to have declared: \\"I am now a free tiller of the soil, king over my acre.\\" The last among the 34 was Sumati, who is considered a contemporary of Dasaratha, father of the Hindu god, Lord Rama. Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ is also renowned as the land of Amrapali, the great Indian courtesan, who appears in many folktales, as well as in Buddhist literature. Ambapali became a disciple of Buddha. Manudev was a famous king of the illustrious Lichchavi clan of the confederacy, who desired to possess Amrapali after he saw her dance performance in Vaishali. A kilometer away is Abhishek Pushkarini, the coronation tank. The sacred waters of the tank anointed the elected representatives of Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´. Next to it stands the Japanese temple and the Vishwa Shanti Stupa (World Peace Pagoda) built by the Nipponzan Myohoji sect of Japan. A small part of the Buddha's relics found in Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ have been enshrined in the foundation and in the chhatra of the Stupa. Near the coronation tank is Stupa 1 or the Relic Stupa. Here the Lichchavis reverentially encased one of the eight portions of the Master's relics, which they received after the Mahaparinirvana. After his last discourse the Awakened One set out for Kushinagar, but the Licchavis kept following him. Buddha gave them his alms bowl but they still refused to return. The Master created an illusion of a river in spate which compelled them to go back. This site can be identified with Deora in modern Kesariya village, where Ashoka later built a stupa. ƒÄnanda, the favourite disciple of the Buddha, attained Nirvana in the midst of the Ganges outside Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´. Visits of the Buddha to Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ A Buddhist shrine amidst the Vihara, Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ Vaishali is well known for its close association with the Buddha. After leaving Kapilavastu for renunciation, he came to Vaishali first and had his spiritual training from Ramaputra Udraka and Alara Kalama (Alark Ram). After the Enlightenment the Buddha frequently visited Vaishali. He organized his Bhikshu Sangha on the pattern of Vaishalian democracy. It was here that he established the Bhikshuni Sangha, initiating his maternal aunt Maha Prajavati Gautami into the order. His last Varshavasa (rainy season resort) was here and he announced his approaching Mahaparinirvana (the final departure from the world) just three months in advance. Before leaving for Kusinagara, where he died, he left his alms-bowl (Bhiksha-Patra) here with the people of Vaishali. Jainism at Vaishali Prince Vardhaman (Lord Mahavira) used this seal after the Judgement The Svetambaras state that the final Tirthankara, Lord Mahavira, was born and raised in Kshatriyakund district, Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ to King Siddhartha. and Queen Trishala. According to Jain text UttarapurƒÅ·πáa, King Chetaka ruled as a Republican President in Vaishali and was a famous and complaisant king. He is mentioned as a staunch follower of Jainism. According to the text, Chetaka had ten sons and seven daughters. His sister Priyakarini (also known as Trishala) was married to Siddhartha. His daughter Chellana married Shrenik (also known as Bimbisara). As per Indologist Hermann Jacobi, Vardhaman Mahavira's mother Trishala was sister of King Chetaka. Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´ was also the residence of Kandaramasuka and PƒÅtikaputta.

Early military career Enlisting as an orderly sergeant, Howell served under Capt. Thomas H. Bates while stationed at an army battery in Utica, New York before his promotion to First Lieutenant. Wounded at the Battle of Fair Oaks, he returned home and later received an appointment as Captain of the 3rd Artillery and a staff officer under Gen. Henry Morris Naglee, later accompanying him to South Carolina. New York Draft Riots During the New York Draft Riots, he along with Captain Thaddeus P. Mott and General Charles C. Dodge of the 8th Regiment Artillery, were dispatched amid reports of an estimated 5,000 rioters being assembled near Eighth Avenue and 32nd Street. Although initially driving the mob back, the rioters armed with stones, brickbats and slung-shot counterattacked when Mott attempted to cut down three nearby African-Americans who had been hung nearby. Although ordered by Mott to bring two howitzers on the corner of 32nd Street and Seventh Avenue in order to sweep the streets with grape and canister, Howell was unable to make his way pass the large crowd and both the regiments infantry and cavalry were ordered to clear the way. With bayonets and sabres, the regiment charged toward the rioters causing the mob to split into two groups and driven back. Approaching the crowd alone, he ordered them to disperse threatening to fire upon them. However, while the rioters refused to disperse, they neither made any movement against the regiment causing the officers to hesitated in giving the order to fire. The rioters, believing the officers would not fire, charged moments later throwing stones and debris at the soldiers. After it was seen by the officers that the rioter's intentions were to seize the regiments guns, the order was given to fire against the charging crowd. Although many rioters were badly injured or killed in the first bombardment, the rioters in the rear continued fighting until another five of six rounds had been fired. Fleeing down various side streets, the regiment split into separate columns and chased after the retreating mob arresting many of the rioters before returning to their Mulberry Street headquarters. Two days following the attack, Howell rode his carriage to the area when he was attacked by seven or eight men who had recognized his uniform. Calling around to others nearby, soon a group of nearly fifty were shouting for Howell to be hanged. As the crowd began after the driver to stop the carriage, Howell drew his revolver and forced the driver to turn down 31st Street and had the driver use his lash to whip the horses into a full run. As the crowd followed after them, Howell's carriage was assaulted by a shower of stones and brick-bats breaking in many of the carriage's panels. At one point, the carriage was surrounded and one man managed to climb onto the carriage from behind, before he fell off and was run over. Although avoiding serious injury, Howell suffered temporary paralysis of his arm when a stone struck an old wound he had previously suffered. he finally managed to escape after firing his revolver at the crowd from the back window. Later years Howell later assumed command the 3rd Battery and remained at Newbern, North Carolina until late 1863 when it moved to Norfolk and then took part in the Carratuck campaign, being stationed at Great Bridge. The battery was eventually organized with the Army of the James, and was in the advance during all its movements before being The Battery was re-organized as a veteran organization on January 1, 1864.

It was built but never flew. Development The Tramp was a development of Bristol's earlier Pullman passenger aircraft. In 1919, Frank Barnwell entered discussions with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company about the feasibility of using flying boats as auxiliaries to ocean liners. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company had very limited experience with internal combustion engines, but long-term and deep knowledge of steam turbine powerplants, and so suggested the use of a steam turbine to power the aircraft. As Bristol's heavy bomber, the Braemar ‚Äì the progenitor of the Pullman ‚Äì had originally been designed to have a central engine room with driveshafts to wing-mounted propellors, the Pullman seemed a suitable candidate as a testbed for the installation of a steam turbine engine room. The powerplant was to consist of two 1,500 hp (1,120 kW) steam turbines of the Ljungstr√∏m type, with closed-circuit high-pressure flash boilers. The unprecedented 3,000 hp (2,240 kW) would be delivered though driveshafts and clutches to four-bladed tractor propellers mounted on each middle wing (the Braemar/Pullman/Tramp family were triplanes). In the end, the only problem encountered with the steam turbine itself was that it delivered far too much power for the Tramp airframe, which had been designed to handle the 1,600 hp (1,190 kW) of four 400 hp (300 kW) Liberty L-12 engines. The main problem turned out to be designing a reliable lightweight closed-circuit boiler and condenser. Two examples of the Tramp were completed in 1921, powered by four 230 hp (170 kW) Siddeley Puma piston engines, but the power transmission system, particularly the clutches, gave continual trouble, and neither ever flew. They were moved to Farnborough in 1922 where they were used as ground test rigs for several years. The Tramp Boat was a proposed flying boat development of the Tramp.

Adapted from a novelette by Fan Yiping, the film revolves around a small-town policeman who embarks on a search for his missing gun. The film also explores the themes of self-identity and self-respect, as well as addresses a number of pertinent social issues, such as counterfeits, in China. Plot War veteran turned small-town policeman Ma Shan (played by Jiang Wen) wakes up after a drunken night at his sister's wedding banquet to find his issued gun missing. After making sure his wife Han Xiaoyun (Wu Yujuan) and third-grader son have not taken it, Ma embarks on a search around the town. He questions his sister and brother-in- law, as well as two ex-comrades in an attempt to connect the dots. He finds out that he was sent home the previous night in a car by Zhou Xiaogang (Shi Liang). Ma knocks on Zhou's door but is greeted by Li Xiaomeng (Ning Jing), Ma's former lover who married and moved to Guangzhou, but has since returned. Li claims that Zhou is not home. Ma leaves but manages to run into Zhou a moment later. After searching Zhou's car, he ascertains that Zhou has not taken his gun either. Ma is left with no choice but to report the missing gun to his superiors. He is stripped of his uniform but is allowed to continue the search on his own. During his search, Ma comes across a thief who has snatched a woman's handbag and gives chase. The desperate thief, seeing no escape, pulls out a gun. Mistaking the gun for his own, Ma refuses to back down. The thief fires, only to reveal that the gun he holds is a fake. Meanwhile, a murder has taken place in town. A man has sneaked into Zhou's home and shoots Li with the missing gun. Upon interrogation, Zhou insists that he was not the intended target. However, Ma investigates on his own and reveals that Zhou runs an underground factory which produces counterfeit wine. Ma then retains Zhou, exchanges clothes with him, and boards a bus heading out of town. True to his prediction, the criminal trails Ma, thinking that he is Zhou, shoots him from behind at the railway station but fails to kill him instantly. As the criminal approaches to confirm his kill, Ma turns over and locks the two of them together with his handcuffs. The criminal turns out to be Stammer Liu, a local bricklayer whose family was poisoned from drinking Zhou's illicit wine. Liu begs Ma to let him go to avenge his family but Ma refuses. Ma then draws out the fake gun he confiscated from the thief and Liu, in fear, fires and spends the last bullet. Ma bleeds profusely and feels faint, lying on the ground. The police arrive, and as they rush over to apprehend Liu, Ma‚Äîor his hallucination‚Äîis shown to suddenly stand up and walk away with his recovered gun, apparently unhurt and laughing (or perhaps crying) at finding his lost weapon.

Personal life Aln√¶s was born in Fredrikstad, as the son of headmaster Johannes J√∏rgen Lauritz Aln√¶s (1835‚Äì1916) and Elise Martine Hansen (1851‚Äì1931). He married Emilie Thorne (1882‚Äì1976) in 1903. He was the father of author Lise B√∏rsum, and grandfather of novelist Finn Aln√¶s and artist Bente B√∏rsum. Career In 1888 he was enrolled at the Music and Organist School in Oslo (Musikkonservatoriet i Oslo). Aln√¶s studied piano with Westye Waaler, organ with Peter Brynie Lindeman as well as harmony, counterpoint and composition with Iver Holter. In April 1892, after Aln√¶s had finished his studies in Oslo, he studied in Leipzig with Carl Reinecke and, after the premi√®re of his first symphony in 1896, in Berlin with Julius Ruthardt. For many year, he played the organ in several churches and conducted choirs. During the years 1895-1907 he was organist at Bragernes Church in Drammen. From 1907-16 he was at Uranienborg Church in Oslo and between 1916-32 at Oslo Cathedral. He helped found the Norwegian Composer's Union (Norsk Komponistforening) in 1917 and served as chairman from 1921-23. Aln√¶s wrote music in a late Romantic style; his output included two symphonies, one set of symphonic variations, a piano concerto, pieces for piano, chorale preludes for organ, choral works, and art songs (in Norwegian, romanser). Discography A number of songs by Aln√¶s have been recorded by the likes of Kirsten Flagstad and Feodor Chaliapin. In 2007 the first recording of Aln√¶s's Piano Concerto in D major, Op. 27 (published c. 1919)see Hofmeisters Monatsbericht, 1919, p.78 was released; it featured Piers Lane as the piano soloist and the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Andrew Litton. In early 2010 the premiere recording of his two symphonies - no.1 in C minor, Op.7 and no.2 in D major, Op.43 - was released, with the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Terje Mikkelsen. Aln√¶s received the King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) in gold in 1922, and in 1932 was appointed a Knight 1st Class in the Order of St. Olav. He died in 1932 and was buried at Vestre gravlund cemetery in the Frogner borough of Oslo.

He did much literary work in connection with this society. From 1882 to 1902 he was director of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and in 1893 was chairman of the committee on retrospective American art at the World's Columbian Exposition.

The episode tells of the love between the mortal Acis and the Nereid (sea-nymph) Galatea; when the jealous Cyclops Polyphemus kills Acis, Galatea transforms her lover into an immortal river spirit. The episode was made the subject of poems, operas, paintings, and statues in the Renaissance and after. Mythology Galatea (ŒìŒ±ŒªŒ¨œÑŒµŒπŒ±; \\"she who is milk- white\\"), daughter of Nereus and Doris, was a sea-nymph anciently attested in the work of both Homer and Hesiod, where she is described as the fairest and most beloved of the 50 Nereids.Hesiod, Theogony; Homer, Iliad. In Ovid's Metamorphoses she appears as the beloved of Acis, the son of Faunus and the river-nymph Symaethis, daughter of the River Symaethus. When a jealous rival, the Sicilian Cyclops Polyphemus, killed him with a boulder, Galatea then turned his blood into the Sicilian River Acis, of which he became the spirit.Ovid, Metamorphoses xiii.750-68. This version of the tale now occurs nowhere earlier than in Ovid's work and might perhaps have been a fiction invented by the poet, \\"suggested by the manner in which the little river springs forth from under a rock\\". But according to the Greek scholar Athenaeus, the story was first concocted by Philoxenus of Cythera as a political satire against the Sicilian tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse, whose favourite concubine, Galatea, shared her name with the nymph.Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 1.6e Others claim that the story was invented to explain the presence of a shrine dedicated to Galatea on Mount Etna.Scholiast on Theocritus' Idyll VI quoting the historian Duris and the poet Philoxenus of Cythera Cultural references An 1822 French Empire mantel clock depicting Galatea. The design on its frieze is based on Rafael's fresco Literary and operatic During Renaissance and Baroque times the story emerged once more as a popular theme. In Spain, Luis de G√≥ngora y Argote wrote the much-admired narrative poem, F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea, published in 1627. It is particularly noted for its depiction of landscape and for the sensual description of the love of Acis and Galatea. It was written in homage to an earlier and rather shorter narrative with the same title by Luis Carillo y Sotomayor (1611) The story was also given operatic treatment in the very popular zarzuela of Antoni Lliteres Carri√≥ (1708). The atmosphere here is lighter and enlivened by the inclusion of the clowns Momo and Tisbe. In France, Jean-Baptiste Lully devoted his opera Acis et Galat√©e (1686) to their love. Described by him as a pastoral-heroic work, it depicts a love triangle between the three main characters - Acis, Galatea, and Poliph√®me. Poliph√®me murders Acis out of jealousy, but Acis is revived and turned into a river by Neptune. In Italy Giovanni Bononcini's one-act opera Polifemo followed in 1703. Shortly afterwards George Frideric Handel was working in that country and composed the cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo (1708), laying as much emphasis on the part of Polifemo as on the lovers. Written in Italian, Polifemo's deep bass solo Fra l'ombre e gl'orrori (From horrid shades) establishes his character from the start. After Handel's move to England, he gave the story a new treatment in his pastoral opera Acis and Galatea with an English libretto provided by John Gay.The text is on the Stanford University site and there is a complete performance on YouTube Initially composed in 1718, the work went through many revisions and was later to be given updated orchestrations by both Mozart and Mendelssohn. As a pastoral work where Polyphemus plays only a minor, though decisive part, it largely centres on the two lovers. While staying in London, Nicola Porpora composed the opera Polifemo which features Acis and Galatea as well as the former's encounter with Polyphemus. In Austria later in the century, Joseph Haydn composed Acide e Galatea (1763).Brief excerpts at Classical Archives Designed for an imperial wedding, it was given a happier ending centred on the transformation scene after the murder of Acis as the pair declare their undying love.Rebecca Green, \\"Representing the Aristocracy\\", in Haydn and his world, Princeton University 1997, pp.167-8 Painting File:√âdouard Zier - Acis et Galath√©e se cachant de Polyph√®me.jpgAcis and Galatea hiding from Polyphemus by √âdouard Zier (1877) File:Acis LACMA M.88.91.382m.jpgAcis by Philip Galle (1586) File:Atis and Galathea (Pompeo Batoni) - Nationalmuseum - 23711.tifAtis and Galathea by Pompeo Batoni (1761) File:Nicolas Poussin - Acis et Galat√©e.jpgAcis and Galatea by Nicolas Poussin (circa 1629-1630) Beaux-Arts de Carcassonne - Acis et Galath√©e - Nicolas Bertin Joconde04400000589.jpgAcis and Galatea by Nicolas Bertin File:Acis und Galatea (van Schuppen).jpgAcis und Galatea by Jacob van Schuppen (circa 1730) File:Fran√ßois Perrier - Acis, Galatea, and Polyphemus - WGA17206.jpgAcis, Galatea, and Polyphemus by Fran√ßois Perrier (1645 and 1650) File:Claude Lorrain 001.jpgCoastal landscape with Acis and Galatea by Claude Lorrain (1657) File:Michel corneille acis et galat√©e.JPGAcis and Galatea by Michel Corneille File:Nicolas Poussin - Paysage avec Polyph√®me.jpgLandscape with Polyphemus by Nicolas Poussin Paintings featuring Acis and Galatea can be grouped according to their themes. Most notably the story takes place within a pastoral landscape in which the figures are almost incidental. This is particularly so in Nicolas Poussin's Landscape with Polyphemus (1649)(Hermitage Museum) and Claude Lorrain's seaside landscape (Dresden) of 1657, in both of which the lovers play a minor part in the foreground. In an earlier painting by Poussin (National Gallery of Ireland, 1630) the couple is among several embracing figures in the foreground, shielded from view of Polyphemus, who is playing his flute higher up the slope. In all of these Polyphemus is somewhere in the background, but many others feature Galatea alone, as in Perino del Vaga's painting of her being drawn by sea beasts over the waves while riding on a seashell.http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yKTcOgwlx0U/TxqpsTcifiI/AAAAAAAALN4/D5PDymRH16k/s1600/Galatea.jpg Generally, though, the nymph is carried through the sea by adoring attendants in paintings generally titled The Triumph of Galatea, of which the most renowned treatment is by Raphael. In general these follow the 3rd-century description given of such a painting by Philostratus the Younger in his Imagines:2.18, translation by Arthur Fairbanks, (Loeb 1931) In those cases where the rejected lover Polyphemus appears somewhere ashore, the division between them is emphasised by their being identified with their respective elements, sea, and land. Typical examples of this were painted by Francois Perrier,http://www.wga.hu/art/p/perrier/acisgala.jpg Giovanni Lanfranco and Jean-Baptiste van Loo. Sensual portrayals of the lovers embracing in a landscape were provided by French painters especially, as in those by Charles de La Fosse (c. 1700), Jean-Fran√ßois de Troy and Alexandre Charles Guillemot (1827). Polyphemus lurks in the background of these and in the example by De Troy his presence plainly distresses Galatea. Other French examples by Antoine Jean Gros (1833) and √âdouard Zier (1877) show the lovers hiding in a cave and peering anxiously out at him. They anticipate the tragic moment when he looms menacingly over the pair, having discovered the truth they have tried to conceal. The threat is as apparent in Jean-Francois de Troy's softly outlined 18th-century vision as it is in Odilon Redon's almost Surrealist painting of 1900. The brooding atmosphere in these suggests the violent action which is to follow. That had been portrayed in earlier paintings of Polyphemus casting a rock at the fleeing lovers, such as those by Annibale Carracci,http://www.wga.hu/art/c/carracci/annibale/farnese/farnese4.jpg and Carle van Loo.

There is a fanciful description of a fountain that incorporates them both in John Barclay's Latin novel Argenis, dating from 1621: An actual statue by a pool in the public gardens of Acireale, the Sicilian town where the transformation of Acis is supposed to have taken place, is less ingenious. He lies beneath the boulder that has killed him while Galatea crouches to one side, an arm raised to heaven in supplication.http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kThEbQGMmBk/TzGUDIvSurI/AAAAAAABC0g/I-28O8ANL4I/s1600/Marble+statue+in+the+garden+publics+of+Acireale,+Sicily+-+Tutt%27Art@.jpgtitle=-kThEbQGMmBk/TzGUDIvSurI/AAAAAAABC0g/I-28O8ANL4I/s1600/Marble+statue+in+the+garden+publics+of+Acireale,+Sicily+-+Tutt%27Art@ French sculptors have also been responsible for some memorable statues. There are a pair by Jean-Baptiste Tuby in the Bosquet des D√¥mes in the Versailles gardens. Acis leans on a rock, casually playing the flute, as the half-clad Galatea comes upon him with hands lifted in surprise (1667‚Äì75). A similar gesture is displayed in the statue of her alone in the fountain to the right of the great staircase at Ch√¢teau de Chantilly. The lovers are portrayed together as part of the Medici Fountain in the Luxembourg Garden in Paris. Designed by Auguste Ottin in 1866, the marble group embrace inside a grotto while above them is crouched a huge Polyphemus in weathered bronze, peering down in jealousy. Many other statues feature Galatea alone, but there is a complication. Some time after the Renaissance, the same name was given to Pygmalion's animated statue and one has to distinguish between representations of her and of the nymph Galatea. One pointer is given by the introduction of features mentioned in the description of the nymph by Philostratus that is quoted above. These include one hand raised and holding a billowing scarf; sea imagery, including shells, dolphins and tritons; and often the fact that the statue is incorporated into a fountain. In the work by Gabriel de Grupello in the castle park at Schwetzingen, the triton at Galatea's feet holds up a garland threaded with shells and pearls. The Galatea in the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo in Russia has sea pearls threaded into her hair. There is also a statue of her by Nicola Michetti that forms part of the cascade at the Peterhof Palace in St Petersburg. The nymph reclines on a large shell carried by tritons in the 18th-century fountain at the Villa Borromeo Visconti Litta in Milan. It is on the back of a dolphin that she reclines in the statue by the 19th-century Italian sculptor Leopoldo Ansiglioni (1832‚Äì1894). There are two versions of this, one at the centre of a fish pool in the East House of the University of Greenwich's Winter Gardens, and a later copy installed at Hearst Castle in California. In this, one of the arms bent back to support her head is encircled by the dolphin's tail. There is also a German fountain by Karl Friedrich Moest now installed in Karlsruhe in which Galatea sits on the back of a triton. Over her head she balances the huge shell from which the water pours. Another statue was erected at the head of an impressive cascade in Stuttgart's Eugenplatz. A work of Otto Rieth (1858‚Äì1911) dating from 1890, it features the nymph crowned with seaweed and surging up from the dolphin and young cupids playing at her feet. In the applied arts, three-dimensional representations of Raphael's triumph theme were often incorporated into artifacts for aristocratic use and were painted on majolica ware.

Founded as the Players Club by Agnes Jeffrey Shedd in 1923, the company originated as a private club for local theatre enthusiasts. Over the course of 70 years, the organization evolved into a public community theatre, and finally into a professional resident theatre under contract to Actors' Equity. In 1989, the company moved its operations into the Vern Riffe Center for Government and the Arts, having formerly occupied the Davis Discovery Center on Franklin Avenue. Players Theatre abruptly folded on September 11, 1993, just days before they were to open their 70th season. At the time, Players was the only professional theatre company in Columbus, as well as the city's oldest non-profit arts institution in continuous operation. An official report cited a range of systemic problems within the organization including \\"mismanagement, inaccurate and incomplete internal reports, continuing cash-flow crises, lack of cost and auditing controls, and unrealistic budgets and income projections.\\" At the time of Players' closing, executive staff consisted of Artistic Director Ed Graczyk, Associate Artistic Director Steven C. Anderson, Managing Director Jean Ann Klaus, and President of the Board of Directors Thomas Murrill. Anderson, in charge of Players' youth theatre program, went on to found the Phoenix Theatre for Children and currently serves as the artistic director of CATCO.

It originally aired on September 26, 2005. The episode was written by Carter Bays & Craig Thomas and it was directed by Pamela Fryman. Ted throwing multiple parties hoping that Robin will attend is reminiscent of The Great Gatsby.  Plot  Future Ted quickly recaps the time he met Robin and accidentally told her that he loved her. A week has gone by since that incident, and Ted and Marshall find Robin in MacLaren's talking with Lily. After Robin leaves, Lily lets slip that Robin told Lily that she was interested in Ted, but she's looking for something \\"casual\\" and he is not. Ted decides to try to be casual in his pursuit of Robin. On Friday afternoon, Ted sees Robin on the news covering a kid stuck inside a crane machine at a bodega nearby, and sprints over to meet Robin. When Robin sees him, he casually says that he's buying dip for a party they're hosting and invites Robin as well. This puts Marshall in a bind, as he has a 25-page paper on constitutional law due on Monday that he hasn't even started (and he must also contend with Lily who is so happy to be engaged that she is always in the mood for love), but he gamely goes ahead with the party. Barney, meanwhile, tries to convince Ted to pick up a random girl at the party. Ted declines, so Barney finds said random girl and hooks up with her himself. In the end, Robin doesn't show up. Ted impulsively tells Robin that the party will continue Saturday night as well, putting Marshall further behind the eight ball and subjecting Barney to a reunion with his random hook-up. Barney gets rid of her by telling her he's in love with her, as Ted did with Robin. Once again, Robin fails to come to the party, and on Sunday morning, Ted tells her the party will continue that night as well. The party on Sunday is sparsely attended, and Marshall loses his temper when his law book, which he needs for his paper that is now due the next morning, is used as a coaster. He angrily lashes out at Ted for throwing three parties for Robin, realizing too late that she is present this time. Ted covers by lying to Robin and telling her that he wanted her to meet another guy, Carlos (who had been mentioned but who none of the main characters knew). After a time, Ted talks to Robin on the roof, and Robin is able to recognise his true feelings. In an attempt to prove to her that he doesn't necessary have the feelings, he kisses her, but he realises he does have those feelings and can't take them away. Robin suggests that they can be friends. Ted isn't sure because he's worried things might become awkward between them, but he comes around and takes Robin to formally meet his friends. They go for a drink with the gang, where Robin fits perfectly in the group - by mocking Barney's jealousy and inability to get a date for the night while Carlos is making out with the random hook-up. Marshall announces he will drink two beers, go upstairs, write a 25-page paper, and get an 'A'; Future Ted tells his children that, in fact, Marshall got a B- on the paper, still impressive considering he wrote it all in one night. While helping Ted get another round of drinks, Robin reminds Ted that he's a good catch and he'll make some girl very happy, and offers to help him find \\"the one\\".

The basis of the invitation system is that a member can grant approval to a new user without having to consult any other members. Existing members may receive a set number of invitations (sometimes in the form of tokens) to allow others to join the service. Those invited to a website are typically sent either a specialized URL or a single-use pass code.  Applications  Invitation systems for websites are usually temporary. They are typically used for services in private beta testing, in order to control the number of users on the service. In other cases, they can be used due to limited availability of server resources. There are a growing number of sites which use invitation systems on a permanent basis to create exclusivity and to control quality of user-generated content.SpeakUp - \\"Ffffantastic Bookmarking.\\" Published 17 October 2007. Retrieved 20 October 2009. Rarely, they may be used on a permanent basis in order to aggregate social network statistics (all users will ultimately have a traceable connection to all others). They are sometimes used to avoid abusive types or spammers, by relying on mutual trust between all members.  Variations  Sometimes, a tiered invitation system may be in place, wherein those higher up the hierarchy will have the power to grant more invitations, whereas low-ranking members may receive few or even no invitation rights.  Examples  Some prominent services which were once invitation-based include blog-host LiveJournal, social network Yahoo 360¬∞, and podcast publisher Odeo. When Google releases new services, an invitation requirement has often been imposed for the first few months of the service's existence, including e-mail provider Gmail, social networking service Orkut and real-time collaboration site Google Wave. Many BitTorrent trackers, known as \\"private trackers\\", use an invitation system in order to maintain torrent quality, speeds, and safety. Demonoid and ImmortalSeed are examples of invitation-only trackers. Despite its invitation- only status, Oink's Pink Palace was accessed by government authorities and forced to close in October 2007. Several actors in the Video game industry are also using this approach.

One primary focus of the book is a history of British English, from its Old English beginnings to Middle English, Early Modern English, and Modern English. Crystal also argues eloquently for the inclusion of dialects and \\"non-standard\\" varieties of English. Even for the Old English period, he shows how the available evidence can be used to determine what dialectal variation existed. Finally, Crystal condemns what he sees as the over-abundance of linguistic prescription in the study of English, especially that which existed from the 18th Century to the 20th. He speaks approvingly of the recent shift of focus in English language education away from prescriptivism.

History  The Kinder goat breed began in the late summer of 1985, when Zederkamm Farm's Nubian buck died, leaving two Nubian does without a mate. Since they also kept pygmy goats and did not want to take the does to another farm to be bred, they were bred with their pygmy buck. Left to his own devices, the buck accomplished the two successful breedings, making use of log sections and sloping land to reach the correct height. On 30 June and 4 July 1986, the first three Kinder does were born (Zederkamm Briar Rose, Zederkamm Liberty, and Zederkamm Tia). It was another year before the first Kinder buck was born (Zederkamm Napoleon).  Breed characteristics  Kinder does weigh about or so, and bucks a little more - . The maximum height at the withers of a Kinder is for does and for bucks, and the minimum is . Unlike many breeds, Kinder goats are aseasonal breeders, meaning they can be bred throughout the year; this trait is inherited from their pygmy ancestors.

The track offers view over Lake Rotoiti and St Arnaud. The treeline on the northeastern slopes of Mt Robert is unusually low due to erosion following the loss of the original beech forest by fire in 1887 and subsequent grazing. Mature beech forest remains on the western and southern sides of the mountain. On its northern side is an abandoned skifield.

IQ and Global Inequality. Washington Summit Publishers: Augusta, GA. IQ and Global Inequality is follow-up to their 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations,Lynn, R. and Vanhanen, T. (2002). IQ and the wealth of nations. Westport, CT: Praeger. an expansion of the argument that international differences in current economic development are due in part to differences in average national intelligence as indicated by national IQ estimates, and a response to critics. The book was published by Washington Summit Publishers, a white nationalist publisher. Lynn and Vanhanen's research on national IQs has attracted widespread criticism of the book's scores, methodology, and conclusions.  Summary  In IQ and Global Inequality Lynn and Vanhanen argue that intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, is a major contributor to national wealth as well as to various measures of social well-being. They base this argument on the finding that nations' average IQs have a strong correlation with several such factors, among them adult literacy (0.64), tertiary education (0.75), life expectancy (0.77), and democratization (0.57). The book is a follow-up to Lynn and Vanhanen's 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and expands on many of the ideas presented in their earlier book. IQ and Global Inequality responds to some of the criticisms directed against the earlier book. To address the criticism that measures of national IQ are unreliable, for 71 nations they measure national IQs using two different methods, and find that the correlation between different measures of national IQ is 0.95. As a further argument for reliability, they find that their reported national IQs are correlated with various measures of math and science achievement, with correlations ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Finally, the book presents the authors' theory as to the cause of national IQs. They propose a model of gene-environment interaction in which high IQ leads to better nutrition, education and health care, further enhancing IQ. They also propose that the racial composition of countries is an important factor in national IQs. They base this conclusion on the observation that national IQs can generally be predicted from the countries' racial composition, and that national IQs of racially similar countries tend to cluster together.  National IQ and QHC values  Lynn and Vanhanen base their analysis on selected IQ data from studies which covered 113 nations. For another 79 nations, they estimated the mean IQs on the basis of the arithmetic means of the measured IQs of neighboring countries. They justify this method of estimation by claiming that the correlation between the estimated national IQs they reported in IQ and the Wealth of Nations and the measured national IQs since obtained is very high (0.91). Lynn and Vanhanen calculated the national IQs in relation to a British mean of 100, with a standard deviation of 15. They adjusted all test results to account for the Flynn effect: adjustments were 2 points per decade for Raven's Progressive Matrices and 3 points per decade for all other types of tests. When two IQ studies were used from one country, their mean was calculated, whereas when three or more were available, the median was used. Reception Academic reviews of the book generally criticized both its methodology and conclusions. The methods of the study were criticized by Richard E. Nisbett for relying on small and haphazard samples and for ignoring data that did not support the conclusions.Nisbett, Richard. 2009. Intelligence and how to get it. pp. 215. University of Reading geographer Stephen Morse also criticized the book (as well as IQ and the Wealth of Nations), arguing that the authors' hypothesis rests on \\"serious flaws\\". Morse also argued: \\"The central dilemma of the Lynn and Vanhanen case rests with their assumption that national IQ data are primarily (not wholly) a function of innate ability, which in turn is at least partly generated by genes. There are many assumptions of cause‚Äìeffect in here, and some of them involve substantial leaps of faith.\\" Psychologist J. Philippe Rushton, president of the Pioneer Fund that has been a long time funder of research by Lynn,Grantees Lynn & Vanhanen 2002 p.2 reviewed the book in 2006 for Personality and Individual Differences. Rushton wrote that the book extends and answers criticisms against the earlier work in several ways, and believed that the methods were accurate. Evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa claimed in 2008 to have found support for Lynn's theories. Kanazawa's study has been criticized for using the Pythagorean theorem to estimate geographic distance, despite the fact that this theorem only applies to flat surfaces and the Earth's surface is roughly spherical. Other problems identified in this study include that Kanazawa incorrectly assumed that individuals migrated from Africa to other continents migrated as the crow flies, and ignored that geographic distance and evolutionary novelty do not always correspond to each other. In an article published in the European Journal of Personality, Heiner Rindermann compared the IQ scores from the book to a large number of international student assessment studies on subjects such as reading, mathematics, science, and problem solving, and found them to be highly intercorrelated. Statistical analyses indicated that the results could be explained by an underlying general cognitive ability. More than 30 commentaries on Rindermann's findings were published in the same issue of the journal. In a 2008 study published in the journal Intelligence, Garry Gelade reported a strong relationship between the book's national IQ estimates and the country's geographical location. On this basis, he concluded that book's findings were \\"defensible\\". In the 2010 paper \\"A systematic literature review of the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans\\", also published in Intelligence, Jelte M. Wicherts and colleagues stated: Lynn and Gerhard Meisenberg replied that \\"critical evaluation of the studies presented by WDM shows that many of these are based on unrepresentative elite samples\\" and that a further literature review, including taking into account results in mathematics, science, and reading, gave \\"an IQ of 68 as the best reading of the IQ in sub- Saharan Africa\\". Wicherts and colleagues in yet another reply stated: \\"In light of all the available IQ data of over 37,000 African testtakers, only the use of unsystematic methods to exclude the vast majority of data could result in a mean IQ close to 70. On the basis of sound methods, the average IQ remains close to 80. Although this mean IQ is clearly lower than 100, we view it as unsurprising in light of the potential of the Flynn effect in Africa (Wicherts, Borsboom, & Dolan, 2010) and common psychometric problems associated with the use of western IQ tests among Africans.\\" Consequently, some later studies using average national IQ data have checked their results against both data sets. Economists Jones and Schneider, commenting for Economic Inquiry said that the books appropriately summarized the previous volume's findings. Earl Hunt cited Lynn and Vanhanen's work as an example of scientists going far beyond the empirical support to make controversial policy recommendations, and as such as examples of irresponsible uses of science. Hunt argues that in their argumentation they both made the basic mistake of assigning causality to a correlation without evidence, and that they made \\"staggeringly low\\" estimates of Sub-Saharan African IQs based on highly problematic data. He considers that by their negligence of observing good scientific practice Lynn and Vanhanen are not living up to the basic responsibility of scientists to make sure that their results can function as reasonable empirical support for policy decisions.

Deir El Bersha () is a Coptic village in Middle Egypt. It is located on the east bank of the Nile in the Minya Governorate, to the south of Antino√∂polis and almost opposite the city of Mallawi. Overview During the Middle Kingdom it was the chief cemetery of the governors (\\"nomarchs\\") of the 15th Upper Egyptian Nome, dating back to the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties. The most spectacular of the tombs is that of the Great Overlord of the Hare (15th) Nome called Djehutihotep. He lived during the reigns of Amenemhat II, Senusret II and Senusret III. Deir El Bersha necropolis is near the Nile valley town of Minya, 225 km south of Cairo.  Excavations  In the spring of 1915, the Harvard University-Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, expedition dug at Bersha. They excavated a tomb (designated number 10A) that belonged to an early Middle Kingdom nomarch named Djehutynakht. The tomb had been looted, but an enormous collection of wooden models representing scenes of daily life and boats remained. The tomb also contained the extraordinary painted coffins of Djehutynakht and his wife. The grave goods are now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 2007, the tomb of an Egyptian courtier was found. The tomb belonged to Henu, an estate manager and high-ranking official during the First Intermediate Period, which lasted from 2181 to 2050 BC and was a time of political chaos in ancient Egypt. The archaeologists found Henu's mummy wrapped in linen in a large wooden coffin and a sarcophagus decorated with hieroglyphic texts addressed to the gods Anubis and Osiris. The tomb contained well-preserved painted wooden statuettes of workers making bricks, women making beer and pounding cereal, and a model of a boat with rowers, Egyptian media said. (from a 2007-05-21 news article at www.chinaview.cn ) In 2019, archaeologists revealed a 4000-year-old ancient Egyptian 'map for the soul' on two wooden panels with a mix of ancient hieroglyphs and symbols inside a sarcophagus known as the Coffin Texts at Deir El Bersha.

Distribution This herbaceous perennial plant is native to the Northwestern United States, California, and Nevada, including in the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains regions; and to Western Canada, including in the Canadian Rockies. Habitats it is found in include yellow pine forest, northern juniper woodland, lowland to higher elevation meadows, and wetland-riparian zones; from in elevation. Description Geranium viscosissimum is a large, clumped tall perennial wild geranium. The stem, leaves, and flower stalks are covered with sticky hairs. The right-green leaves are dissected, many-toothed, and deeply-lobed. Its bloom period is April to September, depending on elevation and latitude. It has saucer-shaped pink flowers with reddish-purple lines on the petals. They occur in an open cluster near the top of strong, branching flower stalks. Carnivorous syndrome In his 1999 journal article, G.G. Spomer tested several plants in the Pacific Northwest for the carnivorous syndrome, using the digestion of proteins as the diagnostic tool to determine which plants appeared to produce protease enzymes capable of breaking down potential prey. Geranium viscosissimum displayed a capability to digest and absorb the 14C-labeled algal protein placed on the sticky trichomes that the plant possesses. However, it is not known whether the digestive enzymes were produced by the plant itself or surface microbes.Spomer, G.G. (1999). Evidence of protocarnivorous capabilities in Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta and other sticky plants. International Journal of Plant Sciences, 160(1): 98-101. Additionally, some definitions of carnivory require the plant to gain some tangible benefit in capturing and digesting prey, such as increased seed yield or growth. Such an experiment has not been done with this species. Uses The flowers and leaves of this species are edible, but reported to be astringent. Flowers can be added to salads or used as a garnish.PFAF.org: Geranium viscosissimum Medicinal Blackfeet Indians used an infusion from this plant to treat diarrhea and gastric upset and urinary irritations.

It is thought that Pine gave lessons to Prince Demah in London. Around 1784, Pine travelled to America and settled in Philadelphia, where his time was completely taken up with portraiture. Among his sitters were General Gates, Charles Carroll, Robert Morris, George Read, Thomas Stone, Mrs. Reid (Metropolitan Museum, New York), and Washington (1785). The portrait of Washington was engraved for Irving's Life of Washington, but it is weak in characterization. An historically interesting canvas Congress Voting Independence, now in the Historical Society, Philadelphia, was begun by Pine and finished by Edward Savage. After Pine's death many of his pictures were collected in the Columbian Museum in Boston.

He was an ally of the Republic of Genoa and enemy of Pisa. He was a son of Comita III (by his wife Ispella of Arborea), who associated him with the government of Logudoro as early as 1203. He succeeded his father in 1218. Mariane was half-brother of Hugh I of Arborea. His sister Maria was in 1202 married to Boniface, the heir of the Marquess of Saluzzo; their son Manfred became the third marquess. Marianus' sister Iurgia (Giorgia) was in 1210 married to Emanuele Doria, heir of the Genovese fortress in Logudorese coast. Around 1200, Comita III came to terms with William I of Cagliari and Ubaldo I Visconti, promising to marry his son Marianus to William's daughter Agnes. By a pact signed November 1218 with Lambert of Gallura, Marianus secured the marriage of his daughter Adelasia to Lambert's son Ubaldo. The marriage was celebrated in 1219. Pope Honorius III, enemy of the Pisans, immediately sent his chaplain Bartolomeo to annul the marriage, but he failed and the pact between Pisa and Logudoro stood. Honorius nevertheless urged Milan to aid Marianus in any opposition to Pisa. In 1228, Peter II of Arborea allied with the Visconti of Gallura. He was consequently attacked by Marianus in concert with William II of Cagliari. They desired to maintain a condominium in Arborea, but internal fighting allowed Peter to solidify his authority with little opposition. From 1230 to 1232, Marianus exercised the regency of Cagliari on behalf of the young William II and in right of his wife Agnes. He died in 1233 and, by his will, was succeeded by his son Barison III. Upon Barison's death (1236) without heirs, the Logudorese magnates, as specified by Marianus' will, elected one of his daughters Adelasia or Benedetta (who is thought to have married the Catalan Count of Empuries) to inherit. They unanimously acclaimed Adelasia, whose husband could well uphold her right. So they in turn elected him judge as well. Sources *Ghisalberti, Alberto M.

It was formerly included with the typical cinquefoils in the genus Potentilla. Description The leaves are pinnately compound with an uneven number of leaflets, most commonly 7 to 11. Most leaves are found in a rosette at the base of the plant, but there are some leaves arranged alternately along the flowering stem. Leaves are densely covered in short and somewhat sticky hairs (trichomes). The flowers are arranged in a tight cluster (cyme) on a long stem from tall. They are strawberry-like, with five white or cream petals, five pointed green sepals between the petals, and a round head of pistils in the center with more than 20 stamens in a ring around it. Nectar is secreted from a ring below the pistils. The flowers are small and the nectar and pollen are easy for short-tongued insects to reach. Small short-tongued bees visit the flowers to gather or feed on pollen and nectar, hoverflies feed on pollen, and wasps occasionally feed on nectar. The pistils of pollinated flowers develop into a head of many small brown seeds, which are enclosed by a cup made up of the dried-up sepals. The root system is a taproot with short rhizomes at the surface, which allow the plant to form tight clumps. Drymocallis arguta is thought to be a protocarnivorous plant. In a 1999 experiment, several plants in the Pacific Northwest were tested for the carnivorous syndrome, using the digestion of proteins as the diagnostic tool to determine which plants appeared to produce protease enzymes capable of breaking down potential prey. D. arguta displayed a capability to digest and absorb the 14C-labeled algal protein placed on its sticky trichomes. However, it is not known whether the digestive enzymes were produced by the plant itself or surface microbes.Spomer, G. G. (1999).

One of five children (one of whom died in infancy), he grew up in Fairfield, Missouri, seven miles south of Warsaw near Route 83. The town is now covered by water, which occurred in the early 1970s when the Harry S. Truman Dam and Reservoir began filling. Biography He taught for five years in a one-room schoolhouse in Wisdom, Missouri. He attended Teacher's College in Liberty, Missouri, for two years to earn his teaching credential. He headed west in 1937, settling in San Diego two years later. One of his first jobs in San Diego was delivering milk door-to-door for Golden Arrow Dairy in a time when the milkman was part of daily life in America. In the late 1940s, while working for the dairy, he invented the Zip Whip‚Äîa device for whipping cream, which was featured in a book, The Eggbeater Chronicles.Thornton, Don (1999). The Eggbeater Chronicles Thornton House. Scott switched from delivering milk to selling insurance and later became a real estate broker, which he continued doing well into his 80s. Sports Scott played baseball during high school and, later, in a bush league against other counties. While still living in Fairfield, he became a local rodeo celebrity. He began playing racquetball in the 1950s and was ranked a top player for many years. Upon turning 70, Scott played 70 racquetball games against 70 opponents over a 10-day period for $1 to $5 a point, raising more than $1,500 for the National Kidney Foundation. During the 1980s he won gold, silver and bronze medals in both singles and doubles competitions for players 70 years and older in the Senior Olympics. Scott also played basketball, and in 1995 won a free throw basketball competition in San Diego in the 80-to-85 age bracket. He wrote a memoir, The Missouri Kid about growing up as a hillbilly in the Missouri Ozarks. He also wrote a pamphlet about salesmanship, which was published in the 1950s.

It essentially prevented the People's Republic of China from taking over the island of Taiwan. Some of its content was carried over to the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Background In the context of Cold War and the confrontation between capitalism and communism worldwide, the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of China secured the island of Taiwan from invasion by the People's Republic of China in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War on Mainland China. Rather than taking a multilateral approach to their alliances and treaties in East Asia, as had been done in Europe with NATO, the U.S. decided on a bilateral approach with its Asian allies (Free China, Japan, and South Korea), known as the San Francisco System or hubs-and-spokes system. Because the politics in Asia ranged from democratic to authoritarian, it would be difficult to find a base for multilateral relations stemming from shared values. Furthermore, the countries in Asia did not all face one common threat, unlike the West from the Soviet Union. It was therefore considered more beneficial to pursue bilateral relations. The treaty was signed on December 2, 1954, in Washington, D.C. and came into force on March 3, 1955. The treaty prolonged and assisted the Republic of China in maintaining legitimacy as the sole government of the whole of mainland China until the early 1970s. During the Cold War, the treaty also helped US policymakers to shape the policy of containment in East Asia together with South Korea and Japan against the spread of communism. Obligations The Badge of the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC, 1955-1979) MAAG,Taiwan (1951-1979) The treaty consists of ten main articles. The content of the treaty included the provision that if one country came under attack, the other would aid and provide military support. The treaty was limited in application to the defense of the island of Taiwan and the Pescadores only. Kinmen and Matsu were not protected by this treaty. Therefore, the US stood aside during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. The treaty also discouraged the Republic of China from initiating any military action against mainland China, since only Taiwan and Pescadores were included and unilateral military actions not supported. From the viewpoint of US Senate, in conjunction with the ratification of the MDT, a report issued Feb. 8, 1955, by the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations specified: \\"It is the view of the committee that the coming into force of the present treaty will not modify or affect the existing legal status of Formosa and the Pescadores.\\" To avoid any possibility of misunderstanding on this aspect of the treaty, the committee decided it would be useful to include in this report the following statement: It is the understanding of the Senate that nothing in the treaty shall be construed as affecting or modifying the legal status or sovereignty of the territories to which it applies.Appendix 17‚ÄîReport on Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China, U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations (1955) Impact # The relationship between the US and the Soviet Union has eased, and the US does not support a \\"counterattack on the mainland.\\" The Republic of China Armed Forces continued to counterattack on a small scale, with more defeats and less victory. As a result, the national army missed three major opportunities (the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Sino-Indian border conflict in 1962, and the Cultural Revolution in 1966), which completely stifled the hope of the Republic of China government to counterattack the mainland. # The benefits of this treaty are not limited to Taiwan and the United States, but extend to the entire Western Pacific, which is slightly different from the US-Japan Cooperation and Security Treaty and the US‚ÄìPhilippines Mutual Defense Treaty. # The basic spirit of this treaty is anti-Communist. It not only assists in defense of Taiwan in military force, but also prevents communism from infiltrating Taiwan. # The treaty stipulates that, in addition to self-defense, military actions taken by the Republic of China on Taiwan against mainland China should also comply with restrictions agreed by the United States. Truman restored the policy of neutrality across the Taiwan Strait to a certain extent. # Prevent the CCP from attacking Taiwan and establish the situation of long-term division of both sides of the Taiwan Strait. U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan to establish military security to ensure Taiwan‚Äôs development and turn Taiwan‚Äôs crisis into peace. # The nature of this treaty includes political, military, economic and social welfare, and it is a multi-purpose treaty. Termination Although the treaty has no time limit. However, Article 10 of the treaty stipulates that either party can terminate the treaty after notifying the other party for one year. Accordingly, the treaty came to an end on 1 January 1980, one year after the United States established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on 1 January 1979. The authority for President Jimmy Carter to unilaterally annul a treaty, in this case the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, was the topic of the Supreme Court case Goldwater v. Carter in which the court declined to rule on the legality of this action on jurisdictional grounds, thereby allowing it to proceed. Taiwan Relations Act Shortly after the United States' recognition of the People's Republic of China, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act. Some of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty's content survives in the Act; for example the definition of \\"Taiwan\\". It falls short of promising Taiwan direct military assistance in case of an invasion, however.

As a player, Lee was a solid, rather slow-scoring left-handed opening batsman. He played a couple of matches for Middlesex in 1925, but unable to command a regular place in the side he moved to Somerset, where he became qualified to play in 1929. He scored 107 in his third match for his new county, and though he struggled for runs in 1930 and did not complete 1,000 runs in a season for the first time until 1933, he was then a regular in the side until he retired after the 1947 season. His best batting year was 1938, when he scored 2,019 runs at an average of 44.86. He bowled only occasionally, but against Warwickshire at Taunton in 1933 he took five wickets for 53 runs. For several seasons right up to his retirement, he acted as reserve wicketkeeper if regular Somerset keeper Wally Luckes was ill or injured. Lee's first first-class match as an umpire came while he was still a player: he stood in the Somerset match with Cambridge University at Bath in 1947, and then played in the other matches of the Bath cricket festival. He then joined the first-class umpires' list for 1948 and a year later stood in the first of 29 Test matches. His most controversial Test match was the game at Lord's in 1960 between England and South Africa when he no-balled the South African fast-medium bowler Geoff Griffin 11 times for throwing. He and other umpires had already called Griffin for throwing earlier in the season, but this was the first time a touring team bowler had been called in a Test match. When the Lord's Test ended early, Lee's fellow umpire Syd Buller called Griffin again in the \\"friendly\\" match that was arranged to fill in the time, and the action of both umpires was instrumental in ending Griffin's career and in bringing to a head the problems of throwing and dragging that had affected international cricket for several years. Lee officiated in Tests until the end of the 1962 season, and retired from umpiring in first-class matches at the end of the 1963 season. His last match of any consequence as an umpire was the first-ever Gillette Cup final. Lee's brothers also played first-class cricket. Harry Lee, 15 years older than Frank Lee, was a batsman and spin bowler for Middlesex from 1911 to 1934 and played in one Test match. Jack Lee, three years older than Frank, played fleetingly for Middlesex and then pioneered the route down to Somerset, where he and Frank often opened the batting together.

In his playing days he was a left-handed batsman for Somerset County Cricket Club, making 15,230 runs in his 354 first- class games between 1960 and 1979. He topped the Somerset averages in 1966 and 1968. After retiring as a player he went on to become a first-class cricket umpire and he umpired in 20 Test matches and 28 One-Day Internationals before retiring from that at the age of 65 in 2005. Background and early cricket career Kitchen was born in Nailsea, Somerset where his father played local club cricket. He was educated locally at Backwell Secondary Modern School. He joined the playing staff at Somerset County Cricket Club as a 16-year-old in 1957 and appeared in the next three seasons for the county's second eleven in Minor Counties matches and, from 1959, in games in the newly constituted Second Eleven Championship. He made his debut for the Somerset first eleven in 1960 as a middle-order batsman, but made little impact in that or the next season, and in 1962 and 1963, although he played in around half of Somerset's first-class matches, his batting average was below 20 and his place was often dependent on injuries to other players. At this stage in his career, he was primarily a defensive batsman \\"which suited neither his temperament, for he was not a selfish man, nor his technique\\", according to one history of Somerset cricket. He played in most of Somerset's matches in the 1964 season and finally averaged more than 20 runs per innings, but returned to inconsistent performances and an uncertain place in the team in 1965. Somerset regular At the end of the 1965 season, Peter Wight, who had been a fixture in the Somerset side since 1955, batting at No 3, but whose form had declined markedly in the previous three seasons, was not re-engaged for the following year. The resulting vacancy in the Somerset batting line-up in 1966 was filled by Kitchen and he responded with his most successful season, finishing top of the county's batting averages with 1422 runs in all first- class matches. The batting style had changed as well, and Kitchen was a much more attacking player than he had been, exemplified by an innings in July in a non-first-class match against the International Cavaliers team at Bath, where he won the match by hitting both of the last two balls of a 38-over match from the South African Test bowler Neil Adcock for six. After this innings, Kitchen became a much more confident batsman and in the space of just over a week at the end of the season he made his first two first-class centuries and was awarded his county cap: \\"Until then in 142 innings he had not scored a century and had averaged under 20,\\" says the history of Somerset cricket.

Willing believes, that \\"every criminal leaves psychic fingerprints, and he can't wear gloves to hide them.\\" He appeared in 13 of McCloy's novels and in several of her short stories. McCloy often used the theme of doppelganger, but in the end of the story she showed a psychological or realistic explanation for the seemingly supernatural events. Biography Helen McCloy was born in New York City. Her mother was the writer Helen Worrell McCloy and father, William McCloy, was the longtime managing editor of the New York Evening Sun. She was educated at the Brooklyn Friends School, run by Brooklyn's Quaker community. In 1923 she went to France and studied at the Sorbonne. After finishing her studies, she worked for William Randolph Hearst's Universal News Service (1927‚Äì1932). Then she was an art critic for International Studio and other magazines, and free-lance contributor to London Morning Post and Parnassus. She returned to the United States in 1932. In 1946 McCloy married Davis Dresser, who had gained fame with his Mike Shayne novels, written under the pseudonym Brett Halliday. In 1948 they had a daughter, Chloe, Mccloy was 44 years old. She founded with Dresser the Torquil Publishing Company and a literary agency (Halliday and McCloy). Their marriage ended in 1961. In the 1950s and 1960s McCloy was a co-author of review column for Connecticut newspapers and in 1950 she became the first woman to serve as president of Mystery Writers of America. In 1954 she received an Edgar award from the same organization for her criticism. McCloy helped to found in 1971 a New England chapter of the Mystery Writers of America in Boston. Writing career Having read Sherlock Holmes as a young girl, McCloy retained an interest in mysteries and began to write them in the 1930s. Her first novel, Dance of Death, was published in 1938. It was followed by several other mystery publications in the 1940s. Cue for Murder (1942) was a story of murder onstage during a Broadway revival of Sardou's F√©dora. In Goblin Market (1943), reporters for two rival wire services investigate the death of one of their predecessors in a fictional South American country in the shadow of World War Two. The One That Got Away (1945) explored the psychology of Fascism, postulating that it is rooted in woman hatred, and rejection of a mother's tender care of children. A non-Willing mystery, Panic (1944), was set in a remote cottage in the Catskills and was notable for its use of cryptoanalysis. In Mr. Splitfoot (1968) Dr. Basil Willing and his wife take shelter at a remote house in New England, where they must lodge in a haunted room. The title refers to the Devil, but Mr Splitfoot is also a symbol for the two sides of our nature, as Willing points out. The critic and mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included the work in 1987 among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. Another successful work is the eighth Basil Willing novel, Through a Glass, Darkly (1950), a supernatural puzzle in the tradition of John Dickson Carr. \\"If you want to scare yourself still in bed, it's just the thing for you,\\" the English writer Pamela Hansford Johnson said of the book.

The Park is historically significant as the site of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898. About Kountze Park is bordered by 19th Street on the east and 20th Street on the west, Pinkney Street on the south and Pratt Street on the north. The park is the location of a water park, playground, basketball and tennis courts, and a pavilion. It is also home to a summer program operated by the City of Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.(n.d.) Kountze Park from the Omaha Parks Department website. History Once on a broad, flat plain midway between the Nebraska Territory towns of Omaha and Saratoga, Kountze Park was part of a plot belonging to banker Herman Kountze. Trans- Mississippi Exposition Site Night view of the Grand Court during the Trans- Mississippi Exposition in 1898. The Grand Court of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition was located in Kountze Park in 1898. When the search committee sought to acquire a large parcel of land to locate the city's highlight attraction, Kountze's generous offer of of land for $15,000.00, plus a donation of $5000 worth of land for this future park, was ideal.(n.d.)World's Fair and Exposition Information Guide Earth Station Nine website. The site was soon covered with buildings, boulevards, and a beautiful lagoon almost 1/2 mile long, lit by the latest technology of the times, electrical lights. The Greater America Exposition was held at the same location in many of the same buildings the following year. By the end of 1899, all of the buildings were demolished or removed. In the several years after the Exposition, the lagoon was filled in and the area was graded to form Kountze Park. Around the park a middle- and upper-class community grew, eventually forming a connection between Near North Omaha and Saratoga. A scenic pond remained at the park as a remnant of the original lagoon; it was filled with dirt in 1953. Modern times In 1980, while excavating for a new sewer in Kountze Park, a construction foreman uncovered several pieces of a building from the Exposition. An attempt to recover more artifacts was unsuccessful. Today there are only a few pieces of plaster from Exposition buildings that remain as tangible historical artifacts. In 1998 many improvements to Kountze Park were made, including new playground equipment, tree plantings and a historical marker that pays homage to the Exposition. Kountze Park has been a repeated crime location in recent years.(2006) Man arrested after shootout at Kountze Park .

She is credited with bringing religious support and helping reframe religious debates to include these nationwide issues. Biography Anguiano was the fourth of six children born to a Mexican-American migrant family who moved from Colorado to California between May and December to harvest fruit, vegetables and nuts. She earned a master's degree in administration and education from Antioch College. Anguiano joined Our Lady of Victory Missionary Sisters from 1949 to 1964. She chose the order for their reputation being advocates for the poor. She left the church after joining picket lines and protesting a prospective law set out by the California Association of Realtors to reverse the 1963 Rumford Fair Housing Act, which banned racial discrimination by landlords. Anguiano went on to work with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1965. She also consulted with government agencies and testified before state and national legislative bodies. She worked with Cesar Chavez, and in Michigan where she led the grape boycott of 1965. After leaving her post in the government, she focused on the welfare system as a result of becoming ‚Äúangry at the way in which the system traps young, healthy, and intelligent women; makes them dependent on welfare; destroys their pride and their willingness to work; and keeps them living always under the poverty level.‚Äù In 1973, her disillusionment led her back to San Antonio where she became national organizer for the United Farm Workers and founded the National Women‚Äôs Employment & Education Inc, which helps single female parents move beyond welfare poverty. She is a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus, along with Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug, and has worked on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment. Anguiano was a delegate to the historic \\"First Women's Conference\\" in Houston in 1977, where she, Jean Stapleton, and Coretta Scott King read the \\"Declaration of American Women.\\" In 1996, Congress passed landmark welfare reform legislation that contained many of her ideas.

It has been in operation since 2000. The festival's mission is to celebrate filmmaking from around the world and sponsor the art of film in California's Capital region. History For the 2011 season, the festival's 12th, the event was divided into two parts with the WinterFEST January 15‚Äì17 and the SummerFEST August 18‚Äì21. The WinterFEST dates coincided with the Martin Luther King holiday weekend and in addition to the usual range of film programming, the program documentaries with themes of politics, peace, and social justice including \\"Sowing the Seeds of Justice\\" about the life and legal career of Cruz Reynoso. The 2010 festival dates were July 23 - August 1, opening with the feature documentary \\"Official Rejection\\" about the difficulties of getting films into film festivals. In a special program on July 29, the 2010 Festival included the world premiere of \\"Walking Dreams\\" a documentary about the work of artist David Garibaldi, followed by a live performance of his work and a charity auction. In a performance of career significance, and in front of 600 attendees, David painted his first large format self-portrait. The five paintings created during the evening were sold, following the performance, with the proceeds benefiting both the festival and the Friends of the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission. The 2009 festival ran July 24 - Sunday, August 2. The 10th festival opened with a premiere screening of the independent feature, \\"Sensored\\" starring Robert Picardo and shot entirely on the Red One ultra-high definition digital camera. The festival kicked off 2009 with a Sac Music Seen New Year's Eve at the Crest Theatre with live music from The Dirty Feet and Autumn Sky, selected local music videos from the festival's own music video production program and a program of short films.Ritner, Anita, \\"Before the ball drops...pick up on some culture\\", Sacramento Bee's 21Q Entertainment Blog, December 31st, 2008 The 2008 festival dates were Friday, August 8 - Sunday, August 17. The 2008 festival included 17 feature films, over 100 short films and video projects, eight musical acts, two industry presentations, a pitch session, 30 ticketed events and the presentation of 25 awards. In a Gold Circle Series Screening, the festival hosted the West Coast premiere of UNCOUNTED: The New Math of American Elections. Filmmaker David Earnhardt was joined by radio host Peter B. Collins and political commentator Brad Friedman for a discussion regarding the film's topics of voting integrity and election fraud. In 2007, the eighth annual festival welcomed guests Larry Meistrich, principle of NEHST Studios and producer of such movies as the Academy Award winning Sling Blade and You Can Count On Me; Mike DiManno and Scott Reid, CEO and President respectively of Redwood Palms Pictures; and writer/director Joe Carnahan. During the 2007 Festival, 99 films were screened in competition, plus five short movies produced for The Sacramento Bee. In an eight-hour marathon pitch session, Larry Meistrich met with filmmakers and prospective filmmakers, directly resulting in four development deals. In 2007, the festival added the marquee sponsor Sactown Magazine, in a relationship that lasted three seasons. In 2006, the seventh annual festival featured over 90 film and video projects and four live bands over five days, including the special programs Sac Music Seen (a local music video production program), the 10x10 Filmmaker Challenge (a 10-day filmmaking program), and Student Days (a student film festival within the larger event).Dunn, Edward, \\"The Sacramento Film and Music Festival\\", Sacramento News and Review, July 27, 2006.

Programs are determined based on the nature of submissions received and the opinions of the screening committee. A separate film jury determines award winners, in addition to the audience awards.  Sac Music Seen  The Sac Music Seen program pairs local musicians and bands with local filmmakers to produce music videos. While the larger festival also accepts music videos for general programming, Sac Music Seen has been supported by such entities as the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission and the Sacramento Bee. In the first seven years of the program's existence (2004-2010), it produced 150 original music videos.  10x10 Filmmaker Challenge  In anotherSF&MF; program, the 10x10 filmmakers are given 10 days to make a movie of no more than 10 minutes on a given theme. The program started as a midnight screening experiment in 2004 with seven films on the topic of \\"the Undead and the Seven Deadly Sins\\". Up to 2009, approximately 70 originals projects have been completed and screened and the program has become the closing event of the Festival.  Sony Creative Software Student Days  Added to the festival in 2006, Student Days is a program that shows the works of student filmmakers. The first Student Days program featured 20 projects over two afternoons and included works from the American Film Institute, Chapman University, Columbia College Chicago, New York University, Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, the University of California Los Angeles, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Southern California.

Design and development In December 1930, Fieseler was invited by the Swedish Air Force (Flygvapnet) to present his aircraft for the Swedish aircraft manufacturing company ASJA. Flygvapnet was in need for a new trainer, and the RK-26 was an interesting aircraft. Fieseler had recently won a world aerobatics championship with an RK-26. ASJA then decided to buy one aircraft. It was tested with different engine configurations by Flygvapnet, who later ordered 25 aircraft from ASJA. Operational history The trainer was given the designation Sk 10 by Flygvapnet. It was used between 1932 and 1945, but was quite controversial during its active life. This was partly due to changes in the design, which made the aircraft 200 kg heavier than the original, and this changed its flight characteristics drastically. The aircraft was involved in many accidents. Of the 25 delivered aircraft, 18 were written off. One aircraft, the SE-ADK was purchased in 1934 by a civilian, L. Hemmeringer. When the Winter War began, Hemmeninger donated the aircraft to Finland. The aircraft ended up being used by the Swedish Voluntary Air Force from 9 February 1940. The aircraft was painted in Finnish colors, but was used quite sparingly, due to lack of spares and the bad condition of its engine. Most of the time it was standing at the air force base in Veitsiluoto. Surviving craft One Sk 10, the only remaining Tigerschwalbe, is preserved at the Flygvapenmuseum.

It is located between the towns of Shoshoni and Thermopolis and is a popular stop for visitors to Yellowstone National Park. It is accessible by U.S. Highway 20 and Wyoming Highway 789. It was designated as a Wyoming Scenic Byway in 2005. Description U.S. 20/Wyo 789 travel through the canyon, at times level with the canyon floor. The scenic route offers views of the canyon and landmark natural structures like the Chimney Rock. The canyon is at times as much as feet deep. The change in elevation between the Bighorn Basin and the Wind River Basin is about . The southern mouth of the canyon is near the Boysen Dam in Boysen State Park several miles north of, and about half a mile east of, the state park's borders with the Wind River Indian Reservation. The canyon includes a number of homes along the highway and a Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad line. The north end of the canyon is at the Wedding of the Waters, where the Wind becomes the Bighorn River. The Scenic Byway continues for several miles through Thermopolis and ends at T Hill on the north end of that town in Hot Springs State Park. The Wind and Big Horn flow north out of Boysen Reservoir, through the canyon, into Thermopolis, and onward to points north. Geology The canyon cuts through a comprehensive set of Wyoming rock strata exposures. Many of these are noted on roadside signs. The canyon was cut in the established course of the Wind River, which predates the uplift of the Owl Creek Mountains. The water gap was created as the topography of the mountains was raised over the past two million years from previously flat terrain. From south to north, the canyon crosses an area of complex faulting, then narrows as it descends into Precambrian rocks at three road tunnels. Beyond the tunnels, the strata dip, with high cliffs of sedimentary Madison Limestone, Bighorn Dolomite and sandstone. The northern end of the canyon cuts through red sandstone of the Chugwater Formation.

Drawing by Ivan Pranishnikopf, from photographs. Published in Harper's Illustrated Weekly, May 18, 1876. The Red Cloud Agency was an Indian agency for the Oglala Lakota as well as the Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho, from 1871 to 1878. It was located at three different sites in Wyoming Territory and Nebraska before being moved to South Dakota. It was then renamed the Pine Ridge Reservation.  Red Cloud Agency No. 1 (1871-1873)  As stipulated in the Fort Laramie Treaty (1868), the US government built Indian agencies for the various Lakota and other Plains tribes. These were forerunners to the modern Indian reservations. The Red Cloud Agency was established for the Oglala Lakota in 1871 on the North Platte River in Wyoming Territory. The location was one mile west of the present town of Henry, Nebraska.  Red Cloud Agency No. 2 (1873-1877)  In August 1873, the agency was moved to the northwestern corner of Nebraska, near the present town of Crawford. Constructed on a hill overlooking the White River, the agency buildings included a large warehouse, offices, home for the agent, blacksmith shop and stables for horses. A school house was later added. Two trading stores were also built adjacent to the agency. Following the killing of agency clerk Frank Appleton, the government assigned US troops to the agency in March 1874. The military encampment was named Camp Robinson (later known as Fort Robinson). The Red Cloud Agency was the center of much activity during the Great Sioux War of 1876-77. In May 1877, Crazy Horse and allied leaders came with their people to the Red Cloud Agency for surrender. Following the killing of Crazy Horse, the agency was moved further west. The site of Red Cloud Agency No. 2 is included in Fort Robinson and Red Cloud Agency, a United States National Historic Landmark.  Red Cloud Agency No. 3 (1877-1878)  The agency was moved to the White River in October 1877, in present day, South-Central South Dakota.  Pine Ridge Agency  In 1878, the Red Cloud Agency was relocated to southern South Dakota and renamed the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Indian Agents *James Wham *Jared Daniels *Dr. John J.

She won a bronze medal in the 100 m backstroke at the 1952 Summer Olympics. Biography Born in Dunedin in 1930, Stewart was educated at Otago Girls' High School. When she was active as a swimmer, New Zealand had no swimming coach, and Stewart was mentored by Bill Wallace, who she described as an \\"enthusiast\\". Wallace had an interest in horse racing and from that, Stewart adopted interval training as an innovation. She had also set up a pulley system in her bedroom for weight training that was specific to swimming. She represented her native country at two consecutive Summer Olympics, 1952 and 1956. In 1952 she won the bronze medal in the women's 100 metres backstroke at the Helsinki Games. She shared a room in Helsinki with the only other New Zealand female competitor, Yvette Williams, who was also from Dunedin. Stewart also won medals in the 110 yards backstroke at the Empire Games; silver in 1950 and bronze in 1954. As of 2016, she remains the only New Zealand woman to have won an Olympic swimming medal. Stewart won 12 New Zealand national swimming titles: the 100 yards backstroke every year from 1950 to 1956 except 1955; the 220 yards backstroke every year from 1950 to 1954; and the 100 yards butterfly in 1953. Stewart married fellow Dunedin swimmer Lincoln Hurring after the Helsinki Games, and they settled in Auckland. Their son is world silver medalist swimmer Gary Hurring. As of 2016, Hurring lived in a retirement village in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore. Her son keeps her Olympic medal.

Born in Ohinemutu, New Zealand, in 1913, Manahi worked as a laborer before he volunteered for service in the newly raised MƒÅori Battalion of the New Zealand Military Forces following the outbreak of the Second World War. He participated in the Battle of Greece and fought in the Battle of Crete during which he was wounded. After recovering from his wounds he returned to the MƒÅori Battalion, and fought through the Western Desert and Tunisian Campaigns during which he was nominated for a Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Takrouna. Despite the support of four generals, his VC nomination was downgraded to an award of a Distinguished Conduct Medal. In June 1943, he returned to New Zealand on a three-month furlough but when this was completed, was not required to return to active duty. After his discharge from the New Zealand Military Forces, he was employed as a traffic inspector. He was killed in a car crash in 1986. After his death, representations by his Te Arawa iwi (tribe) were made to Buckingham Palace for a posthumous award of the VC. These representations were ultimately unsuccessful due to the period of time that had elapsed since the war. In 2007, he eventually received a special citation for bravery from the Queen. Early life Haane Te Rauawa Manahi, the youngest son of a farm labourer, was born on 28 September 1913 in Ohinemutu, a village on the shores of Lake Rotorua in the North Island of New Zealand. Of Te Arawa and NgƒÅti Raukawa descent (and a little Scottish from his mother), he attended local schools in the area up to secondary school level. After leaving school, he worked in road construction and undertook farm work. He also spent time in the timber and building industries alongside his uncle, Matiu,Bennett, 2000 p. 331 who had served in the first contingent of New Zealand MƒÅori to be raised for military duty during the First World War.Moon, 2010, p. 17 Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Manahi was one of the first men to enlist in November 1939 in the newly formed MƒÅori Battalion. The battalion was composed of a headquarters company and four rifle companies, which were organised along tribal lines. Manahi was assigned to B Company, made up largely of other men from Te Arawa.Moon, 2010, p. 27 In May 1940, after a period of training at Trentham Military Camp, the battalion embarked for the Middle East as part of the second echelon of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). En route, the convoy carrying the second echelon was diverted to England, where it would remain until January 1941 engaged in further training and defensive duties.McGibbon, 2000, p. 309 Greece and Crete On 27 March 1941, Manahi's battalion, having spent two months in Egypt, arrived in Greece to assist in its defence against an anticipated German invasion.Moon, 2010, p. 47 It initially took up defensive positions around Olympus Pass, and in the days following the beginning of the invasion on 6 April, rebuffed initial contact by the advancing Germans. The battalion had to withdraw as the flanks of the Allied positions were threatened. B Company was the last of the battalion's units to abandon its positions, and together with the rest of the Allies, withdrew over the following days to Porto Rafti, where it boarded a transport ship for Crete.Moon, 2010, pp. 49-50 On Crete, the Allies dug in for the expected airborne attack by German paratroopers. The MƒÅori Battalion was positioned near the town of Platanias, as a reserve for 5th Infantry Brigade which was tasked with the defence of Maleme Airfield.Moon, 2010, p. 53 On 20 May, the attack commenced. Manahi was returning to his trench, having just had breakfast, as planes and gliders flew overhead, discharging paratroopers.Moon, 2010, p. 55 During fighting for the airfield, Manahi was wounded in the chest.Moon, 2010, p. 57 Despite his wounds, he would remain with his company as it was forced to withdraw to the southwest in the following days and was eventually evacuated from Crete on 31 May.Moon, 2010, p. 60 North Africa After a period of recuperation, Manahi returned to the normal routine of training for desert warfareMoon, 2010, p. 64 and constructing defensive positions around the Baggush Box. In November he, along with rest of the 2nd Division, participated in Operation Crusader. This involved near constant fighting across Libya for well over a month, during which Manahi, with two others, captured and commandeered a German tank which had been stuck in B Company's trenches.Moon, 2010, p. 70 In early 1942, the New Zealanders were withdrawn to Syria for a period of rest and garrison duty.Moon, 2010, p. 73 However, in late May 1942 Rommel and the Afrika Korps attacked into Libya. The 2nd Division was rushed back from Syria and dug in at Minqar Qaim. Encircled by the Germans, the division was forced to breakout on 26 June and withdrew to positions around El Alamein.Moon, 2010, p. 75 Here, suffering regular artillery barrages, it dug in to await an expected attack. In late August, no attack had been launched and it was decided a raid for prisoners would be undertaken by two companies, one of them being Manahi's B Company. This was successfully executed on 26 August.Moon, 2010, p. 77 The next month, the battalion was taken out of the line for a brief period of rest before returning for the Second Battle of El Alamein. During the fourth stage of the battle, in what was codenamed Operation Supercharge, Manahi and his company was involved in a bayonet charge against well dug in Germans that had resisted a previous attack by another battalion.Moon, 2010, p. 79 By now, it was clear that the Germans were in retreat and the Allies pursued them into Libya and Tunisia. After a battle at Tebaga Gap, during which Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu of the battalion's C Company won the Victoria Cross (VC),Moon, 2010, pp. 81-82 planning began for a push into Tunisia's capital city Tunis. Before this could be achieved, a defensive line around Enfidaville needed to be broken.Moon, 2010, p. 86 Takrouna By April 1943, the 2nd Division had advanced into mountainous country overlooking Enfidaville. Takrouna was a hill, 300 metres high, held by soldiers of the Italian Trieste Division's I/66¬∞ Battalion as well as a German platoon. A village was situated on the summit of the hill with a prominent ledge to one side. The MƒÅori Battalion was tasked by Major General Howard Kippenberger, commander of 2nd Division, with the capture of Takrouna, and B Company would make the main assault on 19 April, with C and D companies on the flanks. The initial attack petered out due to heavy gunfire from the enemy. Bennett ordered Manahi, now a lance sergeant, to take his platoon of 12 men to make a feint attack while the remainder of B Company linked up with C Company. The platoon split into two sections, with one under the command of Manahi. At dawn, they began their attack up a steep and at times near sheer slope and were successfully able to overwhelm the Italians defending the ledge, capturing 60 prisoners. The New Zealanders then dug in and prepared for a counterattack. Artillery and mortar fire killed half of the platoon, including its commander. This left Manahi in command.Gardiner, 1992, pp. 120-122 The upper slopes of Takrouna, Tunisia, on 1 June 1943, with graves in the foreground. This photograph gives an indication of the difficult terrain over which Manahi had led his men With two attempts to contact the battalion having failed, Manahi made his way down Takrouna to locate reinforcements and supplies. Ignoring an officer's advice that he abandon the ledge, he returned with a section from C Company as well as ammunition and stretcher bearers. A further platoon arrived to further consolidate his position. The expected counterattack then commenced, and this was successfully beaten off. It was only then, after having been on Takrouna for 16 hours that Manahi and what was left of his section withdrew, leaving the platoon to hold the position.Gardiner, 1992, pp. 122-124 Despite reinforcements, a further counterattack launched by Italian soldiers of the Trieste Division on 21 April dislodged the New Zealanders and control of the ledge was lost. Kippenberger ordered the MƒÅori Battalion to send reinforcements to rectify the situation. Manahi returned with a platoon to recapture the lost position, and with artillery support the attack was successful and by midday the ledge was reoccupied by the New Zealanders. However, the village on the summit remained in the hands of the Italians. Later in the afternoon of 21 April, Manahi led an attacking party which, working with another party, captured the village and took 300 prisoners. After the battle, he assisted with the recovery of the bodies of his dead comrades.Harper & Richardson, 2007, pp. 275-276 Manahi's exploits quickly became known throughout the division, and within a few days of his actions a nomination for the VC had been prepared by the commander of his battalion. Brigadier Harding, commander of 5th Infantry Brigade, endorsed the nomination as did four generals (Kippenberger, Freyberg, Montgomery and Alexander). General Henry Maitland Wilson, commander-in-chief, Middle East Forces, likewise endorsed the award after considering the evidence.Moon, 2010, p. 115 However, when the nomination reached the Army Council in London, the award was downgraded, most likely by the Chief of the General Staff, General Alan Brooke,Moon, 2010, p. 119 to an immediate Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) which was duly gazetted on 22 July 1943. The decision was a disappointment to many in the 2nd Division. Reports that Manahi's men had killed Italians attempting to surrender were thought by some historians to be a factor in the downgrading of his award.Moon, 2010, p. 100 The official New Zealand history of the MƒÅori Battalion stated that the surrendering soldiers were \\"shot, bayonetted or thrown over a cliff\\" but only after an Italian grenade had been thrown into a building in which wounded New Zealanders were sheltering.Cody, 1956, p. 305 However, these reports may not have emerged until after the downgrading, and at the time the killings were alleged to have occurred, Manahi himself was reportedly dealing with an advance by Italian soldiers against the ledge. Another factor in the downgrading may have been the recent VC nomination for Ngarimu, just three weeks earlier. The subsequent nomination of Manahi, a MƒÅori like Ngarimu and from the same battalion, may have led to a perception that VCs were being too easily awarded.Moon, 2010, p. 123 Return to New Zealand The surrender of the Axis forces in Tunisia in May left the Allies in control of North Africa. The 2nd Division withdrew to its base in Egypt and it was announced that 6,000 of its personnel would return to New Zealand for a three-month furlough. Manahi, as one of the original members of the MƒÅori Battalion, was among those selected and shipped out on 15 June 1943.Moon, 2010, pp. 109-110 However, Manahi was not to return to the war for it was later decided that the MƒÅori soldiers on furlough would be exempt from active duty.McGibbon, 2000, p. 189 On returning to Rotorua, Manahi entered a carpentry course and then began working at the Rotorua Hospital as a carpenter.Moon, 2010, pp. 128-130 On 18 December 1945, he was presented with his DCM by Cyril Newall, the Governor-General of New Zealand, in a ceremony at the Auckland Town Hall. He was later selected for the New Zealand Victory Contingent, destined for England to celebrate the Commonwealth's role in the war. As part of the contingent, he participated in the Victory Parade in London on 8 June 1946. This fulfilled his last military obligations, and he was discharged in August 1946. Later life Following his discharge, Manahi returned to the work force. Employed by the Ministry of Works, he became a traffic inspector which involved traveling around the Bay of Plenty. A keen sportsman, he became involved in swimming coaching as well golf and fishing. When his wife died in 1976, he moved away from Rotorua to nearby Maketu, on the coast. He still commuted to Rotoroa to spend time at the local branch of the New Zealand Returned Servicemen's Association (RSA). On the evening of 29 March 1986, on the way home from the RSA club rooms, he was involved in a car crash. He received severe chest and abdominal injuries and was rushed to Tauranga Hospital where he died later in the evening. His tangi (funeral) was held at the marae (tribal meeting area) in his home village of Ohinemutu, and was attended by members of the Maori Battalion.Moon, 2010, pp. 132-133 Survived by two sons, he was buried at Muruika cemetery. The Manahi VC Committee The situation regarding Manahi's VC recommendation during the Battle of Takrouna still rankled with many members of the MƒÅori Battalion but while he was alive, Manahi's modesty and unwillingness to bring any attention to himself meant that he was not interested in changing the situation. Following his death, the Manahi VC Committee was established by his former comrades and iwi (tribe) to lobby for an upgrade to his award.Moon, 2010, p. 135 The committee lobbied the New Zealand government to make representations to Buckingham Palace regarding the posthumous grant of the VC to Manahi. The Queen's father, King George VI, had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made. The New Zealand government was reluctant to make a formal approach and it took until 1997 for Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley to formally broach the subject with Buckingham Palace. The feedback indicated the elapsed time since the events of Takrouna was likely to be a barrier to awarding Manahi a VC. Finally, in 2000, Manahi's iwi, Te Arawa, lodged a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal,Moon, 2010, pp. 141-142 and was supported in doing so by the New Zealand RSA. Te Arawa alleged the failure of the New Zealand government to give full consideration of the award of a VC to Manahi constituted a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi, which required the government to act in good faith regarding grievances of MƒÅori. In December 2005 the tribunal reported that there was no breach of the treaty. While not making any formal conclusions or recommendations, the tribunal suggested that the Manahi VC Committee work with the New Zealand government in making an approach to Buckingham Palace. In October 2006, after further dialogue with Buckingham Palace, the New Zealand Minister of Defence, Phil Goff, announced that Manahi would be recognised by the presentation of an altar cloth, a personal letter from the Queen acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. The award was presented by Prince Andrew to Manahi's sons, Rauawa and Geoffrey, at a ceremony in Rotorua on 17 March 2007. The sword was later presented to the Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force, Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae, along with a patu (war club) in memory of Haane Manahi.

Above, the rotor is powered and pushing air downward, generating lift and thrust. Below, the helicopter rotor has lost power, and the craft is making an emergency landing, Autorotation is a state of flight in which the main rotor system of a helicopter or other rotary-wing aircraft turns by the action of air moving up through the rotor, as with an autogyro, rather than engine power driving the rotor.Bensen, Igor. \\"How they fly ‚Äì Bensen explains all \\" Gyrocopters UK.

The term autorotation dates to a period of early helicopter development between 1915 and 1920, and refers to the rotors turning without the engine.\\"Autorotation\\", Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. 17 April 2007 It is analogous to the gliding flight of a fixed-wing aircraft. The most common use of autorotation in helicopters is to safely land the aircraft in the event of an engine failure or tail-rotor failure. It is a common emergency procedure taught to helicopter pilots as part of their training. In normal powered helicopter flight, air is drawn into the main rotor system from above and exhausted downward, but during autorotation, air moves up into the rotor system from below as the helicopter descends. Autorotation is permitted mechanically because of both a freewheeling unit, which allows the main rotor to continue turning even if the engine is not running, as well as aerodynamic forces of relative wind maintaining rotor speed. It is the means by which a helicopter can land safely in the event of complete engine failure. Consequently, all single-engine helicopters must demonstrate this capability to obtain a type certificate.USA Federal Aviation Regulations, ¬ß27.71 Autorotation performance The longest autorotation in history was performed by Jean Boulet in 1972 when he reached a record altitude of 12,440 m (40,814 ft) in an A√©rospatiale SA 315B Lama. Because of a ‚àí63 ¬∞C (‚àí81.4 ¬∞F) temperature at that altitude, as soon as he reduced power the engine flamed out and could not be restarted. By using autorotation he was able to land the aircraft safely.  Descent and landing  For a helicopter, \\"autorotation\\" refers to the descending maneuver in which the engine is disengaged from the main rotor system and the rotor blades are driven solely by the upward flow of air through the rotor. The freewheeling unit is a special clutch mechanism that disengages any time the engine rotational speed is less than the rotor rotational speed. If the engine fails, the freewheeling unit automatically disengages the engine from the main rotor allowing the main rotor to rotate freely. The most common reason for autorotation is an engine malfunction or failure, but autorotation can also be performed in the event of a complete tail rotor failure, or following loss of tail-rotor effectiveness,Rotorcraft Flying Handbook Section 11-12, Federal Aviation Administration, Skyhorse Publishing (July 2007) since there is virtually no torque produced in an autorotation. If altitude permits, autorotations may also be used to recover from vortex ring state. In all cases, a successful landing depends on the helicopter's height and velocity at the commencement of autorotation (see height-velocity diagram). At the instant of engine failure, the main rotor blades are producing lift and thrust from their angle of attack and velocity. By immediately lowering collective pitch, which must be done in case of an engine failure, the pilot reduces lift and drag and the helicopter begins an immediate descent, producing an upward flow of air through the rotor system. This upward flow of air through the rotor provides sufficient thrust to maintain rotor rotational speed throughout the descent. Since the tail rotor is driven by the main rotor transmission during autorotation, heading control is maintained as in normal flight. Several factors affect the rate of descent in autorotation: density altitude, gross weight, rotor rotational speed, and forward airspeed. The pilot's primary control of the rate of descent is airspeed. Higher or lower airspeeds are obtained with the cyclic pitch control just as in normal flight. Rate of descent is high at zero airspeed and decreases to a minimum at approximately 50 to 90 knots, depending upon the particular helicopter and the factors previously mentioned. As the airspeed increases beyond the speed that gives minimum rate of descent, the rate of descent increases again. Even at zero airspeed, the rotor is quite effective as it has nearly the drag coefficient of a parachuteJohnson, Wayne. Helicopter theory p109, Courier Dover Publications, 1980. Accessed: 25 February 2012. despite having much lower solidity. When landing from an autorotation, the kinetic energy stored in the rotating blades is used to decrease the rate of descent and make a soft landing. A greater amount of rotor energy is required to stop a helicopter with a high rate of descent than is required to stop a helicopter that is descending more slowly. Therefore, autorotative descents at very low or very high airspeeds are more critical than those performed at the minimum rate of descent airspeed. Each type of helicopter has a specific airspeed at which a power-off glide is most efficient. The best airspeed is the one that combines the greatest glide range with the slowest rate of descent. The specific airspeed is different for each type of helicopter, yet certain factors (density altitude, wind) affect all configurations in the same manner. The specific airspeed for autorotations is established for each type of helicopter on the basis of average weather and wind conditions and normal loading. A helicopter operated with heavy loads in high density altitude or gusty wind conditions can achieve best performance from a slightly increased airspeed in the descent. At low density altitude and light loading, best performance is achieved from a slight decrease in normal airspeed. Following this general procedure of fitting airspeed to existing conditions, the pilot can achieve approximately the same glide angle in any set of circumstances and estimate the touchdown point. This optimum glide angle is usually 17‚Äì20 degrees.Paul Cantrell. \\"Aerodynamics of Autorotation ‚Äì steady state descent \\" Copters Accessed: 11 November 2013.  Autorotational regions  Blade regions in vertical autorotation descent. During vertical autorotation, the rotor disc is divided into three regions‚Äîthe driven region, the driving region, and the stall region. The size of these regions vary with the blade pitch, rate of descent, and rotor rotational speed. When changing autorotative rotational speed, blade pitch, or rate of descent, the size of the regions change in relation to each other. The driven region, also called the propeller region, is the region at the end of the blades. Normally, it consists of about 30 percent of the radius. It is the driven region that produces the most drag. The overall result is a deceleration in the rotation of the blade. The driving region, or autorotative region, normally lies between 25 and 70 percent of the blade radius, which produces the forces needed to turn the blades during autorotation. Total aerodynamic force in the driving region is inclined slightly forward of the axis of rotation, producing a continual acceleration force. This inclination supplies thrust, which tends to accelerate the rotation of the blade. Driving region size varies with blade pitch setting, rate of descent, and rotor rotational speed. The inner 25 percent of the rotor blade is referred to as the stall region and operates above its maximum angle of attack (stall angle) causing drag, which slows rotation of the blade. A constant rotor rotational speed is achieved by adjusting the collective pitch so blade acceleration forces from the driving region are balanced with the deceleration forces from the driven and stall regions. By controlling the size of the driving region, the pilot can adjust autorotative rotational speed. For example, if the collective pitch is raised, the pitch angle increases in all regions. This causes the point of equilibrium to move inboard along the blade's span, thereby increasing the size of the driven region. The stall region also becomes larger while the driving region becomes smaller. Reducing the size of the driving region causes the acceleration force of the driving region and rotational speed to decrease.

The requirements for the award, as stated in Army Regulation 672-74, are, \\"An aircrew member must, through outstanding airmanship, minimize or prevent aircraft damage or injury to personnel during an emergency situation.

Miyuki is not as physically tough as Natsumi, but she is much smarter and more polite. A technical genius, Miyuki frequently performs custom vehicle modifications for various people at the precinct, as well as being an expert with computers. Miyuki is a superb driver, almost as daring as Natsumi, and very difficult to shake in a pursuit . She is also punctual, shy and diligent ‚Äì in contrast to Natsumi, who is tardy, brash and frequently lazy. Her mini patrol car, a Honda Today, is a heavily modified version for patrol duties. Starting with the Today's 545 cc EH engine, Miyuki has stroked it out to 600 cc and turbocharged as well as converted to DOHC. Later she swaps the engine to a 700 cc stroked version of the later 656 cc MTREC engine (although still having a yellow number plate for K-cars), also with twin cams, a turbocharger, an intercooler, and nitrous oxide boost. She also has a blue Toyota Sports 800 as her personal car. Unlike Natsumi's infatuation towards the chief (Kachou) of Traffic Division, Miyuki admires and respects him because of his dedication in working with the division. During situations where force was the only solution, Miyuki uses airsoft guns with paintball bullets in order to incapacitate or to leave a homing beacon on the opponents. Her love interest happens to be with the \\"White Hawk\\" Ken Nakajima but has initial difficulty in telling him until the end of the series.See Season 2, Episode 26: A Hot Spring, A Yukata, A Confession.

She resides currently in K≈çt≈ç, Tokyo alongside Natsumi.Provided by Miyuki Kobayakawa fan-compiled profile Retrieved on December 9, 2007 When she was trying to pick up Natsumi, she met with her instead by luck when seeing her breaking some of traffic violation rules (to the point that her driving license can be suspended) but she knew at once that she's Natsumi, her partner to be. Eventually catching up with her, Miyuki made a first impression with her and after Natsumi's transfer to Bokuto Station was complete, Miyuki and Natsumi became partners in the station's Traffic Division. The two became famous with Miyuki's brains and Natsumi's fists in solving various cases involving either themselves or with their colleagues.

Nearing the end of the movie, she and Natsumi apprehend renegade officer Tadashi Emoto after wounding Kachou as a means of \\"proving\\" that he acted alone throughout the crisis. Miyuki was sent to Los Angeles with Natsumi as part of a foreign police officer exchange program for a short time with the Los Angeles Police Department.As depicted in the \\"No Mercy\\" OVA special. Nearing the end of the series, Miyuki nearly broke her friendship with Natsumi after learning that the latter was being recruited into the Special Assault Team. The two patched up their differences when Miyuki told Natsumi that she wasn't open enough for her to accept Natsumi's recruitment into the SAT Miyuki: \\"Time really passes by fast. From becoming a policewoman, to partners with Natsumi at Bokuto Station. It seems like it just happened yesterday.\\" (Live-eviL - 2nd Season, Episode 24: To Each His Own Way) since the two had acted like real friends, even like sisters when Miyuki explained that Natsumi's SAT recruitment happened so fast without her realizing it all along, which forced her to shield herself from seeing reality as it was.Miyuki: \\"But time is really passing by. Saori-chan has grown up. But I was the only one that didn't open up. I didn't even know how I felt. I got furious when Natsumi said it. I don't want to be dumped like that. I have to go on.\\" (Live-eviL - 2nd Season, Episode 24: To Each His Own Way) Miyuki also renewed her \\"friendship\\" with Nakajima, further opening their relationship to other possibilities. Her partner is Saori Saga, who took over Natsumi's position after she was permanently stationed in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department branch as part of her duties as an SAT operative See Season 2, Episode 24: To Each His Own Way. before being transferred to the United States to conduct forensic training. „ÄåNegative One Year Before Disappear of Megumi Yokota kun„ÄçSee Full Throttle, Episode 1: Intense Chase Prologue.

These were assigned letters A‚ÄìS and divided into decades (groups A10, A20, etc.); individual languages were assigned unit numbers (A11, A12, etc.), and dialects further subdivided (A11a, A11b, etc.). This coding system has become the standard for identifying Bantu languages; it was the only practical way to distinguish many ambiguously named languages before the introduction of ISO 639-3 coding, and it continues to be widely used. Only Guthrie's Zone S is (sometimes) considered to be a genealogical group. Since Guthrie's time a Zone J (made of languages formerly classified in groups D and E) has been set up as another possible genealogical group bordering the Great Lakes. The list is first summarized, with links to articles on accepted groups of Bantu languages (bold decade headings). Following that is the complete 1948 list, as updated by Guthrie in 1971 and by J. F. Maho in 2009. Summary The list below reflects Guthrie as updated by Maho (2009). Not included in detail are the Northeast Bantu languages characterized by Dahl's Law, which is thought to be a genealogical group, cuts across the Guthrie system, and is covered at Northeast Bantu. Other groups with dedicated articles, such as Southern Bantu (Zone S) are also only summarized here, so that the initial listing is only a summary and an index for other articles. Note that Ethnologue made multiple changes to Guthrie in an attempt to make the classification more historically accurate. However, the changes are inconsistent, and Ethnologue has not been followed here, though it is publicly available online. Thus a code may mean different things depending on whether Guthrie or SIL is being followed. (See link below for the SIL code assignments.) The updates in Maho (2009), on the other hand, are designed to be compatible with the original values of the codes. Bantu has long been divided into Northwest Bantu (Forest Bantu) and Central Bantu (Savanna Bantu) branches based upon tone patterns, but there is little agreement as to which Guthrie zones (or which parts of zones) should be in either, the dichotomy is dubious, and they have not been followed here. Accepted genealogical groups within the Guthrie zones are boldfaced. Zone A S Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, N Gabon *A10 Lundu‚ÄìBalong : Oroko (likely one of the Sawabantu languages); the other languages apart from A15 Manenguba (that is, Bonkeng, Nkongho, Bafaw-Balong) may be Sawabantu as well. **A15 Manenguba (Ngoe) languages *A20‚Äì30 Sawabantu languages; Bube (in Mbam?) *A40a (reduced) Basaa languages *A50 Bafia languages *A60+40b Mbam languages (Jarawan added after Guthrie) *A70 Beti language *A80‚Äì90 Makaa‚ÄìNjem languages Zone A is sometimes considered Forest Bantu. Guthrie's A60 and part of his A40 have been removed to the Southern Bantoid Mbam languages. Sawabantu may include some of the A10 languages apart from Manenguba, whereas Bube may belong in Mbam. Southern Bantoid Jarawan was assigned to Zone A by Gerhardt (1982) and Blench (ms 2006, 2011), specifically to A60, within Mbam. According to several scholars, including Blench, there can be no coherent concept of Bantu as long as many of the Zone A and perhaps Zone B languages are included. Zone B S Gabon, W Congo, W DR-Congo *B20 Kele languages (?Seki) *B10‚Äì30 Tsogo languages (?Myene) *B40 (with some H10) Sira languages *B50 Nzebi languages *B60 Mbete languages *B70 (with some B80) Teke languages *B80 (reduced) Boma‚ÄìDzing languages (Tsong/Songo?) Zone B is sometimes considered Forest Bantu. B10‚Äì30 may belong together as Kele‚ÄìTsogo, B40 with Kongo‚ÄìYaka (H), and B50‚Äì70 with H24 Songo as Teke‚ÄìMbede. Zone C NE DR-Congo, N Congo *C10 (with some C30) Ngondi‚ÄìNgiri languages *C20 Mboshi languages *C30 (with Mongo, etc) Bangi‚ÄìNtomba languages (Lingala et al.) *C37+41 Buja‚ÄìNgombe languages *C42 Bwela *C40a Bati‚ÄìAngba languages (Bwa) *C50‚Äì60 Soko languages *C70 Tetela languages *C80 Bushoong languages Zone C is sometimes considered Forest Bantu, sometimes Savanna Bantu. There are proposals for three larger clades, Mboshi‚ÄìBuja covering C10‚Äì20 and C37+41, and Bangi‚ÄìTetela covering C30 with C50‚Äì80 (Motingea 1996), and C40a together with D20‚Äì30 in Boan. Zone D NE DR-Congo *D10 Mbole‚ÄìEnya languages (?Lengola) *D20a Lega‚ÄìBinja languages *D20‚Äì30 Komo‚ÄìBira languages, (with C40a) Boan *D28 Holoholo (perhaps in NE Bantu) *D30 (unclassified): Guru (Boguru), Ngbinda, Kare (Kari), Nyanga- li (Gbati-ri) *D33 Nyali languages (Beeke? Ngbee?, +Bodo?) *D43‚Äì55 Nyanga‚ÄìBuyi languages *D54 Bembe (with Lega?) D10, D30, and some of D20 and D40 are sometimes considered Forest Bantu, the others Savanna Bantu. Most of D40‚Äì60 has been moved to Great Lakes Bantu languages. Lengola, Bodo, and Nyali may belong together as Lebonya, and Beeke in Boan. Zone E Kenya, apart from Swahili The languages of Zone E have been reassigned: E10‚ÄìE40 to Great Lakes Bantu languages; E50 Kikuyu‚ÄìKamba (Central Kenya Bantu) and E60 Chaga‚ÄìTaita to Northeast Bantu; E70 Nyika to Northeast Bantu, mostly in Sabaki. Zone F W & C Tanzania. *F10 Tongwe-Bende *F30 (reduced) Mbugwe‚ÄìRangi languages *?Isanzu Much of F20 and F30, including the major language Sukuma, have been reclassified as Northeast Bantu, with Bungu to Rukwa and Sumbwa as Great Lakes. Mbugwe‚ÄìRangi, however, form a valid node by themselves. Isanzu is sometimes classified as F30, as a variety of Nilamba, and sometimes thought to be a remnant of the Bantu languages spoken in the area before F-zone languages arrived. Zone G E Tanzania, Comoros *G50 (with Mbunga) Kilombero The languages of Zone G have been reclassified, G60 Bene‚ÄìKinga to Northeast Bantu, and the other branches more specifically to Northeast Coast Bantu languages. Zone H NW Angola, W Congo *H10 (reduced) Kongo languages *H20 Kimbundu languages (?Songo) *H30‚Äì40 (with Yanzi) Yaka languages H10 and H40 are sometimes considered Forest Bantu, the others Savanna Bantu. H10 Kunyi, Suundi, and Vili have been split between B40 and L10. H40 is split between H30 and L10. Kongo‚ÄìYaka may form a family, perhaps with B40 Sira. Zone J Uganda, Rwanda‚ÄìBurundi, near lakes Kivu & Victoria *J Great Lakes (part of Northeast Bantu) Zone K E Angola, W Zambia *K10 Chokwe‚ÄìLuchazi languages *K31 Luyana *K30 Kavango languages? *K43 Mbukushu K20 Lozi is now classified as Southern Bantu. Some K30 languages have been reclassified as Kavango, but Luyana is an independent lineage. K40 Subiya‚ÄìTotela has been reclassified as Botatwe, apart from Mbukushu, which appears to be an independent lineage. Zone L S DR-Congo, C Zambia *L10 (with some H) Pende languages *L20‚Äì40 +L60 Luba languages (Luluwa) *L50 Lunda languages L20 Songe (apart perhaps from Lwalu), L30 Luba, L40 Kaonde, and L60 Nkoya have been grouped as Luban. Zone M E Zambia, SE DR-Congo *M10‚Äì30 (with Bungu) Rukwa languages *M40‚Äì50 (with Senga) Sabi languages *M60 (with K40 Subia) Botatwe languages Sabi‚ÄìBobatwe may be related. Zone N Malawi and surrounding areas, C Mozambique *N20‚Äì40 Nyasa languages N10 Manda has been classified as Rufiji‚ÄìRuvuma, and the N20 Tumbuka 'dialect' Senga as Sabi. Zone P NE Mozambique, SE Tanzania P10 Matuumbi and P20 Yao have been classified as Rufiji‚ÄìRuvuma, P15 Mbunga as Kilombero, P30 Makhuwa as Southern Bantu. Zone R SW Angola, N Namibia, N Botswana *R11 Umbundu (South Mbundu) *R10‚Äì30 Southwest Bantu languages *R40 Yeyi R20 Ovambo, R30 Herero, and R10 apart from Umbundu have been grouped together as Southwest Bantu. Yeyi forms its own lineage. Zone S South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, S. Mozambique. *S10 Shona languages *S20‚Äì60 (with P30) Southern Bantu languages Full list (1948/2009) Following is the original list from Guthrie (1948), with all numerical assignments, as updated by Guthrie himself (1971) and J.F.

Biography De Vecchi was born in Casale Monferrato on 14 November 1884. After graduating in jurisprudence he became a successful lawyer in Turin. His stance on the First World War was interventionist, and he himself took part in the final events of the conflict, finishing the war with the rank of captain and various decorations for valor.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/de-vecchi-cesare-maria_(Dizionario- Biografico)/ On his return to Italy he gave his support to the National Fascist Party, in which he would consistently represent the monarchical and 'moderate' wing. He became president of the Turin war veterans and head of the local Fascist squadre. In 1921, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies. De Vecchi became Commander General of the Milizia (see Blackshirts), was one of the quadrumvirs who organised the March on Rome, and sought to persuade Antonio Salandra to enter into Benito Mussolini's government. He himself became Undersecretary at the Treasury and then at the Finance Ministry. In December 1922 he inspired the squadre of Brandimarte to the 1922 Turin massacre (Strage di Torino) and he became known as the most important of the Piedmontese squadristi. From 1923 to 1928, De Vecchi was governor of Italian Somaliland, a role which took him away from the centre of the Italian political scene. He was made Count of Val Cismon (in memory of the battles fought by his arditi on Monte Grappa in 1918). He was appointed a Senator by King Victor Emmanuel III. He became the first ambassador to the Vatican after the Concordat of 1929. Between 1935 and 1936 he was national Minister of Education: as such he promoted a historiography which identified the House of Savoy as the link between Imperial Rome and the Rome of Fascism, and also worked for the centralisation of the administration of the school system. From 1936 to 1941, De Vecchi acted as governor of the Italian Aegean Islands promoting the official use of the Italian language. In the following year he was appointed to the Grand Council of Fascism and on 25 July 1943, he voted in favour of Dino Grandi's order of the day which deposed Benito Mussolini of his role as Fascist Duce (leader). As a result, he was condemned to death in absentia during the Verona trial conducted under the auspices of the Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, or RSI), but he was able to escape to Argentina on a Paraguayan passport. After returning to Italy in 1949, De Vecchi supported the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano, or MSI) together with Rodolfo Graziani. However, he refused to accept any political or institutional office within the MSI. Cesare Maria De Vecchi died in Rome in 1959.

Russia is a party to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on mines, booby traps, and other devices. In addition to using hand- emplaced mines, Russian forces have also deployed anti-personnel mines from airplanes, helicopters and rockets, resulting in large tracts of mined land that is unmarked and unfenced. Most of this scatterable mining took place in 1999 and 2000. In addition, only half of the cluster munitions dropped in Chechnya actually detonated. Urban areas (including civil buildings in the capital Grozny), villages, roads, fields, woods, mountain paths, bridges and rivers were mined. Eighty percent of minefields were unmarked. The most heavily mined areas are those in which rebels continue to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of Chechnya. No humanitarian mine clearance has taken place since the HALO Trust was evicted in December 1999, after the Russian government accused the organization of espionage and arrested some of their staff. In June 2002, Olara Otunnu, the United Nations Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region. In September 2003 the International Campaign to Ban Landmines reported that almost 6,000 people, 938 of which were children, died or were injured by land mines in Chechnya in 2002, more than anywhere else in the world. It is an especially disturbing figure in a region whose population was less than one million people. On April 4, 2006, UNICEF and European Commission said in a joint statement released in Moscow that over 3,030 people have been maimed or killed by land mines in the course of the second Chechen War (April 4 marked the first International Day for Mine Awareness). UNICEF has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and unexploded ordnance casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003. In March 2007 Chechen government official said that \\"the overall number of people who suffered from mine explosions in Chechnya was 3,067 including 573 women (100 lethal cases), 2,494 men (604 killed) and 754 children including 131 killed in mine blasts.\\" According to Gazeta.ru, more people suffer from mines in Chechnya than in Afghanistan.

In the past, Grande Holdings has purchased several Japanese HiFi manufacturers, including Akai, Nakamichi and Sansui. It also owns Kawa, a Chinese domestic hifi company, and has owned Singer Corporation, a company best known for its sewing machines. The company has since sold off Singer as a brand. History The company was founded by James Ting, a Chinese businessman originally from Shanghai, Christopher Ho, and Stanley Ho (), Macau's richest and most famous entrepreneurs. In 1999 prior to the collapse of International Semi Tech Microsystems, Grande Holdings acquired Singer, Pfaff, Akai and Sansui Electric assets. Singer and Pfaff were later sold off to SVP Worldwide. Controversy In 1999 during the Asian Financial Crisis the company courted controversy when one of its main subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Akai Holdings Ltd, fell apart after recording a $1.65 billion loss in 1999, one of the biggest losses in Asian financial history. It resulted in Grande Holdings becoming almost bankrupt, and having to sell many of its subsidiaries and business interests to recoup its loss. Regulators and officials in the bankruptcy court had found the company's subsidiary, Akai Holdings Ltd, and its Singer division, had made a number of complex company cross-selling deals which resulted in the destabilisation of Singer and Akai. Officials, through their findings, had found Akai's directors and staff had left their Hong Kong offices, and also found that some $38.5 million had mysteriously disappeared from Akai's funds. It was speculated the money was either siphoned away by employees, or deposited in overseas bank accounts. In November 1999, and after the bankruptcy proceedings, many of Akai's remaining assets mysteriously shifted to Grande Holdings, without any notification to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, creditors, courts, or other regulatory authorities. The deal was done through a simple and hastily prepared four-page management agreement. Creditors for Akai say they only learned of the change in corporate ownership in September 2000, when Grande Holdings presented 54 boxes of Akai records to liquidators. Grande Holdings then executive director Samuel K. Yuen denied in a brief telephone interview that Grande had taken over Akai. Grande Holdings today Following a series of losses, Grande had reached insolvency and appointed provisional liquidators on 1 June 2011. At the time of filing, the company controlled the Akai, Nakamichi and Sansui brands as well as its key assets, including a TV factory in Zhongshan, China. The company also owns Ross Group plc, a transformer manufacturer in the United Kingdom, majority ownership of Emerson Radio, and Kawa a Chinese brand of electronics. The company is currently incorporated in Bermuda as an exempted company with limited liability.

The team enjoyed considerable success, winning the MBA National Championship in 2002, the last season of the said league. The team was based in Bacolod, Negros Occidental. History=1998: Formation of the team in The Inaugural Season The team was named \\"Slashers\\" based on the cane knives' slashing motion used by itinerant sugar workers to cut sugarcane stalks. Sugar is the main product of Negros Occidental. Bacolod businessmen Oscar \\"Dodong\\" Bascon and Babes Alvarez painstakingly formed the team composed of amateur standouts mostly from the Visayas-Mindanao leagues and former professional players from Philippine Basketball Association. Ronnie \\"DJ\\" Dejarlo was the first player to sign a contract with the team. Among the players that formed the team were Maui Huelar, Erwin Framo, Johnedel Cardel, John Ferriols, Allen Sasan and Jack Tanuan. Negrense Rolly Buenaflor was named as head coach. The Negros Slashers played their first two games on the road against the Batangas Blades and Manila Metrostars, losing on both occasions despite having a solid team with a mix of veterans and newcomers. Rolly Buenaflor was relieved of head coaching duties shortly after and was replaced by Junel Baculi. But tragedy struck the team on the eve of their third game in Cebu City when their main player, DJ Dejarlo, was found dead in their hotel room due to pancreatitis. Fueled by Dejarlo's unexpected death, the Slashers won their first game against eventual archrival Cebu Gems. Since then, the Slashers found their winning ways and became one of Southern Conference's formidable teams. But Baculi left the team before the second round of eliminations and was replaced by Cebuano coach Jun Noel. The team also signed up Palarong Pambansa standouts Reynel Hugnatan, Ryan Gamboa and Leo Bat-og to bolster their frontline. They were able to barge in the National Playoffs and faced the Cebu Gems in the first Southern Conference Finals, marred by numerous fan incidents on and off court. They won the series 4-3 and went on to face the Pampanga Dragons. But luck worn out on them as the more experienced Dragons (bannered by former PBA MVP Ato Agustin) won the first MBA National Championship. Negros Slashers team captain John Ferriols was named the inaugural season's Most Valuable Player. The Negros Slashers were grouped together with the Cebu Gems, Iloilo Volts, Davao Eagles, Socsargen Marlins and Cagayan de Oro Nuggets in the Southern Conference division. 1999: Sophomore Season Jinx Things looked rosy for the Negros Slashers after winning the Southern Conference crown and finishing runner-up to MBA National Champions Pampanga Dragons. They got the right to host the first MBA All Star game which pitted teams from the North Conference against teams from the Southern Conference. John Ferriols, Jack Tanuan and Johnedel Cardel proudly represented the Slashers for the South team. During the offseason, the management held tryouts for MBA players who were released by their mother teams. Among the new recruits for the Slashers were center Mike Otto, former Iloilo Volts forward Judge Primero, former PBA veterans Romy dela Rosa and Roel Bravo. Former Pangasinan Presidents head coach Robert Sison was also hired as the team's assistant coach for Jun Noel. The second season opened for the Slashers with them hosting the opening ceremonies for the Southern Conference in Bacolod City. However, they were beaten by the new-look Iloilo Megavoltz (headlined by new recruit Vince Hizon) in their first game for the new season. But the Slashers quickly bounced back by winning successive games against their closest rivals. With the Visayas division title at stake, the Slashers tried to qualify for a finals berth but were beaten to it by rivals Cebu Gems and Iloilo Megavoltz, who eventually won the Visayas division crown. During the season's second round of elimination, the Slashers roster underwent a major revamp following the exit of star center Jack Tanuan, who suffered a kidney disease which left him blind in the right eye. The Slashers management traded back-up center Mike Otto to Pasig Rizal Pirates in exchange for bruiser Lito Aguilar, promoted back-up center Reynel Hugnatan to starter status, and recruited 2 Fil-foreigners in 6-1 combo guard Dean Labayen (who was originally scheduled to play for Barangay Ginebra in the PBA) and 6-8 center Dorian Pena. Both players traced their roots to Negros Occidental. But Labayen only played until the first game of the semifinal round as the Bureau of Immigration cracked down on Fil-foreigner players who were found to be fake or lacking work documents. The new-look Slashers were able to bamboozle their way through the elimination round but momentum slipped for them when they faced their archrivals the Cebu Gems in the semifinals. The Gems paraded 6-9 Fil-Am Matt Mitchell as counterpart to Pena. The bigger and more skilled Mitchell teamed up with Cebu's main gunner Dondon Hontiveros to lead the Gems against the Slashers en route to the Southern Conference Finals vs the Iloilo Megavoltz. 2000‚Äì2001: Return to the Finals with a new coach, another Finals heartbreak With the Slashers losing their Southern Conference title to their bitter rivals, changes were in order for the team. They released Lito Aguilar, hometown players Nonoy Sayon and Ryan Gamboa, and Fil-Ams Dean Labayen and Dorian Pena during the offseason. Pena and Gamboa found a home in Pasig Rizal Pirates while Sayon played for archrival Cebu Gems. They signed up free agent guard Dennis Madrid, free agent forward Ruben dela Rosa (also Romy's brother) and acquired forwards Cid White from Nueva Ecija Patriots and Alvin Teng from the Laguna Lakers. A controversial coaching change happened midway in the first round of eliminations when long-time coach Jun Noel was replaced by assistant coach Robert Sison. Although the change was welcomed by most Negros fans, there was a rejection coming from one of the disgruntled owners of the franchise. It almost caused a distraction to the team but eventually the conflict was resolved when Sison started to win games with the team. With the whole team playing inspired basketball the whole season, the Slashers were able to avenge the bitter defeat they experienced in the recent Southern Conference Finals against the Cebu Gems, who were playing without their main man Dondon Hontiveros who already left them for greener pastures with the Tanduay Rhum Masters in the PBA. The Slashers faced a tall team in San Juan Knights in the 3rd MBA National Finals but despite possessing quickness to make up for lack of ceiling, they were overpowered by the Knights in six games. Prior to the season the Slashers were merged with the Iloilo Megavoltz as part of the league's streamlining operations. But unlike other merged teams that had strong lineups (Manila-Batangas had the strongest roster), the Slashers did not took in any players from the Megavoltz team as it disbanded. However, they were able to sign up former Iloilo Megavoltz player Michael Almonte as a free agent. The team also released Alvin Teng. The decision was made owing to his sub-par performance during Game 4 of the MBA Championship Series against the San Juan Knights in 2000 (he was pulled out of that game, sat on the bench, untied his shoelaces and donned his practice jersey), and for not showing up in the following game (he actually called-in sick and did not play). The team relied heavily on its regular rotation of Ferriols, Cardel, Huelar, Bat-og, Hugnatan, brothers Romy and Ruben dela Rosa, White and newly acquired ex-La Salle guard Dino Aldeguer, who was waived by the Alaska Aces. Just like the previous season, the Slashers again handily won the Southern Conference Championship this time against the TPG-Davao Eagles. In their third trip to the MBA National Finals, the Slashers faced the LBC Batangas Blades but lost in four games. 2002: MBA Crossover Champions/National Champions, final season In 2002, TV broadcast partner ABS-CBN withdrew its support and funding for the league. As a result, the league had to be commercialized, allowing teams to look for sponsors. Negros Slashers found one in remittance company RCPI and was renamed the RCPI Negros Slashers, barely 2 weeks before the season started. Robert Sison resigned as head coach and was replaced by Joshua Villapando. The roster underwent a major revamp as long-time Negros Slasher Johnedel Cardel left the team to sign up with expansion team Olongapo Volunteers. New faces in the team included Jose Francisco, Tyrone Bautista and 6-10 former La Salle Green Archer Vincent San Diego. The Slashers became the dominant team in a league that was reeling from heavy financial losses. It was able to capture the MBA First Conference title (dubbed as Crossover Conference) where they exacted revenge on their rival in last year's National Finals, the Batangas Blades. At the same time, their championship was dedicated to their former player, Jack Tanuan who died on April 4, 2002 after battling a kidney disease. The league stopped operations on July 26, 2002 due to continued financial loss. Because there was no MBA National Champion declared for the season, the Crossover Conference championship won by Negros Slashers was considered an official MBA title, making them National Champions by default. Uniforms In the first season, the Slashers was color navy and white were used in 1998 season. In 1999 replaced with color red, navy blue and white in the second season. In 2000, the Slashers was replaced color blue, red and white contains with FedEx logo in the bottom of the Slashers logo. From 2001, the Slashers was color navy blue, blue and white. In the last year 2002, renames RCPI-Negros Slashers in same color.

History Southwell family hang in the entrance hall of Kingsweston House It was built between 1712 and 1719 was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh for Edward Southwell on the site of an earlier Tudor house, remodelled 1763‚Äì1768 by Robert Mylne and again between 1845 and 1850 by Thomas Hopper. A significant architectural feature is the grouping of all the chimneys into a massive arcade. The Kings Weston estate possesses one of the largest collections of buildings designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in the UK. Whilst the house and the majority of the estate buildings are still standing others have been demolished or been heavily altered. Bristol is the only UK city outside London to possess buildings designed by Vanbrugh.Foyle, p. 292 The house passed through several generations of the Southwell family until the estate was sold in 1833 to Mr Philip John Miles for ¬£210,000, and became the family seat. During the World War I the House was converted into a hospital though the house continued as a family home until 1935 when, on the death of Philip Napier Miles, it was auctioned and bought by Bristol Municipal Charities and leased to the education authority for use as a school. It later became the Bristol Technical College School of Architecture which later developed into Bath University School of Architecture. In 1970 Bristol Corporation obtained a 50% grant from the Home Office and purchased the House for ¬£305,000 to set up a Police Training Centre for Bristol Constabulary and was used as such until 1995. It was then abandoned for five years and between 2000 and 2012 was leased from Bristol City Council and partially restored as a Business and Conference Centre by local businessman John Hardy. After April 2011 the lease on Kings Weston House was put on the market for ¬£2 million. Following a short period of closure to the public the house was sold to a new leaseholder, local businessman Norman Routledge in December 2012. Since then the house has been extensively renovated and has opened again as a conference and wedding venue, as well as a communal residence. It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building. Buildings in the grounds include a Loggia, Brewhouse and Echo which are all grade I listed in their own right. The house is surrounded by parkland and an area of woodland bordering the suburbs of Shirehampton, Sea Mills and Lawrence Weston. An iron bridge across Kings Weston Lane connects the estate to that of Blaise Castle. In April 2011 the Kings Weston Action Group (KWAG) was formed as a volunteer organisation with the ambition to conserve and enhance the Grade II Registered Historic Landscape around the house. The remains of the historic park consists of almost 220 acres split in ownership between Bristol City Council and the National Trust whose 93 acres of Shirehampton Park are leased to Shirehampton Golf Club. The whole landscape is accessible as either public park or by public footpaths and includes areas of Common land at Penpole Point. Archives Documents relating to Kings Weston House and estate, and the families that lived there, are held at Bristol Archives (Refs. 42725) (online catalogue), (Ref. 33746) (online catalogue), (Ref. 44955) (online catalogue) and (Ref. Picbox/6/Port/KW) (online catalogue). Other records relating to Kings Weston House are held at Gloucestershire Archives. Before Vanburgh Kip's view of the estate with its previous house Sir Robert Southwell in a painting by Kneller hanging at Kings Weston House Sir Robert Southwell purchased the Kings Weston estate from Humphrey Hooke, a Bristol merchant, in 1679.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 107 In 1712 a birds-eye view of the estate by Johannes Kip was published in Robert Atkyns' The Ancient and Present State of Glocestershire. It showed what appears to be a late Tudor house, with a layout similar to that of the current building, having a three-sided entrance court. Vanbrugh later used part of the old foundations in his rebuilding, as well as retaining some of the old walls and a staircase in one of the turrets that were in the angles of the entrance court, though the staircase was later removed. John Vanbrugh's designs for the house (Ref. 33746) (online catalogue) and Johannes Kip's engraving of the house (Ref. 44955) (online catalogue) still exist and are available to the public at Bristol Archives. The park surrounding the house was extensive. An avenue extended to the southwest, and there were formal parterres to the southeast. The Kip illustration also shows a banqueting house, which survived as a ruin until 1966, when it was destroyed by vandals. An architectural drawing dated 1707 describes it as being 'after the Modell of the Duke of Ormonds at Richmond', and it consisted of two floors, the lower one a workspace and the upper serving as the dining area. Because the building was on a steep slope. both floors were accessible from ground level, and the south facade consisted of a single storey. This south facade was constructed of red rubbing bricks laid in Flemish bond with exceptionally fine jointing, consisting of a little less than 1/16 inch of slaked lime putty. Current buildings The south east or 'Garden' front Kings Weston House entrance front across the lawns Ceiling of the Parlour at Kings Weston House designed by Robert Mylne and plasterwork executed by Thomas Stocking in the 1760s On 29 April Edward Southwell wrote in his journal at Kings Weston \\"Upwards of 60 men preparing stones and digging the foundation of the new house\\"Journals of Edward Southwell 1684-1715 British Library. RP 437/2 and on 16 June 1712 work formally began on building the new house by John Vanbrugh. His client, Edward Southwell, did not desire a house on a monumental scale.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 108 The result was one of Vanbrugh's smaller houses. It is also his severest in style, obtaining high architectural drama by the well judged disposition of elements that are few in number, and simple in their nature.Andrew Foyle, Pevsner Architectural City Guides, Bristol 2004 The exterior of the house would have been at the point of completion in 1717, the date on the contract for one of the parapet vases.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 113 The interior would have been virtually complete by 1719, when the design for inlay on the stair landings was drawn up. Two of the facades have since been remodelled, by Robert Mylne, who remodelled the interior in the 1760s. The stone, which was quarried on the site, was originally ochre in colour but has weathered to an orange-pink.Foyle, p. 291 The arcade formed by linking the chimneys, which rises above the roof, is a notable external feature of the building, reminiscent of the belvederes of Blenheim Palace and producing a 'castle air'. It is square in shape and open on the northeast. The current structure is the result of a rebuilding in 1968, using Bath Stone. The entrance front, on the southwest, has a centre containing six Corinthian pilasters, with those at each side paired to produce three bays, each of which contains a round arched window. The pediment has a central lunette, and each side consists of two bays in which the windows have wide flat surrounds. There are four parapet vases. The steps originally had low flank walls perpendicular to the facade, which were removed in the later remodelling.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 109 On the southeast facade, the centre has a Doric temple front with open pediment, which surrounds the doorway. The centre has an attic as its upper storey, topped by a blocking course with scrolled supports at each end. A design with a pediment was prepared for this front, but is thought never to have been built. Though the only decoration is the rustication on the Doric temple's pilasters, a remarkably rich effect is achieved. The northeast and northwest facades of Vanbrugh's original design were entirely undecorated, and a consequent lack of popular appeal may be the reason why they were largely destroyed in later remodelling.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 110 Vanbrugh's northwest facade consisted of a single flat surface, in which a Venetian window on each floor filled the central space between two shallow projections. Perhaps to improve the view down to Avonmouth, the centre was remodelled by Mylne with a canted bay window, at odds with the tautness of Vanbrugh's overall design of the house, in which all planes were parallel or perpendicular to the walls. On the northeast the wall was moved forward during nineteenth-century remodelling, destroying an aesthetically significant alignment between wall projections and the break in the roof arcade, which had been present in Vanbrugh's design.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 111 Visitors to the house as it stood after the completion of Vanbrugh's design would have first encountered a huge entrance saloon, two stories high.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 112 Beyond this was a stair hall of three storeys in height, with arched openings to the entrance saloon at first-floor height, so that the upper part of the entrance saloon could be seen from within it. These arches were filled in as part of Mylne's remodelling, which though it increased the comfort and charm, reduced the spatial drama. The additional wall space in the entrance saloon was designed to display Southwell's recently inherited collection of ancestral portraits, and Thomas Stocking was employed to execute a scheme of plaster framing for these to Mylne's design.Gomme, Jenner and Bryan, p. 182 A black and white chequered marble floor and a chimneypiece by John Devall were also added to the entrance saloon at this time. OutbuildingsBrewhouse= The Brewhouse The Brewhouse, by Vanbrugh, can be dated, on the grounds that it shows no Palladian influence, to 1718 or earlier. Such features as the huge keystone, set above an arched doorway, and the prominently-silled lunette window above, are typical of Vanbrugh's style. The machicolated arcade across the moulded parapet of the centre is a feature unique to Vanbrugh at this date, also found at Vanbrugh Castle, and is a precocious example of the Gothic Revival. =The Echo= The Echo The Echo is a loggia at the end of the southeast axis of the building, with a facade of four piers of rusticated stonework, of which alternate courses are projecting and vermiculated, It has large vermiculated keystones at the heads of the three arches. It is attributed to Vanbrugh, its features being almost identical to a Vanbrugh design of 1722 for a single archway. =Banqueting loggia= The Loggia before conversion to a private house in 2002 The loggia was added to a pre-existing banqueting house dating from 1705. Vanbrugh's new front turned that axis of the building ninety degrees so it would relate to the main house to the south west and the Great Terrace that provided a long promenade into the woods beyond. Designs for the loggia date to between 1716 and 1720 and drawings of the building exist in both the collections of Bristol Records Office and the Victoria and Albert Museum. =Penpole Lodge= Penpole Lodge by Sir John Vanbrugh circa 1724. 3D reconstruction by the Kings Weston Action Group Several designs exist for this building which was sited at the far extremity of the Kings Weston estate to the west and acted as both an eye-catcher from the house and a belvedere to view ships arriving in the Avon and Severn Estuary. Although a design exists attributed to Colen Campbell it is undoubtedly Vanbrugh's final design that was constructed some time in about 1724. The building took the form of an archway over which was a small room, sometimes referred to as the \\"Breakfasting room\\". After the estate was sold in the 1930s the lodge became derelict and was demolished by Bristol City Council in 1952 though the building was not removed entirely. In 2012 the Kings Weston Action Group cleared the walls and surrounding area so some idea of the scale of the original building can be obtained. =Kingsweston Inn= Enough drawings of Kingsweston Inn exist for this building to the south east of the main house to be attributed to Vanbrugh. A series of sketch drawings in Bristol Record Office titled \\"ale house\\" compare almost exactly with the built dimensions of the former inn. The Inn was heavily rebuilt in the Nineteenth Century and extended outwards to the south east. The inn closed in the early Twentieth Century and the building was converted into several houses; a use it continues to perform today. =Blacksmith's cottage= Former Blacksmith's cottage on Kingsweston Lane. Attributed to Vanbrugh A building on Kingsweston lane bears all the hallmarks of another design by Sir John Vanbrugh though no documentary or illustrative evidence supports this. The building is known to have existed by 1720 and demonstrates a number of characteristic design features employed by Vanbrugh. The building was in use as a blacksmith's forge and cottage in 1772; a use for which the building may have been designed. =Stables and Kitchen gardens= Kings Weston stables designed by Robert Mylne in 1763 The complex of stables and kitchen gardens at Kings Weston were devised by Edward Southwell III who was already making plans whilst on the Grand Tour between 1759 and 1762. Robert Mylne was studying in Rome when Southwell visited and the pair may well have met there prior to Mylne's engagement on the detailed designs for the stable buildings in 1763. The Stables are noted in Mylne's diaries, now held in the Library of the RIBA, as having been begun in 1763. The whole of the extensive matrix of kitchen gardens, stables, accommodation pavilions and a large square pond are executed to a single unified design. The stables are located on the north side of Napier Miles Road and a large glasshouse and yards were laid out either side of them. An ice house was added later. To the south of the road a series of enclosed walled gardens were laid out surrounding a square pond that replaced an earlier horse pond. The pond was partially ornamental, but served a variety of practical uses including the keeping of fish, provision of a constant water supply to the gardens and ice in the winter, and the washing of horses and carriages by means of access ramps to water level. In 1938 the House in the Garden was built at the centre of the walled gardens for the widowed Sybil Miles (n√©e Gonne) when Kings Weston House and much of the estate were sold. The house and walled gardens south of the road are now part of Kingsweston Special School. After a protracted period of decay the stables were proposed for demolition in 1958. After a local campaign they were saved and Bristol Constabulary rebuilt them to create a Police Station which opened in 1960. In 1954 the medieval Bewys Cross was moved from its location north of Napier Miles Road to a new position beside the pond. The cross is thought to have been brought to the Kings Weston estate from its original location close to the mouth of the Avon in the nineteenth century. The stables and pavilions are an early example of neo-classical architecture and are particularly important in the context of the city of Bristol. The walled gardens and pavilions, and the ice house are on the Heritage at Risk Register whilst the stables have planning permission for conversion to houses. =Shirehampton Lodge= There are five of the original six lodges remaining at the entrance points onto the Kings Weston Estate; Henbury Lodge, Park Lodge, Home Lodge, Wood Lodge, and Shirehampton Lodge. Penpole Lodge was demolished in 1952. All the remaining lodges are grade II listed. Of the remaining five Shirehampton Lodge on Park Hill is the most architecturally ambitious and can be attributed to Robert Mylne who worked elsewhere on the estate for the Southwell family. The building has a portico carried on four Roman Doric columns and a gate once closed off Park Hill before it. Although there are no specific mentions to the lodge in Mylne's diary it may be the \\"lodge and tea room\\" mentioned as his last design work Kings Weston in 1768 which he \\"made a gift\\" of to Edward Southwell. Shirehampton Lodge strongly resembles similar buildings designed by Mylne as bridge-keepers lodges on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. The Estate View south across the Avon from the Shirehampton Park area of the Kings Weston Estate View of Vanbrugh's Echo pavilion showing a temporary replica of the lost statue at the centre The Kings Weston Estate is a Registered Historic Landscape and is protected with a Grade II listing on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. Parts of the landscape lie within the Kingsweston and Trym Valley Conservation Areas defined by Bristol City Council. Much of the landscaped parkland around Kings Weston House remains open and is accessible by the public. 220 acres around the house including Penpole Wood and the Home Park are in the ownership of Bristol City Council with a further 90 Acres including the Shirehampton Park portion of the estate is owned by the National Trust. The landscaped grounds developed during the seventeenth century following the purchase of the manor by Sir Robert Southwell in 1679. Robert keenly redesigned the formal gardens with the assistance of John Evelyn including the creation of parterre and 'wilderness' gardens, formal avenues and the laying out of drives through the woodland. Robert's son Edward continued working on the landscape setting to the house following the completion of the new building in about 1720. Bristol Record Office holds a series of drawings illustrating projects to enhance the gardens. This included the construction of Penpole Lodge, the removal of thirty feet of hillside from Kingsweston Hill, and several projects for \\"Longcombe\\". The latter show that Edward Southwell was extending the designed landscape southwards to cover the area now known as Shirehampton Park. Thomas Wright is recorded as having been engaged in redesigning the landscape in conjunction with Edward Southwell III immediately on the return of the latter to England from the Grand Tour in 1762. Letters now lodged at Bristol Record Office detail a close friendship between Wright and his client. In a journal entry in 1783 John Wesley described \\"Lord Clifford's woods at King's Weston\\" as \\"amazingly beautiful: I have seen nothing equal to them in the West of England, and very few in other parts\\".Journal entry for Thursday 24 August 1783 in After a subsequent visit he noted the house to be \\"one of the most beautiful I ever saw ... the prospect is fine every way commanding both the land and the water\\".Journal entry for Saturday 27 October 1788 in By the turn of the nineteenth century the estate was nationally famous for what a contemporary guide to the seats of the gentry called its \\"exquisitely beautiful and uncommonly extensive\\" prospect northwards across the Severn Estuary to Wales and southwards over the River Avon towards the Avon Gorge and Bristol. It formed the climax of well- published rides from fashionable resorts such as Bath,e.g. - but Warner found the house disgusting to the eye and thought the view could have been improved by judicious planting. Clifton and Hotwells returning across Kingsweston Hill, Blaise Castle Estate and Westbury on Trym. Jane Austen has characters of hers talk of excursions to the estate in Northanger AbbeyJohn Thorpe in and in EmmaMrs Elton in (but in both cases those characters are generally depicted as foolish by the author). It also became a popular destination for artists of the Romantic Movement attracting the likes of James Muller, Francis Danby and Nicholas Pococke. Poets including Robert Southey and Walter Savage Landor also visited and wrote about the spectacle of the distant views of Wales from Kingsweston Hill and Penpole Point. Much of the former charm of Kings Weston has since been overshadowed by the development of the industrial suburb of Avonmouth to the north and the construction of the Lawrence Weston housing estate in the years following the Second World War. Further decay has resulted from the loss of views through lack of regular maintenance allowing self- seeded trees and shrubs to inundate formerly open slopes. However the Shirehampton Park section of the estate has fared better with the views towards the Avon Gorge remaining unobstructed. Kings Weston Action Group Volunteers of the Kings Weston Action Group record the ruins of Penpole Lodge on the Kings Weston estate The Kings Weston Action Group or KWAG is a volunteer organisation established in April 2011 and focussed on the promotion, conservation and enhancement of the historic former parkland surrounding Kings Weston House in North Bristol. An exhibition of the history of the Kings Weston estate held in the Echo in September 2011 The Kings Weston Action Group was set up to \\"protect the Kings Weston Estate and House, fight for its future, and protect its past\\". It was formed by a group of volunteers formed from local people, users of the parkland, and professionals interested in the conservation of the Grade II-registered historic landscape park and the Grade I listed house. The group was established after the announcement of the sale of the Grade I-listed house and the recognition that the condition of the landscaped grounds in the ownership of Bristol City Council were in an advanced state of decay and in urgent need of conservation. 'The Echo', a pavilion designed by Sir John Vanbrugh The group's objectives are initially stated as to lobby the City Council to engineer a conservation and management plan for the estate, to monitor the Grade I-listed house and garden buildings, and to source funding to develop the grounds into a first-class green space for everyone to enjoy. A new conservation plan was commissioned by the City Council following pressure from the Kings Weston Action Group and was supported by a grant from the Bristol Buildings Preservation Trust in October 2011. KWAG was launched in spring 2011 with an appeal for information that could lead to the recovery of a lost statue and has put on a number of exhibitions, learning events and campaigns. Since January 2012, it also runs regular monthly working party events focussed on taking direct action to help conserve the estate with the support of Bristol City Council and the National Trust. KWAG has produced exhibition material based on its discoveries. Additional information was published in the form of a walking guide to promote the estate in 2012 and was launched at one of the group's regular walking tours. Several archaeology projects have been undertaken by the group with the input of volunteers including a geophysical survey in conjunction with the University of Bristol and the recording of the ruins of Penpole Lodge, a lost building by Sir John Vanbrugh, in conjunction with officers from South Gloucestershire Council.

It was built in 1739 by John Wesley and is the oldest Methodist chapel in the world. Above the chapel are the rooms in which Wesley and other preachers stayed. The chapel includes a double decker pulpit, which was common at the time, and an octagonal lantern window to reduce the amount paid in Window tax. In addition to meetings and worship, the New Room was used as a dispensary and schoolroom for the poor people of the area. The pews and benches were made from old ship timber. The Baldwin and Nicholas Street Methodist groups combined to form the United Society, which met at the New Room from 3 June 1739.K Morgan, John Wesley and Bristol, University of Bristol (Bristol branch of the Historical Association), 1990 Wesley insisted that meetings at the New Room should only be held outside of Anglican church hours as he wanted Methodism to complement rather than compete with Anglican worship. New Room interior The courtyards around the building contain statues of John Wesley and his brother Charles. In 1748 it was extended, possibly by the Quaker George Tully because of the stylistic similarities with the Friends' Meeting House at Quakers Friars of the same period. Wesley believed that liturgical worship should be carried out in churches, and only reluctantly allowed the enlarged New Room to comply with the Toleration Act of 1689 making it a formal place of worship. John Wesley lived at the New Room from 1748 to 1771 and administered sacrament there when his brother Charles Wesley was away. Wesley added to the Methodist offer in Bristol by selling his published works from a bookstore in the New Room. Analysis of the complete printed output of Bristol between 1695 and 1775 shows that over half was written by Methodists. After Wesley's death the property passed into the hands of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists. In 1929 it was given back to the Methodist Church. The John Snetzler Chamber Organ of 1761 is a 20th-century addition following the restoration of the building in 1929 by Sir George Oatley. It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building, and is the only piece of land in Broadmead for which the freehold has not been bought by Bristol City Council during expansion after World War II. A garden in the Broadmead Courtyard was opened on 24 May 2011 by the Lord Mayor of Bristol. This was followed by the opening of the Horsefair Visitor Centre on 13 July 2017 by the Duke of Gloucester. The new facilities include a cafe, library and archive and conference and education facilities plus an expanded museum in the preachers' rooms above the chapel.

Agent XXX) is a fictional character in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, portrayed by Barbara Bach. In the film, Amasova is an agent of the KGB. Biography After the theft of a submarine, M recalls Bond from a mission where he is currently in a cabin located in Austria (in the novelisation, on the Aiguille du Mort, a mountain near the town of Chamonix). While leaving Bond is ambushed by a Russian team, but is able to kill one of them in self-defense prior to parachuting off the mountain. Unbeknownst to Bond, the agent he killed is Amasova's lover Sergei Barsov. She has also been recalled from a mission by General Gogol of the KGB. Anya meets Bond during a show at the Pyramids in Egypt, where her thugs fight with Bond when she believes he has killed Fekkesh, an Egyptian contact whose body has been found in one of the pyramids. The real killer was Jaws. However, they become formally introduced to one another in Cairo when they both arrive at Max Kalba's club. After spouting various biographical details to each other (for example, Anya is aware of Bond's doomed marriage), they attempt to outbid one another for a secret microfilm. When Kalba is killed by Jaws, they travel across Egypt tracking the microfilm. After Anya ultimately outwits Bond for the microfilm (but Bond had reviewed it), they report to the Abu Simbel temple where Gogol and M have decided to work together to find out how and why their submarines are being stolen while at sea. For most of the film Bond and Anya have the same mission objectives and try to achieve the same goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for bed in her carriage, having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight Jaws is despatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as Bond's wife. Afterwards Anya learns that 007 killed her lover. She then tells Bond that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete. Anya is later captured by Stromberg and held captive at Atlantis, Stromberg's undersea base. Bond sneaks aboard and rescues her. As the mission reaches its end, she points her gun at Bond, only to discover that she is too in love with him to kill him. Anya (pointing gun at Bond), tells him: \\"The mission is over, Commander\\". At that moment, as Anya is tightening her finger on the trigger, the cork pops off of a champagne bottle that Bond is in the process of opening. Anya smiles, stifling a giggle, and Bond says \\"In my country, Major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request\\" to which she says \\"Granted\\". Bond then suggests that they get out of their wet clothes. When the escape pod with James and Anya goes into the ship Bond saved from Stromberg's 'instruments of Armageddon', Q, M, and Anya's superiors from Russia look inside a window at James and Anya making love in the luxury bed in awe. \\"James!\\" Anya says as she's the first one in the pod to see the duo's superiors. It was planned to have Amasova make a cameo in Moonraker (which was released in 1979), as the woman in bed with General Gogol, but this never happened. Reception Entertainment Weekly ranks Amasova as the fifth best Bond girl.The 10 Best Bond Girls The 10 Best Bond Girls Fandango ranks her as part of their best Bond Girls. Allwomenstalk named her as the fourth sexiest Bond girl. About.com ranked Amasova as number seven in their list of best Bond girls. Bond-Girls.net called Amasova \\"one of the sexiest and most beautiful Bond-Girls...a brand-new type of Bond-Girl\\". Critical studies In Shaken & Stirred: The Feminism of James Bond, scholar Robert A. Caplen argues that Anya's character \\"is groundbreaking within the Bond Girl paradigm\\" because she is \\"imbued with a plausibility that surpasses her predecessors . . . .\\"Caplen, Robert A., Shaken & Stirred: The Feminism of James Bond (2012), pp. 309.

The Red Army overran 52.1% of territory of Poland with over 13,700,000 inhabitants. The Soviet occupation zone included 5.1 million ethnic Poles (ca. 38%), 37% Ukrainians, 14.5% Belarusians, 8.4% Jews, 0.9% Russians and 0.6% Germans. There were also 336,000 refugees who escaped to eastern Poland from areas already occupied by Germany ‚Äì most of them Polish Jews numbering at around 198,000..

The Jews of the town, at that time, were 40% of the town's population some 500 people. Pogrom On the night of 4 and 5 July 1941, a small group of men armed with axes and iron clubs murdered several dozens of the Jewish inhabitants of WƒÖsosz. The killings were performed in a brutal manner, regardless of the victims' age or sex.Shared History, Divided Memory: Jews and Others in Soviet-occupied Poland 1939-1941, edited by Elazar Barkan, Elizabeth A.

Fifteen surviving Jews remained in the town until 1 July 1942, when they were moved to the Milbo estate where some 500 Jews were employed in various works. In November 1942 the survivors were moved to the Bogusze transit camp and from there onward to Treblinka extermination camp and Auschwitz concentration camp.

Early years Charles Howard was born, according to his enlistment record, in about 1842 in Rockingham County, Virginia. Little is known of his early life. He is probably the Charles Howard recorded in the 1870 census in Portsmouth, Ohio.1870 Census, Scioto Co., Ohio (Microcopy 593 Roll 1265 p. 553), National Archives. On June 16, 1875, Howard decided to enlist in the army, going into a recruiting office in Cleveland, Ohio. His enlistment papers describe the thirty-three-year-old man as 5 foot 5 inches tall, with hazel eyes, brown hair and a dark complexion. From Cleveland, he was sent to Newport Barracks, Kentucky for orientation. A musician by trade, Recruit Howard was assigned to the Fourth Infantry Band.Special Order #137, dated Aug. 20, 1875, Headquarters, General Recruiting Service. He was sent to Fort Omaha, Nebraska, headquarters of the Department of the Platte, and then left with 158 other new recruits aboard a Union Pacific train for Carter Station in southwest Wyoming. From there, the detachment of recruits marched the eleven miles south to Fort Bridger, headquarters of the Fourth Infantry, where they arrived on the afternoon of September 10, 1875.Register of Enlistments, U.S. Army, vol. 74 p. 91 (microcopy 233 roll 39); Regimental Returns and Muster Rolls, 4th Infantry, National Archives. Fort Bridger Photographers had been passing through this frontier military post since almost the inception of the art form. Daguerreotypist John Wesley Jones visited the garrison in 1851 and Samuel C. Mills, traveling with the Army bound for Utah, produced at least one image of Fort Bridger in 1858. Salt Lake City photographer Charles W. Carter came during the winter of 1866‚Äì67 and his former mentor, Charles Savage, visited a number of times between 1866 and the early 1870s. The noted Union Pacific Railroad photographer Andrew J. Russell also stopped here in 1869. Census records show a photographer named Simeon Pierson at the post in 1870. Fort Bridger had a long tradition of photographers at the post. It is not known if Private Howard had previously trained as a photographer or if he acquired his skills after arriving at Fort Bridger, but by the summer of 1876, he was actively producing photographs of the post and the surrounding area. He created landscape views of the Black River Valley and of nearby Church Buttes in the Green River badlands, as well as views of the fort itself. Private Howard also produced portraits. Captain William H. Bisbee, Fourth Infantry, sent a payment for photographs of his child to Howard through the post trader at Fort Bridger, complaining that \\"they are not at all good.\\" Two tintypes, bearing the name \\"C. Howard, Artistic Photographer, Fort Bridger, Wy. Ty.\\" have survived, examples of this soldier-photographer's portraiture work.Bisby to Carter, 1876, private collection. Carter Collection, Wyoming State Archives. Life for Private Howard at Fort Bridger was probably typical of the experience of most soldiers stationed at frontier posts. Private Howard's duty with the regimental band however did afford him a few privileges and an occasional opportunity to travel off the garrison. In July 1876, for example, he and other bandsmen were invited to Ogden, Utah Territory, to perform at a town celebration. Private Howard was then granted three days leave in Salt Lake City. Here he could have obtained additional photography supplies at establishments such as the Art Bazaar, the studio of the noted photographer Charles Savage, before returning to Fort Bridger.

Stanton, Chief Engineer for the Department of the Platte, began preparations for his continued work mapping the major roads in Nebraska and Wyoming. Hearing of Private Howard, Stanton wrote to the commanding officer at Fort Bridger requesting the services of the soldier. \\"I have thought it would be an excellent opportunity to get a set of photographic views of the posts and the most characteristic features in the scenery of the regions visited,\\" Stanton wrote, \\"including views in the Black Hills and at the large Indian encampments.\\" The engineering officer also noted that the photographic expedition might also be \\"to the advantage and perhaps profit of the man himself.\\"Stanton to Flint, June 14 and June 15, 1877, Press Copies of Letters Sent, Chief of Engineers Records, Department of Platte (RG 393), National Archives. Private Howard was detailed for duty with the expedition, departing Fort Bridger on June 27, 1877. His camera, chemicals and developing equipment were forwarded to Cheyenne shortly afterward, where the expedition assembled on July 5 to make final preparations for their departure. In Cheyenne, Howard produced his first photographs of the expedition, including a view of the Cheyenne Army Depot. From this collection of warehouses, army supplies were unloaded from rail cars and shipped overland to military posts throughout Wyoming. He also made a least four images at nearby Fort D. A. Russell. Stanton's expedition departed on July 11, mapping the road north towards the Black Hills.Details of the expedition's movements is based on \\"Annual Report of Captain W. S. Stanton, Corps of Engineers, for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1878,\\" Annual Report of the Secretary of War, Appendix RR, serial set volume 1846 (Washington, D.C., 1875. Second Cavalry Camp near Fort Fetterman, Wyoming Territory. Photograph by Private Charles Howard, September 1877. Courtesy Signal Corps Collection (RG 111), Still Pictures Branch, National Archives. The expedition spent two weeks at Fort Laramie and then continued north, arriving in Deadwood on August 11. The expedition then surveyed the road west from Deadwood. Shortly after crossing into eastern Wyoming, the expedition camped near Sun Dance Hill, near present Sundance, Wyoming. Several members of the survey part climbed to its summit and Private Howard photographed the prominent landmark. The expedition arrived at Cantonment Reno (Fort McKinney) on August 26, where Howard produced several photographs of the post and its buildings. The expedition then headed south to Fort Fetterman. Arriving on September 4, Howard also produced images of this post. The expedition then headed south to Rock Creek Station on the Union Pacific Railroad and then returned to Fort Laramie. The Stanton Expedition next traveled to Camp Robinson and the Red Cloud Agency, arriving on September 30 just over three weeks after the famed Oglala war leader Crazy Horse had been fatally bayonetted. Private Howard produced some of his most important images of the expedition during their four days at Camp Robinson. He appears to have also made a quick trip to nearby Camp Sheridan and the Spotted Tail Agency. The expedition then headed north to the Black Hills again, this time mapping the northern extension of the Sidney-Deadwood trail. They returned along another Black Hills trail, arriving back at Camp Robinson on October 25, the same day that the Oglala left the Red Cloud Agency for their new home on the Missouri River, escorted by two companies of the Third Cavalry. With winter rapidly descending on the northern Great Plains, the Stanton Expedition departed Camp Robinson on October 28, heading south to Sidney Barracks through four to six inches of snow. The weary party arrived in Sidney on November 2 where Private Howard produced one of his final photographs of the expedition. After four months in the field, the soldiers had mapped some thirteen hundred miles of trails through western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming and the Black Hills of Dakota Territory. \\"I have made quite a collection of negatives this season,\\" Private Howard wrote to a friend at Fort Bridger, \\"but had a pretty rough trip of it.\\"Private Charles Howard to James Carter, dated \\"Sydney\\", Neb., Nov. 3, 1877, Carter Papers, private collection. Following the disbandment of the expedition, Private Howard was ordered to accompany Captain Stanton back to Department Headquarters in Omaha where the soldier remained for some eight months, printing his photographs. By early 1878, he had opened his own photographic studio on Douglas Street in Omaha and began selling his images as large format prints, stereoviews and carte-de-vistas. His catalog printed on the back of his stereoviews listed 78 different images for sale. While in Omaha, Howard apparently met another photographer named D. S. Mitchell who had recently established the Great Western Photograph Publishing Company with his partner, Joseph H. McGowan. The name of the firm soon changed from Mitchell & McGowan to Mitchell, McGowan & Company, suggesting that other photographers became part of the partnership. Based on the fact that the company began printing Howard's views as a set of 43 stereocards called \\"Military Posts and Indian Views\\", Private Howard probably joined the firm for a short time. Mitchell's photographic company broke up in the summer and fall of 1878. McGowan moved to North Platte while Mitchell opened a new portrait gallery of his own called the Bee Hive Studio on Sixteenth Street in Omaha. Lacking funds to continue his survey of military roads, Captain Stanton decided not to attempt another summer of field work and released Private Howard from his service in Omaha, sending him back to his old regiment.

Denver Public Library Fort Sanders In July 1878, Private Howard was transferred back to his original assignment with the Fourth Infantry Band, now stationed at Fort Sanders near Laramie, Wyoming. At his new assignment, Howard set up another portrait gallery and produced images for the officers, men and their families stationed at the post. He also reprinted some of Mitchell, McGowan & Company original images, suggesting that he may have kept some of the negatives when the partnership was dissolved. One surviving image bears the imprint of \\"Howard & Johnston, Fort Sanders, Wyoming Territory, suggesting that Howard took on a partner. This may be William J. Johnston, a Canadian who came to Wyoming in 1880 and established a portrait studio in Green River. This may be the same Johnston who later joined Charles S. Baker in Evanston, Wyoming, to produce a series of prints of Shoshone, Arapaho and Apache portraits. Private Charles Howard completed his enlistment and was discharged from the Army in June 1880.Register of Enlistments, loc. cit.; Federal census for 1880, Fort Sanders, Albany Co., Wyoming (T9 roll 1454 p. 54B), National Archives.

American Heritage Center. Native American Photographs While the majority of Private Howard's surviving images can best be described as outdoor views, including landscapes, he did produce a small number of photographs of Native Americans. All of his surviving Indian photographs were taken outdoors, as opposed to within a studio setting. His earliest is an image of an unidentified Indian, presumably Shoshone, wrapped in a blanket outside Judge Carter's post trader store at Fort Bridger, circa 1875‚Äì1877. The majority of his Native American views are from the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail Agencies, located in northwestern Nebraska, taken in October 1877 while he was part of the Stanton Expedition. He produced a number of views of Indian camps as well as images of prominent Lakota leaders outside their lodge. He photographed Spotted Tail, White Thunder and Two Strike, all prominent Brule headmen. Of the Minneconjou and Sans Arc leaders who had recently surrendered at the Spotted Tail Agency, he was able to photograph Touch the Clouds, Red Bear and Roman Nose. The famed Oglala war leader Crazy Horse had been killed three weeks prior to Private Howard's visit, but the photographer did capture at least two images of Crazy Horse's scaffold grave, located on a bluff overlooking Camp Sheridan. On his printed list of available views pasted on the back of his stereocards (circa. 1878), Howard advertised that he also had \\"Numerous Pictures 'Card Size' of Indians of Different Tribes.\\" Many of these may actually be reprints of the work of other photographers.

England began the tournament the stronger side, defeating Wales 4‚Äì0 in Cardiff. Ireland too began well, beating the fancied Scots in a close game in Belfast. In the second round England took the lead with a thumping 8‚Äì3 victory over Ireland at home, in which Jimmy Greaves and Terry Paine both scored hat- tricks.

He won the gold medal in the welterweight division at the 1928 Summer Olympics, despite competing throughout the tournament with a dislocated knuckle in his left hand. This was the first gold medal won for an athlete representing New Zealand.  1928 Olympics  Tim Tracey had been training Morgan in the build up for the 1928 Olympic games in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, due to the elongated travel times athletes from NZ faced in attending the Olympics, Morgan put on weight. He was three pounds over the lightweight division limit and therefore had to fight up in the welterweight grade; often giving up to 9 pounds away to his opponents. Leading up to the games he dislocated his knuckle on his left hand sparring with European professional Ernie Rice. Morgan was a southpaw which caused even greater problems. Morgan was regarded by many as one of the best fighters at the games, despite throwing very few left handed punches.  1928 Olympic tournament results  * Round of 16: defeated Selfrid Johansson (Sweden) by a second-round knockout * Quarterfinal: defeated Romano Caneva (Italy) by decision * Semifinal: defeated Robert Galataud (France) by decision * Final: defeated Raul Landini (Argentina) by decision (won gold medal)  Background  Morgan was born in London, England, but his family moved to New Zealand when he was one year old. There he attended Te Aro School and Wellington College, but dropped out in 1922 and started working as a plumber. A plaque at Wellington College was erected in his honor. Morgan was the New Zealand Amateur Lightweight Champion in 1925 and 1927. He won 26 out of his 28 amateur bouts. In July 1929 he turned professional, but with a little success, winning 13 and losing 11 out of 26 bouts. In 1931 he won three minor matches in the United States and the New Zealand welterweight title, knocking out Reg Trowern in second round. He retired in October 1934 after losing to Don Stirling in a welterweight title fight and later worked as a plumber and boxing referee. Morgan was offered the chance to turn pro after the Olympics but turned it down. He later regretted the decision saying he needed to have turned pro overseas where the \\"game was bigger\\". Morgan's gold medal is one of the biggest example of overcoming adversity and is one of the least well known NZ Olympic stories. http://www.triobooks.co.nz/our-olympic-centure/  Family  On 12 April 1933 he married sprinter Norma Wilson, who also competed at the 1928 Olympics, but they divorced in 1938. Morgan remarried on 10 November 1945, to Jannet Elizabeth Reynolds; they had a son and a daughter.  Death  Although he was a non-smoker, Morgan died from lung cancer in Wellington due to the inhalation of fumes while working as a plumber. In 1990 he was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.

The plot revolves around the consequences of a superhero, John Horus, who kills the President of the United States and several of his advisers after discovering them to be war criminals.Black Summer #0 The following seven issues detail the aftermath of the assassination.Summer Time...Black Warren Ellis on Black Summer , Newsarama, 22 March 2007 Black Summer is regarded as the first series in Warren Ellis's Avatar-published \\"Superhuman Trilogy\\" dealing with the creation of superheroes. The subsequent series being No Hero, and Supergod. Prior to Supergod's release, Warren Ellis said in an interview that, \\"Black Summer was about superhumans who were too human. No Hero was about superhumans who were inhuman. Supergod is about superhumans who are no longer human at all, but something else. The third leg of a thematic trilogy if you like.\\" Plot synopsis The Seven Guns, led by scientist-inventor Tom Noir, are a posthuman superhero team who have made a reputation for opposing corrupt political institutions. John Horus, the strongest member of the team, assassinates the President of the United States for his allegedly criminal policies, telling the nation that he was the only person in a position to stop him. As martial law is declared, Frank Blacksmith, once Tom's partner and the co-founder of the Seven Guns -- having previously faked his death to work for the CIA -- comes out of hiding to hunt down and eliminate Tom and the Guns. The remaining Guns, all branded as fugitives by the government, try to cope with the aftermath of the assassination while trying to keep internal tensions from boiling over. After Tom is killed in a battle with the U.S. military, the Guns furiously massacre the soldiers and resolve to kill John Horus. Horus, having repelled attacks from fighter jets and a nuclear missile, threatens to destroy the country in retaliation for Tom's death. Frank Blacksmith is given approval to unleash his covert \\"Tactical Stream\\" of super soldiers, which engage the Guns at their old base. Issue 6 The battle between the remaining Four Guns and Frank Blacksmith's Tactical Stream is underway. One of them strikes down Dom and kills him, saying \\"Frank Blacksmith says hello, you piece of shit\\". Meanwhile, John starts razing the base but the general stands down his troops in order both to save their lives and to get John talking. He convinces John that Tom had died by suicide and not at the hands of his troops. He and his troops are then killed in a massive surprise Tactical Stream attack on John which destroys even more of the city. Zoe, Kathryn and Angela have managed to dispose of their assailants and witness the mushroom cloud explosion of the attack on John. Issue 7 John Horus fends off his attackers despite the loss of several of his \\"eyes\\". The three women of the team interrupt them, telling both John and the Tactical Stream that they're banished from the city when done fighting. They then resolve to stay out of any further conflict but devote themselves to saving the lives of survivors in the largely ruined city. John eliminates the remainder of his attackers and leaves to find Blacksmith at Laura Tarrant's grave, which has been disturbed. They argue over who disturbed it and who is the true hero. Tom Noir reveals himself, alive and well (\\"I'm not as fast as Zoe, but I'm still pretty fast\\") taking both men to task for \\"fucking it up\\" and ruining the original dream of the Seven Guns. He reveals that he dug up Laura's grave for her gun and activates a failsafe which he had included in it at Laura's request, killing them all in a massive blast. As the smoke clears a prerecorded message, one which Tom Noir had set to broadcast while waiting for the meeting (\\"waiting here to kill my oldest friend\\"), airs over every radio in the country, giving Tom's version of events, exonerating (as much as possible) the surviving Guns and promising, as the book ends, to elaborate on Frank Blacksmith's story and give comprehensive evidence of unspecified \\"war crimes committed by our government.\\" Before proceeding with these, Tom closes the book out with his explanation that John had to be killed \\"because he cared too much about saving the day.\\" Main characters=Kathryn Artemis Before her enhancements, Kathryn was a world-class athlete and marksman. She customised her enhancements by incorporating her motorcycle into the transformation, becoming an armoured motorcyclist. Unlike the other members, her background was in history rather than science, and she felt no qualms about killing criminals. Her Gun appears capable of firing scattered bursts that destroy multiple targets. Her keyword, Miyamoto, is the Japanese surname of Miyamoto Musashi. John Horus The most well known and publicly active member of the Seven Guns, Horus is also the most powerful. Until he killed the president and everyone in the Oval Office, he was the most publicly trusted member of the team, and was often a guest of the President. John benefits from the enhancements pioneered by the other Guns: Blacksmith's offensive gun, Angela's flight system, and Tom Noir's baseline augmentations. John's personal contribution was a customisation of his Gun. Instead of a handgun-shaped weapon attachment, his Gun is a swarm of eye-shaped floating devices that function as an offensive and defensive weapons platform, making him virtually invincible. The eyes have shown the capacity to withstand several nuclear payloads, and Tom Noir says that Horus \\"could build cities out of mud\\" with his enhancements. He dresses in white clothes that resemble an officer's outfit from the US Civil War, but with Masonic symbols, or Eye of Ra sigils. He also carries on an Ellis trademark, a reluctant hero who wears all white (see Jenny Sparks and Elijah Snow). Keyword unknown. Dominic Atlas Hyde The muscle of the team. At the time of the events of the series, Dominic has assumed the duties of mechanic, maintaining the team's equipment. Dominic possesses various implants allowing him to remotely control the team's computer equipment in addition to the baseline augmentations. When activated, his enhancements utilise \\"smart fullerene\\" to cover his body in massive black body armour and artificial muscle mass. His keyword, Herakles, refers to the legendary demigod. Zoe Jump Zoe uses the Millis Bias Field to distort physical laws, giving her superhuman speed. Zoe theorised that if she could mentally encompass, in one instant, the complex mathematical equations describing such a Field, she could project such a field around herself. With help from Tom Noir, she created and installed cybernetic eye implants to project the information onto her field of vision. She is able to extend the field around herself to a limited degree, so that a single person running in tandem with her can achieve the same speed. Zoe shows serious misgivings regarding the use of lethal force. Tom Noir Real Name: Tom Watson. Considered the \\"brains\\" of the Seven Guns, Tom Noir helped theorise the Gun technology that would empower the group. He worked closely with Frank Blacksmith to develop the Guns. Tom's Gun enhancements include a \\"supercortex\\" that allows him to perceive and process all available information streams, including decryption, and very precise ultrasound imaging technology. He is able to see directly into any target with surgical precision through outer layers of clothing, weapons, devices, as well as bones and internal organs. This vision also allows him to find vital points and weaknesses. His Gun is named Inquiry, and fires surgical tungsten rounds that can penetrate a tank. Tom also covers his right arm in some kind of techno-organic looking armour while fighting the government assassin sent to kill him. Keyword: Bakerstreet. The keyword is an allusion to Sherlock Holmes, the fictional detective whose address in London was 221b Baker Street. His Gun, Inquiry, also follows in this motif, alluding to Holmes's inquisitive mind, and fitting of Watson's role as the \\"brains\\" of the group. More than a year ago, Tom lost part of his left leg below the knee in the explosion that killed Laura Tarrant. After her death, Tom quit the group and became an alcoholic shut-in, living in a squalid apartment and drinking himself to death. Despite this, he was targeted first for termination after Horus' execution of the President. Frank Blacksmith believes that his genius-level intellect, which helped create the Gun technology Blacksmith now uses to empower his government agents, makes him, out of all his teammates, the most dangerous potential asset for John Horus. Angel One Angel One, real name Angela, can levitate and 'fly' by superconductor based magnetic levitation using systems surgically implanted in her legs, and possibly other parts of her torso. The effect works better in highly metallic environments, so better in urban areas than rural or wilderness. A Keyword, Daedalus, which refers to the Greek myth of Daedalus the inventor who constructed, among other things, wings of wood and wax to escape imprisonment on Crete with his son Icarus (who died upon flying too close of the sun, melting the wax of his wings). Laura Torch In civilian life, her name was Laura Tarrant. Although deceased by the time of the story's events, Laura has played a pivotal role in the current state of the team. A caring and compassionate person, she had worried that the power which the group wielded would one day be misused, and had asked her boyfriend, Tom Noir, to make sure her gun never fell into the wrong hands, and also to make it powerful enough to destroy her and her teammates if needed for the general good. Laura was killed by the same car bomb that destroyed Tom's leg, driving Tom to leave the team and hit the bottle. Unlike the other team members Laura does not appear even in flashbacks, and there is no description of her enhancements, save that early in the story Dominic mentions that the sheer power of her gun, which Noir has in fact hidden in her grave, scares even him. Her Gun reappears in the story's climax, functioning in the story as a Chekov's gun, and \\"Laura\\" is Noir's last word before activating it to kill himself, John Horus, and Frank Blacksmith. Her keyword is never revealed. Supporting characters=Frank Blacksmith Mentor to the Seven Guns and designer of the external gun attachment that the group utilised in their crime-fighting. The team witnessed Frank's apparent death at the hands of crooked cops years earlier. However, John Horus' actions have brought Frank out of hiding. Struck by the danger the team could pose, he had faked his own death to work on countermeasures for the government. He is convinced he is saving the world from them. In the intervening years, he has improved upon the technology within the Seven Guns and assembled both operational and covert-ops tactical teams of new model gun soldiers, the latter in secret. Assigning a soldier to kill Tom, he comes along personally to apologise for the necessity of the killing, and for the unintended murder, during an earlier attempted hit on Tom, of Laura Tarrant for whom Frank had felt sincere fondness.

The Gangs of New York. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. Biography Born to Irish immigrants in Cohoes Falls (near Lansingburgh, New York), McLaughlin left home at an early age to work as an immigrant runner in New York and soon became a well known street fighter and was imprisoned for a time on Blackwell's Island. After being severely disfigured in a brawl with a future Alderman of the First Ward, he retired from immigrant running and was employed as hired muscle for the Erie Railroad Company for several years. During the mid-1850s, he and Jim Turner were bodyguards for Lewis \\"Lew\\" Baker during his feud with William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Poole. He, along with Turner and several others were eventually convicted of aiding and abetting Baker after he shot and killed Poole on February 25, 1855. McLaughlin himself, while drinking at a Howard Street saloon and dance hall, was mortally wounded when he was shot on the morning of March 20, 1858 by sportsman Daniel \\"Dad\\" Cunningham. He and Cunningham had become involved in a heated argument after McLaughlin had insulted the boxing abilities of John Morrissey. When a fight broke out between the two men, Cunningham pulled a revolver and shot McLaughlin in the chest. Although later taken to the New York City Hospital, he would die of his wounds several hours after his arrival as doctors failed to find the bullet which remained lodged in his chest.

It starts off at the base of the Niagara Escarpment from James Mountain Road, a mountain-access road in the city, originally was a one-way street going south throughout but now has sections of it that are two-way. It extends north to the city's waterfront at the North End where it ends at Guise Street West right in front of the Harbour West Marina Complex and the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club. History James Street South, street life James Street South, architecture T.H.& B. Railway Bridge, James Street South South of the T. H. & B. Railway Bridge James Street South James Street was named after one of Nathaniel Hughson's sons. Hughson was one of the city founders of Hamilton along with George Hamilton and James Durand. Originally, James Street was called Lake Road because it was the road that led to Lake Ontario to the north. Then it was renamed to Jarvis Street after city founder George Hamilton's wife (Maria Jarvis) and then finally changed to its present-day James. George Hamilton, a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township after the war in 1815. He kept several east‚Äìwest roads which were originally Indian trails, but the north‚Äìsouth streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated \\"East\\" or \\"West\\" if they crossed James Street or Highway 6. Streets were designated \\"North\\" or \\"South\\" if they crossed King Street or Highway 8. James Street was the Lake Road and in 1835, James Street was extended south, but was interrupted by a bog at Hunter Street which eventually (1844) was drained out and graded. Hugh Cossart Baker Sr. established the first life insurance company in Canada 21 August 1847; the Canada Life Assurance Company. The firm was incorporated in 1849. The first head office was in Hamilton, Ontario on the top floor of the Mechanics' Institute on James Street near Merrick, where Hamilton City Centre now stands. The head office remained in Hamilton until 1900, when the new president George Cox moved it to Toronto. In 1872, the Bank of Hamilton was established. It had its head offices at the corner of King and James Streets and lasted until 1924. The Bank of Hamilton merged with The Commerce (later to become the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC) on January 2, 1924. It was one of the last surviving banks in Canada that was not headquartered in Toronto or Montreal. On June 20, 1877, the first commercial telephone service in Canada began in Hamilton, Ontario. Hugh Cossart Baker Jr. learned of Alexander Graham Bell's invention in 1877 at the Philadelphia International Exposition and from there decided to test the communication tool in Hamilton. Hugh Cossart Baker Jr. is credited with making the first telephone exchange in the British Empire from an office building at the corner of James and Main Street East which still stands there today (March 2007). In 1890, the first Bowling alley in the City opens at back of the J.W. MacDonald Tobacco shop, (66 James Street North). Architecture In 1929, the Pigott Building was built for $1,000,000. Known as Hamilton's first skyscraper, it has 18-floors and stands at . Originally an office building, the Pigott Building is now used for condominiums. The Lister Block building on the corner of James and King William Street was the first indoor commercial mall in Canada. In 1961, the old city hall, with its 38-metre clock tower was demolished to allow expansion of Eaton's department store. The clock and bell went into the tower of the 1990 Eaton Centre, now known as the Hamilton City Centre. In 1973, the Birks Building, at King and James was once described by Oscar Wilde as \\"the most beautiful building in all of North America.\\" In 2000, LIUNA Station reopened the James Street North Canadian National rail station as a banquet hall. In 1996 the station was used for the most expensive film ever made in Canada to that time, The Long Kiss Goodnight, which cost $95,000,000.00 U.S. to make. Then in 2000, X-Men (film) shot some of its scenes at LIUNA Station. It starred Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. The Bank of Montreal building (corner of James & Main Streets) had its cornerstone laid on 8 August 1928 and was completed 18 June 1929. At the time, the bank's directors were quoted in the local papers as saying; \\"This building is evidence of the Bank of Montreal's faith in Hamilton's future and Hamilton's growing importance as one of the leading commercial and industrial centres in Canada.\\" An impressive structure with a cathedral-like interior was designed by Kenneth G. Rea and built by the local Pigott Construction Company. In 1972, the Bank of Montreal vacated the building when they moved to the then-new Bank of Montreal Pavilion (now known as 1 James Street North), but the following year the Hamilton Public Library used it as a reference library. In September 1980, the building was vacated again and was used a couple times thereafter as a night club, (Monopoli and The Syndicate). It was then renovated afterwards and today it is home to a National Law Firm office. The Federal Building on James Street North was built in 1856. It was first home to a post office which eventually moved to the corner of King and John Streets. It was then the temporary site of the Hamilton City Hall between 1888 and 1890 while the new structure on the corner of James and Market Streets was being built. In 1897, the Sun-Life Assurance Company totally renovated it for their own district offices. In 1920, it went through another major renovation which saw the addition of two more storeys. Currently it is home to the Hamilton City Ballet which takes up the entire top (5th) floor and the rest of the building is used up as residential apartments. One can reach the Bruce Trail via James Street South. The trail cuts through the city along the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and used by many locals for a full day's hike. The trail is long and starts at Niagara Falls, passes through Hamilton and ends at the Bruce Peninsula. Hikers are led to scenic gorges, hidden waterfalls and places of quiet charm. Lister Block building The Lister Block, first built in 1886, was destroyed by fire in 1923 and the second building was erected in 1924. This classic Renaissance building is with six floors and sits on the corner of James and King William Street. The original building built in 1886 only had four floors. It was the first indoor commercial mall in Canada and is currently owned by LIUNA - Laborers' International Union of North America. The building one time was also home for the local Oldies 1150 CKOC radio station which has been on the air since May 1, 1922 and as of the year 2000 is the oldest radio station in English Canada, second oldest overall. The Lister Block is named for Joseph Lister, the original owner, who was a merchant, clothier, member of the city's Board of Water Commissioners and school trustee. His goal was to build a \\"most modern and central accommodation\\" for small merchants at modest rent. It was the centre of community life in Hamilton for much of the last century. It was built with excellent materials and workmanship during prosperous times in the city before stock markets crashed in 1929. One of the few buildings of its type in Ontario west of Toronto, its style is more frequently seen in American Great Lakes cities. In 2004, the then-abandoned Lister Block was used as a filming site for a music video for the song Home by Canadian rock band Three Days Grace. James North Art District North of the T. H. & B. Railway Bridge, on James Street South Bank of Montreal Building, now a Law Office Growth in the arts and culture sector has garnered high level media attention for Hamilton. A 2006 article in The Globe and Mail, entitled \\"Go West, Young Artist,\\" focused on the growing art scene in Hamilton. The second Friday of every month there's a James North Art Crawl where people experience many flavours of art and stroll the lively sidewalks and savour the tastes of nearby cafes and restaurants. Artist studios, such as that of indigenous fashion designer Angela DeMontigny, are also open for browsing. The Factory: Hamilton Media Arts Centre, opened up a new home on James Street North in 2006. Art galleries are springing up on many streets across the city: James Street, King William Street, Locke Street and King Street, to name a few. This, coupled with growth in the Downtown condo market which is drawing people back to the Core, is having a strong, positive impact on the cultural fabric of the city. The opening of the Downtown Arts Centre on Rebecca Street has spurred further creative activities in the Core. The Community Centre for Media Arts (CCMA) continues to operate in Downtown Hamilton. The CCMA works with marginalized populations and combines new media services such as website development, graphic design, video, and information technology, with arts education and skills development programming.Invest in Hamilton, Economic Development Review 2005, Wednesday, 28 June 2006, \\"City Remains Committed To Growing Arts & Culture\\" Page H20 The Hammertheatre Company, founded in January 2007, is a company devoted to theatre research in Hamilton and also devoted to the plays of artistic director Sky Gilbert whose plays will deal with issues of gender and sexuality. Gilbert is also the founder of legendary Toronto theatre, Buddies in Bad Times. There, Gilbert's iconic gay plays found an enthusiastic, vast audience. The theatre is at the old Ancient Order of Foresters building in the James Street North neighbourhood where Hamilton's Art scene continues to grow and where Sky has been living since 2004. Museum On Friday October 26, 2007 a new Museum opened up on James Street North near Cannon called, Hamilton HIStory + HERitage, the future of the past. The owner Graham J. Crawford shares the story of Hamilton in a multimedia exhibition space celebrating the lives of the men & women who have helped to shape the city. The space is also available for special meetings, presentations, book launches and school visits. There is no charge for the exhibitions. The museum's first presentation topic was that of James Street North and based on the works of local Hamilton historian Bill Manson which includes historical musical videos. Time Capsule St. Joseph's Hospital, James Street South A time capsule was buried beneath a marker on the north-east corner of James & Wilson Streets on Wednesday November 16, 1988 by the Jamesville Business Community under the aegis of the city's Business Improvement Area (B.I.A.) programme. It commemorates the completion of the James Street North streetscape project (1986‚Äì1988), which marked the renaissance of this historic link between the Hamilton Harbour and the City Centre. James Street has always been the focal point for new Canadians arriving in Hamilton, first by ship from overseas docking at the foot of James Street, later by train at the CN Railway Station. The first arrivals were English, Scottish and Irish; later came Italian and German; more recently Portuguese and then Greek. All in their turn have added to the cultural richness of the street. The capsule is to be opened on Tuesday, November 16, 2038, by the mayor, alderman and business Leaders of James Street North on that future day. It was a bright, warm, Indian summer afternoon when the capsule was buried; It is hoped it will be the same when the capsule is raised 50 years hence. Those that were in attendance in 1988 when the time capsule was buried include Bob Morrow (mayor), Sidney H. Leon (president of the Jamesville B.I.A.), Jerry Sherman (vice president of Jamesville B.I.A.), Vince Agro (alderman Ward 2), Filipe M. Vianna (treasurer) and William M. McCulloch (alderman Ward 2). Transportation In 1931, trains no longer blocked traffic as the James Street underpass was completed. (3 December 1931). Westend incline railway James South, looking North James Street, at the base of the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) was the site of the city's first Incline railway (1892‚Äì1932). Back then, the Incline railway on James Street was known as the Hamilton & Barton Incline Railway. It connected to present day Upper James Street. The city's second Incline railway on Wentworth Street South, (1895‚Äì1936), was known as the Eastend Incline Railway but was often called, The Mount Hamilton Incline Railway. The Eastend Incline on Wentworth Street was electrically operated and the Westend Incline on James Street depended on steam for its power. The west end lincline closed in 1932 and tracks removed and all that remains is a trail of the old railway. In 1924, following the city's booming development in the east, there was some serious discussion regarding the addition of a third incline railway. The 2 locations be considered at the time were Sherman Avenue or Ottawa Street South. The population of Hamilton Mountain at the time was 6,000. In 1929, the city's brochures were using the motto, \\"The City Beautiful and Hub of Canadian Highways\\" as well as \\"The City of Opportunity\\". In regards to the Incline railways, the brochures go on to boast, \\"There is no finer view anywhere on the North American continent than the panorama to be seen from the Hamilton mountain. The city below, the blue waters of Hamilton harbour and Lake Ontario. In the background, flanked on the east by the famous Niagara Fruit District and on the west by the beautiful Dundas Valley and a range of hills, combine to make a picture no artist could paint. There are several roads leading up to the summit and you can drive upon \\"high\\", but if you want to enjoy a unique experience and give the family a thrill, drive your car onto one of the Incline Railways and you will have something to tell the folks about when you go back home.\\" Waterfront Shuttle Route 99 - Waterfront Shuttle (seasonal) The Waterfront Shuttle is a free service offered by the Hamilton Street Railway. It has a seasonal schedule that runs weekends from May-to-October connecting Hamilton's downtown core to the waterfront and attractions that can be found there like HMCS Haida and the Parks Canada Discovery Centre. The route circles Hamilton's downtown core around York Boulevard (north), Bay Street South (west), King Street West (south) and James Street North (east). Then it travels north along James Street and the Art District until it reaches the waterfront at Guise Street past the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club, Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and the Harbour West Marina Complex. Then the route hangs a left on Discovery Drive, the site of the Parks Canada Discovery Centre. Also at this site is the Hamilton Harbour Queen (cruise boat), Hamiltonian (tour boat) and the Hamilton Waterfront Trolley. Waterfront Trolley The Hamilton Waterfront Trolley is a narrated tour along the 12 kilometre Hamilton Waterfront Trail. The main stop and departure spot is at the Hamilton Waterfront SCOOPS Ice Cream parlour, which provides the famous Stoney Creek Dairy Ice Cream. There are a dozen stops along the way between Princess Point at the western-end of the route to the eastern-end, the site of HMCS Haida. Also near this eastern-end route is the site of the Hamiltonian Tour Boat, which is a 12-passenger tour boat that offers a leisurely guided tour of Hamilton harbour with the captain providing interesting stories and history of one of North America's most noteworthy harbours. In addition to this there is also the Hamilton Harbour Queen Cruises which is another ship that offers 3-hour tour of the harbour along with Lunch, Dinner or other special events like Dance parties. This Harbour Queen Cruise was also the 2005 winner of the Hamilton Tourism Awards for \\"best tourism idea.\\"  Major intersections  James Street South Medical Arts building Landmark Place & Go Station, view from James South Note: Listing of streets from North to South. *Burlington Street West/East *Barton Street West/East *Cannon Street West/East - One-way street (Westbound only) *Wilson Street - One-way street (Eastbound Only) *King William Street - One-way street (Eastbound Only), Starts off at James Street North. *King Street West/East - One-way street (Westbound Only) *Main Street West/East - One-way street (Eastbound Only) *Jackson Street East *Hunter Street West/East - One-way street (Westbound Only) *Augusta Street *Charlton Avenue West/East - One-way street (Westbound Only) to the west, two-way street to the east.

Background Born in Red Bank, New Jersey, Kamin is a graduate of Amherst College, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts with honors in 1979, and the Yale University School of Architecture, from which he received a Master of Environmental Design in 1984. In 1999 he was a visiting fellow at the Franke Institute for the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In 2012‚Äì2013, he was a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. He holds honorary degrees from Monmouth University and North Central College. At North Central, he is an adjunct professor of art. Prior to being the architecture critic for the Chicago Tribune, Kamin served as its culture and suburban reporter from 1987 to 1992. He was a reporter and architecture writer for The Des Moines Register from 1984 to 1987. He had once worked as an office clerk for a San Francisco interior design and architecture firm. He has lectured in forums such as American Institute of Architects' National Convention, the annual meeting of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, the Ravinia Festival and Steppenwolf Theatre. He has discussed architecture on programs ranging from ABC's Nightline, History Channel, National Public Radio to WTTW-Ch. 11's Chicago Tonight. In 2014, he briefly appeared on \\"The Daily Show\\", when the show's then-host, Jon Stewart, made light of a large and controversial sign that the real estate developer Donald Trump placed on his Chicago skyscraper. Publications In 2001, the University of Chicago Press published \\"Why Architecture Matters: Lessons from Chicago,\\" a collection of Kamin's Chicago Tribune columns. In 2010, the University of Chicago Press published \\"Terror and Wonder: Architecture In a Tumultuous Age,\\" a collection of Kamin's columns from the Tribune and other publications.http://www.press.uchicago.edu Kamin also wrote the commentaries for \\"Tribune Tower: American Landmark,\\" a guide to the newspaper's neo-Gothic Tribune Tower skyscraper published in 2000.https://www.amazon.com During his Nieman Fellowship, Kamin co-wrote and edited an ebook, \\"The Gates of Harvard Yard: The Complete Story, in Words and Pictures, of a Great University's Iconic Portals.\\" The ebook was published by the Nieman Foundation. In 2016, Princeton Architectural Press published a paperback version of the book, \\"Gates of Harvard Yard.\\" In 2020, Princeton Architectural Press published another Kamin book, \\"Amherst College: The Campus Guide,\\" which presents six walking tours of the 1,000-acre New England campus. Kamin cites as his influences Paul Gapp, Paul Goldberger, Lois Wagner Green, Ada Louise Huxtable, Vincent Scully, Allan Temko, and Joel Upton. Kamin's wife is the author and former Tribune reporter Barbara Mahany. They have two sons Ted and Will who are both athletes. Awards Published in 1998, Kamin‚Äôs six-part series, ‚ÄúReinventing the Lakefront‚Äù shed light on numerous problems along the city's shoreline, such as the disparity between lakefront parks bordered by largely white and affluent areas on Chicago's North Side and those lined by black and poor neighborhoods on the city's South Side. Following the publication of the deeply reported essays, Mayor Richard M. Daley and the Chicago Park District authorized comprehensive plans for four of Chicago‚Äôs seven lakefront parks, an area of nearly 2,000 acres and more than 10 miles of shoreline. In addition, the city altered its plan for a former U.S. Steel site on the far south lakefront, bringing the total area affected by the series to almost 2,500 acres and 12 miles of shoreline.Chicago Tribune reprint of lakefront series Kamin's 1999 Pulitzer entry in criticism consisted of four parts of the six- part lakefront series, plus six other works of criticism on subjects ranging from the renovation of the North Michigan Avenue Marriott Hotel to an addition to Chicago's Adler Planetarium. After the first round of the two-round Pulitzer judging, his entry was moved from the criticism category to the beat reporting category. The Chicago Reader described the situation as one in which \\"every jury that read his stories wanted someone else to judge them\\". One of the criticism jurors described the dilemma \\"He seems to do some investigative reporting and some advocacy editorializing, and some members of the panel didn't quite know what to make of it. So we did the cowardly thing and sent it to another panel.\\" But the Pulitzer Prize Board, which has the ultimate authority, reversed the decision and moved Kamin's entry back to criticism. Kamin's Pulitzer Prize citation praised \\"his lucid coverage of city architecture, including an influential series supporting the development of Chicago's lakefront area.‚Äù Kamin is the recipient of 45 awards. Among his other honors are the George Polk Award for Criticism (1996), the American Institute of Architects' Institute Honor for Collaborative Achievement (1999) and the AIA's Presidential Citation, conferred in 2004.

During the Second World War Canada, Britain and the US forwarded large quantities of military materials to Russia. Among those were jeeps, trucks, and amphibious vehicles like the 6x6 DUKW and the 4x4 Ford GPA. The latter were used to help men and equipment get across the many rivers of Eastern Europe and combat the Germans. Seeing merits of such vehicles, after the war, Russia decided to develop two similar vehicles, using domestic automotive parts, the BAV, an equivalent of the DUKW, and the MAV, an equivalent of the Ford GPA. Due to bad reception of the Ford GPA 'Seep' by Allied soldiers, most of them were routed to Russia under the US Lend-Lease program, before production was halted prematurely in 1943. The research institute NAMI developed a prototype NAMI-011, basing on GAZ-67B parts, in 1949. The authorities decided, that it should be manufactured in GAZ works, as GAZ-011, but the factory was reluctant, because a design needed much perfecting, while the GAZ-67B was obsolete and due to be replaced with GAZ-69. As a result, an improved model GAZ-46 was built using the frame and parts of the GAZ-69 4x4 half-ton light truck, of which production started with the Gorki factory of 1952. The principal functions of the GAZ-46 MAV were to make light work of crossing lakes and rivers for men and materials, as well as performing river reconnaissance. As of the end of the fifties the latter role became reserved for the BRDM-1, a much more powerful 4x4 amphibious vehicle. The GAZ-46 MAV used the mechanics of existing Russian GAZ 4x4 \\"jeeps\\" as well as being created somewhat bigger for better buoyancy, and its design is heavily inspired by that of the wartime Ford GPA. Just like the 'Seep', its hull is entirely out of steel, welded to a steel chassis. The layout is the same: engine compartment in the front, crew compartment in the center, and the spare wheel horizontally mounted on the rear deck. The driver and the commander of the vehicle have individual seats in the front with a three-seat bench behind them. The windshield can be folded down, and if necessary, a cover can be installed to close the cockpit. The engine is coupled to a manual three-speed gearbox and a two-speed transfer-case. Also, there is a screw- propellor for in the water propulsion, driven by a power take-off, and a proper rudder provides good maneuverability. Front and rear suspension is in the form of leaf-sprung rigid live axles. Thanks to its steeply raked front and rear and four-wheel drive, the GAZ can manage reasonably steep river banks before swimming across. Popular culture GAZ 46s of the Soviet armed forces were depicted in the 2007 action-thriller Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Replicas with fiberglass hulls were utilized for filming. References * Ren√© Pohl: Mit dem Auto baden gehen.

Then 3 B (or 5 B) denotes the ball of the same form, with 3 r (or 5 r) replacing r. Notice that the definition of balls requires r > 0\\\\. *In the infinite version, the collection of balls can be countable or uncountable. *The result may fail if the radii are not bounded: consider the family of all balls centered at 0 in Rd; any disjoint subfamily consists of only one ball B, and 5 B does not contain all the balls in this family. *In the context of a general metric space (i.e., not necessarily separable) the resulting sub- collection may not be countably infinite. ProofFinite version= Without loss of generality, we assume that the collection of balls is not empty; that is, n > 0. Let B_{j_1} be the ball of largest radius. Inductively, assume that B_{j_1},\\\\dots,B_{j_k} have been chosen. If there is some ball in B_1,\\\\dots,B_n that is disjoint from B_{j_1}\\\\cup B_{j_2}\\\\cup\\\\cdots\\\\cup B_{j_k}, let B_{j_{k+1}} be such ball with maximal radius (breaking ties arbitrarily), otherwise, we set m := k and terminate the inductive definition. Now set X:=\\\\bigcup_{k=1}^m 3\\\\,B_{j_k}. It remains to show that B_i\\\\subset X for every i=1,2,\\\\dots,n. This is clear if i\\\\in{j_1,\\\\dots,j_m}. Otherwise, there necessarily is some k\\\\in{1,\\\\dots,m} such that Bi intersects B_{j_k} and the radius of B_{j_k} is at least as large as that of Bi. The triangle inequality then easily implies that B_i\\\\subset 3\\\\,B_{j_k}\\\\subset X, as needed. This completes the proof of the finite version. =Infinite version= Let F denote the collection of all balls Bj, j ‚àà J, that are given in the statement of the covering lemma. The following result provides a certain disjoint subcollection G of F. If this subcollection G is described as { B_j, j \\\\in J'}, the property of G, stated below, readily proves that :: \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\in J} B_j \\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup_{j \\\\in J'} 5\\\\,B_{j}. Precise form of the covering lemma. Let F be a collection of (nondegenerate) balls in a metric space, with bounded radii. There exists a disjoint subcollection G of F with the following property: ::every ball B in F intersects a ball C in G such that B ‚äÇ 5 C. (Degenerate balls only contain the center; they are excluded from this discussion.) Let R be the supremum of the radii of balls in F. Consider the partition of F into subcollections Fn, n ‚â• 0, consisting of balls B whose radius is in (2‚àín‚àí1R, 2‚àínR]. A sequence Gn, with Gn ‚äÇ Fn, is defined inductively as follows. First, set H0 = F0 and let G0 be a maximal disjoint subcollection of H0. Assuming that G0,...,Gn have been selected, let : \\\\mathbf{H}_{n+1} = { B \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}_{n+1} : \\\\ B \\\\cap C = \\\\emptyset, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\forall C \\\\in \\\\mathbf{G}_0 \\\\cup \\\\mathbf{G}_1 \\\\cup \\\\ldots \\\\cup \\\\mathbf{G}_n }, and let Gn+1 be a maximal disjoint subcollection of Hn+1. The subcollection ::\\\\mathbf{G} := \\\\bigcup_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\mathbf{G}_n of F satisfies the requirements: G is a disjoint collection, and every ball B ‚àà F intersects a ball C ‚àà G such that B ‚äÇ 5 C. Indeed, let n be such that B belongs to Fn. Either B does not belong to Hn, which implies n > 0 and means that B intersects a ball from the union of G0,...,Gn‚àí1, or B ‚àà Hn and by maximality of Gn, B intersects a ball in Gn. In any case, B intersects a ball C that belongs to the union of G0,...,Gn. Such a ball C has radius > 2‚àín‚àí1R. Since the radius of B is ‚â§ 2‚àínR, it is less than twice that of C and the conclusion B ‚äÇ 5 C follows from the triangle inequality as in the finite version.The proof given is based on =Remarks= *The constant 5 is not optimal. If the scale c‚àín, c > 1, is used instead of 2‚àín for defining Fn, the final value is 1 + 2c instead of 5. Any constant larger than 3 gives a correct statement of the lemma, but not 3. *In the most general case of an arbitrary metric space, the selection of a maximal disjoint subcollection requires a form of Zorn's lemma. *Using a finer analysis, when the original collection F is a Vitali covering of a subset E of Rd, one shows that the subcollection G, defined in the above proof, covers E up to a Lebesgue-negligible set. See the \\"From the covering lemma to the covering theorem\\" section of this entry. Applications and method of use An application of the Vitali lemma is in proving the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood maximal inequality. As in this proof, the Vitali lemma is frequently used when we are, for instance, considering the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure, \\\\lambda_d, of a set E ‚äÇ Rd, which we know is contained in the union of a certain collection of balls {B_{j}:j\\\\in J}, each of which has a measure we can more easily compute, or has a special property one would like to exploit. Hence, if we compute the measure of this union, we will have an upper bound on the measure of E. However, it is difficult to compute the measure of the union of all these balls if they overlap. By the Vitali lemma, we may choose a subcollection {B_{j}:j\\\\in J'} which is disjoint and such that \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\in J'}5 B_j\\\\supset \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\in J} B_j\\\\supset E. Therefore, : \\\\lambda_d(E)\\\\leq \\\\lambda_d \\\\Bigl( \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\in J}B_{j} \\\\Bigr) \\\\leq \\\\lambda_d \\\\Bigl( \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\in J'}5B_{j} \\\\Bigr)\\\\leq \\\\sum_{j\\\\in J'} \\\\lambda_d(5 B_{j}). Now, since increasing the radius of a d-dimensional ball by a factor of five increases its volume by a factor of 5d, we know that : \\\\sum_{j\\\\in J'} \\\\lambda_d(5B_{j}) = 5^d \\\\sum_{j\\\\in J'} \\\\lambda_d(B_{j}) and thus : \\\\lambda_d(E) \\\\leq 5^{d} \\\\sum_{j\\\\in J'}\\\\lambda_d(B_{j}). Vitali covering theorem In the covering theorem, the aim is to cover, up to a \\"negligible set\\", a given set E ‚äÜ Rd by a disjoint subcollection extracted from a Vitali covering for E : a Vitali class or Vitali covering \\\\mathcal{V} for E is a collection of sets such that, for every x ‚àà E and Œ¥ > 0, there is a set U in the collection \\\\mathcal{V} such that x ‚àà U and the diameter of U is non-zero and less than Œ¥. In the classical setting of Vitali, the negligible set is a Lebesgue negligible set, but measures other than the Lebesgue measure, and spaces other than Rd have also been considered, as is shown in the relevant section below. The following observation is useful: if \\\\mathcal{V} is a Vitali covering for E and if E is contained in an open set Œ© ‚äÜ Rd, then the subcollection of sets U in \\\\mathcal{V} that are contained in Œ© is also a Vitali covering for E. Vitali's covering theorem for the Lebesgue measure The next covering theorem for the Lebesgue measure Œªd is due to . A collection \\\\mathcal{V} of measurable subsets of Rd is a regular family (in the sense of Lebesgue) if there exists a constant C such that :\\\\mathrm{diam}(V)^d \\\\le C \\\\, \\\\lambda_d(V) for every set V in the collection \\\\mathcal{V}. The family of cubes is an example of regular family \\\\mathcal{V}, as is the family \\\\mathcal{V}(m) of rectangles in R2 such that the ratio of sides stays between m‚àí1 and m, for some fixed m ‚â• 1\\\\. If an arbitrary norm is given on Rd, the family of balls for the metric associated to the norm is another example. To the contrary, the family of all rectangles in R2 is not regular. Theorem. Let E ‚äÜ Rd be a measurable set with finite Lebesgue measure, and let \\\\mathcal{V} be a regular family of closed subsets of Rd that is a Vitali covering for E. Then there exists a finite or countably infinite disjoint subcollection {U_{j}}\\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{V} such that : \\\\lambda_d \\\\Bigl( E \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{j}U_{j} \\\\Bigr) = 0. The original result of is a special case of this theorem, in which d = 1 and \\\\mathcal{V} is a collection of intervals that is a Vitali covering for a measurable subset E of the real line having finite measure. The theorem above remains true without assuming that E has finite measure. This is obtained by applying the covering result in the finite measure case, for every integer n ‚â• 0, to the portion of E contained in the open annulus Œ©n of points x such that n < x < n+1.See . A somewhat related covering theorem is the Besicovitch covering theorem. To each point a of a subset A ‚äÜ Rd, a Euclidean ball B(a, ra) with center a and positive radius ra is assigned. Then, as in the Vitali theorem, a subcollection of these balls is selected in order to cover A in a specific way. The main differences with the Vitali covering theorem are that on one hand, the disjointness requirement of Vitali is relaxed to the fact that the number Nx of the selected balls containing an arbitrary point x ‚àà Rd is bounded by a constant Bd depending only upon the dimension d; on the other hand, the selected balls do cover the set A of all the given centers. allowed a negligible error. Vitali's covering theorem for the Hausdorff measure One may have a similar objective when considering Hausdorff measure instead of Lebesgue measure. The following theorem applies in that case.. Theorem. Let Hs denote s-dimensional Hausdorff measure, let E ‚äÜ Rd be an Hs-measurable set and \\\\mathcal{V} a Vitali class of closed sets for E. Then there exists a (finite or countably infinite) disjoint subcollection {U_{j}}\\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{V} such that either : H^{s} \\\\left( E\\\\backslash \\\\bigcup_{j}U_{j} \\\\right)=0 \\\\ \\\\mbox{ or }\\\\sum_{j} \\\\mathrm{diam} (U_{j})^{s}=\\\\infty. Furthermore, if E has finite s-dimensional Hausdorff measure, then for any Œµ > 0, we may choose this subcollection {Uj} such that : H^{s}(E)\\\\leq \\\\sum_{j} \\\\mathrm{diam} (U_{j})^{s}+\\\\varepsilon. This theorem implies the result of Lebesgue given above. Indeed, when s = d, the Hausdorff measure Hs on Rd coincides with a multiple of the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure. If a disjoint collection {U_{j}} is regular and contained in a measurable region B with finite Lebesgue measure, then :\\\\sum_j \\\\mathrm{diam}(U_j)^d \\\\le C \\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_d(U_j) \\\\le C \\\\, \\\\lambda_d(B) < +\\\\infty which excludes the second possibility in the first assertion of the previous theorem. It follows that E is covered, up to a Lebesgue-negligible set, by the selected disjoint subcollection. From the covering lemma to the covering theorem The covering lemma can be used as intermediate step in the proof of the following basic form of the Vitali covering theorem. Actually, a little more is needed, namely the precised form of the covering lemma obtained in the \\"proof of the infinite version\\". :Theorem. For every subset E of Rd and every Vitali cover of E by a collection F of closed balls, there exists a disjoint subcollection G which covers E up to a Lebesgue-negligible set. Without loss of generality, one can assume that all balls in F are nondegenerate and have radius ‚â§ 1\\\\. By the precised form of the covering lemma, there exists a disjoint subcollection G of F such that every ball B ‚àà F intersects a ball C ‚àà G for which B ‚äÇ 5 C. Let r > 0 be given, and let Z denote the set of points z ‚àà E that are not contained in any ball from G and belong to the open ball B(r) of radius r, centered at 0. It is enough to show that Z is Lebesgue-negligible, for every given r. Let G denote the subcollection of those balls in G that meet B(r). Consider the partition of G into sets Gn, n ‚â• 0, consisting of balls that have radius in (2‚àín‚àí1, 2‚àín]. Any ball B in F that meets B(r) is contained in B(r+2). It follows from the disjointness property of G that : \\\\sum { \\\\lambda_d(C) : C \\\\in G } = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\Bigl(\\\\sum { \\\\lambda_d(C) : C \\\\in G_n } \\\\Bigr) \\\\le \\\\lambda_d(B(r+2)) < +\\\\infty. This implies that Gn is a finite set for every n. Given Œµ > 0, we may select N such that : \\\\sum { \\\\lambda_d(C) : C \\\\in G_n, \\\\, n > N } < \\\\varepsilon. Let z ‚àà Z be fixed. By definition of Z, this point z does not belong to the closed set K equal to the (finite) union of balls in Gk, k ‚â§ N. By the Vitali cover property, one can find a ball B ‚àà F containing z, contained in B(r) and disjoint from K. By the property of G, the ball B meets C and is included in 5 C for some ball C ‚àà G. One sees that C ‚àà G because C intersects B(r), but C does not belong to any family Gk, k ‚â§ N, since B meets C but is disjoint from K. This proves that every point z ‚àà Z is contained in the union of 5 C, when C varies in Gn, n > N, hence : Z \\\\subset U_N := \\\\bigcup \\\\, { 5 \\\\, C : C \\\\in G_n, \\\\, n > N } and : \\\\lambda_d(U_N) \\\\le \\\\sum { \\\\lambda_d(5 \\\\, C) : C \\\\in G_n, \\\\, n > N } = 5^d \\\\sum { \\\\lambda_d(C) : C \\\\in G_n, \\\\, n > N } < 5^d \\\\varepsilon. Since Œµ > 0 is arbitrary, this shows that Z is negligible.The proof given is based on , with some notation taken from . Infinite-dimensional spaces The Vitali covering theorem is not valid in infinite-dimensional settings. The first result in this direction was given by David Preiss in 1979:. there exists a Gaussian measure Œ≥ on an (infinite-dimensional) separable Hilbert space H so that the Vitali covering theorem fails for (H, Borel(H), Œ≥). This result was strengthened in 2003 by Jaroslav Ti≈°er: the Vitali covering theorem in fact fails for every infinite-dimensional Gaussian measure on any (infinite- dimensional) separable Hilbert space..

Biography Born in a Jewish family in Chicago, Blitzstein started working the rackets in the late 1950s. Standing six feet tall and weighing three hundred pounds, he sported a goatee and moustache, dressed flamboyantly, and drove a 1973 Cadillac Eldorado. It was said he had a close physical resemblance to the Italian opera singer Luciano Pavarotti. Blitzstein lived at 6720 North Damen Avenue in Rogers Park, Chicago, with his third wife, but spent a great deal of time at Phil Alderisio's bar, The Tradewinds in The Patch. He had been a close associate of convicted mob bookmaker Henry Kushner. When Kushner was convicted of bookmaking by the FBI and sent to prison, Blitzstein took over his clientele along with mob bookmaker Boodie Cowan, who was later murdered, probably by Anthony Spilotro. Blitzstein was later convicted of racketeering. When he was released from prison, he moved to Las Vegas to serve as muscle for Tony Spilotro. Spilotro, his brother, John, and Blitzstein ran the Gold Rush Ltd. jewelry store, located on West Sahara Avenue, which was a front for the Hole in the Wall Gang, so named because they punched holes through walls and ceilings to grab loot and run. Blitzstein also worked as a fence for stolen goods at the combination jewelry store and electronics factory. The Hole in the Wall Gang His capo, Anthony Spilotro, in 1976, formed a burglary ring with his brother Michael and Blitzstein, utilizing about eight associates as burglars. The crew became known as the Hole in the Wall Gang because of its penchant for gaining entry by drilling through the exterior walls and ceilings of the buildings they burglarized. Other gang members included Peanuts Pancsko, Butch Pancsko and Pops Pancsko, Frank DeLegge, Michael LaJoy, Joseph D'Argento, Gerald Tomasczek, Peter Basile of Wilmette, Illinois, Carl Urbanotti of Chicago, Illinois, Ernest Lehnigg of Addison, Illinois, Samuel Cusumano, Joseph Cusumano, Ernesto \\"Ernie\\" Davino of Las Vegas, \\"Crazy Larry\\" Neumann, Wayne Matecki, Salvatore \\"Sonny\\" Romano, Leonardo \\"Leo\\" Guardino of Las Vegas, Frank Cullotta of Las Vegas, and former Las Vegas detective, Joseph Blasko of Las Vegas, who acted as a lookout and who later worked as a bartender at the Crazy Horse Too, a gentleman's club, and died of a heart attack in 2002. Following the botched burglary at Bertha's Gifts & Home Furnishings on July 4, 1981, Cullotta, Blasko, Guardino, Davino, Neumann, and Matecki were arrested and each charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, attempted grand larceny and possession of burglary tools. They were locked into the Las Vegas police department's holding cell in downtown Las Vegas. The only members of Spilotro's gang not arrested for the July 4th burglary were Blitzstein, Michael Spilotro, Romano and Cusumano. By this time, Spilotro's relationship with Rosenthal had collapsed, as Tony had had an affair with Rosenthal's wife, Geraldine McGee Rosenthal. Meanwhile, Cullotta had turned state's witness, testifying against Spilotro. But the testimony was insufficient, and Tony was acquitted. In 1967, according to FBI affidavits, \\"Fat Herbie\\" ordered the murder of associate loan shark and bookmaker Arthur \\"Boodie\\" Cowan for holding back a street tax. Although Herbie did not participate in the July 4 robbery, he was indicted with Tony Spilotro on federal racketeering charges. The charges were later dropped for insufficient evidence. In 1976, Blitzstein was convicted of running an illegal gambling operation. He was one of the few Hole in the Wall Gang members who was not arrested after a botched July 4 burglary at Bertha's Home Furnishings in 1981. Blitzstein is described by FBI agent William Roemer in his book The Enforcer as one of the mobsters tested by the FBI in the early days of the Top Hoodlum Program. Herbert was a 183-cm, 135-kg (six-foot, three-hundred pound) man who drove a white 1973 Cadillac Eldorado and dressed impeccably. In 1987, Blitzstein was convicted on federal charges, including credit card fraud, conspiracy, and receiving stolen property. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. While incarcerated in California, Blitzstein was taken off his heart medication by a prison medic and suffered a heart attack as a result. His case was part of a 1991 congressional investigation into medical abuse in prisons. On 10 December 1991, Blitzstein was unanimously nominated by the Nevada Gaming Control Board for inclusion in its official Black Book. Former police officer and board member Steve DuCharme said that Blitzstein's life \\"reads like a crime novel,\\" and that Blitzstein was responsible for some of the most \\"embarrassing\\" crimes in Las Vegas city history. Nevada Deputy District Attorney Charlotte Matanane called Blitzstein a \\"notorious and unsavory person\\" during the relevant board hearing, and accused him of associating with Frank Rosenthal, among others. Death On January 6, 1997, Blitzstein was killed execution style in his Las Vegas home. It was later revealed that in late 1996, the Los Angeles crime family along with the Buffalo crime family joined forces to take over a loan sharking and auto insurance fraud racket in Las Vegas controlled by Blitzstein. The L.A. Underboss Carmen Milano along with L.A. soldier's Stephen Cino and Louis Caruso and L.A associate's Johnny Branco and Peter Caruso originally planned to rob and steal Blitzstein's jewelry. After stealing Blitzstein's jewelry the group planned to use Buffalo family soldier Robert \\"Bobby\\" Panaro as the fence. It was decided by Milano that Buffalo family boss Joseph Todaro Sr. would receive a piece of the Blitzstein rackets in Las Vegas. The job of robbing Blitzstein was given to Peter Caruso, but Caruso changed the plan and decided to murder Blitzstein instead and take over his Las Vegas operations. Caruso hired L.A. associate Alfred Mauriello who in turn hired associates Antonio Davi and Richard Friedman to be the hitmen in the murder. Then Caruso arranged with Joe DeLuca who was one of Blitzstein's partners in a auto repair shop to get them access into Blitzstein's home. On January 6, 1997 Antonio Davi and Richard Friedman shot and killed Blitzstein in his own home. During the trial it was revealed that L.A. associate John Branco had been wearing a wire for the FBI and helped two FBI agents infiltrated Milano's Las Vegas crew. Of the seven people arrested in the plot to kill Blitzstein, four pleaded guilty to lesser charges in order to receive reduced sentences. One died in prison awaiting trial, and two went to trial and were acquitted. In popular culture Blitzstein, portrayed in the film Casino by Bret McCormick as Bernie Blue, was not murdered by the Las Vegas police during a bungled arrest as portrayed in the film. The shooting depicted in Casino was that of another reputed associate of Anthony Spilotro named Frank Bluestein, not Blitzstein. Details of Blitzstein's murder, written by Cathy Scott, were included in the 2012 book Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre, an anthology of crime stories.\\"Masters of True Crime by R.

Murders  David O'Hearn was murdered in his Albion Park home on 12 June 1998. His head was smashed in with a wine decanter. He was then decapitated, with his head later found in the kitchen sink. His hand was cut off, and he had been partially disemboweled. Valera (previously known as Mark van Krevel) had used O'Hearn's hand to draw a pentagram and an inverted crucifix on the living room walls. Frank Arkell, a former Wollongong mayor and former member of the New South Wales State Parliament, was murdered in his Wollongong home on 26 June 1998. His head had been smashed in with a bedside lamp, with the electric cord wrapped tightly around his neck. Tie pins were stuck in Arkell's eyes and cheeks. Arkell had been mentioned in the Wood Royal Commission's report; he had been embroiled in child pornography and paedophilia scandals in the years leading up to his death, and he had been acquitted of child sex offences six months before his murder, but investigations were continuing, with further charges to be laid. During the investigation into the murders, the media believed the O'Hearn and Arkell murders were linked to murder of convicted child sex offender; Trevor Parkin who was found bashed and partially dismembered at his flat in Glebe on 29 December 1997.  Confession and conviction  Three months after the two murders, Valera turned up at Wollongong Police Station to confess to the crimes. Valera was a 19-year-old local who had never come under police notice before. He lived in different places around the area, including a house with a friend which was just a few doors down the street from O'Hearn. Valera told police that the killing of O'Hearn was \\"just random\\" and that he didn't know if O'Hearn was homosexual or not. He had killed Arkell, an alleged paedophile, because he was a \\"very, very horrible man\\". At his trial in 2000, Valera attempted to run a homosexual advance defense, claiming that his father, Jack van Krevel, had sexually and physically assaulted him during his childhood and that this had caused him to lose control when each of O'Hearn and Arkell had sexually propositioned him and this caused flashbacks of his troubled childhood. Valera's evidence was that he was propositioned by O'Hearn immediately before the killing occurred while Arkell had seduced him and that they had been in a sexual relationship for more than a year but Arkell wanted him to be the active partner for the first time immediately before Valera killed him. In convicting Valera of murder the jury had rejected the homosexual advance defense. In sentencing Valera to two terms of life imprisonment, Justice Tim Studdert found that Valera's father had been violent towards him, but rejected Valera's evidence that he had been sexually abused by his father or that either O'Hearn or Arkell had propositioned him and that this prompted a loss of self control. In August 2000, Valera was found guilty of the murders, and in December 2000 he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.. He later appealed against the sentence, but the appeal was dismissed.. He is serving his sentence at Goulburn Correctional Centre.  Further family issues  Less than two weeks after Valera became the third-youngest person in NSW to be sentenced to life without parole, his father, Jack van Krevel, was found stabbed to death in his Albion Park home. It was later found that Valera's sister and van Krevel's daughter, Belinda van Krevel, had 'asked' Keith Schreiber (a friend of Valera's who was also a suspect in the O'Hearn murder) to kill her father because he was molesting her two-year-old daughter, and blamed him for Valera's imprisonment. Schreiber was found guilty of the murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years.. He became eligible for parole in 2012. Belinda van Krevel, who had been in a relationship with Schreiber, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three and a half years.. She was released from prison on 1 June 2007, saying \\"I just want to get on with my life\\". She was subsequently arrested in 2010 and charged with assault and theft.

In 1928, the club joined the Victorian Football Association where it played until 1984 when the club went into recess. In 1996, the Kingsville Football Club in the Western Region Football League who by this time had taken over the Yarraville ground changed their name to Yarraville. In 2007 the Yarraville Football Club merged with the Seddon Football Club to become the Yarraville Seddon Eagles. History =The VJFA years (1903‚Äì1927) Yarraville Football Club was formed on April 1, 1903. It then joined the Victorian Junior Football Association, where it was highly successful. Between 1905 and 1913, the club missed the Grand Final only once, and won a total of four premierships: in 1905, 1908, 1909 and 1912. The 1912 premiership came after a controversial final: Yarraville had lost to Port Melbourne Railway United by three points, but protested that the goal umpire had erred in awarding one of Railway's goals in the second quarter; the protest was upheld and the game was awarded to Yarraville. Railway was the minor premier and still had the right to challenge for the premiership, but declined to challenge as its own act of protest, resulting in Yarraville winning the premiership. Yarraville won three more premierships during its time in the association ‚Äì in 1920, and back-to-back in 1925 and 1926. Overall, it won seven premierships and finished runners up six times in its 25 years in the competition. It was also the only two-time outright winner of the John Wren Shield, a perpetual premiership trophy which was awarded annually to the VJFA premiers, then permanently to the first team to win it three times; the club received the shield in 1909 and 1926. The VFA years (1928‚Äì1984) Yarraville joined the VFA senior competition in 1928. Prior to the season, the club merged with the neighbouring VJFA rival, the Kingsville Football Club. In 1935 the club won its first VFA grand final. Its next VFA grand final win was in 1961 the same year the VFA added a division 2. By the mid 70s the club had been relegated to the 2nd division and in 1976 finished last on the ladder. The club struggled for support in Division 2, and in the mid-1970s when Association-wide crowds were averaging more than 4,500, Yarraville still seldom drew more than 1,000 fans to games. The club's on-field position improved in 1977 thanks to a big sponsorship deal, and Yarraville finished on top of the ladder, but was unable to win the grand final. Yarraville remained a top side in 2nd division until 1980, but its form deteriorated dramatically thereafter. The club moved from Yarraville Oval to Western Oval in 1983, but won only one game across all three grades in the season. Seeing no prospects for lasting viability, the VFA withdrew Yarraville's playing licence in January 1984.  The WRFL years (1996‚Äì2006)  In 1996 The Kingsville Football Club changed its name to Yarraville. Kingsville had started playing at the Yarraville Oval several years earlier. The first game under the Yarraville name saw Yarraville lose to Parkside. However, after that Yarraville would win 15 out of 18 games in 1996 and take 1st place on the ladder. They made it to the Grand Final but would lose to Parkside. In 1997 Yarraville again took top spot and again took on Parkside in the Grand Final but this time were able to win the Flag. Yarraville's reserves team also won the grand final beating Parkside as well. In 1998 Yarraville suffered after losing many of the players who had helped win the flags the previous year and would finish midway through the ladder. In 1999 Yarraville struggled and would only manage 4 wins for the season. They finished last and were relegated to the second division of the WRFL. In 2000 Yarraville were able to rebuild and had probably the best team since the '97 grand final winning team. The club was determined to get back to division 1 where they felt they rightfully belonged. They won all but one game for the season and often won by margins of 20-30 goals. On 15 July Yarraville kicked 55 goals and 33 behinds against the struggling Brooklyn. Yarraville defeated Glenorden in the Grand final. The win put Yarraville back into 1st division for the following season. From 2001 to 2006 Yarraville maintained its spot in 1st division and just missed out on playing finals several times. During the 2006 season Yarraville began talks about a possible merger with the Seddon Football Club. Seddon had dropped out of the senior competition after 10 games due to poor performance. The merger was eventually agreed upon. The Yarraville football club played its final game at the end of the 2006 season when they defeated St Albans. Although this marked the end of the Yarraville Football Club. 2007 marked the beginning of the Yarraville Seddon Eagles Football Club.

His memoirs 'Vospominaniya' ('Reminiscences') appeared in 1890, and recorded his experiences as a touring musician, as part of a panorama of Russian musical life during the mid 19th century. He became an honorary member of the Russian Musical Society in 1896. Biography Afanasyev was born in Tobolsk in 1821. He obtained his musical education from his father, the violinist Yakov Ivanovich Afanasyev, an illegitimate son of Prince Ivan Dolgorukov. In 1838, two years after his debut as a violinist in Moscow, he was appointed concertmaster of the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. However, he resigned in 1841 to conduct the serf orchestra of a wealthy landowner at V√Øksa, near Saint Petersburg. In 1846, Afanasyev left to embark on a concert tour of Russia, and eventually settled in Saint Petersburg in 1851, where he continued to perform as a soloist and as the concertmaster (sometimes conductor) of the Italian Opera. He quit orchestral work to begin teaching piano in 1853 at the Smolin'√Øy Institute, before touring Western Europe with moderate success in 1857. After returning to Russia, Afanasyev chose to commit himself to composition, and reached his finest in his small-scale works, which tended to suffer far less from the inconsistencies in technical skill that stemmed from his informal training. He won particular acclaim for works which were inspired by the melodies and rhythms of Russian folk music, an abiding interest of his which led to the publication of his popular anthology (1866) of folksongs arranged for four-part choir. Afanasyev's chamber music, most notably the string quartet Volga (c. 1860) which won a prize from the Russian Musical Society in 1861, also enjoyed similar acclaim. Volga was the first string quartet written by a native Russian composer.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom, ed., Vil. I, p. 65, AFANASIEV, Nikolay Yakovlevich In contrast, his operas had far less enthusiastic receptions. Although the Mariinsky Theatre staged Ammalat-bek in 1870, it has not been performed anywhere since; Sten'ka Razin failed to pass state censorship, while Vakula-kuznets was never performed. The manuscripts of several further operas and orchestral works remain unpublished. He died in Saint Petersburg in 1898, aged 77. References *Spencer, Jennifer. \\"Afanas'yev, Nikolay Yakovlevich\\".

Location Greendale is situated on c. of land, near Kilbarrack DART suburban rail station and Greendale Shopping Centre, and its grounds include a basketball court once used by Killester Basketball club and now used by KUBS Basket Ball Club. History=Construction Greendale was built in the mid-1970s, opening in 1975, with capacity for not less than 800 pupils. The school quickly exceeded its numbers, and extension work in the early 1980s allowed for up to 900 students. By 1996, however, core pupil numbers were down to 449, then 215 at the start of the 2003‚Äì2004 school year, and 160 in 2006. In addition to the day pupils, Greendale has long offered a range of night courses and adult education initiatives, facilitating up to 1,400 students at a time. Closure According to the Minister for Education, the trustees of Greendale made a decision in March 2004 to close the school to new entrants in September 2004, and to close altogether in June 2007. The property will then revert to the Department of Education. A major reunion of past pupils and teachers, covered by the press and national TV, was held in mid-February 2007. There was some controversy about the closure, for reasons including the pending arrival of more than 2,500 homes within of Kilbarrack (many in Balgriffin and Baldoyle), the school's widely recognised work in education in a challenging environment, and the non-closure of what some see as less-progressive, non co-educational schools nearby. As of April 2007, it was announced that the school premises would continue to be used for educational purposes. Staff Former teachers at the school include playwright and film director Paul Mercier, Booker Prize winner Roddy Doyle, and Catherine Dunne, and former Dublin Football midfielder Brian Mullins. Artistic director of the Passion Machine Theatre Company Paul Mercier later stated that \\"Things are changing at a furious pace. But in reality things are disappearing in society that were working. And Greendale was working.\\" The principal of the school from opening to closure was Anton Carroll.

The company was set up by John Brown and Company with the aim of purchasing Roundwood Colliery at Parkgate and to purchase land between Thrybergh and Ravenfield, known as Silverwood, and sink a new deep colliery there. By the time production was in full swing at Silverwood in 1909 John Brown were sole proprietors of the Dalton Main Company. Early history The name \\"Aldwarke\\" refers to an area in the Don Valley about 2 miles north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire stretching to the outskirts of the village of Kilnhurst. To its west is Parkgate, to its east the villages of Dalton and Thrybergh. The washlands of the river Don (known locally as \\"The Wash\\") was crossed by a toll road which was freed of toll in the late 1980s. Coal gathering at Aldwarke goes back to the 17th century with documents relating to tenants rights of way over the grounds and the river Dunne (Don) at Aldwarke ford, on both sides of river; and to any person fetching coals from pits. Earlier records still refer to charkcole (charcoal) to be cut in Rounde woodde near Aldwarke Manor house. Deeper Mining In 1880 John Brown and Company Limited were listed as being the owners of Aldwarke Main at Parkgate. This colliery dated from 1867 and worked the Barnsley Seam, this being deepened to the Parkgate Seam some 10 years later. The second shaft was sunk to reach the Silkstone Seam in 1884. In 1880 a neighbouring colliery at Roundwood, Parkgate, near Rotherham was listed as being owned by Cooper, Sellars and Company. Sixteen years later the owners were recorded as being the Roundwood Colliery Company. This was the colliery which was purchased by John Brown and Company and became the foundation of the Dalton Main Collieries Company. The Roundwood and Dalton Colliery Limited was registered in 1898 and as the Dalton Main Collieries Limited became a public company which was floated on the London Stock Exchange in December 1899. The main purpose of the company was to buy out the business of Roundwood Colliery, purchase land at Silverwood, between Thrybergh and Ravenfield, and sink a new deep colliery there. The collieries at Roundwood, Silverwood were to be connected by a railway, known as John Brown's Private Railway, via the boat staithe, but with no main line connections. This was built by the colliery company, which had been bought by steelmaker John Brown, because the railway companies were unwilling to take on the work with, initially, little or no return. Once coal was being drawn from Silverwood the attitude of the railways changed and they were willing the take over the line as part of the Rotherham, Laughton and Maltby Railway which later became part of the Great Central and Midland Joint Railway from which time it gained main line connections. The collieries at Roundwood and Silverwood were connected underground in 1908.

Records is an American independent comedy record label founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by Grammy-winning producer Dan Schlissel. It has been called \\"the country's most respected indie comedy label.\\" Stand Up! has released more than 200 comedy albums and videos since its founding in 2000, including albums by Lewis Black, Patton Oswalt, Greg Proops, David Cross, Maria Bamford, Hannibal Buress, Judy Gold, the Sklar Brothers, and Eddie Pepitone. Comedian and actor Marc Maron, who released his first three albums on Stand Up!, described Schlissel as \\"a guy who loves comedy, and is very attentive to the process of recording comedy,\\" and, referencing the large number of noteworthy comics who were given important exposure in their early careers by the label, joked that \\"you've done everybody's first two records.\\" A relatively small operation, the label is run almost entirely by Schlissel, who also served as recording engineer and producer on many of the label's albums. The label has been praised for bringing an independent approach to the comedy genre, inspired by Schlissel's roots in punk and indie rock. Henry Owings, founder of humor magazine Chunklet, stated that Schlissel \\"has done a great job trying to reintroduce some fresh blood into comedy albums. ‚Ä¶ If anybody's trying to bring back the idea of comedy albums being something that should be looked at in the same light as a music album, it's him.\\"  History  In the 1990s, Schlissel founded the Lincoln, Nebraska-based -ismist Recordings, which released works by Midwestern punk, metal and alt-rock bands such as Killdozer and House of Large Sizes, including Iowa metal band Slipknot's 1997 debut/demo, Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat. After Slipknot left -ismist for Roadrunner Records, Schlissel became disillusioned with running a music label, and moved away from Nebraska in 1998 to take a job at a software company in Minneapolis. He considered folding -ismist, but instead found new focus after convincing Lewis Black to work with him after meeting the comedian after a show in Minneapolis. Schlissel recorded Black's The White Album in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1999, with John Machnik, who would be his production partner for many years. Released on -ismist, the album was an immediate success, eventually selling around 60,000 copies, more than the entire previous -ismist catalog combined. Schlissel reinvented -ismist entirely, moving from punk rock to comedy. The label released several other comedy albums, including two by Doug Stanhope, Sicko and Something to Take the Edge Off, and Jimmy Shubert's Animal Instincts, while Schlissel launched Stand Up! Records in 2000. By 2002, -ismist had effectively closed down and been replaced by Stand Up! Records. Black's next album, the post-9/11 The End of the Universe, sold similarly well. Even after Black moved to the larger Comedy Central Records label, he continued to work with Schlissel, who produced or edited four more Black albums in the mid-2000s, Rules of Enragement, Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues, The Carnegie Hall Performance, and Anticipation. Of these, Carnegie Hall won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, while Luther Burbank and Anticipation were both nominated in that category. Stand Up! also released the vinyl editions of Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues and Rules of Enragement.  Notable releases = Original productions  Stand Up!'s original works include: * Besides Black's White Album, the label also released a 2002 set of White Album outtakes called Revolver (continuing the Beatles title theme), and the 2002 album The End of the Universe. * Stand Up! released five albums by Doug Stanhope: 2000's Sicko and Something to Take the Edge Off, 2002's Die Laughing, 2007's Deadbeat Hero, and 2009's From Across The Street, as well as the Unbookables' Morbid Obscenity, a 2006 benefit CD led by Stanhope to raise money for fellow comic Arthur Hinty's gastric bypass surgery. * In addition to re-releasing Maron's debut Not Sold Out, Schlissel recorded and produced Maron's second and third albums, 2006's Tickets Still Available and 2009's Final Engagement, and released a best-of compilation of Maron's podcast WTF with Marc Maron in 2010. * Schlissel recorded and produced Maria Bamford's first two albums, 2003's The Burning Bridges Tour and 2007's How to WIN!, as well as the 2010 live DVD Plan B. * Whose Line Is It Anyway?' star Greg Proops released two albums on the label in 2007, Houston, We Have a Problem and Joke Book. * Cheap Seats stars The Sklar Brothers released three albums on the label, 2004's Poppin' the Hood! and the 2011 albums Sklar Maps and Hendersons and Daughters. * Emmy-winning comic Judy Gold released her 2004 debut album Judith's Roommate Had a Baby on Stand Up!. * Hannibal Buress's 2010 debut My Name Is Hannibal * 2007's Caffeinated, the sole comedy album by Jonathan Katz, star of animated sitcom Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist Stand Up! also often partners with comics who have already self-released an album to re-release it in an expanded edition with broader distribution. Examples include Maron's debut Not Sold Out and Pepitone's A Great Stillness.  Vinyl and collectors' editions  Stand Up! releases albums via digital download and streaming, CD and vinyl. Although vinyl remains a niche market with minimal profit margins compared with digital and streaming, Schlissel told an interviewer for Roctober magazine that he continues to support the format because \\"the physical product matters. I want me and my artists to have something to hold in hand and say, 'I did this!'\\" The label's dedication to vinyl has been credited with helping a resurgence in the format; Don Steinberg of the Wall Street Journal stated that Stand Up! has given comedy on vinyl \\"a hipster comeback,\\" while John Wenzel of Vulture lauded the label for \\"honoring the history of the format.\\" The vinyl picture-disc edition of Black's End of the Universe was autographed by Black before manufacturing; his signature is part of the vinyl art, under the grooves. Dana Gould, former co-executive producer of The Simpsons, re-released three discs on vinyl with Stand Up!: Funhouse, Let Me Put My Thoughts in You and I Know It's Wrong. For the 2009 re-release of Funhouse, the label also made an 8-track tape version as well as CD and vinyl. Stand Up! often works with larger labels to co-release collector's-edition vinyl versions of a comic's album. Besides the two Lewis Black albums, Stand Up! also released LPs of David Cross's Grammy-nominated 2002 album Shut Up You Fucking Baby and the subsequent It's Not Funny and ...America...Great..., as well as Patton Oswalt's Feelin' Kinda Patton and Werewolves and Lollipops, Hannibal Buress' Animal Furnace, and Kyle Kinane's Death of the Party. In 2015, the label re-released Joan Rivers' groundbreaking 1968 The Next To Last Joan Rivers Album for Record Store Day; it had long been out of print.  Philosophy and approach to comedy  The name \\"Stand Up!\\" was chosen not only for its obvious connection with stand-up comedy, but for its association with free-thinking and revolutionary ideals, as in the Bob Marley song \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\" and the intellectually confrontational comedic approach of George Carlin, Lenny Bruce and Joan Rivers. The label's logo, a clenched fist holding a microphone aloft, was designed by street artist and activist Shepard Fairey in 2002. Rather than sticking to a single style of comedy, Stand Up! maintains a diverse set of styles and viewpoints among its artists. Political material on the label ranges from libertarian Tim Slagle to moderate Will Durst to the left-leaning Black and Maron. Reflecting the label's interest in edgy, punk-inflected comedy and Schlissel's roots in indie rock, Stand Up! often works with visual artists who share that sensibility, such as Fairey and Frank Kozik. MAD magazine cartoonists Jack Davis and Mort Drucker drew the covers for albums by Tim Slagle and Dwight York, while Raymond Pettibon, the iconic punk artist who created many of Black Flag's album covers, drew the cover for J.T. Habersaat‚Äôs Hostile Corporate Takeover. Derek Riggs, who designed Iron Maiden's albums, did the cover for Glenn Wool's No Land's Man. Wendy Pini, creator of the Elfquest comic-book series, illustrated the cover of Keith Lowell Jensen's album Elf Orgy. Cartoonist Drew Friedman illustrated the 2014 vinyl edition of Eddie Pepitone's A Great Stillness. Pia Guerra, Eisner Award-winning co-creator of Y: The Last Man, drew the cover for Ray Harrington's 2017 album Overwhelmed.  Ties with Minneapolis and Austin  In addition to its roster of nationally known comedians, the label also has particularly strong ties with the regional comedy scenes in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Austin, Texas. Minnesotan comics on the label include Bamford, Mary Mack, Tim Harmston, Corey Adam, \\"Fancy Ray\\" McCloney, and Rich Kronfeld of Comedy Central's Let's Bowl, and Stand Up! has also released two DVDs of the Twin Cities public-access cable series Drinking With Ian. In Austin, the label has put on multiple showcases at the annual SXSW festival, and has produced albums by Austin comedians including Andy Ritchie, David Huntsberger, J.T. Habersaat, John Tole, Doug Mellard, and Ryan Cownie. In 2019, Stand Up! released the posthumous album by Austin's Lashonda Lester, Shondee Superstar, which was praised by Paste magazine as \\"a lovely introduction to a voice that‚Äôs both purely unique and universally relatable ... If the world is only lucky enough to have one album from Lester, it's a blessing that it's a recording of a complete show.\\"  Other works = Roku channel  Stand Up! has a streaming channel available on Roku featuring new and archival comedy videos and podcasts.  Akumal Comedy Festival  From 2012 to 2015, Stand Up! hosted the annual Akumal Comedy Festival in Mexico, a nonprofit event held in Tulum, Playa del Carmen, and Akumal which raised money for the Mexican Red Cross. The festival featured comics performing in both English and Spanish. Headliners included Darryl Lenox, Maggie Faris, and Derek Sheen. The festival was co-founded by Schlissel and Twin Cities comic Gus Lynch, who also acted in the films Saving Silverman, North Country, and I Spy. Lynch died after an accidental fall in Akumal in 2014; the final festival was held in his honor. Scottish tartan In 2018, during the label's first visit to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Schlissel registered a Scottish tartan with the National Records of Scotland in the name of Stand Up! Records. Designed by Edinburgh kiltmaker Gordon Nicolson, the tartan blends the colors red, black, and tan (from Fairey's Stand Up! Records logo), blue (from the Israeli flag, symbolizing Schlissel‚Äôs Jewish heritage), and silver-grey (for -ismist Recordings' 25th anniversary).  Discography  All releases from 2000 and 2001 were originally issued by -ismist Recordings, the predecessor to Stand Up! Records. When the titles were repressed, starting in early 2002, the branding was switched to the Stand Up! Records imprint. All titles from 2002 onward were originally issued by Stand Up! Records, unless under license from another label, or bringing an out of print release back into print. 2000 *SUR 001 - Lewis Black - The White Album (CD, vinyl LP) *SUR 002 - Doug Stanhope - Sicko *SUR 003 - Doug Stanhope - Something to Take the Edge Off (CD, vinyl LP) 2001 *SUR 004 - Jimmy Shubert - Animal Instincts 2002 *SUR 005 - Lewis Black - Revolver (5\\" CD EP, 10\\" vinyl EP, including 3\\" CD EP) *SUR 006 - Lewis Black - The End of the Universe (CD, vinyl picture disc) *SUR 007 - Doug Stanhope - Die Laughing *SUR 008 - Rich Kronfeld - Factory Accident Sex (DVD) *SUR 009 - David Cross - Shut Up, You Fucking Baby!

The Act made it high treason to \\"within the realm or without compass, imagine, invent, devise or intend death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim or wounding, imprisonment or restraint, of the person of ... the King\\". This was derived from the Sedition Act 1661, which had expired. The 1795 Act was originally a temporary Act which was to expire when George III died, but it was made permanent by the Treason Act 1817. Some other treasons created by the Act (which also originated with the 1661 Act) were reduced to felonies by the Treason Felony Act 1848, which also extended the 1795 Act to Ireland. The Act also stipulated that anyone found to have brought either the King, the Constitution or the government into contempt could be transported for a period of 7 years.J. Cannon, Parliamentary Reform 1640-1832 This clause was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1871. The rest of the Act was repealed by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

Investigators state that they recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder on the day of the accident and studied them to determine the cause of the accident. Prosecutors investigating the crash in Samara said bad weather and pilot error were the most likely causes. Initial analysis of the flight data recorder suggests the aircraft was not experiencing any obvious technical malfunction before the accident. Russia's interstate aviation committee MAK states a preliminary assessment shows both engines were operating up to the point of impact. The aircraft was in landing configuration, with the undercarriage lowered and the flaps positioned at 30 degrees, and did not suffer fire or other damage while airborne.Flight International 27 March 2007 According to the findings of the official MAK investigation,MAK investigation conclusion (Russian) the crash can be blamed on both the airport services, which did not inform the pilot about the reduced visibility in time due to organizational problems, and on the pilot, who did not give the dispatcher the correct information about his landing trajectory and, consequently, did not decide to stop the landing procedure and try to take another approach at the time he should have done so. UTair's reaction Within hours of the crash, UTair issued a statement saying that the aircraft had been in good technical condition and that foggy weather was likely to have caused the accident. The company also said the crew was well-skilled and had long experience.Weather, technical, human factors considered Tu-134 crash versions - RIA Novosti - Obtained March 17, 2007.

Hypotheticals deal with the concept of \\"what if?\\"'. Grammatically, the term is a noun formed from an adjective, and the word might be pluralized because it refers to the members of a class of hypothetical things. Hypotheticals are important because they provide a means for understanding what we would do if the world was different. Although this assists our understanding of risk, and helps us plan and create a new and better future, hypotheticals also help us understand the past, and why things happened or how things work. For example, in seeking to understand why a war started we could ask: \\"What if the parties had talked more first? Would they have worked out a better way of solving their problems? Could war have been averted?\\" Hypotheticals about the past are challenging to consider, as it is not possible to enter the past to change things according to our hypotheticals and determine what then may have occurred. The philosopher David Lewis suggested in his book Counterfactuals (Blackwell Publishers, 1973) that when we use hypotheticals (\\"counter-to-fact-uals\\"), what we mean is: \\"In an imaginary world, exactly like ours, except in the one difference we are talking about ...\\". This idea is called \\"possible worlds\\" and some people believe they actually exist, only we can't get to them, because the whole point is that they are different from our world.

In 2016 the population was 4,954. History An A380 landing at Finkenwerder airport, with the local church below Neuenfelde as Nincop was first mentioned in 1257 as a village of Dutch settlers. In 1937 due to the Greater Hamburg Act Neuenfelde became a part of Hamburg. The survival of the settlement is currently under threat from the nearby Airbus factory and its airport. Over the past few years, Airbus extended their runway towards Neuenfelde. This upset local residents, many of whom have had to sell their properties in order to accommodate these plans. Another source of upset was the planned relocation of the local St. Pankratius church, home to a historic Baroque organ built by Arp Schnitger.

Biography Jones was born on 15 August 1923 in Invercargill. He was one of six brothers and two sisters and the only one of the brothers to complete primary school, although he left secondary school shortly before his 15th birthday. From that point on he held a number of short-term jobs, working principally as a farm labourer before he joined the New Zealand Army in 1941 after lying about his age. He served as a private in the 23rd Infantry Battalion during World War II and lost his right leg to tank-fire at the age of 19 in North Africa. After his war service he attended Otago and Victoria Universities and Dunedin Teachers' College. He taught at Wanganui for some time before returning south to become assistant master at Southland College. Subsequently he worked at James Hargest High School and at Southland Boys' High School. Jones and his wife Marjorie were committee members of the Save Manapouri campaign. Jones was an Invercargill city councillor for 18 years, and served one term as deputy mayor. In the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services, for services to civil defence and the community. He became particularly notable for his vehement opposition to the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986. Owing to his outspokenness on this and other issues, the media dubbed him \\"the mouth from the south\\". When the Labour Party won office in 1984, an economic summit took place in the parliamentary debating chamber. Representatives from industry, unions and community groups attended. Jones refused to vacate his seat, saying he would not give up his chair for some communist to sit down. Jones first stood for Parliament at a by-election in 1945. He had contested seven elections before being chosen as the National candidate for Invercargill in , when he beat the incumbent Labour representative, J. B. Munro. He remained in Parliament until shortly before his death in 1987. Jones died on 19 November 1987 from a brain tumour at the age of 64. His autobiography, Jonesy, published five years earlier in 1982, detailed his wartime service and his political career. A number of the most controversial aspects and events of his public service occurred after the book's publication.

The plaintiff, Rene Joly, filed a lawsuit in that was dismissed by Justice Epstein as frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court. Lawsuits= Rulings  Joly's filed suit against the Canadian Government (specifically Art Eggleton), Citibank, Shoppers Drug Mart and many others. Joly even formally submitted a \\"well prepared, thoughtful\\" argument that his DNA tests, which would prove he was not human, had been falsified. Supposedly, he was cloned from debris found on Mars by NASA in the 1960s. Judge Epstein found no reason for Joly not to stand trial or to represent himself: :I made the observation that in every respect Mr. Joly properly conducted himself before the Court. He presented himself as polite, articulate, intelligent and appeared to understand completely the issues before the Court and the consequences should I grant the relief sought. Thus, Judge Epstein proceeded with the case, and following a motion filed by the defense, dismissed the case as frivolous and vexatious, explaining: :Rule 1.03 defines plaintiff as \\"a person who commences an action\\". The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines person as \\"an individual human being\\". Section 29 of the Interpretation Act provides that a person includes a corporation. It follows that if the plaintiff is not a person in that he is neither a human being nor a corporation, he cannot be a plaintiff as contemplated by the Rules of Civil Procedure. The entire basis of Mr. Joly's actions is that he is a martian, not a human being. There is certainly no suggestion that he is a corporation. I conclude therefore, that Mr. Joly, on his pleading as drafted, has no status before the Court.

Based on the written work of Yumeaki Hirayama, it is the directorial debut of Yoshihiro Hoshino. The full Japanese title is Extremely Scary Story A: Dark Crow, and is the first theatrical release of the Cho Kowai Hanashi series. The story centres on a haunted convenience store, the disturbing effect it has on the owners and other local residents, and the grisly deaths of the customers who shop there. Plot Two high school students arrive at the Mitsuya convenience store. One of the students, Yuko, proclaims she cannot enter the shop. However, she backs away too far and is killed by a truck. Some time later, Ryouko Kagami, a representative of the Cosmo Mart chain, seeks to purchase the store on behalf of her boss, Tejima. She explains to the shop owners, Mr. and Mrs. Kitura, that Tejima could not be present because of an accident in which his feet were amputated, to which the Kituras react with amusement. As Ryouko begins doing an inventory of the store, she befriends a part-time employee named Nao Niigaki. A customer in a hooded coat comes in and starts reading a magazine. Nao tries to get a good look at his face, but can only see darkness. Later, a man comes in and makes a purchase for 666 yen. While walking home, the man encounters a white ball which has rolled from a dark alley. He picks it up and walks into the alley where a voice asks him to return the ball. He walks into the darkness, disappears, and the ball is bounced outside again. While Nao sorts the drinks in the freezer, she sees a pair of eyes staring back at her. Meanwhile, Ryouko finds a product that expired three years previously. She questions the Kituras, who blankly continue staring in a CCTV camera. Two crows crash into the window, killing themselves. Nao and Ryouko go to outside to investigate, where the Kituras are somehow already present and hosing away the crow remains, laughing madly. That night, a man and woman make purchases for 699 yen and 999 yen respectively. On the way home, the woman is stalked by a man with a sledgehammer, who eventually appears inside her apartment and attacks her. The next day, Ryouko receives a call from Tejima, who tells her \\"everyone has feet\\" before the signal cuts to static. After dark, the night clerk, Komori, serves the hooded man. The till registers 44.44444 yen, and Komori looks up to find only blackness in the hood. The man then forces Komori's head inside the hood. Komori comes out in shock and panic. Ryouko arrives and sees that one of Komori's eyes has monstrously bulged out of his sockets. Ryouko takes over Komori's shift and charges a woman 666 yen. A man is initially charged 907 yen until he is hypnotized by steamed buns; he buys one and the price changes to 999. That night, the woman cooks food for her boyfriend when a blackout occurs. She opens her fridge to find a long corridor from which a pale girl emerges. The girl approaches the woman and tricks her into fatally stabbing her boyfriend, before the woman is suffocated by a bag over her head. Meanwhile, the man visits a bathhouse. Witnessing strange phenomena in the bath, he attempts to leave when he slips on mysterious hair and is knocked unconscious. When he wakes up, the man is attacked and killed by the elderly clerk of the bathhouse. He grabs the man's steamed bun and eats it while watching the television. That same night, Nao is standing at a railroad crossing when the hooded man appears and tries to pull her toward the passing train. She resists until the train passes and the hooded man disappears. The following day, Nao finds a homeless woman who tells her to come with her to learn more about the store. Nao and the woman are joined by Ryouko at the park. The woman reveals that the store's owner mistreated his contractor when it was being built. The contractor, in anger, broke apart the tombstones of people without families and used the fragments to build the store's foundation, resulting in its haunting. Ryouko tells Nao to stop working there. Nao comes to the store and saves Komori from a ghost in the bathroom. Komori, regaining his sanity, runs out of the store where, in the sun, he baptizes himself in the river. He throws away his jacket, regains his composure, and leaves with Nao. Ryouko, walking toward the store to work, finds a wheelchair rolling down the hill. Her boss Temija tells her every ghost does not have feet and he is happy. Ryouko thanks him and walks away. The movie goes back to the beginning, now shot from Yuko's point of view, where she sees the tortured souls inside the store.

The seat in the state assembly of Malacca, Malaysia, fell vacant after the incumbent, Datuk Wira Poh Ah Tiam of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), died on 15 March that year. On 21 March 2007, the Election Commission of Malaysia (EC) announced 3 April 2007 as the nomination day and 12 April 2007 the election date. The MCA candidate, Lai Meng Chong eventually defeated the opposition candidate of Liou Chen Kuang, with a reduced majority compared to the previous 2004 election. Background State assembly seat N.08 Machap lies in parliamentary seat P.135 Alor Gajah. As of the 2004 General Elections, Machap was a majority Chinese seat (45.6%), followed by Malays (38.3%), Indians (15.3%) and others (0.7%). In the 2004 election, the late Datuk Wira Poh Ah Tiam of the MCA, a component party of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, garnered 5,847 votes, defeating Liou Chen Kuang of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) (1,285 votes) by a majority of 4,562 votes. Candidates= Pre-nomination speculation  The English language daily The Star reported on 17 March 2007 that the opposition People's Justice Party (PKR) was the first to express interest in contesting the seat, with its information chief Tian Chua as the likely candidate. Meanwhile, on 20 March 2007, the Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS) declared it would not field a candidate in the by-election, citing the fact that the seat has traditionally been a DAP versus BN contest. The DAP and the ruling BN declined to comment on their plans until after Poh's funeral on 21 March 2007.EC to set polls date on March 21 . (17 March 2007). Malaysia Today. Nonetheless, this did not stop the media from speculating. Those linked to Datuk Seri Dr Fong Chan Onn, the Malaysian Minister of Human Resources, MP for Alor Gajah and MCA vice-president, were named as possible BN candidates. The list included Fong's special assistant Ngow Dow Soon, his political secretary Lai Meng Chong and his private secretary Chew Chong Lin. From the opposition camp, besides PKR's Tian Chua, potential candidates from the DAP include Liou Chen Kuang, whom Poh had beaten in the last general election, or Tey Kok Kiew, special assistant to the party's secretary-general Lim Guan Eng. On 22 March 2007, PKR and DAP reached an agreement, whereby PKR will yield the seat to DAP in the by-election, but will contest the seat in the next General Elections. PKR has also agreed to provide support to DAP but will not be directly involved in campaigning. Meanwhile, MCA president Datuk Seri Ong Ka Ting announced on 26 March 2007 that an MCA Presidential Council meeting on 27 March 2007 will choose the BN's candidate. The chosen candidate will be revealed after obtaining formal approval from the BN chairman, incumbent Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Nominated candidates The DAP candidate was Liou Chen Kuang (centre, foreground, without cap). On 30 March 2007, the DAP announced its candidate for the seat in the 2004 General Elections, 33-year-old Liou Chen Kuang, will contest in the by-election. Liou, a businessman, was chosen again despite losing in the last election. He was chosen due to his \\"knowledge of the local terrain\\", grassroots support, and his willingness \\"to serve Machap constituents\\". The DAP also announced it would use the slogan Machap Demokrasi (Machap Democracy) to raise awareness among voters on the importance of democracy in Malaysia. Three days later, on 2 April 2007, the BN deputy chairman and incumbent Deputy Prime Minister Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak named a local MCA politician, 56-year-old Lai Meng Chong as the coalition's candidate for the by-election. Nomination day scuffle Groups of supporters from parties on both sides, such as the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), were involved in scuffles. During nomination day on 3 April 2007, a scuffle occurred between DAP and BN supporters. Two DAP supporters were injured in the scuffle, which erupted after some name-calling and sloganeering.Puah, P., \\"Scuffle mars nomination day\\", The Sun, 4 April 2007 Following the incident, police arrested a man after receiving four reports, two from the injured man, and two each from a journalist and a photographer from the Tamil dailies Malaysian Nanban and Makkal Osai, respectively. Issues= Election irregularities  The opposition parties had alleged that the country's election process was not transparent and could be manipulated. However, the EC chairman, Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman on 21 March 2007 denied the allegations and challenged political parties to take the commission to court on the matter. Despite the denial, the DAP described the EC's move of not fixing the elections on a weekend as an \\"act of biasness to benefit the BN\\". On 27 March 2007, as an attempt to counter the opposition's grievances on the transparency of the election process, the EC announced that new, translucent plastic ballot boxes will be used in the by-elections, replacing the black metal ballot boxes used in previous elections. According to the EC, the new box is also lighter at only 500 grams, as compared to the metal box, which weighed 1.5 kg. Opposition boycott Due to alleged irregularities in the Malaysian election process, two major opposition parties, PAS and DAP, boycotted the January 2007 Batu Talam State by-election in Pahang, which the BN won after defeating an independent candidate. DAP's decision to now contest in Machap has led the BN to accuse opposition parties of being \\"inconsistent\\" with regards to boycotting elections. Chinese support for the BN Some pundits opine that the Machap by-election, given the constituency's ethnic composition, may reflect support from the Chinese community for the ruling BN.Hong, C., \\"By-election will be test of Chinese support for KL govt\\", The Straits Times, 23 March 2007 Many Chinese voters abandoned the BN in the 2006 Sarawak state elections, BN's worst showing in a long time in the traditionally safe state, whereby nine seats, seven of which were predominantly Chinese, went to the opposition. The dissatisfaction was because of economic issues and a renewed push by some Malay BN politicians for more privileges under the Malaysian New Economic Policy. A December 2006 survey by independent social research outfit the Merdeka Centre, found that 60% of Chinese voters nationwide were open to voting for the opposition. Some pundits argue the by-election might not reflect the purported general sentiments of the Chinese. They believe that the DAP faces an uphill battle against the incumbent BN, as Machap is a rural constituency whereby local concerns predominate national issues and constituents are more conservative and less receptive to change. Furthermore, the deceased Datuk Wira Poh Ah Tiam was popular and had a good service record in Machap, having served for three consecutive terms and bringing tangible development in the constituency. Alleged DAP-PAS secret co-operation pact The day before the election, Malaysiakini reported that BN had distributed 1,000 VCDs containing a video clip of a campaigner from the PKR stating that a vote for the DAP would be a vote for the Barisan Alternatif, a coalition comprising PKR and PAS. The DAP was a former member of the coalition, but pulled out after disagreement on PAS' advocacy of an Islamic state. MCA vice-president Datuk Seri Dr Fong Chan Onn alleged the video was proof of the DAP's covert co-operation with PAS, and stated that BN had \\"to let the people in Machap know that voting for DAP will help realise PAS' plan to turn Malaysia into a theocratic state\\". The EC also stated that 50 PAS party flags had been removed, as PAS was not contesting the by-election. The DAP alleged that the flags had not been put up by PAS, and claimed that BN supporters had raised them. Confronted by the media on the DAP's claims, Fong denied any knowledge of such actions, calling it \\"just speculation\\". Election day Voter turnout was low in the morning, reaching only 23% by 11.00 am. However, turnout picked up at lunchtime, hitting 59.2% by 3.00pm. Weather conditions were generally favorable throughout the day with only scattered showers in late afternoon, which resulted in the relatively high turnout of 74.4% at the 5.00 pm close. However, the day was marred by allegations of vote-buying against the BN made by the DAP. According to a DAP party worker, a tip-off was received by the party at around 12.00 pm that a vacant house was used to disburse vote-buying money. Voters were alleged to have received as much as RM200 (ca. US$58) from BN operatives. However, in an immediate reaction, MCA president Dato' Seri Ong Ka Ting brushed off the allegation, calling the DAP's allegations baseless and made for \\"political mileage\\". Post-election controversy In a post-election analysis, senior DAP leader Tony Pua alleged that although BN and Lai had been caught in the act offering to renovate houses and passing out free food and drinks, in direct contravention of electoral laws, the Election Commission had taken no action. The DAP later filed a complaint with the EC over the alleged vote- buying incidents, including claims that the government had announced development projects to secure support. The EC chairman rejected the latter allegation, stating that such actions were legal and within the government's discretion. MCA president Ong also rejected the claims, saying it was common for the opposition to make such allegations after electoral defeats, and accused the DAP of being contradictory in first blaming the government for not developing Machap, but later saying the development was vote-buying.

She was the first woman ever appointed as scientist aboard any British or Spanish exploration ships. She discovered 22 new species of marine animals and published over a hundred scientific books, chapters and articles. In her late career she studied the history of early marine scientific exploration. Early days Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Alvari√±o Gonzalez was born in Serantes (Ferrol, Galicia) on October 3, 1916. She was the daughter of the medical doctor Dr. Antonio Alvari√±o Grimaldos and Maria del Carmen Gonzalez Diaz-Saavedra. From an early age she showed an interest in the natural sciences and read her father's book on zoology. She attended the lyc√©e Concepcion Arenal in Ferrol and in 1931 attended the University of Santiago de Compostela where she graduated summa cum laude in 1933. The titles of her dissertations were \\"Social Insects\\" and \\"Women in Don Quixote\\".Angeles Alvari√±o.\\" Notable Hispanic American Women , Book 2, Gale Research, 1998 \\"Creativity and imagination are the basic ingredients for the scientists, as in the arts, because science is an art\\" ‚Äì She later explained when she was asked about her diverse interests. In 1934 she was admitted at the University of Madrid to study Natural Sciences, but had to interrupt her studies as a consequence of the Spanish Civil War. During this period she devoted herself to the study of English and French, which later proved very useful for the development of her research career in the United States.Borrazas, Carolina. √Ångeles Alvari√±o: Unha precusora na investigaci√≥n oceanogr√°fica mundial. Album de mulleres. Consello da Cultura Galega, Comisi√≥n de Igualdade. Santiago de Compostela. En 1940 she married Eugenio Leira Manso, captain of the Spanish War Navy and Knight of the Royal and Military Order of San Hermenegildo. Two years later their daughter was born, Maria de los Angeles Leira Alvari√±o, who is now a well-renowned architect and urbanist based in the US . After the war, √Ångeles Alvari√±o resumed her studies, and in 1941 she obtained her master's degree in Natural Sciences by the University of Madrid. √Ångeles √Ålvari√±o returned with her husband to Ferrol where she taught, from 1941 to 1948, biology, zoology, botany and geology as a professor at various colleges. In 1948 she moved back with her family to Madrid to work as a fishery research biologist with the Department of Sea Fisheries. Alvari√±o could not pursue further research studies at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in Madrid due to a dated Spanish law that prohibited women aboard Navy Spanish vessels. However, because she had outstanding academic credentials, she was allowed to take some courses and do some research. In 1951 she received a graduate diploma in Experimental Psychology, Analytical Chemistry and Plant Ecology from the University of Madrid. In 1950, she moved back to Galicia and worked at the Spanish Oceanographic Institute in Vigo. In 1953 she received a scholarship from the British Council to conduct research on zooplankton in the Marine Biological Association laboratory at Plymouth, England, under the direction of the well-respected experts in zooplankton Frederick S. Russell and Peter. C. Corbin. Zooplankton comprise the small floating animals in the ocean that serve as food for other animals and include jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones. These creatures had barely been studied before the 1960s, and she focused in three groups: the microscopic Chaetognatha, which are carnivorous and feed on other plankton; the colonial Sinophora, which cluster in groups of individuals of the same species (like the Portuguese Man'o'War); and the Medusa or jellyfish. By studying the plankton of the English Channel and in the Bay of Biscay, her work led to the discovered some anomalies in the distribution of plankton species which led to the scientific conclusion that the Atlantic waters had moved poleward in an unusual way. Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Alvari√±o was the first woman appointed as scientist aboard a British research vessel ever. Throughout her life she participated in several expeditions and scientific cruises in the Atlantic and Pacific, aboard oceanographic ships from England, America, Spain and Mexico. In 1954 Alvari√±o returned to Spain to continue her research on zooplankton. She designed special nets and recruited fishermen and naval research vessels to sample plankton for her in the Atlantic near Spain and near Newfoundland, and in the Mediterranean. In the USA In 1956, Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles received a fellowship from the Fulbright Commission to conduct scientific work at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, where she worked with Dr. Mary Sears, who was the president of the U.S. Oceanographic Congress and also a zooplankton researcher. Her career ramped up when Dr. Mary Sears, impressed with the quality of her research, recommended √Ångeles Alvari√±o to Dr. Roger Revelle, the director of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, part of the University of California at La Jolla, who offered her a position as a Biologist. She worked at La Jolla from 1958-69 where she studied the zooplankton off the coast of California as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. During this period she discovered 12 new Chaetognatha species, nine Sinophora and one medusa. She also produced a model of the world's distribution of different species of Chaetognatha and Siphonophora. This research formed the basis of her doctoral dissertation; she received a PhD from the University of Madrid in 1967. She received various grants from institutions such as the U.S. Office of the Navy, the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, and the US National Science Foundation. In January 1970, she was appointed a position as Fisheries Research Biologist at the prestigious Southwest Fisheries Science Center (which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Here she continued her research in Chaetognatha, Siphonophora, and studied the relationship between the predatory behavior of these organisms and the survival of fish larvae. She also studied the distribution of Chaetognatha and Siphonophora species in the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans, and plankton movement, in particular the effect of plancton introductions through pollution or ship movements. In the later 1970s, Alvari√±o worked to coordinate oceanic research among Latin American nations, and she studied the Antarctic. During this period she received various grants from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and from the United National Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). She retired as Emeritus Scientist in 1993 but continued to conduct research on seagoing vessels hosted by various countries. Toward the end of her life, √Ångeles Alvari√±o devoted herself to study the early history of scientific exploration. She looked closely into the scientific discoveries of early Spanish explorers and navigators who first mapped the oceans and their currents. As part of this investigations, she published a full account of the Malaspina Expedition, the first scientific oceanic expedition that traveled throughout the western Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean from 1789‚Äì94. Throughout her life, √Ångeles Alvari√±o also served as faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1976; at San Diego State University from 1979‚Äì82; and later, at the University of San Diego from 1982‚Äì85. She also was visiting professor at the Federal University of Paran√° in Brazil in 1982, and at the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico from 1982‚Äì86.

It lies within southern Fingal in the traditional County Dublin and it is partly in the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council and partly that of Fingal County Council. Balgriffin is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.Placenames Database of Ireland - Balgriffin civil parish Location Aerial photo showing Balgriffin, including Belmayne, in the immediate foreground, with the Donaghies housing estate and more of Donaghmede in the background Balgriffin is situated approximately from Dublin city centre. It is a civil parish of 540 acres in the barony of Coolock. For the purposes of elections to D√°il √âireann, it is part of the constituency of Dublin North-East. It is in the Dublin 13 postal district. The area's local government administration is split between Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council. Geography The two main branches of the Mayne River (sometimes referred to as the \\"Moyne\\"), the Turnapin Stream and the Cuckoo Stream, run through the plains of the district, picking up smaller streams. The Turnapin flows in the southern part of the area, coming from the old Belcamp Estate and running north of the main Belmayne development, while the Cuckoo comes east near Limekiln Lane and forms the northern boundary of the Fingal Burial Ground. Flooding sometimes hits Limekiln Lane. The Turnapin and the Cuckoo merge in eastern Balgriffin and the Mayne then flows out to Baldoyle Bay (Balgriffin Road becomes Moyne Road as it approaches the coast). Access and transport The hamlet of Balgriffin is served by Balgriffin Road from the east (Portmarnock), the R139 from Dublin Airport and Donaghmede on its southern edge, and by Malahide Road from the north (Kinsealy and Malahide) and south (Dublin city centre, Fairview and Coolock). Dublin Bus provides the district of Balgriffin with services on the 15, 42 and 43 routes, Dublin Bus Timetables 42, 43, 128 the cemeteries being served by the 42 and 43. History Balgriffin is an old district that can be found on maps, many held in Dublin City Archive and Dublin County Archive, going back hundreds of years. In 1388 Robert Burnell, judge of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), was lord of the manor of Balgriffin; his descendants who were also lords of the manor of Castleknock, were still at Balgriffin in the seventeenth century. Historically, it has remained as a lightly settled area of fields with a hamlet at a crossroads, at which now stands an 18th-century public house, some cottages, a village green and hall, and two cemeteries - the older of which is to the west, the newer, civic, one to the east. Balgriffin Cemetery Fingal Cemetery In 1542 King Henry VIII of England granted Conn Bacach O'Neill an estate in Balgriffin as a part of the Surrender and Regrant settlement that created the former King of Tir Eoghan the newly designated 1st Earl of Tyrone.\\"Sir Sidney's Memoirs of his government in Ireland 1583\\" ULSTER JOURNAL OF ARCHEOLOGY First Series, Volume III, 1885. Pg. 46, footnote #6 The best known feature of the area is the early St Doulagh's Church; it is also said that magnate de Burgo (Burke) had a base close by. Development Until recent years a small rural settlement, Balgriffin experienced several developments, including St. Samson's and Castlemoyne, and most notably the substantial one called Belmayne, infamous for its provocative advertising, and which remains unfinished.Dublin, Ireland: The Irish Times , retrieved Feb 23 2012 This development was, in February 2011, the subject of urgent fire safety works, but without the evacuation of residents experienced in nearby Priory Hall, Donaghmede.Dublin, Ireland: The Irish Times , retrieved Feb 23 2012 Amenities The historic pub has been joined over the last decade by shops and eating facilities in southern Balgriffin. Features Approximately north of the hamlet of Balgriffin is St Doulagh's Church. St Doulagh's Church (Dublin City Council) At first a monastery, it is now a well known and much revered Church of Ireland church. It was built in the 5th century and renovated in the 12th century. At the time of its inception, the Welsh Saint Samson made pilgrimage to Dun Etair () (Contemporary Howth) and is said to have founded the monastery that is now St Doulagh's Church.The life of St Samson of Dol by Thomas Taylor (Kessinger Publishing, LLC (July 25, 2007)): CNRS The emergence of monasticism: from the Desert Fathers to the early Middle Ages By Marilyn Dunn (Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2003): CNRS ) The church was originally under the patronage of St. Samson. As Balgriffin was in the past referred to as Ballygriffin and Griffinstown, the place name indicates that it was indeed settled by a Welsh person. Irish Saints of November: Duilech of Clochar MEMOIR OF THE CHURCH OF ST. DUILECH Religion St Doulagh's Church, Balgriffin has been serving Anglican parishioners since the Reformation in Ireland. Donaghmede Parish served Balgriffin Roman Catholic parishioners since its inception in 1974, with a Mass hall and then Holy Trinity Church. Holy Trinity Church, Donaghmede-Clongriffin-Balgriffin Parish The parish is today known as Holy Trinity Parish and serves Donaghmede including Clongriffin, and Balgriffin including Belmayne. With the growth of population as the Belmayne housing development was populated, Balgriffin Mass Centre was opened, operating from the information centre on Belmayne Avenue, but this no longer functions.

One of the first Indo-Fijians to gain a formal education, he was chosen as one of the representatives of the Indian community on a number of occasions. He helped form and supported a number of social and religious organisations. He also served one term as a nominated member in the Legislative Council.  Early life  Born in Madras, Buksh emigrated to Fiji in 1910, where he worked as an interpreter and clerk.Mr. M.S. Buksh Pacific Islands Monthly, August 1967, p138 He was one of the early group of Indi-Fijians to acquire sufficient formal education to be employed in government service. In 1922, Buksh, together with Odin Ramrakha and Vishnu Deo, helped the Raju Commission that made inquiries into the conditions of the Indian community in Fiji. In 1924, he was one of the founding members of the Indian Reform League, the first social and sporting organisation formed for Fiji Indians. He was also a founding member of the Fiji Muslim League in 1926. He worked for the Supreme Court of Fiji and as a repatriation officer. Although he retired in 1939, he returned to work for the civil service during World War II.  Involvement in politics  Buksh was a nominated member of the Legislative Council of Fiji in 1947, as an Indian nominated member by the Governor. He is remembered for an incident which caused a rift between A. D. Patel and Vishnu Deo. In 1948, when the Governor asked the five Indian members of the Legislative Council to elect one from amongst themselves to be a member of the Executive Council, A.D. Patel and Vishnu Deo both put forward their names. (The member elected into the Executive Council would have been recognised as the leader of the Indian community.) Ami Chandra supported Vishnu Deo, whereas James Madhavan, supported A.D. Patel. Buksh regarded both Patel and Deo as capable and could not make up his mind as to whom to support. Fully aware that Buksh did not regard himself as worthy of the position, A.D. Patel nominated him. Flattered with this support, Buksh returned the favour and threw his support behind Patel. Buksh said afterwards, \\"I garlanded him with the garland he offered me.\\"  Family life  He married Sarah Florence Whippy and had seven children, including Mirza. He left a daughter named Maikunnissa behind in India when he came to Fiji in 1910.

Because of a shallow, round depression carved in the center of the top surface, it may have been a cuauhxicalli or possibly a temalacatl. Richard Townsend maintains, however, that the depression was made in the 16th century for unknown purposes. The stone was rediscovered on 17 December 1791 when the Z√≥calo, the heart of downtown Mexico City, was being repaved. Workmen had been cutting cobblestone, and were about to cut up the carved monolith. A churchman named Gamboa happened to be passing by and saved the stone from the same result. The stone was then moved to the nearby Cathedral, and propped up vertically on one of the building's towers, where it stayed until 1824, when it was moved to the University. The stone is currently in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. The monolith is made of basalt and measures 93 cm tall with a diameter of 2.65 meters and a circumference of 8.31 meters. Features The Stone of Tizoc The lateral side of the stone depicts 15 separate scenes of a repeated scene of a costumed warrior having their hair grabbed by another warrior. Presumably the first figure, the warrior with the largest headress is identified by the glyph of Tizoc and wears the headdress of the deity Huitzilopotchli, the revered god of war. In each scene the warrior being grabbed has an identifying location glyph. Each of the warriors grabbing the other are identified with the 'smoking foot' motif as well as the symbol of the smoking mirror in their headdress both icons associating them with the deity Tezcatlipoca. Along the bottom of the rim are glyphs representing Tlaltecuhtli at each of the cardinal points, in between these glyphs are rows of tecpatl, sacrificial knives. Along the top of the rim are eyes and circular pieces of jade, symbols of Venus and the stars. The top of the stone has a sun diadem, with large triangles corresponding with the cardinal directions while smaller rays point in the inter-cardinal directions. The stone also features a large divot from the center to the edge of the sculpture. This divot is believed to have been done after the creation of the stone due to the rough and asymmetrical nature of the cut.  Interpretations  Top View of The Stone of Tizoc The act of grabbing another's hair has long been recognized as a symbol of defeat or conquering in Mesoamerica, as such the stone is interpreted to represent the conquest of other locations by the Mexica. The main interpretation is that the stone is a propaganda piece for Tizoc, the Aztec Emperor from 1481 to 1486; a rather weak emperor who did little to expand the empire. Aztec glyphs above each conquered soldier give the name of the original site which may have already been conquered. The toponyms are written in a mixture of logographic and syllabic signs. The stone also depicts the stars at the top rim, emphasizing the heavens; while the icons at the bottom edge represent the earth. Combined with the solar iconography on the top, this associates Aztec conquering and rule with the divine. While Tizoc is the only identifiable conqueror, each subsequent Mexica warrior shares the same 'smoking foot' motif to link them together. Some historians take this to mean that Tizoc is attempting to link his only large military conquest, depicted as the first scene, to the conquests of previous rulers. The fact that there are fifteen scenes could be related to the 15 lords of the 15 Mexica city-states, emphasizing the political and military divisions of the Mexica emperor. Richard Townsend argues that the relief may function as a symbolic manifestation of the Aztec empires tribute system. In relation to Mexica tradition, conquered tribes or cities were expected to send sacrificial offerings to the victor. Tizoc, head of the Aztec empire at the time, would therefore be the one collecting these tributes. The stone acts as acknowledgement of such a transaction. As a temalacatl, the stone may have been used for mock battles between a group of warriors and a victim who was tied to the stone and given a feathery club while the warriors had sharp macuahuitl. It is argued however, that temalactal are often described of as being flat on the top and the central hole lacks any kind of bar with which to tie a victim. More likely however, the stone was used as a cuauhxicalli, within the center of which the hearts of sacrificial victims were placed. It is argued that central hole likely had a face (like the Calendar Stone) which was later mutilated.

Precise information regarding taxation can be obtained from their website, as the percentages and manners of payment change regularly. In recent years, a percentage of proceeds from copyright licensing in France must be paid directly to the AGESSA by the party obtaining the license. For example, imagine that a script is licensed to a production company for the filming of a movie. If the contract of sale of the license to use the script stipulates that the production company will pay the author 10,000 euro, the production company will not, in fact, pay the author 10,000 euro. Rather, the production company will pay the author some lesser amount (in 2006, 9215.5 euro) and will pay the AGESSA the remainder (in 2007, 784.5).

A right- handed batsman, he made 17969 runs at 35.72 in his 355-game career which extended over 26 years. He became a Church of England clergyman. He was born in Oxford, and qualified by residence for Warwickshire County Cricket Club after moving to Coventry. He played for the county from 1910 to 1914 as a professional. He was commissioned into the British Army during the Great War, in which he won a Military Cross for gallantry. He continued in the Army afterwards, appearing for his county as an amateur in 1919 and 1923 as Capt. J. H. Parsons. In 1924, he resumed his professional career. In 1929, he was ordained, and from then until his retirement from the game in 1934 played again as an amateur. According to his obituary in Wisden, he might well have played for England but for the break in his career between 1914 and 1923. \\"A tall man, who made full use of his height, he was a superb driver of fast bowling, and one of the safest slips of his day.\\" In his final game for Warwickshire, against Yorkshire at Scarborough in 1934, under his captaincy, 216 runs were required to win in the fourth innings.

Combatants of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) Army were interned in Poland initially at the end of 1919 (after the breakdown of Ukrainian front) in ≈Åa≈Ñcut immediately after they organized six Rifle divisions. After the defeat of the UNR Army at the end of 1920 and its crossing over to Polish territory, about 20,000 soldiers were placed in a number of Internment camps, the most important were in ≈Åa≈Ñcut, Aleksandr√≥w Kujawski and Kalisz (Wadowice and Piotrk√≥w). In mid 1921, the internees were transferred from ≈Åa≈Ñcut to Strza≈Çkowo and at the end of 1921 from Aleksandr√≥w to Szczypiorno, as well as to neighbouring Kalisz. The internment camps remained until their final liquidation in the middle of 1924. The conditions of life in the camps of internees in Poland (in particular domestic and material) were difficult (considerably worse than in the internment camps for soldiers of Ukrainian Galician Army in Czechoslovakia). Despite this active cultural and educational life developed within the camps - courses for the illiterate and other (especially professional), various schools (there was a high school in Kalisz), folk university at ≈Åa≈Ñcut and Strza≈Çkowo; galleries, theatrical groups and other educational and cultural organizations - publications exposed artistic and also religious life (in particular in the press). The leader of camps of internees (it was in the Ukrainian hands and related to the UNR government in exile) cared about the theoretical military teaching and increased the petty officer personnel. The camps of internees in Kalisz and Szczypiorno were after Warsaw the second cell of life of Ukrainian emigration in Poland. The number of soldiers in internment camps diminished constantly: with departure to Czechoslovakia, in particular for university, to France for labour and similar.

It is used to warn others that they are being forced to do something against their will. Typically, the warning is given via some innocuous signal embedded in normal communication, such as a code-word or phrase spoken during conversation to alert other personnel. Alternatively, the signal may be incorporated into the authentication process itself, typically in the form of a panic password, distress password, or duress PIN that is distinct from the user's normal password or PIN. These concepts are related to a panic alarm and often achieve the same outcome. Civilian usage An alarm system with a keypad; entering the duress code and pressing OFF disarms the system normally but notifies police. Some home and property alarm systems have duress PINs, where the last two digits of the reset code are switched around. Entering the code when under duress from an assailant can trigger a silent alarm, alerting police or security personnel in a covert manner. The implementation of this feature has not been without controversy, as it has been claimed to lead to false alarms. A similar mechanism, SafetyPIN, has been proposed for use in ATMs. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report studying the viability of such mechanisms for ATMs.Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Economics Staff. Report On Emergency Technology For Use With ATMs, Pursuant to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. May 4, 2010 They noted duress PINs have never been actually implemented in any ATM, and conclude that the costs of deployment outweighs the likelihood they will actually deter criminal activity. When a duress PIN is used to trigger a silent alarm, an adversary can always request the PIN in advance and ensure the appropriately modified PIN is entered instead. If the adversary does not know which PIN is correct, they may choose randomly between the two possible codes allowing them to succeed half of the time.J. Clark and U. Hengartner. Panic Passwords: Authenticating under duress . USENIX Hot Topics in Security (HotSec) 2008 In scenarios where a panic password is used to limit access control, instead of triggering an alarm, it is insufficient to have a single panic password. If the adversary knows the system, a common assumption, then he will simply force the user to authenticate twice using different passwords and gain access on at least one of the two attempts. More complex panic password schemes have been proposed to address this problem.http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1866895 For cases where verbal communication (e.g. via cell phone) is possible with family member or friend, a covert phrase can be used to signal duress. In the slim chance that a captor allows the person in duress to use their cell phone (e.g. to obtain a PIN), there is a limited opportunity to use a duress code. Because conversations are often being monitored by a captor, they must be subtle and short. Ideally, the use of a duress code has been confirmed before the current situation, so the family member or friend has verifiable evidence that something is wrong, and when the authorities are notified aren't just limited to speculation. Examples would include asking about someone (or something) who does not exist. For example, a person might use \\"What is Cindy barking at?\\" if she knows that either the dog has a different name or that there is no dog. Another example, which is also an widely shared urban legend, would be a person calling 911 for help and pretending to order pizza delivery.http://www.snopes.com/crime/cops/911pizza.asp In addition to a duress code, there is duress activity. This may include the duressed individual withdrawing cash from an ATM using a specific credit card, instead of using their debit card. Many credit card companies allow for email alerts to be set up when specific activity occurs. There are technical issues that could pose problems, such as a delay in notification, cellular network availability, and the fact that a location is not disclosed, only the activity. Civilian and commercial aircraft can use transponder code 7500 as a duress code to indicate hijacking. Airlines maintain a verbal hijack code, as well. Military usage A World War II duress code was used over the telephone by SOE agents in occupied Europe, and involved giving a coded answer when someone checked whether it was convenient to visit a safe-house. If it was genuinely safe to visit, the answer would be \\"No, I'm too busy.\\" However, if the safe-house had been compromised (e.g. the Nazis had captured it, forcing the occupants to answer the phone at gunpoint in order to lure in other members of the SOE network) the captured agent would say \\"Yes, come on over.\\" Having been warned that the safe-house had been compromised, the other agent would hang up the phone and immediately inform his team-members so that they could take appropriate action. Typically, this meant using escape and evasion procedures, before the captured agent was tortured by the Gestapo and forced to give incriminating information such as names and addresses. In a major Cold War incident in 1968, the US Navy ship USS Pueblo was attacked and captured by North Korean forces, and the crew was abused and tortured during the subsequent 11 months. During that period, the North Koreans used the US crew for propaganda purposes, but the crew signaled their duress situation by secretly giving them \\"the finger\\" in staged photos. Admiral Jeremiah Denton became famous for blinking out the word \\"TORTURE\\" in Morse code during a propaganda television broadcast when he was captured by North Vietnamese forces.

A right- handed batsman, he made 18,533 runs at 29.79 in his 362-game career. Born in Queensbury, West Yorkshire, Horner was a neat, dapper batsman, who formed a powerful opening partnership with Fred Gardner, and scored a thousand runs in every season up to 1964. M.J.K. Smith commented that \\"Norman would have run Fred's legs off him if he had been allowed\\". He went down the order in 1958, when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) asked Warwickshire to promote Smith to develop him for a possible England opening spot. Horner scored quickly, and enjoyed his best three seasons from 1959 to 1961. On a flat Oval pitch in 1960 he scored a career-best 203 not out, and put on 377 with Billy Ibadulla for the first wicket on the first day, then the highest unbroken opening partnership in cricket history. He was quick in the covers and took 131 catches. He retired in 1965 to concentrate on landscape gardening and his work as a cricket groundsman.

During the battle the Polish forces of General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek successfully held the river crossings in the town for two days against the Nazi German Wehrmacht, which was enough time for the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade to cross the river and retreat further eastwards.  Before the battle  Contrary to most other Polish armies during the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the Krak√≥w Army managed to withstand the initial German assault on Silesia and retreat steadily eastwards. The Carpathians in the south and the Vistula river to the north provided enough cover for the army to focus on delaying actions in the path of the advancing Germans. However, the German numerical and technical superiority meant that the Polish forces were too weak to counter-attack and the best choice for the army was to hold the lines of rivers and major towns on the path of the Polish retreat. One such line was to be prepared along the San River by General Wac≈Çaw Scaevola-Wieczorkiewicz, the pre-war commanding officer of the Przemy≈õl-based 10th Corps Area, one of the peacetime units in the Polish Army. The preparations started on 7 September. However, as most forces in the area were already mobilized and most march battalions were sent to the front, the defensive positions along the river banks were severely undermanned. The following day in the area between Przemy≈õl and Rozwad√≥w, the Polish commander had only 10 battalions of infantry, one battalion of engineers and 42 pieces of artillery at his disposal. The central area of the line around Jaros≈Çaw (between Radymno and Sieniawa was manned by four battalions of infantry and 20 guns under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Jan W√≥jcik of the 2nd Legions' Infantry Division. The forces were insufficient to guard the river line, and especially so because the summer of 1939 was uncommonly dry and the level of water in Polish rivers was very low, allowing the armoured forces to cross them by fording. At the same time, the German 4th Light Division under Major-General Alfred Ritter von Hubicki and the 2nd Panzer Division under Lieutenant-General Rudolf Veiel were approaching the town of Jaros≈Çaw from the north-west, aiming at crossing the river and cutting off the retreating Krak√≥w Army from the east. During the night of 10 September, the earlier unit moved from the area of Rzesz√≥w through Pruchnik and Zamiech√≥w to Radymno at the San River. In the early morning the Germans took the Polish defenders by surprise and crossed the river, unopposed.  Defence of Jaros≈Çaw  Around the same time Colonel Stanis≈Çaw Maczek arrived at Jaros≈Çaw. His unit, the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, was one of only two fully motorized Polish units and had been used by the commanding officer of the Krak√≥w Army as an armed firefighter, thrown into battle each time the Germans or Slovaks tried to outflank the - much slower - Polish army. This time his unit formed the rear guard of the army and was to provide cover for the units retreating. Maczek decided to station his brigade around Jaros≈Çaw and strengthen the Polish defences there. Around noon the two German divisions arrived near Jaros≈Çaw and the Polish front guards retreated to the other side of the river, leaving only a token infantry force under Colonel W√≥jcik at the bridgehead on the western banks. Maczek decided to hold the city for one day in order to provide a safe haven for the slower units following his brigade. After that his unit was to continue its pursuit of his army and organize another delaying action further eastwards, near Lw√≥w (modern Lviv, Ukraine). In the early afternoon the Germans started their assault on the city, but were repelled and forced to leave several damaged or destroyed tanks on the battlefield. The repeated assaults later that day were also unsuccessful. Overnight Colonel Maczek decided that his plan succeeded and further defence of the city could result in his unit being cut out from the rear by the Germans advancing from Radymno. Because of that he moved his unit further eastwards to the Oleszyce-Lubacz√≥w area. Lieutenant-Colonel W√≥jcik's forces were to hold the town for as long as possible, and then follow the motorized brigade. The Poles blew up the bridges and left only a token force in the city, while the majority of the men retreated under the cover of darkness. In the early morning of 11 September the Germans resumed their assault, this time with a heavy artillery barrage. However, since most of the Polish units were already miles away, the losses were negligible. Around noon the panzers rolled towards the Polish positions only to discover that the several infantry companies (an infantry battalion under Captain Matheis), until then guarding the Polish positions, were also withdrawn.

It was dissolved and demolished in 1538 following orders of King Henry VIII to destroy Catholic churches as well as the dissolution of monasteries and abbeys. History At the time Alfred the Great refounded the royal city of Winchester about 880, the Saxon cathedral and the royal palace stood at the heart of the city. As the city grew, land was purchased in the city in the last year of Alfred's reign, and work was begun on the New Minster, beside the Old Minster, under the direction of Edward the Elder; when it was sufficiently complete, about 903, it was consecrated and fully endowed, the abbot Grimbald (died 8 July 901), a learned monk of St Bertin at St Omer in Flanders, was instated and the body of Alfred was reinterred in the new structure. Several further members of the royal house were also interred in the New Minster. The gift in 1041 by Queen Emma, widow of Cnut, of the head of Saint Valentine was cherished as one of the most valuable possessions of the now-reformed Benedictine house. In 1109 Henry I ordered the New Minster to be removed to the suburb of Hyde Mead, to the north of the city walls, just outside the gate; when the new abbey church of Hyde was consecrated in 1110, the bodies of Alfred, his wife Ealhswith, and his son Edward the Elder were carried in state through Winchester to be interred once more before the high altar. Their royal presence made Hyde Abbey a popular pilgrimage destination. In 1141 the church suffered damage when Winchester was burned during The Anarchy between supporters of King Stephen and Matilda, and it had to be substantially rebuilt. Henceforward the abbey prospered and acquired considerable land in the area, until it was dissolved in 1539The deed of surrender was published in Copenhagen 1996 (see note below). by Henry VIII at the dissolution of the monasteries and the surviving monks pensioned. The buildings were rapidly disassembled for their building materials and anything else of value. Lucky survivors from the lost library are the cartulary (conserved in the British Library), the late-13th or early-14th century breviaryOne of only six surviving breviaries of English provenance, it was edited by J.B.L. Tolhurst and published as The Monastic Breviary of Hyde Abbey, Winchester (London: Henry Bradshaw Society), 6 vols. 1932-1942. and the Liber vitae, the book of the men and women this Benedictine community remembered in prayer.Simon Keynes, The Liber Vitae of the New Minster and Hyde Abbey, Winchester (Copenhagen) 1996, including facsimiles. Three years later, when the antiquary John Leland visited the site in 1542 the Abbey was already a thing of the past. \\"In this suburbe stoode the great abbay of Hyde‚Ä¶\\", he commented. \\"The bones of Alfredus, King of the West-Saxons, and of Edward his sunne and king, were translatid from Newanministre, and layid in a tumbe before the high altare at Hyde.\\"http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/Alfred.html For 250 years, from 1538 until 1788, the choir end of Hyde Abbey, where Alfred and his family members were buried, was gradually forgotten about. Other parts of the abbey precinct were developed, notably the southwest corner which became a grand house. The lower eastern area, adjacent to the stream, seems to have been largely turned over to rough grazing although there are indications that it was also heaped with mounds of rubble. In 1788 the land was taken over by the county authorities as the site of a small local prison. The convicts themselves were put to work digging the foundations and in doing so, they started to come across a number of subterranean graves from across the abbey site. One observer was the local Catholic priest Dr. Milner who wrote: > Miscreants couch amidst the ashes of our Alfreds and Edwards‚Ä¶..In digging > for the foundations of that mournful edifice [the bridewell] at almost every > stroke of the mattock or spade some ancient sepulchre was violated, the > venerable contents of which were treated with marked indignity, A great > number of stone coffins were dug up, with a variety of curious articles, > such as chalices, patens, rings, buckles, the leather of shoes and boots, > velvet and gold belonging to chasubles and other vestments as also the > crook, rims and joints of a beautiful crozier, double gilt.

Syracuse Post Standard. Sep. 21, 2006., is a sport, usually played indoors but also sometimes outdoors. Matball is a safe haven game (sometimes termed a bat-and-ball game, despite the lack of a bat) similar to kickball, but with the key difference that bases are larger, often gym mats (giving the names \\"matball\\" and \\"big base\\"), and multiple runners can be on each base.  Object  The object of Matball is similar to kickball in which there are two opposing teams, each trying to score by kicking the ball and then running the bases (represented by mats) successfully. The team with the most runs scored is the declared the winner.Wellington School. \\"Wellington Matball\\". Accessed March 17, 2007. defense, while green denotes offense.  Rules  Although rule details vary from site to site, and even from game to game, there are a few standard rules. The game is very similar to kickball, with one team kicking (sometimes called \\"batting\\" despite the lack of bats) and the other team fielding. The primary difference is that, rather than small bases intended for a single runner per base, large bases that can accommodate multiple runners are used, giving the game its names, \\"big base\\" or \\"matball\\" (when played indoors, in a gym, mats are often used for the bases). As a result of allowing multiple runners, usually unlimited, per base, there are usually no force-outs, although some variants limit the number of runners per base and allow force-outs. In some cases, a kicking team is retired after a set number of outs (often three or five), but in other cases outs are not counted, and play continues until all members of the kicking team have kicked, ensuring that everyone gets to participate. The number of innings varies, often changing even from game to game, to fit the game to an allotted time; when outs are not counted each inning is longer, and so fewer innings are played. As in kickball, a ball is put in play when the pitcher rolls it to home base and the kicker kicks it into the designated field of play. The kicker must then run to at least first base. In most cases, when a player steps off a mat, sometimes just with one foot, that player must continue to the next base, though an exception is often made for an incoming runner whose momentum carries them a step or two beyond the base. Outs occur when a pop-fly is caught, the ball beats the runner to first base on the initial kick, a runner is touched by the ball while not on base, or runners do not tag-up after a pop-fly is caught. Because there is no standard field of play, rules about fair and foul balls and home runs vary widely. Common variants include the following: * A ball kicked behind home plate is a foul. * A ball that hits the gym ceiling before travelling a certain distance forward is often a foul or an automatic out. * Gym doors in front of home plate (in the fielding area) are sometimes left open, and a ball travelling through the doors may continue to be live, forcing the fielding team to retrieve it, or such a ball may be designated a home run. * Hitting certain parts of the gym, such as balconies or upper levels, may be designated a home run. * Hitting certain elements of the gym, such as a scoreboard or basketball backboard, may be designated a home run. In some cases a basketball backboard is in play, and only balls passing through the basket result in home runs. * To avoid damage, hitting certain elements of the gym, such as a scoreboard, may be designated as an automatic out. Common variants include the following: * The pitcher may be a member of the kicking team rather than the fielding team, to ensure easy pitches to put the ball into play. * Scoring a run often requires passing home base and safely reaching first base, or even making two full base circuits. ** In such games, home base is often not a safe haven, and runners must tag home base and continue immediately to first base. ** When two full circuits are required, runners passing home base are often required to grab a flag or rag, to make it clear which base runners are on their first circuit and which are on their second. * Some schools use four bases in a square or rectangle, rather than the traditional softball diamond, with the kicker standing between the first and fourth bases. * Instead of a catch counting as an out, it is sometimes counted as a point against the kicking team's score, decreasing the score by however many pop-fly catches are made. * Instead of a home run, kicks to designated areas or beyond the field of play may result in one point for the kicking team and the advancement of all on-base runners to third base. * Forward kicks that fail to travel a certain distance may be designated foul, to eliminate the need for a catcher and remove the option of bunting. * Schools might also implement the rule of \\"No-catch outs\\", meaning a ball is not out if it's caught * Runners may be allowed to travel clockwise or counterclockwise. However, once a runner starts they must continue in the same direction. * Runners must reverse direction after touching home plate. Scoring requires a runner to touch all the bases going counterclockwise and then clockwise back to home base. * Obstacles may be placed in the base paths. * Runners might be required to complete a certain activity at each base, such as a specific exercise, before they can resume running. * As each kicker puts the ball in play, a second player also begins a base run. *You can bunt a kicked ball like in volleyball until a certain defensive player (sometimes called an all-star) catches it. If the ball happens to touch the ground, the ball is still live.

Noironte is an old seigneurie erected during the Middle Ages that saw the village developed around a castle. The village has always kept a rural character with agricultural activity still present in the early twenty-first century, mainly cattle breeding, polyculture and a cheese factory. Its landscape is also marked by the presence of ponds and forests that cover a large part of the communal territory. Since the end of World War II, however, the village is gradually becoming part of a process of peri- urbanisation because it is part of the urban area of Besan√ßon and since 2003 has joined Grand Besan√ßon M√©tropole urban community. Its inhabitants called Noirontais and Noirontaises were 383 according to the census figures of 2016. Geography The commune of Noironte is located in the Bourgogne-Franche- Comt√© region and in the north-western extremity of the departement of Doubs. It lies west of Besan√ßon, prefecture of the department and east of Dijon, the capital of the region. The shortest distance by road between the village center and the city center of Besan√ßon (Place du Huit-Septembre) is . It is at the limit of the lower valley of the Ognon River and the Jura Mountains area of Avants-Monts. It is part of the canton of Besan√ßon-2 and Grand Besan√ßon M√©tropole. It is also integrated in the urban area of Besan√ßon. The municipal territory is bordered by nine other municipalities. PopulationLandmarks Ch√¢teau de Noironte Saint-Martin church The Ch√¢teau de Noironte is a castle whose existence dates back to the fourteenth century and was completely rebuilt between 1786 and 1830 following a fire. It has undergone few transformations since. Located in the center of the village, within a large wooded park, it consists of a main building, old farm buildings, a dovecote and a pavilion that served as a sculpture workshop for Ren√© de Chateaubrun at the beginning of the 20th century. The main building itself is made up of two wings arranged in the shape of an L, the north wing comprising a square tower and the east wing being flanked by a round tower. By order of July 5, 1993, the rooms in the north wing and their decorations (dining room, library, billiard room, large white living room) were classified as monuments historiques. All the facades and roofs of the main building and outbuildings as well as several elements of the main building (grand staircase, fireplaces and alcoves) benefit from less protection, having simply been listed and not classified as monuments historiques by decree of June 17, 1992. The Saint- Martin church was built from 1855 to 1880 under the leadership of architect Martin Belliard, replacing the old chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It is a neo-Gothic building about thirty meters long by fifteen meters wide built at the eastern entrance to the village. The bell tower of the church of Noironte, with a height of 39 meters, presents an original architecture, quite far from the traditional Comtois bell tower in the region. It is a spire with a truncated octagonal pyramid shape, framed by four pinnacles and surmounted by a roof lantern and a cross. Among the church furnishings is a carved wooden pulpit from the 18th century classified since 1975 as a historic monument object, a tall twisted wooden column from the 17th or 18th century, and two wooden confessionals.

Course Santry River mouth from a Kavanagh painting, ca. 1895 The Santry River rises at an elevation of c. 80m, in the semi-rural areas of Harristown and Dubber in the part of County Dublin now administered by Fingal County Council, near the village of St. Margaret's and Dublin Airport. The lead branch can be found at the end of a small lane in the former Harristown Demesne, now cut off by new road development. The river then flows along to the south of Dublin Airport (from which some tributary streams enter it), near the new Dublin Bus Harristown depot. With the Dubber branch, it passes for most of its upper course out in the open, flowing through Sillogue Public Golf Course and then more of Ballymun; up to this point, the main channel is called Quinn's River. The river traverses Santry, where it forms a major feature of the Santry Demesne, with small lakes within what is now the public park. In Coolock, the river forms a central feature in the valley which cuts through the district, and features the a pond, sometimes Coolock Lake, and a small cascade, running past the Stardust Memorial Park, and through the grounds of Cadbury's Ireland, where there is an EPA monitoring station, and a tumulus on its banks. The Santry River then enters Raheny near the beginning of Tonlegee Road, flowing alongside the Edenmore lands, past St. Joseph's Hospital, through the village centre, alongside the grounds of Manor House School, and then, with two areas of culverting, at the beginning and end of the former Bettyglen Estate, reaches the sea, where its mouth forms part of the eastern \\"lagoon\\" behind North Bull Island, and the flow enters Sutton Creek. The lower stretch of the river is occasionally noted as \\"Raheny River.\\" Drainage link from Naniken River The dotted line on the above sketch is an artificial link made by Dublin Corporation between the Santry River and the Naniken River, to reduce the flow of the latter and to allow handling of any flooding in either watercourse. It runs at the western end of Kilmore West in Coolock. Nearby catchments In its upper reaches, the Santry drainage basin is bordered by that of the Wad River, which comes to the sea at the city end of Clontarf, and that of the Mayne River system, which concludes at Baldoyle Bay. Citywards, the Naniken basin lies closer to the city, while to the north and east two small streams drain parts of Edenmore and Raheny; these two watercourses are the Fox Stream, reaching the sea at the end of Fox's Lane, and the Blackbanks Stream, with its mouth where Howth Road and the James Larkin Road meet. Studies As part of the management of the river, the Santry river is one of the third tier rivers being numerically mapped within the Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Study, with floodplain hydraulics computed (the other rivers being the Carrickmines, Deansgrange or Kill of the Grange, Poddle, Camac, Finglas and Mayne, along with one of the two second tier waterways, the Tolka). Incidents The Santry river has been noted for pollution incidents over the years, with industrial effluent and building material the most common causes (some of the latter once caused the main pond by the Stardust Memorial to be drained and reformed). There is a motorbike in the river in Stardust Memorial Park.

He was the co-founder of The Move in October 1965 with Trevor Burton, after meeting David Bowie at Birmingham's Cedar Club, following a performance by Bowie's band Davy Jones and the Lower Third. The duo invited Roy Wood, then Carl Wayne and Bev Bevan to join and complete the classic Move line-up. Kefford has bipolar disorder. His departure from The Move came after a period of heavy gigging and experimentation with LSD, and a nervous breakdown following a package tour with The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Pink Floyd, which took the form of a panic attack. Wayne believed that the start of The Move's downfall was Kefford's departure, because it placed guitarist Trevor Burton into the vulnerable position of having to play more instruments, and the band could well have survived if they had recruited a keyboardist to replace Kefford. After leaving The Move in mid-1968, Kefford embarked on a solo album with record producer, Tony Visconti, at the Olympic and Trident Studios in London. Eight songs were recorded, including a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Save the Life of My Child\\", featuring Jimmy Page on guitar. However, Kefford suffered a breakdown during the project and walked out, with the album remaining unreleased until 2003 (as Ace The Face, Sanctuary Records). Kefford formed The Ace Kefford Stand in 1968, which included guitarist Dave Ball, bassist Denny Ball, and drummer Cozy Powell. Kefford's later life has been plagued by alcohol, drugs, suicide attempts and time spent in psychiatric facilities.

He was brought up in France. He lived and studied in Nice, Paris, Rome, Aix-en-Provence, Munich. He mainly lived and worked for over forty years in Milan. Biography He was the nephew of Anselmo Govi, a painter from Reggio Emilia, who painted the fresco of the dome of the Ariosto Theatre. He belonged to a local Northern Italian and French aristocratic family also known as Beneville in its French form or Benedelli - Benevellum as reported in historical texts. La famille Beneville - Benevelli originated in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region of France Bonneville, Haute- Savoie. Also known as B√¥navela in Arpitan and Beneville in Provence. In the Piedmont region the name is also recorded as Benevello or Benevel. The Beneville-Benevelli family is already acknowledged as Gallorum/Gauls - of French origins - in the Modena area since the 15th century. They owned different titles and styles: Patricians of Modena; Count palatine; Knights of the Order of the Golden Spur and of the Order of the Golden Militia; Counts in Provence. An English variant of the surname is known as Benewell or Benwell and Boneville. Benevelli never styled himself as N.H. but used to sign some of his works with a seal representing six mountains and a cross, an element of his family coat of arms. Giacomo Benevelli was a member of the Tiberina Academy, an ancient and prestigious institution founded in 1813 with the aim to promote Italian arts and letters; Antonio Canova and Marino Marini belonged to the same institution. Benevelli was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts by the Italian Government Presidency for his contributions to the arts. He was the cousin of Emidio Benevelli, the founder of Benevelli Transaxles. Since 1957 Benevelli exhibited in Italy and worldwide. His first US exhibition was in 1963 at the Felix Landau Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1964 he was invited to the 42nd Venice International Art Biennale with a group of sculptures. In 1966 he was appointed as Head of Sculpture at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. Between the late 1960s and the early 1970s he created a series of lamp-sculpture, the most famous is the Roto lamp (1970s) and Arabesque (late 1960s). In 2009 he started a collaboration with the worldwide design and furniture brand Natuzzi in the newly created Natuzzi Open Art, a space dedicated to the collaboration between art and design. Benevelli created a new line of art-objects which first premiered at the Cologne Trade Fair (imm Cologne Furniture and Design fair), Salone del Mobile (Milan International Design Fair) and at the AD Home Show in New York (2010). In 1993 he realized a bronze sculpture called \\"Teleios\\", which can be seen in Piazzale Loreto in Milan. In 2000 the city of Mantua organized a major exhibition of his works in the museum of the historical Casa del Mantegna. A book was published by Edizioni Casa del Mantegna on this occasion. In 2001, he exhibited his works in the historical Palazzo Isimbardi during an exhibition organized by the city of Milan. During the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino he was invited to take part at the Italian Sculpture Exhibition at the Palazzina di Stupinigi. He realised a number of sacred art works for contemporary and ancient churches, and his works are preserved in numerous public and private collections in Italy and worldwide including at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp and at The British Museum in London.British Museum Catalogues Bibliography *Dalla Pietra all‚ÄôAgo, Rizzoli, 1983 *Tre scultori di Milano, Kenjir≈ç Azuma, Giacomo Benevelli, Giancarlo Marchese, 196? *Azuma, Benevelli, Marchese: Galleria Mosaico, Chiasso, La Galleria, 1966 *Benevelli: sculture e disegni : Castello di Sartirana (Pavia), [2 giugno - 9 settembre 1990] Ed. \\"Centro Studi\\", 1990 *Sculture contemporanee nello spazio urbano: Kengiro Azuma, Iginio Balderi, Giacomo Benevelli, Gianfranco Pardi, Gi√≤ Pomodoro, Carlo Ramous, Mauro Staccioli.

Popelin worked with Isabelle Gatti de Gamond in the development of women's education and, in 1888, became the first Belgian woman to receive a doctorate in law. After her accession to the bar was refused, Popelin went on to have an active career as the leader of Belgian League for Women's Rights. She died in 1913 without ever gaining admission to the bar.  Biography  Marie Popelin was born in Schaerbeek near Brussels into a middle-class family on 16 September 1846. One of her brothers was a doctor, another an army officer‚ÄîMarie Popelin was well educated by the standards of the time and place. Along with her sister Louise, she taught in Brussels at an institution run by the leading feminist teacher Isabelle Gatti de Gamond from 1864 to 1875. Disagreements with Gatti led to the sisters moving to Mons to run a new school for girls there, established with Liberal assistance. In 1882, Marie Popelin returned to Brussels to head the middle school in nearby Laeken, but was removed from her post the following year.  The \\"Popelin Affair\\"  At the age of 37, Popelin enrolled at the Free University of Brussels, studying law. Completing her studies as a Doctor of Laws in 1888, Popelin was the first woman to do so in Belgium. She applied for admission to the bar association (barreau) which would allow her to plead cases in the Belgian courts. Her application was refused, although no law or regulation explicitly prevented the admission of women to the bar. Her appeals to the court of appeal in December 1888 and, in November 1889, to the Court of Cassation were unsuccessful, but widely reported in the Belgian and foreign press. The \\"Popelin affair\\" (Affaire Popelin) demonstrated to the supporters of female education that simply providing young women with access to higher education was insufficient unless further, legal, changes were also made. The affair contributed to the transition from an educational feminism to a political women's movement in Belgium. Jeanne Chauvin, who obtained a law degree in Paris in 1890, was at first discouraged by the case, but was persuaded by the Belgian lawyer Louis Franck, a long-time supporter of Popelin, to apply for admission to the bar, and was sworn in after the French law was changed in 1900. In Belgium, women were only permitted to practice as lawyers from 1922.  Political activities  Marie Popelin participated in two feminist conferences in Paris in 1889, and established the Belgian League for the Rights of Women (Ligue belge du droit des femmes) in 1892 with the assistance of Isala Van Diest and L√©onie La Fontaine. Popelin was a friend of American feminist May Wright Sewall, who she had met in Paris in 1889, and with Sewall's encouragement, the Belgian section of the International Council of Women was established from 1893. Popelin's efforts to create an independent feminist movement outside the political pillars, not linked to the Catholic, Liberal, or Socialist parties, were only a partial success. The National Council of Belgian Women (Conseil national des femmes belges), created in 1905, received only limited support from the women's sections of the political parties. In spite of this tepid initial reception, many of Popelin objectives were met before her death in 1913. These legislative reforms did not, however, include two of Popelin's most important demands: universal adult suffrage, and equal access to the liberal professions for women. Modern studies acknowledge Marie Popelin's central role in the creation of a Belgian feminist movement.  Commemoration  Popelin has been commemorated in numerous ways within Belgium. She featured on a Belgian postage stamp during the International Women's Year of 1975, and a road in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode was named after her in 2008. In 2011 Popelin, together with the first Belgian female doctor, Van Diest, were depicted on the Belgian two euro commemorative coin for the 1st centenary of the International Woman's Day. In De Grootste Belg, a 2005 Flemish television poll to find the greatest Belgian of all time, Marie Popelin was ranked 42nd.

Life and career Robert Andrzej Krauthammer was born in Warsaw in 1935. He had shown musical talent from an early age, and his mother, an amateur pianist, was teaching him the piano when he was four years old. His family was Jewish; when the Second World War broke out, they were moved into the Warsaw Ghetto. Krauthammer remained here until 1942, when he was smuggled out and provided with forged identity papers that renamed him Andrzej Czajkowski; he then went into hiding with his grandmother, Celina. The pair remained hidden until 1944, when they were caught up in the Warsaw Uprising, and they were then sent to Pruszk√≥w transit camp as ordinary Polish citizens, from which they were released in 1945. Tchaikowsky's father, Karl Krauthammer, also survived the war, and remarried, producing a daughter, Katherine Krauthammer-Vogt; Tchaikowsky's mother, Felicja Krauthammer (n√©e Rappaport) was rounded up in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942, and died in Treblinka. Andrzej Czajkowski, as he then was named (he later adopted the spelling Andr√© Tchaikowsky), resumed his lessons at age 9 in Lodz State School, under the tuition of Emma Altberg (herself once a student of Wanda Landowska); from here, he proceeded to Paris, where Lazare L√©vy took over his education, and where he would also break off relations with his father for many years after an argument. After his return to Poland (1950), he studied at the State Music Academy in Sopot under Prof. Olga Iliwicka-DƒÖbrowska, and later at the State Music Academy in Warszawa under Prof. Stanis≈Çaw Szpinalski. Already during his studies he began developing his concert career, displaying his showmanship through public performances of Bach's Goldberg Variations, Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 and providing listeners with improvisations on any given theme. From 1951, he took composition classes with Prof. Kazimierz Sikorski. After his success at the fifth International Chopin Piano Competition, where he won the 8th award (1955), Tchaikowsky left to study in Brussels under Polish pianist Stefan Askenase. As a result of his co-operation with Askenase, Tchaikowsky took part in the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition, winning third prize in 1956. That same year, he emigrated to England, where he would reside until his death. In 1957, he gave a series of recitals in Paris, performing all of Ravel's compositions for piano in honor of the twentieth anniversary of the French composer's death. During the same time, he consulted Nadia Boulanger at Fontainbleau in matters of composition, as well as establishing contact with Arthur Rubinstein. Despite his success as a pianist, Andr√© Tchaikowsky‚Äôs greatest passion was composition. He wrote two Piano Concertos, a String Quartet, a setting of Shakespeare's Seven Sonnets for voice with piano, a Piano Trio and several compositions for piano solo. He completed an opera, The Merchant of Venice, based on Shakespeare's play. Most of the opera was written by 1978, and following discussions with the music critic Hans Keller, Tchaikowsky decided to submit it for consideration to English National Opera, then under the directorship of Lord Harewood. A playthrough of the first two acts was arranged in December 1981, with Harewood and the ENO artistic director David Pountney and conductor Mark Elder in attendance.Belina-Johnson (2013), pp. 386‚Äì387. But in March 1982 Tchaikowsky received a letter from Harewood turning the opera down.Belina-Johnson (2013), p. 346. By this time Tchaikowsky was already seriously ill, and he died only three months later. His dying wish was that the opera be performed.Belina- Johnson (2013), p. 389. The opera was not produced until 2013 at the Bregenz Festival. For RCA Victor and Columbia EMI, Tchaikowsky recorded works by Bach (Goldberg Variations), Haydn (two Sonatas, Variations in F minor), Mozart (Concerto in C major, two Sonatas and minor works), Schubert (waltzes, l√§ndlers, German dances), Chopin (15 mazurkas) as well as Faur√© (Piano Quartet in C minor). He made several recordings of his own works for the EMI label. Skull In accordance with Tchaikowsky's wishes, his skull has been used as a theatrical prop by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Here, actor David Tennant uses Tchaikowsky's skull in a 2008 production of Hamlet. Tchaikowsky died of colon cancer at the age of 46 in Oxford. In his will he left his body to medical research, and donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company, asking that it be used as a prop on stage. Tchaikowsky hoped that his skull would be used for the skull of Yorick in productions of Hamlet. For many years, no actor or director felt comfortable using a real skull in performances, although it was occasionally used in rehearsals. In 2008, the skull was finally held by David Tennant in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. After the use of Tchaikowsky's skull was revealed in the press, this production of Hamlet moved to the West End and the RSC announced that they would no longer use Tchaikowsky's skull (a spokesman said that it would be \\"too distracting for the audience\\"). However, this was a deception; in fact, the skull was used throughout the production's West End run, and in a subsequent television adaptation broadcast on BBC2. Director Gregory Doran said, \\"Andr√© Tchaikowsky's skull was a very important part of our production of Hamlet, and despite all the hype about him, he meant a great deal to the company.\\"  Notable compositions  * Piano Concerto No. 1 (1957) * Sonata for piano (1958) * Sonata for clarinet and piano, Op. 1 (1959) * Inventions for piano, Op. 2 (1961‚Äì1962) * String Quartet No. 1 in A major, Op.3 (1969‚Äì1970) * Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 4 (1966‚Äì1971) * String Quartet No. 2 in C major, Op. 5 (1973‚Äì1975) * Opera, The Merchant of Venice (1968‚Äì1982)  References Bibliography * David A Ferr√©: \\"Andr√© Tchaikovsky\\", Music and Musicians (December 1985) * Belina-Johnson, Anastasia (ed.)

Virgilio Tosi, 2006  Early life  On June 10, 1940, the day Italy entered World War II, Tosi started working as apprentice invoice-clerk at the Milan seat of a German firm dealing in steel products, while pursuing his studies in his spare time.  Early career  At the end of 1942 Tosi was noticed at an international youth meeting on theatre, and offered a position in the newly instituted Italian Theatrical Institute (Ente Teatrale Italiano), which had been created to run theatres and theatrical companies and was established in Rome. Meanwhile, he had engaged himself not to drop out of his studies, and passed his final secondary school exams in classical studies as an external student in 1943, in adventurous circumstances owing to Italy‚Äôs division in the war. At the end of World War II, having left the Italian Theatrical Institute, Tosi started working as theatre and cinema critic while studying philosophy at university. In 1946 he was among the promoters of the Theatre Association ‚ÄúIl Diogene‚Äù, where he worked as executive secretary; other members of the managing board were Mario Apollonio, Paolo Grassi and Giorgio Strehler. The following year, he participated in the creation of the Piccolo Teatro della Citt√† di Milano. The town‚Äôs City Council designated him, along with Grassi, Strehler and Apollonio, as member of the first managing committee of the theatre, responsible for the technical and artistic management. Tosi became increasingly interested in cinema. He was a founding member of the Cineteca Italiana in Milan and participated in the Filmclubs movement of the period; in 1947, he was among the promoters of the founding of the Italian Film Societies Federation (Federazione Italiana dei Circoli del Cinema), where he occupied executive positions between 1949 and 1952. Meanwhile, he started working as scriptwriter for fiction films, his professional apprenticeship in this area greatly increased by the cooperation with Cesare Zavattini.  Mature career  Tosi started directing documentaries and subsequently decided to pursue this activity, specialising in scientific documentary, continuing to work as cinema critic and essay-writer all the while. In the 1960s, he started cooperating with RAI, the Italian national public television network, for a number of television programmes. Among his activities, he has worked as consultant for UNESCO, the Istituto Luce, Rome‚Äôs National Gallery of Modern Arts, was president of the International Scientific Film Association and of the Italian Scientific Film Association, and research director in the field of audiovisuals for the National Research Council (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche), the National Film School (Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia) and RAI. He has pursued and is still pursuing historical research on the scientific origins of cinematography, and has realised experimental research to study the perception of the language of moving images through the recording of eye movements.  Later career  From 1976 Tosi has taught at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia and held seminars and conferences in many universities and film schools in Italy and abroad (United Kingdom, France, Mexico and other European and Latin-American countries). Since 1988 he has also taught at the Documentary School ‚ÄúZelig‚Äù in Bolzano. His main teaching subjects are ‚ÄúHistory and Critic of Documentary Film‚Äù and ‚ÄúScientific Documentary Techniques‚Äù. Between 2002 and 2004 he taught, as a temporary professor, the course of Documentary Film at Rome University ‚ÄúLa Sapienza‚Äù. Since 2012 he writes \\"La rubrica di Virgilio\\" for the Italian documentary portal \\"ildocumentario.it\\" .

Fed on a steady diet of popular culture, both Western and Chinese, the characters of Unknown Pleasures represent a new breed in the People's Republic of China, one detached from reality through the screen of media and the internet. The film was a co-production of four countries: Japan's Office Kitano and T-Mark, China's Hu Tong Communications, France's Lumen Films, and South Korea's E-Pictures. It competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival but would eventually lose to director Roman Polanski's Holocaust film, The Pianist. Unknown Pleasures is Jia's third feature film after 1997's Xiao Wu and 2000s Platform, and it is sometimes considered the final film of an informal trilogy on a modern China in transition.Berry, Michael (2002). \\"Jia Zhangke: Capturing a Transforming Reality\\" in Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers. Columbia University Press, p. 182-83. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-09-07. The film also marked Jia's last production outside of the Chinese studio system. With 2004's The World, Jia would work with the approval of the state film bureaucrats (SARFT).  Plot  Unknown Pleasures follows three disaffected, aimless young people in the industrial city of Datong in China's Shanxi province throughout 2001. Nineteen-year-old Bin Bin (Zhao Weiwei) lives with his mother, an adherent of the Falun Gong, in a small apartment near Datong's textile mill. Bin Bin's best friend, the reckless Xiao Ji (Wu Qiong), lives in an even smaller apartment with his father, and spends his time riding his motorbike around the city. The two friends eventually meet Qiao Qiao, a young singer and dancer working for the Mongolian King Liquor company as a spokesmodel. Xiao Ji immediately becomes enamored with Qiao Qiao, which gets him in trouble with Qiao Qiao's boyfriend, the loan shark and local thug, Qiao San (Li Zhubin). For much of the early parts of the film, the three characters seem to follow an aimless lifestyle. Unemployed, Bin Bin meets with his girlfriend to watch television on most days, while Xiao Ji seems to do nothing at all aside from flirt with Qiao Qiao. When an explosion rocks part of the city's textile mill, the characters are briefly pushed into action. Qiao Qiao, desperate to get her injured father into the hospital, has Xiao Ji rush to the bank in order to withdraw ¬•2000 for the entry fee. As thanks, she takes Xiao Ji and Bin Bin first to lunch, where Xiao Ji references watching Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and then to a discotheque. While dancing, Xiao Ji is led away by Qiao San's men, who humiliate and beat him. Enraged, Xiao Ji tries to avenge himself but is stopped by Bin Bin, who tells him that Qiao San keeps a gun on his person. Undeterred, Xiao Ji continues to pursue Qiao Qiao, who is eventually abandoned by her boyfriend. When the two young people end up in a hotel room, Qiao Qiao tries to explain to Xiao Ji the philosophy of Zhuangzi who, in his poem Ren Xiao Yao, \\"philosophized that we should do what feels good.\\" Soon afterward, it is learned that Qiao San has died in a car accident. The film implies that Qiao Qiao nevertheless leaves Xiao Ji and is last seen wearing a blue wig as a prostitute in a run-down club. Bin Bin, meanwhile, following the advice of his mother, tries to join the PLA, but is rejected when it is discovered that he suffers from hepatitis. Shattered, he borrows ¬•1500 from a small-time crook Xiao Wu (Wang Hongwei). Bin Bin uses the money to purchase a cell phone for his girlfriend, but when she tries to get close to him, he refuses, and notes only that there is no future for him anymore. Bin Bin and Xiao Ji decide to rob a bank, as they have seen so often in American films. Attaching a fake bomb to Bin Bin's chest, Xiao Ji drives Bin Bin to a China Construction Bank, where the latter is immediately arrested. Fleeing, Xiao Ji drives his motorbike down the highway until it breaks down and he hitches a ride to locations unknown. Bin Bin is left at the police station, where an officer informs him that robbery is a capital crime. The film ends as the police officer forces Bin Bin to stand and sing. Bin Bin chooses to sing Ren Xiao Yao, a pop song about being spiritually free through love.  Production  The idea for Unknown Pleasures first came from Jia Zhangke's short film, In Public, his entry in a documentary competition sponsored by the 2001 Jeonju International Film Festival held in South Korea. The competition (which also drew entries from Tsai Ming-liang and John Akomfrah) required that the shorts be filmed entirely in digital video. While Jia had originally intended only to film the derelict factories in Datong, the filming with digital video would soon inspire the director to begin production of Unknown Pleasures. As Jia stated at a news conference: \\"At first it was the bleak and lonely buildings that attracted me. When I saw the streets filled with lonely, directionless people, I became interested in them.\\" Unknown Pleasures was filmed using digital video in only nineteen days, as a result of time and budgetary constraints. In his production notes, Jia claims that the use of digital video produced a slight color discrepancy that lent itself to the tone he wanted the film to take. Additionally, the use of digital cameras meant a more streamlined production and greater ease of movement. As a result, Jia was able to begin shooting a mere three weeks after developing the idea for the film. According to Jia, the final scene of Xiao Ji riding down the highway as a thunderstorm approaches would not have been possible had traditional film cameras been used. But because of the flexibility of digital video, Jia Zhangke was able to capture the scene with the storm and in the director's words, creates a moment where the \\"environment is complementing [Xiao Ji's] internal feelings.\\"Berry, p. 199-200. At the same time, use of digital video restricted Jia. He noted in an interview shortly after the release of the film that he and cinematographer Yu Lik-wai were forced to cut back on exterior scenes due to the drawbacks of filming on digital video in sunlight.Berry, p. 200.  Creative team  The cast and crew of the film consisted of a mix of Jia regulars and newcomers. Cinematographer Yu Lik-wai, who has served in the role in nearly the entire Jia filmography, returns once again for Unknown Pleasures. Editor Chow Keung is also a frequent Jia collaborator and would help produce several of his subsequent films, including 24 City, The World, and the Golden Lion-winning Still Life. Along with producer Li Kit Ming, Chow and Yu have been described by Jia as the \\"core of his creative team.\\"Berry, p. 186-87. Among the cast, Zhao Tao (Qiao Qiao) and Wang Hongwei (Xiao Wu) are also Jia regulars.  Cast  * Zhao Weiwei as Bin Bin. A young man most often seen wearing an oversized dress shirt, Bin Bin is frustrated by his life in Datong. His relationship with his girlfriend is distant but tender, while his relationship with his mother is strained. Despite his seeming timidity, it is Bin Bin who eventually carries out the poorly thought through plan to rob a bank. * Wu Qiong as Xiao Ji. The long- haired Xiao Ji is Bin Bin's best friend. Considerably more reckless than Bin Bin, Xiao Ji's infatuation with Qiao Qiao drives much of the film's narrative. * Zhao Tao as Qiao Qiao. Jia Zhangke's frequent collaborator (she also appears in Jia's Platform, The World, Still Life, and 24 City) plays the female lead of Qiao Qiao. Slightly older than both Bin Bin and Xiao Ji (the film states that she is born in 1980 making her 21 years old), Qiao Qiao serves as the singing and dancing enticement for the Mongolian King Liquor company. It is Qiao Qiao that explains the philosophy of \\"ren xiao yao,\\" a form of hedonism. Jia wrote the character of Qiao Qiao to reflect the modern Chinese woman, who struggle between conservative tradition and modernity. According to Jia, Qiao Qiao is unable to continue her relationship with Qiao San because she cannot reconcile her hidden conservatism with the idea of becoming a mistress. * Li Zhubin as Qiao San, Qiao Qiao's older boyfriend, former gym teacher, and current \\"agent.\\" Unknown Pleasure's closest thing to a true villain, Qiao San is essentially a local thug in Datong. Though he is rarely physically violent himself, he carries a gun with him and has several of his cronies restrain and humiliate Xiao Ji at a dance club. * Wang Hongwei as Xiao Wu. A small-time crook, Xiao Wu appears in the very beginning of the film attempting to hustle a few RMB out of the two male protagonists. Shortly thereafter he is arrested and taken away for unknown reasons. Xiao Wu shows up again later in the film to provide a loan to Bin Bin. The character of Xiao Wu, as played by Wang Hongwei, is presumably the same character from Jia Zhangke's debut film, Xiao Wu. In one of the film's more lighthearted moments, Xiao Wu asks Bin Bin if he has Xiao Wu, Platform or Love Will Tear Us Apart (directed by cinematographer Yu Lik-wai) DVDs. According to the director, this self-reference was possible in part because Xiao Wu (and Wang Hongwei) had become a cultural icon in China's independent film scene.Berry, p. 197. * Zhou Qingfeng as Yuan Yuan, Bin Bin's studious girlfriend. Throughout the course of the film, Yuan Yuan has dreams of getting into a Beijing university in order to study international trade. Yuan Yuan's character was consciously set apart from the main three characters, in that she is the only character with set goals for life and the possibility to escape provincial life. * Bai Ru as Bin Bin's mother, a proponent of the Falun Gong. * Liu Xi'an as Xiao Ji's father, an uneducated man who mistakes a single US dollar to be a fortune. * Jia Zhangke plays a small role in his own film as the opera-singing man seen throughout Unknown Pleasures.  Themes =The \\"Birth Control\\" generation  In his production notes, Jia has stated that the portrayals of youth by Wu Qiong, Zhao Weiwei, Zhao Tao was meant to illustrate the \\"birth control\\" generation, or the generation to emerge from China's One-child policy. With no brothers or sisters, Jia wanted to show these individuals as isolate, alone, \\"confronted with an existential crisis of individuality.\\" In a separate interview, Jia noted that unlike his own generation, this generation is often detached from reality, filtering their experiences through the internet, television, and other media.Berry, p. 193. In one oft-referenced scene, Xiao Ji discusses the film Pulp Fiction to Qiao Qiao, after which Jia quickly cuts to the two dancing in a club with music sampled out of that film. Critics and scholars also picked up on this existentialist strain in the characters of Unknown Pleasure. Elvis Mitchell, for example, wrote, \\"[t]he saddest thing about it is that the social ineptitude of the Pleasure youth doesn't even belong to them -- they've sampled it from Western culture, just like the clangorous funk of the dance club music. They want to soak up someone else's dream.\\" Similarly, Kevin Lee of Senses of Cinema writes how \\"the attitudes of these kids are almost completely derived by the electronic mass media that they consume and that consumes them.\\" As J. Hoberman notes in his review, for Xiao Ji, Bin Bin, and Qiao Qiao, Unknown Pleasures are those that \\"are everywhere in evidence, yet satisfaction itself is beyond reach.\\" Each of the three main characters therefore try to achieve a state of \\"Ren Xiao Yao\\" - freedom from all constraints. This phrase and concept arises multiple times in the film. As described by Qiao Qiao, it is part of the philosophy of the Taoist Zhuangzi. She refers to the belief that life is the pursuit of absolute freedom and pleasure. Jia writes, however that In another reference, \\"Ren Xiao Yao\\" is the name of a pop song from 2001, and is the song that Bin Bin sings in the film's ironic final scene in a jail cell. Freedom, it seems, is harder than it looks. In a running theme, Bin Bin and Xiao Ji consistently refer to the Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Bin Bin explicitly draws the point that unlike himself, the Monkey King has no parents and no burdens. For Jia, the story of the Monkey King \\"reflects the fatalism of [Unknown Pleasures]\\" in that unlike the Monkey King, these characters \\"struggle desperately. They pull themselves out of difficult situations, but they always fall back into new problems because no one can escape the rules of the game. True freedom doesn‚Äôt exist in this world.\\"  2001  Jia's production notes also reveal the importance of the film's time period: 2001. At numerous instances in the film, newscasts and other media link the characters to external current events. These include the Hainan Island incident with the United States, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, a sabotage in a factory in Datong itself, and China's successful bid to become the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics. For Jia, the year 2001 was particularly significant:  Datong and Beijing  The film's setting carried its own significance. Like in Xiao Wu, Unknown Pleasures takes place in a run down industry town in China's Shanxi province. Whereas the earlier film ended with the destruction of a city block, in Unknown Pleasures, the entire city of Datong seems to be in a state of disrepair and ruin. Jia noted in an interview that in one sense, Datong was \\"truly a city in ruins, and the people that inhabit it very much live in a spiritual world that reflects their environment.\\" In contrast to Datong, the film paints Beijing as a dream world. Bin Bin's girlfriend, the only character with real ambitions and goals, is trying to get to Beijing in order to attend university. Meanwhile, when Beijing is selected as the host city for the 2008 Olympics, a crowd of people gathered around a television burst into cheers. Towards the end of the film, a newscast states that the Datong-Beijing Highway is soon to be completed, hinting that escape and progress are not far behind. For Jia, however, the depiction of the provincial town only highlights \\"the gap between rich and poor\\" and the gap between the image of cities like Shanghai and Beijing as depicted on television, and the lives of those who live in cities like Datong. For these characters, Beijing is the \\"Moscow of Three Sisters-- dreamland as a receding horizon.\\"  Reception  Unknown Pleasures was relatively well received by western critics but with qualifications. Upon its premiere at the New York Film Festival, then New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell commented on the film, noting that even if \\"the world doesn't need another picture on disaffected youth...Unknown Pleasures is about more than alienation.\\" Stylistically, however, Mitchell felt that Jia's long-takes and slow pans started to feel repetitive, a sort of \\"reductive neo- realism.\\" The Village Voice's J. Hoberman gave the film a much stronger review than many of his contemporaries, arguing that Unknown Pleasures was \\"Jia's most concentrated evocation of contemporary China's spiritual malaise.\\" The film was not universally praised, however, and many critics found significant flaws in the film's style and pacing. One common complaint was that like the film's aimless protagonists, Unknown Pleasures seemed lost in its own narrative. One critic argues that the film's story \\"goes nowhere\\" and as a result the audience never \\"understand[s] the motivation of the characters.\\" The industry magazine Variety also gave the film only a middling review, with a similar complaint that the film \\"is far more diluted thematically, touching on a number of interesting points but failing to bring them together in any cohesive way.\\" Two internet review aggregates reflect the film's somewhat average impression among western critics; coincidentally, both Metacritic (ten reviews) and Rotten Tomatoes (twenty-eight reviews) give Unknown Pleasures scores of \\"61\\" (out of 100), or \\"Generally favorable reviews\\" and \\"fresh,\\" respectively.See external links.

He was born in Savign√©-l'√âv√™que (Sarthe region, France). After studying law in Paris, Lavall√©e became the director of various companies such as the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans. He also became a businessman in the region of Nantes, working for ten years with his brother-in-law who was a shipowner of the merchant vessel Bourgault Ducoudray. After moving to Paris in 1827 where he moved with his wife and his one-year-old daughter, Amazilli, Lavall√©e became a shareholder of the Le Globe, a liberal opposition newspaper with Saint-Simonian roots. Two years later, Lavall√©e decides to create a new school of engineering for the emerging industrial sector in France, at a time where all the leading institutions were essentially training engineers for public administration. He founded in 1829 the prominent √âcole centrale des arts et manufactures in Paris, also known as the √âcole Centrale Paris, with the help of three scientists: the chemist Jean- Baptiste Dumas, the physicist Jean Claude Eug√®ne P√©clet and the mathematician Th√©odore Olivier. Lavall√©e provided most of the funds with his private capital to establish the school and became its first president (directeur). The first location of the school was the H√¥tel de Juign√© building in the Marais district, which has now become the Mus√©e Picasso. His son, Pierre Alphonse Martin Lavall√©e (1836‚Äì1884), created an arboretum in the park of the Ch√¢teau de Segrez in Saint-Sulpice-de-Favi√®res (Essonne), which was one of the biggest in Europe at the time.

Wells was born at Yallum Station near Penola, South Australia and grew up in the Mount Gambier, South Australia district, and after a short stint in a merchants office, joined the South Australian Survey Department in October 1878. In 1883 the surveyor General, G.W. Goyder, offered him the Assistant Surveyor position to the Northern Territory and Queensland Border Survey Expedition, under Augustus Poeppel. This task took almost three years to complete, the honours of driving in the last peg being shared with assistant John Carruthers. and Wells spent the next couple of years working in the far north of S.A. and the N.T., surveying pastoral boundaries. In 1891 he was appointed surveyor to the Elder Scientific Exploration Expedition, under David Lindsay. Lindsay's instructions were to investigate the remaining \\"blanks on the map\\" of Australia, (essentially the Great Victoria, Little Sandy, Great Sandy, Tanami, and the Simpson Deserts. After a good start, the expedition suffered hardship and psychological problems, which saw Lindsay returning to Adelaide to explain the situation, leaving Wells in charge of the remnants of the expedition. It was disbanded in March 1892, after Wells had discovered evidence of gold at what became Wiluna. Only Wells and the cook, Warren, came away with a \\"clean slate\\". Returning to the Survey Department, Wells married Alice Marion Woods (14 Feb 1870 ‚Äì ) on 22 September 1892. Alice was a daughter of noted Adelaide architect E.J. Woods. In 1896 Albert Calvert, a London mining engineer, proposed through his Adelaide Agent, A.T. Magarey, to finance an expedition to complete the task of the Elder Expedition, again supervised by the South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia. Wells was selected to lead the Calvert Exploring Expedition of seven men and twenty camels, which left Lake Way, near present-day Wiluna, on 16 July 1896, and headed northeast into uncharted country. After a substantial reconnaissance trip, October found the party just over halfway through the two Sandy Deserts, when it was decided that Wells's older cousin Charles Wells (2IC) and George Jones, (the 18y.o. nephew of David Lindsay) would make a 'flying trip' to the west, and then rendezvous with the main party at Warburton's Joanna Spring, some 300 km further north. The increasing heat of the advancing summer, lack of feed for the camels, and scant water, caused both parties incredible hardship - the main party was soon only travelling at night, and were forced to abandon virtually everything at Adverse Well, and the remainder the following day. Low on water and unable to locate Joanna Spring, innocently mismapped by Warburton, they made a desperate dash for the Fitzroy River. Charles Wells and Jones abandoned the flying trip, and following the main party by about twelve days, perished. Their sun dried bodies were finally found on 27 May 1897, 26 km south west of Joanna Spring, after five search expeditions by Larry Wells. From August 1897, Wells transferred to the Pastoral Board, but from March to September 1903 led the Government North-West Prospecting Expedition. Returning to the Surveyor General's Office, Wells spent three years till September 1908 on a trigonometrical survey in the north west of the N.T. In 1909 Wells joined the State Taxation Department, and the following year became the Federal Deputy Commissioner of Land Tax for S.A., rejoining the Land Board as chairman in 1918, until his retirement in 1930. Again pulling on his explorers boots, he led the (private) Quest (1930), Endeavour (1932) and Tarcoola (1933) Expeditions. Wells was dubbed by J. M. Maughan \\"the Last Australian Explorer\\", and though not the only one so called, he did stand out as one who treated Aboriginals with an unprecedented level of humanity. In 1935 Wells received the Jubilee Medal, and in 1937 the O.B.E. Wells died after being struck by a rail car near Blackwood Railway Station on 11 May 1938, and was buried at the Mitcham Cemetery.

The company is most famous for its very high quality sounding cassette decks. Nakamichi's Life Etsuro Nakamichi founded Nakamichi Research in 1948. The brother of Niro Nakamichi, he was an acoustic engineering officer in the Japanese Navy doing sonar research. After the war, he started Nakamichi Research by researching in electromagnetism, magnetic recording, acoustics and communications. The company he founded initially designed and developed portable radios, tone arms, speakers and communications equipment. With the development of magnetic tape in 1951, Nakamichi felt his company could develop and refine the technology of recording heads. Within a few years his company developed an open-reel tape recorder, and in 1957 the Japanese public was introduced to an open reel recorder under the FIDELA brand name. The company he founded subsequently went on to develop some of the world's best cassette decks, including the world's first 3-head cassette deck. At one point in the mid 1960s the company manufactured tape decks for a number of foreign companies including Ampex, Harman Kardon and Motorola. His company was also the first to license Dolby-B Noise Reduction from Dolby Laboratories in 1969 as well as High Com and High-Com II from Telefunken in 1977.

The school is a member of the G20 Schools Group. The Daly College now also has a Business School under its umbrella ‚Äì the Daly College Business School (DCBS), in collaboration with the De Montfort University, Leicester, UK. DCBS offers an undergraduate course in business management- Bachelor in Management (Business Studies) (BMBS). Old Campus of The Daly College, Indore History HH Maharaja Sir Jayaji Rao Scindia of Gwalior State, General Sir Henry Daly (Founder of The Daly College), with British officers and Maratha nobility in Indore, Holkar State, ca 1879. The school has its origins in the Residency School, founded by Sir Henry Daly Governor General of India's Agent to Central India Agency in 1870, as a school for the children of nobility and aristocrats in the Indore Residency. It was later renamed as the East Rajkumar College in 1876, and in 1882 the school received its present name, The Daly College, after its founder. The school was visited by Lord Northbrook (1st Earl of Northbrook) Viceroy and Governor-General of India in 1875, thereafter it was renamed \\"Indore Residency College\\" in 1876. In 1882 the Chiefs named the school \\"The Daly College\\" to honour the contribution of Sir Henry Daly. The foundation stone of the new building was laid on 14 November 1885 by Lord Dufferin (1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava) Viceroy and Governor-General of India, as a memorial in the honour of Sir Henry Daly. In 1891 the two Maratha Maharajas, Sir Shivaji Rao Holkar of Indore (Hokar State) and Sir Madho Rao Scindia of Gwalior donated the two student houses, 'Gwalior House' and 'Indore House'. In 1898 the \\"Rajkumar School\\", which had opened at Nowgaon near Chhatarpur (Bundelkhand) in 1872, was amalgamated with the Daly College. Later Lt. Gen. H.H. Maharajadhiraja Sir Madho Rao Scindia, Maharaja of Gwalior unveiled a bust in the honour of Sir Henry Daly in the main building of the school. The Scindia Pavilion, Circa 1910s In 1905, Sir Henry's son, Sir Hugh Daly, was appointed agent to the Governor-General for Central India at Indore, to the position previously occupied by his father. He took great interest in the Daly College and made it flourish it as a Chief's College. H.H. Maharajadhiraja Sir Tukojirao Holkar III, Maharaja of Indore (Hokar State) then donated of land east of the old campus and rulers contributed to build on the newly acquired land. Construction started in 1906 on two student houses, a temple, a mosque and the Principal's residence. The main building was constructed with marble from the Udaipur quarries and was designed in the Indo-Saracenic architecture by Col. Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob. The clock tower was donated by H.H Maharaja Sir Sayaji Rao III Gaekwad of Baroda. The main building was officially inaugurated on 8 November 1912 by H.E. Lord Hardinge (1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst) Viceroy and Governor-General of India, after which the old campus was given up. For the next 28 years the college was open exclusively to the sons of the Princes and Chiefs of Central India as well as the rest in the Indian Empire. In 1940 the Board of Governors decided to prepare students for a modern and free India. The Daly College came together with a few other institutions and started the Indian Public Schools Conference. Its doors were thrown open to admissions on merit, regardless of caste or creed. Recently, the school added an 1100+ seat auditorium to its infrastructure. The school became coeducational residential in 1997, and in 2005 it became a member of the Round Square. It was proclaimed the second best school in India in 2013. The school won the prestigious \\"Kasliwal Trophy\\" for a record 20 times (1992‚Äì2012).

According to the town's Jews, the number of fatalities was between 165 and 200. These acts were committed before Romania entered World War II, before it became Germany's ally, and before the German military entered the country. For details of the Pogrom itself, see volume I, p.363-400. Although the Romanian government had taken steps against Jews, including antisemitic laws, and seizure of Jewish property, these military actions against the Jews were not endorsed by the government; when the conspiracy against the Jews was discovered by the military command, troops were sent to put an end to the abuse. The perpetrators, however, were not punished. Background The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact (August 1939) gave the Soviet Union a green light to take back Bessarabia in June 1940 (see June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum, and Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina). During the Romanian Army's withdrawal from Bessarabia, some of the local residents demonstrated their joy. Attacks on the soldiers by locals are also documented. Various reports speak of attacks on the retreating soldiers by Jews, though their veracity is disputed, and some have been proven to be fabrications. Additionally, although the reports defined all of them as \\"Jews\\", among the celebrators and attackers were Ukrainians, Russians, pro-Communists, newly released criminals, and ethnic Romanians. These reports, regardless of veracity, did much to incite many Romanians against Jews, strengthening existing Anti-Semitic sentiment. The Romanian people were traumatized and frustrated by giving up these areas without a war, and the regime's position weakened significantly. The government scapegoated the Jews, with the press' support: > Confronted with an extremely serious crisis and doubting their regime could > survive, Romanian government officials turned the Jews into a political > \\"lightning rod,\\" channeling popular discontent toward the minority. Notable > in this report is the reaction of the Romanian press, whose rage was > directed more toward Jews than the Soviets, the real aggressors. Given that > the Romanian press was censored in 1940, the government must have played a > role in this bias. A typical form of anticipatory scapegoating was to let > Jewish leaders know that the Romanian authorities might launch acts of > repression against the Jews. The incited Romanians, and especially the Romanian soldiers, looked for ways to take revenge on the Jews. In 1930, the population of Dorohoi was 15,866, of which 5,788 were Jews. Although local Jews had long suffered from Antisemitism, it was greatly increased by the passing of Romanian refugees, who were spreading tales of Jews' scheming against the Romanians. Preparations for the pogrom On 30 June 1940, soldiers from the two brigades stationed in the area went from door to door warning the Romanian residents of the \\"revenge\\" about to take place against the Jews. The Christians placed religious icons in their windows, drew crosses on their homes, or raised Romanian national flags, to let the rioters know not to harm them. In the town, the rumor spread that harming the Jews would be allowed for 24 hours. The pogrom In an incident between Romanian and Soviet military men in Her≈£a, neighboring Dorohoi, the Soviets killed a Romanian officer, and a Jewish-Romanian soldier, Iancu Solomon, who was trying to defend the officer. The two were laid to rest in separate funerals. A firing squad was sent to Solomon's funeral, made up of 10 Jewish soldiers from the battalions stationed nearby. Some local Jews also participated in the funeral. Right after the coffin was lowered into the grave, many shots were heard, and the local Jews ran and hid in the local cleansing room. The Jewish soldiers, turning to the cemetery gates, were surrounded by soldiers from the 3rd Border Patrol battalion, commanded by a Colonel. The Jews, peering from the cleansing room, saw the Jewish soldiers disarmed and stripped of their uniforms. They were put up against the cemetery's back wall and shot by the Romanian soldiers. Seven were killed instantly, and three injured. The Romanians placed a submachine gun in the hands of the already dead Emil Bercovici, the senior Jewish soldier, to stage the notion that he had started firing on the Romanians. An especially strong downpour begun, stopping the killing for a while, and allowing some of the Jewish crowd to slip away. Many Romanian soldiers, commanded by a Lieutenant, removed the Jews from the cleansing room using violence and threats. They were led to a ditch outside the cemetery. Two old men and one child managed to escape before the shooting began. The soldiers continued hunting the Jews hiding in the cemetery with the help of the place's Romanian keeper. Concurrently, soldiers led by officers and sergeant majors burst into the town shouting \\"the Bolsheviks are coming\\". The soldiers raped, robbed, tortured and murdered Jews for 24 hours. The lives of many were saved due to the great attention the soldiers gave to the robberies. Many acts of cruelty were committed, among them: * Avraham Calmanovici was shot after his testicles were cut off. * An old couple named Elli and Feiga Reizel were murdered after their ears were cut off. * Rivka Croitoru had her breasts amputated. * Hershko Croitoru had petrol poured on his beard, which was then lit up. The life of the local Jewish community, Axler, was saved after he managed to prove to the soldiers stopping his carriage that he had been discharged from the Romanian military with the rank of Colonel, and was awarded two medals of valor. Jews walking in the streets were stopped by officers, had their papers checked, and when their Jewish identity was confirmed, murdered. At this point, the local 29th infantry brigade, who were not privy to the murder plot, stepped in. The brigade sent a company to patrol the town and restore order. After local Romanians shouted at the soldiers and told them that Jews were firing at soldiers, Lieutenant Vasile IsƒÉceanu took \\"precautionary measures\\" - he ordered ten Jewish soldiers, disarmed of their weapons, to march in front of the unit. Soon the unit's soldiers joined the persecution of the Jews, arresting them under false charges of firing at soldiers. The battalion's vice commander, Stino, prevented the soldiers from executing the detained Jews, and saved from certain death 20 Jewish soldiers, who were already stripped bare, waiting to be executed. A downpour stopped the killings, but not the looting. Some local Roma (Gypsies) joined this activity, stole as much as they could from Jewish homes and thanked the soldiers with song and dance. The pogrom was stopped by order of General Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu, who discovered the events by accident, seeing injured Jews. He ordered Colonel Ilasievici to investigate the matter. The \\"cover up\\" On 2 July, the day after the pogrom, the Romanian military's Chief of Staff reported that the 3rd brigade \\"took revenge\\" on the Jews because of the difficulties they had had with the Jews of Bessarabia. According to his report, the soldiers killed four Jews, injured 15, and plundered several shops. The military prosecutor of the 8th Corps headed a committee to investigate the events, with the participation of doctors and the town's representatives. On 3 July, the military prosecutor found 50 unidentified corpses, among them 11 women, five children and six non-local Jewish soldiers. The prosecutor did not determine the identity of the murderers, and only determined that the deaths were the results of gunshot wounds. The bodies were buried quickly by a company of troops, due to the advanced stage of decomposition they were in. Officially, it was determined that 53 Jews were murdered, but the Jews claimed, according to the community's records, that the number of victims was between 165 and 200. The bodies in the ditch outside the cemetery were not exhumed from their mass grave, and were not counted. The local head of police, Gheorghe Pamfil, composed a report about a \\"skirmish event\\", resulting in the death of a few Jews. The officers of the 3rd brigade were transferred to other positions, and the brigade left the town with its carriages filled with loot. Among the pillaged goods were cans of paint, which were not properly sealed, and the convoy's trail was marked with paint stolen from the Jews.

As with the other contributions to the album, it was recorded on 4 September 1995 and released five days later. It coincided with the screening of Drummond and Cauty's film about the K Foundation's burning of one-million British pounds, and the duo fielded questions from audiences relating the subjects. The only song released by the duo under the One World Orchestra moniker, the song is a drum and bass-styled cover version of the theme music from The Magnificent Seven, with vocal contributions from the counter-culturist DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, who agreed to participate after Drummond and Cauty's original idea of Robbie Williams was unavailable. Despite the duo's dislike of \\"The Magnificent\\", it was used by B92 as a jingle and, in 1996, it became recognised as a protest song against the Serbian government of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Origins In late summer 1995, Tony Crean of Go! Discs Records spoke with Bill Drummond about the proposed Help Album, a not-for-profit charity LP for children affected by the Bosnian conflict. Although Drummond claimed that the duo \\"despised the whole idea of people in the entertainment world getting publicly involved with charity\\", he and his KLF musical partner Jimmy Cauty nonetheless agreed to participate. The turnaround time of the album's production, from its recording to its appearance in record shops, was a tight five-day schedule, with all recording to be complete by the end of the first day (4 September 1995).War Child International: Help Album Interactive Gallery. warchild.org - Retrieved: 13 March 2007. To produce the song, Drummond and Cauty re-assembled The KLF's regular production team: keyboardist Nick Coler, engineer Ian Richardson, and mixer Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent. Cauty had for some time been entertaining the notion of covering Elmer Bernstein's theme from The Magnificent Seven. According to Drummond, the duo envisaged crafting this alongside the vocals of Robbie Williams, recently sacked from the band Take That for his wayward behaviour in the presence of the paparazzi. Williams, however, was unavailable, holidaying in Turkey with his mother, and so due to the production deadline, this collaborative idea was abandoned. \\"Serbia calling\\": B92 DJ Fleka was central to the composition. An alternative vocal focus was found at short notice in Fleka (real name Miomir Grujiƒá), a Belgradian counter-culturist well-known in Serbia \\"for his involvement in a huge variety of art, music and media projects dating back to 1980 and the communist regime of Tito\\". In 1995, Fleka was a late-night DJ for the subversive independent Serbian radio station B92, where he was a vocal critic of the incumbent Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. At the request of Drummond and Cauty, the duo recorded some phrases spoken down a phone line by Fleka: \\"This is Radio B92: Serbia calling. Message follows\\", and \\"Humans against killing: that sounds like a junkie against dope\\". In return for the contribution, Drummond and Cauty agreed to visit Serbia and appear on Fleka's radio show. Fleka's words were incorporated into the track and, titled \\"The Magnificent\\", it was dispatched to Go! Discs, with Cauty and Drummond assuming the pseudonym 'One World Orchestra featuring the Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guard'. Although this was the first and only occasion on which the duo adopted the elaborate One World Orchestra name,Discogs.com, One World Orchestra discography. discogs.com - Retrieved: on 13 March 2007.However, the \\"Children of the Revolution\\" were a name associated with some earlier hits by The KLF, referring to additional performers on those recordings. See, for instance, Sleevenotes, \\"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\\", KLF Communications KLF 005X, January 1991. Select magazine commented that \\"it was obvious to any close observer of pop\\" who was behind the composition. Members of The Help Album production team planned for the One World Orchestra track to open the album, but this idea was vetoed by executive producer and War Child patron Brian Eno, who considered the song \\"too political\\" for that role; instead, \\"The Magnificent\\" was placed as track 15 of the album. Charity and money- burning On 5 September 1995, as the K Foundation, Cauty and Drummond presented the first British screening of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. Fielding questions from an audience oblivious to the duo's recent studio endeavours, they were asked whether they would make any more music, to which Drummond scoffed, \\"What do you expect us to do, go and make a jungle record?\\", and Cauty: \\"Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. It would just be sad wouldn't it? We're too old.\\" When interviewed after the event by BBC Radio 1's Steve Lamacq, \\"The Magnificent\\" was aired, and the K Foundation revealed that they were going to screen Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid in Belgrade's Republic Square the following week, motivated, according to Drummond, \\"to ask [the audience] if its a crime against humanity\\". The film was shown as planned, powered by a hot dog kiosk and projected on to \\"a pair of double-sized white bed sheets\\" held up with drawing pins, in the absence of a suitable screen. An audience member told the duo: According to Drummond, members of the audience applauded when Cauty obligingly burned a banknote of hyper-inflated Serbian currency. During their stay in Belgrade the duo were guests for the duration of Fleka's three-hour late-night B92 show. Fleka aired \\"K Cera Cera\\", in comparison to which, Drummond felt, \\"[\\"The Magnificent\\"] sounded pathetic. We had let the [Bosnian] children down\\". Nevertheless, the One World Orchestra song was donated to B92 for use as a jingle. At a subsequent screening of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid for Bradford anarchists, Drummond and Cauty were challenged to reconcile their contribution to a charity record with their burning of a million pounds. Cauty's response was that \\"The Magnificent\\" \\"was a mistake; we should never have done that.\\" Drummond agreed, elaborating: Irrespective of the duo's regrets, \\"The Magnificent\\" was, by 1996, not just a jingle of B92 but the station's signature tune. From this use, the song ultimately became recognised as a protest anthem of Serbia's discontented anti-Milo≈°eviƒá resistance.Horan, T., \\"Belgrade's Battle Station\\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2001 (link). Recalling events in his book 45, Drummond mused that \\"a track we recorded in a day, never released as a single, thought was crap and had forgotten about has taken on a meaning, an importance in a 'far off land' for a struggle I hardly understand.\\" Composition \\"The Magnificent\\" is a short composition, in keeping with the requirements of The Help Album 's producers. According to the album's originator, Tony Crean, \\"We had trouble fitting all the tracks on‚ÄîI had to tell the artists not to make their tracks longer than 3 minutes 45. ... [W]hen Bill Drummond told me The KLF (One World Orchestra) track was only two minutes, it was a cert.\\" The track is a cover version of The Magnificent Seven theme. Its tempo approximates that of the original tune, but whereas the original is percussively sparse, One World Orchestra's drum-oriented cover has a tempo in excess of 160 beats per minute, which is typical of drum 'n' bass tracks. \\"The Magnificent\\" features no sung vocals, but uses sampled speech throughout, in the form of Fleka's contributions and, punctuating the track at points, a male voice announcing \\"The Magnificent!\\" ‚Äì this vocal sample was taken from the introduction of the 1971 release \\"Double Barrel\\" by Dave and Ansil Collins. Recurring prominently are sounds of machine-gun, six shooter and artillery fire, a theme used regularly in The KLF's late singles (most overtly \\"What Time Is Love? (Live at Trancentral)\\", \\"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\\" and a B-side, \\"America No More\\"). Police car sirens, used in the duo's \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" and \\"Build a Fire\\", also feature here. Both the gunfire and the sirens are fitted to rhythmically accentuate the fast tempo. The song begins with Fleka's \\"This is Radio B92: Serbia calling\\", and launches into The Magnificent Seven melody on horn and string sounds, against a backdrop of gunfire that blends into fast drum machine patterns. During the two breaks, Fleka's \\"Humans against killing: that sounds like a junkie against dope\\" is backed first by the melody played on soft flutes, and second by a sequence of climactic string chords not present on the original theme. The speaker's separation from the listener is conveyed by the thick static interference that accompanies his words over the phone line. Fleka's sentiment‚Äîthat humankind cannot control its urge to kill‚Äîoffers insight into his perspective as a citizen within Milo≈°eviƒá's regime. Reception Select magazine called \\"The Magnificent\\" a \\"comic-epic cover\\". The Scotsman retrospectively extolled One World Orchestra's \\"wilfully provocative\\" offering as the \\"best of all\\" contributions to \\"one of the best compilations of the 1990s\\".Eaton, A., \\"Not Just a Charity Case\\", The Scotsman (S2), Edinburgh, 4 October 2002. In 2002, the Glasgow Herald contrasted the career of Drummond with that of One World Orchestra's desired collaborator Robbie Williams: \\"In the shadow of EMI's multi-million pound marriage to Williams [reportedly worth the then unprecedented sum of ¬£80m], Drummond's seemingly esoteric projects make complete sense and ooze relevance\\".Williamson, K., \\"The Pirates Have Won the War\\", Glasgow Herald, 7 October 2002.

Club career Born in Pamplona, L√≥pez Vallejo began his career at hometown's CA Osasuna, making his first appearance for the main squad not yet 19 in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Sporting de Gij√≥n on 15 May 1994, although the Navarrese had already been relegated from La Liga. He became an undisputed starter from the 1995‚Äì96 season onwards. Vallejo signed for Villarreal CF in 1999 alongside teammate Jes√∫s Unanua (also a goalkeeper), appearing in all the games during the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign as the club returned to the top flight after a one-year absence. He retained first-choice status the following two years. With the signing of Pepe Reina in 2002 and the subsequent arrival of imports Sebasti√°n Viera and Mariano Barbosa, however, L√≥pez Vallejo was consecutively demoted to backup and third-choice. In order to search more playing opportunities he joined fellow league team Recreativo de Huelva on loan for the 2006‚Äì07 season, where he played the majority of the Andalusians' matches in that competition. In 2007‚Äì08, Vallejo signed for Real Zaragoza on a free transfer, where he backed up former Real Madrid player C√©sar (two games played). As the latter moved to Tottenham Hotspur in August 2008 he became the starter, with the side now playing in the second division, and was instrumental as they immediately returned to the top level. L√≥pez Vallejo started the 2009‚Äì10 season on the bench, then became first-choice over Juan Pablo Carrizo.

The type was designed to carry daylight bombing missions, without the protection of escort fighters. Consequently, while its official name, Army Type 100 Heavy Bomber, was accurate in regard to its formidable defensive armament and armor, these features also restricted the Ki 49 to payloads comparable to those of lighter medium bombers ‚Äì the initial production variant could carry only 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of bombs. A mid-wing, cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, the Ki-49 was one of the first Japanese aircraft fitted with a retractable tailwheel. During World War II, it was known to the Allies by the reporting name \\"Helen\\". Development The Ki-49 was designed to replace the Mitsubishi Ki-21 (\\"Sally\\"), which entered service with the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in 1938. Learning from service trials of the Ki-21, the Army realized that however advanced it may have been at the time of its introduction, its new Mitsubishi bomber would in due course be unable to operate without fighter escorts. The Japanese Army stipulated that its replacement should have the speed and defensive weaponry to enable it to operate independently. The prototype first flew in August 1939 and the development programme continued through three prototypes and seven pre-production aircraft. This first prototype was powered by a pair of 708 kW (950 hp) Nakajima Ha-5 KA-I radial engines but the next two had the 932 kW (1,250 hp) Nakajima Ha-41 engines that were intended for the production version. Seven more prototypes were built and these completed the test programme for the aircraft. Eventually in March 1941, the Donryu went into production as the Army Type 100 Heavy Bomber Model 1. Operational history Wrecked Ki-49 on Papua New Guinea Going operational from autumn 1941, the Ki-49 first saw service in China. After the outbreak of the Pacific War it was also active in the New Guinea area and in raids on Australia. Like the prototype, these early versions were armed with five 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine guns and one 20 mm cannon. Combat experience in China and New Guinea showed the Donryu to be underpowered, with bomb capacity and speed suffering as a result. Thus, in the spring of 1942 an up-engined version was produced, fitted with more powerful Ha-109 engines and this became the production Army Type 100 Heavy Bomber Model 2 or Ki-49-IIa. The Model 2 also introduced improved armor and self-sealing fuel tanks and was followed by the Ki-49-IIb in which 12.7mm (0.5 in) Ho-103 machine guns replaced three of the 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Type 89 machine guns. Ki-49 in flight over Japan, 1945 In spite of these improvements, losses continued to mount as the quantity and quality of fighter opposition rose. An attempt was made to stop the rot in early 1943 by further up-engining the type. This petered out owing to development difficulties with the 1,805 kW (2,420 hp) Nakajima Ha-117 engines and the Ki-49-III never entered production with only six prototypes being built. In the face of its increasing vulnerability to opposing fighter aircraft while performing its intended role, the Ki-49 was used in other roles towards the end of the Pacific War, including ASW patrol, troop transport and as a kamikaze. After 819 aircraft had been completed, production ended in December 1944.

Biography Lundeberg left his home in Oslo, Norway at age 14, joined the Seamen's Union of Australia in 1917 and transferred into the Sailors' Union of the Pacific in Seattle in 1923. He sailed for 21 years on sailing ships and steamers of a variety of flags, eventually earning American citizenship. In 1934, Lundeberg was sailing as third mate aboard the SS James W. Griffiths. In the course of the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike, Lundeberg walked off his ship in Oakland in support of the strike. At its height, at least 8,000 west coast sailors joined the strike. On July 30, 1934, as the strike came close to conclusion, Lundeberg was elected Sailor's Union of the Pacific patrolman for the Seattle area. In April 1935 at a conference of maritime unions in Seattle, it was decided to establish an umbrella union to represent the membership of the International Seaman's Union as well as maritime officers and longshoremen. This umbrella organization was called the Maritime Federation and Lundeberg was named its first president. Later that year, he was elected Secretary-Treasurer of SUP. Over the next two years, the International Seamen's Union experienced intense difficulties, including the revocation of their charter and the loss of 30,000 seamen in July 1937 to the Congress of Industrial Organizations' newly formed National Maritime Union. A month later, William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, took over the ISU with the goal of rebuilding it under the AFL. Lundeberg, who was now also head of the Sailor's Union of the Pacific, oversaw this reorganization. On October 15, 1938 at an AFL convention in Houston, Texas, Green handed Lundeberg the Seafarer's International Union charter. The new union numbered some 7,000 members on the east and gulf coasts. Lundeberg served as president of SIU from 1938 until his death from a heart attack in a San Francisco hospital on January 28, 1957. Memorials This monument commemorates Harry Lundeberg, and his efforts in the S.U.P. strike *There is a memorial sculpture to Harry Lundeberg at 450 Harrison Street in San Francisco, California, outside the entrance to the Sailors Union of the Pacific Hall. The sculpture consists of a bust of Lundeberg, placed on a marble pedestal in front of the building. On the pedestal is a plaque which reads: Harry Lundeberg - 1901‚Äì1957 - He was indeed a man who crowded into a short life no glittering promise, but unselfish service and general achievement for the course he called his own.Bust of Harry Lundeberg (Smithsonian Art Inventory Sculptures) *In 1967, Paul Hall established the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship in Piney Point, Maryland to give young people the chance for a career at sea. Since then, thousands of SIU members have advanced their skills, and thousands of young people from deprived backgrounds have found employment through the school. There is a memorial to Hary Lundeberg outside the Seaman's Hotel at the Seafarers Harry Lundeburg School of Seamanship. Norwegian Cruise Line provides in-house STCW training in this facility for their new hires.

Kansas City Chiefs Pitts came to the Chiefs in 1965, the team's fourth-round draft pick. He had speed and desire, but throughout the wide receiver's first three seasons in Kansas City. he acquired a \\"bad hands\\" label. However, he worked through the problem, and when starting wide receiver Otis Taylor was injured in 1968, Pitts stepped in. He was a starter the next three seasons, and his end around reverse runs became a big part of the Chiefs' offense. Super Bowl IV Hank Stram told the play to Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson. \\"Listen, let's have a ... 9-0-8, 51 G-O reverse.\\" As Dawson ran back to the huddle, Stram told everyone on the sidelines, \\"Here comes the reverse from Tight I, it could be wide open.\\" Dawson took the snap, faked to Wendell Hayes on the left side of the line, then turned the ball to a sprinting Frank Pitts, who turned the corner and jetted down the right sideline for 20 yards. It was one of the biggest plays of the Chiefs' Super Bowl IV win over the Minnesota Vikings, and it set up Jan Stenerud's third field goal of the game. Pitts ran the reverse again in the third quarter and picked up a critical first down. Otis Taylor scored on the next play. In 74 games for Kansas City, Pitts caught 78 passes for 11 touchdowns and ran the ball 24 times for 238 yards and one touchdown. Cleveland and Oakland The Chiefs traded Pitts to the Cleveland Browns before the start of the 1971 season, where he became one of their starting wide receivers.

The above is an 1875 portrait of Marx. The critique of ideology is a concept used in critical theory, literary studies, and cultural studies. It is often used in literary and cultural studies where it focuses on analyzing the ideologies found in literary and audiovisual works (e.g. films and television series). These ideologies can be expressed more or less implicitly. The focus is on analyzing and demonstrating the underlying ideological sympathies of the texts and then criticizing the attitude of these works.

Early life  Nabi Bakhsh Baloch son of Ali Mohammad Khan Laghari Baloch, was born in the village of Jaffer Khan Laghari, District Sanghar of Sindh, Pakistan on 16 December 1917. He obtained his early education at Village Palio Khan Laghari from a local teacher. He then went on to acquire Secondary education from the famed Naushero Feroz Madressah . He completed Matriculation in 1936 and affiliated himself with Bahaudin Degree College, Junagarh, in 1941. Baloch then went on to Aligarh Muslim University. According to Baloch this was where he cultivated the acquaintance of Sub-Continent's intellectual elite whose inspiring influence equipped him to become the 'man of letters'. Baloch returned to Sindh and while teaching at Sindh Muslim College, Karachi (1945‚Äì46) as a professor of Arabic, he applied for scholarship to the U.S. for higher education. He left for the U.S. in 1946 and joined the 'Teachers College', Columbia University, New York, for his master's degree in education and later acquired a Ph.D. in the same discipline in the year 1949. After the completion of his thesis on Teacher's Education, he joined an internship program with United Nations. owing to his highly impressive work at U.N. he was offered a permanent post there, which he chose to decline and returned to Pakistan.  Career  In 1950, Baloch joined the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (Pakistan) (called Ministry of Information back then), as officer on special duty. Baloch set a trend in government publications as well as broadcasting on radio. He initiated the monthly magazine Naeen Zindagi. Numerous other publications about Pakistan and its five provinces were started by Dr. N.A. Baloch to educate the public and counter the propaganda from across the border. In addition, he promoted the folk music and folk culture of the five provinces through radio. In 1951, he was appointed as Public Relations Officer for Pakistan Mission in Damascus. However, he opted to participate in the making of the Sindh University, Hyderabad, Sindh and once again returned to homeland for a higher cause. He was the first professor appointed by the university where he established the first ever Department of Education in Pakistan. In 1973, Baloch was conferred with National Merit Award and was elevated to the position of Vice Chancellor of the University of Sindh(1973-1976). During his tenure at the university he was responsible for initiating several publications and editing monographs such as: Journal of Education, Journal of Research: Arts and Social Sciences, Historical Perspective on Education, Methods of Teaching Hasil-a-lNijh of Jafar al- Bubakani, and Report on Education in Sindh with an extensive introduction by Baloch (drawn by B.H. Ellis, first printed for the Government at the Bombay Education Society Press in 1856). Baloch also played a key role in the establishment of various institutes associated with the University of Sindh. Department of Sindhi began work in 1953. A Sindhi Academy initiated earlier by Baloch developed into the concept of the Institute of Sindhology. Baloch worked out the draft of the scheme to establish the institution at Sindh University, which was approved by the Secretary of Education. Baloch served as the Director and at his insistence, the name was changed from Academy to Institute. Baloch had the Institute shifted form Old Campus to the New Campus. the institute, now, has a large library, a museum, heritage gallery and an auditorium. It has been carrying out the work of collecting and preserving books and other materials on Sindh and publishing them. Baloch initiated the publication of the monthly journal of the Institute under the name Ilmee Aa'eeno (Mirror of Knowledge) Parallel to the continuing scholarly endeavours mentioned above, Baloch during his tenure at the Sindh University remained a guiding force for several institutes in Sindh. He worked as Honorary Secretary Bhitshah Cultural Centreweb.culture.gos.pk/index.php/component/.../48-bhitshah-culture-center where he organized literary conferences during the annual functions. He promoted the rural cultural milieu, spreading the message of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai. In this regard he published studies on Shah Jo Risalo. The first biographical work on Shah Abdul Latif written in Persian by Mir Abdul Hussain Khan Sangi, Lutaif-i-Lateefee, was edited and introduced by Baloch and published by Bhitshah Cultural Centre in 1967. The manuscripts of Shah Jo Risalo were procured from London and published in 1969.World of Work- Predicament of a Scholar, edited Prof Umar Chand,Institute of Sindhology,2007 Mehran Arts Council was established under the chairmanship of the commissioner of Hyderabad, Baloch as honorary secretary, worked out the scheme, persuaded authorities to give grants, bought a plot for the council in Latifabad and had a building constructed.

This work was translated into Bengali by Folk Music Research Group, Dacca, East Pakistan in 1970. Baloch also edited Aziz Baloch's work, ‚ÄòSpanish Cante Jundo and its Origin in Sindhi Music‚Äô, published by Mehran Arts council in 1968. Among other articles and monographs, Mehran Arts Council also published Sabhai Rangga (All Hues) on all aspects of folkloric poetry in 1969 edited and introduced by Baloch. Baloch was also instrumental in influencing decisions by the Archaeological Department and extended his cooperation in initiating excavations at Bhanbhore, Mansura, Umarkot, and Talpur Museum at Hyderabad Fort. He persuaded the Department of Archaeology to establish Zonal office of Archaeology at Hyderabad. The wall of the fort of Hyderabad near the main gate, Mosque of Mian Yarr Mohammad, Graveyards at Landhi and Mian Wahyoon, Tomb of Mir Shahdad Khan and number of other historical places were preserved at his behest. The landmark achievement in this regard was the establishment of a number of museums. Land was procured and buildings were constructed alongside the Raani Bagh on National Highway for the Sindh Provincial Museum and Sindh Provincial Library for which Baloch had been working since 1951.

Bain National Anthropological Archives Smithsonian Institution December 2002, Retrieved 7 July 2019 It was also during Baloch's term as the vice chancellor of Sindh University (1973 - 1976) that an International Conference ‚ÄòSindh Through the Centuries‚Äô was held from 2 to 7 March 1975 at Karachi, jointly hosted by Karachi and Sindh Universities. Baloch as one of the chief hosts took the delegates to visit the historical and archeological sites most of which had been discussed in the papers presented at the conference. Illustrious scholars from world over who participated in the conference included: H.T. Lambrick, J.E. van Lohuizen, J.A. Boyle, S.Digby, C.F. Buckingham, Annemarie Schimmel and E.I. Knez. From January 1976 to June 1989, Baloch's services were acquired by the Federal Government of Pakistan in Islamabad, on specific orders by the then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Baloch was given the designation of Secretary for Culture, Archaeology, Sports and Tourism, a post he served at for one year. Important projects supervised and guided by Baloch include the Centenary Celebrations of Quaid e Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah (1976) and Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1977). He also served as Member Federal Pay Commission and Member Federal Review Board. From 1 July 1979 and up to October 1979, Baloch was appointed chairman of the National Commission on Historical and Cultural Research. The institute was able to initiate several projects of significance under his chairmanship. The following research works were launched: *Publication of \\"Pakistan Journal of History and Culture\\" *Chachanama, critical edition with Persian text, English translation and extensive Introduction and notes *Advent of Islam in Indonesia *Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi‚Äôs Diary During His Days of Residence in Kabul, Afghanistan The following other projects were completed: *Pakistan: A comprehensive Bibliography of Books and Government Publications with Annotations 1947-80, Islamabad, 1981, pp. 515 edited by Baloch. *Two volumes of Documentations on Separation of Sindh from Bombay edited by Dr. Hamida Khuhro of which the first volume was published. *History of the Taxila Region A project in six volumes studying architectural monuments of *Pakistan *Thatta and MakliDr Nabi Bux Baloch remembered on his 100th birthday The Express Tribune (newspaper), Published 18 December 2017, Retrieved 8 July 2019 *Uch *Multan *Lahore and Wooden Architecture in Northern areas. Except Pakistan and the work on Lahore, the rest of the studies were completed and published during Baloch‚Äôs tenure. The work on Thatta and Makli was assigned to Dr. Ahmad Hassan Dani. Baloch would accompany Dr. Dani to Thatta and provide all possible help in this regard. He wrote a detailed introduction on the city of Thatta which was appended to the work. Baloch planned a project of 25 volumes of history of the Muslim Rule in the Subcontinent to be published by the institute. The first seven volumes of the project were to include original works on #Advent of Muslims in Sindh; Fatehnama (Persian Text, English Text, Arabic Text) #Arab Rule in Sindh (712-1050 AD), #Ghaznavi Period, #Ghaurid Sultans, and Delhi‚Äôs Sultans of Slave Dynasty, #Khalji Period, #Tughlaq Period, #Afghan Kings: Lodhi & Suri Periods. The next five volumes (8th to 12th) were designed to cover the Mughal Empire: (8) Babur & Humayun. (9) Akbar, (10) Jahangir & Shahjahan, (11) Aurangzeb, and (12) Decline of Moghuls. The next seven volumes (13th to 19th) were expected to cover ‚ÄòLocal Rulers‚Äô: (13) Sultans of Bengal, Jaunpur, Awadh; (14) Deccan and 18 Mysore; (15) Gujrat & Malvah; (16) Sindh; (17) Punjab & Sarhad; (18) Baluchistan; and (19) Kashmir. The 20th volume was to cover the British Period: Freedom Movements. The remaining five volumes (21st to 25th) were planned to cover various aspects of the ‚ÄòIslamic Heritage‚Äô: (21) Governmental Institutions (Establishment), (22) Education, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Mathematics, Navigation, (23) Communications, City Development, Agriculture, Industry & Technology, Trade & Commerce, (24) Art of Construction (Architect and Archeology) and related Arts & Skills, and (25) literature. In November 1980, Baloch was called upon to take charge as the first Vice Chancellor of the International Islamic University, Islamabad. The university became functional in shortest possible time under Baloch's punctilious and sanguine management. However, he resigned in August, 1982 and continued his work at the National Institute of Historical Research until October, 1982. From 1983 to 1989, Baloch served as adviser to ‚ÄòNational Hijra Council.‚Äô Here, Baloch began work on the ‚ÄòOne Hundred Great Books of Islamic Civilization‚Äô_ a project that was of high standing in its originality and literary value. In all, eleven works were published out of which five were produced under Baloch‚Äôs personal supervision. The work on remaining six was finalized, but published after he left the organization (1989) and returned to his hometown, Hyderabad. Books that were edited with introductions by Baloch under the Great Books Project are as follows: #Al Khawarazmi‚Äôs Algebra, original Arabic text with Rosen‚Äôs translation, introduction by Prof. Ayidin Sayili, and explanatory notes by Mullek Dous was published in 1989. #Banu Musa, Kitab al-Hiyal (The Book of Ingenious Mechanical Devices), translated, annotated, and introduced by Dr. Donald Hill. #Al-Jazari‚Äôs Kitabul Hiyal, (Integration between Theory and Practice in the Application of Mechanics), translated into English by Ahmad Y. al-Hassan and introduced by Donald Hill, 1989.

The work discusses al-Beruni‚Äôs experiment which for the first time introduced the concept of ‚ÄòSpecific Gravity‚Äô. # Hamidullah Khan, The Prophet Establishing A State, 1989. Baloch, in 1989, formally began the compiling, rearranging and editing of the authentic text of the Poetic Compendium of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai,Shah Jo Risalo. This was a gigantic project involving not only extensive research and deep rooted understanding of the great poet‚Äôs philosophy but also an optimum expertise in Sindhi Language itself. In this regard he also produced a companion dictionary Roshni for the understanding of the classical text. In 1991, Sindhi Language Authority was established by the Government of Sindh, and Baloch was invited to join as its chairman. Baloch remained with this institute for a period of 27 months during which numerous works were published on a multitude of topics pertaining the teaching and promotion of Sindhi Language. During his tenure at Sindhi Language Authority he was also given the additional charge of Minister for Education with the caretaker government for a period of three months. Baloch remained Professor Emeritus Allama I.I Kazi Chair, University of Sindh, established in 1990 until his demise.

History and profile The first issue of Tokyojin was published in January 1986. Until the June 2001 issue it was published by the Tokyo Metropolitan Foundation for History and Culture (, T≈çky≈ç-to Rekishi Bunka Zaidan).More strictly, until the October 1995 issue it was published by T≈çky≈ç-to Bunka Shink≈ç-kai (), which subsequently became the Tokyo Metropolitan Foundation for History and Culture; the change taking effect between the October and November 1995 issues. The non-profit, non-commercial backing meant that the magazine stayed independent of the preoccupation with shopping and other consumption shared by the huge majority of Japanese magazines, and Tokyojin could concentrate on substantive issues of urban design and so forth. From July 2001 the magazine was published by Toshi-Shuppan (), a commercial publisher; it has increasingly moved in the direction of a guide to culture, leisure and eating out in Tokyo for the middle-aged and retired, although it still has plenty of material of substance, and also of interest to other demographics. In early 2007, its advisory editors were Sabur≈ç Kawamoto, Hidenobu Jinnai, and Mayumi Mori. The March 2007 issue, as an example, is a special issue titled \\"Edo Yoshiwara\\", about the Yoshiwara entertainment area of Edo: of the total of 162 pages (rather few of which are devoted to advertising, either overt or, as is common in Japanese magazines, covert), seventy-six pages are devoted to Yoshiwara. The contributors include Sh≈çichi Ozawa and Makoto Takeuchi; features include a six-page interview with a very active and alert eighty-eight-year old geisha.

It was discovered more than 100 years ago. R. solani frequently exists as thread-like growth on plants or in culture, and is considered a soil-borne pathogen. R. solani is best known to cause various plant diseases such as collar rot, root rot, damping off, and wire stem. R. solani attacks its hosts when they are in their early stages of development, such as seeds and seedlings, which are typically found in the soil. The pathogen is known to cause serious plant losses by attacking primarily the roots and lower stems of plants. Although it has a wide range of hosts, its main targets are herbaceous plants. R. solani would be considered a basidiomycete fungus if the teleomorph stage were more abundant. The pathogen is not currently known to produce any asexual spores (conidia), though it is considered to have an asexual lifecycle. Occasionally, sexual spores (basidiospores) are produced on infected plants. The disease cycle of R. solani is important in management and control of the pathogen. History In 1858, Julius K√ºhn observed and described a fungus on diseased potato tubers and named it Rhizoctonia solani. Rhizooctonia is from Ancient Greek, ·ø•ŒØŒ∂Œ± (rhiza, \\"root\\") + Œ∫œÑœåŒΩŒøœÇ (ktonos, \\"murder\\"). Solanum, Latin for nightshade, is the genus of the potato. The disease caused was well known before the discovery and description of the fungus.[Parmeter, J. R. Rhizoctonia Solani, Biology and Pathology. London, UK: University of California, 1970. Print.], University of California Biology and Pathology.  Hosts and symptoms  R. solani causes a wide range of commercially significant plant diseases. It is one of the fungi responsible for brown patch (a turfgrass disease), damping off (e.g. in soybean seedlings), black scurf of potatoes,Rhizoctonia disease of potato http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Potato_Rhizoctonia.htm bare patch of cereals,Rhizoctonia root rot http://cbarc.aes.oregonstate.edu/rhizoctonia-root-rot-bare-patch root rot of sugar beet,Rhizoctonia diseases of sugar beet belly rot of cucumber,Rhizoctonia disease of cucumber http://cuke.hort.ncsu.edu/cucurbit/cuke/dshndbk/br.html sheath blight of rice,Rhizoctonia sheath blight http://www.lsuagcenter.com/NR/rdonlyres/C93A494B-8105-4804-9DFA-81190EC3F68B/58166/pub3123ShealthBlightofRiceHIGHRES.pdf and many other pathogenic conditions. The fungus, therefore, has a wide host range and strains of R. solani may differ in the hosts they are able to infect, the virulence of infection, selectivity for a given host ranges from nonpathogenic to highly virulent, the temperature at which infection occurs, the ability to develop in lower soil levels, the ability to form sclerotia, the growth rate, and survival in a certain area. These factors may not always show up given the environment and host that Rhizoctonia attacks.[Ogoshi, Akira. \\"ECOLOGY AND PATHOGENICITY OF ANASTOMOSIS AND INTRASPECIFIC GROUPS OF .. RHIZOCTONIA SOLANI KUHN.\\" Annual Review of Phytopathology 25.125-43 (1987)] R. solani causing crown rot infection on Beta vulgaris, common beet R. solani primarily attacks seeds of plants below the soil surface, but can also infect pods, roots, leaves, and stems. The most common symptom of Rhizoctonia is \\"damping off\\", or the failure of infected seeds to germinate. R. solani may invade the seed before it has germinated to cause this pre-emergent damping off, or it can kill very young seedlings soon after they emerge from the soil. Seeds that do germinate before being killed by the fungus have reddish-brown lesions and cankers on stems and roots. Various environmental conditions put the plant at higher risk of infection due to Rhizoctonia, the pathogen prefers warmer, wet climates for infection and growth. Postemergent damping off is a further delay in attack of R. solani. The seedling is most susceptible to disease in its early stages.[Cubeta, M. A., and R. Vilgalys. \\"Population Biology of the Rhizoctonia Solani Complex.\\" Population Genetics of Soilborne Fungal Plant Pathogens 87.4 (1997): 480‚Äì84. The American Phytopathological Society. Web. 4 Oct. 2011.], The American Phytopathological Society. Cereals in regions of England, South Australia, Canada, and India experience losses caused by R, solani every year. Roots are killed back, causing plants to be stunted and spindly. Other noncereal plants in those regions can experience brown stumps as another symptom of the pathogen. In England, this is called purple patch. R. solani can also cause hypocotyl and stem cankers on mature plants of tomatoes, potatoes, and cabbages. Strands of mycelium and sometimes sclerotia appear on their surfaces. Roots turn brown and die after a period of time. The best known symptom of R. solani is black scurf on potato tubers, which are the sclerotia of the fungus. Symptoms on common beans, Rhizoctonia damping off, blight, and rot  Disease cycle  R. solani can survive in the soil for many years in the form of sclerotia. Sclerotia of Rhizoctonia have thick outer layers to allow for survival, and they function as the overwintering structure for the pathogen. In some rare cases (such as the teleomorph) the pathogen may also take on the form of mycelia that reside in the soil, as well. The fungus is attracted to the plant by chemical stimuli released by a growing plant and/or decomposing plant residue. The process of penetration of a host can be accomplished in a number of ways. Entry can occur through direct penetration of the plant cuticle/epidermis or by means of natural openings in the plant. Hyphae come in contact with the plant and attach to the plant by which through growth they begin to produce an appressorium which penetrates the plant cell and allows for the pathogen to obtain nutrients from the plant cell. The pathogen can also release enzymes that break down plant cell walls, and continues to colonize and grow inside dead tissue. This breakdown of the cell walls and colonization of the pathogen within the host forms the sclerotia. New inoculum is produced on or within the host tissue, and a new cycle is repeated when new plants become available. The disease cycle begins as such: # Sclerotia/mycelium overwinter in plant debris, soil, or host plants. # The young hyphae and fruiting basidia (rare) emerge and produce mycelia and rarely basidiospores. # The very rare production of the germinating basidiospores penetrate the stoma, whereas the mycelia land on the plant surface and secrete the necessary enzymes onto the plant surface to initiate invasion of the host plant. # After the mycelia successfully invade the host, necrosis and sclerotia form in and around the infected tissue which then leads to the various symptoms associated with the disease, such as soil rot, stem rot, damping off, etc. and the process begins all over again.[Ceresini, Paulo. \\"Rhizoctonia Solani.\\" Rhizoctonia Solani. NC State University. Web. 04 November 2011 .], NC State University Rhizoctonia Solani.  Environment  The pathogen is known to prefer warm, wet weather, and outbreaks typically occur in the early summer months. Most symptoms of the pathogen do not occur until late summer, thus most farmers do not become aware of the diseased crop until harvest. A combination of environmental factors has been linked to the prevalence of the pathogen, such as presence of host plant, frequent rainfall/irrigation, and increased temperatures in spring and summer. In addition, a reduction of drainage of the soil due to various techniques such as soil compaction are also known to create favorable environments for the pathogen.[\\"Rhizoctonia Diseases.\\" Michigan Potato Diseases. P.S. Wharton, Michigan State University, 2 May 2011. Web. 04 Oct. 2011. .], P.S Wharton Michigan State University. The pathogen is dispersed as sclerotia, and these sclerotia can travel by means of wind, water, or soil movement between host plants.  Identification  R. solani infection on cucumber R. solani does not produce spores, hence is identified only from mycelial characteristics or DNA analysis. Its hyphal cells are multinucleated. It produces white to deep brown mycelium when grown on an artificial medium. The hyphae are 4‚Äì15 Œºm wide and tend to branch at right angles. A septum near each hyphal branch and a slight constriction at the branch are diagnostic. R. solani is subdivided into anastomosis groups based on hyphal fusion between compatible strains. APSnet Education Center ‚Äì Plant Disease Lessons ‚Äì Rhizoctonia diseases of turfgrass ‚Äì Pathogen Biology. Plant Pathology / Plant Disease Online ‚Äì The American Phytopathological Society. The teleomorph of R. solani is Thanatephorus cucumeris. It forms club-shaped basidia with four apical sterigmata on which oval, hyaline basidiospores are borne. Management Complete control of Rhizoctonia species is not possible, but the severity of the pathogen can be limited. Successful control depends on characteristics of the pathogen, host crops, and the environment.[Uchida, Janice Y. \\"Rhizoctonia Solani.\\" Knowledge Master. Web. 04 Oct. 2011. .], Janice Uchilda Knowledge Master. Controlling the environment, crop rotation, using resistant varieties, and minimizing soil compaction are effective and noninvasive ways to manage disease. Planting seedlings in warmer soil and getting plants to emerge quickly helps minimize damage. Crop rotation also helps minimize the amount of inoculum that results in infection. A few resistant varieties with moderate resistance to Rhizoctonia can be used, but they produce lower yields and quantity than standard varieties. Minimizing soil compaction helps water infiltration, drainage, and aeration for the plants. One specific chemical option is a chemical spray PCNB, which is known to be the best solution to reducing damping off of seeds on host plants. To minimize disease, certified seed free of sclerotia can be planted. Seed growers should only purchase sclerotia-free seeds when planting their crops since sclerotia can overwinter in the soil and may not show symptoms right away. Although fungicides are not the most effective way to manage this pathogen, a few that have been approved by the USDA for control of the pathogen. Chemical company representatives can recommend which group of fungicides would be most effective with crops in regard to R. solani. As long as seed growers stay clear of wet, poorly drained areas while also avoiding susceptible crops, R. solani is not usually a problem. Diseases caused by this pathogen are more severe in soils that are moderately wet and a temperature range of 15‚Äì18 ¬∞C.[Anderson, Neil. \\"The Genetics and Pathology of Rhizoctonia Solani.\\" Annual Review of Phytopathology 20.329-47 (1982): 331‚Äì38.]  Economic importance  Rhizoctonia can be found across all areas of the United States (environmental conditions permitting) where its host crops are located. The severity of infection can vary and for highly infected patches, severity of the infection can be very devastating to the farmer. Some of these consequences are major yield losses (from 25% to 100%), increased soil tare (because the soil sticks to the fungus' mycelium), and poor industrial quality of the crops based on increased levels of sodium, potassium, and nitrogen. Due to the number of hosts that the pathogen attacks, these consequences are numerous and detrimental to a variety of crops. Sheath blight caused by this pathogen is the second-most devastating disease after rice blast.Molecular Plant Pathology (2013) 14(9), 910‚Äì922  Genome  The draft genome of R. solani strain Rhs1AP covers 51.7 Mbp, although the heterokaryotic genome of this strain was estimated at 86 Mb, based on an optical map of the chromosomes. The discrepancy is explained by the aneuploid, highly repetitive genome of this species which prevented sequencing (or assembling) the complete DNA. The genome is predicted to encode 12,726 genes. Another strain, AG1-IB 7/3/14, was recently sequenced too.

He was imprisoned by the English and died on St. Patrick's Day in 1870. Early life Glasnevin Dublin, John Keegan 'Leo' Casey He was born in Mount Dalton, County Westmeath to a teacher during the height of the Great Hunger of 1846. Eight years later he moved to Gurteen, near Ballymahon in County Longford, when his father was given the post of head master at the local school. Casey's work would come to be closely associated with Ballymahon. As a teenager he worked as an assistant to his father and was expected to follow him into teaching; however, he was disillusioned by the insufficiently nationalistic nature of the curriculum and spent a great deal of time writing poetry. It was at this time, reputedly at the age of fifteen, that he wrote his best-known song, \\"The Rising of the Moon\\", which commemorates the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Fenians Following the increasing popularity of his songs and ballads at nationalist gatherings, he moved to Dublin in the 1860s and became active in the Fenian movement. He was a major contributor to The Nation newspaper, for which he assumed his pen-name of 'Leo'. In 1866, at the age of 20, he published a collection of poems, entitled A Wreath of Shamrocks; most of the poems therein had already been published elsewhere, primarily in The Nation. The further fame engendered by the success of the book led him to be sought after as a speaker; he addressed mass rallies in Dublin, Liverpool and London that year, in the lead up to the Fenian Rising in 1867. Imprisonment When the uprising failed, he was imprisoned without trial for eight months in Mountjoy Prison. Casey was released on the understanding that he would leave for Australia and not return to Ireland. However, he chose to stay on in Summerhill, Dublin in disguise, living as a Quaker and continuing to write and publish in secret. Death He married Mary Josephine Briscoe in January 1868 and she bore a son Michael, who died shortly after birth in October 1869. His health had been broken by the treatment he had received in prison. He fell from a cab on or near O‚ÄôConnell Bridge in the centre of Dublin in 1870. He died from his injuries. Following his death, on St. Patrick's Day in 1870, he was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. The newspapers reported that between fifty and one hundred thousand mourners walked in his funeral procession.

The story begins when Manhattan attorney Anson Page (Richard Egan) returns to his Southern roots after 15 years, arriving in Pompey's Head, South Carolina, to investigate the mystery surrounding missing royalties due famous author Garvin Wales (Sidney Blackmer). In the small Southern town, Page sees the same problems of racial and class prejudices that had once prompted him to leave Pompey's Head. However, he also encounters his former flame, Dinah Blackford (Dana Wynter), who has married businessman Mickey Higgins (Cameron Mitchell). While their romance is rekindled, various secrets of the past rise to the surface. Child actors Charles Herbert and Evelyn Rudie were in the cast, along with an appearance by DeForest Kelley. Elmer Bernstein provided the music score. Released November 4, 1955, the film was retitled Secret Interlude in the UK.

Biography Born in Maastricht, Merode's father was mayor of Brussels during the period in which modern Belgium formed part of France. Under the First French Empire, Merode lived in Paris. In 1809 he married Rosalie de Gramont, niece by marriage of the Marquis de Lafayette. Merode settled in the southern part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands--modern Belgium--and was one of the leaders of the Belgian Revolution of 1830. He served in the Provisional Government of Belgium and in the Belgian National Congress which was elected in November 1830. Merode was proposed as a candidate for the throne of the newly created Belgium, but refused to be considered as he was not a prince, merely a count. Merode's brother Fr√©d√©ric was killed during the fighting against the forces of King William I following the revolution. He formed part of the delegation to Paris which sought to have Louis, Duke of Nemours, second son of King Louis-Philippe, accept the throne, but this approach was rebuffed by the French king. Merode was a confidant of the eventual king, Leopold I, and was made a Minister of State in 1831. He served as Foreign affairs, War, and Finance minister in the 1830s. He resigned from office in 1839 as he was unwilling to sign the Treaty of London ceding Belgian territory to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert was his son in law, and Montalembert's political ideas were supported by Merode. His son Fr√©d√©ric- Fran√ßois-Xavier Ghislain de M√©rode served as a minister to Pope Pius IX.  Honours  * : Iron Cross. * : Minister of State, By Royal Decree.

The answer is 14. This result was first published by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1922. The problem gained wide exposure three decades later as an exercise in John L. Kelley's classic textbook General Topology. Proof Letting S denote an arbitrary subset of a topological space, write kS for the closure of S, and cS for the complement of S. The following three identities imply that no more than 14 distinct sets are obtainable: (1) kkS = kS. (The closure operation is idempotent.) (2) ccS = S. (The complement operation is an involution.) (3) kckckckcS = kckcS. (Or equivalently kckckckS = kckckckccS = kckS. Using identity (2).) The first two are trivial. The third follows from the identity kikiS = kiS where iS is the interior of S which is equal to the complement of the closure of the complement of S, iS = ckcS. (The operation ki = kckc is idempotent.) A subset realizing the maximum of 14 is called a 14-set. The space of real numbers under the usual topology contains 14-sets. Here is one example: :(0,1)\\\\cup(1,2)\\\\cup{3}\\\\cup\\\\bigl([4,5]\\\\cap\\\\Q\\\\bigr), where (1,2) denotes an open interval and [4,5] denotes a closed interval. Further results Despite its origin within the context of a topological space, Kuratowski's closure- complement problem is actually more algebraic than topological. A surprising abundance of closely related problems and results have appeared since 1960, many of which have little or nothing to do with point-set topology. The closure-complement operations yield a monoid which can be used to classify topological spaces. References External links  * The Kuratowski Closure-Complement Theorem by B. J.

Signs and symptoms Features of this syndrome include Peters' anomaly, corneal opacity, central defect of Descemet's membrane, and shallow anterior chamber with synechiae between the iris and cornea. Craniofacial abnormalities commonly seen in patients with PPS include hypertelorism, ear malformations, micrognathia, round face and broad neck, and cleft lip and palette. Infants are commonly born small for gestational age and have delayed growth. It is associated with short limb dwarfism and mild to severe intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Cause The pattern of inheritance of Peters- plus is autosomal recessive, where both parents are heterozygous they can produce a child with the syndrome. The B3GALTL (now called B3GLCT) gene codes for the enzyme beta 3-glucosyltransferase (B3Glc-T). The beta 3-glucosyltransferase enzyme is responsible for glycosylation, the attachment of sugars to proteins, which through this modification allows for performance of a wider variety of functions. The mutations of the B3GLCT gene in affected individuals results in loss-of-function of the beta 3-glucosyltransferase enzyme. The result of this disruption in glycosylation is a change to the secondary structure of the mRNA. These mutations of the B3GLCT gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the beta 3-glucosyltransferase (B3Glc-T) enzyme, which disrupts glycosylation. The phenotypic effects of the B3GLCT mutations result in a triad of well known phenotypes; Peters anomaly (also classified as anterior segment defects, a defect in the anterior cornea), short stature, brachydactyly, in addition to several other less frequently observed phenotypes. A study of 55 patients with Peters-plus-related phenotypes, but lacking the most common combination (Peters anomaly, short stature, and brachydactyly), revealed none of those cases displayed mutation in the B3GLCT gene. Thus PPS-like signs and symptoms, when they occur independently of each other, provide strong evidence that the B3GLCT gene mutation is in fact responsible for actual cases Peters-plus syndrome.

He challenged the quizmaster, a local antiques dealer, to bid ¬£100 for a rugby jersey in an auction we held on the same evening for the charity. He was quite rude and objectionable and his comments didn't go down well ‚Äì I think he'd had a few beers.\\" In 2012, Ramsay was criticised for missing a committee session; after an evening's drinking in Cardiff at a leaving party for a Labour member of staff at a Cardiff Bay pub before heading into town at closing time for a late city centre bar. He failed to notify the clerk that he was ill until two hours after the meeting was due to start. when an email was received by the clerk from a member of Mr Ramsay‚Äôs staff to say he had been taken ill during the night. Ramsay was not in the Assembly chamber for the majority of the afternoon‚Äôs session, but arrived at 5.25pm to vote on a Liberal Democrat motion of no confidence in Health Minister Lesley Griffiths. In 2014, Ramsay was accused of having been drunk during a debate in the Assembly. The Assembly‚Äôs Presiding Officer had to launch an investigation after she received a complaint alleging that a Tory AM appeared \\"drunk\\" and made \\"slurred, incoherent and insolent\\" contributions to a debate on mental health in the Senedd, but he denies being drunk. Ramsay, who also celebrated his birthday that day, had intervened twice during a speech by health minister Prof Mark Drakeford AM, who at one point told him he would pursue the matters raised directly with him outside the confines of the debate. An online clip demonstrated the awkwardness of the debate. Presiding Officer, Dame Rosemary Butler, did not support the claim and no further action was taken. Ramsay criticised the proposed ¬£10,000 pay rise for assembly members prior to the 2016 election and stated that he would donate his pay rise to charity. The Western Mail reported in 2019 that Ramsay had not responded to questions that asked which charity his pay raise had been donated to. The editor of the Monmouthshire Beacon stated that, at a meeting with Ramsay in 2018, Ramsay said he did not wish to make a public announcement at this stage because of the nature of the charity and that the money is tied with an ongoing charitable project which will be announced later in the year. As of March 2019, no announcement had been made.

Early life Manookian was the oldest of three children born to a Christian Armenian family in Istanbul.Gard, 2011, p. 39 As a teenager, he survived the Armenian Genocide. Manookian immigrated to the United States in 1920. At the age of 16 he studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design. Later he took classes at the Art Students League of New York before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps in 1923. While serving in the U. S. Marine Corps he was assigned as a clerk to the author and historian, Major Edwin North McClellan. Career Hawaiian Boy and Girl, mural by Arman Manookian Men in an Outrigger Canoe Headed for Shore, 1929 In 1927, Manookian was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps, but remained in Hawaii. He worked for the Honolulu Star- Bulletin and for Paradise of the Pacific. While in the Marines, Manookian had supplied illustrations for Leatherneck Magazine and produced about 75 ink drawings for McClellan‚Äôs history of the United States Marine Corps, which was never published. These drawings are now in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art. His oil paintings are rare and highly valued based on their almost iconic status and scarcity due to his early death, by suicide, in 1931. Only 31 of his oil paintings are known to exist.Gard, 2011, p. 36 The Honolulu Academy of Arts held a memorial exhibition shortly after Manookian‚Äôs death and a retrospective exhibition titled Meaning in Color/Expression in Line: Arman Manookian‚Äôs Modernism Nov. 4, 2010 through April 24, 2011.

Description The stone first appears in historical records in the 17th century when Johannes Bureus (1568-1652) wrote down parts of its message. Remarkable neither in size or beauty but famed through its prominent location in the pathway of tens of thousands of tourists and school children, this fragment of a runestone is one of three runestone found in the old town. As preserved written records from the old town give no hints of a developed knowledge in writing and reading runes in Stockholm and as these stones are too heavy to be transported very far, they are believed to have been brought in from the surrounding rural outskirts of the city, presumably from any of the Iron Age settlements of which traces have been discovered on both Norrmalm and S√∂dermalm and considerably older than the city itself. In situ About half a metre tall and richly decorated with an arabesque of winding loops, the body of the dragon still carries fragments of the commemorative message: \\"Torsten and Fr√∂gunn had the stone erected after their son\\", the name of the latter remains unknown. While the stone is not signed and its style can not be associated with any known runemaster, it is typical for stones carved in Uppland, north of Stockholm, during the later part of the 11th century. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is considered to be Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. An interesting detail of the inscription is the cross-shaped engraving on centre right, probably added to the stone after its completion to underline its Christian message. A laser range scanner analysis of the stone was made by Laila Kitzler √Öhfeldt and Magnus K√§llstr√∂m in 2000. 16 scans of individual grooves on the stone were processed mathematically to produce 3D-charts. These unveiled statistical differences in the depth and shapes of the grooves, variations interpreted as stroke patterns from more than one carver. The result showed the ornaments of the stone were most likely cut by an experienced master (deep grooves, regular stroke pattern) and a less proficient apprentice (more shallow grooves, irregular strokes), while the cross shape might very well have been added after the stone was erected (when the weight of the mason tools quickly makes the cutting awkward). The stone on Pr√§stgatan is however both damaged and shabby, and as the laser analysis have proven an accuracy of about 80 per cent on freshly cut stones, the analysis is far from certain. A second runestone found in the old town, U 274, originally located in a wall by the southern city gate near Slussen, is today kept in the Museum of Medieval Stockholm. It contains the words \\"Karl and Adisla had [this stone] erected [after] Arnsil, [their] father\\" and is similar in style to stones found in S√∂dermanland south of Stockholm. The third runestone, U 54, is today lost but was once located in a stairway in the church Riddarholmskyrkan.

Playing career=Club M√°ndi was born in Budapest, Hungary. As a footballer, he was dubbed \\"the artist of positioning, and world champion of timing.\\" Playing club football, he won 10 league titles. He was part of the greatest era of MTK, the 1920s and 1930s. He was signed by MTK in 1919 at 20 years of age.The Names Heard Long Ago; How the Golden Age of Hungarian Soccer Shaped the Modern Game He played alongside the likes of Franz Platko, B√©la Guttmann, Guszt√°v Sebes, Jen≈ë K√°lm√°r, Imre Schlosser, Iuliu Baratky and Ferenc Sas. Between 1919 and 1925 he won seven consecutive championships with MTK. The professionalisation of the game in Hungary weakened MTK's absolute dominance, but they remained amongst the leading sides. Until the end of his career in 1937, he could celebrate three more championships. Between 1923 and 1933, he also won cups with the club; altogether, M√°ndi made 325 appearances for MTK. International 1924 Maygar team; K√°roly Fogl, Zolt√°n Opata, Ferenc Hirzer, Rudolf Jeny, J√≥zsef Eisenhoffer, B√©la Guttmann, Gyula M√°ndi, G√°bor Obitz, J√≥zsef Braun, Gy√∂rgy Orth, J√°nos Biri, and Gyula Kiss M√°ndi's career with the Hungarian national football team commenced in June 1921 with a match against Germany. Soon he featured regularly in the side, forming the defense together with K√°roly Fogl. He won 32 international caps. Hungary participated in the football tournament of the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris. Hungary's hopes rose after a decisive first round win over Poland. However, a sensational 0‚Äì3 defeat at the hands of Egypt in the second stage ended the aspirations of the Magyars. M√°ndi played in both matches. A knee injury prevented M√°ndi from continuing his international career until 1929, when he again featured regularly until 1932, including five matches for the Central European International Cup. After missing out on further nominations for a two years, he returned once more to the Hungarian side for a World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria in 1934. Altogether he played 32 times for his country. Nazi occupation Mandi survived the Holocaust during the Nazi occupation of Poland in World War II with the assistance of his Christian brother-in-law, Gy√∂rgy Szomol√°nyi. Szomol√°nyi was the managing director of a paper mill that had been converted to produce wooden stocks for rifles to support the Nazi war effort. He was able to employ whomever he wished. In 1942 he saved M√°ndi from a Jewish labor detail by giving M√°ndi papers to work in his factory. Two years later, however, M√°ndi couldn‚Äôt avoid labor service. He was sent on a train bound for Ukraine, but wrote a postcard to Szomol√°nyi and threw it from the train. Someone found it and mailed it, but when it arrived it had been torn, and all that could be read was the word ‚ÄòKELPUSZTA‚Äô. Szomol√°nyi realised this must be Ekelpuszta, where a transit camp had been set up. He donned his World War I officer‚Äôs uniform, strode into the camp, and demanded that he be given five men for an essential task. Impressed, the guards told him to take his pick. Szomol√°nyi selected M√°ndi and four others. Coaching career After retiring as a player, M√°ndi became a coach and was the manager of the Hungary national football team during the era of the Mighty Magyars. His training regimen for the team was unusual for the time, as he encouraged the men to practice athletics and mountaineering, and to train with the ball and in match situations. From 1956 to 1958 he coached Brazil. In mid-August 1957 M√°ndi became coach of America FC in Rio de Janeiro. His spell there with a mid-table placing at the State Championship of Rio 1957 and a joint last place at the Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament of 1958 was considered unsatisfactory and ended at the end of April 1958. Between 1959 and 1964, Mandi had two spells as coach of Israel, with whom he reached the final of the 1960 Asian Cup.

His maternal grandparents were from Stolp, Pomerania, now within Poland, and after moving to Australia in the 1870s they became farmers at Burnt Creek, Victoria. His paternal grandfather was from North Carolina, USA, and died for the Confederates in the American Civil War. Upon his death, Stokes‚Äô father went to sea at the age of 14 due to the destitution at home. He eventually joined the Calcutta Police Force in India and came to Victoria in the 1870s when his first wife's health deteriorated. There were no children. After her death in 1894, his father, then one of the first plainclothes detectives in the Victorian Police Force, married his first wife's nurse in 1895. They had six children, the youngest being ‚ÄòJack‚Äô Stokes. After the death of his father, Jack left school in 1924 at the age of 14 and joined the Victorian Railways as a ‚Äúboy labourer‚Äù. Later, realising that there was no future in the position, he studied at night to become a clerical officer and during the Great Depression, accepted a transfer to the Victorian Taxation Department. There he languished in boredom until a fortuitous glance at a recruitment advertisement for police in the Northern Territory changed his life. On 31 December 1936 he joined the Northern Territory Police, caught a ship to Darwin and over the next 20 years rose to be Administrative Inspector and Acting Superintendent. On arrival in Darwin on 8 January 1937, he learned that training was acquired on the job. He began patrolling the streets the next day. The work included several patrols into outback areas, and in September 1937 he was sent for a year to Elcho Island, off Arnhem Land, to deter Japanese pearlers from prostituting Aboriginal women. At Elcho and elsewhere as the lone policeman in an extensive remote area, he travelled widely with the Aboriginals observing their country and culture, helping to resolve disputes and administering first aid. Journalist Colin Bednall, who visited Elcho on the monthly supply vessel, described Stokes‚Äô camp as a ‚Äúveritable wonder-home‚Äù, with gardens and sheds around the main tent. An airstrip was cleared with Aboriginal labour. His final report on departure was commended for its ‚Äòfairness and honesty‚Äô by the Chief Protector of Aborigines and years later he was remembered affectionately by locals. Six months after leaving Elcho, it was discovered that Stokes had broken his spine in an accident before going to Elcho and now, after working for two years without knowing it, the spine was collapsing. He was sent to Melbourne where 7 inches were taken off the tibia of his left leg and five vertebrae fused together. He recuperated in bed for four months before returning to work in Darwin. At the outbreak of World War Two in September 1939, Stokes applied for leave to join the Australian Army but was refused because his police work was considered an essential service. During the war he was in charge of the police district centred on Maranboy, south of Katherine, which was then a tin mining camp. He married Edna on 31 January 1940 and she became a vital unpaid contributor to the smooth operation of each of the police stations to which they were posted. Later, in retirement, he described his time in the Territory as the most fulfilling part of his career. Reflecting on a brief return by Stokes to the Territory in 1977, Darwin journalist Alan Wauchope described him as ‚Äúthe kindest and gentlest policeman of them all.‚Äù Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, he was appointed the second Official Representative (now Administrator) of the Australian Government on the remote Indian Ocean Territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Island were acquired in 1957 from the United Kingdom prior to the independence of Singapore-Malaysia. He officially assumed the position on 8 November and arrived on the Islands on 15 November after briefings in Canberra and Perth. He served until 27 July 1960 when he left on leave. On 3 August 1960 his appointment was officially terminated by the Minister for Territories, Paul Hasluck, effective from 30 September 1960, and was appointed from the next day the second Official Representative of Christmas Island. Both communities were small, isolated and multicultural and required considerable sensitivity and understanding in their administration. On his departure from Christmas Island in May 1966 he was lauded for these qualities by all sectors, organisations and clubs of the Island. For example, the leader of the Cocos Malay Kampong, Mr Bytol bin Zanley, said in a speech at a farewell function that he would be remembered as ‚Äú... a good friend and administrator for all he has done for the good of the people and of the community‚Äù; and the President of the Chinese Literary Association at a similar function said that, ‚Äúthe credit for the happy state of affairs in the Territory where the communities live in harmony goes to Mr Stokes, who, has served the peoples well by his meritorious services and administration. He has achieved much in the fields of welfare and education...(treating)...all people alike, both young and old, poor and rich. He has been most kind to them.‚Äù His period as Official Representative of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and of Christmas Island is described from a son's point of view in \\"Whatever will be, I'll see. Volume 1\\". In June 1966, he assumed a position with the Department of Territories in Canberra and, on retirement in 1970, was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth for ‚Äúdistinguished public service‚Äù. He died on 3 August 1995, aged 85, and his wife on 12 April 2009, aged 95. They are survived by six children, 24 grandchildren and an increasing number of their children. References * Another N.T.

The two reportshttp://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/25607/1/Access%20to%20Finance%20Report%20No%201.pdfhttp://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/25608/1/access%20to%20finance%20stage%202%20review.pdf produced by the review were not without controversy as they criticised the Welsh Government's own investment fund Finance Wales as being unfit for purpose, mainly because of the high interest rates charged to businesses and the unwillingness to consider using state aid rules to make finance affordable to Welsh firms. He recommended the creation of a new Development Bank to support funding for Welsh SMEs. He was subsequently appointed chair of the Development Bank for Wales Task and Finish Group which drew up a detailed plan for the creation of this body by the Welsh Government.

It is closely related to the human T‚Äëlymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I). BLV may integrate into the genomic DNA of B‚Äëlymphocytes as a DNA intermediate (the provirus), or exist as unintegrated circular or linear forms. Besides structural and enzymatic genes required for virion production, BLV contains an oncogene coding for a protein called Tax and expresses microRNAs of unknown function. In cattle, most infected animals are asymptomatic; leukemia is rare (about 5% of infected animals), but lymphoproliferation is more frequent (30%). Disease in cattle=Transmission Many potential routes of BLV transmission exist. Transmission through procedures that transmit blood between animals such as gouge dehorning, vaccination and ear tagging with instruments or needles that are not changed or disinfected between animals is a significant means of BLV spread. Rectal palpation with common sleeves poses a risk that is increased by inexperience and increased frequency of palpation. Transmission via colostrum, milk, and in utero exposure is generally considered to account for a relatively small proportion of infections. Embryo transfer and artificial insemination also account for a small number of new infections if common equipment and/or palpation sleeves are used. While transmission has been documented via blood feeding insects, the significance of this risk is unclear. Transmission relies primarily on the transfer of infected lymphocytes from one animal to the next, and BLV positive animals with lymphocytosis are more likely to provide a source for infection. Virus particles are difficult to detect and not used for transmission of infection. Clinical signs Conjunctival prolapse is a sign of bovine leukosis In general, BLV causes only a benign mononucleosis-like disease in cattle. Only some animals later develop a B-cell leukemia called enzootic bovine leukosis. Under natural conditions the disease is transmitted mainly by milk to the calf. The variety of organs where white blood cells occur explains the many symptoms: enlargement of superficial lymph nodes, a digestive form, a cardiac form, a nervous form, a respiratory form, and others. Lymph node enlargement is often an early clinical sign.Bovine Leukaemia Virus reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 10 October 2011. An unexpected clinical finding is protrusion of the conjunctival membrane, due to enlargement of retro-ocular lymph nodes. Diagnosis Diagnosis relies on agar gel immunodiffusion, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Post-mortem findings are characteristic and include widespread white tumours in most organs. Treatment and control No treatment is available for the disease. Testing and removing positive animals from the herd is one method of control. In herds where the disease is widespread, it is important to limit spread by avoiding contact with blood between animals. Epidemiology and eradication efforts In Europe attempts were made to eradicate the virus by culling infected animals. The first country considered to be free of infection was Denmark. Soon the United Kingdom followed. Like the North American states, those of the Eastern bloc in Europe did not try to get rid of the virus. But the Eastern Europe states started to become leukosis-free after the political changes at the end of the last century. A quote from a USDA fact sheet, \\"The high individual animal prevalence of BLV reported in the Dairy 1996 study suggests that testing and culling seropositive animals may not be a cost effective method to control the disease. Instead, preventing disease transmission by implementing preventive practices would likely be more cost- effective.[6] High prevalence of virus was found from testing by USDA. \\"As part of the 2007 dairy study, bulk tank milk was collected from 534 operations with 30 or more dairy cows and tested with an Enzyme Linked-Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies against BLV. Results showed that 83.9 percent of U.S. dairy operations were positive for BLV (table 1).[8] BLV infection can be detected by ELISA or PCR.[7] Potential infection in humans Soon after BLV was discovered in the 1970s, ten studies were done looking for antibodies to BLV in humans. However, no antibodies were found and so researchers concluded that BLV was not a risk to human health. However, more sensitive techniques for detecting antibodies were developed, and in 2003 a test of more than 200 people using these new tests found that more than a third carried antibodies reactive to BLV, and the question began to be researched again. Several studies have been carried out to determine whether BLV causes disease in humans, testing mostly farm workers who drink raw milk from infected cows.[9] Some long term studies may be necessary, as there appears to be a correlation in instances of cancer among butchers and slaughterhouse workers. In 2014, researchers discovered the presence of BLV positive cells in the human breast tissue in a sample of US women, and a case- control study published in 2015 suggested that exposure to BLV is associated with breast cancer, also in US women. A later study of Australian women detected retrotranscribed BLV DNA in breast tissue of 40/50(80%) of women with breast cancer versus 19/46(41%) of women with no history of breast cancer, indicating an age-adjusted odds ratio and confidence interval of 4.72(1.71-13.05). These results corroborate the findings of the previous study of US women with an even higher odds ratio for the Australian population. A case-control study of Texas women established an association between BLV presence in breast tissue and breast cancer status with an odds ratio OR 5.1. Another case-control study conducted on Chinese patients did not find any association between BLV and breast cancer. However this study did not look at tissue samples from breast cancer, only blood work. A subsequent evaluation of the Chinese study pointed out weaknesses in methodology used, e.g. a veterinary test kit designed and calibrated for cattle inappropriately used to test for human antibodies, despite warnings against this in kit instructions. An exhaustive analysis of 51 whole genomes of breast cancers by next generation sequencing (NGS) did not show any trace of BLV DNA and thus excludes clonal insertion (integration into human genomic DNA) of BLV into the DNA of breast cancer cells. However, all of the DNA sequences available to examine were derived from metastatic sites, according to the statement by the provider (US National Cancer Institute) written above the column of the sequences. In cattle with advanced stages of BLV infection, most of the BLV genome is deleted and often only the promoter region and cancer causing gene remain []. If this situation also exists in humans infected with BLV, one would not expect to find BLV in whole genomes of metastatic tumors, which are advanced stages of human breast cancer. Also unintegrated BLV DNA would not be detected by NGS. More research needs to be done to determine if there are differences in BLV presence in metastatic versus primary breast cancer cells from the same human tissue donor. Another study of 95 women in California found that more than a third had evidence of BLV DNA in their blood cells, and a third had antibodies to BLV, but that these two BLV markers were not correlated with each other in individual donors. Infection in other species Natural infection of animals other than cattle and buffalo are rare, although many animals are susceptible to artificial infection. After artificial infection of sheep most animals succumb to leukemia. Rabbits get a fatal AIDS-like disease similar to Pasteurella, different from the benign human snuffles. It is not known whether this naturally occurring rabbit disease is linked to BLV infection. \\"Although several species can be infected by inoculation of the virus, natural infection occurs only in cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus), water buffaloes, and capybaras. Sheep are very susceptible to experimental inoculation and develop tumours more often and at a younger age than cattle. A persistent antibody response can also be detected after experimental infection in deer, rabbits, rats, guinea-pigs, cats, dogs, sheep, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, antelopes, pigs, goats and buffaloes.\\" Research directions Because of the close relationship between BLV and HTLV-I, the research on BLV is important. One can use the experience with BLV for understanding HTLV-I induced diseases like ATL (adult T-cell leukemia) and HAM/TSP (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/Tropical spastic paraparesis)-like neurological disorders. A number of case-control studies have been conducted, but research into BLV-related diseases has not been as extensive as that conducted into other viral diseases. Cattle vaccine Researchers have been working on developing an attenuated provirus vaccine for bovines. The theory is to create a provirus with a deletion in the pathogenic gene that confers oncogenesis (tax). This vaccine would be able to induce a persistent anti-BLV immune response through maintaining a low level of infectivity, while preventing the risk of infection by the wild-type virus which maintains the ability to drive oncogenesis. However, attempts thus far have not been able to create a vaccine that is easily transmitted from mother to offspring.

James (March 14, 1914 - June 10, 1933) was an American Thoroughbred horse racing jockey. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, James was a very promising young jockey who began racing in 1930 at age seventeen. According to TIME magazine, he \\"made a sensation\\" in his first season of racing. Although he didn't start until June, his 138 wins that year ranked him fourth among all North American jockeys. Among his first major wins, he guided the filly Cousin Jo to victory in the 1931 Kentucky Oaks. In 1932, Eugene James was the jockey for Burgoo King, a colt owned by the prominent horseman Col. Edward R. Bradley of Idle Hour Stock Farm. James rode Burgoo King to victory in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The horse was not entered in the Belmont Stakes. Unfortunately, Eugene James had problems maintaining his weight and suffered from bulimia that became so severe he had to stop riding. Though he was not racing, he was in Chicago, Illinois in June 1933 when the season at Arlington Park and Hawthorne Race Course was in full swing. During the evening of June 10, the twenty-year-old James and two friends went to Chicago's popular Oak Street Beach on Lake Michigan where he went swimming, and drowned.

Howard, known more commonly as Charlie Howard, (30 May 1942 ‚Äì 2 May 2017) was an American politician and had been a member of the Texas House of Representatives since 1995. He was a member of the Republican Party. Howard was a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), serving as Texas state leader. Early life and career After moving to Sugar Land, Texas, a fast-growing suburb of Houston at the time, Charlie Howard became involved in the Sugar Land community, at one time serving as President of the Fort Bend Chamber of Commerce, which is highly influential in Fort Bend County and also of which he is a life member. He was also a founding director of the Fort Bend Economic Development Council and has served as President of The C. Howard Company, which specializes in real estate development. Prior experience included serving as Executive Vice President and Operating Officer of Sugarland Properties, which developed the First Colony master-planned community that now comprises most of the southern and southeastern areas of both Sugar Land and State House District 26. Additionally, Howard had been involved in numerous charitable, political, business, religious and educational organizations. Political career In 1994, Charlie Howard ran in the Republican primary for District 26 in the Texas House of Representatives, which is demographically dominated by Sugar Land, against incumbent Republican Jim Tallas, who succeeded Tom DeLay in 1984 after DeLay made a successful run for Congress. Howard made an issue of Tallas' resistance to term limits, which was exhibited when the latter (as chair of a subcommittee) struck down a measure calling for term limits in the Texas Legislature. Using this issue as the centerpiece of his campaign, Howard defeated Tallas with 71 percent of the vote in the primary, which was considered the real contest in the heavily Republican district, which has not elected a Democrat since 1978. In fact, Howard had faced a Democratic challenger only once, in 2000, winning with 70% of the vote, and had, with the exception of 1996 (when he faced only a token third-party candidate), won without opposition in other previous general election cycles. After being elected, Howard had developed a largely conservative voting record in the Texas Legislature, and had received awards from various conservative groups, including the Christian Coalition, the Eagle Forum, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Family Association, and Concerned Women of America. He had also been recognized by various publications, including the Houston Chronicle, for his efforts in securing funds for the expansion of U.S. Highway 59, which runs through Sugar Land, and by the Republican Party of Texas for Howard's strong recognition of the party's values. Because of his accomplishments in Austin, Texas Monthly named Charlie Howard among the \\"Worst Legislators\\" three times, ranking seventh worst in 1997 and fourth worst in 1999. In 2007, considered one of the worst legislative sessions in Texas history, Howard was named to the worst list for the third time in his seven sessions. . In 2006, Howard fended off a primary challenge, the first time such a scenario occurred in his political career, but faced no opposition in the general election. In 2008, Howard easily won reelection over his two Republican primary opponents, educator Paula Stansell and student Norm Ley with 63% of the vote. In 2013, Howard chose not to seek re-election due to health issues. Howard died on May 2, 2017, after a long battle with cancer.

She is known to have been a mistress of Louis XIV of France in 1666. Life=Early life Catherine Charlotte de Gramont was the eldest daughter of Marshal, Duke Antoine de Gramont and Fran√ßoise Marguerite du Plessis, a niece of Cardinal Richelieu. Catherine Charlotte's elder brother was Guy Armand de Gramont, the celebrated Count of Guiche, known for his arrogance and good looks, who was successively the lover of Philippe of France, Duke of Orl√©ans and Princess Henrietta of England, husband and wife. Catherine Charlotte was educated in a fashionable convent school, the Visitation Faubourg Saint Jacques in Paris, where many daughters of the aristocracy were educated. She was described as a sophisticated, vivacious, strong-willed beauty.Anne Edwards, The Grimaldis of Monaco, 1992 She fell mutually in love with her cousin, Antonin Nompar, marquis de Puyguilleim, and when her father refused his permission for them to marry, they became lovers all the same. Duchess of Valentinois In March 1660 at the Chateau de Gramont, Catherine married Louis de Grimaldi, the second Duke of Valentinois and heir to the throne of Monaco, who was described as \\"a glorious and avaricious Italian\\". They had six children. The marriage was arranged to strengthen the alliance between Monaco and France against Spain by forging a connection between the Princely House of Monaco and a member of the French high nobility, which could provide valuable connections to the French court. Catherine Charlotte's family connections fit this description, Louis was impressed by her beauty, and the French monarch gave his consent. Catherine Charlotte herself was convinced because her lover refused to elope with her, she was older than most noblewomen when they married, and that her marriage would give her a high rank at the French royal court, which she would not have to leave, at least not until her husband became Prince of Monaco. After marriage, the couple resided in Paris and regularly attended the French court, and Catherine Charlotte continued her relationship with her cousin. Princess of Monaco In 1662, she became Princess of Monaco when her husband succeeded to the throne. Catherine Charlotte was forced to accompany him to Monaco against her will, but Puyguilleim accompanied her on the way in disguise. She remained in Monaco for three years. She did not like her stay in Monaco, where the Princely court did not consist of much more than the Grimaldi relatives and hardly any court life or high society life existed at the time. In 1665, the Prince and Princess of Monaco returned to the French royal court, where Catherine Charlotte was appointed lady-in-waiting to Princess Henrietta of England, sister-in-law and former lover of Louis XIV, with whom she was rumoured to have a bisexual love affair. Her aunt, Suzanne Charlotte de Gramont, marquise de Saint Chaumont, was also a member of Henrietta's household as the governess of her two daughters, Marie Louise and Anne Marie. She continued her love affair with Puyguilleim, but also became involved in a love affair with the Duke de Guiche. She was renowned for her beauty and wits, and attracted many lovers, including the king, the marquis de Villeroi, and her cousin, \\"the little Lauzun\\". Madame de S√©vign√© described her as \\"greedy for pleasure\\", and she was nicknamed Catherine the Torrent. Henrietta encouraged Catherine Charlotte to have an affair with the king to attract him away from his mistress, Louise de la Valli√®re, back to Henrietta. The king's affair with Catherine Charlotte in danger of being exposed to a public scandal because of Catherine Charlotte's other lovers, de Guiche and Puyguilleim: after a scene at court, there was a fear that the rivalry between the three men (as well as her husband) would result in a duel. After the scene, Catherine Charlotte's husband and her lover Duke de Guiche left the court to serve in the war. In the end, the king did leave Louise de la Valli√®re, but after his affair with Catherine Charlotte, he did not return to Henrietta, but begun an affair with Madame de Montespan instead. In 1668, Catherine Charlotte had a love affair with Philippe, Chevalier de Lorraine, lover of the king's brother and Henrietta's husband Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans. Henrietta regarded Lorraine to be her mortal enemy and was deeply offended by the affair, and successfully asked the king to exile Catherine Charlotte from court. At the same time, Catherine Charlotte's long-time lover Puyguilleim married. She returned to Monaco, where she lived a quiet life and remained for four years. In 1672, Catherine Charlotte was able to return to Paris when she was offered a position as lady-in-waiting to the king's mistress, Madame de Montespan. Her employment ended the following year, but she was given her own house in Paris, where she was able to stay. During the following years, however, she fell ill with a progressive cancer.

He played at the tackle position for Princeton University from 1912 to 1914 and was a consensus first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. Ballin served as the head football coach at Duquesne University from 1922 to 1923, compiling a record of 4‚Äì12. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1973. Biography=Early years A native of New York City, Ballin attended the Lawrenceville School before enrolling at Princeton University. He made the Second Testimonial honor roll at Lawrenceville in April 1909. Princeton Ballin later recalled that he was \\"young and underdeveloped\\" when he enrolled at Princeton. He had been unable to make the varsity football team at Lawrenceville and qualified for the fourth and final unit of Princeton's freshman football team in 1911. In 1912, Ballin played as a substitute tackle on Princeton's varsity football team. It was as a junior in 1913 that Ballin became a star. Playing at the right tackle position, Ballin was selected as a consensus first-team All- American in 1913. He was selected as a first-team All-American by, among others, Walter Camp in Collier's Weekly, University of Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost, football historian Parke H. Davis, sports writer Tom Thorp, and the Trenton Evening-Times. In announcing his All-American team, Tom Thorp described Ballin's contributions as follows: > Ballin of Princeton as a playing mate would leave the defensive strength of > the eleven unquestionable. Ballin is a Hercules in size, who has a > wonderfully quick charge and carries his efforts through at all times. The > remarkable defense shown by the Tigers under the shadow of their own goal > posts was due to a great extent to the almost superhuman efforts of Ballin. > In speed and aggressiveness, he would prove a leader of any organization in > the country today. Time and time again when his end would be spilled by the > opposing backs going down under kicks, he broke through and sped down the > field and made the tackle almost as soon as the ball had been caught. In > opening holes for his backs he was without an equal. College Football Hall of Famer Charles Brickley later recalled that Ballin was the hardest-hitting player he ever faced. Brickley said of Ballin: > And the hardest-hitting player I went up against was Ballin ... In that game > against Princeton [in 1913], which was played in a sea of mud, official > statistics verified by a correct counting of my bruises show that I was > knocked down seventy-eight times. Thirty-eight times it was Ballin who was > the catapult force that took me off my pins. Ballin weighed 220 pounds. I > tipped the scales at 180. When the game was over I had gone down to 168. At the meeting of the Princeton football on December 4, 1913, Ballin was elected as the captain of the 1914 football team. At age 20, he was one of the youngest players ever chosen as captain of Princeton's football team. As captain of the 1914 team, Ballin played every minute of every game for Princeton. In recognition of his contributions in 1914, Ballin was selected as a first-team All-American by 21 of 26 recognized selectors, including Walter Camp, Vanity Fair (selected based on the votes of 175 \\"prominent newspapermen of the country\\"), Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune, Frank G. Menke, sporting editor of the International News Service, the New York Herald, and James P. Sinnot of the New York Evening Mail. Ballin is also remembered as the last Princeton football player to play the game without a helmet. Ballin reportedly considered the helmet to be a distraction. According to newspaper accounts of the time, Ballin was \\"known to the sport-following public of the United States as Nig Ballin.\\" Football coach After graduating from Princeton, Ballin became a football coach at Lafayette College. In May 1916, he returned to Princeton as an assistant football coach. Following the entry of the United States into World War I, Ballin enlisted in the United States Marine Corps; he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in July 1917. In the fall of 1917, Ballin was assigned to Fort Crockett on Galveston Island, where he played on the Fort Crockett football team. In December 1918, Lieutenant Ballin coached a football team made up of Marines from the Eight Regiment of the Third Provisional Brigade, United States Marine Corps. In the fall of 1919, after completing his military service, Ballin returned to his position as an assistant football coach at Princeton. In 1921, Ballin was hired as \\"director of football tactics\\" at Shady Side Academy and led the team to a one-loss season. In 1922, Ballin became the head football coach at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ballin continued as head coach for the Duquesne Dukes for the 1922 and 1923 college football seasons. Later years and death After retiring from coaching, Ballin worked as a field engineer in Pittsburgh. In May 1973, Ballin was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in the Pioneer Player category. He was also selected on Princeton's All- Century Team in December 1999.

Career Gould was born in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight. He was the guitarist of Level 42 and occasional saxophone player on their earliest albums. Boon was the brother of Phil Gould, who was the drummer and also a founding member of Level 42. Gould's tenure as a full-time member of Level 42 ended in 1987 after a period of sustained illness and nervous exhaustion, culminating in him suffering from panic attacks whilst on stage. He continued writing lyrics with the group and was present during studio work for the Staring at the Sun album in 1988. Gould released two solo albums: Tin Man and Love Kills Overtime, the second under the pseudonym 'Zen Gangsters'. The second album used a number of his brother's drum samples from his later work with Level 42. Gould maintained a relationship with Mark King, occasionally seen attending King's concerts in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Gould provided lyrics for King's album One Man and the full 2004 reunion of the band was officially announced on his website, although this reunion was very brief. Gould provided lyrics, some guitar work, and some music for the latest Level 42 album Retroglide, although he and King had an agreement that Gould was credited solely for lyrics and King solely for music. Reunions In October 2012, Gould joined his longtime bandmates and friends, Mark King and Mike Lindup, for a one off guest appearance in Bristol, UK. Gould performed alongside the band for the songs \\"Heathrow\\" and \\"Love Games\\". Although Gould had a lot of writing involvement with Level 42 after the dissolution of the original lineup, the Bristol show marked his first public appearance with Level 42 in 25 years. Gould's appearance also coincided with Mark King's birthday. Death Gould was found dead in his home in Devon on 30 April 2019, aged 64. A coroner's inquest found the death was suicide.

It is currently maintained by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as a part of Bullards Beach State Park. History Originally named Bandon Light, Coquille River Light was commissioned in 1895. First lit on February 29, 1896, the light guided mariners past the dangerous shifting sandbars into the Coquille River and harbor at Bandon. The light contained a fourth-order Fresnel lens and connected to the nearby keepers house by a wooden walkway. In September 1936, a large wildfire swept through the surrounding area, and destroyed most of Bandon. The town soon became bankrupt as a result of the decline in shipping. Coquille Light was shut down in 1939 and replaced by an automated light on the south jetty. The light was originally built with a Daboll trumpet for its foghorn, which was used as the light's fog signal for several years. However, at certain times due to specific weather conditions, the sound of the trumpet would fail at sea, and in 1910 the trumpet was replaced by a more reliable fog siren. While mariners liked the new signal, many Bandon residents did not. The siren would eventually be removed along with the Fresnel lens after the light's decommissioning. Over the next 37 years, the condition of the light deteriorated due to neglect and vandalism, until 1976, when its first major restoration began. However, by this time, the keepers quarters and other outbuildings had deteriorated past the point of repair, and were eventually removed. In 1991, a new solar powered light was installed in the tower. Currently, a new set of renovations are being done to the light as an ongoing project, and is estimated to finish sometime in 2011.

As a professional, he is best remembered as the recipient of a Walter Payton playoff touchdown and a victim of a pileup in a bench clearing brawl. He is the father of Drake Dunsmore. Early life At Ankeny, he competed in basketball until his senior year, when he became a football player and earned a football scholarship. At Drake, he was a highly regarded tight end, after converting from wide receiver as a senior, who slipped to the 106th pick in the 1983 NFL Draft after suffering a knee injury while skiing in early 1983. On September 13, 1980 he had 142 yards and six receptions for two touchdowns against Ball State. Dunsmore, was part of a historic era for Drake Bulldogs football including the nearly undefeated 1981 Drake Bulldogs football team. The team's 7-0 start was the school's first in 37 years, which caused Sports Illustrated to do a feature on the team.
