He taught himself to play the piano at age 10 and studied with the New Orleans jazz pianist Joseph Louis \\"Red\\" Cayou. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was a leading player for dance bands and Dixieland bands in New Orleans. His style blended elements of ragtime, jazz, blues, and boogie-woogie. After World War II, Washington joined Smiley Lewis in a trio with drummer Herman Seals. They released several popular songs for Imperial, including \\"Tee-Nah-Nah\\", \\"The Bells Are Ringing\\", and \\"Dirty People\\". Washington moved to St. Louis to play with Tab Smith. He returned to New Orleans in the 1960s, performing in restaurants in the French Quarter in clubs such as Tipitina's and at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. For years he had a regular engagement playing piano at a bar in the Pontchartrain Hotel. He avoided recording for most of his career, but he released the solo piano album New Orleans Piano Professor for Rounder in 1983. A live recording by Washington, Live at Tipitina's '78, was released by Night Train International Records in 1998.

The 24 km long high valley near W√∂rgl is one of the district's tourist centers. Besides a few hamlets, the municipality consists of the four church villages Niederau, Oberau, Auffach and Thierbach and is situated in the Kitzb√ºhel Alps. The municipal office is located in Oberau. Besides two tourist seasons, the intense highland agriculture plays an economic role. A lot of inhabitants commute to their place of work in other municipalities. The municipality Wildsch√∂nau is based on \\"gentle\\" tourism and emphasizes not being a ski circuit like the nearby Kitzb√ºhel. Several older T-bar lifts in the skiing region of Schatzberg (Auffach) were replaced with two chair lifts. A lift connection with the Alpbach valley was built in Summer 2012. For a long time, there was mining in the Wildsch√∂nau. Neighbouring municipalities Position within Tyrol Alpbach, Brixlegg, Hopfgarten im Brixental, Kundl, W√∂rgl. Boundaries The western border of the valley is formed by the following mountains (listed from north to south): Gratlspitz, Schatzberg, Joelspitze, L√§mpersberg, Kleiner Beil, Gro√üer Beil (the highest mountain in the valley), and Sonnjoch. In the east there are the: Ro√ükopf, Feldalphorn, Schwaiberghorn, Breiteggern, and Breiteggspitze (listed from north to south). In the north, the valley is separated from the Inntal by a much lower mountain chain, which is cleft by the Kundler Klamm, above which is the Kragenjoch. At the end of the valley is a rather flat pass, the Schafsiedeljoch. History The first mention of Wildsch√∂nau dates back to 1193‚Äì95, when the Bavarian count Henry of Lechsgem√ºnd-Rettenberg transferred some of his people to the Herrenchiemsee cloister. Among the testimonies of the deed issued in that circumstance was the ministerialis ¬´Adelbertus de Wiltsconen≈èwe¬ª (Albert of Wildsch√∂nau).Martin Bitschnau, Hannes Obermair (eds).

Coat of arms Legend has it that the high valley was originally covered by a lake, with a dragon living on its shores. A farmer killed the dragon and during its death struggle, it smashed the rocks which retained the lake. The water poured down through the resulting flume, the so-called Kundler Klamm, towards the Inn valley and the high valley was released. The coat of arms depicts the legendary dragon, while cleaving the rock.

It reaches a height of at its highest point, Ceann Garbh. It is part of the parish of Kildalton on Islay. The distilleries of Laphroaig and Lagavulin are nearby on the Islay coast, as well as Port Ellen. It is currently uninhabited, but is home to wild goats, as well as otters. Ceann Garbh, the summit of the island.__TOC__ Geology The island has its own fresh water supply at Tobar Moireig. The rock is mainly schist and some hornblende. History=Church history Texa has tentatively been identified as the Oidecha Insula written about by St Adomnan. The etymology of the name is disputed ‚Äì it may represent either the Old Irish tech (house ‚Äì taigh in modern Scottish Gaelic) or Oideachd/Oideachas, a word for a religious seminary. Adomnan mentions that St Cainneach (Kenneth) used \\"Oidecha Insula\\" as a stopping place on his journey between Iona and Ireland. Kenneth is said to have left his crozier on Iona on this journey, so St Columba blessed it, cast it into the sea, and it washed up on Oidecha where Kenneth found it. Whether or not Texa is Oidecha Insula, the island was, like many others round the Scottish coast, used as an ecclesiastical settlement, and the remains of a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary can still be seen. This was built, probably on the site of an older one, in the late 14th century by Raghnall/Reginald of Islay, son of Iain/John. This is commemorated today in the name B√†gh na h-Eaglais (Church Bay) and Tobar Moireig ([sic] Mary‚Äôs Well), which lies next to the anchorage. There are also many caves on the island, in which anchorites could live. The shaft of a cross stood east of the chapel, commemorating Raghnall. It is now in a museum in Edinburgh.National Museum of Scotland Record Miscellaneous Blaeu's 1654 Atlas with \\"Ylen Teghza\\" near the top. The map is oriented with west at the top. In the 13th Century, the Norse fleet of Somerled anchored near to Texa. Islay was one of the centres of Norse culture in the Hebrides. The island's name has been recorded in a number of variants. In 1385, John of Fordun refers to Texa as \\"Helan ttexa\\" (\\"eilean\\" being an island in Gaelic). In 1549, Dean Monro wrote of \\"Tisgay\\" that it was: \\"callit by the Erische Tisgay, ane myle of lenthe guid maineland, and ane kirk in it; very guid it is for sheep and for fishing.\\"Monro (1549) \\"Tisgay\\" no. 65 In 1614, it was referred to in a document as \\"Ilantasson\\", and was chartered by the crown to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor, confirmed by a Scottish Act of Parliament in 1626. In 1608, Andrew Knox, bishop of the Isles, wrote from \\"Ilintexa\\". In 1625, Father Cornelius Ward, a Franciscan missionary reported that there were twenty nine people living on the island, and most of them were Roman Catholic. (The island was inhabited until the early 19th century.) The six who were not Catholic, he converted. Johan Blaeu's 1654 Atlas records Texa as \\"Ylen Teghza\\".

The Gangsta Walk is commonly performed to crunk music due to the particular 'bounce' in the beat and the movement the dancers make to keep with it. Though Gangsta Walking has been around for many years, much of the dance is still exclusive to the city and surrounding areas. Gangsta Walk was created in Memphis. Originated by the group G-Style who released the first Gangsta Walk video ever titled ‚ÄúG-Style Gangsta\\" that consisted of Romeo, Wolf, and Hurricane, who went on to land a production deal with Dallas Austin behind the groups Boyz II Men, Monica, Another Bad Creation and TLC to name a few. They went on to land a major record deal with P. Diddy's Bad Boy entertainment and the first group to launch Bad Boy South. From the group success and their early video release from the song G-Style ‚ÄùGangsta\\". Doors opened and gave opportunity for other dances in Memphis Tennessee such as Jookin, Buckin, etc. and have spread abroad. The group continues to be a major part on the Memphis music scene with Romeo's latest business venture Romeo Franklin Productions that focus on training dancers, choreography and video and music productions. This unsung group as quiet as kept has been one of the major forces in getting Memphis music on the map. Development Due to video streaming websites like YouTube and social networks like myspace.com and others, \\"gangsta walking\\", \\"jookin\\", \\"choppin\\", \\"buckin\\" or whatever it may be called, has spread in popularity. In 2007, Memphis rapper‚Äìdirector‚Äìproducer Young Jai, of Jai Productions / Black Star Enterprisers, released Memphis Jookin Vol 1 DVD.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0B343DA3B7F543C3 This DVD featured the new generation of jookers/Gangsta Walkers. It featured such Jookers as G-Nerd, Mike Doss, Chopper king, Lil Daniel, Dr. Rico, Brandon Lil Buck, Lil Black, Bobo, female Jooker/Singer LaShuante Anderson, Underground King Keviorr, DJ Sidewalker, North Memphis Legend Lil Jayson and many others. This DVD helped springboard the Jookin/Gangsta Walking movement. In November 2007, Jookin was featured on Channel 3 WREG-TV news in Memphis and also on Channel 5 WMC-TV. There are several videos on Jookin on memphisjookin.com memphisjookin.com and Youtube.com, with some videos receiving millions of views. Jai Productions and The Memphis Jookin community was also featured in the December 2007 issue of the French magazine Juste Debout as the Dance of the Month.\\"Jookin' is tough to master, but it is catching the world's attention\\" (Aug 23, 2008) The Commercial Appeal, Memphis Jai productions also released a solo Jookin DVD on G-Nerd entitled \\"Truth Be Told\\" and Tutorial entitled \\"Memphis Jookin wit G-Nerd\\". Jai Productions has also released the entire Memphis Jookin Vol 2. 3-part series, which showcases more of the Jookin community that is involved in the movement to help get this dance on the map. Nowadays our youth have somewhere to go and learn the Memphis style. Memphian Tarrik Moore And Marico Flake (Dr Rico) originally opened U-Dig Jookin Academy in the once Raleigh Springs Mall, but have since renamed to Memphis Jookin Urban Ballet after the mall was closed. Perception of Gangsta Walking Along with being a popular street dance, the Gangsta Walk is often viewed as a form of self-expression and relief from the hardships of living within the inner city. Some have even considered Gangsta Walking as being a less extreme kin of Krumping due to it steering many of the youth away from street violence and exacting their energy into something positive and constructive. The dance can commonly be found in urban areas of Memphis like North Memphis, South Memphis, Orange Mound, Whitehaven, West Memphis etc. Types of Gangsta Walk There are variations of styles for the Gangsta Walk: * One particular style requires the dancer to take (in a jerking motion) quick steps, stomp, twists and throwing their arms around all while moving to a beat, the best example being Crunchy Black's style, referred to as G-Walking.MemphisRap.com The style is considered the basis of all Gangsta Walking done in Memphis since the 1980s. * Another style requires three or more people hopping around in a circle in a rhythmic motion, while throwing their hands into the air and yelling \\"Get Buck\\" or the lyrics to a Buck song. This style of the Gangsta Walk is more commonly referred to as the G-Train. It is said that this style was banned from the clubs shortly after being created due to the wildness it invoked in performers as well as onlookers. Reminders of its existence are still left behind in older clubs or closed down night spots around the city.Beer and Rap * The most known style of Gangsta Walking is within the standard crunk atmosphere, involving a crowd of people slamming and pushing off one another on the dance floor. * The most famous and practiced style of Gangsta Walking around the city takes bits and pieces from other street dance styles like liquid dancing (the wave, tutting, tracing, contours and hand flowing), the robot, locking, popping, gliding and even breakdancing all merged with the traditional dance. The most recognizable moves in the dance are moves similar to the two-step between making another motion and spinning or walking on the tips of their toes. This style of the Gangsta Walk is mostly done by the younger generation and the generation behind them who grew up shortly after the invention of Buck music, thus titling it Buckin. * Jookin took the classic steps and combined a much smoother look caused by the music change in Memphis Music during the early 1990s. Jookin is most noted for not only its smooth steps, but its heavy introduction of pantomiming into the dance styles. Jookin emphasized footwork in a way that focused the crowds attention on the feet. Jookin is especially characterized by the dancers' abilities in sliding and stepping movements. * Buckin brought in the exaggerated movements of Gangsta Walking and Jookin. The movements were made to appear more expansive due to the buckness (exaggerated style) of the dancer ‚Äì the most explosive style of Gangsta Walking. Buckers began to lift the slide (of the feet) off the ground, creating even higher glides than ever seen before. * Choppin' came in the mid 1990s as dancers in Memphis started to add the animated effect of Gangsta Walking, Jookin, and Buckin to the dance floor. Choppin' consisted of stiffening the muscles until they began to vibrate and then moving while trying to create a very unreal stiff Gangsta Walk. * Icin', the newest form of Gansta Walking, is most known for the ability to slide with one foot while gliding with the other. Icers give the illusions of ice skating through the explosiveness of the movements they applied while gliding across the floor. Some nickname it \\"Blazing.\\" Icin' also included different ways of freezing the body parts while carrying oneself around the floor. * Basics of all the styles include stepping, pacmans,\\"How to Do the PacMan arm wave dance move\\" (2010) WonderHowTo and buck jumps.\\"Dance Sensation Lil Buck Teaches Us How to 'Buck Jump (June 29, 2014) genConnect Music videos  * Al Kapone - \\"Buckin' and Jookin * Three 6 Mafia feat.Chamillionaire - \\"Doe Boy Fresh\\" * Three 6 Mafia feat.

They are based in the Boherbee and Camp area of Tralee. They play in Division 1 of the county league and in the Kerry Senior Football Championship. Club history Before 1927 only one team represented Tralee in the Kerry Senior Football County Championship and they were Tralee John Mitchels. As this team was so successful the Kerry County Board requested that it should be divided into three individual teams representing, Boherbee, Rock St. and Strand St, this is where the John Mitchels, Austin Stacks and Kerins O'Rahilly's clubs came from. The John Mitchels club since 1927 are thought to be one of the most successful clubs in Kerry. Between 1959 and 1963 they won five Senior Football titles in a row, the only team to do so in the history of the Kerry County Championship. John Mitchels Club are holders of 10 Senior, 1 U-21 and 3 Minor County Championships. They have also played in 3 Kerry Senior Club Hurling Championship finals in 1927 and 1928 losing both to Austin Stacks and 1936 they lost to St. Brendan's, Ardfert. Success has been limited of late, although John Mitchels player Brien Costello, captained Tralee CBS to Munster Colleges Senior 'A' Corn U√≠ Mhuir√≠ Glory and in the All-Ireland Colleges Hogan Cup Final loss to Omagh CBS in 2007. In 2008 for the first time in the club's long history they dropped out of the Senior County Championship to the Kerry Intermediate Football Championship.

It lies adjacent to Green Street and Upton Park tube station. The street market originated in Green Street at the boundary between East Ham and West Ham in the late Victorian era when the new suburb of East Ham began to be developed. Originally the stall holders were Jewish traders from Whitechapel and the East End, selling clothing and vegetables. The traders were pushed into Queens Road in 1904 to stop them obstructing the main road and to allow for the passage of trams. It was not until 1925 that the borough obtained statutory powers to regulate street markets.

The market is open 7 days a week as it has started a Sunday Market though it is not currently popular. In November 2006, in the face of a vigorous local campaign of opposition, Newham Council proposed a redevelopment of the existing market site which was to include a supermarket and luxury housing above a much smaller covered market.Newham Regeneration project accessed 25 Apr 2007 Following the local campaign, in May 2009 then Mayor of London Boris Johnson directed Newham Council to refuse planning permission to redevelop the market. A notable trader at the Queen's is Muhammad Shahid Nazir, more commonly known as the '¬£1 Fish Man'. He rose to fame as a fish trader at the Queen's Market through his composition of a market trader's song. It became a viral hit through shoppers at the Queen's Market recording him and uploading to YouTube. It has also given Nazir a record deal, with his single released on 7 December 2012.

The word is derived from popor, meaning \\"people\\" in Romanian. Founded by Constantin Stere in the early 1890s, Poporanism is distinguished by its opposition to socialism, promotion of voting rights for all and its intent to reform the Parliament and the farming system. Regarding Romania's agrarian situation, Poporanists wished to form co-operative farms for the peasants and to remove them from aristocratic control. Unlike Junimism, another popular political philosophy, Poporanism focused mainly on expanding the power of the peasants. In a very nationalist manner, it was also a champion of the Romanian language and of maintaining the Romanian spirit. Several famous Romanians, including Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, supported it. Narodism and Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a Romanian political activist, first introduced the Russian ideas of Narodism to Romania and supported the ideas of Poporanism. The fundamental philosophy of Narodism had a lasting impact on Poporanism, spurring its rejection of capitalism and of Marxist ideas. However, unlike Narodists, Stere did not believe that a revolution was necessary in Romania. Later, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Stere had a split of political philosophy in regards to anti-Semitism and liberalism, and Dobrogeanu-Gherea formed the Social-Democratic Worker‚Äôs Party, and Poporanists joined the National Liberal Party.

Fettes College, Edinburgh Sir William Fettes, 1st Baronet (; 25 June 1750 - 27 May 1836) was a wealthy Scottish businessman and philanthropist, who left a bequest which led to the foundation of Fettes College, in Edinburgh. Life The Fettes family came from north east Scotland, where the name can be encountered in such variants as \\"Vettese\\" (cf. the Scottish writer Raymond Vettese), \\"Fittes\\" and \\"Fiddes\\". Fettes was born on 25 June 1750, the eldest son of Margaret, daughter of James Rae, and William Fettes, an Edinburgh merchant. At the age of 8 he attended the Royal High School in Edinburgh. When he was 18 years old he commenced his business life, trading in wine and tea from premises in the High Street. In 1787 he married Maria Malcolm and in 1788 their only son, William Fettes (1788-1815) was born. His life covered a period of economic expansion in Scotland and, at the commencement of the Napoleonic Wars, he was ideally placed to establish connections with Durham, Leeds and Newcastle becoming an underwriter, a military contractor and, in 1800, a director of the British Linen Bank. A merchant, and underwriter, Fettes lived not far from Fettes College present location on Comely Bank, in the Stockbridge district of Edinburgh. He had made his money trading tea during the Napoleonic wars, and used this to buy the estate of Comely Bank.Scottish Gazetteer He was by then living at Comely Bank in the Stockbridge district of Edinburgh and he had other estates which he had bought but he was to retire from trade in 1800 to look after these interests. He was involved in many public charities and the general welfare of Edinburgh, serving as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1804 to 1806 (two elected sessions). He became a baronet of Whamphrey in the County of Dumfires on 13 June 1804. In 1815, his only son, William Fettes died at the age of 27 of typhoid in Berlin, while on a tour of Europe, . He had been admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1810 five years previously. Without an heir, Fettes was to live on to May 1836, predeceasing his wife by just three weeks. They are buried together in Canongate Kirkyard on the Royal Mile. In later life Fettes lived at 13 Charlotte Square and this is where he died. Fettes had originally intended that money from his estate should pay for a hospital rather than a school but he later decided to make it a school for orphans and the needy. In his will he made a bequest which was to lead to the foundation of Fettes College. The Fettes Bequest His bequest, of ¬£166,000, in memory of his only son, was for the endowment of a school for orphaned or needy children, a tradition it still continues through the Fettes Foundation's scholarship and bursary programmes. Fettes' Mausoleum in the Canongate Kirkyard, Edinburgh His will declares: > \\"It is my intention that the residue of my whole estate should form an > endowment for the maintenance, education and outfit of young people whose > parents have either died without leaving sufficient funds for that purpose, > or who from innocent misfortune during their lives, are unable to give > suitable education to their children.\\" After his death the bequest was effected and invested. His Trustees allowed the investments to accumulate for more than 25 years before they decided that with ¬£166,000, there was enough capital with which to acquire the land, to found the school, and to fund scholarships. The main school building was designed by David Bryce, nearly 20 years after Fettes‚Äô death, and it opened in 1870, 34 years after his death. Fettes College thus opened with 53 pupils (40 were Foundation Scholars with 11 others boarding and two day pupils). By 1875 200 boys enrolled.

His assistant editor and lodger Mary Ann Evans later wrote classic novels under the name George Eliot. Life He was born on 16 June 1821. He was son of a chemist at Nottingham. He was apprenticed to a watchmaker at Worksop, but, not staying long with him, went to his brother, a medical student at Edinburgh, who sent him out to Adelaide to start in business as a watchmaker and optician. Returning to Europe about 1844, he began studying medicine in Paris, and continued his studies at St. George's Hospital, London. After submitting a book on human nature to Green, a publisher and bookseller in Newgate Street, he was led to take over Green's business, which he transferred to 142 Strand. In 1846, he published the first English translation of David Strauss' Life of Jesus, translated by Mary Ann Evans, later better known by her pen name of George Eliot. Seven years later he published her translation of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity. He acquired the philosophical radical journal the Westminster Review in 1851, and provided a platform for emerging ideas of evolution. His assistant Mary Anne Evans brought together authors including Francis William Newman, W. R. Greg, Harriet Martineau and the young journalist Herbert Spencer, and later John Stuart Mill, William Carpenter, Robert Chambers, George Holyoake and Thomas Huxley. Herbert Spencer \\"despaired of getting his sociological writings published until Chapman took him on. (It was he, not Darwin, who coined the phrase \\"the survival of the fittest\\".) Thomas Huxley, later famous as the most ardent supporter of Darwinism, calling himself Darwin's bulldog and cheerfully going into battle with bishops over On the Origin of Species while Darwin lay low at his home in Kent, was plucked from poverty and obscurity by Chapman. His first paid employment was as scientific reviewer on the Westminster Review, the radical quarterly periodical that Chapman bought in 1851 and turned into the best journal of the century.\\" Rosemary Ashton, The Smart Set, The Guardian, 4 November 2006 Chapman subsequently became a qualified specialist in sickness and psychological medicine, and in 1865 Charles Darwin invited Dr. Chapman to Downe and gave him a long list of the symptoms he had suffered from for 25 years. Chapman prescribed a spinal freezing treatment.Adrian Desmond and James Moore, Darwin (London: Michael Joseph, the Penguin Group, 1991). In 19th- century Britain there was high-class patronage of Hydropathy.

Chapman was proprietor and editor of the Westminster Review, to which Huxley had been a regular contributor.\\"The Darwin project For his woes, Chapman had Darwin using bags of ice applied to the spine.

Biography  Boebinger was born June 29, 1959 in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of four sons of a minister and an elementary-school teacher. He is a 1977 graduate of North Central High School in Indianapolis. He married his high-school sweetheart; they have three children. He simultaneously earned three bachelor's degrees - in physics, philosophy and electrical engineering - from Purdue University in 1981. With a Churchill Scholarship, he traveled to the Cambridge University for one year of research under Professor Sir Richard Friend, studying the temperature dependent structural changes in one-dimensional organic superconductors. His 1986 doctorate in physics came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, he held Compton and Hertz Foundation fellowships. His work involved experiments with high-powered magnets at the MIT Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, and it was there he became a graduate assistant for two scientists who would later win the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics: Horst Ludwig St√∂rmer, then of Bell Laboratories, and Daniel Tsui, then a professor at Princeton University. His thesis research utilized high magnetic fields and ultra-low temperatures to study fractional quantum Hall effect. He spent a year as a NATO Postdoctoral Fellow in Paris at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure studying other quantum behaviors of electrons in quantum wells. In 1987, Boebinger joined the research staff at Bell Laboratories and established a unique pulsed magnetic field facility for physics research on semiconductors, f-electron compounds and superconductors in magnetic fields up to 60 tesla. For this research, he was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1996. In 1998, Boebinger became head of the Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory, one of the three campuses of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. There he continued his research on high-temperature superconductors, using the intense pulsed magnetic fields to suppress superconductivity. He also did a stint as deputy director for Science Programs in the Division of Material Science and Technology. In 2004, he moved to Florida State University to become director of the Magnet Lab, with responsibility for the lab's programs at all three campuses: Florida State University, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the University of Florida. His research continues to focus on high-temperature superconductivity and he maintains laboratories and close collaborations with colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He has lobbied the scientific community to build a unique, world-class laser - dubbed Big Light - at the Magnet Lab. The free- electron laser would span the terahertz-to-visible-light part of the electromagnetic spectrum, probing a blind spot that scientists have yet to fully explore. The 4th-generation light source would be housed in a separate, specially-built facility beside the Mag Lab.National Science Foundation document  Honors and awards  Fellow of: * American Association for the Advancement of Science * American Physical Society * Fannie and John Hertz Foundation (MIT) * Karl Taylor Compton Foundation (MIT) * Winston Churchill Foundation * NATO Postdoctoral Fellowship (√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure) * Distinguished Science Alumnus: Purdue University School of Science ReferencesExternal links * Magnet Lab Profile * FSU Profile Category:21st-century American physicists Boebinger, Gregory S.

He was the son of Tartu and great-grandson of Batu Khan. He assumed the throne in the Golden Horde in 1287 with the help of Nogai Khan, but was dethroned four years later by the same, replaced by Tokhta.  Military career = European campaigns  He accompanied the Mongol invasion of Lithuania with Nogai under the command of Burundai in 1259. Alongside Nogai Khan, he led the second Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1284-1285 and the third Mongol raid against Poland in 1287. Despite initial success most of the attacks were unsuccessful. As a matter of rule, the Galician and Rus' dukes were ordered to accompany the Mongol raid on Hungary together with Tulabuga and Nogai in 1285. Although Nogai and his Tatars plundered villages and some cities, they were beaten back by the Hungarian royal army and Vlachs upon their return. For Tulabuga, his army had strayed in the Carpathian Mountains and lost many of their horses due to cold weather. Soon after that, Nogai made him the Khan of Ulus of Jochi and overthrew the previous khan. Tulabuga shared his authority with his brother and cousins who were the sons of Mongke Temur Khan. Their next raid clearly showed disagreements and tensions among them. In 1286 Khan Tulabuga decided to organize the raid on Poland, together with Khan Nogai. For this purpose, Khan Tulabuga arrived with his armies to Nogai's headquarters, but there was \\"a great disagreement between them.\\" In the end, Khan Tulabuga moved against Poland by himself. Tulabuga left part of his troops in Volodymyr, then the capital of Galicia-Volhynia, and moved against Poland together with his Rus' regiments. Note that the Tatar-Mongols had plundered the Volhynian lands during that time. Tatar and Rus' troops had advanced towards Cracow through Sandomierz and Zawichost. The Mongols afterwards had returned with 20,000 Polish captives. In 1287, Khan Tulabuga raided Poland one last time. This time he was joined by Alguy, the son of Mengu-Timur. Upon their return, Tulabuga was accompanied by both Dukes Leo and Mstislav to Lviv. At this point, Duke Vladimir, in the presence of Tulabuga and Alguy, decided to pass his throne on to Mstislav, the son of Danylo. Duke Leo attempted to prevent this from happening, by calling into mind the existence of \\"his friend\\" Khan Nogai. Duke Mstislav then forced him to withdraw, explaining that the power transfer was already made and agreed upon by the rulers of the Golden Horde and their counselors. It was a frightening prospect to make complains to the Golden Horde. In 1290, Khan Tulabuga and Nogai had attacked the land of Zichia (probably Circassia). The weather turned out to be terribly cold. Nogai left him and returned to his lands. Khan Tulabuga lost all of his companions and troops except his chief khatun. Tulabuga had suspected that Nogai was behind his failure.  Wars against the Ilkhanate  Tulabuga was primarily focused on Europe. During his reign, the Jochid army invaded the Ilkhanate through the Caucasus mountains in 1288 and 1290. Both of these attempts were repelled by the Ilkhan Arghun. All these actions made his reputation inglorious among the Mongol nobles. Even so, Tulabuga never sent envoys to Egypt to encourage the Mamluks to fight against his relatives in the Ilkhanate.  Death  Control of the Rus' principalities was divided among Khan Tulabuga and Nogai. Nogai had exercised de facto control over the North-Western part of the Rus' lands, while the North-Eastern Rus' lands had sided with Tulabuga. Tulabuga was obviously not satisfied with such a division of his empire. Nogai had asked for a meeting with the Khan with other Chingisids. Tulabuga, who came without his bodyguards, was fooled into an ambush and arrested. Nogai then had Tulabuga executed by Tokhta in 1290/1291.

On October 6, 2010, the Dallas Independent School District announced that Bryan Adams would be reorganized after receiving the state's lowest rating for two straight years. The reorganization would take place for the 2011-2012 school year in a process known as \\"reconstitution,\\" according to DISD spokesman Jon Dahlander. State law requires the academic shakeup for campuses that consistently are rated \\"academically unacceptable.\\" Campus review teams at the schools, consisting of an internal and external member, will review students' performance on the state exam to determine which teachers should leave the schools, Dahlander said. Bryan Adams high school is on the low-performing list for its graduation rate, he said. In 2015, DISD started a school of choice program for many schools in Dallas and Bryan Adams will begin to phase in a school-wide leadership model in a three- to five-year plan. Bryan Adams is among seven Dallas ISD choice schools that are planned to launch in the next couple of years. Unlike magnet schools, choice schools will not have any academic entry requirements.

Often, a leader who is not actively studying the material will direct group activities. Some colleges actively set up study group programs for students to sign up. Typical college level academic groups include 5-20 students and an administrator or tutor drawn from the graduate program or a senior student or a faculty. Professional groups are often smaller. When students study in groups, they can motivate and encourage each other and lessen procrastination. Also, students are able to learn some studying skills and habits by observing others' study skills and they can incorporate it in their studying routine. Teaching concepts and information to others can help be more familiar and master those concepts. In addition, some students might be uncomfortable asking a question in class and they might feel more comfortable asking someone in a small group.

It originated in the northern regions of Cuba, mainly in urban Havana and Matanzas, during the late 19th century. It is based on African music and dance traditions, namely Abaku√° and yuka, as well as the Spanish-based coros de clave. According to Argeliers Le√≥n, rumba is one of the major \\"genre complexes\\" of Cuban music, and the term rumba complex is now commonly used by musicologists. This complex encompasses the three traditional forms of rumba (yamb√∫, guaguanc√≥ and columbia), as well as their contemporary derivatives and other minor styles. Traditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets and solares (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba's most characteristic forms of music and dance. Vocal improvisation, elaborate dancing and polyrhythmic drumming are the key components of all rumba styles. Cajones (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century, when they were replaced by tumbadoras (conga drums). During the genre's recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas, Clave y Guaguanc√≥, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo. Since its early days, the genre's popularity has been largely confined to Cuba, although its legacy has reached well beyond the island. In the United States it gave its name to the so-called \\"ballroom rumba\\" or rhumba, and in Africa soukous is commonly referred to as \\"Congolese rumba\\" (despite being actually based on son cubano). Its influence in Spain is testified by rumba flamenca and derivatives such as Catalan rumba.  Etymology  The origin of the term rumba remains unknown and no etymological information is provided by the Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola. According to Joan Corominas, the word derives from \\"rumbo\\", meaning \\"uproar\\" (and previously \\"pomp\\") and also \\"the course of a ship\\", which itself may derive from the word \\"rombo\\" (\\"rhombus\\"), a symbol used in compasses. In the 1978 documentary La rumba, directed by √ìscar Vald√©s, it is stated that the term rumba originated in Spain to denote \\"all that is held as frivolous\\", deriving from the term \\"mujeres de rumbo\\". Alternatively, in Cuba the term might have originated from a West African or Bantu language, due to its similarity to other Afro-Caribbean words such as tumba, macumba, mambo and tamb√≥. During the 19th century in Cuba, specifically in urban Havana and Matanzas, people of African descent originally used the word rumba as a synonym for party. According to Olavo Al√©n, in these areas \\"[over time] rumba ceased to be simply another word for party and took on the meaning both of a defined Cuban musical genre and also of a very specific form of dance.\\"Al√©n Rodr√≠guez, Olavo (2002). \\"A History of the Congas\\" AfroCuba Web. p. 3. The terms rumb√≥n and rumbantela (the latter of Galician or Portuguese origin) are frequently used to denote rumba performances in the streets. Many other terms have been used in Cuba to refer to parties, such as chang√º√≠ (in Oriente), guateque (in rural regions), tumba (by Afro-Cubans), bemb√© (associated with Santer√≠a), macumba and mambo. Due to its broad etymology, the term rumba historically retained a certain degree of polysemy. By the end of the 19th century, Cuban peasants (guajiros) began to perform rumbitas during their parties (guateques, chang√º√≠s, parrandas and fiestas patronales). These songs were actually in the form of urban guarachas (not proper rumbas), which had a binary meter in contrast to the ternary meter of traditional rural genres such as tonada and zapateo. Similarly, in Cuban bufo theatre at the beginning of the 20th century, the guarachas that were sung at the end of the show were referred to as rumba final despite not sharing any musical similarities with actual rumba. Characteristics=Instrumentation Rumba instrumentation has varied historically depending on the style and the availability of the instruments. The core instruments of any rumba ensemble are the claves, two hard wooden sticks that are struck against each other, and the conga drums: quinto (lead drum, highest-pitched), tres dos (middle-pitched), and tumba or salidor (lowest-pitched). Other common instruments include the cat√° or guagua, a wooden cylinder; the palitos, wooden sticks to strike the cat√°; shakers such as the cheker√© and the maracas; scraper percussion instruments such as the g√ºiro; bells, and cajones, wooden boxes that preceded the congas. During the 1940s, the genre experienced a mutual influence with son cubano, especially by Ignacio Pi√±eiro's Septeto Nacional and Arsenio Rodr√≠guez's conjunto, which led to the incorporation of instruments such as the tres, the double bass, the trumpet and the piano, and the removal of idiophone instruments. At the same time, Cuban big bands, in collaboration with musical artists such as Chano Pozo, began to include authentic rumbas among their dance pieces. The group AfroCuba de Matanzas, founded in 1957, added bat√° drums to the traditional rumba ensemble in their style, known as bat√°-rumba. More recently, a cappella (vocals-only, without instruments) rumba has been performed by the Cuban ensemble Vocal Sampling, as heard in their song \\"Conga Yambumba\\". Rhythm Rumba clave in duple-pulse and triple-pulse structures Although rumba is played predominantly in binary meter (duple pulse: , ), triple meter (triple pulse: , ) is also present. In most rumba styles, such as yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥, duple pulse is primary and triple-pulse is secondary.Pe√±alosa, David (2011). Rumba Quinto. Redway, CA: Bembe Books. . p. xxii. In contrast, in the rural style columbia, triple pulse is the primary structure and duple pulse is secondary. This can be explained due to the \\"binarization\\" of African-based ternary rhythms. Both the claves and the quinto (lead drum) are responsible for establishing the rhythm. Subsequently, the other instruments play their parts supporting the lead drum. Rhythmically, rumba is based on the five- stroke guide pattern called clave and the inherent structure it conveys.Pe√±alosa, David (2009). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . pp. 185-187. Song structure Yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥ songs often begin with the soloist singing a melody with meaningless syllables, rather than with word-based lyrics. This introductory part is called the diana. According to Larry Crook, the diana is important because it \\"also contains the first choral refrain\\". The lead singer provides a melodic phrase or musical motive/theme for the choral sections, or they may present new but related material. Parallel harmonies are usually built above or below a melodic line, with \\"thirds, sixths, and octaves most common.\\" Therefore, the singer who is singing the diana initiates the beginning of the rumba experience for the audience. The singer then improvises lyrics stating the reason for holding and performing the present rumba. This kind of improvisation is called decimar, since it is done in d√©cimas, ten-line stanzas. Alternatively, the singer might sing an established song. Some of the most common and recognizable rumba standards are \\"Ave Maria Morena\\" (yamb√∫), \\"Llora como llor√©\\" (guaguanc√≥), \\"Cuba linda, Cuba hermosa\\" (guaguanc√≥), \\"China de oro (Laye Laye)\\" (columbia), and \\"A Malanga\\" (columbia). Rumba songs consist of two main sections. The first, the canto, features the lead vocalist, performing an extended text of verses that are sometimes partially improvised. The lead singer usually plays claves.Manuel, Peter. Caribbean currents. Chapter 2: \\"Cuba\\". Philadelphia: Temple U. Press. 1995. The first section may last a few minutes, until the lead vocalist signals for the other singers to repeat the short refrain of the chorus, in call and response. This second section of the song is sometimes referred to as the montuno. History=Syncretic origins Enslaved Africans were first brought in Cuba in the 16th century by the early Spanish settlers. Due to the significance of sugar as an export during the late 18th and early 19th century, even greater numbers of people from Africa were enslaved, brought to Cuba, and forced to work on the sugar plantations. Where large populations of enslaved Africans lived, African religion, dance, and drumming were clandestinely preserved through the generations. Cultural retention among the Bantu, Yoruba, Fon (Arar√°), and Efik (Abaku√°) had the most significant impact in western Cuba, where rumba was born. The consistent interaction of Africans and Europeans on the island brought about what today is known as Afro-Cuban culture. This is a process known as transculturation, an idea that Cuban scholar Fernando Ortiz brought to the forefront in cultural studies like Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar. Cuban transculturation melds Spanish culture with African cultures, as with the seamless merging found in rumba. Ortiz saw transculturation as a positive social force: \\"consecrating the need for mutual understanding on an objective grounding of truth to move toward achieving the definitive integrity of the nation.\\"Ortiz, Fernando (1993). \\"For a Cuban Integration of Whites and Blacks.\\" AfroCuba. Ed. Pedro Perez Sarduy & Jean Stubbs. New York, NY: Ocean Press. p. 31 Most ethnomusicologists agree that the roots of rumba can be found in the solares of Havana and Matanzas during the 1880s.Pe√±alosa (2011), p. xiii. The solares, also known as cuarter√≠as, were large houses in the poor dock neighborhoods of Havana and Matanzas. Many of the important figures in the history of rumba, from Malanga to Mongo Santamar√≠a were raised in solares. Slavery was abolished in 1886 and first- generation of free black citizens were often called negros de naci√≥n, a term commonly found in the lyrics of rumba songs. The earliest progenitors of the urban styles of rumba (yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥) might have developed during the early 19th century in slave barracks (barracones) long before the use of the term rumba as a genre became established. Such proto-rumba styles were probably instrumented with household items such as boxes and drawers instead of the congas, and frying pans, spoons and sticks instead of guaguas, palitos and claves. While these early precursors of rumba have been barely documented, the direct precursors towards the mid- and late-19th century have been widely studied. Urban rumba styles are rooted in the so-called coros de clave and coros de guaguanc√≥, street choirs that derived from the Spanish orfeones. In addition, the widespread yuka dance and music of Congolese origin became integrated into such choirs, lending its percussion instruments and dance moves. In addition, the secret Abaku√° traditions rooted in the Calabar region of West Africa that prevailed in both Havana and Matanzas also influenced the development of rumba as a syncretic genre. Coros de clave Coros de clave were introduced by Catalan composer Jos√© Anselmo Clav√© and became popular between the 1880s and the 1910s. They comprised as many as 150 men and women who sang in time with European harmonies and instruments. Songs began with a female solo singer followed by call-and-response choral singing. As many as 60 coros de clave might have existed by 1902, some of which denied any African influence on their music. Examples of popular coros de clave include El Arpa de Oro and La Juventud. From the coros the clave evolved the coros de guaguanc√≥, which comprised mostly men, had a time, and incorporated drums. Famous coros de guaguanc√≥ include El Timbre de Oro, Los Roncos (both featuring Ignacio Pi√±eiro, the latter as director), and Paso Franco. These ensembles gave rise to the first authentic rumba groups, and with them several types of rumba emerged, including the now popular guaguanc√≥ and yamb√∫. However, others have been lost to time or are extremely rare today, such as the tahona, papalote, tonada,Sacred Rhythms (Regino Jim√©nez and Ilu A√±a) Bembe CD 2027-2 (2001). and the jiribilla and resed√°. Early recognition and recordings Rumba served as an expression to those who were oppressed, thus beginning a social and racial identity with rumba. The synthesis of cultures can be seen in rumba because it \\"exhibits both continuity with older traditions and development of new ones. The rumba itself is a combination of music, dance, and poetry.\\" During slavery, and after it was abolished, rumba served as a social outlet for oppressed slaves and the underclass which was typically danced in the streets or backyards in urban areas. Rumba is believed to have grown out of the social circumstances of Havana because it \\"was the center for large numbers of enslaved Africans by the end of the eighteenth century. Rebellion was difficult and dangerous, but protest in a disguised form was often expressed in recreational music and dance.\\"Daniel (1995), p. 19 Even after slavery was abolished in Cuba, there still remained social and racial inequality, which Afro-Cubans dealt with by using rumba's music and dancing as an outlet of frustration. Because Afro-Cubans had fewer economic opportunities and the majority lived in poverty, the style of dance and music did not gain national popularity and recognition until the 1950s, and especially after the effects of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which institutionalized it. The first commercial studio recordings of Cuban rumba were made in 1947 in New York by Carlos Vidal Bolado and Chano Pozo for SMC Pro-Arte, and in 1948 in Havana by Filiberto S√°nchez for Panart. The first commercial ensemble recordings of rumba were made in the mid 1950s by Alberto Zayas and his Conjunto Afrocubano Lul√∫ Yonkori, yielding the 1956 hit \\"El vive bien\\". The success of this song prompted the promotion of another rumba group, Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas, which became extremely popular. Together with Los Mu√±equitos, Los Papines were the first band to popularize rumba in Cuba and abroad. Their very stylized version of the genre has been considered a \\"unique\\" and \\"innovative\\" approach. Post-revolutionary institutionalization After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, there were many efforts by the government to institutionalize rumba, which has resulted in two different types of performances. The first was the more traditional rumba performed in a backyard with a group of friends and family without any type of governmental involvement. The second was a style dedicated to tourists while performed in a theater setting. Two institutions that promoted rumba as part of Cuban culture ‚Äìthus creating the tourist performance‚Äì are the Ministry of Culture and the Conjunto Folkl√≥rico Nacional de Cuba ('Cuban Nacional Folkloric Company'). As Folkl√≥rico Nacional became more prevalent in the promotion of rumba, the dance \\"shifted from its original locus, street corners, where it often shared attention with parallel activities of traffic, business, and socializing, to its secondary quarters, the professional stage, to another home, the theatrical patio.\\"Daniel (1995), p. 59. Although Folkl√≥rico Nacional aided in the tourist promotion of rumba, the Ministry of Culture helped successfully and safely organize rumba in the streets. In early post-revolutionary times, spontaneous rumba might have been considered problematic due to its attraction of large groups at unpredictable and spontaneous times, which caused traffic congestion in certain areas and was linked with fights and drinking. The post-revolutionary government aimed to control this \\"by organizing where rumba could take place agreeable and successfully, the government, through the Ministry of Culture, moved to structurally safeguard one of its major dance/music complexes and incorporate it and Cuban artists nearer the core of official Cuban culture.\\"Daniel (1995), p. 61. This change in administering rumba not only helped organize the dances but also helped it move away from the negative connotation of being a disruptive past time event. Although this organization helped the style of rumba develop as an aspect of national culture, it also had some negative effects. For example, one of the main differences between pre- and post- revolutionary is that after the revolution rumba became more structured and less spontaneous. For instance, musicians dancers and singers gathered together to become inspired through rumba. In other words, rumba was a form of the moment where spontaneity was essentially the sole objective. However, post-revolutionary Cuba \\"led to manipulation of rumba form. It condensed the time of a rumba event to fit theater time and audience concentration tie. It also crystallized specific visual images through... [a] framed and packaged... dance form on stages and special performance patios.\\"Daniel (1995), p. 65. Yvonne Daniel states: ‚ÄúFolkl√≥rico Nacional dancers . . . must execute each dance as a separate historical entity in order to guard and protect the established representations of Cuban folkloric traditions . . . by virtue of their membership in the national company, the license to elaborate or create stylization . . . is not available to them.‚ÄùDaniel (1995), p. 100. As official caretakers of the national folkloric treasure, the Conjunto Folkl√≥rico Nacional has successfully preserved the sound of the mid-twentieth century Havana-style rumba.Pe√±alosa (2011), p. 236. True traditional or folkloric rumba is not as stylized as the theatrical presentations performed by professional rumba groups; rather, \\"[i]t is more of an atmosphere than a genre. It goes without saying that in Cuba there is not one rumba, but many rumbas.\\"Carpentier, Alejo and Alan West-Dur√°n (2000). Music in Cuba. Transition. 2000.82. p. 207. Despite the structure enforced in rumba through the Folkl√≥rico Nacional and the Ministry of Culture, traditional forms of rumba danced at informal social gatherings remain pervasive. Modernization In the 1980s, Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas greatly expanded the melodic parameters of the drums, inspiring a wave of creativity that ultimately led to the modernization of rumba drumming. Freed from the confines of the traditional drum melodies, rumba became more an aesthetic, rather than a specific combination of individual parts. The most significant innovation of the late 1980s was the rumba known as guarapachangueo, created by Los Chinitos of Havana, and bat√°-rumba, created by AfroCuba de Matanzas. Bat√°-rumba initially was just a matter of combining guaguanc√≥ and chachalokuaf√∫n, but it has since expanded to include a variety of bat√° rhythms. A review of the 2008 CD by Pedro Mart√≠nez and Rom√°n D√≠az, The Routes of Rumba, describes guarapachangueo as follows:*Reviewer(s): Johnny Fr√≠as * Review of: Mart√≠nez, Pedro, and Rom√°n D√≠az. 2oo8.

Pancho Quinto and his group Yoruba Andabo also played a vital role in the development of the genre. The word derives from \\"guarapachanga\\", itself a portmanteau of \\"guarapo\\" and \\"pachanga\\" coined by composer Juan Rivera Prevot in 1961. Legacy and influence Rumba is considered \\"the quintessential genre of Cuban secular music and dance\\". In 1985 the Cuban Minister of Culture stated that \\"rumba without Cuba is not rumba, and Cuba without rumba is not Cuba.\\"What‚Äôs Cuba Playing At? BBC documentary film (1985). For many Cubans, rumba represents \\"a whole way of life\\",Esteban \\"Chach√°\\" Vega Bacallao (2001). Roots of Rhythm. DVD. and professional rumberos have called it \\"a national sport, as important as baseball\\".Aguabella, Francisco (1999) Inter. J. Poet. ‚ÄúFrancisco Aguabella: Sworn to the Drum.‚Äù Drum Magazine Online. Web. The genre has permeated not only the culture of Cuba but also that of the whole of Latin America, including the United States, through its influence on genres such as ballroom rumba (\\"rhumba\\"), Afro-Cuban jazz and salsa. Even though rumba is technically complicated and usually performed by a certain social class and one \\"racial group\\", Cubans consider it one of the most important facets of their cultural identity. In fact, it is acknowledged as intimately and fundamentally \\"Cuban\\" by most Cubans because it rose from Cuban social dance. After its institutionalization following the Revolution, rumba has adopted a position as a symbol of what Cuba stands for and of how Cubans want the international community to envision their country and its culture and society: vibrant, full of joy and authentic. =Influence on other Afro-Cuban traditions= Rumba has influenced both the transplanted African drumming traditions and the popular dance music created on the island. In 1950, Fernando Ort√≠z observed the influence of rumba upon ceremonial bat√° drumming: \\"‚ÄúThe drummers are alarmed at the disorder that is spreading in the temples regarding the liturgical toques ['bat√° rhythms']. The people wish to have fun and ask for arrumbados, which are toques similar to rumbas and are not orthodox according to rites; the drummers who do not gratify the faithful, who are the ones that pay, are not called to play and if they do not play, they do not collect.‚ÄùOrt√≠z, Fernando (1950: 125) Los instrumentos de la m√∫sica folkl√≥rica de Cuba. tr. John Turpin III and B.E. Mart√≠nez 1980. Oakland, CA: the translators. The bat√° rhythms chachalokuafun and √±ongo in particular have absorbed rumba aesthetics. Michael Spiro states: ‚ÄúWhen I hear √±ongo played by young drummers today, I hear rumba.\\"Spiro quoted by Pe√±alosa (2011), p. 183. In chachalokuafun the high-pitched ok√≥nkolo drum, usually the most basic and repetitive bat√°, improvises independently of the conversations carried on between the other two drums (iy√° and it√≥tele), in a manner suggestive of rumba. The contemporary style of lead drum accompaniment for the cheker√© ensemble known as agbe or guiro, is played on the high-pitched quinto, instead of the lower-pitched tumba as was done in earlier times. The part has evolved away from the bemb√© caja (lead drum) vocabulary towards quinto-like phrases.Pe√±alosa (2011), p. 183. Rumba has had a notable influence on caj√≥n pa‚Äô los muertos ceremonies. In a rare turn of events, the secular yamb√∫ was adopted into this Afro-Cuban religion.Warden, Nolan (2006: 119) Caj√≥n Los Muertos: Transculturation and Emergent Tradition in Afro-Cuban Ritual Drumming and Song. M.A. Thesis, Tufts University. =Influence on contemporary music= Many of the rhythmic innovations in Cuban popular music, from the early twentieth century, until present, have been a matter of incorporating rumba elements into the son-based template. For example, bongos incorporating quinto phrases are heard on 1920s recordings of son. Several of the timbales cowbell parts introduced during the mambo era of the 1940s are Havana-style guaguanc√≥ guagua patterns: Four different timbales bell parts adapted from guaguanc√≥ guagua patterns. , , , Descargas (mostly instrumental jams sessions) where jazz-influenced improvisation was developed, were first known as rumbitas in the early 1940s.Salazar, Max (Feb 1997). \\"La Descarga Cubana - The Beginning and Its Best\\". Latin Beat Magazine 7 (9). The musicians improvised with a rumba sensibility. By the 1950s the rhythmic vocabulary of the rumba quinto was the source of a great deal of rhythmically dynamic phrases and passages heard in Cuban popular music and Latin jazz. Even with today‚Äôs flashy percussion solos, where snare rudiments and other highly developed techniques are used, analysis of the prevailing accents will often reveal an underlying quinto structure. In the late 1970s guaguanc√≥ was incorporated into Cuban popular music in the style known as songo. Songo congas play a hybrid of the salidor and quinto, while the timbales or drum kit play an embellishment of the Matanzas-style guagua. Matanzas-style guaguanc√≥ guagua. Basic songo stick pattern. Contemporary timba musicians cite rumba as a primary source of inspiration in composing and arranging. Timba composer Alain P√©rez states: \\"In order to get this spontaneous and natural feel, you should know la rumba . . . all the percussion, quinto improvising.\\"P√©rez, Alain. Interview. Timba.com (2000). Styles Traditionally rumba has been classified into three main subgenres: yamb√∫, guaguanc√≥ and columbia. Both yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥ originated in the solares, large houses in the poorest districts of Havana and Matanzas mostly inhabited by the descendants of enslaved Africans. Both styles are thus predominantly urban, danced by men and women alike, and exhibit a historical \\"binarization\\" of their meter, as described by Cuban musicologist Rolando Antonio P√©rez Fern√°ndez. In contrast, columbia has a primarily rural origin, also in the central regions of Cuba, being almost exclusively danced by men, and remaining much more grounded in West African (especifically Abaku√° traditions), which is exemplified by its triple meter. During the 20th century, these styles have evolved, and other subgenres have appeared such as guarapachangueo and bat√°-rumba. In all rumba styles, there is a gradual heightening of tension and dynamics, not simply between dancers but also between dancers and musicians and dancers and spectator/participants.‚Äù Daniel (1995), p. 70. Yamb√∫ Yamb√∫ is considered the oldest style of rumba, originating in colonial times. Hence, it is often called \\"yamb√∫ de tiempo Espa√±a\\" (yamb√∫ of Spanish times). It has the slowest tempo of all rumba styles and its dance incorporates movements feigning frailty. It can be danced alone (usually by women) or by men and women together. Although male dancers may flirt with female dancers during the dance, they do not use the vacunao of guaguanc√≥. In Matanzas the basic quinto part for yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥ alternates the tone-slap melody. The following example shows the sparsest form of the basic Matanzas-style quinto for yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥. The first measure is tone-slap-tone, and the second measure is the opposite: slap-tone- slap.Pe√±alosa (2011), p. 10. Regular note-heads indicate open tones and triangle note-heads indicate slaps. Basic Matanzas-style quinto part for yamb√∫ and guaguanc√≥. Guaguanc√≥ Guaguanc√≥ is the most popular and influential rumba style. It is similar to yamb√∫ in most aspects, having derived from it, but it has a faster tempo. The term \\"guaguanc√≥\\" originally referred to a narrative song style (coros de guaguanc√≥) which emerged from the coros de clave of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rogelio Mart√≠nez Fur√© states: ‚Äú[The] old folks contend that strictly speaking, the guaguanc√≥ is the narrative.\\"Mart√≠nez Fur√©, Rogelio (1963). Conjunto Folkl√≥rico Nacional de Cuba. Havana, Cuba: Consejo Nacional de Cultura. The term guaguanc√≥ itself may derive etimologically from the guagua instrument. > Guaguanc√≥ is a couple dance of sexual competition between the male and > female. The male periodically attempts to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù his partner with a single > thrust of his pelvis.

Holding onto the ends of her skirt while > seductively moving her upper and lower body in contrary motion, the female > ‚Äúopens‚Äù and ‚Äúcloses‚Äù her skirt in rhythmic cadence with the music. The male > attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, > accented by the quinto, until he is in position to ‚Äúinject‚Äù her. The female > reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of her skirts together, or > covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the > ‚Äúinjection.‚Äù Most of the time the male dancer does not succeed in ‚Äúcatching‚Äù > his partner. The dance is performed with good-natured humor. Vernon Boggs states that the woman's \\"dancing expertise resides in her ability to entice the male while skillfully avoiding being touched by his vacunao.\\" Boggs, Vernon (1992). Salsiology. Columbia Rumba columbia performance in Washington, DC (2008). Columbia is a fast and energetic rumba, in a triple- pulse (, ) structure, and often accompanied the standard bell pattern struck on a guataca ('hoe blade') or a metal bell. Columbia originated in the hamlets, plantations, and docks where men of African descent worked together. Unlike other rumba styles, columbia is traditionally meant to be a solo male dance. According to Cuban rumba master and historian Gregorio \\"El Goyo\\" Hern√°ndez, columbia originated from the drum patterns and chants of religious Cuban Abaku√° traditions. The drum patterns of the lowest conga drum is essentially the same in both columbia and Abaku√°. The rhythmic phrasing of the Abaku√° lead drum bonk√≥ enchemiy√° is similar, and in some instances, identical to columbia quinto phrases.Pe√±alosa (2009), pp. 186-191. Abaku√° bonk√≥ phrase which is also played by the quinto in Columbia. In Matanzas, the melody of the basic columbia quinto part alternates with every clave. As seen in the example below, the first measure is tone-slap-tone, while the second measure is the inverse: slap-tone-slap.Pe√±alosa (2011), p. 19. Basic Matanzas-style columbia quinto part. The guagua (c√°scara or palito) rhythm of columbia, beaten either with two sticks on a guagua (hollowed piece of bamboo) or on the rim of the congas, is the same as the pattern used in abaku√° music, played by two small plaited rattles (erikundi) filled with beans or similar objects. One hand plays the triple-pulse rumba clave pattern, while the other plays the four main beats. Abaku√° erikundi and Columbia guagua pattern. The fundamental salidor and segundo drum melody of the Havana-style columbia, is an embellishment of six cross-beats.Pe√±alosa (2009), p. 33. The combined open tones of these drums generate the melodic foundation. Each cross-beat is \\"doubled,\\" that is, the very next pulse is also sounded. Havana-style Columbia salidor and segundo composite melody Columbia quinto phrases correspond directly to accompanying dance steps. The pattern of quinto strokes and the pattern of dance steps are at times identical, and at other times, imaginatively matched. The quinto player must be able to switch phrases immediately in response to the dancer's ever-changing steps. The quinto vocabulary is used to accompany, inspire and in some ways, compete with the dancers' spontaneous choreography. According to Yvonne Daniel, \\"the columbia dancer kinesthetically relates to the drums, especially the quinto (...) and tries to initiate rhythms or answer the riffs as if he were dancing with the drum as a partner.\\"Daniel (1995), p. 69. Men may also compete with other men to display their agility, strength, confidence and even sense of humor. Some of these aforementioned aspects of rumba Columbia are derived from a colonial Cuban martial art/dance called juego de man√≠ which shares similarities to Brazilian capoeira. Columbia incorporates many movements derived from Abaku√° and yuka dances, as well as Spanish flamenco, and contemporary expressions of the dance often incorporate breakdancing and hip hop moves. In recent decades, women are also beginning to dance columbia.

The passages were taken from the old school house in the village (now Brennens shop). The general story suggests that a Colonel John Staunton Rochford 1802-1844 returned from fighting in the British army in the Napoleonic wars. He was credited with some act of valour while fighting around the Spanish city of Bilboa. Hence he became known as Rochford of Bilboa, where as his family before him where the Rochfords of Clogrennene. Later members of his family seem to have being involved in some capacity with the building of Bilboa Church 1850. Since then the area has known as Bilboa.

Biography Shipley was born in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey on 10 March 1861. He was brought up in Datchet, Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), and educated at University College School. He enrolled at St Bartholomew's Hospital as a medical student in 1879, but in the following year transferred to Christ's College, Cambridge to read natural sciences, specialising in zoology. Shipley particularly specialised in the study of parasitic worms, publishing nearly fifty papers on them and leading to his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1904. He stayed at Cambridge after graduation, being appointed university demonstrator in comparative anatomy in 1886, lecturer in the advanced morphology of the Invertebrata in 1894, and reader in zoology in 1908. He was elected a fellow of Christ's College in 1887 and became college tutor in natural sciences in 1892. In 1891 he was appointed secretary to Cambridge's Museums and Lecture Rooms Syndicate, which effectively put him in charge of all university laboratories and museums. In 1910 he was elected Master of Christ's College, a post he held until his death, and from 1917 to 1919 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. In 1893, he published The Zoology of the Invertebrata, which became a popular university textbook. His Textbook of Zoology, written jointly with Ernest MacBride, appeared in 1901 and was followed by three further editions up to 1920. Between 1895 and 1909 he co-edited, with Sidney Frederic Harmer, the ten- volume Cambridge Natural History. He was co-editor, with George Nuttall, of the journal Parasitology from 1908 to 1914, and also assisted in editing the Journal of Economic Biology from 1905 to 1913.

In 1918, Shipley was a member of the British University Mission to the United States, sent by the Foreign Office to counteract German propaganda in American universities and to promote postgraduate study by American students at British universities. In recognition of this work and other wartime services (including making the Christ's College Master's Lodge available as a convalescent home for wounded officers), Shipley was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. He was appointed chairman of the governing body of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, on its foundation in 1921. He died on 22 September 1927.

Kiiking is a sport invented in Estonia by Ado Kosk in 1993. In Estonian, kiik means a swing. Kiiking is a sport invented and promoted in Estonia, which involves a person making a swing gain increasingly more momentum. The goal is to pass over the spindle with the longest shafts possible. In a kiiking swing, the swing arms are made of steel to enable a person to swing 360 degrees going over the fulcrum of the swing. A person is fastened to the swing base by his feet. To swing, the person begins to pump by squatting and standing up on the swing. The swing will gain momentum and will, by skillful pumping, take a person over the fulcrum. Kiiking is regulated by the Estonian Kiiking Federation. History The practice of swinging has had an important place in Estonian culture for a long time. Traditional village swings have been prevalent in rural communal lands for centuries, places where villagers held festivities. (Translated abstract available) The construction of kiiking swings is radically different from village swings, however.Estonian boys swinging over the spindle at Ohessaare village in Saaremaa in 1913; an early form of kiiking. The first kiiking swing was made by Ado Kosk in 1993. Kosk observed that it becomes more difficult to swing over the fulcrum as the arms of the swing become longer. He then designed telescoping swing arms to gradually extend the arms for an increased challenge. The person able to swing over the fulcrum with the longest swing arms is the winner. First modern kiiking swing with adjustable shafts was made in 1996.

However, stable owner Harry F. Guggenheim took a chance on Ycaza, hiring him for the 1959 racing season. Guggenheim's Cain Hoy Stable was one of the major Thoroughbred racing operations in the U.S. and Ycaza's ten-year affiliation with them saw him become one of the country's top jockeys and be voted the 1964 George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award by his peers.

He was the first Director of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) when it was founded in 1984. He lost his post in 1991 after being convicted of corruption in a much- publicised trial. In 1998, he was again tried and convicted for misappropriating money while in office. Background Knight was a student of Anglo-Chinese School. In the 1990s, he was the vice-chairman of its Old Boys' Association and a member of its board of governors. He obtained his bachelor of laws degree from the National University of Singapore in the 1960s, and played the guitar in a jazz band to raise money for his tuition fees. He joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1970 and rose through the ranks \\"with the speed and power of an Exocet missile,\\" as Queen's Counsel Roy Allaway later described it. Soon he acquired a reputation for being a law enforcer who prosecuted criminals without fear or favour. News of his ability and integrity impressed the late David Marshall, so much that when he retired he offered to give Knight a full partnership in his law firm; however, Knight was content to remain in the Legal Service and declined the offer. Knight is married to Pathmavali Rengayah. The couple have no children. Notable cases In 1978, Knight was the deputy public prosecutor in the trial of former magistrate Khoo Hin Hiong. In 1983, he acted for the Prosecution again in the trial of Adrian Lim, who had murdered two children. In 1985, he was the senior state counsel and deputy public prosecutor who filed an affidavit on behalf of the Attorney- General requesting that the High Court cite five defendants for contempt of court over an editorial published in the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) on 17 October 1985. Titled \\"Jeyaretnam's Challenge\\", the editorial had questioned the \\"integrity and impartiality\\" of Singapore's judicial system. The affidavit led to an apology from the editor of the AWSJ. In 1986, he was the public prosecutor for the Commercial Affairs Investigation Department who filed charges against key people in Pan Electric Industries (\\"Pan-El\\"), such as Tan Kok Liang, Tan Koon Swan, and Peter Tham, in the aftermath of the company's collapse. For his role in the Pan-El investigations, Knight was commended by then-Finance Minister Richard Hu in 1989. Knight also led the prosecution team in Singapore's first case of insider trading, that of former United Overseas Bank banker Allan Ng. On National Day 1990 (9 August 1990), he was awarded the Public Administration Medal, Gold, for his work as Director of the Commercial Affairs Department. First investigation and trial On 23 March 1991, Knight was suddenly replaced as CAD director by Senior State Counsel Lawrence Ang in a decision that shocked the local legal community. It turned out that Knight was under investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). After an investigation lasting more than two months‚Äîone of the longest probes into the conduct of a public servant in Singapore‚ÄîKnight was arrested on 27 May 1991 and charged with corruption the next day. He was the first Singapore legal officer to face such charges. Specifically, he was accused of cheating three businessmen into investing S$3,000,000 each into the former Batam Island Country Club on the Indonesian island of Batam, as well as giving false information to the CPIB regarding vehicle purchases, an application for a car loan, and his corporate investments. The judge originally set Knight's trial to commence in October 1992, but changed his mind and brought it forward to September 1991 after the prosecution complained that its witnesses had been subject to intimidation, and investigating officers had received mysterious phone calls warning them to \\"watch out\\". In July that year, his wife and two others were also arrested and charged over the Batam resort investments. In a district court on 29 September 1991, Knight pleaded guilty to cheating then managing director of Trans-Island Bus Services Ng Ser Miang to try to make him invest in the Batam resort project, which had been planned by Knight and his wife. In October, he was sentenced to three months in prison. Knight appealed against the sentence, and in March 1992 he managed to get his sentence reduced to a $17,000 fine and a day in prison.Knight v. Public Prosecutor [1992] 1 SLR 720. See also He served the jail sentence and paid the fine on the day it was announced. In deciding to reduce the sentence, High Court Judge L.P. Thean said that a \\"nominal custodial sentence\\" was sufficient given the mitigating circumstances in Knight's case.In his judgment, Thean J. said, \\"I consider that the imposition of the nominal custodial sentence is appropriate in this case; I do not consider it at all a farce. It signifies that in the court's view, the appellant must suffer a custodial sentence, albeit a nominal one, and also that, but for the very strong mitigating and other circumstances in his favour, a substantive term of imprisonment would have been meted out to the appellant\\": see Knight v. Public Prosecutor, op. cit. at para. 28. See also In April, all charges against his wife in relation to his case were also dropped. Aftermath of first conviction Although the sentence meted to him was eventually reduced, the corruption case had left permanent damage on Knight's career as a civil servant. After investigations on him began in March 1991, he faced disciplinary hearings and his services were terminated on 26 March 1992. The President also revoked the prestigious Public Administration Medal, Gold, that had been awarded to Knight. In August 1994, the High Court struck Knight off the roll of advocates and solicitors, meaning that he could no longer practise law.Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam [1994] 3 SLR 531. See also After being disbarred, Knight worked as a consultant in a public-listed company. Second investigation and trial In 1998, Knight was again charged in court‚Äîthis time with criminal breach of trust by misappropriating money totalling $4,200 when still the CAD's Director on two occasions, in 1989 and 1990. This second charge caused Knight to resign from his job. During the trial, the defence argued that the proceedings were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney-General's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations, in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial. They argued that the latest set of charges stemmed from that investigation and thus were subject to the immunity clause. The CPIB revealed that it had been tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant. The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 probe into Knight's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money. Eventually the court found him guilty of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and another day in jail.  Aftermath of second conviction The second conviction left Knight even worse off than before. The company he was working for before his second trial refused to re-employ him. Jobless, he engaged himself in community work in his church, Covenant Community Methodist Church, and often visited a pub in Boat Quay of which his wife was a partner. He faded quietly from public life. On 25 April 2007, he re-appeared in the news when he filed an application seeking court approval to be reinstated as a lawyer. His application was granted on 22 May 2007, making him only the sixth lawyer to be reinstated in the Law Society of Singapore's 35-year history. He will be joining the law firm Bernard & Rada Law Corporation.

Barnum & Bailey for 20 years. He was inducted into the International Clown Hall of Fame in 1989. Adler and his wife, Amelia, were the first American husband and wife independent circus, and he was the second clown to appear on television after Sombris Aremelo, an Italian clown.Felix Adler biography Amelia Adler appeared, in costume and makeup, as a guest on April 10, 1955 episode of the American television quiz program, What's My Line?. Adler also performed in the film The Greatest Show on Earth. In addition to his \\"King Of Clowns\\" moniker, Adler was known as \\"The White House Clown\\" for his number of command performances before United States Presidents. His outlandish costumes often featured a huge grossly exaggerated posterior, made from two inflated beach balls held in place by a brassiere-like canvas sling. Identified in the annals of Clowndom as a \\"Whiteface\\" clown, his exclusive \\"face\\" was easily differentiated from other clowns by a sparkling rhinestone embedded in the tip of his red putty nose. During his career, Adler performed before millions of circus fans in the United States. His image was placed onto at least two classic Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus posters, and a commercial mask resembling this face was created and sold by Verne Langdon.

The first edition was released to arcades (mostly in Japan, but a few in other countries) in late 2005. The games feature an original all-female cast, and after choosing a character, the player chooses an \\"elemental alignment,\\" or Arcana, which determines the character's special moves. Games=Arcana Heart In mid- March 2006, a patch was released for Arcana Heart called Arcana Heart Full!. The patch fixed a variety of issues, toning down overly-powerful characters and \\"buffing up\\" weaker characters. However, a controversy arose when Examu priced the patch, which was physically housed on a single custom chip, at ¬•78,000 each, whereas similar patches for similar games have been released for free (such as the patch for Melty Blood: Act Cadenza). =Console version= On July 5, 2006, it was announced that a console version of the game would be slated for release on PlayStation 2 in Japan on October 12, 2006. Arcana Party Blog The home version allows the option of playing individual characters in \\"Original\\" or \\"Full,\\" reflecting the original and patched versions of characters from the arcade version. Voice acting was also added to all story segments. On April 11, 2007, the game was released in North America. A notable difference between Arcana Heart and most other US PlayStation 2 titles is that the game has only Japanese voiceovers and no English voiceovers. Examu removed the voices present in the Japanese console version's story mode as well as pre-battle and victory screens, but kept the voices used in battle. Arcana Heart 2 Arcana Heart 2 is the sequel to Arcana Heart. It was the first game in the series to be developed and published by Examu after the rights of the franchise had been transferred to the company from Yuki Enterprise. It was also the first game for Examu's proprietary eX-Board, an arcade board based on Windows XP Embedded that would become the standard platform for the rest of the series and other arcade games published by Examu. The game was unveiled at the AOU2008 Amusement Expo. Game Watch report on AOU 2008 The game features 6 new fighters, each with their own unique Arcana. New techniques were also included, such as the Arcana Blast, allowing the player to become temporarily invulnerable; Arcana Homing, a feature allowing the player to simultaneously close the distance between them and the opponent while homing in on them; and the Critical Heart, a devastating special attack unique to each character. =Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2= On October 30, 2008, Examu released a major update to Arcana Heart 2 called Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2. This version further balanced the game and fixed some bugs. It also featured some design changes, such as new character illustrations and a red redesign for Kaya Hirotaka. New additions included an additional stage; three new characters: Akane Inuwaka, Nazuna Inuwaka, and Parace L'Sia; their respective Arcana: Fenex (Sound), Kayatsuhime (Flower), Parace L'sia (Life); new color palettes for each character, available by pressing the Start button on the character select screen; and an additional training mode. Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2 was further updated to version 2.6 on February 27, 2009. AQ Interactive handled the PlayStation 2 port of Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2, which was released only in Japan on April 9, 2009. It was planned for a worldwide release but was cancelled due to low sales of the first one, as well as poor performance and slowdown in gameplay, making the port weaker than the arcade perfect port of the first one.

He is best known for his orchestration of George Harrison albums such as All Things Must Pass (1970) and for his association with Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Barham trained at the Royal College of Music and the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, before establishing himself during the mid 1960s as a composer of piano interpretations of Indian classical ragas. He became a student of Shankar, for whose East‚ÄìWest collaborations with Yehudi Menuhin and others he transcribed Indian melodies into Western musical annotation. Through Shankar, Barham began a long friendship with Harrison in 1966, then a member of the Beatles, which assisted Harrison's own education in Indian music as well as his promotion of the genre to Western audiences. Barham collaborated with Harrison on the latter's Wonderwall Music soundtrack album (1968), before providing the orchestral arrangements for All Things Must Pass songs such as \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\", and for Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World. Most often in the role of orchestral or choral arranger, Barham also contributed to albums such as the Beatles' Let It Be, John Lennon's Imagine and Gary Wright's Footprint in the early 1970s. His projects as a music producer during the same period included three albums by progressive rock band Quintessence, and he has worked on film or TV soundtracks for directors Otto Preminger, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jonathan Miller. Other artists with whom Barham has worked include Elton John, Andr√© Previn, Phil Spector, Roger Daltrey, Yoko Ono and Jackie Lomax. Continuing his interest in Indian music, Barham released an album with sarodya Aashish Khan in 1973, Jugalbandi, and contributed to Shankar's final collaboration with Harrison, Chants of India, in 1996. Among his educational positions, he has taught at Trinity College of Music, London, and in Ghana at the Achimota School. Early recognition and work with Ravi Shankar Born in London in the 1940s, John Barham studied piano, trumpet and music composition at the Royal College of Music. He then attended London University's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), where he developed an interest in Indian classical music. Among English classical musicians of the mid 1960s, Barham's piano compositions based on Indian ragas were unprecedented and brought him to the attention of members of India's cultural community in London. Some of his works were first performed and recorded for radio broadcast by British pianist John Bingham (Reflections and Piano Concerto). Barham became a student of Indian sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar, whose international popularity by 1966 had grown to include Western rock audiences.Robert Shelton, \\"Indian Raga Music Gains in Popularity Across U.S.\\" , New York Times, 20 December 1966 (retrieved 3 December 2013).Ken Hunt, \\"Ravi Shankar\\", AllMusic (retrieved 24 November 2013). In June that year, Barham attended the Bath Music Festival in the west of England, where Shankar and American violinist Yehudi Menuhin were due to perform an historic duet.Leng, p. 26. At Shankar's request, Barham transcribed the sitarist's adaptation of Raga Tilang into Western musical annotation for Menuhin's benefit, after Shankar had been dissatisfied with German musician Peter Feuchtwanger's attempt to adapt the same raga.Lavezzoli, p. 62. Later in 1966, on Menuhin and Shankar's Grammy Award-winning album West Meets East,World Music: The Rough Guide, p. 109. Barham supplied liner notes,\\"Credits: Yehudi Menuhin and Ravi Shankar West Meets East\\", AllMusic (retrieved 1 December 2013). explaining the various musical terms particular to Indian music.Sleeve credits, West Meets East LP (HMV Records, 1966). He served as musical annotator on several subsequent East‚ÄìWest collaborations by Shankar,Lavezzoli, pp. 62, 198. who described him as \\"a brilliant young pianist\\".Shankar, p. 183. One such project was Shankar's score for Alice in Wonderland (1966),Alan Clayson, \\"Off the Wall\\", in Mojo: The Beatles' Final Years, p. 50. a BBC TV film directed by Jonathan Miller.Michael Brooke, \\"Alice in Wonderland (1966)\\", BFI Screenonline (retrieved 19 February 2014).Shankar, p. 196. Association with George Harrison During this period, Barham met George Harrison of the Beatles through Shankar,Leng, pp. 25‚Äì26. who had adopted the guitarist as his sitar student.Lavezzoli, pp. 176‚Äì77. Harrison was fascinated by Barham's interpretations of ragas, and based his 1967 song \\"Blue Jay Way\\" on a piano piece that Barham had derived from Raga Marwa.Leng, pp. 26‚Äì27. In March 1967,Lavezzoli, p. 178. Barham attended the recording session for Harrison's Indian-styled composition \\"Within You, Without You\\", released on the Beatles' seminal album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.Leng, pp. 30‚Äì31. Barham later wrote the choral arrangements for Phil Spector's controversial productionMerrell Noden, \\"Extra-celestial\\", in Mojo: The Beatles' Final Years, p. 127. of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\",Lewisohn, p. 349. issued on the band's final album, Let It Be (1970).Williams, pp. 149, 150. Several commentators credit Harrison as the person most responsible for Indian music's surge in popularity in the West from 1966 onwards, via his work with the Beatles and his public endorsement of Shankar.World Music: The Rough Guide, pp. 109‚Äì10.Lavezzoli, pp. 171‚Äì72.Clayson, pp. 191, 209‚Äì10. Among these, author Simon Leng has described Barham as both a \\"birth partner\\"Rip Rense, \\"The Rip Post Interview with Simon Leng\\", The Rip Post, 2006 (archived version retrieved 18 February 2014). and the \\"closest confidant and fellow traveler\\" to Harrison during the latter's immersion in the genre.Leng, pp. 27, 320. Harrison solo albums Barham played a key collaborative role on Harrison's soundtrack to the Joe Massot-directed film Wonderwall (1968).Leng, pp. 47, 49‚Äì50. In addition to participating in recording sessions held at London's Abbey Road Studios in late 1967, Barham transcribed Harrison's melodies into an annotation that the Beatle was then able to share with Indian musicians in Bombay, where part of the album was recorded in January 1968. Released as Wonderwall Music, and described by author Peter Lavezzoli as \\"a charming potpourri of Indian and Western sounds\\",Lavezzoli, p. 182. it features Barham on piano, harmonium and flugelhorn, and in the role of orchestral arranger.Spizer, p. 206. Following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970, Barham supplied the orchestral arrangements on Harrison's acclaimed triple album All Things Must Pass (1970).Clayson, p. 292. The album was co- produced by Spector, whose \\"distant and authoritarian\\" style Barham says he found difficult to adapt to after the \\"intimate, friendly atmosphere\\" typical of Harrison sessions.Leng, p. 80. The songs to which Barham contributed include the international hits \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"What Is Life\\", the album's title track, and \\"Isn't It a Pity\\".Spizer, pp. 212, 222, 225. The last of these, Leng writes, \\"captures the depth of the musical understanding between George Harrison and John Barham\\", in the interplay between slide guitar, orchestra and choir.Leng, p. 87. Barham provided the orchestration for Harrison's successful follow-up to All Things Must Pass, Living in the Material World (1973). His arrangements on that album include the string, brass and choral parts on \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", \\"Who Can See It\\" and \\"That Is All\\".Spizer, pp. 254‚Äì55. Other Beatles-related recordings Barham also worked on Harrison's projects with acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label.Andy Childs, \\"The History of Jackie Lomax\\", ZigZag, July 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 17 February 2014). Among these releases was Is This What You Want? (1969) by Jackie Lomax,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 202. That's the Way God Planned It (1969) by Billy Preston,Album credits, That's the Way God Planned It CD (Capitol/Apple Records, 1991; produced by George Harrison, Wayne Schuler & Ray Charles). and Radha Krishna Temple (London)'s 1970 hit single \\"Govinda\\".Spizer, p. 341. The latter was a musical adaptation of a sacred Hindu poem from the Satya Yuga.Greene, pp. 132, 169‚Äì71. Through his connection with Harrison, Barham also played harpsichord on Yoko Ono's \\"Who Has Seen the Wind?\\",Spizer, p. 28. released in February 1970 as the B-side to John Lennon's Spector-produced single \\"Instant Karma!\\"Castleman & Podrazik, p. 85. Following the success of All Things Must Pass, Barham contributed to Ronnie Spector's \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" single,Leng, pp. 105, 133‚Äì34. Lennon's song \\"Jealous Guy\\" (from Imagine) and Gary Wright's album Footprint, all recorded in 1971.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 100‚Äì01, 104, 171, 208. He has said of working with Wright and Harrison that \\"there was a strong [musical] rapport among the three of us\\" and describes Wright's song \\"Love to Survive\\" as \\"one of the most emotionally powerful love songs that I have ever worked on\\".Leng, p. 108. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, music journalist Richard Williams writes of Barham's orchestration on \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\": \\"[The strings and mandolins] sweep and soar in great blocks of sound, pirouetting around each other like a corps de ballet in slow motion. The closing portions of the orchestral arrangement are breathtaking, displaying a geometrical logic which makes use of suspended rhythms drawn out to screaming point.\\"Williams, pp. 161‚Äì62. Production for Quintessence and Jugalbandi album Barham became involved in music production in the late 1960s, working with Quintessence.Ralph Beauvert, \\"John Barham\\", mooncowhq.ch (retrieved 17 February 2014). The latter were a Notting Hill-based progressive rock band who, like Harrison,Lavezzoli, pp. 178, 194‚Äì95, 197. incorporated a Hindu- aligned spiritual message in their music.Bruce Eder, \\"Quintessence\\", AllMusic (retrieved 17 February 2014). Barham produced and provided arrangements on the band's first three albums ‚Äì In Blissful Company, Quintessence and Dive Deep ‚Äì all released on Island Records between 1969 and 1971.Colin Harper, \\"Quintessence: The Spirit Is Willing\\", Record Collector, May 2014; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 4 September 2015).

In a 2014 feature article on Quintessence, for Record Collector, Colin Harper praised Barham's contributions to the band's work, labelling him \\"their very own George Martin ‚Ä¶ honing their onstage magic into sublime studio sculptures\\". Following singer Shiva Shankar Jones's departure from Quintessence, Barham produced his new band's eponymous album, Kala (1972). In 1973, Barham and Indian sarod player Aashish Khan released an album on Elektra Records, titled Jugalbandi\\"John Barham and Ashish Khan ‚Äì Jugalbandi\\", discogs.com (retrieved 17 February 2014). ‚Äì the word commonly used for duets in Hindustani classical music.World Music: The Rough Guide, p. 76.Lavezzoli, p. 53.

Switzerland, which is a member of EFTA but not of the EEA, is not bound by the Directive but rather has a separate bilateral agreement on free movement with the EU. It consolidated older regulations and directives, and extended the rights of unmarried couples. It gives EEA citizens the right of free movement and residence across the European Economic Area, as long as they are not an undue burden on the country of residence and have comprehensive health insurance.Article 7(1) of the Directive. This right also extends to close family members that are not EEA citizens. After five years, the right of residence becomes permanent, which means it does not depend on any precondition any longer. Contents The Directive contains the following chapters: * Chapter I (articles 1‚Äì3): General provisions (subject, definitions and beneficiaries) * Chapter II (articles 4‚Äì5): Right of exit and entry * Chapter III (articles 6‚Äì15): Right of residence * Chapter IV: Right of permanent residence ** Section I (articles 16‚Äì18): Eligibility ** Section II (articles 19‚Äì21): Administrative formalities * Chapter V (articles 22‚Äì26): Provisions common to the right of residence and the right of permanent residence * Chapter VI (articles 27‚Äì33): Restrictions on the right of entry and the right of residence on grounds of public policy, public security or public health * Chapter VII (articles 34‚Äì42): Final provisions Scope Pursuant to articles 4 and 5 of the directive, any EEA citizen can leave his/her own country and enter another EEA state without a visa by presenting a valid passport or national identity card. If an EEA citizen is unable to present a valid passport or national identity card at the border, he/she must nonetheless be afforded every reasonable opportunity to obtain the necessary documents within a reasonable period of time or corroborate or prove by other means that he/she is covered by the right of free movement. The directive applies to any EEA citizen who is moving to and living in an EEA state other than his/her own (the exclusion is based on the principle of non-interference with purely national issues). However, it also applies when a European citizen is moving back to his/her home country after staying in another EEA state, as defined in the case of Surinder Singh.Case C-370/90 For dual citizens with two EEA nationalities the directive can apply in any EEA state. Temporary limitations are in place for the new member states of the EU. To be fully covered by the European right of free movement, the EEA citizen needs to exercise one of the four treaty rights: * working as an employee (this includes looking for work for a reasonable amount of time), * working as a self-employed person, * studying, * being self-sufficient or retired. These rights are named after the Treaty of Rome, which defines the freedom of movement for workers. They have been extended over time, and are mainly of historical significance by now, since being self-sufficient has been added to the list. As long as a citizen has sufficient money or income not to rely on public funds and holds comprehensive health insurance, he/she exercises one or more treaty rights. If no treaty right is exercised, the right of free movement is limited to three months. Family members are also covered by the right of free movement, but only as a dependent of the EEA citizen. The right is limited to the EEA state in which the EEA citizen is exercising treaty rights. In certain cases (e.g. divorce after at least 3 years of marriage where 1 year must have been spent in the host member state), the family member can retain the right of residence. A family member is defined as: * the spouse (unless in a marriage of convenience), * the registered partner, * a child under the age of 21, or * a dependent child or parent (of the EEA citizen or partner). There is a second category of extended family members, which can be included at the discretion of national legislation. It covers dependent relatives (especially siblings), dependent household members and unmarried/unregistered partners in a \\"durable relationship\\". Status The right of free movement is granted automatically when the requirements are fulfilled, and it is not subject to an administrative act. However, member states may require the EEA citizen and family members to register with the relevant authorities. The relevant documentations are: * an entry visa for non-EEA family members if they are Annex I nationals and do not hold a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen issued by another member state, * a residence certificate (for EEA citizens) or a residence card (for non-EEA family members), which may be valid for up to 5 years and confirms the right of residence, * a permanent residence certificate or a permanent residence card, which certifies the right of permanent residence. Permanent residence is acquired automatically after exercising treaty rights for 5 years, with absences of normally less than 6 months a year, a single absence less than 12 months in certain circumstances (birth, severe sickness, etc.), or longer for military services.Article 16(3) of the Directive. Permanent residence removes any restrictions that are in place concerning access to public funds (such as unemployment benefits, a state pension etc.), although some of these restrictions are already lifted after a period of 3 months. Permanent residence is only lost after an absence of 2 years. All applications covered by the directive are free, or require at most a moderate fee similar to comparable national documents. Implementation= Austria  In Austria, the directive is transposed into national law mainly via the Niederlassungs- und Aufenthaltsgesetz (regarding residence) and the Fremdenpolizeigesetz (regarding entrance). The applications are handled locally at the Magistrat or Bezirkshauptmannschaft (except in Styria where the Landeshauptmann takes direct responsibility). A credit card sized plastic card (costing about ‚Ç¨57 in 2010) is issued to document one's right. Germany In Germany, the directive is transposed into national law via the Freiz√ºgigkeitsgesetz/EU, which could be translated as freedom of movement law/EU. Wikipedia has a short German article on it. Not all mandatory sections of the Directive are included in the Freiz√ºgigkeitsgesetz/EU. The applications are handled locally, together with the mandatory registration of residence.  Iceland and Norway  The EEA countries have had to implement this directive in full. In Norway this was implemented by changing the Alien Law (Norwegian: utlendingsloven), which entered into force on 1. Jan 2010.  Italy  In Italy the directive has been implemented into Italian legislation with Legislative Decree n. 30 February 6, 2007 The applications are handled by the \\"Comune\\" of the city where the applicant takes his or her residence. Ireland In Ireland, the Directive is transposed into the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 amended by SI 310 of 2008 in reaction to the Metock caseCase C‚Äë127/081 and amended by SI 146 of 2011 allowing visa free entrance with a residence card issued by another EEA member state. The non-EEA family members of Irish citizens resident in Ireland are not normally issued EU Family Residency Cards (called Stamp 4 EU FAM) unless the Irish citizen and family members previously lived together in another EU state. The Netherlands Applications are submitted locally at the municipality (\\"gemeente\\" in Dutch) together with the mandatory registration of residence, but they are processed centrally at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst, IND). There is a charge (‚Ç¨53 in 2015) associated with the application. The family members of Dutch citizens who are and have always been resident in the Netherlands are not permitted to hold EU Family Residency Cards, because EU nationals who have always lived in the country of their nationality are not exercising EU treaty rights and are therefore not considered EU citizens under Dutch law for the purposes of the Directive.Embassy of Netherlands page on 2004/38/EC  Sweden  In Sweden the directive has been implemented through changes in several laws, like the Alien Act (SFS 2005:716), and the Aliens Decree (SFS 2006:97). Until 2015 Sweden did not follow the directive fully, as the national identity card was not accepted when a Swedish citizen left Sweden for a non-Schengen EU member state, like the UK. The passport act (SFS 1978:302) required a passport.  Switzerland  Switzerland is not part of the EU or EEA, but has bilateral agreements with the EU in several fields, including free movement of people. There is an agreement, which contains the same principles as the directive.Agreement with the Swiss Federation: free movement of persons This includes: *the right to personal and geographical mobility; *the right of residence for members of the family and their right to pursue an economic activity, irrespective of their nationality; *the right to acquire immovable property, specifically in order to establish a main or secondary residence in the host State; and *the right to return to the host State after the end of an economic activity or period of residence there for citizens of EU, EEA and Switzerland in all these countries. Switzerland has had to adopt amendments when the directive was updated or new member countries were added. United Kingdom In the UK, the directive is transposed into the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 amended by SI 2009/1117 and amended by SI 2011/1247. The implementation is reasonably complete and accurate although non-EEA family members require an entrance clearance (called EEA Family Permit) to enter the UK even if they are in possession of a 5-year residence card of another EEA member state, in breach of the Directive.see the interpretation of \\"residence card\\" in Regulation 2 of the EEA regulationssee the Correspondence Tablesee the response of the EU Commission to Petition 1307/2007 The UK law recognises same-sex relationships, and it also has a clause for unmarried/unregistered partners. Applications are currently ¬£65:00 + ¬£19.20 for submitting biometric information and an additional ¬£65 per dependant. Since 6 April 2015 the UK applies this directive in full accordance with the European Law for Non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family members.

Most of these remaining Jews were working at Berlin plants or for the Jewish welfare organization. The term was coined by the victims after World War II, the Gestapo called the plan \\"Gro√üe Fabrik-Aktion\\" (Large factory action) . While the plan was not restricted to Berlin, it later became most notable for ensuing the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin. rose colored Litfa√ü column commemorates the event.  Situation  In September 1942 there were about 75,800 Jews left for labour in the arms industry. With the final roundup of Berlin Jews soon to come, the Nazi government informed factory owners that their Jewish workers, even those married to Germans, were going to be deported to labor camps and that the government would work swiftly to replace their labor with forced laborers from the east- factory owners were to prepare for this transition . The RSHA took action planning multiple deportation trains to Riga and Auschwitz.. Because the war consumed most of the transportation capacity the deportations were not performed immediately but the factories were informed that their Jewish labour workers would be \\"evacuated\\" at the end of March 1943 . At the beginning of 1943, the plan included 15,100 Jewish workers in Berlin and 5,300 outside of the capital with most of them living in major cities or labour camps. On 20 February 1943, SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann (a main architect of the Holocaust) and head of sub-department (Referat IV B4) of the RSHA issued details on the \\"technische Durchf√ºhrung der Evakuierung von Juden nach dem Osten\\" (Technical Procedures for the Evacuation of Jews to the East). Within that plan the following groups of Jews would be excluded from deportation: * Jewish partners in mixed marriages * Married Geltungsjuden (people considered to be Jewish under the Nuremberg laws) living with Aryan relatives * Jews over the age of 65 unless married to Jews below that age * Jewish veterans of the First World War carrying medals * and a list of special persons listed by name Though these persons would not be deported they would not be allowed to work in the arms industry. They were to be placed into different positions where they could be called in without the factories to intervene in the deportation.  Action  In most of the cities, the Jews were called in on 26 February 1943 to register the next day with the Gestapo for a check of their labour papers. In Breslau, most of the Jews were rounded up without prior signals the morning of 27 February through interception at their home or work place and transported to the synagogue. In Dresden, the labour camp Hellersberg was used for concentration. In most parts of the Reich, these actions were finished after two days. In Berlin, the roundup of ten thousand Jews began 27 February 1943 in preparation of the Fuhrer's 54th birthday on 20 April. Those arrested were working in various ammunition factories. The arrested persons were transported to six locations in Berlin for concentration: * the main hall of the Clou Concert Hall (a former covered market) on Mauerstra√üe in Mitte district * a garage in the Hermann G√∂ring Barracks in Reinickendorf district * the horse stalls of a barracks on Rathenower Stra√üe in Moabit district * the synagogue on Levetzowstra√üe in Moabit * the Jewish Senior Center (\\"das j√ºdische Altersheim\\") on the Gro√üen Hamburger Stra√üe in Mitte district * the house of the Jewish Community on Rosenstra√üe in Mitte (where Jewish men married to German women were brought, due to their special circumstances of being in a \\"mixed marriage\\") . The \\"Fabrikaktion\\" is perhaps especially noted for engendering the Rosenstrasse protest, in which the \\"Aryan\\" wives of Jewish prisoners protested in front of the Jewish Community on Rosenstrasse for the release of their Jewish husbands. During the 27 February roundup, about 2,000 of the ammunition factory workers were Jewish and in an intermarried relationship, which prompted the protest. \\"Fabrikaktion\\" motivated Germans with strong relationship ties to Jews to become rescuers. German wives felt compelled to protect their Jewish husbands, and were willing to risk more in order to save them as was demonstrated at Rosenstrasse . Forced laborers, even those working under the SS, were taken from their places of work during \\"Fabrikaktion\\". A group of Jewish forced laborers working in the Reich Main Security Office's Library were taken to Auschwitz following this event, with the two surviving men having been saved by their German wives .  Fugitives  About 4,700 of the remaining 11,000 Jews left in Berlin were able to escape and to go into hiding . This matches with stories of survivors telling that they had been warned by their colleagues and foremen - in one case even a police officer - shortly before the action took place. On the other hand, most of the fugitives were captured - the Gestapo used search service and the help of Jewish \\"Greifer\\" collaborators. It is estimated that only 1,500 Jews were able to hide away until the end of the war.  Literature  * Wolf Gruner: Widerstand in der Rosenstra√üe.

Emanu-El means \\"God is with us\\" in Hebrew. News reported in early 2017 that the synagogue would be closing for financial reasons and was \\"taking steps to merge\\" with a nearby congregation. By 2018, the congregation had formally merged with Temple Sinai in Summit, N.J. The synagogue building was sold and has become the Living Stone Christian Church. The former early childhood daycare and Hebrew school buildings have become part of a Mandarin (Chinese) and Spanish language immersion center. History The temple's logo The congregation was founded by 11 families seeking a Reform Jewish service in the growing suburb of Livingston, New Jersey. By the fall of 1955, 56 families had been recruited and High Holy Days services were led by student Rabbi Milton Rosenfeld from the Hebrew Union College. In 1956, the congregation purchased a hot dog stand off Northfield Road as their permanent home. By 1961, ground had been broken at that location to build their own sanctuary, which was designed by architects Peter Blake and Julian Neski. The new building, with its soaring peaked roof, is a landmark in Livingston and evokes the Israelites' Tent of Meeting in the desert wilderness.Official Temple History Most visitors think it looks like Noah's Ark. A major expansion of the building including a new main entrance, office space, the library, and the Holocaust Remembrance Center was completed in 2004. This campaign also included a new Early Childhood Center (ECC). In 2005-2006, the congregation celebrated its 50th anniversary with year-long programs and events. Although smaller than most of the area congregations, it is known for its haimish attitude and welcoming atmosphere. During the Summer of 2011, the sanctuary was renewed, making it both more modern, and more comfortable. Some changes included a new sound system, bimah, ner tamid, and many new features. Temple Emanu-El is a member of the Union for Reform Judaism. In February 2017, The New Jersey Jewish News and the West Essex Tribune both reported that the congregation voted to disband at the end of June, and the temple's board is negotiating a merger with Temple Sinai in the nearby town of Summit. The Jewish News quoted from an email sent by the temple president that cited financial reasons for the decision. As of June 23, 2017, neither the temple's website nor its Facebook page had any apparent reference to the impending change. Social action With the creation of a Social Action Committee in 1964 and the hiring of Rabbi Peter Kasdan in 1971, Emanu-El established itself as a leader on social justice issues. Kasdan organized a nationwide Reform Jewish boycott of grapes in support of the United Farm Workers. The synagogue participated in rallies, marches, and programs on issues such as Soviet Jewry, Ethiopian Jews, Abortion Rights, and Vietnamese Boat People. The congregation adopted and supported one Vietnamese family for years. In more recent years, issues such as Reform rights in Israel,Jewish News Weekly Article from October 17, 1997 on Pluralism Efforts Darfur, Gay & Lesbian rights, and Jewish genetic diseasesStory on Kasdan support of Canavan Foundation have been at the forefront. Other programs Expanding approaches to welcoming interfaith families and Jews-by-Choice, Temple Emanu-El is an inaugural participant in the STAR Synagogue's \\"Calling Synagogue Home\\" project.List of STAR-CSH Participants The building's main entrance Temple Emanu-El received an Honorable Mention for the URJ's Congregation of Learner's Award for Adult EducationURJ Congregation of Learner's Brochure at the URJ Biennial in 2007.

A steam bath is a steam-filled room for the purpose of relaxation and cleansing. It has a long history, going back to Greek and Roman times. History The origins of the steam bath come from the Roman bath, which began during the height of the Roman Empire. Ancient Roman baths served many community and social functions within Roman society. Many citizens in Rome used Roman public baths, regardless of socioeconomic status. These Roman baths were supplied by natural hot springs from beneath the ground.The Cultural Progression of the Spa Historical parts of a spa ‚Äì Roman, medieval, Georgian and Victorian have been restored in Bath, England and is available as a public bath or Thermae.

Early years  A native of the city of Siemianowice ≈ölƒÖskie, an administrative center of the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia, Barbara Maria Szwajnoch joined, in 1969, at the age of 20, Polish United Workers' Party, the name used by the Communist Party ruling Poland since the period following World War II. Family tradition to the contrary, she remained a member until the Party's termination and restructuring twenty years later. From 1968 to 1977 she was employed as a workplace safety specialist at the Chorz√≥w nitrogen works and, by 1976, had graduated from the Silesian University of Technology with a major in sanitary engineering.  Political career  Using her married name, Barbara Blida, she was elected to the Sejm as a member of the Workers' Party in June 1989 and served for six consecutive terms, until 2005. Seven months after taking her seat, following the January 1990 dissolution of the Party in the context of the 1990‚Äì91 fall of Communism, she continued as a member of the Party's political successors, Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (1990‚Äì99) and Democratic Left Alliance (1999‚Äì2004) and, having resigned from the Alliance in 2004, served out her last year as an independent member. During her service in the Sejm, she was appointed, on 26 October 1993, to the cabinet of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak as Minister for Construction and Spatial Management and served in that capacity in subsequent governments of J√≥zef Oleksy and W≈Çodzimierz Cimoszewicz until 31 December 1996, when the ministry was transformed into the Central Office for Housing and Municipal Development, with Blida remaining in charge until Cimoszewicz's government ended its term on 17 October 1997. The ministry ended with her and, three years later was restored as Ministry of Regional Development and Construction, headed by Jerzy Kropiwnicki. Following tenure as a member of the cabinet, she continued as a member of the Sejm for eight years, but also ventured into business, becoming, in 2001, the president of J.W. Construction sp. z o.o., one of Poland's largest real-estate developers.  Accusation of corruption followed by suicide  According to media accounts and later official reports, Barbara Blida was named as one of the officials who received illegal payments from businesswoman Barbara Kmiecik, one of the richest women in the country during the 1990s, whom the press had dubbed \\"Alexis of Polish mining\\" or \\"Alexis of Silesia\\", after the money/power-hungry \\"Alexis Carrington\\" character on the then-popular prime-time soap Dynasty. Following her 2005 arrest for corrupting public officials involved with the so-called \\"coal mafia\\", Kmiecik allegedly named a number of officials, including Barbara Blida, although the authorities did not release any names, nor details of Kmiecik's revelations. On the early morning of Wednesday, 25 April 2007, representatives of ABW (Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego [Agency of Internal Security]) entered Blida's house in Siemianowice ≈ölƒÖskie with a prosecutor's warrant to arrest her and search the house for evidence. According to ABW reports, during the search, she asked for permission to use the bathroom, where she shot herself through the heart using her Astra 680 revolver, with subsequent resuscitation efforts by ABW agents proving to be fruitless.  Aftermath  Barbara Blida, who was 57 years old at the time of her suicide, became the top news item in the Polish media that day, and sparked many comments and controversies, which were also voiced during a special Sejm session. ABW was accused of unprofessional handling of the matter, especially for not ascertaining that Blida relinquished the weapon, since it was public knowledge that she was granted a permit for and owned one after threats on her life in previous years. Some sources also purported that her death could not come as a result of planned suicide, but rather from a scuffle with ABW agents, an accusation promptly dismissed by the officials. Opposition leaders subsequently called for the resignation of Minister Zbigniew Wassermann, the Secret Services Coordinator, but during a hearing in the Sejm he announced he had no intentions of resigning and stated that Prime Minister Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski should, instead, suspend the chief of ABW.

Her art refers directly to her country and her Dreamings. Petyarre's paintings have occasionally been compared to the works of American Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, and even to those of J.M.W. Turner. She has won several awards and is considered one of the \\"most collectable artists in Australia\\". Her works are in great demand at auctions. Petyarre died on 24 November 2018, in Alice Springs, Australia.Christine Judith Nicholls (2018) \\"Kathleen Petyarre: a brilliant artist whose life was rudely interrupted by colonisers\\" The Conversation, November 26, 2018. Accessed November 26, 2018. Background Kathleen Petyarre was born at Atnangkere, an important water soakage for Aboriginal people on the western boundary of Utopia Station, 240 km (150 miles) north- east of Alice Springs in Australia's Northern Territory. She belonged to the Alyawarre/Eastern Anmatyerre clan and spoke Eastern Anmatyerre, with English as her second language. Petyarre was the niece of the influential Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye and had several sisters who are also well-known artists in their own right, among them Gloria, Violet, Myrtle and Jeanna Petyarre. Kathleen, with her daughter Margaret and her sisters, settled at Iylenty (Mosquito Bore) at Utopia Station, near her birthplace. Petyarre was introduced to the batik medium at a hippy commune on a visit to Wollongong, New South Wales, and began making her own batik in 1977 with the support and encouragement of the linguist and adult education instructor Jenny Green. Petyarre continued to produce batiks with other women at Utopia until the late 1980s, when, prompted by allergies to the chemicals they were using, she began developing her signature style painting with acrylic on canvas. Style Petyarre's technique consisted of layering very fine dots of thin acrylic paint onto the canvas, evoking the Aboriginal custom of ceremonial body painting, to carefully construct abstract landscapes that reveal a remarkable depth when viewed up close. The dots are used to represent, among other things, flowers and spinifex, or animated clouds of sand, hail or even bush seeds. Meanwhile, various shapes and colours are used to depict geographical features such as sand-hills, watercourses and rockholes. Her imagery has been described as ‚Äúsimultaneously macro- and microcosmic‚Äù. Most of Petyarre's paintings detail the journeys of her Dreaming Ancestor, Arnkerrth, the Old Woman Mountain Devil, and are indicative of the Aborigines' traditional land navigation skills. She adopted an aerial view typical of her region's artworks to reconstruct memorised landscapes and express her Dreamings as ‚Äúa barely tangible, shadowy palimpsest, overwritten, as it were, by the surface colours and movement‚Äù. She described her paintings as ‚Äúlike looking down on my country during the hot time, when the country changes colour... I love to make the painting like it‚Äôs moving, travelling, but it‚Äôs still our body painting, still our ceremony.‚Äù From about 2003‚Äì2004, Petyarre's style became bolder, with clusters of larger dots and stronger lines alongside the very fine textures for which the artist is known. While this style was decried in some quarters as being less refined, it has also been hailed as a logical artistic development towards a more powerful and dramatic mode of expression, \\"perhaps more abstract, certainly more modern in its technicality and presentation‚Äù (text Gallerie Australis, Adelaide). Reputation Petyarre's rise to international recognition began at the Aboriginal Art from Utopia exhibition at the Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi, Melbourne on 31 October 1989. Despite remaining a relative unknown for the years to follow, she surprised the art world in 1996 by selling out her first solo exhibition, Kathleen Petyarre: Storm in Atnangkere Country, at Melbourne's Alcaston House Gallery. Her considerable reputation as one of Australia's most original indigenous artists was confirmed nationally and internationally by her regular inclusion in exhibitions at well-renowned museums and galleries, including the Louvre. A book about her art, Genius of Place, was published in 2001 in conjunction with a solo exhibition of her works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney, and her paintings can be found in public and private collections all over the world. Her work was selected, along with just a handful of Aboriginal artists, for inclusion in the permanent collection of the Mus√©e du quai Branly in Paris. Controversy In 1996, Petyarre was the Overall Winner of the 13th Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards. Controversy arose in 1997 when Petyarre's estranged partner of ten years, Ray Beamish, claimed that he had been a major contributor to the winning painting, Storm in Atnangkere Country II, which currently hangs at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin. This controversy, which shook the Aboriginal art market at the time, brought attention to the communal nature of art production in her culture and resulted in a much stricter emphasis being put on the documentation of authorship in Aboriginal paintings. Her name was eventually cleared and she retained her award. Petyarre went on to criticise Beamish for appropriating ‚Äúher birthright‚Äù (her Dreaming) in his own paintings.

It was built between 1789 and 1817 to designs by the architect Mathurin Salat (1755‚Äì1822), sometimes called \\"Blanchard\\". The house was built of limestone by the Marquis de Rastignac.  History  Ch√¢teau de Rastignac Construction of the ch√¢teau was delayed by disruptions from the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. When completed, the house was decorated in the French Empire style. In 1944, fleeing Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) forces attempted to destroy the Ch√¢teau de Rastignac in retribution against the French Resistance. Using phosphorus as an accelerant, the fire burned for five days. Only the exterior limestone shell survived. After eight years the structure was stabilized and a roof placed overhead for protection. The semi-circular Ionic portico of the Ch√¢teau de Rastignac is frequently compared with Maison carr√©e d'Arlac and the South Portico of the White House, and there have been speculations about the possible influences of one house on the other. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and Ch√¢teau de Rastignac. Though James Hoban, the original White House architect, did not visit the region, the third American president, Thomas Jefferson (who had conducted architectural revisions of the White House) did visit the region and met architect Salat earlier, while serving as United States ambassador to France. Supporters of a connection posit that Thomas Jefferson, during his tour of Bordeaux in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the √âcole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture (Bordeaux Architectural College). On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Reconstruction of the ch√¢teau's interior spaces was completed in 2003 and it is now divided into seven residential apartments (five for the main building, and two for the former coach house).

It is found mainly in northern and central India. It is often found on old buildings and rocky areas. It resembles a female Indian robin but lacks the reddish vent and differs in posture and behaviour apart from being larger. In flight it bears some resemblance to thrushes and redstarts. It feeds on insects, captured mainly on the ground. It was formerly placed as the sole species in the genus Cercomela but is now included with the wheatears in the genus Oenanthe. Taxonomy and systematics The species was described by Edward Blyth in 1851 under the binomial name Saxicola fusca based on a specimen from Mathura (\\"Muttra\\" in original). The beak is slender and is slightly curved at the tip. The second primary is the longest and the 12 feathered tail is rounded. It is considered to be monotypic although Walter Koelz suggested a new subspecies ruinarum in 1939 based on a specimen from Bhopal. It was the only species of Cercomela found outside Africa and its placement was questioned in the past. Molecular phylogenetic studies in 2010 and 2012 found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the brown rock chat which is nested within the genus Oenanthe where it is placed in newer taxonomic treatments. As part of a reorganization of the species to create monotypic genera, the brown rock chat was assigned to the genus Oenanthe. In central India, the local name of Shama has been noted. Description Brown rock chats are often found near human habitation. The brown rock chat is larger than the somewhat similar looking Indian robin and is about 17 cm long. It is uniformly rufous brown with the wings and tail of a slightly darker shade. The brown on the undersides grades into a dark grey- brown vent. In flight it resembles a female blue rock thrush and is usually found singly or in pairs on old buildings or rocky areas. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. When feeding on the ground it sometimes flicks open its wings and tail. It also has a habit of slowly raising its tail slightly, fanning it and bobbing its head. They feed mainly on insects, picked off the ground. They have been known to feed late and forage on insects attracted to artificial lighting. They have a wide repertoire of calls. Nearly eight different kinds of calls have been noted and these include territorial calls, begging call, feeding call, alarm call, threat call, contact call, distress call, roosting and emergence calls. The usual call is a short whistling chee delivered with a rapid bob and stretch and the alarm call is a harsh chek-check. The song is thrush like with a number of notes, often including imitations of the songs of other bird species including the yellow- eyed babbler, black-winged cuckooshrike and Tickell's blue flycatcher. Distribution The species is nearly endemic to India, distributed north of the Narmada, west to Gujarat (mainly Kutch but extending south) and east to Bengal bordered on the north by the Himalayas where it is found only until about 1300 m in the foothills. Its distribution extends into northern Pakistan where it is restricted east of the Chenab River. Although largely resident, some populations make movements in response to weather. In the foothills of the Himalayas it moves higher up in summer, appear in Dehra Dun in spring and leaving before the onset of winter. The species has been seen in Nepal. It is a common species although very patchily distributed. Breeding The breeding season extends from spring to summer and more than one brood is raised. The nest is a cup of grass, hair and clods placed in a ledge in a roadside cutting, wall or window even making use of occupied houses. The foundation of the nest is made up of pebbles and clay. The nests are guarded against intruders and the parents will chase palm squirrels and other birds that approach too close. The usual clutch is three to four pale blue eggs which are incubated by the female alone. The young leave the nest after about two weeks after hatching.

Witherby, Rev. F.C.R. Jourdain, Norman F. Ticehurst and Bernard W. Tucker, published in five volumes by H. F. & G. Witherby between 1938‚Äì1941. The Handbook The Handbook, as it was often cited, was itself a much enlarged and revised version of H.F. Witherby's Practical Handbook of British Birds (published between 1919 and 1924 as two volumes in three parts). Some of the plates were by Marinus Adrianus Koekkoek the Younger and were licensed after they were painted for Ornithologia Neerlandica, de vogels van Nederland by Eduard Daniel van Oort (published 1922-1935). The Handbook was reprinted a number of times, until at least the eight impression in 1958. The later printings (they were not described as new editions) having a few pages devoted to \\"additions and corrections\\" to previous \\"impressions\\", but few of these are of great significance. In only a few cases was the main text correspondingly corrected. Eventually, it was superseded by The Birds of the Western Palearctic. Reception The first volume of the first edition, that was published in 1938, received a positive reception in The Auk. G.M.A. wrote that the new handbook was a work \\"which cannot fail to find immediate approval and extensive use by ornithologist, whether professional or amateur, on both sides of the water, as a convenient and authorative reference book on birds of the western palearctic region.\\" Popular Handbook of British Birds A single- volume concise edition, The Popular Handbook of British Birds was produced by Philip Hollom in 1952. It used descriptions drawn from the Handbook and updated accounts of their status and distribution. Revised editions appeared in 1955, 1962, 1968 and 1988. These editions were far more heavily revised than those of the original Handbook, not least to take account of changes in bird taxonomy, as described in each edition's new forward. Fourth edition (SBN 85493 002 7) The 1968 edition complied with the then-new British Ornithologists' Union checklist, and incorporated further research by J. L. F. Parslow. Its 511 numbered pages described 330 species. The eggs of all breeding species were illustrated, at life size, mostly in colour Fifth edition () Produced in 1988, this was the first edition not to include the forewords from preceding editions. The entire text was reset, the status and distribution accounts were again revised, and the species sorted into the then-current taxonomic order, ending with the buntings. The jacket illustration showed blue tit, coal tit and long-tailed tit, with a great spotted woodpecker on the spine, and was by Norman Arlott. 350 species were described. It ran to 486 numbered pages. Popular Handbook of Rarer British birds Hollom also produced the supplemental The Popular Handbook of Rarer British Birds, in 1960. It described over 100 species omitted, on the grounds of their scarcity in Britain, from the Popular Handbook, about 30 of which had not occurred there at the time of the original Handbook. New plates were specially commissioned from David Reid-Henry (and one, of a Baikal teal, by Peter Scott), to add to those re-used from the Handbook.

He was influenced by Plato and Hegel, as well as by earlier Confucian thought.  Biography  Tang, the son of a wealthy scholar, was the first born of six children in Sichuan, China. Tang was briefly a student of Liang Shuming before transferring to National Central University. In 1927, Tang became a follower of Xiong Shili after attending a series of lectures. He graduated from National Central University in 1933, soon after becoming a lecturer there. In 1940, Tang met his colleague and lifelong friend Mou Zongsan. In 1943 he married Tse Ting Kwong, an educational psychology graduate. 1944 he joined the National Central University Philosophy Department as a full-time professor, and later he even became head of the department. Only five years later, in 1949, Tang left Mainland China to live in Hong Kong, as part of an exodus of Chinese intellectuals to the British colony. Tang went into exile in Hong Kong in 1949, after the declaration of the People's Republic of China, living there for the rest of his life. There he helped found the New Asia College, which was integrated into the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1963. He served as the founding chairman and the first Chair Professor of the Department of Philosophy of CUHK. Tang's time in Hong Kong was marked by his mission to salvage traditional Chinese culture in a time when China was ruled by an anti- traditionalist government.Yin, C. H. (2018). The Experiences and Participation of Immigrant Intellectuals in the Cultural Development of Hong Kong: A Study of Tang Junyi. China Report, 54(1), 48‚Äì65. https://doi.org/10.1177/0009445517744407 He established New Asia College, which to Tang symbolized his ambitious plan to save Chinese culture. Tang was particularly fixated on the fact that New Asia College was established exactly 2500 years after the birth of Confucius, often claiming that the timing was not merely coincidental, but significant as it marked a new era in Chinese history. In the 1970s, he became one of the members of the school board of New Asia Middle School. His work has mainly been influential in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States. In 2009, a bronze statue was erected in the New Asia College campus to celebrate his centenary.  Philosophy  Tang is most associated with New Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism. In his study of Contemporary New Ru Learning, Fang Keli identified Tang as part of the second generation of New Confucians, along with Mou Zongsan and Xu Fuguan.Swain, Tony. Confucianism in China: an Introduction. Bloomsbury Academic, an Imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 2017. Chapter 9. In 1958 Tang, Mou, Xu, and Zhang Zhunmai co-authored A Manifesto on Chinese Culture Respectfully Announced to the People of the World. The manifesto was an effort to revive Confucianism likely directed at Chinese people who favored adopting Western values. Tang believed the message of Confucianism was the affirmation of human life as it exists. He contrasts Confucianism with Christianity and Buddhism, religions that promote human transcendence over the physical world or the acceptance as the physical world as an illusion, respectfully.Chan, Sin Yee. ‚ÄúTang Junyi: Moral Idealism and Chinese Culture.‚Äù Contemporary Chinese Philosophy, edited by Chung-ying Cheng and Nicholas Bunnin, Blackwell Publishers, 2002. While Tang advocated for a new embrace of Confucianism, he never promoted specific political orders associated with Confucianism, nor did he propose any new political order based on his philosophies. Instead, Tang examined existing political alternatives through a Confucian lens. Liberal democracy was the political order most consistent with Confucianism because they both rest upon the idea that all humans are endowed with equal humanity. Tang's work primarily deals with three issues: traditional Chinese philosophy, ethics and metaphysics (the two of which are fundamentally intertwined in his work), and Chinese culture.  Culture  Tang devoted much of his career to exploring how to modernize China without compromising its defining traditional values. Tang saw the individual‚Äôs connection to traditional values as the way of maintaining an authentic life that would otherwise be by threatened by the emptiness of modernity.  Chinese pilosophy  With regards to the question of the individual's relation to the universe, Tang concludes that regardless of one‚Äôs approach, the individual and the universe are two different expressions of one ultimate harmony.T'ang Ch√ºn-i. \\"The Individual and the World in Chinese Methodology\\". Philosophy East and West, vol. 14, no. 3/4, 1964, pp. 293‚Äì310. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1397507. In other words, distinctions between the two are always complementary in creating the harmonious whole of existence. He argues that the lack of a dualist distinction as truth is a defining trait of Chinese philosophy. Tang was among the most prominent advocates of Neo-Confucianism in the 20th Century (not to be confused with New Confucianism, which Tang was also part of). One major difference between Tang and the original Neo-Confucianists is that Tang framed his work through contrasts with Western philosophy. For example, Tang‚Äôs concept of the heart-mind, a single entity responsible for cognition, emotion, and will, is an originally Neo-Confucian idea. Tang argued that the heart-mind is the key to all human understanding in his 1977 book Life, Existence, and the Horizons of the Heart-Mind.  Ethics and Metaphysics  In his book Heart-Mind, Objects, and Human Life, Tang argues that the alienation experienced by people in modern societies is strongly connected to an emphasis on abstractions over concrete realities of everyday life. Tang concludes that the metaphysical world has moral qualities because virtues help people to align themselves harmoniously with the universe. In his approach to ethics, Tang distinguishes the actual and the ethical self. The ethical self is informed by reason in order to transcend the actual self. While the actual self is bound spatially and temporally, the rational ethical self is a permanent entity in accord with truth. This is why Tang identifies the ethical self, not the actual self, as being the genuine self. Tang attempted to systematize the moral idealism in his final book Life, Existence, and the Horizons of the Heart-Mind in 1977. He argues that the human heart-mind, the source of cognition, emotion, and will, is key to understanding the world, and that in integrating of reason and emotion, the heart-mind can respond correctly in a given situation. The other main point of this book is the Nine Horizons, the spheres of existence that human activity engages with. The first three horizons are the objective world as perceived by heart-mind. The first horizon separates individuals. The second horizon separates categories. The third horizon identifies sequences, such as cause and effect or means and ends. The middle three horizons are concerned with self-reflection. The fourth horizon is the understanding of mutual perception between individuals. The fifth horizon is the understanding of symbols and meaning, including but not limited to mathematics and language. The sixth horizon is the understanding of moral conduct, which realizes the ideals we hold. Last three horizons unify the subjective and the objective in an effort to create value in our lives (what Tang calls the trans-subjective-objective horizons). The seventh horizon is the realization of a Monotheistic God. The eighth horizon is the realization of the emptiness of the self and of dharma. The ninth horizon is the flowing of Heavenly Virtue. Tang intentionally incorporated Abrahamic, Buddhist, and Confucian ideas of virtue into these last three horizons.  NotesReferences and further reading * Brill Open Access e-book.

During World War II, having provided refuge for the assassins of SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich, called The Hangman of Prague, in the cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague, Gorazd took full responsibility for protecting the patriots after the Schutzstaffel found them in the crypt of the cathedral. This act guaranteed his execution, thus his martyrdom, during the reprisals that followed. His feast day is celebrated on 22 August (OC) or 4 September (NC).  Life  Matƒõj Pavl√≠k was born on 26 May 1879, in the Moravian village of Hrub√° Vrbka in what would later be the Czech Republic. Born into the Roman Catholic society of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Matthias entered the Faculty of Theology in Olomouc after finishing his earlier education. He was subsequently ordained a priest. During his studies, he was interested in the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius and of Eastern Orthodoxy. Establishment of Czechoslovakia in the aftermath of the First World War brought complete religious freedom. In this environment, many people left the Catholic Church. While many left the religion completely, some looked either to old Czech Protestant churches or, as Pavl√≠k, to Eastern Orthodoxy. The Serbian Orthodox Church provided a shelter for those looking to Orthodoxy. As a leader in Moravia, the Serbian Orthodox Church agreed to consecrate Fr. Pavl√≠k to the episcopate for his homeland. On 24 September 1921, he was consecrated bishop with the name of Gorazd. Historically, his monastic name of Gorazd was significant as it was the name of the bishop who succeeded St. Methodius as Bishop of Moravia after he died in 885. Subsequently, Pope Stephen V drove the disciples of St Methodius from Moravia as the Latin rite was imposed. Thus, by the choice of his monastic name of Gorazd, the continuity of the Orthodox Church in Moravia from some 1,100 years before was recognized. Archimandrite Gorazd was named Bishop of Moravia and Silesia on 24 September 1921, and consecrated bishop on the next day at the Cathedral of the Holy Archangel Michael in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, by Serbian Patriarch Dimitrije. Over the next decade or so, Bp. Gorazd and his faithful followers organized parishes and built churches in Bohemia. In all they built eleven churches and two chapels. He had the essential service books translated and published in the Czech language, which was the language used in the church services. With Carpathian Ruthenia and Slovakia part of Czechoslovakia, he assisted many who had returned to their ancestral Eastern Orthodox faith, thus helping the creation of the Eparchy of Mukaƒçevo and Pre≈°ov in 1931. With the conquest of Czechoslovakia by the Nazis in 1938, the church was placed under the Metropolitan in Berlin, Germany. Reinhard Heydrich was appointed as ruler of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On 27 May 1942, a group of Czech resistance fighters assassinated Heydrich. In making their escape, the group found refuge in the crypt of the Cathedral. When Bp. Gorazd found out a few days later, he recognized the serious burden this placed on the Czech Orthodox Church. Before he left for the consecration to the episcopate of Fr John (Gardner) in Berlin, he asked that the resistance fighters move elsewhere as soon as possible. However, on June 18, the Nazis found the hiding places after a betrayal by two members of the resistance group, and all the members of the group were killed. Reprisals came quickly. The two priests and the senior lay church officials were arrested. Bp. Gorazd, wishing to help his fellow believers and the Czech Church itself, took the blame for the actions in the Cathedral on himself, even writing letters to the Nazi authorities. On 27 June 1942, he was arrested and tortured. On 4 September 1942, Bp. Gorazd, the Cathedral priests and the lay officials were executed by firing squad at Kobylisy Shooting Range. His body was disposed of at Stra≈°nice Crematorium.Riskoval ≈æivot, tajnƒõ zapisoval jm√©na obƒõt√≠ nacist≈Ø. Teƒè o tom promluvil The reprisals went much further as the Nazis conducted widespread roundups of Czechs, including the whole village of Lidice, then summarily killed the men and children, while they placed the women in concentration camps. The Orthodox churches in Moravia and Bohemia were closed and the Church forbidden to operate. Metropolitan Seraphim courageously refused to issue any statement condemning Bishop Gorazd. It was not until the end of the war that the Orthodox Church in Czechoslovakia would function again.  Glorification  Icon.

On 4 May 1961, the Serbian Orthodox Church recognized Bp. Gorazd as a new martyr, and on 24 August 1987, he was glorified in the Olomouc Orthodox Church in Moravia.

In contrast to bilateral aid provided by the US Government to Micronesia's public sector through the Compact of Free Association , Habele targets support for local schools and civil society, emphasizing competition, incentives, and ownership in order to \\"change attitudes and expectations\\" among community members.\\" \\"Habele Outer Island Education Fund provides scholarships for FSM \\"outer islanders\\"\\" The Kaselehlie Press, September 10, 2013. Tuition scholarships The fund awards scholarships to students attending primary and secondary private schools and provides material donations to small public schools. In the first year of operation $2,890 in scholarships were awarded. Scholarships for 2007-08 exceeded $3,500. The issuance of scholarships in 2008-09, exceeding $5,000, was described by the Peace Corps Micronesia Country Director as \\"particularly important\\" for expanding education opportunities because students living outside Micronesia's four state capitals have very limited access to formal education options. A total of 21 scholarships were issued for the 2010-11 school year. South Carolina State Senators Glenn McConnell and Robert Ford of Charleston, South Carolina drew attention to Habele, when the charity announced $7,500 in scholarships for sixteen elementary and high school students in 2009. Louis J. Rama, a senior consul at the Federated States of Micronesia Consulate on Guam, called for the expansion of this and other programs supporting low-income students through tuition assistance. The donor-financed tuition payments awarded by Habele are a form of private vouchers. Unlike public school vouchers, private vouchers are not funded by the government. The use of private vouchers for low-income students has been described as a tool for facilitating education reform without becoming immersed in politics. Language Early in 2010, Habele announced plans to develop and distribute native language materials for educators and students in the outer islands of Yap State, Micronesia. The initial project was a Ulithian to English dictionary. This was the first rigorous documentation of the Ulithian language and copies were provided to educators and students throughout Ulithi and Fais. The authors' stated aim was to create a consistent and intuitive pattern of Roman alphabet spelling useful for native Ulithian and native English speakers. Libraries and literacy Donations to schools generally consist of books, school supplies, and classroom instructional materials. Habele has played a major role in the creation of libraries on the isolated atolls of Ulithi and Eauripik. English language dictionaries have also been provided to students, including a 1,000 dictionary donation in the Fall of 2012 intended to equip every middle school student throughout Yap State with a personal dictionary for home and classroom use.  Extracurricular Habele also supports programs that engage students outside the traditional classroom. These include financial and material support for the creation of traditional dugout canoes by high school aged boys. as well as creation of after school clubs for robotics competitions between high schools In May 2012, Oceania's first ever Vex Robot competition was held in the State of Yap. Teams representing Yap Catholic High School and the Yap Seventh-Day Adventist School completed a public competition and demonstrated using robotics kits donated by Habele. By 2017, the league had grown to the point where a team from Yap represented all of Micronesia at the FIRST Global international robotics competition in Washington, D.C.

Kuwait's Christians can be divided into 2 groups. The first group are Christians who are native Kuwaitis numbering approximately between 200 and 400 people. The second group, who make up the majority of Christians in Kuwait, are expatriates from various countries around the world. There are also a number of believers in Christ from a Muslim background in the country, though many are not citizens. A 2015 study estimates some 350 such Christians in the country that are ex-Muslim. Kuwaiti Christians Kuwait's native Christian population is diverse. There are between 259 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens. In 2014, there were 259 Christian Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait. Latest estimates in December 2019 put the community at 290 with the slight increase most likely a result of a return of a few Kuwaiti Christian emigrants. Christian Kuwaitis can be divided into two groups. The first group includes the earliest, who were Iraqi Christian (Assyrian/Chaldean) and Turkish Christian (Antiochian Greek) immigrants and their local-born descendants. They have assimilated into Kuwaiti society, like their Muslim counterparts, and tend to speak Arabic with a Kuwaiti dialect; their food and culture are also predominantly Kuwaiti. The make up less than a quarter of Kuwait's Christian population. The rest (roughly three-quarters) of Christian Kuwaitis make up the second group. They are more recent arrivals in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Kuwaitis of Palestinian ancestry who were forced out of Palestine after 1948. There are also smaller numbers who originally hail from Syria and Lebanon. This second group is not as assimilated as the first group, as their food, culture, and Arabic dialect still retain a Levant feel. However, they are just as patriotic as the former group, and tend to be proud of their adopted homeland, with many serving in the army, police, civil, and foreign service. Most of Kuwait's citizen Christians belong to 12 large families, with the Shammas (from Turkey) and the Shuhaibar (from Palestine) families being some of the more prominent ones. Although there is a small community of Christian citizens, a law passed in 1981 prevents the naturalization of non-Muslims. However, male citizens who were Christians before 1980 (and male children born to families of such citizens since that date), can transmit their citizenship to their children; however, they cannot transmit their citizenship to their spouses. Kuwait is the only GCC country besides Bahrain to have a local Christian population who hold citizenship.http://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2016/12/27/An-inside- look-at-a-Gulf-Christian-community.html# Traditionally, Eastern Orthodox Christians in Kuwait belong to the jurisdiction of Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. Eastern Orthodox parish in Kuwait was reorganized in 1969 by late metropolitan Constantine Papastephanou of Baghdad and Kuwait (1969-2014), who visited Kuwait on many occasions.Memory Eternal: Metropolitan Constantine (Papastephanou) His successor is Metropolitan Ghattas Hazim of Baghdad and Kuwait (since 2014). His official seat remains in Baghdad, but administrative headquarters of the Archdiocese are located in Kuwait.

Maronite Christians, mostly from Lebanon, also worship at the Catholic cathedral in Kuwait City. A small group of Catholics are from Europe and the Americas. * 200,000 Orthodox Christians, at least. The Greek Orthodox Church has about 3,500 members, while the Armenian Orthodox Church has about 4,000 members. The Coptic Orthodox Church has about 60,000 members. Totals for both the Greek Catholic (Eastern Rite) Church membership and Indian Orthodox Church membership more than 60,000.The Ethiopian and Russian Orthodox Churches, has a membership of 70,000.

The legislation was proposed shortly after Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Grand Mufti Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh. Kuwaiti officials later clarified the legislation would not remove the churches already existing, but prohibit further construction of Christian churches and non-Muslim places of worship in the country. Article 2 of the Constitution of Kuwait states Islam is the state religion and that Sharia (Islamic Law) shall be a main source of legislation, and as a consequence proselytization of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.

The result was a victory for the ruling Dominica Labour Party, which won 12 of the 21 seats in the House of Assembly. The opposition United Workers' Party unsuccessfully made legal challenges to several of the constituency results. Background In the previous 2000 elections the ruling United Workers' Party won one fewer seats than the Dominica Labour Party, despite receiving more votes. As a result, the Dominica Labour Party with 10 seats was able to form a coalition government with the Dominica Freedom Party, which had won two seats. In 2004 Prime Minister Pierre Charles died and was succeeded by Minister of Education Roosevelt Skerrit. Campaign On 7 April Skerrit announced that the elections would take place on 5 May. Altogether 47 candidates stood in the elections; 21 candidates from the United Workers' Party, 19 from the Dominica Labour Party, 3 from the Dominica Progressive Party, 2 from the Dominica Freedom Party and 2 independents. Just under 66,000 voters were registered to vote in the election at 249 polling stations spread over the 21 constituencies. Major elections issues included an International Monetary Fund austerity economic plan for Dominica and the Dominica Labour Party government's decision to switch recognition from the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the People's Republic of China. On the Monday before the election, there was an incident when motorcades for the two main parties collided with each other. No major injuries resulted and rallies for each party were held afterwards. The police then refused either party permission to hold motorcades on the day before the election. The campaign was judged as being particularly long and divisive, with the election seen as very close and likely to come down to voter turnout. Opinion polls A poll in February predicted that the United Workers' Party would win 12 seats, compared to 7 for the Dominica Labour Party and 2 for the Dominica Freedom Party. However another poll in March had the Dominica Labour Party winning 12 seats, the United Workers' Party 7 seats and the Dominica Freedom Party 2 seats. Results Results by constituency The Dominica Labour Party increased their number of seats from 10 to 12, obtaining a majority. The United Workers' Party lost one seat, one independent candidate was elected, whilst the Dominica Freedom Party lost both its seats. It was the first election in 35 years where the Dominica Freedom Party‚Äîthe governing party of Eugenia Charles from 1980 to 1995‚Äîdid not win any seats. Prime Minister Skerrit announced that the day after the election would be a national holiday and called for Dominica to unite behind the government after the elections. Aftermath Following the elections, the United Workers' Party made legal challenges to the results of five constituencies, Castle Bruce, Soufriere, Mahaut, St Joseph and Carib Territory alleging that there were problems with the counts and that the results were rigged by the government. Initial counts in the Castle Bruce constituency had the United Workers' Party candidate ahead but the final result saw the Dominica Labour Party win by one vote. Opposition supporters protested the results outside of the government headquarters in Roseau. On the 28 October 2005 the legal challenges were dismissed by a High Court Justice, Hugh Rawlins. The appeals court also rejected the lawsuit in April 2006 and the United Workers' Party then dropped the challenges.

It is owned by Cincinnati Public Radio, which also operates station WGUC and WMUB. It airs public radio news/talk syndicated programming from National Public Radio, American Public Media and Public Radio International. History, union with WGUC The station was originally licensed to Xavier University; it featured primarily a jazz format. It became an NPR member when the network's Morning Edition debuted, circa 1979-1980. The original NPR member for the Cincinnati area, WGUC, did not want to replace its popular morning drive-time classical music show with the newsmagazine, so WVXU started carrying Morning Edition and other NPR programs. WGUC continued carrying NPR's flagship afternoon newsmagazine, All Things Considered. Over time, WVXU added more news and spoken-word programs to supplement its music schedule, coinciding with the expansion of NPR's schedule in the 1980s. While WGUC and WVXU between them provided most of the NPR programs available to a single market, the two NPR flagship newsmagazines aired separately. On August 22, 2005, Xavier transferred WVXU and its \\"X-Star Network\\" of translator stations to CPRI, bringing the station and WGUC under the same licensee. This permitted elimination of program duplication and a realignment of formats. WGUC transferred nearly all of its remaining spoken-word programming, including All Things Considered, to WVXU. WGUC now airs classical music almost exclusively, while WVXU carries news and information programs, including both NPR flagship newsmagazines, along with some jazz and blues music programs on weekend evenings. On March 1, 2009, Cincinnati Public Radio took over management of WMUB, which is licensed to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. As part of the deal, Miami retained ownership of the station serving southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana, though it is now a full-time satellite of WVXU. WMUB brings WVXU's programming to areas north of Cincinnati where the main signal is weak. Programming 91.7 WVXU/88.5 WMUB carries many of the top rated public radio programs from program providers such as NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International and PRX. In addition, a locally produced talk show, Cincinnati Edition, airs each weekday at 12:00pm. This show covers a wide range of topics from health, education, arts, politics and more. Listeners are encouraged to engage with the program by calling in, emailing, or via Facebook and Twitter. News team WVXU has a news team of five who report and host. The five are: Maryanne Zeleznik (News Director and main Morning Host), Jay Hansleman (Host/Reporter) Ann Thompson (Main Afternoon Host), Tana Weingartner (Host/Reporter), Bill Rinehart (Main Late Afternoon/Evening Host), and Ambriehl Crutchfield (Reporter). The station's website is augmented by Howard Wilkinson (Blogger and Politics Reporter), and John Kiesewetter (Media blogger.) Community events Since beginning operation of WVXU in August 2005, the station has brought in a variety of public radio hosts and programs and acts as media sponsor for various community-wide events. Examples of shows and hosts who have visited Cincinnati: live broadcasts of \\"A Prairie Home Companion,\\" \\"Whad'ya Know,\\" and \\"Talk of the Nation.\\" Recorded episode of \\"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me,\\" Visits from Ira Glass (\\"This American Life\\"), Lynne Rossetto Kasper (\\"The Splendid Table\\"), Terry Gross (\\"Fresh Air\\"), Diane Rehm (\\"The Diane Rehm Show\\"), and Carl Kasell (NPR News and \\"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\\"). Media sponsor/partner for: Books by the Banks, On the Same Page, various theater production and events. Translator network Shortly after CPRI acquired WVXU, it sold the network of translator stations (\\"X-Star\\") that Xavier had built in rural parts of Ohio and Michigan during the 1990s to provide service to those outside the clear signal of another NPR affiliate.

Orthodox icon of nine orders of angels. Baptistery in Florence depicts (in the inmost octagon of images) seven of the orders of angelic beings (all but the Seraphim and Cherubim), under which are their Latin designations. A hierarchy of angels is a belief or tradition found in the angelology of different religions, which holds that there are different levels or ranks of angels. Higher ranks may be asserted to have greater power or authority over lower ranks, and with different ranks having differences in appearance, such as varying numbers of wings or faces. Abrahamic faiths=Judaism The Jewish angelic hierarchy is established in the Hebrew Bible, Talmud, Rabbinic literature, and traditional Jewish liturgy. They are categorized in different hierarchies proposed by various theologians. For example, Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah or Yad ha-Chazakah: Yesodei ha- Torah, counts ten ranks of angels. Christianity The most influential Christian angelic hierarchy was that put forward by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in the 5th or 6th century in his book De Coelesti Hierarchia (On the Celestial Hierarchy). Dionysius described nine levels of spiritual beings which he grouped into three orders: *Highest order *:Seraphim *:Cherubim *:Thrones *Middle order *:Dominions *:Virtues *:Powers *Lowest order *:Principalities *:Archangels *:Angels During the Middle Ages, various schemes were proposed, some drawing on and expanding on Pseudo-Dionysius, others suggesting completely different classifications. Pseudo-Dionysius (On the Celestial Hierarchy) and Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae) drew on passages from the New Testament, specifically Ephesians and Colossians 1:16, to develop a schema of three Hierarchies, Spheres or Triads of angels, with each Hierarchy containing three Orders or Choirs. Islam There is no standard hierarchical organization in Islam that parallels the Christian division into different \\"choirs\\" or spheres, and the topic is not directly addressed in the Quran. However, it is clear that there is a set order or hierarchy that exists between angels, defined by the assigned jobs and various tasks to which angels are commanded by God. Some scholars suggest that Islamic angels can be grouped into fourteen categories, with some of the higher orders being considered archangels. Qazwini describes an angelic hierarchy in his Aja'ib al-makhluqat with Ruh on the head of all angels, surrounded by the four archangelic cherubim. Below them are the seven angels of the seven heavens.Mehdi Amin Razavi Aminrazavi, Seyyed Hossein Nasr The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia Routledge, 16.12.2013 p.17 Zoroastrian There is also an informal Zoroastrian angelic hierarchy, with the specific angelic beings called yazatas having key positions in the day-name dedications on the Zoroastrian calendar segregated into the ameshaspentas (the second to seventh of the 30 days of the month), yazatas and minoos (the last six of the 30 days of the month). Role- playing games Angels are occasionally presented in role-playing games as having ordered hierarchies, within which higher level angels have more power and the ability to cast more spells or exercise other magical abilities. For example, Angels in Dungeons & Dragons, a subgroup of the beings called Celestials, come in three different types, the progressively more powerful Astral Deva, Planetar, and Solar.Jon Schindehette, Celestials, Angels, Devas: Dragon's-Eye View (January 9, 2013).Christopher Perkins, Warriors of Heaven (TSR, 1999). Another game which has summonable angels is Shin Megami Tensei, often classified under Divine, or Heralds. In the game series Bayonetta angels are enemies and all 3 spheres are present, each divided in the same 3 orders as the traditional hierarchy.

Halo blight‚Äôs pathogen is a gram-negative, aerobic, polar- flagellated and non-spore forming bacteria. This bacterial disease was first discovered in the early 1920s, and rapidly became the major disease of beans throughout the world. The disease favors the places where temperatures are moderate and plentiful inoculum is available.Harveson, Robert M. \\"Halo Blight of Dry Beans in Nebraska.\\" Lincoln Extension publications (2009). Retrieved December 16, 2014.  Classification  *Kingdom: Bacteria *Phylum: Proteobacteria *Class: Gamma Proteobacteria *Order: Pseudomonadales *Family: Pseudomonadaceae *Genus: Pseudomonas *Species: P. syringae  Hosts and symptoms  Common beans in moderate temperature regions are victims of halo blights. Main hosts are lima beans, red kidney bean, cranberry yellow eye field beans, snap beans, scarlet runner, kudzu vine and common P.vulgaris.Sherf, Arden F. ‚ÄúVegetable Diseases and Their Control.‚Äù Wiley & Sons (1986): 36-41 Halo blight is affected by environment factors and enter through plant injuries or natural openings.Arnold, D.L. ‚ÄúPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola: from 'has bean' to supermodel.‚Äù Mol Plant Pathol. (2011):617‚Äì627. The development of the Halo blight is highly favored by cool temperature (such as 20‚Äì23 ¬∞C), unlike other common bacterial blights. In warm temperatures (over 24 ¬∞C), the production of phaseolotoxin decreases and symptoms become less obvious. Phaseolotoxin is a toxin produced by Halo blight pathogen which causes systemic chlorosis. Halo blight causes small water- soaked spots on leaves. These spot progressively turn dark brown and are surrounded by a wide greenish yellow halo. The necrotic spots remain small unlike that of common blight.Harveson, Robert M. ‚ÄúBacterial Diseases of Dry Edible Beans in the Central High Plains.‚Äù Plant Health Progress. (2007) doi: 10.1094/PHP-2006-0915-01-DG. Similar to foliage symptoms, halo blights causes water-soaked spots on vegetative pods. It also causes streaks along pod sutures. If lesions becomes severe on the pods, it may penetrate the pod walls or expand into the pod sutures which causes the seed to be wrinkled and discolored (yellow patches on the seed coat). Systemic infections are not common, but occur more favorably in some dry bean varieties. If the disease develops a systemic infection, it will cause curling, yellowing and death of young leaflets.Schwartz, H.F. ‚ÄúBacterial Diseases of Beans.‚Äù Colorado State University Extension. (2013):2.913  Disease cycle  The seed is a source of inoculum and pathogen survives in seeds from the previous year.Slawiak, M. ‚ÄúApplication of PCR-RFLP and simplified AFLP for differentiation of bacteria from the Pseudomonas species‚Äù Phytopathologia Polonica (2005): 85-93 The pathogen of halo blight can overwinter in previously infected bean debris, contaminated seeds, weed hosts or volunteer beans.Wohleb, H.C. ‚ÄúCommon Bacterial Blight and Halo Blight‚Äù WSU EXTENSION(2011):2-4 Halo blight can be dispersed by contact between wet leaves, rainfall, irrigation or people and animals moving through infested fields.Dillard, Helene. R. ‚ÄúBacterial Diseases of Beans‚Äù Cooperative Extension. (1991) : 729.50 The Pathogen can enter in either plant injuries or the natural openings in plants such as stomata and hydathodes during periods of high humidity or when the foliage is wet.Hirano, S.S. ‚ÄúBacteria in the leaf ecosystem with emphasis on Pseudomonas syringae : A pathogen, ice nucleus, and epiphyte.‚Äù Microbiol Mol Biol Rev (2000): 64:624-653.Jin, Q. ‚ÄúType III protein secretion in Pseudomonas syringae.‚Äù Microb Infect. (2003):301-310.Bretz, J.R. ‚ÄúRole of type III effector secretion during bacterial pathogenesis in another kingdom‚Äù Infect Immun (2004):3697-3705. Then the pathogen survives from defense mechanisms in intracellular spaces and obtain nutrients from the host. After 6‚Äì10 days of infection, bacteria oozes from lesions which causes secondary infections.Markell, S ‚ÄúBacterial Blights Showing up on Dry Beans‚Äù NDSU (2013) Mode of action Toxin phaseolotoxin is produced, which acts as an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine carbamyltransferase (OTC), an essential enzyme involved in the conversion from ornithine to arginine, an amino acid which is utilized in the biosynthesis of proteins in plants. With presence of 30 pmol phaseolotoxin, it is able to reduce OCT activity to less than 20% of the one of unaffected OCT within, leading to arginine starvation and subsequently prohibiting protein synthesis. As a result, disease symptoms appear within 2 days, where chlorotic lesions appear as yellow halos surrounding black necrotic spots on the infected plants. Environment Halo blight seems to thrive when the temperatures are cooler. The optimal temperature for Pseudomonas Syringae to thrive is 20-23 ¬∞C. Moist environments also allow the spread of this disease. The pathogen enters the plant through wounds or stomata and hydathodes during periods of high relative humidity or free moisture. Above 28 ¬∞C, symptoms will usually not develop even though some water soaked spots may be present.Schwartz, H.F. \\"Bean Production Problems in the Tropics\\" CIAT. (1989): 286-287. Rain splash can allow the disease to spread, especially when there is a prevailing wind to allow the bacteria to transmit even farther. The presence of an organism such as a human or animal can also allow for the spread of the disease. Contact from the mammal to an infected plant cause the bacteria to be carried wherever the organism goes. The mammal can spread the disease to a whole new environment and introduce the pathogen to new hosts.Agrios, George N. Plant Pathology Fifth Edition. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press, 2005, 629. Management There are plenty of methods used to stop the spread of Halo blight. These methods include the use of foliar sprays, treatments of seeds, and resistant cultivars.Taylor, J.D. \\"Epidemiology and strategy for the control of halo- blight of beans.\\" Annals of Applied Biology. (1979): 167. Seeds that are sanitized from the previous year to show no bacterial signs can be planted without the worry of spreading the pathogen. Foliar sprays are the best ways to stop the secondary spread of Halo blight. Copper is the main component of the foliar sprays which are used to contain this pathogen. The Bordeaux mixture and streptomycin are two of the main foliar sprays that have shown results when treating Halo blight.Taylor, J.D. \\"Field studies on halo-blight of beans (Pseudomonas phaseolicola) and its control by foliar sprays.\\" Annals of Applied Biology. (1972): 191. Both of these sprays contain copper which is the most used element in anti-bacterial sprays. Resistance is a very important aspect to stopping the spread of Halo blight. The testing of field resistance has helped plant pathologists understand which cultivars can be helpful in defending against this disease. A resistant cultivar called Pse-2 had a high breeding value against multiple races of the pathogen.Miklas, Phillip N. \\"Genetic Characterization and Molecular Mapping Pse-2 Gene for Resistance to Halo Blight in Common Bean.\\" American Society of Agronomy. (2011): 2439. All of these actions can help eradicate this bacterial pathogen from spreading to more crop areas.  Importance  Halo Blight is an important disease to beans, a money crop, which allow the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae to continue its lifespan. Beans are only one cash crop that can be affected by halo blight. Fields that are affected by this bacteria are at risk for the spread of it by way of rain, wind, or organisms but a widespread infection isn‚Äôt common with the cultural practices that are now used. In 1963-1967 there were many precautions taken and irrigation practices used but the effect of the environmental conditions caused epidemics in Idaho beans.Butcher, C.L. \\"Effectiveness of Halo blight control in Idaho bean seed crops.\\" (1969): 894-896. The disease triangle illustrates this idea by emphasizing the importance of pathogen, host, and environment.  Cure  As noted above, there are many procedures that can be used to manage an infection of Pseudomonas syringae but there is no cure and crop destruction is the usual procedure.

Members history and friendships The Regulators were formed out of numerous small ranch owners and cowboys in the Lincoln, New Mexico area. Many of those who became best known as \\"Regulators\\" had a long history with one another previously. William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid or Henry McCarty, would become the best known, mostly because news accounts attached his name to everything the Regulators did. The Lincoln County War brought him to the front, but several of the other Regulators were actually the driving force behind the events, and had a history of killing alongside one another prior to the war. Ab Saunders, Charlie Bowdre, Doc Scurlock, Frank Coe, and George Coe had previously killed rustlers together. On July 18, 1876, that group had stormed the Lincoln jail, removing horse thief Jesus Largo, and hanged him. Ab Saunders and Frank Coe had tracked down cattle rustler Nicos Meras, shooting and killing him that same month in the Baca Canyon. Their association with McCarty began when, in the spring of 1876, Henry (at the time known as either Henry Antrim or William Bonney) moved to Lincoln County and began working for Doc Scurlock and Charlie Bowdre at their cheese factory. He later worked, for a time, for rancher Henry Hooker, and then for Ab Saunders and the Coes on their ranch. By the time the Lincoln County War came along, those main core members, referred to as the \\"iron clad\\", were all more experienced and closer to being actual \\"gunmen\\" than was McCarty. Formation and notoriety The Lincoln County War began when a posse of men, deputized by Sheriff William J. Brady, murdered young Englishman John Henry Tunstall on February 18, 1878. The posse had ostensibly been chasing Tunstall to attach, i.e., seize by legal authority, some stock Tunstall and his men were driving from Tunstall‚Äôs ranch on the Feliz River to Lincoln, but the posse‚Äôs real motivation was clear ‚Äì eliminate John Tunstall as an economic threat to businessmen James Dolan and L.G. Murphy, who had Sheriff Brady in their control. Tunstall's ranch-hands and other local citizens formed a group known as the Regulators to avenge his murder, and counter what they viewed as a corrupt territorial criminal justice system controlled by allies of Murphy, Dolan, and company. The Regulators obtained their legality from the authority of the Justice of the Peace of the town of Lincoln, John B. Wilson. Justice of the Peace Wilson issued warrants for the arrests of John Tunstall's killers, and appointed Regulator Dick Brewer a Special Constable to execute the warrants. Additionally, Regulator Robert Widenmann, who previously secured an appointment as a Deputy U.S. Marshal, was given permission to form a civilian posse and arrest the accused. The Lincoln County War and the Regulators would launch Billy the Kid to everlasting fame. It is probable that in reality other Regulators, for example Doc Scurlock, were closer to actually being \\"gunmen\\" than Billy. It is likely that in some cases, Billy the Kid was credited with killings that in fact were carried out by other Regulators. By the Regulators' end, any killings committed by them had his name appended, whether he was the actual shooter or not. This would eventually be detrimental to his attempts at amnesty. The Regulators would go through three different leaders, all but one being killed. Although Billy the Kid would achieve fame as a member of the Regulators, he never led them. Their first leader was Richard \\"Dick\\" Brewer, killed later by Buckshot Roberts and replaced by Frank McNab, who was killed by members of the Seven Rivers Warriors. McNab was replaced by the Regulators final leader, Doc Scurlock. William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, never made any effort to become well known, or to be the main subject of news reports on the events taking place during the range war.

Seven Rivers members Tom Green, Charles Marshall, Jim Patterson and John Galvin are killed that same day, and although the Regulators are blamed, their involvement was never proven. Seven Rivers gang members at that time were beginning to turn on one another. * May 15, The Regulators gained some revenge by storming the area around Seven Rivers, capturing and killing Manuel Segovia, the cowboy who had killed Frank McNab. * July 15, the Regulators were surrounded in Lincoln at the McSween house. Facing them were the Dolan/Murphy/Seven Rivers cowboys. * July 19, the house was set afire. As the flames spread and night fell, Susan McSween was granted safe passage out of the house while the men inside continued to fight the fire. By 9 o'clock, those left inside got set to break out the back door of the burning house. Jim French went out first, followed by Billy the Kid, Tom O'Folliard, and Jose Chavez y Chavez. The Dolan men saw the running men and opened fire, killing Harvey Morris, Alexander McSween's law partner. Some troopers moved into the back yard to take those left into custody when a close-order gunfight erupted. Alex McSween was killed, as was Seven Rivers cowboy Bob Beckwith. With McSween dead the war was over. Aftermath Ultimately, the Lincoln County War accomplished little other than to foment distrust and animosity in the area and to make fugitives out of the surviving Regulators, most notably Billy the Kid. The Kid, Scurlock, Bowdre, Chavez y Chavez, Waite, Saunders, Brewer, Brown, McNab and the Coe cousins received the most notoriety as being \\"Regulators\\". Gradually, his fellow gunmen scattered to their various fates, and Billy the Kid was left with Charlie Bowdre, Tom O'Folliard, Dirty Dave Rudabaugh, and a few other friends with whom he rustled cattle and committed other petty crimes while negotiating for an amnesty that would never come, and evading capture.  Post-War Careers  * Ab Saunders died in 1884, in San Francisco, California, during surgery to correct problems he still suffered due to his wound received on April 29, 1878. * Fred Waite headed back to what is now present-day Oklahoma where, as a member of the Chickasaw Nation, he settled down as a rancher, and ultimately went into politics. * Frank and George Coe moved around for a time, eventually returning to Lincoln, where they became highly respected citizens, and successful ranchers. * Jose Chavez y Chavez eventually became a police officer, but became involved in a murder for hire, for which he spent time in prison. After his release he lived a seemingly quiet life until dying in 1924. * Robert A. Widenmann's post-New Mexico career took him to Great Britain, where he visited Tunstall's family, and to Haverstraw, N.Y. where he died on April 13, 1930 at the age of 78. * Doc Scurlock moved to Texas, where he became a respected citizen in both Potter County, Texas and Eastland County, Texas, dying at the age of 79. Most of the some 40 plus Regulators were relative unknowns and their whereabouts after the war ended is lost to history. Popular culture * The Regulators were featured in the movie Young Guns, which only featured seven members. * Two groups of gun-slinging self-appointed lawmen known as the \\"Regulators\\", one a band of tyrannical raiders based in the West Coast and one a loose association of DC bounty-hunters, can also be found in the computer game series Fallout. * The Lincoln County Regulators are a popular bluegrass/folk band based in Scotland.

Carlos Miguel Buela on March 25, 1984. The institute is a Clerical InstituteCan. 588 ¬ß2. Code of Canon Law, (Holy See: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1983), https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM of Consecrated Life of Diocesan Right which includes both priests and religious brothers of either apostolic or contemplative life. The institute is the male branch of the Religious Family of the Incarnate Word: a union of religious institutes founded by Fr. Buela. The other two branches are the female religious community known as the Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matar√° (SSVM) and the Secular Third Order. In December 2016, the institute's founder, Carlos Buela, was sentenced by a Vatican Tribunal of sexual misconduct with IVE seminarians and was forced to cut off all contact with members of the Institute while living his sentence doing penance and prayer.  Overview  Members of the Institute profess the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. In addition, a fourth vow of Marian slavery is professed following the practice of St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort.  History = Foundation  Fr. Carlos Miguel Buela, IVE celebrates Mass for missionaries of the Institute of the Incarnate Word in Canada. Fr. Carlos Miguel Buela founded the Institute of the Incarnate Word in Argentina on March 25, 1984, on the Solemnity of the Annunciation with the approval of Bishop Le√≥n Kruk in the Diocese of San Rafael. A few years later, in 1988, Fr. Buela founded the female branch, the Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matar√°, with the same charism and mission. After passing almost two decades in the initial stages as a new religious community, the IVE became a religious congregation of diocesan right on May 8, 2004 under the guidance of resident diocesan Bishop Andrea Maria Erba of the Diocese of Velletri-Segni near Rome, Italy, the site of the institute's main house. At the same time the Constitutions also received official approval by a competent authority of the Church. Mons. Erba had previously received the institute's General House in the year 2000. On March 25, 2009 the Institute celebrated its 25th Anniversary of foundation, and a year later saw the election of a new General Superior, Fr. Carlos Walker, IVE, after the retirement of Fr. Carlos Buela, IVE.  Specific locations = United States  The first IVE priests to come to the United States arrived in New York in December 1989, the SSVM sisters arriving shortly thereafter. Several years later, given its rapid growth, the IVE officially established the Province of the Immaculate Conception which includes the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Guyana. The Institute began its American novitiate (St. Isaac Jogues & Companion Martyrs Novitiate) in 1998, its seminary (the Ven. Fulton Sheen House of Formation) in 1999, and a high school seminary (Bl. Jose Sanchez del Rio High School Seminary) in 2008. That same year in Guyana, the IVE also started a residence for boys who aspire to the priesthood. In the province there are currently 40 priests and about 75 young men in formation.  Tajikistan  John Paul II entrusted The Mission sui iuris in Tajikistan to the care of the Institute on September 29, 1997. As the Holy See indicates, a mission sui iuris is a special missionary territory which is not part of any diocese, vicariate, or apostolic jurisdiction. Thus, to provide an organized structure to such a territory, the Pope appoints a religious superior as the highest-ranking Church authority within its boundaries. As of 2005 Tajikistan had only 245 Catholics being tended to by five priests, all of whom belong to the institute.  Missions  A priest of the Institute of the Incarnate Word makes a pastoral visit to a village in Papua New Guinea. As members of the Institute are under the auspices of the local bishops, members of the Institute may assist them in the local Churches, providing formators for the seminaries, or accepting parochial and school assignments. Thus, in addition to managing houses of formation in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Italy, Taiwan, the United States, and the Philippines, the Institute provides formators and professors for diocesan seminaries and universities in Italy, Peru, the Holy Land, Papua New Guinea, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the United States. the congregation was divided into 14 Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions of the Roman Rite and various Eastern Rites. Each jurisdiction is under the governorship of a provincial superior; the Superior General of the institute is Fr. Gustavo J. Nieto, IVE.  Religious Family of the Incarnate Word = Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matar√°  Founded on March 19, 1988 by Fr. Buela, the Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matar√° (SSVM) is the female branch of the Religious Family of the Incarnate Word. Sharing the same founder, charisma and spirituality, they are canonically independent from the Institute of the Incarnate Word. there were approximately 1,000 members in 35 mission areas. They have their own houses of formation and a contemplative branch.  Third Order  The Secular Third Order or the lay order of the Family of the Incarnate Word is an association of lay faithful who live in the world while belonging to the religious family.  Contemplative Branch  A contemplative monk of the Institute of the Incarnate Word at the Monastery of Our Lady of El Pueyo, Spain. Fr. Buela founded the contemplative branch of the Institute of the Incarnate Word in December 1988. Ever since, the monks of the Institute have dedicated themselves to prayer, living in community under the same monastery roof and subjecting themselves to a rule and an abbot. The monks live a fraternal life during times of recreation. As a sign of poverty they wear a simple monastic habit: white sackcloth, a cowl, a leather belt, and a white scapular onto which the shield of the institute is embroidered. the institute has six monasteries, one each in Argentina, Italy, Israel, and Tunisia, and two in Spain.  Way of Life  The Institute of the Incarnate Word considers its specific end to be the evangelization of the culture, to work \\"through the power of the Gospel, to transform mankind's criteria of judgment, determining values, points of interest, lines of thought, sources of inspiration, and models of life\\" (Evangelii Nuntiandi, 19). The constitutions states that its purpose is to extend the Incarnation 'to all men, in the whole man, and in all of the manifestations of man,' all in accordance with the teachings of the Magisterium of the Catholic Church. Fr. Buela wanted the institute to be named \\"of the Incarnate Word\\" to honor the \\"first and fundamental mystery of Jesus Christ,\\" in the words of Pope John Paul II. From the mystery of the Incarnation, the member is called \\"to reestablish all things in Christ,\\" (Eph 1:10).  Priestly Identity  From the institute's Constitutions and Directories, there are 14 essential traits that must characterize a priest of the IVE. Within the institute, itself, they are known as the \\"non-negotiable\\" elements of its identity as a religious congregation. The \\"non-negotiables\\" are:Priests of the Institute of the Incarnate Word celebrate Mass for seminarians on a mountaintop during a summer hiking trip in the United States. #He prolongs the Incarnation of Christ # He professes vows of chastity, poverty, obedience and Marian slavery # He intensely practices the virtues of self-denial # He celebrates the Holy Mass with dignity # He practices a serious (and not a sentimental) spirituality # He is docile to the living Magisterium of the Church of all times # He adheres to the teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas # He possesses a missionary and apostolic creativity # He lives a strong community life with authentic joy # He \\"sinks his teeth into reality\\" # He chooses the mission no one else wants # He practices works of mercy, above all with the handicapped, etc. # He has a providential outlook on life # He lives through Mary, with Mary, in Mary, and for Mary  Missionary Spirit  The Institute places a high priority on sending missionaries to places deemed to have a greater need, either because of a lack of missionaries or because the faithful are in urgent need of them. For example, since 2014, priests and religious of the Institute of the Incarnate Word and the Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matara have played important roles in caring for the displaced Christian refugees fleeing the threat of ISIS attacks in Baghdad and in Syria. The institute also has an eastern branch in accord with John Paul II's call for the Church to breathe with \\"two lungs,\\" Eastern and Western.  Patroness  Image of Our Lady of Lujan from the IVE seminary in Washington, DC. Venerated as the beloved Patroness of Argentina, Our Lady of Luj√°n is also considered the Patroness of the institute. Her image is on the walls of the rectories, convents, houses of formation, and all the other foundations common to the Religious Family. As patroness of the missionaries of the Religious Family of the Incarnate Word, Our Lady of Luj√°n continues to journey to foreign lands.  Apostolates  The Institute of the Incarnate Word annually hosts a weekend-long \\"Youth Festival\\" for high school aged youth at their retreat center in Upstate New York. Members of the Institute devote themselves specially to preaching. They study scripture, theology, and in the liturgy; they teach it to youth; and they preach it in the forms of popular missions (intensive pastoral missions) and the Spiritual Exercises (retreats conducted according to the method of St. Ignatius of Loyola). The institute is also involved in works of charity with those most in need abandoned children, the disabled, the sick, and the elderly‚Äîin various houses of charity throughout the world. Members of the Institute publish articles in journals, periodicals, essays, books, etc.  Government of the Institute  * Until 1994: Father Carlos Miguel Buela, IVE (Founder) * 1994‚Äì2000: Father Jos√© Luis Solari, IVE (General Superior) * 1995‚Äì1998: Jos√© Antonio Rico, OSB (Pontifical Delegate) * 1998/1999: Aurelio Londo√±o, CM (Pontifical Delegate) * 1999‚Äì2001: Alfonso Delgado Evers, OD, Bishop of Posadas (Pontifical Delegate) * 2001‚Äì2010: Father Carlos Miguel Buela, IVE (2001.05.27 ‚Äì 2010.01.22) * 2010‚Äì2015: Father Carlos Walker, IVE (2010.07.15 ‚Äì 2015.12.15) * 2015/16: Angelo Todisco (Roman Rota) and Philippe Tox√©, OP (Papal commissioners) * 2016: Father Gustavo Nieto, IVE (2016.07.12 ‚Äì ...)

Based on the 1934 stage musical Anything Goes by Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse, the stage version contains songs by Cole Porter. The film is about a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman whom he follows onto a luxury liner, where he discovers she is an English heiress who ran away from home and is now being returned to England. He also discovers that his boss is on the ship. To avoid discovery, he disguises himself as the gangster accomplice of a minister, who is actually a gangster on the run from the law. The film required revisions of Porter's saucy lyrics to pass Production Code censors. Only four of his songs remained: \\"Anything Goes\\", \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\", \\"There'll Always Be a Lady Fair\\", and \\"You're the Top\\". \\"You're the Top\\" contained substantially revised lyrics, and only the first line (sung by Ethel Merman during the opening credits) was retained from the song \\"Anything Goes\\". Bing Crosby's influence was used to gut most of Porter's score and obtain four new songs from several new songwriters, Richard A. Whiting, Hoagy Carmichael, Leo Robin, Edward Heyman, and Friedrich Hollander, but other than \\"Moonburn\\", written by Hoagy Carmichael and Edward Heyman, which temporarily became a hit for Crosby, it is usually agreed that most of the replacement score was forgettable. Some, including movie musical expert John Springer, have criticized Paramount for substituting new songs by other composers for the originals. (This was a common policy in Hollywood during the 1930s, when film studios owned music publishing houses and hoped that songs written especially for films would guarantee extra profits for the studio.) When Paramount sold the 1936 film to television, they retitled the movie Tops is the Limit because the 1956 film version, also from Paramount, was currently in theaters.

Reception The New York Times wrote \\"Paramount uncorked its pent-up version of Anything Goes at the Paramount Theatre yesterday and instead of an exuberant pop and a merry fizz, there was merely a gentle sigh...Bing Crosby is an acceptable substitute for the show‚Äôs William Gaxton in almost every subdivision except that in which he joins Miss Merman in ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre The Top‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt seem possible but Mr. Crosby croons it.\\" Variety wrote \\"Cole Porter‚Äôs lyrics, which were the original essence and chief asset of the original stage Anything Goes have been sacrificed for and replaced by plot motion in this Paramount film adaptation...Ethel Merman comes from the original cast and her job in the picture equals her job in the stage version, which means aces. Crosby in the Billy Gaxton juve lead makes it more important than the latter did, because of the extra territory taken in by his singing...As directed by Lewis Milestone everything moves along swiftly. On the whole, as screen entertainment and as musical adaptation, Par‚Äôs ‚ÄòGoes‚Äô will do.\\" Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a poor review, specifically criticizing Bing Crosby's slow and \\"moony methods\\" of singing in \\"a picture which should rattle quite as fast as a sub-machine gun\\". Greene found that the song \\"You're the Top\\" had been \\"murdered\\". (reprinted in: )  References  *Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

For the second series, each episode segment follows him on his nationwide UK tour alongside his band (who hate him), in which he meets Michael Jackson, goes dating, goes for a walk, meets the real Craig David, and performs in front of a live audience. In the third series, he attempts to break America again with his new single \\"Soda Pop\\", which fails to chart. Along the way, he makes a music video and gets himself a makeover from Mel B. He appeared in Bo! in the USA, in a weekly segment in which he tries to seduce Holly Valance and earn himself a bronze swimming award. As time went on, Craig's fall from fame was chronicled as he started making appearances on shopping channels and in Cha'mone Mo'Fo' Selecta he was reduced to working in a call center. Leigh Francis stated in an interview with Metro that the character was based on Billy Casper from Kes, rather than the singer Craig David. Mel B Mel B is portrayed as a drunk, scary, and dirty old woman. She has white skin, red hair, and a massive nose. She speaks in a northern accent, which is apparent when she says the word \\"fuck\\" like \\"fook\\", and wears a leopard-print top, revealing a disturbingly hairy chest. Her best known catchphrase is \\"yer bastard ya!\\", whilst often making remarks regarding lesbian sex and her minge, which she describes as smelling like crab paste. In the first series, she features in a segment in which she promotes her new book, which discusses the split of the Spice Girls and her love for her stuffed tiger. In the second series, she becomes a non-weekly character, only appearing three times during the series, appearing in segments when she goes on holiday, shows us her \\"Crib\\" and talks about Girls Aloud. In the third series, she becomes a regular character again, and appears in a segment entitled \\"The Odd Couple\\". The segment shows her living with singer and actress Patsy Kensit, whom she is always trying to seduce and with whom she eventually has a drunken one night stand in the final episode. On the music video for Avid Merrion's cover for I Got You Babe (which also starred Patsy Kensit), Mel's father was revealed to be Jim Bowen. She also appears in Bo! in the USA, however, as a non-regular character. The real Mel B appeared a few times during the series. Michael Jackson Michael Jackson is portrayed as a frequent profanitist, usually beginning his segment by shouting \\"Cha'mone mother fucker!\\", which is a reference to the word \\"shamone\\" that Jackson often used in his music, pronouncing most words with an \\"ow\\" at the end, and always wearing the trademark rhinestone glove. In series one, his segment was titled \\"The Jacksons\\", which featured Michael showing the viewer around his family home, and having an ongoing feud with The Osbournes. In series two, a segment entitled \\"Michael Jackass\\" was premi√®red, which showed Jackson doing dangerous tasks such as wakeboarding drunk, diving in an aquarium tank covered in fish, ice skating naked, diving into a pool with his arms and legs tied up, and skydiving. In the third series, Jackson's segment was entitled \\"Doin' Porridge\\", a parody of the TV series Porridge. The segment followed his nine weeks of being in jail (the real Michael Jackson was due to face trial at the time) with his comedy hero Ronnay Barkay. He also appeared in Bo! in the USA, appearing in a renewed version of \\"Michael Jackass\\". The character featured in his own special, Chamone Mo Fo Selecta, following his real-life death in 2009. David Blaine David Blaine is portrayed as a sex-obsessed street magician. Throughout the first two series, Blaine was featured in a self- titled segment, which saw himself perform tricks against unsuspecting female members of the public. However, during the trick, he is seen rubbing his hands on their breasts or other womanly features. In series two, each trick would involve one piece of the woman's underwear being removed from their body and worn by Blaine. After the trick, he tells the person that if they want their underwear back, they would have to \\"get a room\\" with him. He didn't appear in series three or in Bo! in the USA. The Osbournes Many of the Osbourne family are parodied on Bo' Selecta. They have also appeared on the show as themselves, usually while being stalked by Avid. Ozzy is shown to have very long arms, which are constantly moving in front of his body. He is shown to be always mumbling, which makes it impossible to understand what he is saying, apart from the swear bleeps during his sentence. He sometimes shouts \\"Sharon!\\" while he is speaking. Sharon is shown to speak in a high-pitched calm voice, quite opposite to what she is like in real life. She is either always sweeping the floor with a brush, or searching for food, a reference to her real life bulimia, though is obsessed with her dogs and often is portrayed as eating their bowel movements. Kelly is the most core character of The Osbournes. She is portrayed to be always swearing, using the word \\"douchebag\\" constantly, and extremely hostile and violent. Throughout series one, she regularly appeared in \\"The Week In Bits\\" segment, often meeting other celebrities or talking about her private life. In series two, she has her own segment, entitled \\"The Kelly Osbourne Show\\", in which she goes shopping, gets a haircut, slags off other celebrities, or does an advice call-in. Jack was not featured in the first series, though briefly appeared in series two during The Kelly Osbourne Show and once during Craig David's tour, though he was portrayed as a slow moronic child like adult. In series three, his face and hair is drastically increased and he gains a Yorkshire accent in his own show \\"Jack Off\\" in which he interviews several people. His catchphrase was \\"Brown Bread!\\". Avid Merrion First appearing on Whatever I Want, Avid Merrion, played by Leigh Francis, is the main protagonist of the series. He is obsessed with celebrities and stalks them, after he grew up to become the number one celebrity super fan in the world. Originating from the small town of Arachnipuss near Transylvania, Avid was born to a father who was a Dracula- impersonating stripper. Avid lives in a flat in London, with his dead mother, who he keeps in the cupboard, and Craig Phillips, winner of the first series of Big Brother UK, who he keeps chained up in the toilet. With his slurred and broken English, a ginger mullet, eccentricity, bisexuality, peculiar sexual fetishes, poor social skills and obsession with showbiz figures, he became known as one of the scariest celebrity stalkers. He wears a neck brace which he says is due to an encounter with Liza Tarbuck. He spends most of his time harassing celebrities at functions such as book signings or movie premi√®res, highlights of which are shown throughout the first two series. Due to his nature, he became noticed by the media during the third series of Big Brother, after he repeatedly attempted to break into the house to get closer to the house mates. By the third series of this show, his newly elevated status in pop culture allowed him to talk one-on-one with celebrities, rather than stalking them. His segments in the series were transformed into his own chat show. In Bo! in the USA, Avid has given up his job as a chat show host, and now owns a hotel in Los Angeles, where many celebrities come to stay. The Bear The Bear, played by Leigh Francis with a puppet body, is also one of the main protagonists of the series. During series one, the bear's segment, entitled \\"Showbiz Chat\\", featured a regular celebrity guest chatting to The Bear, in a location which is only described as \\"up a tree, on Hampstead Heath\\". In series two, the segment was upgraded, and entitled \\"Bedtime with the Bear\\". The segment featured a similar format, with the exception of the ending, in which the guest would read the Bear a bedtime story, which would feature themselves and other celebrities becoming involved in vulgar activities. The stories would always give the Bear an erection, which he would describe as his tail popping out. He has an extreme hatred of Stephen, a ginger squirrel, who he often calls \\"a nob jockey\\". In series three, \\"A Bear's Showbiz Tail\\" saw The Bear go on location to interview celebrities. When Avid fails to turn up for the last episode of series three, The Bear is given hosting duties, which resulted in his own Christmas special, \\"A Bear's Christmas Tail\\", and the entire fourth series being based around his adventures. In Bo' in the USA, he once again has his own segment in which he interviews celebrities. He also regularly features alongside Verne Troyer, who is shown to be The Bear's agent since his move to America. He later appeared in the 2018 ITV2 series Keith Lemon - Coming in America. Ozzey Ozzey is a recurring character played by Ozzy Rezat. Ozzey was Avid Merrion's landlord. He used to make T-shirts for Avid downstairs, but after Avid got a talk show Ozzey was made part of the wardrobe department. Ozzey was a refugee who escaped to England for an unknown reason. In the first episode of series three he accidentally said it out loud and was told off by Avid. He was also made gay in series three, leading to a sketch where Avid would say television has changed into a 'blank', which would immediately cut to an impersonation of Blankety Blank. All the contestants would be gay celebrities, such as Elton John, Boy George and George Michael. After Bo' Selecta! ended and The Bear got his own show, A Bear's Tail, Ozzey had moved in with Sue Dales and Dave Ian McCall. When Bo' Selecta! returned as a new form, Bo! in the USA, Ozzey was not shown. Minor characters=The Beckhams David Beckham is childlike and Victoria acts as his mother. In one scene, a journalist asks David if he might be going to Milan, David replied saying: \\"No, I go to my nan's on Sunday, you silly!\\" he speaks with a slight lisp and is always asking when it's time for his dinner. Victoria is often grouchy and makes a pig sound while speaking. They only usually appear in either \\"The Week In Bits\\" or in the intros and outros. Kat Slater Kat Slater is portrayed as having the arms of a pig, which she regularly refers to as her \\"big flappy bingo wings\\". She believes everyone in Eastenders is secretly talking about her bingo wings. She speaks with a loud gruff accent, and often talks about being married to Shane Richie. Invariably, a real life male cast member will tell Kat how much he loves her bingo wings. Christina Aguilera In Bo' Selecta, Christina Aguilera is portrayed as a slut, in a reference to her song Dirrty. She speaks in a strong Liverpool accent and wears revealing clothes. She uses the phrase \\"I'm dead dirrttyyy\\" at the end of her segment. She first appeared in the second series, where she showed her \\"Crib\\" and launched her own video game. She is also a prostitute and sex-obsessed. It's suggested she has a long sausage-like big toe on her right foot. Elton John Elton John is extremely camp and aggressive. He is always talking about \\"gayness\\" and threatens to \\"Bum you!\\", meaning having anal sex. Elton often misinterprets questions and also is seen killing his postmen with an axe and claims to hate people. He is usually seen in \\"The Week In Bits\\" segment. In Ho Ho Ho Selecta, he delivers his own Queen's speech. He also appeared in Bo! in the USA. Gareth Gates Gareth Gates first appears in series one, in a segment in which he suffers a Tourette-like syndrome. He speaks with a strong Scottish accent and spiked hair. He also appeared in a lot of \\"The Week In Bits\\" sketches throughout the second series, in which he was always trying to say something, but couldn't due to his stutter. He can, however, get frustrated enough with his stutter to sing his sentence clearly, though it rarely happens. Enrique Iglesias' Mole Throughout the first series, a sketch where singer Enrique Iglesias's mole would show short segments of what the celebrity characters had been doing during the week was broadcast. The mole spoke with a Geordie accent and at the end would give advice to anyone with a mole how they could torture other people who make remarks about their \\"mole\\". This sketch was called \\"The Week In Whole By Enrique's Mole\\". This was replaced by \\"Jordan/Jodie Marsh's Tits\\". Jordan/Jodie Marsh's Tits In the second, there was a sketch similar to \\"The Week In Whole...\\", but this time using Jordan's nipples. The nipple would always talk critically about a celebrity and would say at the end, \\"That was the week in bits...You slags!\\". The other nipple would also add an odd sexual sound at the end of the sketch. Halfway through the second series, Jordan's Tits was replaced by Jodie Marsh's Tits, with a different visual intro and voice from the Jordan one, but essentially the same sketch. Sacha Merrion Sacha Merrion, played by Barunka O'Shaughnessy, is the wife and sister of Avid Merrion; she first appeared as a guest star on A Bear's Tail as a co-host of Avid's talk show. For Bo! in the USA, Sacha and Avid run a hotel which is currently home to various celebrities such as Craig David and even the Bear. In the third episode of Bo! in the USA, it is revealed that Avid did not seem to be as romantic as before and she seems to take a liking to the Mexican half-wolf half-man head cleaner Ralph. In episode four, she went behind Avid's back with Ralph, but was caught. She later apologised to Avid, however, he then admitted he had been stalking a female celebrity, so both decided to forgive each other and have a baby. Marilyn Manson Speaking in a rough though quite British, upper class voice, he appears to be a friendly, very well mannered man. He appears in series 2 and 3, though is mostly in filler segments in 2. He's said to have adopted a West Indian Manatee, which is doing a tour of Sea World. He's rude, but not as vulgar as other characters. His catchphrase is \\"Wicked, what?\\" in which he elongates the W of 'Wicked'. Trisha Goddard Speaking in a heavy Jamaican accent, Trisha is present in series 2 and 3, though only in ads for her products in 3. In 2, she hosts \\"The Trisha Show\\", which is a travelling version of her actual (though now ended) talk show. She's often seen with a dog and is obsessed with Rice and Peas, believing when eaten or when shouted, it makes you feel better. When she's being aggressive, she calls people 'Bumblesquat', though says 'kiss me teeth' when happy with herself and 'Irie' as a compliment. Though she says these and 'bogle bogle' quite a few times, \\"Rice and Peas\\" is her catchphrase. Davina McCall A hyperactive and very over-excited host of Big Brother UK, seen in series 2 and 3. Always pregnant and often crazied with the thought of having someone, anyone, make her pregnant (it's suggested she may have even forced her husband into sex by handcuffing him to the bed). She insists that everyone, interview or not, do not say Fuck or Bugger (this being her catchphrase) though she more than often calls people a fucking bugger. Ironically, she refers to sex as 'Nookie' and often makes bets (of about 25 to 35 pence) with people on who'll win Big Brother or if someone will have Nookie. She ends many of her sentences with \\"for myself/himself/herself\\" (e.g. \\"I'm Davina McCall for myself.\\") Jonathan Ross Found in series 2 and 3, he's often interviewing people or giving reviews. He's always calm and often makes no logical sense in conversation, most normal words replaced with 'wibble', 'wobble', 'wibbly' or other W based sounds (based on his actual speech impediment). He often asks if there's any vaginal or breast sightings in movies and rates them (U, PG, 18 etc.) accordingly. When reviewing a film, he gives his own rating (similar to stars or thumbs up) in the form of eggs, often giving a half afterwards and smashing an egg on the table, throwing half into the egg cup. He does not do this in series 3. Ricky Gervais Appearing in series 2, Ricky is portrayed as having a rough Cockney accent and always wearing a pair of boxing gloves. He keeps a gold star chart up in his 'office', which he puts stickers up on whenever he is recognised by members of the public. It is revealed it is often him getting in the way of people, as he pretends to act as if somebody completely uninterested in him has recognised him, in which he proceeds to dance like the character he plays in The Office David Brent. His catchphrases are \\"I'm Ricky Gervais, obviously.\\" and \\" You recognize me, don't ya? \\" Richard and Judy While Judy is silent constantly, often trembling and performing nervous traits (like chewing her nails) with her breast slipping out of her shirt on occasion, Richard is seen as controlling, telling the silent Judy not to speak and blaming her for talking should anything go wrong. He is also seen raising a hand to strike her, suggesting he has frightened her into a silent and submissive state. They are never seen apart. Trinny and Susannah The pair are portrayed as a lesbian couple, and it is strongly suggested that Trinny is transgender. They both have an obsession with other women's breasts, calling them \\"Baps\\". This often leads to \\"Pudding Time\\", in which the pair begin to kiss and is suggested they have intercourse. They are never seen apart either. Lorraine Kelly Speaking in a deep Scottish accent, almost man like in tone, she's often seen on her chair in the GMTV studio. Regardless of her guests sexuality, she often spreads her (ridiculously tiny) legs to reveal her 'growler' (vagina). This became her catchphrase (\\"Can you see ma growler?\\"). Nadia Almada The transgender winner of Big Brother UK 2004, Nadia is portrayed as a high pitched Mexican woman who still keeps her male genitals, often slipping down into a deep male voice on occasion. Davina McCall never knows what to call Nadia, so often refers to her as \\"Herself, Himself, ITself\\". She appears to have some form of split personality, her deep voice appearing on certain occasions, such as panic or even anger when she slaps another housemate in the face. Her testicles are often seen (and heard) bouncing around to add to comical humour. Martine McCutcheon A singer famous for the song 'Perfect Moment'. Often singing it before throwing up violently. After saying something she's done, she asks what's other people's perfect moment, before throwing up again. Once they've explained, she's seen throwing up before saying \\"Perfect!\\". George Michael Seen as extremely camp and a sexual deviant, he's often heard saying \\"Don't you worry about it!\\" (his catchphrase). He's best described as a gay stereotype, complete with camp voice and behaviour. He often refers to the time he pleasured two men in a public toilet, saying he 'skied really violently with them' (based on the real-life situation when he was caught doing the same act). Simon Cowell Portrayed as having hairy arms, jiggly manboobs and an unusually big chin, he says to have invented things such as the Grammys and even real people like Michael Jackson, Uri Geller and Leona Lewis. His catchphrase is repeating the word 'potentially'. Ant and Dec Ant and Dec are the presenters of the TV show 'Ant Man & Dec Pet's Take Out', a parody of their real life programme Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. Ant is portrayed as having a high forehead and pants like a dog (he explains to Dec in one sketch this is because of all the blood rushing down from his forehead), whilst Dec constantly quotes his father and can be seen twitching. The sketches all revolve around Ant being sodomised by a celebrity guest using strange items (such as a satellite dish and a snooker cue), whilst Dec goes backstage to 'have a stotty cake'. In the last ever sketch, Ant is sodomised by Dec himself, but as Dec says \\"I won't be using an implement, I'll be using me manhood\\". Other Other minor celebrity characters in Bo' Selecta include Britney Spears, Geri Halliwell, Jade Goody, Destiny's Child, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Pete Doherty, Michael Douglas and many more.

During the American Civil War, an incident at the creek resulted in the drowning of many freed slaves. Background Throughout Sherman's March to the Sea, thousands of people escaping slavery attached themselves to the Union army's various infantry columns. Most eventually turned back, but those that remained were looked on as \\"a growing encumbrance\\" as the army approached Savannah in December 1864.Foote, p. 649 Complicating the situation, Confederate cavalry under General Joseph Wheeler were actively harassing the Federal rear guard during this period.Miles, p. 128 Abandonment at Ebenezer Creek On December 8, 1864, the Union XIV Corps, under Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis, reached the western bank of Ebenezer Creek. While Davis' engineers began assembling a pontoon bridge for the crossing, Wheeler's cavalry approached close enough to conduct sporadic shelling of the Union lines.Miles, p. 136 By midnight the bridge was ready, and Davis's 14,000 men began their crossing. Over 600 freed people were anxious to cross with them, but Davis ordered his provost marshal to prevent this. The freedmen were told that they would be able to cross after a Confederate force in front had been dispersed. In reality, no such force existed. As the last Union soldiers reached the eastern bank on the morning of December 9, Davis's engineers abruptly cut the bridge loose and drew it up onto the shore.Miles, p. 138 On realizing their plight, a panic set in amongst the freedmen, who knew that Confederate cavalry were nearby. They \\"hesitated briefly, impacted by a surge of pressure from the rear, then stampeded with a rush into the icy water, old and young alike, men and women and children, swimmers and non-swimmers, determined not to be left behind.\\"Foote, p. 649 In the uncontrolled, terrified crush, many quickly drowned. On the eastern bank, some of Davis's soldiers made an effort to help those that they could reach, wading into the water as far as they dared.Foote, p. 650 Others felled trees into the water. Several of the freedmen lashed logs together into a crude raft, which they used to rescue those they could and then to ferry others across the stream. Miles, p. 139 While these efforts were under way, scouts from Wheeler's cavalry arrived, fired briefly at the soldiers on the far bank, and left to summon Wheeler's full force. Officers from the XIV Corps ordered their men to leave the scene, and the march was resumed. The freedmen continued their frantic efforts to ferry as many as possible across the stream on the makeshift raft, but when Wheeler's cavalry arrived in force, those refugees who had not made it to the eastern bank, or drowned in the attempt, were enslaved once more.Miles, p. 140 Aftermath Historical marker, erected by the Georgia Historical Society in 2010. Davis's orders infuriated several of the Union men who witnessed the ensuing calamity, among them Major James A. Connolly and Chaplain John J. Hight.Miles, p. 139 Connolly described the events in a letter to the Senate Military Commission, which found its way into the press. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton brought the incident up with Sherman and Davis during a visit to Savannah in January 1865. Davis defended his actions as a matter of military necessity, with Sherman's full support. Sherman, ch. XXII In 2010, the Georgia Historical Society erected a historical marker titled \\"March to the Sea: Ebenezer Creek\\" near the site, recognizing the 1864 tragedy and its outcome.

Mandler was born into a German farmer's family. In 1947 he joined Ernst Leitz at Wetzlar as a lens designer, working with . At the same time he studied in Giessen University. Later he obtained a bachelor's degree in Physics and then a Ph.D. (summa cum laude) in 1979. In 1952 Ernst Leitz decided to establish Ernst Leitz Canada (ELCAN) at Midland, Ontario. Walter Mandler was one of the team members \\"on loan\\" for a short period of time. However, Mandler stayed in Canada for more than half a century and became a Canadian citizen. Walter Mandler's chief contribution to the optical engineering was his pioneering works in application of computer aided design in optical engineering. Midland optical department was specialized in the research of retrofocus designs and apochromatic corrections. Mandler employed sophisticated combinations of special glasses in his apochromatic and high-speed designs, and many of these glasses were original Leitz formulas manufactured by Schott or Corning. Mandler was a master in optimizing Double-Gauss designs by means of the computer, and a particular method developed by him and explained in his doctoral dissertation. Walter Mandler became vice president of ELCAN from 1974, being an optical advisor for Leica until his retirement in 1985. Walter Mandler died on 21 April 2005 in Midland, Ontario.  Mandler lenses  Walter Mandler is credited with the design of more than 45 high performance Leica lenses for the Leica rangefinder cameras and Leica SLR cameras, including many landmark designs: Ernst Leitz Canada Elmarit-R 19 mm/2.8 Leica Summicron 50 mm/2 Leica Macro-Elmarit-R 60 mm/2.8 Leica Summicron-R 90 mm/2 Leica Elmarit-R 90 mm/2.8 Apo-Telyt-R 180 mm/3.4 Leica Telyt 400 mm A complete list of Leica M and R lenses designed by Walter Mandler as selected by Mandler himself not in chronological order (Viewfinder, Volume 38, Number 2, 2005, page 12): Screw- mount lenses *1) Summicron 35 mm/2 *2) Summicron 90 mm/2 *3) Elmar 135 mm/4 *4) Telyt 200 mm/4 *5) Telyt 280 mm/4.8 *6) Telyt 400 mm/5 (2nd) Leica M lenses *7) Elmarit 21 mm/2.8 (first retrofocus 21 mm design, in catalogue from 1980 to 1997.

Mandler also designed lenses for IMAX movie projection systems, high-aperture lenses for Picker X-ray applications, lenses for RCA Victor television cameras, extrahigh resolution lenses for intelligence- gathering, scopes for the Canadian, US and NATO armed forces, lenses for HP scanners, etc.  Mandler's significance  After his death, Ichiro Yoshiyama, former Chief Operating Officer of Minolta Corporation, declared \\"Dr. Walter Mandler was [...] always the subject of adoration among engineers of Minolta's optical engineering sections\\".Viewfinder Magazine, Vol. 38, No. 2 Hiroshi Kimata, former editor of Popular Photography magazine, declared \\"Above all advanced cameras, the most respected and admired cameras and lenses in Japan are still the Leica cameras and Leica lenses. Without Leicas, no Japanese camera industry might be inspired to develop single-lens-reflex cameras and automatic machines. Leicas are still the unconquered highest summit of the world of photography\\". Interviewed by Tom Abrahamsson in the early 80s about his favourite designs Mandler answered \\"Right now it is the 75 mm/1.4 Summilux because it's balance between performance and size\\". However, the current head of the optical department at Leica, Peter Karbe, interviewed during the photokina 2008 show, doesn't like this lens, which was discontinued in 2007. Mandler designed the Summilux-M 75 mm f/1.4 lens (1980) based on his previous design for the Summilux-M 50 mm f/1.4 lens (1961), but using new glass first applied to the Noctilux-M 50 mm f/1.0 lens (1969). In the same way, Karbe designed the APO-Summicron-M 75 mm f/2.0 ASPH lens (2005) based on his Summilux-M 50 mm f/1.4 ASPH lens (2004). Peter Karbe wrote some lines about Mandler after his death: \\"I can readily say that Dr. Mandler was one of the great optical designers at Leitz and that his work constituted a major contribution to the success of the Leica M rangefinder camera. Dr. Mandler was clearly ahead of his times with his developments. That is proven by the numerous optical computations that still have lost nothing in terms of current relevance. Among them is the 50 mm f/1 Noctilux-M lens that he designed. Today, many publications still refer to his work, notably the landmark 50 mm f/2 Summicron-M lens. And there are numerous other examples that prove how important his work was for the evolution of photographic optics in general and for the evolution of photography at Leitz. This includes his apochromatically corrected telephoto lenses. [...] While I was writing these lines, it occurred to me that that I am not qualified to render a judgment of Dr. Mandler.\\" Erwin Puts wrote in an essay about Zeiss lenses that \\"The great revolution in optical designs occurred during the sixties and seventies, when Dr. Glatzel (Erhard Glatzel) of Zeiss introduced new methods of lens design. In the Leica- centric view of the world, one often assumes that well-known Leica designers, like Dr. Mandler, are in the front rank of the world's best optical designers. In fact this is not the case. Persons like Dr. Glatzel or Dr. Kingslake (Rudolf Kingslake) have had a more lasting impact on the evolution of lens design. It is only quite recently that Leica lens designs have broken out of the traditional constraints that have restrained the free flow of creativity of the design department.\\"http://www.imx.nl/photo/zeiss/zeiss/page65.html Also in Puts' essay on Leica optical designers some clues about Mandler's significance can be found: \\"The key word for the Mandler designs is \\"state-of- the-art\\". The designs are first rate, even today, but the Japanese competition came quite close to producing the same level of imagery. The Leitz designs had their own typical set of compromises that distinguished their lenses from the rest, but the best of Zeiss, Canon and Nikon and Topcon were measurably on the same level [...] The Mandler era delivered first rate lenses, but they were mainstream lenses that fitted into the Zeitgeist of the 35 mm style of photography. The innovations (zoomlenses) however were snatched away from Leitz by the Japanese companies.\\"http://www.imx.nl/photo/optics/styled-19/ Erwin Puts concludes: \\"He was also a daring man: he created the Summilux 1.4/35 mm when everybody assumed that such a lens was not possible. Mandler was a pragmatist more than a visionary. His designs are very competent, but he had to work within the restrictions of the Leitz philosophy of lens manufacture. It seems that lenses for 35 mm photography were a bit boring for him, as they did not pose the challenge he wanted. This he found in the designs for the military and in the ELCAN lenses he could explore more exciting optical limits. [...] There are only a few letters by Mandler in the Leica archives and the contents give the impression of a passionate man, who feels slightly frustrated by the slow progress made by Leitz and the fast improvements made by the Japanese. He clearly saw that without fundamental changes Leica could not compete in the long run. But Leitz was in those days already living on borrowed money. His ELCAN designs were by nature less cost oriented and the knowledge gained here could be transferred to the photographic department. [...] Mandler's study about the Double-Gauss designs is still the definitive analysis of the limits and potential of this class of lenses. The book was published in 1979 and represented the state of the art in optical design at that time. His achievement was the transfer of that theoretical framework to practical design. He did not develop really innovative designs, but his strong point was the exploration of existing limits and to find ways to implement the almost impossible.\\" Reginald P. Jonas and Michael D. Thorpe, in the article quoted, also present a valuation of Mandler's significance. Mandler was Head of Optical and Mechanical design at Leitz Canada for 20 years \\"during which time he was involved in the design of over 400 lenses, including many photographic objectives, as well as lenses for movie taking, movie projection, laser scanning, and other speciality optics. In those days optical design was very much a group effort. Walter Mandler's contribution as physicist and designer was to set out the general direction in which design solutions would proceed and to bring his experience and knowledge of optical design theory to select the shortest path to a solution. The solution chosen was not always the most excellent in the imaging sense but it would be the best solution, balancing performance, cost, and manufacturability. As a result many of these designs remained in production for decades\\". To sum up, \\"His name will always be synonymous with the best in photographic Double-Gauss lenses\\".

The Cathedral of the Saviour (Spanish: Catedral de Cristo Salvador) is a Catholic church in √Åvila in the south of Old Castile, Spain. It was built in the late Romanesque and Gothic architectural traditions. It was planned as a cathedral-fortress, its apse being one of the turrets of the city walls. It is surrounded by a number of houses or palaces, the most important being: the Palace of the Evening, the Palace of the Infant King, and the Palace of Valderr√°banos, which were responsible for the defence of the Puerta de los Leales (The Gate of the Loyal Ones) also known as La Puerta del Peso de la Harina (The Flour Road Gate).  History  It is not known exactly when the construction of the cathedral began. Two theories exist. One states that Alvar Garc√≠a started its construction in 1091 inside the remains of a previous Romanesque Church of the Saviour, which was left in ruins as a result of successive Muslim attacks, and that Alfonso VII of Castile raised the money necessary to build it. Other historians believe the Cathedral to be the work of the maestro Fruchel in the 12th century coinciding with the repopulation of Castille led by Raymond of Burgundy.  Characteristics  Apse of the Cathedral of √Åvila The Cathedral of √Åvila is considered by its age (12th century), along with the Cathedral of Cuenca, as the first two Gothic cathedrals in Spain. It predates other important Spanish Gothic cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of Burgos (1222‚Äì1260) and the Cathedral of Le√≥n (started about 1255).Lapunzina, Alejandro. Architecture of Spain. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. The cathedral shows French influences and great resemblances to the Abbey Church of St Denis, the first European Gothic church. The construction was started by Girald Fruchel in the 12th century. This construction was continued and modified until the 17th century, going from Gothic architecture to Classicism (Saint Secundus chapel) and finally Baroque architecture (Velada Chapel). The first stages of the towers and the aisles date from the 13th century, alongside the second stage of the towers (one remaining unfinished), the cloister, the vaults and the flying buttresses date from the following century. Already in the fifteenth century all the works on the cathedral were complete and, in 1475, Juan Guas built the mechanical clock, in addition to moving the western portal to the north side. Interior The cathedral consists of a central nave and two aisles with a wide transept. They are of equal width but the central one is notably higher and it opens with large windows to the outside. They are separated by fine columns and pointed arches, which give this space a feeling of lightness and clarity. The vaults are mostly of simple quadripartite ribbing. The alabaster baptismal font (1514‚Äì1516) is the work of Vasco de la Zarza. The thick wall of the ambulatory of the apse is embedded in the solid, fortified wall surrounding the city. A retrochoir divides the central nave from the transept, the choir and the apse. The plateresque retrochoir was intricately decorated with high-reliefs by Lucas Giraldo and . They show in great detail and with naturalism five scenes from the childhood of Jesus. In the Epiphany, Balthasar is highlighted in black. The walnut choir stalls (with a misericord), behind the retrochoir, are aligned with the side of the church. They date from the first half of the 16th century. The work was carried out by the Flemish schulptor Cornielles de Holanda with the participation of Lucas Giraldo, Juan Rodr√≠guez and Isidro Villoldo. The transept contains the alabaster altars of Saint Secundus (patron saint of √Åvila ) and Saint Catherine, both made by Vasco de la Zarza in the first half of the 16th century. The altar of Saint Secundus was completed by Isidro Villoldo, while the altar of Saint Catherine was completed by Lucas Giraldo and Juan Rodr√≠guez. The enormous altarpiece of the main altar was begun by Pedro Berruguete in the transition from the 15th to the 16th century. He carried out eight predellas portraying in detail and naturalism images of Evangelists and Doctors of the Church, as well as two boards portraying the \\"Prayer in the Garden\\" and the \\"Flagellation\\". These paintings, perhaps reflecting the prevailing style in Castile at the time, use gold backgrounds and somewhat rigid compositions. After his death, his assistant, Santos Cruz, continued the work with \\"the Crucifixion\\", \\"the Resurrection\\" and the \\"Epiphany\\". The rest of the scenes were carried out by Juan de Borgo√±a. The ambulatory is surrounded with a triforium. It contains nine side chapels and five large, richly decorated panels with reliefs (attributed to Lucas Giraldo and Vasco dela Zarza). The middle panel is an alabaster piece, with a wealth of detail and structured like a retable, by Vasco de la Zarza and accommodates the tomb of Alonso de Madrigal, also named \\"El Tostado\\", a bishop of √Åvila. The cathedral museum, located in the sacristies, houses a large number of works of art, among which the portrait of the knight Don Garci B√°√±ez de Muxica by El Greco and the chalice and paten of Saint Secundus. But it most notable work is the enormous processional monstrance (1571), a shrine in six bodies by the goldsmith Juan de Arphe y Villafa√±e. Its main theme is the \\"Sacrifice of Isaac\\".

Early days Miller was born as Michael Lawton on 25 February 1950 in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. Miller's first ambition was to be a footballer. He played as a goalkeeper, and as a boy he signed for Port Vale when Sir Stanley Matthews was the club's general manager and had a trial for the England youth team. When he left football, he began performing at Pontins, where he became interested in stand-up comedy. Having cut his teeth as chief comedian at various Pontins venues, he moved to the North of England and embarked upon a career in the clubs. Stand-up career Having won his heat on the talent show New Faces, Miller was immediately signed to support Chuck Berry on tour. Since then, he has been a regular at Blackpool, working men's clubs, cruises and after dinner speeches. His shows have been released on DVD, and he has made many TV appearances. Television appearances Miller was a regular on the 1970s stand-up show The Comedians, co-presented The Funny Side, regularly appeared on Today With Des and Mel and has been a guest on Blankety Blank, They think it's all over and Des O'Connor Tonight. He acted in Alan Bleasdale's 1978 Play for Today Scully's New Year. In it he played the part of a wannabe stand up comedian. In 1993, Miller guested for Chester City in the Granada football Go for Goal quiz show, alongside Arthur Albiston and Joe Hinnigan. Chester City reached the final before losing to Preston North End. In 2005, he took part in the reality TV show Kings Of Comedy alongside Stan Boardman, Janey Godley, Andrew Maxwell, Boothby Graffoe and David Copperfield. In 2008 and 2009, he made several appearances on the BBC3 sitcom Ideal, as the father of Johnny Vegas's Moz.

History Windsor High School was named after a sunken Civil War gunboat that was docked in the Mississippi River in Kimmswick, Missouri. This boat was never recorded in military or naval records and could have been used as a decoy to ward off Confederate raiding parties. This ship was sunk in the late 19th century during an ice storm. The ice crushed the boat from both sides letting out a thunderous crack that woke a man living in Kimmswick who recorded the event in the local newspaper much later in his life. The boat only had the name the locals gave it, \\"Windsor\\". According to the early history of Windsor, the school publication was named the Captain's Log, referring to the old gunboat; however, this name has since been changed to \\"The Vision\\". It was later renamed The Hoot in late 2016 as the newspaper transitioned to an online format.https://whsthehoot.com/595/news/a-new-vision-for-the-vision/ Academics Windsor offers a wide variety of courses, including honors, dual credit, and Advanced Placement classes.

The son of a vineyard owner from Lausanne (he was born in nearby Prilly) he attended the Military Academy of Modena and pursued a successful career in the Swiss Army, achieving the highest peacetime rank of brigadier general whilst commanding the 4th Infantry Brigade.A Survey of Nazi and Pro-Nazi Groups in Switzerland: 1930-1945 by Alan Morris Schom for the Simon Wiesenthal Center Fonjallaz took an early interest in politics, although his ideas were ill-defined as he was both a radical and an admirer of Enrico Corradini, whilst also becoming involved in an agrarian progenitor of the Swiss People's Party.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 129 Leaving the party in 1932, he took up a post as principal of military sciences and war history at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©deral in Z√ºrichRees, op cit Colonel Fonjallaz was, however, relieved of his duties in 1933 after it came to light that he had been a member of the governing board of the fascistic Heimatwehr as well as the National Front, both of which were noted for their virulent anti-Semitism.Schom, op cit The wealthy Fonjallaz then set up Helvetic Action Against Secret Societies which was particularly geared towards opposing Freemasonry. Taking advantage of the initiative process, Fonjallaz attempted to pass an amendment to the Swiss Federal Constitution banning the practice, but this was defeated in 1937. In 1932, he had also led a group of his supporters to Italy for a meeting with Benito Mussolini and became a strong supporter of Italian fascism as a result. He soon founded the Swiss Fascist Federation, which received 2 million lira a year from Mussolini. A devoted follower of Mussolini, he spoke of the power of the rhetoric of Il Duce in glowing terms. > As Mussolini began to speak presenting the goals of fascism, we Swiss > understood immediately the significance of this man and responded to the > radiant power of his personality. We were all directly convinced that such a > leader could do more for world peace than hundreds of politicians. A supporter of a possible Italian annexation of the country, Fonjallaz was expelled from the Heimatwehr for this position, but continued to be a devotee of Mussolini, publishing a biography of his hero, En√©rgie et Volont√© (Drive and Will), in 1937. Despite this, Italian funding ended in 1936 and Fonjallaz disappeared from public life. Colonel Fonjallaz returned to the public eye in January 1940 when border guards arrested him in Schaffhausen as he was attempting to enter Nazi Germany. In a subsequent trial, Fonjallaz was found guilty of being a spy for Adolf Hitler, spending over two years in prison as a result. Released in 1943, he died the following year.

He submitted it to The Dial for publication, but they declined to print it. It was not published until after Thoreau's death. The essay uses war and military discipline as metaphors that, as Thoreau would have it, can instruct us in how to order and conduct our lives.  Themes  The Service is in part a contrarian swipe at the many pacifist writers and lecturers whose teachings on \\"nonresistance\\" were then very much in vogue, in part thanks to Christian anarchist and pacifist Adin Ballou who spoke on the subject at the Concord Lyceum on occasion and who founded the New England Non-Resistance Society (of which William Lloyd Garrison was also a leader, and a Lyceum speaker as well). Thoreau debated the subject \\"Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?\\" in a formal Lyceum debate (arguing the affirmative) in 1841, and surviving records of the Lyceum note that the subject came up many times in debates, discussions, and lectures. Thoreau's own views were very much influenced by these non-resistants, and are often confused with them even today. When Amos Bronson Alcott resisted his taxes to protest war and slavery, three years before Thoreau would resist his taxes over the same issues, Alcott's action was explained within the context of \\"non-resistant\\" philosophy. When Thoreau explained his own tax resistance, he took pains to distinguish his theory from theirs, titling his essay Resistance to Civil Government. In The Service, Thoreau tosses barbs at the non-resistance preachers, warning his readers that pacifism can be a temptation to passivity:  Note  On-line text  * * The Service at sniggle.net.

Some species within it were formerly classed as Alteromonas. Shewanella consists of facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods, most of which are found in extreme aquatic habitats where the temperature is very low and the pressure is very high. Shewanella bacteria are a normal component of the surface flora of fish and are implicated in fish spoilage.Adams and Moss, Food Microbiology, third edition 2008, pp 26, 138, 140, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a widely used laboratory model to study anaerobic respiration of metals and other anaerobic extracellular electron acceptors, and for teaching about microbial electrogenesis and microbial fuel cells. Metabolism Currently known Shewanella species are heterotrophic facultative anaerobes.Serres, Genomic Analysis of Carbon Source Metabolism of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1: Predictions versus Experiments, Journal of Bacteriology, July 2006 In the absence of oxygen, members of this genus possess capabilities allowing the use of a variety of other electron acceptors for respiration. These include thiosulfate, sulfite, or elemental sulfur,Burns, Anaerobic Respiration of Elemental Sulfur and Thiosulfate by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 Requires psrA, a Homolog of the phsA Gene of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 19 June 2009 as well as fumarate.Pinchuk et al., Pyruvate and lactate metabolism by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under fermentation, oxygen limitation, and fumarate respiration conditions., Applied and Environmental Microbiology December 2011 Marine species have demonstrated an ability to use arsenic as an electron acceptor as well.Saltikov et al., Expression Dynamics of Arsenic Respiration and Detoxification in Shewanella sp. Strain ANA-3, Journal of Bacteriology, Nov 2005 Some members of this species, most notably Shewanella oneidensis, have the ability to respire through a wide range of metal species, including manganese, chromium, uranium, and iron.Tiedje, Shewanella‚Äîthe environmentally versatile genome, Nature Biotechnology Reduction of iron and manganese through Shewanella respiration has been shown to involve extracellular electron transfer through the employment of bacterial nanowires, extensions of the outer membrane.Pirbadian et al., Bacterial Nanowires of Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1 are Outer Membrane and Periplasmic Extensions of the Extracellular Electron Transport Components, Biophysical Journal, Volume 108, Jan 2015 Applications The discovery of some of the respiratory capabilities possessed by members of this genus has opened the door to possible applications for these bacteria. The metal-reducing capabilities can potentially be applied to bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater,Newsome, The biogeochemistry and bioremediation of uranium and other priority radionuclides, Chemical Geology, Volume 363, pp 164-184, 10 Jan 2014, with the reduced form of uranium produced being easier to remove from water than the more soluble uranium oxide. Scientists researching the creation of microbial fuel cells, designs that use bacteria to induce a current, have also made use of the metal reducing capabilities some species of Shewanella possess as a part of their metabolic repertoire.Hoffman et al., Dual-chambered bio-batteries using immobilized mediator electrodes, Journal of Applied Electrochemistry, Vol 43, Issue 7, pp 629‚Äì636, 27 Apr 2013  Significance  One of the roles that the genus Shewanella has in the environment is bioremediation. Shewanella species have great metabolic versatility; they can reduce various electron acceptors. Some of the electron acceptors they use are toxic substances and heavy metals, which often become less toxic after being reduced. Examples of metals that Shewanella are capable of reducing and degrading include uranium, chromium, and iron. Its ability to decrease toxicity of various substances makes Shewanella a useful tool for bioremediation. Specifically, Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 is often used to clean up contaminated nuclear weapon manufacturing sites. Shewanella also contributes to the biogeochemical circulation of minerals. Members of this genus are widely distributed in aquatic habitats, from the deep sea to the shallow Antarctic Ocean. Its diverse habitats, coupled to its ability to reduce a variety of metals, makes the genus critical for the cycling of minerals. For instance, under aerobic conditions, various species of Shewanellaare capable of oxidizing manganese. When conditions are changed, the same species can reduce the manganese oxide products. Hence, since Shewanella can both oxidize and reduce manganese, it is critical to the cycling of manganese.

She annotated the Russian Edition of \\"The Betrothed\\" by Alessandro Manzoni. She has also translated a number of modern Italian poets: Amelia Rosselli, Vittorio Magrelli, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Roberto Roversi, Rocco Scotellaro, Salvatore Quasimodo, Vittorio Sereni, etc. Her translations were included in the \\"Verses of the Century\\" anthology (Moscow, 1998). In 1988 her translation of Umberto Eco‚Äôs The Name of the Rose made her famous overnight. Ever since its first publication the book has never been out of print (more than ten subsequent editions of the translation since it was first published). Later she translated other Umberto Eco‚Äôs novels (Foucault's Pendulum, The Island of the Day Before, Baudolino, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, and others). Between 1989 and 2008 she taught Russian Literature and Art of the Literary Translation first at Trento University, later at the University of Trieste and at the University of Milan. Under her editorship various Anthologies were published: \\"Modern Russian Narrators selected by Elena Kostioukovitch\\" (Milan, Bompiani 1988), \\"The Roots of Russian Culture\\" by Dmitry Likhachov (Milan, Fratelli Fabbri Editori, 1991), \\"Jewish Stories and Tales\\" from a manuscript that was rescued from the KGB‚Äôs archives (Milan, Bompiani, 2002), and \\"The Price of a Human Being\\" by Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya (Milan, Bompiani, 2009). She also authored numerous entries dedicated to Russian writers in the \\"Bompiani Dictionary of Works and Personalities\\" (Milan, Fratelli Fabbri Editori, 2004). She also edited \\"Five centuries of European drawings\\" (Leonardo Arte, Milan, 1995), \\"Treasures of Troya\\" (Leonardo Arte, Milan, 1996), and \\"The S.Petersburg Muraqqa\\", (Leonardo Arte, Milan, 1996).

It has been isolated from marine environments, as well as from anaerobic sandstone in the Morrison Formation in New Mexico. S. putrefaciens is also a facultative anaerobe with the ability to reduce iron and manganese metabolically; that is, it can use iron and manganese as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain (in contrast to obligate aerobes which must use oxygen for this purpose). It is also one of the organisms associated with the odor of rotting fish, as it is a marine organism which produces trimethylamine (hence the species name putrefaciens, from putrid). In both solid and liquid media, S. putrefaciens is often recognizable by its bright pink color. On solid media, the colonies are round, fast-growing, and pink. The organism is also fast-growing in liquid media, and there will give the liquid an overall pink hue. On blood agar plates, the colonies are typically convex and large, with a brown pigment, and cause ‚Äúgreening‚Äù of the agar around the colonies. S. putrefaciens are non-lactose fermenters on MacConkey agar. As with all Shewanella, this organism produces hydrogen sulfide on TSI.Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 10th Edition. Although it is very rare for it to act as a human pathogen, there have been cases of infections and bacteremia caused by S. putrefaciens. S. putrefaciens is one of several species that have been shown to derive energy by reducing U(VI) to U(IV), which is thought to be important in making Uranium deposits. In fact, strain CN32 is very metabolically versatile and is capable of reducing metals, metalloids, and even radionuclides in place of oxygen during anaerobic growth.

Rogozin has also stated that the party will contest seats in the December elections to the State Duma. Rogozin estimated that the party would obtain twenty five percent of the vote in the election, and opinion polls suggested the party had a good chance of crossing the seven percent threshold for representation in the Duma.Great Russia Refused Registration, The Moscow Times (July 25, 2007) On 24 July 2007 Great Russia was denied registration by the Federal Registration Service. The Secretary of the party's ruling council, Sergei Pykhtin, said the party would either appeal the decision or submit new paperwork in an attempt to be registered. However, the party was unsuccessful and so did not contest the 2007 Russian legislative election.

It is their third release on Earache Records and the first to feature Peter Benjamin on bass, having replaced Peter Theobalds. The limited edition super jewel case version (Limited to 8000 copies worldwide) includes two bonus tracks, these are covers of songs by Morbid Angel & Death. A video has been released for the song \\"Axiom\\". The lyrics \\"I believe that when I die, I shall rot, and nothing of my ego shall survive\\" from \\"Axiom\\" are taken from the writings of Bertrand Russell.  Recording  The preparations for the recording of Antichrist began in late November 2006. The band started recording at its own Goat of Mendes Studios in December. However, in mid- January 2007, bassist Peter Theobalds has announced his departure from Akercocke. Theobalds explained that \\"reasons are many and varied but the principal factor has been that the original vibe that drove [him] to play has gone. The fun, the utter immersion of the music and friendship and the camaraderie has been slowly eroding for [him], personally, over the last year or so.\\" The band quickly announced bassist Peter Benjamin as a replacement, and resumed the recordings of Antichrist throughout February.  Musical style and lyrical themes  Controversy  Before its release, the album caused uproar amongst Northern Ireland's religious community, and was subject of a major religious debate on BBC Northern Ireland. The debate was presented by Stephen Nolan at his Nolan Live television programme, broadcast live via satellite link at 10:45 p.m. on BBC One Northern Ireland following Akercocke's gig on 16 May at the Rock City club in Nottingham. According to Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles magazine, the controversy started after Akercocke made available the song \\"Summon the Antichrist\\" on 26 April in a MySpace page dedicated for fans find out more information about the album, as well as to participate in \\"The Antichrist Code\\" contest. A producer from BBC Northern Ireland called Mendonca and asked if he would be interested in taking part in a debate. She said some people had taken exception to the album, its lyrics and the band's imagery, and asked would he be interested to discuss this on television with members of the clergy. Mendonca accepted thinking, \\"it was a serious debate, with a serious presenter of note conducting a proper interview,\\" which was assured by the producer. In mid-May 2007 Metal Hammer magazine spoken to Mendonca about the furore surrounding Antichrist. Mendonca talked about the censorship in the United States, where the album run into more controversy when the pressing plant handling its production, Disc USA, refused to print the CD booklet due its \\"Satanic\\" and \\"anti-Christian\\" perspective. Mendonca stated that the fact sounded like fascism to him and questioned the US censorship, saying: \\"I rather perturbed that in this day and age, the 21st century, people are so uptight. Whatever happened to freedom of speech and freedom of expression in the alleged democracy of the USA? Censorship is always ugly no matter how you view it.\\" Mendonca observed that judging something (literally) by its cover, such as in the attitude of the printers is typical of the brainwashed. \\"Anyone who took the time to look into [Akercocke's] history would recognise that we have always stated we are anything but anti-Christian. It is divisive attitudes such as this that bring about conflict. Conflict through ignorance.\\" With Akercocke's gig in Belfast scheduled for Friday 18 May, BBC Northern Ireland's producers arranged a video link up to take place the Wednesday before. Shortly after the show at Rock City, the band's Mendonca and Gray appeared on the debate, but they had a four-second delay on their satellite link and could not hear what people were saying. As Terrorizer magazine pointed out, \\"viewers expecting a decent debate about censorship and religion witnessed Gray and Mendonca heading off criticism from both the audience and furious Christian panellists.\\" During the debate, Mendonca said he wanted to challenge the idea that just because Akercocke play satanically motivated music, they are anti-Christian. In response, a Christian panellist promised Mendonca that he would pray for him \\"on the day you wake up in a pool of your own vomit.\\" Terrorizer magazine further commented that \\"what could have been a heated debate between good and evil rapidly descended into farce.\\" The band also appeared on Nolan's radio programme, The Stephen Nolan Show, on the early morning of 17 May. Although a more measured and listenable debate took place, excitement continued to build with threats of Christian protests rumoured on the web. In the wake of a controversy, Akercocke's gig in Belfast was in danger of being cancelled. The police embargoed the gig demanding to see the band's lyrics before letting them go on stage. Despite Christian protests outside the venue and police embargo, the gig proceeded without any trouble.  Release  In early-January 2007, the band released footage from the recordings through YouTube, and announced that the expected release date of Antichrist was for 14 May through Earache Records. Akercocke officially announced the title of the album in mid- March, along with its release date that had been postponed to 28 May.

It is bordered to the south by the edge of the towns of Exmouth and Budleigh Salterton, the hamlet of Yettington to the east, and the A3052 to the north. It is part of the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Within the common is Woodbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort situated on a viewpoint overlooking westwards the villages of Woodbury and Woodbury Salterton and across the Exe estuary to the Haldon Hills, and overlooking eastwards the Otter Valley, part of the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The heathland has wide swathes of gorse and heather (bell, cross-leaved and ling varieties) and is a popular spot for orienteering, hill-walking, mountain biking and flying radio- controlled aircraft. It has a wide variety of wildlife, in particular the Nightjar, which migrates from Africa each year. The common contains a training ground for the Royal Marines, part of the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines based at nearby Lympstone in the parish of Woodbury. To the north end of Woodbury Common is the Woodbury Park Hotel, Golf and Country Club complex established by former Formula One driver Nigel Mansell.Woodbury Park Hotel, Golf and Country Club The Battle of Woodbury Common, 1549 The Battle of Woodbury Common, which took place on 4 August 1549, was part of the Prayer Book Rebellion. Reinforcements in the form of Italian mercenaries and German Landsknechts under the command of Lord William Grey arrived on 2 August to assist the king's troops under John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford., who was charged with defeating a large force of rebelling men from Cornwall and Devon. The next day, the king's army of some 5,000 men began a march from Honiton to relieve Exeter, which was under siege at the time, but instead of taking the heavily barricaded highway, Russell went westward, across the downs. Russell's scouts found their way barred by 2,000 men at Alphington and sent in Captain Travers to clear the road. In the words of Edward VI's chronicler, John Hayward, those Cornishmen who were disarmed in this assault were \\"slain like beasts\\". Russell's advance continued onto Woodbury Common, where he pitched camp at a windmill. Here, Paulo Batista Spinola, the Italian commander, kept his men awake all night, fearing a night attack. This actually occurred at dawn the next day, on 4 August, when Devonian and Cornish forces defending Clyst St Mary came out to confront the larger force at the windmill. The difference in numbers and force of arms did nothing to deter them and the second battle of the uprising began. There were heavy losses on both sides and the result was inconclusive but Russell's army took many prisoners, 900 of whom were executed the next day in the Clyst Heath massacre. This number was confirmed by John Hayward.Cornish World - War of June-August 1549Philip Payton. (1996). Cornwall.

Early life Liza spent her childhood in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Her parents had been removed from their native village of Katyr-Yurt, Chechnya in February 1944 as a result of the forced deportations of most Chechens to Central Asia. In 1982, her father decided to move the family back to Chechnya, and they settled in Grozny that year. Career Liza attended the Yaroslavl Drama Institute, where she developed a solid reputation for her emotive singing, yet declined a musical career upon graduation to get married, and shortly afterwards became the mother of three children. In 1994 the family moved to Moscow after their house was bombed during the First Chechen War. In Moscow she opened up a small business called 'Vaynaham', which sold Chechen and Ingush literature and audio recordings. During this time, Liza separated from her husband and struggled to raise their children by herself. In 1998 Liza made her first recording with the song \\"Motherland\\", which set words about Chechnya to the tune of \\"Liberta\\", a 1980s hit by Italian pop duo Al Bano and Romina Power. \\"I think it cost $50 [to make the recording],\\" she said. \\"I was sewing, earning money to feed the children at that time.

Vinod Kumar (Dilip Kumar) plays a respected, law-abiding citizen who turns to crime for exacting revenge. The movie was based on the well-known Marathi play Ashroonchi Zhali Phule written by famous Marathi writer Vasant Kanetkar.http://movies.ndtv.com/photos/dilip-kumar-93-how-he-conquered- bollywood-21122#photo-268388 The movie was remade in Malayalam as Ithile Iniyum Varu with Mamooty playing the lead role.  Plot  Vinod Kumar (Dilip Kumar) is an upright and honest man, who runs a newspaper named \\"Mashaal\\". Vinod exposes the ills in the society with help of his newspaper. Vinod's wife, Sudha (Waheeda Rehman), sees a vagabond named Raja (Anil Kapoor) and tries to instill some values and culture in him. Vinod is sceptical about this, but accepts when Raja tells them of his tragic childhood and comes to regard Sudha as a maternal figure. Finally, Vinod decides to help Raja by sending him to Bangalore to complete his education and become a journalist. During frequent meetings with Vinod and Sudha, Raja befriends Geeta (Rati Agnihotri), an aspiring journalist and an assistant in Vinod's paper, and they fall in love. During his investigations, Vinod finds that S.K. Vardhan (Amrish Puri), a wealthy and respected man in the society, is behind many malpractices. Vinod starts exposing S.K's illicit business of drug-trafficking and selling hooch. Initially, S.K. tries to buy Vinod's silence by bribing him, but when Vinod decides to stand up to S.K., the latter inflicts misery on Vinod by having him thrown out of his rented house via the landlord. That very night, Vinod's newspaper office is burnt down by S.K.'s men. Helpless, and on the streets, tragedy strikes Vinod and Sudha further when Sudha, who is ailing, dies on the road, leaving Vinod distraught and heartbroken. A disillusioned Vinod realizes that S.K. will always trump him, since people also support him. Instead of trying to expose S.K., Vinod now decides to follow S.K's footsteps in order to destroy him. Vinod, in association with Kishorilal (Saeed Jaffrey), starts to produce illicit hooch and engages in other illegal businesses to earn money ‚Äì the thing, Vinod retrospectively feels, he lacked, and the shortage of which led to the tragedies in his life. Soon, Vinod becomes rich. Meanwhile, Raja, who is in Bangalore for his studies, is unaware of these developments. The only other person exposed to this truth is Geeta, who has grown resentful of Vinod and has started to work in another newspaper. Vinod's business now stands as a threat to Vardhan's empire. Soon, Raja returns after completing his education and meets Vinod and is surprised to see that the latter's lifestyle has changed, but doesn't know the truth. Raja meets Munna (Gulshan Grover), an old friend, from whom he learns that a new crime lord has entered the fray and has gained a foothold in the hooch and drugs world. Raja decides to expose this criminal, who, unbeknownst to him, is Vinod himself. Vinod is disturbed to learn that Raja is trying to dismantle his empire, but does not stop him. Raja starts working for Dinesh (Alok Nath), another journalist for whom Geeta also works. A chance discussion between Raja, Dinesh and Geeta leads to the revelation that Vinod is, indeed, the new drug boss. Raja is flummoxed upon learning this, and goes to meet Vinod to confront him about this. Vinod accepts the truth, and tells him what happened. After an emotional upheaval and deep pondering, Raja decides that he will continue on the righteous path Vinod taught him, even if this means exposing the very person, who treated him as his own son, as a criminal. Vinod feels humbled when Raja tells him that he still views Vinod as his mentor, upon which Vinod gives him his blessings to continue his chosen work. Meanwhile, Vinod and S.K's enmity reaches a head when Raja starts writing about both. Finally, S.K kidnaps Raja and threatens him. Vinod enters and saves Raja, before fighting with S.K. Vinod kills S.K by throwing him in printing press wheels. Keshav, a henchman of S.K, tries to shoot Raja, but Vinod comes in between and gets fatally shot.

Because it takes boats approximately one week to complete the circuit, it is suited to narrowboat holidays that start at and return to the same location. The route has 92 locks and is long. It passes through contrasting landscapes between Manchester city centre and rural Cheshire with views of the Peak District and the Cheshire Plain. History The term \\"Cheshire Ring\\" first appeared in the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) Bulletin in 1965, where it was coined as part of a campaign to prevent the abandonment of, and restore navigation to, part of what had been known as the Peak Forest Circular Route between Manchester and Marple. When commercial carrying declined after the Second World War, sections of the Rochdale, Ashton and Peak Forest Canals that make up the urban part of the ring had gradually fallen into disuse, and by the early 1960s were impassable, with little depth of water and many locks in an unusable condition. There was a risk that the canals would be abandoned, and infilled, as they were becoming stinking eyesores. Perseverance by the IWA and the Peak Forest Canal Society paid off, and on 1 April 1974, following restoration, the ring was re-opened to navigation. The Rochdale Canal (unlike most other canals in England) was not nationalised in 1947, and remained in the ownership of the Rochdale Canal Company. Both the Rochdale Canal and Bridgewater Canal escaped nationalisation as a result of being owned subsidiaries of the Manchester Ship Canal company. In 2002, as part of the restoration of the Rochdale, ownership of the Rochdale Canal Company passed to the Waterways Trust, and British Waterways became the navigation authority, bringing to an end the ¬£35 toll that had been charged to use the one-mile section through Manchester which had deterred some boats from attempting the ring. Cheshire Ring Race Since 1977, a marathon-style race has been organized called the Cheshire Ring Race. Traversing five canals, it starts and finishes at Higher Poynton on the Macclesfield Canal. Participation is open to individual paddlers, crew boats and relay teams. The race is held under the aegis of Macclesfield And District Canoe Club (MADCC).

He was one of the strongest American players of the 1930s, and was part of the American team which won the gold medals at the 1933 Chess Olympiad. Simonson was certainly at least of International Master strength, based on his limited playing career. Biography Simonson was born into a wealthy family. His father Leo was a successful wigmaker to the Manhattan rich and the theatre and movie businesses. His mother Irene was from the family that owned the Illinois Watch Case Co. in Elgin, Illinois. . Simonson showed precocious skill with chess, soon after learning the game. At New York 1933, he scored 7/10 to tie for 2nd-3rd places, behind only winner Reuben Fine. This earned him selection to the United States chess Olympiad team at age 18. In the Olympiad, at Folkestone 1933, he played on the first reserve board and scored 3/6, as the Americans won the team gold medals. Simonson's teammates were Fine, Isaac Kashdan, Arthur Dake, and Frank Marshall, who all eventually became Grandmasters. In the 17th Championship of the Marshall Chess Club, 1933‚Äì34, Simonson scored 7/11 to finish 6th. In the 1935 U.S. Open at Milwaukee, he scored 5.5/10 to tie for 4th-6th places. In the first modern U.S. Chess Championship, New York City 1936, Simonson placed second with 11/15, behind only winner Samuel Reshevsky. He scored 11/16 in the 1938 United States Championship at New York, to finish third, behind Reshevsky and Fine. In the United States Championship of 1940, again at New York, he tied for 4th-5th places, with 10/16, behind Reshevsky, Fine, and Isaac Kashdan. However, in the 1951 U.S. Championship in New York, Simonson finished tied for 11th-12th, with only 3.5/11. His total in four U.S. Championships was 35.5/58, for 61.2 per cent. Simonson defeated Reshevsky in a Metropolitan League team match in 1950, at a time when Reshevsky was among the world's top five players. Simonson was ranked sixth in the country on the very first official rating list, issued in 1950, from the United States Chess Federation. Simonson was a pioneer in the direct mail business field. He served with the United States Army during World War II, attaining the rank of Sergeant. According to his close friend, Grandmaster Arnold Denker, from the acclaimed book by Denker and Larry Parr -- The Bobby Fischer I Knew And Other Stories‚ÄîSimonson was very skilled at indoor card and board games, but had a serious gambling problem. He was married three times, and fathered three children. There is a small selection of his games at chessbase.com. Notable chess games *Leonhard Abramavicius vs Albert Simonson, Folkestone Olympiad 1933, King's Indian Defence, Fianchetto Variation (E62), 0-1 In this gorgeous game, Simonson unleashes a nasty Kingside attack using strategy which would start to become popular a few years later. *Reuben Fine vs Albert Simonson, U.S. Championship, New York 1936, Queen's Gambit Declined, Delayed Exchange (Three Knights') Variation (D37), 0-1 Fine and Samuel Reshevsky were the top American players of the 1930s, but here Fine gets overambitious, and is taken apart by Simonson's counterattack. *Albert Simonson vs Herman Steiner, U.S. Championship, New York 1936, King's Indian Attack / Zukertort Opening (A05), 1-0 White gradually builds up his position against the formidable tactician Steiner. *Albert Simonson vs Arnold Denker, U.S. Championship, New York 1936, Queen's Indian Defence (E19), 1-0 Denker forces the pace with queenside activity, but gets outplayed once the minor pieces are exchanged, as White's passed a-pawn is a distraction which forces open lines. *Weaver Adams vs Albert Simonson, U.S. Championship, New York 1940, Bishop's Opening (C24), 0-1 This is a real tactical slugfest with castling on opposite sides, but Simonson sees further. *Albert Simonson vs Albert Pinkus, U.S. Championship, New York 1951, Queen's Gambit Declined (D46), 1-0 In this battle between two razor-sharp tacticians, Simonson takes a huge risk by leaving his King in the centre, and launches a nasty h-file attack which hits paydirt.

It takes the form of a review of John Adolphus Etzler's book The Paradise within the Reach of all Men, without Labor, by Powers of Nature and Machinery: An Address to all intelligent men, in two parts, which had come out in a new edition the previous year. The essay amplifies such Thoreauvian themes as imploring people to self-betterment and a distrust of humanity's attempts to improve upon nature.  Summary  Etzler's book is technological utopianism taken to amazing extremes. Etzler believed that the technology of his time was adequate, if astutely applied, to usher in a paradise on earth in which nobody would need to toil, all needs would be provided, and the earth would be transformed into palaces and gardens. He just needed about ten years and some start-up financing; the blueprints were already written up. Thoreau's review includes several lengthy excerpts from Etzler's book that give a good feel for its contents and its bombast. To a large extent, Thoreau lets the book review itself through these demonstrative excerpts, only occasionally stopping to advance a minor technical quibble against a grandiose technological extrapolation or to experiment with going even further out on Etzler's limb. Thoreau sees Etzler's mad utopian dreams as being something like the unstated and unconscious wishes of the more moderate and practical technological utopians of his timethe trajectory wished for (but never out loud) by the Industrial Revolutionaries and scientists and reformers: \\"Let us not succumb to nature. We will marshal the clouds and restrain tempests; we will bottle up pestilent exhalations; we will probe for earthquakes, grub them up, and give vent to the dangerous gas; we will disembowel the volcano, and extract its poison, take its seed out.\\" And why stop there? > We will wash water, and warm fire, and cool ice, and underprop the earth. We > will teach birds to fly, and fishes to swim, and ruminants to chew the cud. > It is time we had looked into these things. Ralph Waldo Emerson had recommended Etzler's book to Thoreau and suggested that he write the review. Emerson himself had been impressed enough by Etzler's technological prescience to worry about whether the vast energy and machinery of the future would make the working class obsolete and endangered. As Thoreau sees it (once he gets the review behind him and starts letting his own philosophy take center stage) the problem is not that we have not applied sufficient energy and technology to put our great schemes into action, but that we have not energetically applied ourselves to improve our schemes. Etzler would have a person harness the wind, waves, sun, and moon who hasn't even developed self-control. > Thus is Paradise to be Regained, and that old and stern decree at length > reversed. Man shall no more earn his living by the sweat of his brow. All > labor shall be reduced to \\"a short turn of some crank,\\" and \\"taking the > finished article away.\\" But there is a crank,oh, how hard to be turned! > Could there not be a crank upon a crank,an infinitely small crank?we would > fain inquire. No,alas! not. But there is a certain divine energy in every > man, but sparingly employed as yet, which may be called the crank within,the > crank after all,the prime mover in all machinery,quite indispensable to all > work. Would that we might get our hands on its handle!  Notes  On-line text  * * Paradise (to be) Regained at The Picket Line  Printed sources  * My Thoughts are Murder to the State by H.D.

The Cumulus Media outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 107.5 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 40 kW. The station goes by the name 107-5 The Game. Its studios are located in downtown Columbia, SC and the transmitter is west of St. Matthews, South Carolina. History 107.5 signed on January 5, 1971 as WDWQ in St. George, a Charleston suburb. It was the FM sister to WQIZ. The FM station was sold in 1977 to a Washington, DC-based group that moved the studios to North Charleston and flipped the station to top 40 as \\"Q107\\" under the WKQB call sign. The \\"Q107\\" moniker was briefly dropped in 1984 for \\"Power 107\\" but Q107 was reclaimed one year later. Q107 eventually topped rival CHR WSSX as the #1 CHR in the market on several occasions in the later half in the 1980s under a Dance-leaning CHR format. Q107 gained fame in September 1989 as it broadcast continuously during Hurricane Hugo's landfall in the Charleston area. The transmitter was located further inland than most Charleston stations, allowing Q107 to stay on the air long after the other stations lost power. The broadcast ended when the station lost power at the transmitter site. Although there was a generator at the studios, there was no generator at the St. George tower site. The staff never left the studios; in fact the station personnel, their families and pets camped out in the radio station awaiting the return of power. The station returned to the air after the storm passed and broadcast vital information to area residents for weeks afterward. Unfortunately, Q107 entered the 1990s under serious hardship. The station shut down in early 1991 and simulcasted for a brief time with WSUY in order to stay on the air. WKQB was eventually sold in 1991 to a new owner, which took the station to classic-leaning country music under the call-letters of WBUB as \\"Bubba 107.5\\" in the Spring of 1991. In 1997, the station was sold to Citadel Broadcasting as the station dropped the \\"Bubba 107.5\\" handle for \\"Cat Country 107.5\\" under the WNKT call letters. On July 5, 2007, WNKT was issued a construction permit to move the station to Eastover, a Columbia suburb. On November 10, 2007, WNKT dropped its country format for a continuous loop of the song \\"The Dance\\" by Garth Brooks, interspaced with liners redirecting listeners to sister country station WIWF. After two days, the station's over the air signal in Charleston was turned off in preparation for the move to Columbia. WNKT's online stream, however, remained intact, and continued to play Garth Brooks' \\"The Dance.\\" On November 12, 2007 at 1:07 p.m., WNKT signed back on from Columbia as \\"107-5 The Game\\" adopting a sports talk format. The move included a power reduction from 100,000 watts to 40,000. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. As part of the deal, WNKT became the flagship station of the South Carolina Gamecocks. In 2013, WNKT switched from Fox Sports Radio to CBS Sports Radio.

Longstanding VUR can result in small and scarred kidneys during the first five years of life in affected children. The end results of reflux nephropathy can include high blood pressure, excessive protein loss in the urine, and eventually kidney failure. When reflux nephropathy is suspected as a cause of kidney disease, other conditions to consider include chronic pyelonephritis, obstructive uropathy, and analgesic overuse. The term \\"reflux nephropathy\\" was introduced in 1973. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of reflux nephropathy are comparable to nephrotic syndrome and infection of the urinary tract, though some individuals may not exhibit any evidence (symptom) of reflux nephropathy. Cause The abnormal retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into one or both the ureters leads to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is a direct consequence of incompetent and mislocated ureterovesical valves. Reflux nephropathy is a direct consequence of VUR or other urologic congenital anomalies stemming from chronic high-pressure sterile urine reflux and often leads to recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the early childhood.Aeddula NR, Baradhi KM. Reflux Nephropathy. [Updated 2018 Sep 23]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2018 Jan-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526055/ Pathophysiology The underlying calyces lose their normal concave shape and show clubbing. Diagnosis It is diagnosed by micturating cystography; scarring can be demonstrated by ultrasound or DMSA. Treatment The aim of treatment is to reduce renal scarring. Those children with grade II or worse should receive low dose prophylactic antibiotics (Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, cefalexin in those with CRF). Hypertension should be managed with ACE inhibitor or ARBs. Other treatment modalities include surgery (endoscopic injection of collagen behind the intra-vesical ureter, ureteric re-implantation or lengthening of the submucosal ureteric tunnel) which has its protagonists. Epidemiology There is a genetic predisposition, first- degree relatives have a great increase in the chance of VUR. The gene frequency is estimated to be 1:600. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children from 2 to 24 months presenting with a UTI should be investigated for VUR.

Doing this quickly has applications in cryptography. The difficulty depends on both the size and form of the number and its prime factors; it is currently very difficult to factorize large semiprimes (and, indeed, most numbers which have no small factors).  Numbers of a general form  The first enormous distributed factorisation was RSA-129, a challenge number described in the Scientific American article of 1977 which first popularised the RSA cryptosystem. It was factorised between September 1993 and April 1994, using MPQS, with relations contributed by about 600 people through the internet, and the final stages of the calculation performed on a MasPar supercomputer at Bell Labs. Between January and August 1999, RSA-155, a challenge number prepared by the RSA company, was factorised using GNFS with relations again contributed by a large group, and the final stages of the calculation performed in just over nine days on the Cray C916 supercomputer at the SARA Amsterdam Academic Computer Center. In January 2002, Franke et al. announced the factorisation of a 158-digit cofactor of 2953+1, using a couple of months on about 25 PCs at the University of Bonn, with the final stages done using a cluster of six Pentium-III PCs. In April 2003, the same team factored RSA-160 using about a hundred CPUs at BSI, with the final stages of the calculation done using 25 processors of an SGI Origin supercomputer. The 576-bit RSA-576 was factored by Franke, Kleinjung and members of the NFSNET collaboration in December 2003, using resources at BSI and the University of Bonn; soon afterwards, Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama, Sonoda and Ueda announced that they had factored a 164-digit cofactor of 21826+1. A 176-digit cofactor of 11281+1 was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between February and May 2005 using machines at NTT and Rikkyo University in Japan. The 663-bit RSA-200 challenge number was factored by Franke, Kleinjung et al. between December 2003 and May 2005, using a cluster of 80 Opteron processors at BSI in Germany; the announcement was made on 9 May 2005. They later (November 2005) factored the slightly smaller RSA-640 challenge number. On December 12, 2009, a team including researchers from the CWI, the EPFL, INRIA and NTT in addition to the authors of the previous record factored RSA-768, a 232-digit semiprime. They used the equivalent of almost 2000 years of computing on a single core 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron. In November 2019, the 795-bit RSA-240 was factored by Fabrice Boudot, Pierrick Gaudry, Aurore Guillevic, Nadia Heninger, Emmanuel Thom√© and Paul Zimmermann.https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/cado-nfs- discuss/2019-December/001139.html F.

In February 2020, the factorization of the 829-bit RSA-250 was completed.https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;dc42ccd1.2002  Numbers of a special form  12151 ‚àí 1, of 542 bits (163 digits), was factored between April and July 1993 by a team at CWI and Oregon State University. 2773 + 1, of 774 bits (233 digits), was factored between April and November 2000 by 'The Cabal', with the matrix step done over 250 hours on the Cray also used for RSA-155. 2809 ‚àí 1, of 809 bits (244 digits), had its factorisation announced at the start of January 2003. Sieving was done at the CWI, at the Scientific Computing Institute and the Pure Mathematics Department at Bonn University, and using private resources of J. Franke, T. Kleinjung and the family of F. Bahr. The linear algebra step was done by P. Montgomery at SARA in Amsterdam. 6353 ‚àí 1, of 911 bits (275 digits), was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between September 2005 and January 2006 using SNFS. 21039 ‚àí 1, of 1039 bits (313 digits) (though a factor of 23 bits was already known) was factored between September 2006 and May 2007 by a group including K. Aoki, J. Franke, T. Kleinjung, A. K. Lenstra and D. A. Osvik, using computers at NTT, EPFL and the University of Bonn. 21061 ‚àí 1, of 1061 bits (320 digits) was factored between early 2011 and 4 August 2012 by a group headed by Greg Childers at CSU Fullerton, using the nfs@home BOINC project for about 300 CPU-years of sieving; the linear algebra was run at the Trestles cluster at SDSC and the Lonestar cluster at TACC and needed additional 35 CPU- years. All unfactored parts of the numbers 2n ‚àí 1 with n between 1000 and 1200 were factored by a multiple-number-sieve approach in which much of the sieving step could be done simultaneously for multiple numbers, by a group including T. Kleinjung, J. Bos and A. K. Lenstra, starting in 2010. To be precise, n=1081 was completed on 11 March 2013; n=1111 on 13 June 2013; n=1129 on 20 September 2013; n=1153 on 28 October 2013; n=1159 on 9 February 2014; 1177 on May 29, 2014, n=1193 on 22 August 2014, and n=1199 on December 11, 2014; the first detailed announcement was made in late August 2014. The total effort for the project is of the order of 7500 CPU-years on 2.2 GHz Opterons, with roughly 5700 years spent sieving and 1800 years on linear algebra. Comparison to efforts by individuals As of the end of 2007, thanks to the constant decline in memory prices, the ready availability of multi-core 64-bit computers, and the availability of the efficient sieving code (developed by Thorsten Kleinjung of the Bonn group) via ggnfs and of robust open-source software such as msieve for the finishing stages, special-form numbers of up to 750 bits and general-form numbers of up to about 520 bits can be factored in a few months on a few PCs by a single person without any special mathematical experience. These bounds increase to about 950 and 600 if it were possible to secure the collaboration of a few dozen PCs for sieving; currently the amount of memory and the CPU power of a single machine for the finishing stage are equal barriers to progress. In 2009, Benjamin Moody factored a 512-bit RSA key used to sign the TI-83 graphing calculator using software found on the internet; this eventually led to the Texas Instruments signing key controversy. In September 2013, the 696-bit RSA-210 was factored by Ryan Propper using institutional resources; between March 2013 and October 2014, another 210-digit number (the 117th term in the 'home prime sequence' starting with 49) was completed by a user known as WraithX, using $7600 worth of processing time on Amazon EC2 machineshttps://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=389078&postcount;=105 for the sieving, and four months on a dual Xeon E5-2687W v1 for the linear algebra. Records for efforts by quantum computers The largest number factored by Shor's algorithm was 21 in 2012. 15 had previously been factored by several labs. In April 2012, the factorization of 143=13\\\\times11 by a room temperature (300K) NMR adiabatic quantum computer was reported by a group led by Xinhua Peng. In November 2014 it was discovered by Nike Dattani and Nathan Bryans that the 2012 experiment had in fact also factored much larger numbers without knowing it. In April 2016 the 18-bit number 200 099 was factored using quantum annealing on a D-Wave 2X quantum processor. Shortly after, 291 311 was factored using NMR at higher than room temperature. In late 2019, an industry collaboration found 1,099,551,473,989 is equal to 1,048,589 multiplied by 1,048,601.

Able Edwards follows the clone of a Walt Disneyesque entertainment mogul created to revive the glory days of his deceased predecessor's corporation. In the process of restoring reality entertainment to a synthetic, virtual world, the clone realizes he has yet to live as his own man. Plot In the not so distant future, the world is faced with a global catastrophe. A biological contaminant is released into the atmosphere and over the following years, decimates nearly ninety percent of the world's population. Fleeing the poisoned planet, humanity relocates to a space station orbiting the Earth. It is there that life continues with the hope of one day returning to Earth. The film unfolds during the probate hearing determining the disposition of assets of the estate of Abel Edwards beta, the clone of the founder of the Edwards Corporation (EC), the most successful entertainment conglomerate of the 20th Century. The EC included an enormously successful film and television studio and the Abel Edwards' Fantastic Wonderlands Theme Parks based on the characters populating Abel Edwards' animated films. The EC has an extensive animatronic background and has morphed into a manufacturer whose significant product is the humanoid robot; their market share has fallen sharply and sales have softened. They understand the need to develop a new market, but after several failed attempts, recognize they lack the intuition and imagination necessary for the success of such a bold course change. As a last-ditch effort, their marketing department develops a plan to clone their dead genius founder, Abel Edwards. They will grow a genetic replica, and they will infuse him with the same life-altering experiences that shaped the original man. Nature plus nurture, or something like it. Upon his 25th birthday, Edwards takes the reins of the company and rides a 20-year wave of success with every passing day. When the potential rival of the status quo career politician abruptly drops out of the race, Edwards sees his chance to expand beyond his defined boundaries and bring the 'Edwards Standard of Living' directly into people's living rooms, rather than maintaining a park to give them a transitory experience. When Edwards moves from a 'Celebrity Politician' to a front-running candidate, the power struggle reaches its breaking point. The Anti-Reality Organizations finally have their scapegoat. He loses the Senate race in a landslide. Edwards has lost his son, the Senate seat and his position as CEO of the company.

She is the Hale G. Smith Professor of Anthropology and a Distinguished Research Professor at Florida State University. Career As an undergraduate, Falk studied mathematics and anthropology. Since receiving her PhD from the University of Michigan in 1976, she has taught courses in anatomy, neuroanatomy, and anthropology. Falk is interested in the evolution of the brain and cognition. She formulated the ‚Äúradiator theory‚Äù that cranial blood vessels were important for hominin brain evolution, and the ‚Äúputting the baby down‚Äù hypothesis that prehistoric mothers and infants facilitated the emergence of language. She and colleagues described the brain of Homo floresiensis (\\"Hobbit\\") in 2005. In 2013, Falk and colleagues described the cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein from recently emerged photographs of his whole brain. In 2017, Falk coauthored a study with Charles Hildebolt on warfare in small-scale and state societies, which found that people are no less violent today than they were in the past. Falk coauthored a 2018 book on Asperger's syndrome with her 24-year-old granddaughter who has Asperger's,Jen Pinkowski, \\"Tracing the Evolution of the Human Brain Through Casts of the Inner Skull\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôMental ‚Äò‚ÄôFloss, October 25, 2015 and, in 2019, published a refutation of the allegation that Hans Asperger was a Nazi sympathizer. This was in turn refuted by the original author, Herwig Czech, who opined that Falk's paper abounded \\"with mistranslations, misrepresentations of the content of sources, and basic factual errors, and omits everything that does not support the author‚Äôs agenda of defending Hans Asperger‚Äôs record.\\" He declared that the paper should never have passed the peer review process and should be retracted.Czech, H. (2019). Response to ‚ÄòNon-complicit: Revisiting Hans Asperger‚Äôs Career in Nazi-era Vienna.‚Äô Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 49(9), pp 3883‚Äì3887. Available at: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04106-w Homo floresiensis After the skeletal remains of a \\"Hobbit\\"-sized human (museum number LB1) that are now dated to over 65,000 years ago were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 they were identified as a new species labelled Homo floresiensis (‚ÄúHobbit‚Äù). Some scientists thought that the specimen must have been a pygmy or a microcephalic ‚Äî a human with an abnormally small skull. Falk undertook a collaborative study in 2005 that described Hobbit's endocast and supported the claim that the find represented a new species. Falk's 2005 study was criticized by other experts. In response, in 2007 with an international team of experts, Falk compared detailed maps of imprints left on the ancient hominid's braincase (endocasts) with those from microcephalic individuals and concluded that LB1, indeed, represented a new species that may have been descended from either Homo erectus or an earlier small-bodied hominin. Falk's team have repeatedly asserted that their findings confirm that the species cataloged as LB1, Homo floresiensis, is definitely not a human born with microcephalia ‚Äî a somewhat rare pathological condition that still occurs today. She has also participated in other studies that refute the idea that LB1 had Laron syndrome or Down syndrome. Today, most experts do not think that LB1 was a diseased human. As noted by Westaway et al. (MC Westaway et al. [2015]. Mandibular evidence supports Homo floresiensis as a distinct species. PNAS 112[7], E604-E605), \\"Many interesting questions about the Liang Bua fossils remain unanswered, but whether LB1 is a pathological H. sapiens is not one of them\\". Human Brain Evolution In 2014, Dean Falk published her work on \\"Interpreting sulci on hominin endocasts: old hypotheses and new findings in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience\\". Her work summarized what paleoneurologists could potentially learn about human brain evolution from fossils, which is confined to information about the evolution of brain size and how limited parts of the cerebral cortex became reorganized during evolution. Falk noted that the cerebral cortex is a highly evolved part of the human brain and that it facilitates conscious thought, planning, language, social skills, and scientific, artistic, and musical creativity. The cerebral cortex may leave imprints in skulls which are sometimes reproduced on endocasts. Falk observed that these studies exclude the internal brain structures that cannot be described by paleoneurologists because they do not show up on endocasts. These parts of the brain also evolved, and they are extremely important for processing memories, gut-level feelings, and social interactions in ways that set humans apart from other animals. In 2018, Falk and colleagues published an in vivo MRI study of the cerebral cortices of eight adult chimpanzees in which they identified sulcal patterns and compared them to those known from australopithecines and Homo naledi. This study showed that the frontal lobe sulcal patterns of australopiths (and H. naledi) were not derived compared to extant apes, contrary to Falk's 2014 paper.

Lawless was a forward who represented Bray Wanderers, St Patrick's Athletic, Bohemian F.C. (2 spells), Derry City F.C., Waterford United and Drogheda United during his career in the League of Ireland. He also had a spell in the Irish League on loan to Omagh Town. He is one of a select few to have won both the FAI Junior Cup (with Cherry Orchard F.C.) and FAI Senior Cup. He went to Glenmalure Park at U17 level and spent two seasons in the reserves under Eamon Dunphy. Frustrated at his lack of opportunities he moved back to Cherry Orchard. He moved into the League of Ireland ranks in January 1986 when he moved from Orchard to Bray Wanderers. He made his League of Ireland debut for Bray on 19 January in a 2-1 win away to E.M.F.A. He made 5 appearances in the league that season as Bray clinched promotion to the Premier Division. After 2 seasons with Wanderers, he moved to Dalymount Park and Bohemians in 1987. He was on the move once again in 1989 when he moved to St. Pats where he picked a League winners medal that season. He returned to Bohs for a 2nd spell in 1991 and helped to a FAI Cup victory that season.Irish Times, 10 May 1992 He scored 9 times in 31 league appearances that season for the \\"Gypsies\\" - his best ever scoring return. After a loan spell at Omagh at the beginning of the 1993/94 season, Joe headed to the Brandywell and signed for Derry City in October 1993. He picked up another winners medal that season by winning the League Cup. However, he was soon on the move once again when he signed for Waterford United and narrowly missed out on collecting the only domestic medal he hadn't got when his old club Bray beat Waterford in the final of the 1995 League of Ireland First Division Shield. He then moved to Drogheda United where he picked up a severe ligament injury which ended his league of Ireland career.

After having obtained the general certificate of education from the girls' high school run by the Association for the Extended Education of Women in 1922, she studied first chemistry, then physics at the University of Vienna. Wambacher's dissertation at the 2nd Physics Institute was supervised by Marietta Blau, with whom Wambacher continued to collaborate also after her Ph.D. graduation in 1932. The cooperation of the two women referred to the photographic method of detecting ionizing particles. For their methodical studies at the Institute for Radium Research of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, Blau and Wambacher received the Lieben Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1937. Also in 1937, Blau and Wambacher jointly discovered \\"disintegration stars\\" in photographic plates that had been exposed to cosmic radiation at an altitude of 2300 m above sea level. These stars are the patterns of particle tracks from nuclear reactions (spallation events) of cosmic-ray particles with nuclei of the photographic emulsion. After Blau had to leave Austria in 1938, Hertha Wambacher continued working on the identification of particles from nuclear reactions of cosmic rays with the emulsion constituents. With this work, she obtained her university teaching certification in 1940. She taught classes at the University of Vienna. In 1945, Wambacher who ‚Äì according to her own words ‚Äì had belonged to the NSDAP since 1934, was removed from the University of Vienna. She was detained in Russia and is said to have returned only in 1946. She contracted cancer, but was still able to work in a research laboratory in Vienna.

The civilization's cities were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and new techniques in handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). Its large urban centres of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to containing between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation itself during its florescence may have contained between one and five million individuals.  Town planning  Regularity of streets and buildings suggests the influence of ancient urban planning in Mohenjo-daro's construction. Mohenjo-daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan.Mohan Pant and Shjui Fumo, \\"The Grid and Modular Measures in The Town Planning of Mohenjodaro and Kathmandu Valley: A Study on Modular Measures in Block and Plot Divisions in the Planning of Mohenjodaro and Sirkap (Pakistan), and Thimi (Kathmandu Valley)\\"; Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering 59, May 2005. Most were built of fired and mortared brick; some incorporated sun-dried mud-brick and wooden superstructures. Sites were often raised, or built on man made hills. This could be to combat flooding in the nearby areas. Another aspect of the architecture is they often built walls around their entire cities. This could have served several different needs. Many believe that the walls were built as defensive structures, where ‚ÄúLarge and impressive construction works can be used to intimidate potential attackers (Trigger 1990),‚Äù . It was also an obvious feature to show the city was strong and powerful by being able to divert resources and labor to make such a large structure and not focus all of their energy on survival. This was not the only purpose for the wall, it is thought that the wall also served as protection from floods. There is also evidence of a tapering at the bottom of the wall to guide the water away from the city. The city could be split into two different sections: an upper \\"acropolis\\" and a \\"lower town\\". The lower town consisted of lower valued residential building located on the eastern side of the city, while the upper acropolis would be on the western side of the city which contained of the higher value buildings and public buildings. The acropolis was a ‚Äúparallelogram that was 400‚Äì500 yards north-south and 200‚Äì300 yards east-west‚Äù It was also thought that the acropolis area would be built on the highest part of the mound in the city showing the importance and status of the area was much higher than the rest of the area. Another feature which suggests the acropolis is of higher importance is that the fortifications around the area where bigger and stronger than those around the rest of the city. Cut brick from Chanhudaro (Pakistan); circa 2500-1900 BC; Royal Ontario Museum (Toronto, Canada)  Buildings and materials  The materials of houses depended on the location of the building. If the house was more rural the bricks would be mud. If the building was in an urban area then the bricks would be baked. The bricks were made in ratios of 1x2x4. ‚ÄúHouses range from 1‚Äì2 stories in height, with a central courtyard around which the rooms are arranged‚Äù  Harappan revival  The Mohenjo-daro Museum, in Pakistan There are few buildings built in the Harappan Revival style. The best well-known is the Mohenjo-daro Museum. It is made of bricks with a very similar color to the buildings from Mohenjo- daro or Harappa. One entrance has a geometric pattern made of bricks similar to those of the original gates.

Life Allan was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 17 July 1777, the son of Robert Allan (1748‚Äì1818), a banker. He was educated at the High School of Edinburgh and took up banking as profession; but he is remembered today for his contributions to mineral science. At an early age Allan became fascinated with minerals and he began to accumulate a large mineral collection that was subsequently bequeathed to his son Robert Allan FRSE. This collection was later incorporated into Robert Greg's, which was ultimately acquired by the British Museum of Natural History in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1813, Allan was influential in securing a mineralogy post in the Dublin Philosophical Society for the German mineralogist Karl Ludwig Giesecke (1761‚Äì1833). Allan was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1805, his proposers being Sir James Hall, William Wright and John Playfair. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1815. He served as Curator to the RSE 1812‚Äì20 and Treasurer 1821‚Äì33.

It covers the metropolitan area of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The council serves Lackawanna, Luzerne, Pike, Wayne, Wyoming counties, and portions of Susquehanna county. Organization The council is geographically divided into two districts to serve scout units: * Dan Beard District: includes school districts in Lackawanna, Pike, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties. * Two Mountains District: includes school districts in Luzerne and Wyoming counties. Camps The council manages two camps: Goose Pond Scout Reservation, located in Paupack Township, Pennsylvania, near Lake Wallenpaupack, and Camp Acahela, located in Tobyhanna Township, Pennsylvania, near the confluence of the Lehigh River and Tobyhanna Creek. Goose Pond Scout Reservation Goose Pond, the lake around which the whole camp is based, is a 42-acre glacial lake surrounded by hardwood and evergreen forest. The total area of the camp is which includes the lake. The camp is located near the northern end of the Pocono Plateau, Scranton.NEPA Council Site Goose Pond Scout Reservation has been in continuous operation as a boy scout summer camp since 1920. Its resident Boy Scout summer camping season runs seven weeks from late June through mid August. During summer camp, a staff of scouts provide merit badge courses that scouts can attend during the week. Registration for the summer program typically starts at the end of the previous season. The summer camp conducts the Voyager Program to offer High Adventure experiences to older scouts and the Pathways Program to give first-year campers scout skill training. During the non-summer season the camp supports events such as Order of the Arrow Ordeal weekends, Cub Scout programs, unit weekend camping, council leadership courses, and the Klondike Derby. The camp also supports a high and low COPE Course throughout the Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons. =Camp features= * 10 platform tent campsites: Beaver, Capouse, Delaware, Iroquois, Lenape, Niagara, Pawnee, Seneca, Shawnee, and Slocum. During the summer camp season, the Pawnee site is reserved for camp staff. Most of these sites were established in the early 1950s when the camp transitioned from a practice of lodging campers from all troops at a single site to its current practice of lodging campers by troops, though the Delaware and Lenape sites were established in the 2000s. The council's website notes that all of these sites are available for non-summer camping. * 1 primitive campsite: The Pioneer site is a primitive site, complete with pit latrines. Campers must bring and pitch their own tents. * The Joseph J. Jermyn Assembly Hall was built in 1923 with an expansion added in 1993. It serves as the camp's main dining facility. Hundreds of plaques donated by troops, patrols, and camp staff cover the upper walls and rafters. The earliest plaques date back to 1951. * The Dickson Lodge serves as the summer camp program's headquarters for its nature program and is available as a camping lodge in the non-summer seasons. * The Handicraft Lodge houses the summer camping program's craft-oriented merit badge courses and serves as a camping lodge in the non-summer seasons. The building was constructed in 1930. It was most recently renovated in 2009 to include a covered porch and rooms for lodge camping. * The Joseph J. Jermyn Administration Building was constructed in 1926. It houses the camp office and trading post on the first floor. The second floor contains an office for the program director and program staff, a staff lounge, and a conference room for staff and troop leader meetings. * The Shapiro-Everly Reception and First Aid Building, better known as the Health Lodge, is located right beyond the main entrance gateway to the camp. The building houses the medical officer's station and quarters and the camp director's quarters. It was constructed in 1957. In addition to the primary buildings, there are various other smaller structures such as the pavilion across from the dining hall, the Dan Beard Cabin scheduled to be completed for 2021, the Jim Naticchi Pavilion at the Scoutcraft area, the Cook's Cabin for the kitchen staff, the shower house, and the pump house. The shower house, renovated in 2014, features individual shower/restroom rooms. =Camp History highlights= William \\"Green Bar Bill\\" Hillcourt attended a Wood Badge course at Goose Pond in September 1992 by the Northeastern Pennsylvania Boy Scout Council, at which time he signed a structural support beam in the camp dining hall. Since Mr. Hillcourt departed soon afterward for a trip to Sweden, during which he died on November 9, 1992, the camp claims its Wood Badge course was the last official US Scouting event attended by William Hillcourt. Goose Pond Scout Reservation's annual summer camping program has been continuously conducted since 1920. The camp claims its summer camping program is the fourth longest running Boy Scout summer camp program in the United States.David L. Eby's research on the oldest Boy Scout camps in the United States of America identifies many of the camps founded in the US in the 1910s period. News announcements about camp closures or conversions to Cub Scout camping programs or to weekend camping programs show several of these no longer operate as Boy Scout summer camps. Camp Book II, a report from over twenty years of research on camp openings and closures that cross-references dates of camp patches for patch collectors, agrees with the dates in Eby's work and lists only four camps that started running boy scout summer camp programs earlier than Goose Pond Scout Reservation: Owasippe Scout Reservation (Twin Lake, MI), Yawgoog Scout Reservation (Rockville, RI), Camp Friedlander (Loveland, OH), and Camp Parsons (Hood Canal, WA). Of these four, based on records from Camp Book II, although it has been open since 1919, Camp Friedlander did not host a Boy Scout summer program for a continuous number of years since 1919. Early in its history, Goose Pond Scout Reservation often sent hiking contingents to Daniel Carter Beard's Outdoor School 12 miles away in Lackawaxen Township, Pennsylvania. The camp is in the process of incorporating the last log cabin (Dan Beard's 1926 Kiva style headquarters cabin) from this site into its own facilities. Camp Acahela Camp Acahela was founded in 1919. The camp is located in the village of Blakeslee, PA on a peninsula formed by the joining of the Lehigh River and the Tobyhanna Creek. The camp has a total area of 242 acres covered by a variety of landforms and vegetation, ranging from heavily wooded ridges and cliffs, to wide open parade fields, to shady groves of ancient fir trees that provide a wide variety of camping opportunities year-round for every type of Scouting unit. From 1919 until 1991 the camp hosted a boy scout summer camp program. Since 1992 the camp has offered an annual Cub Scout Resident camping program during the summer months, starting in late June. The resident program provides cub scout packs with five-day and three-day options, as well as day camping experiences. =Camp Features= * 6 Platform Tent Campsites: Blackfeet, Blackfoot, Crockett, Lucky 7, Lumberjack, and Trailwood. * 4 Primitive Campsites: Eagle's Nest, Large Pines, Pinewood, and Small Pines. * Sporting Activity Sites: BB Range, Archery Field, Swimming Pool, Obstacle Course, Activity Field. * Shower House: a new shower/restroom facility with individual rooms completed in 2017. * Dining Hall: Besides a cafeteria, the building also houses the climbing wall facility. During the non-summer season the camp supports other events such as Order of the Arrow Ordeal weekends, council training courses, and Klondike Derbies. The camp is available for weekend camping reservations. Its location offers weekend campers access to many activities in the Pocono area. Order of the Arrow Northeastern Pennsylvania Council is served by Order of the Arrow Lowwapaneu Lodge 191. The name \\"Lowwapaneu\\" contains the Lenape words for \\"north\\" and \\"east.\\" The lodge's number is based on the date of the Lodge's first charter: January 1, 1991. The lodge's original totem was a totem pole that depicted the totems of the six predecessor lodges that merged over time to form Lowwapaneu Lodge: Acahela Lodge 223 (Bear), Quekolis Lodge 316 (Whippoorwill), Gischigan Lodge 223 (Rattlesnake), Monsey Lodge 543 (Wolf), Kiminschi Lodge 542 (Maple Leaf), and Amad'ahi Lodge 542 (Two Indians in a Canoe).

In Why People Die by Suicide, Joiner posits the interpersonal theory of suicide, a three-part explanation of suicide which focuses on ability and desire. The desire to die by suicide comes from a sense of disconnection from others and lack of belonging, combined with a belief that one is a burden on others. The ability to die by suicide comes from a gradual desensitization to violence and a decreased fear of pain, combined with technical competence in one or more suicide methods. Under this model, a combination of desire and ability will precede most serious suicide attempts. Joiner holds a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin.

He hinted that there may have been an additional fourth draft that had yet to surface. The notes to the Moldenhauer, Moser & Kern version say that Metcalf \\"misread the holograph at several points, omitted occasional words and phrases, ignored some pencil cancellations, and amplified Thoreau's text with passages from the working manuscripts and from the Raleigh Works. None of these changes carry authority.\\"  Themes  The essay praises Sir Walter Raleigh as a flawed but heroic figure, who failed to use his heroic character to heroic ends. Thoreau concludes by begging America to produce such a hero: > We have considered a fair specimen of an Englishman in the sixteenth > century; but it behooves us to be fairer specimens of American men in the > nineteenth. The gods have given man no constant gift, but the power and > liberty to act greatly. How many wait for health and warm weather to be > heroic and noble!

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the process of becoming a monk or nun is intentionally slow, as the monastic vows taken are considered to entail a lifelong commitment to God, and are not to be entered into lightly. After a person completes the novitiate, three degrees or steps must be completed in the process of preparation before one may gain the monastic habit. Orthodox monasticism Unlike in Western Christianity, where different religious orders and societies arose, each with its own profession rites, the Eastern Orthodox Church has only one type of monasticism. The profession of monastics is known as tonsure (referring to the ritual cutting of the monastic's hair which takes place during the service) and was, at one time, considered to be a Sacred Mystery (Sacrament). The Rite of Tonsure is printed in the Euchologion (Church Slavonic: Trebnik), as are the other Sacred Mysteries and services performed according to need, e.g., funerals, blessings, exorcisms, etc. The monastic habit is the same throughout the Eastern Church (with certain slight regional variations), and it is the same for both monks and nuns. Each successive grade is given a portion of the habit, the full habit being worn only by those in the highest grade, known for that reason as the \\"Great Schema\\", or \\"Great Habit\\". A person may enter any monastery of one's choice; but after being accepted by the abbot (or abbess) and making vows, one may not move from place to place without the blessing of one's ecclesiastical superior. This satisfies the principle of \\"stability of place\\", important to monasticism. One becomes a monk or nun by being tonsured, a rite that only a priest can perform. This is typically done by the abbot. The priest tonsuring a monk or nun must be tonsured into the same or greater degree of monasticism that he is tonsuring another into. In other words, only a hieromonk who has been tonsured into the Great Schema may himself tonsure a Schemamonk. A bishop, however, may tonsure into any rank, regardless of his own. On rare occasions, a bishop will allow a priest to tonsure a monk or nun into any rank. Eastern Orthodox monks are addressed as \\"Father\\", as are priests and deacons in the Orthodox Church. When conversing among themselves, monks in some places may address one another as \\"Brother\\". Novices are most often referred to as \\"Brother\\", although at some places, e.g., on Mount Athos, novices are addressed as \\"Father\\". Among the Greeks, old monks are often called Gheronda, or \\"Elder\\", out of respect for their dedication. In the Slavic tradition, the title of Elder (Church Slavonic: —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–µ—Ü—ä, Starets) is normally reserved for those who are of an advanced spiritual life, and who serve as guides for others. Nuns who have been tonsured to the Stavrophore or higher are addressed as \\"Mother\\". Novice and Rassophore nuns are addressed as \\"Sister\\". Nuns live ascetic lives that are identical to those of their male counterparts and are therefore also called monachai (the feminine plural of monachos). Their community is likewise called a monastery. Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called hieromonks (priest-monks); monks who have been ordained to the diaconate are called hierodeacons (deacon-monks). A Schemamonk who is a priest is called a Hieroschemamonk. Most monks are not ordained; a community will normally only present as many candidates for ordination to the bishop as the liturgical needs of the community require. Bishops are required by the sacred canons of the Orthodox Church to be chosen from among the monastic clergy, who do not marry. Today, the most important centres of Christian Orthodox monasticism are Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt), Meteora at Thessaly in Greece, Mount Athos in Greek Macedonia, Mar Saba in the Bethlehem Governorate of the West Bank, and the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian on the island of Patmos in Greece. Degrees=Novice Novice (Greek: Œ¥œåŒ∫ŒπŒºŒøœÇ, d√≥kimos; Church Slavonic: –ø–æ—Å–ª—É—à–Ω–∏–∫—ä, poslushnik), lit. \\"one under obedience\\"‚ÄîThose wishing to join a monastery begin their lives as novices. After the candidate comes to the monastery and lives as a guest for not less than three days, the abbot or abbess may bless the candidate to become a novice. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he or she simply receives permission to wear the clothing of a novice. In the Eastern monastic tradition, novices may or may not dress in the black inner cassock (; Church Slavonic: Podriasnik) and wear the soft monastic hat (Greek: Skoufos, Church Slavonic: Skufia), depending on the tradition of the local community, and in accordance with the abbot‚Äôs directives. In some communities, the novice also wears the leather belt. Monks are given a prayer rope and instructed in the use of the Jesus Prayer. If a novice chooses to leave during the period of the novitiate, no penalty is incurred. He may also be asked to leave at any time if his behaviour does not conform to the monastic life, or if the superior discerns that he is not called to monasticism. When the abbot or abbess deems the novice ready, he is asked if he wishes to join the monastery. Some, out of humility, will choose to remain novices all their lives. Every stage of the monastic life must be entered into voluntarily. Rasophore Rasophore (Greek: ·ø•Œ±œÉŒøœÜœåœÅŒøœÇ, rasophoros; Church Slavonic: —Ä—è—Å–æ—Ñ–æ—Ä—ä, ryasofor), lit. \\"Robe-bearer\\"‚ÄîIf the novice continues to become a monk, he is clothed in the first degree of monasticism at a service at which he receives the tonsure. Although there are no formal vows made at this point, the candidate is normally required to affirm his commitment to persevere in the monastic life. The abbot performs the tonsure, cutting a small amount of hair from four spots on the head, forming a cross. The novice is given the outer cassock (Greek: œÅŒ¨œÉŒøŒΩ, Rasson, Exorasson, or Mandorrason; Church Slavonic: —Ä—è—Å—Å–∞, Riassa), an outer robe with wide sleeves, from which the name of Rassophore is derived. He is also given a kalimavkion, a cylindrical brimless hat, which is covered with a veil called an epanokalimavkion. (These are separate items in the Greek tradition. In the Russian tradition the two are stitched together and collectively called a klobuk.) If the novice has not previously received it, a leather belt is fastened around his waist. His habit is usually black, signifying that he is now dead to the world, and he receives a new name. Although the Rassophore does not make formal vows, he is morally obligated to continue in the monastic estate for the rest of his life. Some will remain Rassophores permanently without going on to the higher degrees. Stavrophore Stavrophore (Greek: œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅoœÜœåœÅŒøœÇ, stavrophoros; Church Slavonic: –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–Ω–æ—Å–µ—Ü—ä, krestonosets), lit. \\"Cross-bearer\\"‚ÄîThe next level for Eastern monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure, when the abbot feels the monk has reached an appropriate level of discipline, dedication, and humility. This degree is also known as the Little Schema, and is thought of as a \\"betrothal\\" to the Great Schema. At this stage, the monk makes formal vows of stability of place, chastity, obedience and poverty. Then he is tonsured and clothed in the habit, which in addition to that worn by the Rassophore, includes the paramandyas (Greek: œÄŒ±œÅŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÖŒ±œÇ; Church Slavonic: –ø–∞—Ä–∞–º–∞–Ω—ä, paraman), a piece of square cloth worn on the back, embroidered with the instruments of the Passion, and connected by ties to a wooden cross worn over the heart. The paramandyas represents the yoke of Christ. Because of this addition, he is now called Stavrophore, or Cross-bearer. He is also given a wooden hand cross (or \\"profession cross\\"), which he should keep in his icon corner, and a beeswax candle, symbolic of monastic vigilance and sacrificing himself for God. At his death, the monk will be buried holding the cross, and the candle will be burned at his funeral. In the Slavic practice, the Stavrophore also wears the monastic mantle, which symbolizes the 40 days of the Lord's fasting on the Mountain of Temptation. The rasson worn by the Stavrophore is more ample than that worn by the Rassophore. After the ceremony, the newly tonsured Stavrophore will remain in vigil in the church for five days, refraining from all work, except spiritual reading. In the early 21st century, this vigil is often reduced to three days. The abbot increases the Stavrophore monk‚Äôs prayer rule, allows a more strict, personal ascetic practice, and gives the monk more responsibility. Great Schema The Great Schema worn by Orthodox monks and nuns of the most advanced degree Great Schema (, megaloschemos; Church Slavonic: –°—Ö–∏–º–∞, Schima)‚ÄîMonks whose abbots feel they have reached a high level of spiritual excellence reach the final stage, called the Great Schema. The tonsure of a Schemamonk or Schemanun follows the same format as the Stavrophore, and he makes the same vows and is tonsured in the same manner. But in addition to all the garments worn by the Stavrophore, he is given the analavos (Church Slavonic: analav), which is the article of monastic vesture emblematic of the Great Schema. The analavos itself is sometimes called the \\"Great Schema\\". It drapes over the shoulders and hangs down in front and in back, with the front portion somewhat longer, and is embroidered with the instruments of the Passion and the Trisagion. The Greek form does not have a hood, but the Slavic form has a hood and lappets on the shoulders, so that the garment forms a large cross covering the monk's shoulders, chest, and back. Another piece added is the Polystavrion (Œ†ŒøŒªœÖœÉœÑŒ±œçœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, \\"Many Crosses\\"), which consists of a cord with a number of small crosses plaited into it. The polystavrion forms a yoke around the monk and serves to hold the analavos in place. It also reminds the monastic that he is bound to Christ and that his arms are no longer fit for worldly activities, but that he must labor only for the Kingdom of Heaven. Among the Greeks, the mantle is added at this stage. The paramandyas of the Megaloschemos is larger than that of the Stavrophore. If the monk wears the klobuk, it is of a distinctive thimble shape, called a koukoulion, the veil of which is usually embroidered with crosses. The Schemamonk shall remain some days in vigil in the church. On the eighth day after Tonsure, there is a special service for the \\"Removal of the Koukoulion\\". In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is never given, or is given to monks and nuns only on their death bed. In others, for instance, the cenobitic monasteries on Mount Athos, it is common to tonsure a monastic into the Great Schema 3 years after the candidate commences the monastic life. In Russian and some other traditions, when a bearer of some monastic title acquires the Great Schema, his title incorporates the word \\"schema\\". For example, a hieromonk of Great Schema is called hieroschemamonk, archimandrite becomes schema-archimandrite, hegumen - schema-hegumen, etc. In the Russian Orthodox tradition, in such cases the part \\"schema\\" is commonly truncated to \\"—Å—Ö–∏\\" (sche), and correspondingly the titles are spelt as —Å—Ö–∏–º–æ–Ω–∞—Ö (schemonach), –∏–µ—Ä–æ—Å—Ö–∏–º–æ–Ω–∞—Ö (ieroschemonach), —Å—Ö–∏–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–º–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∏—Ç (schearchimandrit), and —Å—Ö–∏–∏–≥—É–º–µ–Ω (scheigumen). Coptic Orthodox monastic degrees In the Coptic Church, there are only two degrees of professed monks. These correspond to the Rassaphore combined with the Stavrophore, and the Great Schema (nothing equivalent to separate Stavrophore status in the Coptic tradition). The two rites of Rasaphore and Stavrophore are served one immediately following the other, as a single service. In the 21st century, they are usually not separated by several years between attainment of these degrees. When the two rites are separated, the portions of the habit that were given in the previous rite are not given a second time in the latter rite. The Great Schema is made of a leather cord twisted in design and has five to seven small crosses along its length. It is worn crosswise around the neck, flowing down cross wise front and back. It is usually granted to bishops either upon their episcopal consecration or shortly afterwards. It is also usually granted to a monk who has reached a high degree of asceticism or has been living as a hermit. It may also be granted to the monks, hieromonks, and abbots who have been in the monastic life for more than 30 years, and have been living exemplary monastic lives.

He was a professor at the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo from 1963 to 1971 and at the Department of Sociology from 1971 to 1988. He co- founded the Norwegian Institute for Social Research already in 1950, and has been labelled the \\"father of Norwegian sociology\\". In his early life he was a member of the anti-Nazi resistance group XU, and while later involved on the radical wing of the Labour Party, he edited the newspaper Orientering. Early career Vilhelm Aubert was born in Kristiania in 1922. He was the older brother of mathematician Karl Egil Aubert, born 1924. Vilhelm Aubert enrolled at the University of Oslo in 1940, the same year as Norway was invaded by Germany as a part of the Second World War. Aubert became a member of the illegal intelligence organization XU. Aubert finally graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1946. He then lived in the United States for two years, studying sociology and psychology at Columbia and Berkeley. After returning to Norway, he was instrumental in the foundation and consolidation of social science research in Norway, a still fledgling field. He was a joint founder of the Norwegian Institute for Social Research (ISF, or Institutt for samfunnsforsking), an independent research institute in Oslo, along with Arne N√¶ss, Eirik Rinde, and Stein Rokkan in 1950. Aubert was a member of the Labour Party in his younger days. Situated on its left wing, he co-published the pamphlet Tenk en gang til. Tanker om fred og nedrustning in 1952, and was among the founders of the newspaper Orientering. He was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper for some time. The persons in and around this newspaper were excluded from the Labour Party in 1960, following a turbulent existence as an internal party opposition, especially in foreign policy issues. Some of the excluded members went on to found the Socialist People's Party, whereas Aubert left partisan politics to concentrate on an academic career. However, he continued his opposition towards nuclear arms. Later career He took the doctor's degree in 1954, with the thesis Straffens sosiale funksjon (The Social Function of Punishment), which was also selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009‚Äì2011. In it, he discussed the preventive nature of laws and punishment. In the same year he was hired as a lecturer at the University of Oslo. He was promoted to professor of the sociology of law in 1963. This institution was, and still is, a part of the Faculty of Law. Books in the field of sociology of law include Likhet og rett (1963), Rettssosiologi (1968) and Rettens sosiale funksjon (1976). Continuity and Development in Law and Society was published posthumously in 1989. He later moved to the Department of Sociology at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Blindern, as a professorship in general sociology was established in 1971. His textbook Sosiologi, published in 1964, was the authoritative introduction to sociology in Norway for many years. His book The Hidden Society from 1965 was inspired by symbolic interactionism and the Chicago school. Death and legacy Aubert died in July 1988 during a hiking trip. He held an honorary degree at the Faculty of Law of the University of Edinburgh, issued in 1971. He has been credited for his contributions to the sociology of law, and some have labelled him the \\"father of Norwegian sociology\\" in general. Later researchers have noted his tendency to stress the importance of norms. He has been criticized for maintaining a thin line between research and activism in some of his works. Aubert's employment of action research has been attributed to his left- wing political stance.

Life  Born on 24 September 1895 in Imola, in the then province of Bologna, Della Volpe served in the First World War and afterwards completed his studies at the University of Bologna. Della Volpe taught history and philosophy in a liceo in Ravenna and at the University of Bologna from 1925 to 1938, when he became chair of history and philosophy at the University of Messina, a post he held until his retirement in 1965.Nicola Vulpe, \\"della Volpe, Galvano\\"', in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Literary Theory. Irena Rima Makarek, ed., Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1993, pp. 291-293. Della Volpe died on 13 July 1968 in Rome.  Work  Initially an idealist philosopher in the tradition of Giovanni Gentile, by the early 1940s and after an engagement with empiricist philosophy he turned strongly against idealism. In Italy, Della Volpe's work was seen by many as a scientific alternative to the Gramscian Marxism which the Communist Party of Italy (among others) had claimed as its guide. He was critical of Gramsci in part because the latter's work was rooted philosophically in the thought of Gentile and Benedetto Croce. Della Volpe was also noted for his writings on aesthetics including writings on film theory. He was an atheist. One key aspect of Della Volpe's mature thought was his attempt to develop a strictly materialist theory of aesthetics as he emphasised the role of structural characteristics and the social process of production of works of art in the formation of aesthetic judgment in opposition to Croce's doctrine of intuition which he considered a continuation of the romantic and mystical tradition of the 19th century. He developed the concept of taste as the primary source of aesthetic judgment itself. Della Volpe also wrote on issues of political philosophy, particularly the relations between the thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Karl Marx. This allowed him to explore the relations between what he called the two freedoms of Enlightenment thought, namely the civic liberties of John Locke and Immanuel Kant which became embodied in bourgeois democracy and the egalitarian freedoms described in Rousseau‚Äôs Social Contract and the Discourse on Inequality. What particularly interested Della Volpe was the contrast of the formal equality of Kantian legal freedoms, indifferent to substantive social inequality between persons, with the proportional inequality of Rousseau's social contract as an egalitarian mediation between persons. He saw Rousseau's thought on these issues as being the precursor of Marx‚Äôs famous attacks on bourgeois law in the Critique of the Gotha Programme and other writings.

Son of Robert who played for Shelbourne he was educated at Scoil Mhuir in Marino and Ard-Scoil R√≠s where he played Gaelic football and made it onto the minor Dublin county team. But soccer was O'Neill's first love and he signed for Shamrock Rovers youth team where his brother Alan was the first choice goalkeeper. He also won 5 caps for the Irish youth team around this time. He then moved to Jim McLaughlin's Dundalk team where he struggled to break into the first team but at Reserve level won 2 Reserve league titles. Those performances attracted Billy Young and O'Neill was soon on his way to Bohemians where he made his League of Ireland debut, alongside Paul Doolin at Sligo on 13 September 1981, keeping a clean sheet. He would stay at \\"Dalyer\\" for the rest of the decade, missing only 1 league game between 1981 and 1988. He was to make 6 appearances in European competition for Bohs against the likes of Rangers, Dundee United and Aberdeen. He had near misses while at Dalymount Park but never managed to pick up a winners medal ‚Äì winning numerous League runners-up medals and 2 FAI Cup runners up medal (1982 and 1983). Dermot earned one cap for the Republic of Ireland U21 at Fratton Park in March 1985. After 283 league appearances and 10 seasons at Bohs, O'Neill signed for Derry City under new manager Roy Coyle. O'Neill seemed destined to remain trophyless throughout his career when Derry lost the 1994 FAI Cup Final to Sligo Rovers and then lost the league on the last day of the 1994/95 season when Dundalk pipped Derry to the title. But one week after that league disaster, O'Neill finally got his winners medal as Derry beat Shelbourne to win the 1995 FAI Cup. It marked the end of his career at Derry as he moved on to the Irish League with Glenavon. He played in the 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Cup and won the Irish Cup in 1997 beating Cliftonville in the final. A mixed season for Glenavon followed and Dermot moved on to Ballymena United under Nigel Best. He only spent one season there and after just avoiding relegation, O'Neill retired. O'Neill got back into football in 2001 when he became goalkeeping coach at Longford Town under Stephen Kenny. When Kenny moved on to Bohemians, O'Neill returned to his footballing home and stayed there as goalkeeping coach until the summer of 2006 when under pressure boss Gareth Farrelly decided he was surplus to requirements. However, when Pat Fenlon was appointed manager of Bohs, he brought back O'Neill as goalkeeping coach for the 2008 season.

The Ursuline Order remained in the monastery until 1951, when it was suppressed and converted to secular use under the Communist regime. It has been since used by the Regional Museum of Olomouc. Historical aspects The history of the two Orders of nuns who inhabited the monastery was influenced by many important personalities from both sacred and secular circles. The beginnings of the monastery are connected with the patronage of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, members of the royal family and noble families, the pope and the Bishop of Olomouc. Establishment The monastery was established in the Polish province and is among the oldest monasteries of Dominican nuns in Bohemia and Moravia. It was constructed for the nuns in the second half of the 13th century. First reports of its existence are from the year 1287, when Vojslava of Debl√≠n gave the patronage rights of the church in V√°≈æany to the monastery. It was built in an undeveloped area at foot of the Michalsk√Ω Hill at the southern tip of the city, between the city wall and blocks of houses near the marketplace on the present-day Lower Square. Monastery buildings Gothic portal of the Church of St. Catherine in Olomouc The architectural, artistic, and historical aspects of the monastery buildings have been assessed by a number of researchers, but a scientific assessment of the convent complex has not yet been performed. There are not many research findings about its architectural history, but on the basis of the combination of pictorial and written sources, and materials from the preserved structure, it is possible to reconstruct the architectural development of the monastery. The inconspicuous monastery complex is now enclosed by blocks of houses in the southern part of the historic city centre and the monastery is one of the most important historic landmarks in Olomouc. The building is representative of various architectural styles and in the centre of the monastery is one of the oldest and most extraordinary Gothic buildings in Olomouc ‚Äì the Monastery Church of St. Catherine of Alexandria. Other parts of the monastery date back to the Middle Ages and Renaissance, which were built over during a reconstruction in the Baroque style. The monastery was significantly structurally modified for the last time in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Development It is supposed that the buildings of the complex developed gradually according to the needs of the monastic community and its financial resources . During the first decades of its existence, the Dominican nuns enjoyed a good economic situation. The high point of the monastery's history was in the 14th century. Although the majority of the monasteries of Dominican nuns disappeared after the Hussite Wars, the Dominican nuns in Olomouc survived without further calamities until the community was suppressed in 1782, under the reforms of Emperor Joseph II. It was claimed at the time that the monastery, among others, was disbanded because the nuns failed to care for the sick and promote education.Regional Museum website During this period, its Baroque buildings were constructed. Damage by fire In the course of time, the monastery was damaged by several great fires, as well as the conflicts of the Thirty Years War and a major fire in the city in 1709. The monastery was again reconstructed in the middle of the 18th century. After the Dominican community was disbanded, the buildings were made available for the use of the Ursulines. They had the building remodeled for their own needs, adding some buildings, particularly for classrooms and housing for their students. These structural transformations of the complex were finished before the middle of the 19th century by the church interior alterations. In 1905 a new school building was constructed in the south part of the old monastery complex. Occupancy by the Ursulines ended in 1951, under the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic when nearly all religious institutions in the country were closed. Current status At present, the monastery is being used for secular purposes. Its buildings form a complex of structures around four courts with a garden at the western wall. It is not a unified scheme of buildings and courts. As the monastery's composition was developed by the build-up and spread of the buildings, it developed asymmetrically. The most well-preserved building is the monastery church, in which the Gothic Architecture was preserved with many original details, especially the portals and vaults of the long presbytery. It has preserved the original segmentation of the interior by the window cornice, truncated support column with capitals, and windows with tracery. Well-preserved fragments of artistic and hand-done decoration remain on the walls of the monastery. Surveys have discovered previously unknown architectural details of the oldest structure. From the older interior decorating of the monastery, only fragments of the church interior, several Baroque sculptures and pictures of saints, Neo-Gothic furniture, and altar pieces have been preserved. The monastery complex is currently mostly unused while it awaits reconstruction and preservation.

The other former Clavibacter species have been reclassified to genera Leifsonia, Rathayibacter, and Curtobacterium. Clavibacter michiganensis has nine subspecies; all are available from Fera Science for legitimate researchers. Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus are the main diseases that cause substantial economic losses worldwide by damaging tomatoes and potatoes.Gartemann et al. \\"Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis: first steps in the understanding of virulence of a Gram-positive phytopathogenic bacterium\\", Journal of Biotechnology, Germany, 16 July 2003. Retrieved on 2011-10-26.  Context  Clavibacter, also known as Ring Rot, is an unusual genus of phytopathogenic bacteria in that it is gram-positive and does not have a type three secretion system. All Clavibacter species and subspecies have a type B2Œ≥ cell wall crosslinked at a diaminobutyrate residue. Clavibacter is an aerobic bacterium with a coryneform morphology. There is no mycelium and no spores are produced. Clavibacter michiganensis infects the primary host in one of three ways: wounds, hydathodes, or by contaminated seed. If the bacteria reach a suitable quorum, the result is a systemic vascular infection. In the first stages of invasion, C. michiganensis resides as a biotrophic pathogen in the xylem vessels. Clavibacter has a complex history of taxonomical names. For a long time, there was only one recognized species within the genus Clavibacter. There are nine subspecies within the michiganensis species. Recently, some strains have been reclassified into other genera. This complex history stems from the difficulty in characterizing bacteria. Unlike fungi, the morpholology of bacteria is not very sufficient for taxonomical purposes. To this end, strains of a phytopathogenic bacteria, called pathovars, are distinguished by cultural (selective media), physiological, biochemical (e.g. secreted enzymes the chemical responses of the plant), or pathological characteristics (including the range of susceptible hosts).Eichenlaub R, Gartemann K-H, Burger A. 2006 Clavibacter michiganensis, a group of Gram positive phytopathogenic bacteria.

Dordrecht: Springer Recently, two strains of this bacteria ‚Äì subsp. sepidonicum and subsp. michiganensis ‚Äì have had their genomes sequenced and annotated. There is still much to discover about this pathogen-host interaction but now that the genome has been sequenced, the rate of discoveries will likely increase. One of the main goals pertaining to research of these bacterial genomes is to develop resistant varieties. Unfortunately, no resistant varieties have yet been found.Coaker GL, Willard B, Kinter M, Stockinger EJ, Francis DM. 2004.

It causes a disease in potatoes known as 'ring rot' due to the way it rots vascular tissue inside potato tubersManzer F, Genereux H.1981.Ring Rot. In Compendium of Potato Disease, ed. WJ Hobson, pp. 31‚Äì32.St Paul, MN:Am Phytopathol.Soc.Press It is present in parts of Europe but is under statutory control under ‚ÄòCouncil Directive 93/85/EEC' of 4 October 1993 on the control of potato ring rot. This means that if an outbreak occurs, the outbreak must be controlled and if possible the disease has to be eradicated. If necessary, prohibitions are put into place to prevent further spread. A plant showing symptoms of ring rot should be reported to the local plant health authority. Hosts and symptoms The subsp. sepidonicus is an economically important pathogen because it affects only potato, which was the 12th highest ranking commodity in 2009, generating $44,128,413,000 globally.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. http://faostat.fao.org/site/339/default.aspx Like all bacteria in the genus Clavibacter michiganesis subsp. sepidonicus causes a systemic vascular infection by invading the xylem vessels and multiplying there which sometimes leads to plugged xylem vessels. When diagnosing a subsp. sepidonicus infection in potato, look for discoloration of the vascular ring within the tuber that has been described as \\"glassy\\" or \\"water-soaked\\" with the ooze inside having a \\"cheese-like consistency\\".Evtushenko LI, Takeuchi M. 2006. The family Microbacteriaceae. In \\"The Prokaryotes\\", 3rd edition, ed. M Dworkin, S Falkow, E Rosenburg, KH Schleifer, E Stackenbrandt, 3:1020‚Äì99. New York: Springer Symptoms of potato 'ring rot' are yellowing of the leaf margins which later turn brown and look like they are burned. Tubers rot from the inside, sometimes progressing to leave hollow shells. Rotting of the tubers is the more common symptom. Infected land cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years. Among others, United States, Canada, many EU states and Middle Eastern countries have not yet been able to eradicate this pathogen. Disease cycle The causal agent of Ring Rot of Potato overwinters many different ways. The bacteria survives in infected tubers in both storage and in the field. Diseased tubers then infect newly planted tubers. The bacterium also may be foundas dried slime on machinery or containers. For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts have a high risk of becoming infected. The bacteria enters the host through wounds and invades the xylem where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels. In advanced stages of infection, the bacteria will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels. The bacteria may also invade the roots and cause them to deteriorate.Agrios, George N (2005). Plant Pathology, Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press. . C. sepidonicus spreads by contaminated soil, surfaces, infected seed, wash waters, infected potato waste, etc. It can survive on warehouse walls, boxes, bags etc. On machinery in dry conditions, it can survive at least a month ‚Äì sometimes in the form of dried bacterial ooze. It is also able to overwinter in soil in association with plant debris. C. sepidonicus will only survive in the soil as long as the host tissue in which it resides persists and resists decomposition by saprophytic microorganisms in the soil. This poor ability to compete as a saprophyte in the absence of a susceptible host makes Clavibacter sp. known as soil invaders as opposed to soil inhabitants. Environment North, Northwest and Central Europe have favorable climates for virulence. The disease multiplies rapidly and survives longer in cooler environments around 21 ¬∞C. At favorable conditions, the pathogen can survive 63 months in infected potato stems and 18 months in burlap sacks., CABI and EPPO for the EU. \\"Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus\\", EPPO quarantine pest.

Retrieved on 2011-10-26. Hosts and symptoms When the infection occurs in an early stage of the tomato plant there may be wilting on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The wilting may only show on one side of the leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 109 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then there is severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly. If infection occurs at a late stage of plant development, plants are able to survive and generate fruits. However, the plant may appear stressed rather than wilted and may develop white interveinal areas that will develop into brown necrotic tissue. Often the seeds are infected as well. Superficial infections increase the risk of epidemics. They occur when the bacteria multiply on the epidermis of the host, enter through stomata, or enter through a very shallow wound that does not allow the pathogen to reach the xylem tissue. The host may look like it was rubbed with cornmeal or coarse flour but it is actually a series of blisters that me be raised or sunken and appear white to pale orange. The most common leaf symptom is a dark brown spot surrounded by a sort of orange-like area on the edge of the leaf. Fruits may develop \\"bird's eye\\" spotting, which are pale green to white raised pustules that have a brown center and chlorotic halo. Pictures of these symptoms are available at the cited reference. However, latent infections are common. The Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis wild type strain NCPPB382 carries two plasmids associated with virulence: pCM1 and pCM2. The avirulent strain, CMM100, does not contain these plasmids. Strains that carried one of the two plasmids were found to be virulent but wilting symptoms were delayed. The virulent and avirulent strains produced the same amount of exopolysaccharides, suggesting that EPS does not play a significant role in pathogenicity.Meletzus D, Bermpohl A, Drier J, Eichenlaub R. 1993.

Phytopathol.119:142-46 The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and suckering or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex. Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3‚Äì6 weeks and the risk of secondary infection goes up with water-splashing. The common occurrence of latent infections ‚Äì presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms ‚Äì makes this pathogen especially dangerous.Gitaitis RD, Beaver RW, Voloudakis AE.1991. Detection of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis in symptomless tomato transplants. Plant Dis.75:834-38 However, the assumption that C. michiganensis does not overwinter in the soil is not without controversy. The genome of C. michiganesis has recently been sequenced and new theories will surely arise once more work has been completed. What is known is that Cmm can use hydrolysis products as carbon and energy sources by means of a number of ATP-binding cassette transporters and Œ±- and Œ≤-glucosidases. This suggests that Cmm can survive in the soil as long as there is decaying host material present. It has also been determined that the genome of subsp. michiganensis does not have genes that encode for nitrate and nitrate reductases. This means that the bacteria depends on previously reduced nitrogen compounds or amino acids for its nitrogen source.Gartemann KH, Abt B, Bekel T, Burger A, Engemann J, et al. 2008. The genome sequence of the tomato- pathogenic actinomycete Clavibacter michiganensissubsp michiganensis NCPPB382 reveals a large island involved in pathogenicity. J.Bacteriol.190:2138-49 Also lacking in the Cmm genome are genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction, which is associated with an auxotrophy for methionine ‚Äì one of two amino acids that contain sulphur. Cmm has a pathogenicity island (PI) that is encoded in the chromosome and is probably associated with colonization and plant defense evasion or suppression. This island has been subdivided into two subregions: chp and tomA. Serine proteases of the families S1A, Ppa, and PpA-E are encoded in the chp subregion as well as subtilase SbtA. Environment Warm temperature in the range of 23‚Äì28¬∞ Celsius and the high relative humidity (>80%) are optimal environments for Clavibacter michiganesis subsp. michiganesis, a tomato bacterial canker symptom development.Xu et al. \\"Colonization of Tomato Seedlings by Bioluminescent Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganesis under Different Humidity Regimes\\", Phytopathology, Ohio.

In humid or wet weather, slimy masses of bacteria ooze through the cracks to the surface of the stem, from which they are spread to leaves and fruits and cause secondary infections Infected host plants will show severe symptoms on hot days when there is a high transpiration rate since the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels. Management The best way to control a disease is an use of healthy seeds that have already been acid extracted.

The play is set in 1926 and is described as a comedy in 14 Scenes. Flei√üer based the play on real incidents, and worked on it in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht. The play was revised and produced at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin in March and April 1929, directed by Brecht and Jacob Geis, with set-design by Caspar Neher. In 1968 Flei√üer began a third revision, which was performed in 1970. In 1971, Rainer Werner Fassbinder adapted the play as a film for television. The setting of the play is Ingolstadt, a provincial city in Bavaria. The play depicts the immorality and selfishness which can be found in small towns, as well as how the militia can disrupt the lives of civilians. As a result of its depiction of a sexist society, the play did not win much sympathy from her fellow inhabitants of Ingolstadt and Fleisser suffered massive unpopularity in her home town after it was published and produced. Characters Berta, the protagonist. She becomes romantically attached to Korl, a soldier who is placed in Ingolstadt to help mend a bridge. She works as a servant for Unertl, the father of Fabian. Alma, a friend of Berta. She used to work as a servant. Unlike Berta, Alma is a pragmatist. She sternly believes in individuality and living of means, with no reliance upon the male sex. Korl, a soldier. Korl enjoys the physical aspects of life. On first meeting Berta he assumes that she wants the same from their meeting (sex) and has little patience with her attitude. He informs her that he is a bad person, that he can be cruel and will hurt her if she is good to him. Fabian, son of Unertl. He is romantically interested in Berta but does not know how to proceed. He asks a friend, Zeck for advice and is told that men should be cold in love (\\"In der Liebe mu√ü ein Mann kalt sein\\"). While he shows genuine concern for her feelings, and defends her against the complaints of his father he also falls into treating her as an animal or possession when in male company, in an attempt to show off. Unertl, a businessman, Fabian's father and Berta's employer. Misogynistic and crude, Unertl is an unsympathetic character embodying the idea that serving girls ought to have no idea in their heads that do not relate to their employ. Motifs The motif of the bridge is ironic. The military come into the town in order to mend the bridge for the benefit of the townsfolk. The council send wood for the militia to use. Some of the townsfolk steal wood from the bridge in order to mend the diving board for their pool, showing their narrow and selfish views, talking themselves into stealing wood which would ultimately benefit the whole society. Thus the bridge which could unite the soldiers and the townsfolk, in fact disunites them further.

The call letters stood for \\"World's Most Unusual University,\\" an early promotional slogan of BJU. Bob Jones, Sr., the founder of BJU, intended the station to operate independently by accepting advertising rather than being supported by the university, but he did not expect the station to make a profit. The AM station eventually increased its power from 1,000 to 5,000 watts. An FM station was added on August 15, 1960; and in 1965, it became the second stereo station in South Carolina. In 1963, WMUU-FM became the most powerful station in South Carolina, radiating 100,000 watts and increasing its listening radius from fifty to a hundred miles. Bob Jones University also bought WAVO in Atlanta but later sold it in order to focus its efforts on the Greenville station. In 1973, the WMUU building on the BJU campus was demolished to build Founder's Memorial Amphitorium, completed in 1973. For several years, the studios were located in the FM transmitter building on Paris Mountain. WMUU AM & FM eventually moved to 920 Wade Hampton Boulevard, and BJU transferred ownership of the station to the Gospel Fellowship Association, its missionary arm, headquartered in the same building. WMUU became an independent corporation, although it maintained a close relationship with BJU, and most of its employees were graduates. Many faculty members in the university's Fine Arts division participated in the station's early operation. For the first year, Bob Pratt served as a temporary manager. He was succeeded by James Ryerson who was station manager for nearly three decades.

The trade fair, which can be visited by anyone, is held every three years on the grounds of the Neue Messe M√ºnchen and lasts for seven days. Its organizer is Messe M√ºnchen. History The first exhibition took place in 1954 as part of the ‚ÄúBaumusterschau‚Äù at Theresienh√∂he in Munich and was then known as the spring show for construction machinery. 58 exhibitors presented their products on a total gross area of 20,000 m¬≤, attracting around 8,000 visitors. Two years later, the exhibition space had already doubled and the name ‚Äúbauma‚Äù, which is still used today, was introduced. In the early days, the fair was a purely German exhibition. In 1958, the first exhibitors from abroad (number: 13) took part in bauma. Due to the building boom the exhibition space quickly became too small and the fair was relocated for the first time. In 1962, bauma opened its doors on a former airport site in Oberwiesenfeld, offering 100,000 m¬≤ more space for‚Äîin the meantime‚Äîmore than 450 exhibitors. But the days of the new location were already numbered: the Olympic Park was created on this site as the 1972 Olympic Games had been awarded to Munich. In 1967, the annual bauma therefore returned to Theresienh√∂he, where it remained for decades. In 1967, bauma was transferred from private ownership to Messe M√ºnchen's portfolio, and in 1969, the first bauma was organized under the leadership of Messe M√ºnchen. Although successful right from the start, bauma then experienced an incomparable upswing: the award of the Olympic Games turned Munich into the largest construction site in Europe and brought the construction industry an unprecedented order situation. In 1998, the trade fair company moved from Theresienh√∂he to Munich-Riem. Since then, bauma has also taken place there. In 2002, bauma CHINA was launched as first foreign trade fair within the bauma network. In the meantime, bauma CHINA has become the largest capital goods fair in Asia and the second largest construction machinery fair in the world. And meanwhile there is a whole network of bauma trade fairs, including bauma CONEXPO INDIA, bauma CONEXPO AFRICA, bauma CTT RUSSIA and M&T; EXPO. Key figures In terms of exhibition space, Bauma is both the largest trade fair in the industry and the biggest trade show in the world. The past Bauma edition that took place from April 11 to 17, 2016 attracted 3,425 exhibitors from 58 countries (2013: 3,421 exhibitors; 2010: 3,256 exhibitors) and 583,736 visitors from 219 countries (2013: around 535,065; 2010: around 420,170). The exhibition space was 605,000 m¬≤ (2013: 575,000 m¬≤; 2010: 555,000 m¬≤). Exhibitors Both German and foreign suppliers of machinery and vehicles for construction and mining exhibit at the fair. The trade fair basically comprises four sectors. The \\"All around construction sites\\" sector includes suppliers of construction vehicles, construction machinery, construction tools, lifting appliances, formwork and scaffoldings. The exhibition sector \\"Mining, extraction and processing of raw materials\\" pools manufacturers of machines for the extraction of raw materials and mining as well as of mineral processing technology. The \\"Production of building materials\\" sector comprises machines and plants for producing concrete, asphalt, clay and similar building materials. Drive technology, testing, measurement and control technology as well as accessories including services are presented in the \\"Components and service suppliers\\" sector.

Biography Aleksandr was born in the family of sexton Mikhail Fyodorovich Grenkov and Marfa Nikolayevna Grenkova. He was the sixth of eight children. At the age of 12 Aleksandr entered the Tambov clerical school and later the Tambov theological seminary. In 1835, shortly before the graduation, Aleksandr became severely ill and made a vow if he got well to become a monk. He recovered but delayed his decision and became a private teacher in a family of a landlord and later in the Lipetsk clerical school. During summer vacation, Aleksandr met a well-known elder Hilarion from the village of Troekurovo. The Elder advised: \\"Go to Optina and you will be experienced. You could go to Sarov too, but there are no more experienced elders there\\" (at that time, St. Seraphim of Sarov already reposed). And the Elder added: \\"They need you there\\". After this advice, in 1839, Aleksandr entered the Optina Monastery in Kaluga guberniya when the monastery was in its spiritual heyday. His first guide was Starets (Elder) Leonid and then later Starets Makary, whom Ambrose shared a cell with. This gave him get help in his spiritual progress. Ambrose had a very lively humor and sociable character which conflicted with his more stoic spiritual discipline. Ambrose had many struggles with illness throughout his life building upon these struggles for insight into the human condition. Ambrose was tonsured as a monk, after only three years, in 1842. He was given the religious name Ambrose in honour of Saint Ambrose of Milan. In another three years Ambrose advanced and was ordained a hieromonk (priest). On the trip to Kaluga for ordination, Ambrose caught cold. Since then, his health became so poor that he almost could not serve as a priest. Portrait of Saint Ambrose of Optina Due to illness Ambrose was forced into semi-reclusion for several years. This seclusion allowed him to concentrate on the mastering of the Jesus Prayer or hesychasm and to experience the meaning of hesychia, the silence of the soul before God or theoria. Even though of a weak constitution Father Ambrose continued work assisting Elder Makary with the translation of the Holy Fathers, in particular, with the translation of The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Father Ambrose maintained his correspondence and counsel to pilgrims, and later as a staretz (Elder) out of love for all people he counseled and any who sought him. When Elder Macarius died in September, 1860, Father Ambrose replaced him as the principal elder of the monastery. Elder Ambrose remained the principal staretz of Optina for 30 years. Ambrose was visited by countless people, and his love for every person was so strong that he would even see people when he had passed the point of exhaustion being forced to lay down. Even then he would not refuse to listen to people coming to him to seek his counsel. The staretz had the gift of being able to see into people's souls where no secret was hidden from him. There is abundant testimony to his clairvoyance and gift of healing which he tried to conceal.Sayings of St Ambrose of Optina Known for his deep kindness and compassion, no one's question or counsel was refused. Being able to give wise advice to other people, Elder Ambrose, due to his humility, sought advice from others without relying on his own mind even having the gift of reasoning. After the death of Elder Macarius, having no one to turn to in his monastery, he turned first to his bishop Gregory. And over time, learning from some credible people about one hidden, wandering spiritual elder, elder Ambrose immediately tried to get close to him. He constantly wrote secret letters to this elder with the intention to do everything with the advice of another person in which he saw the expression of the will of God ‚Äì not following own will.Living of Saint Ambrose of Optina. Archimandrite Agapitus. 2012 (Reprint of 1900 edition). Saint Ambrose founded Shamordino Convent in 1884. This convent, which is near Optina, opened its doors to women who were poor, sickly, or even blind. Most convents were very poor and had to rely on the incomes of women who had a certain personal wealth in order to remain open. Saint Ambrose made it possible for any woman who wished to become a nun. After the death of the first abbess, Mother Sophia, Father Ambrose went there in June 1890 to put the convent's affairs in order. He was unable to return to Optina due to illness, and died in the Shamordino cloister on October 10, 1891, and was buried in the Optina \\"desert\\" (poustin). His relics were placed in the Vvedensky Church of the Monastery. Cultural allusions Shamordino Convent was founded by St. Ambrose Dostoevsky stated that in Elder Ambrose he had found a living example of the Christian ideal. Elder Nektary of The Brothers Karamazov referred to Ambrose as \\"an earthly angel and a heavenly man.\\" Saint Ambrose is supposed to have been seen surrounded by the uncreated light more than once. In the Russian Orthodox tradition, this is the definitive sign of transfiguration and citizenship in the Kingdom of Heaven to come, or paradise, similar to what has been attributed to Saint Seraphim of Sarov. Ambrose was also a subject in Velikoe v malom i Antikhrist by Serge Nilus.

At the age of seventeen, he emigrated to Buenos Aires, Argentina where he first began with Union activities. In his trips through some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico, he took part in several struggles related with problems in the working environment. He finished his voyage in New York City, where he established himself as a mechanic. When the Spanish Second Republic was proclaimed, he went back to Berm√©s, becoming quickly the leader of the area's working movement, a very well-developed one because of the presence of rail workers on the Ourense- Santiago line. He became a member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in 1936. A few days after the Spanish coup of July 1936, a group of members of the Spanish far-right movement of Falange tried to arrest him, but Fondevila managed to run away, although he was eventually hurt. He remained in hiding until he managed to cross the bordier to Portugal, where he boarded to France, and from there, he passed to the Spanish Republican territory. He took part in the Spanish Civil War as a Commissioner of War, in both the bloody battles of Brunete and Teruel. In 1939, he tried to leave for France, but he was arrested and confined in a concentration camp, from which he ran away and, disguised, returned to Galicia in 1942, relying on a supposed amnesty. But that did not happen, so he decided to go into exile in Mexico. In that country, he tried to be able to make a better living as a mechanic, with some attempts to introduce a \\"bomb-throw-machine\\" of his invention to the United States Army.

Plot In 1913, Sherlock Holmes, virtually in retirement, is persuaded by Inspector Alec MacDonald of Scotland Yard to take on a baffling case. Three dead bodies have been found in London's East End, all with no discernible cause of death, but the expressions on their faces suggest that they all died in a state of terror. Holmes, accompanied by Dr Watson, begins an investigation, but before he can make any real progress he is visited by the British Home Secretary and a German Diplomat, Count Udo von Felseck, who tell Holmes that a German envoy, on a secret mission to Britain, has disappeared from Felseck's house in Buckinghamshire. Unless Holmes can track him down, war between the two countries will become imminent. Holmes considers the possibility that the two matters are related and that someone is not telling him the truth. Cast *Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes *John Mills as Doctor Watson *Anne Baxter as Irene Adler *Ray Milland as Home Secretary *Anton Diffring as Count Udo von Felseck *Gordon Jackson as Inspector Alec MacDonald *Susan Penhaligon as Miss Derwent *Marcus Gilbert as Anton von Felseck *Jenny Laird as Mrs. Hudson *Russell Hunter as Alfred Coombs *James Cossins as Frederick Baines *Eric Dodson as Lord Claremont *Georgina Coombs as Lady Claremont *Dominic St Clair as Boot Boy Production=Development Executive producer Kevin Francis had previously attempted to raise funds for a new version of The Hound of the Baskervilles. Francis intended to cast Peter Cushing as Holmes, which would be Cushing's third take on the Doyle tale after the 1959 Hammer production and the two-part production for the 1968 television series, and feature a stop-motion dog created by Ray Harryhausen. While funding for the proposed film collapsed, it led to Francis discussing an original tale with writer Anthony Hinds. Casting This is Peter Cushing's final portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. He first donned Holmes' deerstalker in Hammer's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959). Later, he took over from Douglas Wilmer in the BBC television series Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in the late 1960s. Cushing considered Sherlock Holmes to be his favorite role but his age, Cushing being in his 70s, required the part to be written for a much older Holmes. Filming Filming began in the summer of 1984 at Twickenham Film Studios with location work at Buckinghamshire and London. Unfilmed sequel There were plans for a followup entitled The Abbot's Cry but the film never materialized due to Cushing's declining health.

The genus is distinguished from other genera of Lake Malawi Haplochromini by details of its melanic color pattern and by its dentition. The color pattern includes (1) a midlateral horizontal stripe starting at least an eye length behind the operculum, this stripe broken into separate spots at least on its front half, more nearly continuous on its rear half, extending to the end of the caudal peduncle; (2) a second (supralateral) stripe above the midlateral one that is only on the front part of the flanks, and which is also at least partly broken into spots; (3) above this at the base of the dorsal fin are 4 or 5 dorsal midline spots. The dentition of the jaws is also distinctive in fish at least 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length (not counting the caudal fin); the outer teeth are roughly conical with a single cusp and are spaced apart from each other by about the width of the tooth. Species There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Hemitaeniochromis brachyrhynchus M. K. Oliver, 2012Oliver, M.K.

He is a founding member of Bell X1. Since 2014, he has been performing under the moniker Join Me in the Pines. Early years From a young age, Geraghty cut his teeth in a number of bands in his home town of Leixlip. He went on to play instruments such as drums, guitar, banjo, harmonica, and piano, and to begin honing the art of recording. In 1994 he joined the group Juniper along with Paul Noonan, Damien Rice, Dominic Phillips and Brian Crosby. Damien Rice left Juniper in 1998 to pursue a solo career, and the remaining members reformed as Bell X1, named after the Bell X-1. Music career Geraghty released his debut solo album Kill Your Darlings on 7 September 2007, while still a member of Bell X1. His debut earned him a nomination for the Choice Music Prize and two Meteor award nominations (Best Album and Best Male). In November 2007, he headlined the 2FM 2moro 2our. On 28 August 2009, Geraghty released his second solo album The Victory Dance. The release of the album coincided with a nationwide tour which began with a live performance at Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Co. Laois. Both of these dark and atmospheric albums caught the attention of film directors and editors which prompted a foray into the world of screen composition. Geraghty, through Bell X1, has achieved major success in their native Ireland and in other European countries. Bell X1 toured in the United States in 2012. Bell X1's album Chop Chop was released on 28 June 2013 in Ireland, an album that sees Geraghty back behind the drum kit. The track 'Diorama' on which Geraghty sings lead vocal, was used as part of the film soundtrack to There's Always Woodstock. In 2014, Geraghty released his third solo album INHERIT, under the moniker \\"Join Me in the Pines\\". In 2018 he returned to his hometown of Leixlip to perform a song from INHERIT as part of the TV series Jingle Jangle, which was aired on Irish television in autumn 2017. Geraghty released the \\"Join Me in the Pines\\" album MONOMANIA on 30 August 2019. It was recorded in his studio \\"The Numbers Station\\" which saw his friend from school, Mick Major (Bon Ton Rouler) help out in the role of producer. This reunion of sorts has been on- going and promises more releases from Join Me in the Pines later in 2020.

Function  Doublecortin expression in the rat dentate gyrus, 21st postnatal day. Oomen et al., 2009. Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein expressed by neuronal precursor cells and immature neurons in embryonic and adult cortical structures. Neuronal precursor cells begin to express DCX while actively dividing, and their neuronal daughter cells continue to express DCX for 2‚Äì3 weeks as the cells mature into neurons. Downregulation of DCX begins after 2 weeks, and occurs at the same time that these cells begin to express NeuN, a marker for mature neurons. Due to the nearly exclusive expression of DCX in developing neurons, this protein has been used increasingly as a marker for neurogenesis. Indeed, levels of DCX expression increase in response to exercise, and that increase occurs in parallel with increased BrdU labeling, which is currently a \\"gold standard\\" in measuring neurogenesis. Doublecortin was found to bind to the microtubule cytoskeleton. In vivo and in vitro assays show that Doublecortin stabilizes microtubules and causes bundling. Doublecortin is a basic protein with an iso- electric point of 10 typical of microtubule-binding proteins.  Knock out mouse  Double layer hippocampus seen in Doublecortin knock out mice (right panels) compared to the normal hippocampus in wild type mice (left panels). Figure extracted from the work of the laboratory of Fiona Francis In mice where the Doublecortin gene has been knocked out, cortical layers are still correctly formed. However, the hippocampi of these mice show disorganisation in the CA3 region. The normally single layer of pyramidal cells in mutants is seen as a double layer. These mice also have different behavior than their wild type littermates and are epileptic.  Structure  The detailed sequence analysis of Doublecortin and Doublecortin-like proteins allowed the identification of a tandem repeat of evolutionarily conserved Doublecortin (DC) domains. These domains are found in the N terminus of proteins and consists of tandemly repeated copies of an around 80 amino acids region. It has been suggested that the first DC domain of Doublecortin binds tubulin and enhances microtubule polymerisation. Doublecortin has been shown to influence the structure of microtubules. Microtubule nucleated in vitro in the presence of Doublecortin have almost exclusively 13 protofilaments, whereas microtubule nucleated without Doublecortin are present in a range of different sizes.  Interactions  Doublecortin has been shown to interact with PAFAH1B1.  Clinical significance  Doublecortin is mutated in X-linked lissencephaly and the double cortex syndrome, and the clinical manifestations are sex-linked. In males, X-linked lissencephaly produces a smooth brain due to lack of migration of immature neurons, which normally promote folding of the brain surface. Double cortex syndrome is characterized by abnormal migration of neural tissue during development which results in two bands of misplaced neurons within the subcortical white, generating two cortices, giving the name to the syndrome; this finding generally occurs in females. The mutation was discovered by Joseph Gleeson and Christopher A. Walsh in Boston.

The station's studios (which are shared with its other sister stations) are located at the aptly named intersection of Broadcast Drive and Radio Station Road in North Augusta, South Carolina, while a transmitter tower is located on Tobacco Road in Augusta. Magic 100.9 is home to the Tom Joyner morning show and the Doug Banks Show in the afternoons. The station's main competition in the market is Clear Channel Communications' WKSP. History 96.7 FM started in the late 1970s as WRNZ as a Top 40 outlet known as \\"Z96\\". The station changed frequencies from 96.7 to 96.9 and became WMJB in 1984 and WRDW-FM in 1985. In 1991, the station became WAKB. At first, it broadcast SMN's urban adult contemporary format known as \\"The Touch\\" but eventually went local in the late 1990s under the \\"Magic 96.9\\" name. WAKB was sold by Radio One in the mid-2000s Perry Broadcasting as the company decided to focus on larger markets. On Jan. 11, 2008 at 2:58 p.m., WAKB swapped frequencies with WTHB, which had been urban gospel. This happened 2 minutes before Doug Banks launch his afternoon show The Ride with Doug and DeDe began. The station then became Magic 100.9. In 2009, WAKB increased its power from 6,000 to 25,000 watts and moved its tower closer to the city in Hephzibah, Georgia. On December 30, 2009, WAKB dropped the Doug Banks Show (which later returned, airing evenings 7-11pm) and played music in the 3-7 pm time slot. In February 2010, recent WLXC/Columbia midday host Tre' Taylor joined the station and began hosting afternoons. A year later Tre' Taylor left WAKB thus moving Doug Banks to afternoons and leaving the 7pm to midnight currently jockless.

The lake was created in 2004 with the construction of the Randleman Lake Dam. The lake was created to satisfy the drinking water needs of the greater Greensboro area for the next 50 years,General Project Information as well as to provide recreational opportunity. History The lake is in the Cape Fear River basin and was originally proposed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1937.Randleman Lake History Congress first authorized funds in 1968, $11 million. By 1980, only preliminary studies had been done and the estimated cost was $135 million. Later, in 1987, the US Army Corps of Engineers withdrew support for the project because the \\"cost of the Randleman Dam would outweigh the flood control benefits of building it\\". Later that same year, the local Piedmont Triad Regional Water Authority (PTRWA) proposed a smaller reservoir, with a $57 million price tag, which used 40% less land. Over the next several years, environmental impact statements were offered by the PTRWA, with the final Federal Environmental Impact Statement for the Randleman Lake Project being issued in 2000. On April 6, 2001, the USACE issued a permit to allow construction, which began on August 7 of the same year. On March 1, 2010 the lake officially opened to public recreation. Drinking water The lake's primary purpose is to provide drinking water for Greensboro, North Carolina. This is to be accomplished by treating the raw water in a new water treatment plant in High Point, North Carolina, southwest of Greensboro. The City of Greensboro started receiving treated water from Piedmont Triad Regional Water Authority on October 4, 2010. Recreation Fishing and sailing is permitted in most areas of the lake. Personal watercraft are not allowed, nor sailboats with main masts over in height. Because it is a government run facility for the purpose of providing drinking water, boats are not allowed overnight and other significant restrictions apply to fueling boats within the area.

Much distressed over the fate of the Russian Jews after the persecutions of 1882‚Äì1890, in 1890 he visited the land of Midian and resolved to found a colony there. He had a steam-yacht (Israel) built in Scotland, and went to Krakow personally to select the first immigrants. Twenty-four of these, under the leadership of Friedmann, Baron von Seebach and Lieutenant Thiele, with a doctor, a chemist and a builder, left Cairo in the middle of November 1891. A landing was made at Sharm al-Moza on the east side of the Gulf of Aqaba, but the new colony did not last for more than two months. Internal dissensions broke out between the leaders, who were all Christians, and the Jews. The Egyptian government also feared complications with the Turkish soldiers encamped not far off, and ordered the undertaking to be abandoned. Friedmann, who had sunk 170,000 marks in the project, brought suit against the Egyptian government for ¬£25,000. The Russian consul in Cairo also opened an investigation, and violent denunciatory articles appeared in the Egyptian press, especially in connection with the death of one of the settlers who had been forced to leave the encampment because of insubordination.

The essay was never published in his lifetime, and has been cobbled together from existing lecture notes that Thoreau himself picked over for his other writings, such as Walden and A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. The essay reflects Thoreau's frustration with the multitude of reformersprohibitionists, utopian communists, free love advocates, religious revivalists, and the likewho were roaming about New England at the time hawking their prescriptions for a better world. Thoreau's audience in Boston were of the open-minded liberal varietypeople who were typically the most interested in and the most vulnerable to the charms of these reformersand so Thoreau begins his lecture slyly with a fairly superficial but probably sympathetic attack on the Reformer's great enemy: the Conservative. Further disarming his audience with a witticism or two, he then turns on them by spending the rest of the lecture attacking the major genre of lecturers that they more typically come to hear: the Reformer. His major complaint is much the same as the one he expressed when reviewing John Etzler's technological utopianism (see Paradise (to be) Regained)that the utopianists, and Reformers in general, are too concerned with exerting control over and reshaping The World, or Society, or The Government, or The Family, and not concerned enough about better using the control they already exercise over themselves: He suspects that these Reformers are acting from some subconscious motive (or, using less psychoanalytic terms: \\"some obscure, and perhaps unrecognized private grievance\\") that is overtly philanthropic, but covertly a scheme for avoiding the real necessity for self-reform. He reminds the Reformers that they speak with their deeds more than with their wordsthat if \\"the lecturer against the use of money is paid for his lecture, ‚Ä¶ that is the precept which [men] hear and believe, and they have a great deal of sympathy with him\\"and noting that it's easy to lecture about \\"non-resistance\\" but the proof of the pudding is when \\"one Mr. Resistance\\" steps forward to take part in the debate. He notes: > For the most part by simply agreeing in opinion with the preacher and > Reformer I defend myself and get rid of him, for he really asks for no > sympathy with deedsand this trick it would be well for the irritable > Conservative to know and practice. So he recommends that Reformers, and those interested in Reform, instead work on themselves. He anticipates the objection that would invert his argument by saying that he is recommending a narcissistic evasion of responsibility for grappling with social problems. The problems of the social order, of the political order, of the family, and so on, Thoreau insists, are rooted in individualsthe corrupt institutions are only the symptom: > The disease and disorder in society are wont to be referred to the false > relations in which men live one to another, but strictly speaking there can > be no such thing as a false relation if the condition of the things related > is true. False relations grow out of false conditions.  On-line sources  * Reform and the Reformers at The Picket Line.

It lies about two miles south-east of the city centre, on the north bank of the estuary of the River Exe. Historically an estate known as Weare, part of the manor of Topsham, was in this area. From the late 13th century, the construction of weirs in the River Exe by the Countess, and later, the Earls of Devon damaged the prosperity of Exeter to the benefit of Topsham which was downstream of the obstructions, and was owned by the Earls. The bridges over the river and the adjacent Exeter Ship Canal were for many years a traffic bottleneck, until the completion of the last section of the M5 motorway, further downstream, in 1977. History The manor of Topsham was granted by King Henry I to Richard de Redvers and became part of his feudal barony of Plympton. The estate, or sub-manor of Weare was part of this. The present manor house was built in Georgian style by Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet in about 1804. It is now the club house of Exeter Golf and Country Club.Cherry, Bridget & Pevsner, Nikolaus, The Buildings of England: Devon. Yale University Press, 2004. p. 441\\\\. . The weir was commonly known as Countess Wear as early as the fourteenth century: it is named after a weir that Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon is said to have erected in the river hereabouts in the late 13th century. The details of the weir's construction are uncertain: a source of 1290 states that the countess had it built in 1284 and thereby damaged the salmon fishing and prevented boats from reaching Exeter; but a later source claims that her weir was built before 1272, leaving a thirty-foot gap in the centre through which boats could pass, until it was blocked between 1307 and 1377 by her cousin Hugh de Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon and his son, Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd/10th Earl of Devon. The weirs built by the Earls of Devon across the river prevented ships reaching Exeter, thereby forcing merchants to land goods at their port of Topsham, which therefore prospered. Despite several petitions to the king by the people of Exeter, the weirs remained until 1538 when Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter was attainted which resulted in all his possessions reverting to the Crown. In 1540, an Act of Parliament was passed to remove the obstructions, but it was found to be impossible to restore the navigation, and work was soon started to build the Exeter Canal to bypass the blocked section of the river. Countess Isabella also constructed a corn mill in the area in 1284. It was rebuilt as a paper mill in 1658, destroyed by fire in the early 19th century and restored and in continued operation until 1885. The remains of the building are still standing. During World War II, Countess Wear was the location of a US Navy base, and the bridge over the canal was used for rehearsing a glider attack on the Pegasus and Horsa Bridges in Normandy by the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. A plaque to commemorate this event was installed on the bridge in 1994. After the war, accommodation at the navy base was converted into temporary housing for people in Exeter whose homes had been damaged or destroyed. Transport Bascule bridge over the Exeter Canal Countess Wear lends its name to a nearby set of bridges across the River Exe and the Exeter Canal. The first bridge was built in 1774 and was originally tolled, charging 1 penny for foot traffic and 1 shilling for a coach and six horses. It originally had six arches, in 1842 the two central arches were replaced by a 60ft arch to allow boats to pass through. In 1935, the bridges were reconstructed for motor traffic as part of a bypass around Exeter, which had become increasingly congested as a bottleneck for holiday traffic heading to southwest England. The river bridge was widened from to to allow two-way traffic with a pair of footpaths. This bridge was Grade II listed in 2004. The canal was crossed by a new electric swing bridge. The new bridges were opened by the Minister of Transport, Leslie Burgin on 22 February 1938 at a total cost of ¬£230,000. A bascule bridge was built alongside the swing bridge to increase traffic flow in 1972, and although this greatly improved traffic flow, the bridges were still inadequate for modern-day traffic requirements, leading to the parallel M5 motorway being constructed downstream. The replacement motorway was opened by the Prime Minister, James Callaghan in May 1977. At the centre of the area is the Countess Wear roundabout, where the old Exeter Bypass meets the crossroads for the Topsham Road. Education There are three schools in the area: * Countess Wear Community SchoolCountess Wear Community School website * Southbrook SchoolSouthbrook School website * The West of England School for the Partially Sighted Community buildings There is one church in the area: * St Luke's Church (1837-38), Countess Wear Road.

The current Executive Director is Susan Fan. History The association was founded in 1936 as the Hong Kong Eugenics League (È¶ôÊ∏ØÂÑ™ÁîüÂ≠∏ÊúÉ). In 1950, it changed its name officially to the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong. It became one of the founding members of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1952. At the beginning, FPAHK used individual contacts to do its task, spreading the Family Planning message. Subsequently, it started a clinic service. In 1956, it set up the first subfertility clinic. In 1955, the Hong Kong government began subsidising FPAHKs activities. From 1964 on, FPAHK received financial support by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. In 1967, FPAHK ran the first Hong Kong Family Planning Knowledge, Attitude & Practice (KAP) Survey („ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÂÆ∂Â∫≠Ë®àÂäÉÁü•Ë≠ò„ÄÅÊÖãÂ∫¶ÂèäÂØ¶Ë°åË™øÊü•„Äç) and started sex education. Soon after, the Hong Kong Department of Health started to take over the FPAHK sub-fertility clinics. At the same time, FPAHK started its \\"Two is enough\\" („ÄåÂÖ©ÂÄãÂ§†ÂìÇÊï∏„Äç) campaign. To further publicise its campaign, FPAHK made a poster of artist Petrina Fung playing with her kids, with the caption \\"No need for lots of babies, have two at most\\". In 1986, FPAHK began to diversify its services and research with the establishment of the first health centre for teenagers at Causeway Bay. In 1989, FPAHK's new headquarters at Wanchai Southorn Centre began operations. After that, FPAHK pushed through a new artificial insemination service, the family planning awareness initiative, a one-stop service for premarital couples, an obstetric examination service, the experimental hormone replacement therapy plan, and initiated the Hong Kong Women's Reproductive and Sexual Health Advocacy Group (È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ©¶Â•≥ÁîüÊÆñËàáÊÄßÂÅ•Â∫∑ÂÄ°Ë≠∞ÁµÑÁπî). The \\"Be a Mr. Able in Family Planning\\" („ÄåÂÆ∂Â∫≠Ë®àÂäÉÔºåË¶ÅÂÅöÂæóÂì•„Äç) campaign was launched to entice men to play an active role in birth control. In 1998, FPAHK began to provide a mobile clinic service. In 1999, the mobile library and menopause clinic service started. On 11 December 2006, the FPAHK's office at Tsuen Wan Centre began operation. In response to the changes of population trend and family value of Hong Kong society, the association suggested \\"Family Big or Small, Family Planning is Best for All\\" to raise public awareness on early family planning. New initiatives were made to meet evolving needs of holistic sexual and reproductive health care, including Well Men Clinic, Cervical Diseases Clinic, Osteoporosis Clinic, Breast Clinic and Sex Therapy. On advocating sexuality education, the association launched a 3-year \\"Youth Sexuality and Love Campaign\\" in 2008, and organized the \\"4th Asian Conference on Sexuality Education\\" in 2010, which was the first of its kind in Hong Kong.

While attending JHU during the early nineties, which at the time had no real theatre program, Ryan Whinnem, Noel Schively, Bill Henry and Ruth Scrandis Henry were all participants in the Hopkins student theatre group, The Barnstormers. Whinnem was so anxious to do Shakespeare that he had gone as far as to start his own splinter group, the Hopkins Classic Players. They performed Romeo and Juliet in a breezeway on campus with a $100 budget. Whinnem figures $50 went for snacks. After graduation the four went their separate ways. When, after residencies in Los Angeles and Boston, Whinnem returned to Baltimore in the summer of 1997, he contacted the other three. Within days the four decided to form their own theatre company. Their mission statement was simple. \\"Mobtown is dedicated to making theatre a popular form of entertainment in Baltimore by producing new topical works and classical works in inventive ways.\\" Their first production, Hamlet, opened in the fall of 1998. Imaginatively staged at the historic St. John's Church in Baltimore City, the production quickly won the new group attention from both the press and other local theatres. The following spring the Company produced Mimi Teahan's Urban Breakdowns for the Baltimore Playwrights Festival and won the Festival's Third Place Production award. For the next several years, Mobtown produced classics such as A Comedy of Errors and Merchant of Venice while continuing to annually participating in the BPF. Without a central theatre to work in, the Company floated from one location to another. In the spring of 2002 Mobtown went to the heart of Baltimore when it staged A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream outdoors in Patterson Park. The park provided a natural amphitheatre that matched Mobtown's ambition. The appearance of live theatre in such an urban outdoor setting brought the Company attention from every corner of Baltimore. Since that first show they have returned to Patterson Park as often as they could, staging classic Shakespeare at affordable prices. Many Baltimore city residents have spent a starry summer night entertained by Mobtown's versions of Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet or Twelfth Night. The Mobtown Theater In the fall of 2003 Mobtown found a home when they took over a vacated theatre at Meadow Mill. Located in Baltimore's classic Hampden Neighborhood, the permanent space meant that for the first time Mobtown could create a permanent season. The 70 seat venue was the perfect home for Mobtown's mix of classical and new work. They opened with a new translation of Moli√®re's The Misanthrope. The new theatre features a large lobby, which allows the theatre to offer plenty space for an after-show beverage, three rehearsal spaces, a large backstage area for set construction and two large offices. When they opened in their new space, Mobtown also formed a partnership with other Baltimore theatre companies looking for production space. Run of the Mill, Company 13, The Unmentionable Theatre Company, the Living Room Theater Company, and several others have all used the Mobtown Theater to great individual success. In 2004 Mobtown saw one of their biggest successes with their presentation of the Obie winning musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. The show played to sold out crowds in November and then did the same when Mobtown was able to bring the show back for a return engagement in January 2005. The production was named to the Baltimore City Paper‚Äôs Best of Stage 2004 and the Greater Baltimore Theater Awards Best Experimental Production for 2004.baltimoretheater.org The play‚Äôs director, Terry Long, was named Director of the Year by the same organization. Also winning awards from GBTA were Jordan Seibert as Best Actor and the production‚Äôs design team of Tony Gallahan and Ed Zarkowski for Outstanding Design. After years of struggle and knocking on the door of success, Mobtown was finally stable and achieving their goals when they faced their first major crisis. In 2006 Artistic Director and founding member Ryan Whinnem was accepted as a Director into the Masters Program for Theatre at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.http://broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=11772 New Era After a long search of replacement candidates for the position of Artistic Director, the Company hired Alex Willis, who is also a graduate of the Johns Hopkins University. Wills had been a Board Member of Fells Point Corner Theatre for over ten years. She had also made a name for herself by directing dozens of productions for various theatre, including Mobtown, Fells Point Theatre and Vagabonds. Over the years, four of her previous productions have been named to the City Paper‚Äôs year-end Top Ten Theatrical Productions List, and the Greater Baltimore Theatre Awards named her 2005 production of Henry Miller‚Äôs The Turn of the Screw as one of the Outstanding Productions of the year. Willis‚Äô first season as Artistic Director started strongly with her direction of Edward Albee's The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? This challenging play won a 2006 year-end Outstanding Production Award from Broadway World. They also named Willis as Outstanding Director Award for the same show. They also presented actress Tiffany James with an Outstanding Supporting Actress Award for her work in the Willis-directed Inventing Van Gogh. Mobtown has made a habit of producing seasons with a wide variety of thematic content. In direct contrast to the serious tones of the Baltimore Premier of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz's A Bicycle Country or Inventing Van Gogh or The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?, the same seasons have also seen Mobtown present Ben Jonson's romp Volpone, a wild burlesque/vaudeville show, Skin (directed by Bradley Burgess), and Carlo Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters. As Mobtown passes its tenth anniversary, it is still committed to bringing the classics to Baltimore. President Karen Moul oversees a dedicated staff that includes Tony Gallahan as Vice President and Ana Pavich as Treasurer. 2007 saw founding member Noel Schively directing Bob Alleman and Matt Sekerke's new translation of Carlo Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters to positive reviews and full houses. 2008 brought one of Baltimore's \\"Movers and Shakers,\\" actress and director Erin Riley to the Mobtown stage for one of the most successful shows in recent Baltimore history \\"Six Dead Queens...and an Inflatable Henry.\\" Actors working at Mobtown have found a challenging work environment led by trained and dedicated craftsmen. Many who work at Mobtown have degrees in Theatre or are working towards a career in Theatre. Recently, several regular performers have gone on to be featured on an international stage. Courtney Ryan, who played Juliet in the 2004 production that was staged outdoors in Patterson Park, followed that role by spending a year studying acting at Lancaster University in England. She was seen in performances throughout the country. In the summer of 2005 Tess Pohlhaus was cast as the lead in the Sheri Wilner‚Äôs Father Joy which was performed as part of The Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. Others who have worked at Mobtown find themselves doing local industrial films, voice-overs or professional film and television work. 2009-2010 saw a resurgence of the Mobtown Players as the finest community theater in the Baltimore area. Baltimore Playwright's Festival Through the years Mobtown has continued to participate in and support the Baltimore Playwright's Festival. The BPF will often use Mobtown's theatre for staged readings of plays under consideration in the Festival. In addition, the BPF will often hold their annual auditions in the same space. Like all participating members of the BPF, Mobtown is responsible for choosing the shows they produce during the summer festival. Over the past ten years Mobtown productions have continued to win awards from the Festival's judges. In 2006, during the twenty-fifth anniversary of the BPF, Mobtown offered a double bill of two one- acts focusing on the family, Return of the 5th Sister by Kimberley Lynne and Sod by Mark Squirek. Both were directed by Whinnem. Lynn's play received second place as Best Play and Third Place for Production while Squirek was named Outstanding Baltimore Playwright for 2006 by Broadway World.

Biography  Hart was born in F√ºrth, a city in the region of Franconia which lies now in Bavaria, Germany. Since 1440, a prospering Jewish community existed in F√ºrth. Hart's original surname was Hirz which he changed when he came to the United States. By 1782, he was residing as a merchant in Philadelphia, and in that year he joined the Mickv√© Israel congregation. He married in 1783 Frances Noah, a sister of Manuel Noah, and their son was Joel Hart. Later he removed to New York and engaged in the commission and brokerage business. On April 2, 1787, he was registered as an elector of the Shearith Israel congregation. By 1792, he had become one of the most successful merchants in the City, and at this time he helped to organize the Board of Stock-Brokers, now known as the New York Stock Exchange, being one of the signatories of the Buttonwood Agreement of 1792 that founded the Exchange. His name also appears in 1799 in a \\"list of owners of houses and lots valued at ¬£2,000 or more.\\" He was one of the founders, in 1802, of the ebra Hesed Veemet, a charitable organization connected with the Shearith Israel congregation.

Wirtualna Polska was founded in 1995 and is known as the first existing internet portal in Poland. History Wirtualna Polska was created by Leszek Bogdanowicz, Damian Wo≈∫niak, Marek Borzestowski and Jacek Kawalec at Politechnika Gda≈Ñska in Gda≈Ñsk, who met each other via the Internet. The early forum of ideas turned in March 1995 into a service using the name Wirtualna Polska. Initially, it was available on www.wp.cnt.pl (CNT = Centrum Nowych Technologii, Centre of New Technologies). In 1998, it was moved to www.wp.pl, which is its current address. In the beginning, Wirtualna Polska functioned as a catalogue of websites and then was modified into a web portal offering a number of complex services. Many of the activities of the portal at the Internet market were cutting edge. Wirtualna Polska used XHTML and it was the first portal to create a catalogue of web sites with a possibility of positioning them. It also initiated personalization and online chats. Apart from a number of news services, WP provided access to such services as free email accounts, the possibility of web hosting, a web engine, and instant messaging service. In February 2014 the Polish o2 Group (‚ÄûGrupa o2‚Äù) together with private equity fund Innova Capital have completed acquisition of Wirtualna Polska. The combined companies started to operate on the market under the one name ‚ÄúWirtualna Polska‚Äù. The purchase of 100 per cent of the Wirtualna Polska shares from subsidiary of Orange Polska SA (formerly TP SA) by the Polish o2 Group completed the formal process of forming the new Wirtualna Polska Group. Transactions have been approved by the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection. In 2016 Innova Capital, the leading CEE private equity fund, sold its 27% stake in Wirtualna Polska Holding SA for PLN 50.00 per share.

Both male and female birds have black bills and dark legs, however adults have dimorphic plumage. During the breeding season, males have a black horizontal head bar, two incomplete dark breast-bands on each side of their breast, black ear coverts and a rufous nape and crown (although there is some variation between breeding populations), whereas the females are paler in these areas, without the dark markings.Arg√ºelles-Tic√≥, A., K√ºpper, C., Kelsh, R.N., Kosztol√°nyi, A., Sz√©kely, T. and van Dijk, R.E. 2015.

Brood desertion in Kentish plover: Sex differences in remating opportunities, Behavioral Ecology, 10(2), pp. 185‚Äì190 In the early breeding season, it is easy to distinguish between males and females since the ornaments are very pronounced, but as the breeding season progresses, the differences between the two sexes decrease. Moreover, males have longer tarsi and longer flank feathers than females.Kis, J. and Sz√©kely, T. 2003. Sexually dimorphic breast-feathers in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus. Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 49, 103-110 Longer flank feathers are thought to be an advantage for incubation and brood care, as the quality of feathers is associated with heat insulation.Wolf, B. O. and Walsberg, G. E. 2000. The role of plumage in heat transfer processes of birds. American Zoologist, 40, 575-584 There are multiple significant predictors of plumage ornamentation in Kentish plovers. Firstly, the interaction between the advancement of the breeding season and rainfall seem to affect ornamentation. Male ornaments become more elaborated over the course of a breeding season in regions with high rainfall, whereas in regions with low rainfall, male ornaments become lighter. Secondly, the interaction between the breeding system and the sex can predict the degree of plumage ornamentation. In polygamous populations, the sexual ornaments are more pronounced, generating a stronger sexual dimorphism than in monogamous populations. The difference is especially witnessed in males, whereby the ornaments are darker and smaller in polygamous populations compared to monogamous populations, where males have lighter and larger ornaments. This is thought to be the result of a trade-off between the size and intensity of the ornaments.Hill, G.E. 1993. Geographic variation in the carotenoid plumage pigmentation of male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). Biol J Linn Soc 49:63‚Äì86 A Male Kentish Plover Distribution, Movement, and Habitats=Distribution Kentish plovers have an extremely wide geographical distribution and their habitats vary not just spatially but environmentally too. They are known to reside and breed in multiple types of habitat, from desert with ground temperatures reaching 50 ¬∞C to tundra. The distribution of this species‚Äô breeding areas covers Europe, Asia and Africa,Vincze, O., Sz√©kely, T., K√ºpper, C., AlRashidi, M., Amat, J.A. et al. 2013. Local Environment but Not Genetic Differentiation Influences Biparental Care in Ten Plover Populations. PLoS ONE 8(4). In Europe, populations are typically found in the west; although there was once a breeding population in Hungary, Kentish plovers no longer breed there. In Africa, populations are found on the southern coast of Senegal and along the Northern coast of the Mediterranean, and the Red Sea coast. The breeding area continues along the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain in the Middle East. Small populations can be found on islands too, such as the Cape Verde archipelago, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. It is a rare vagrant in Australia.Some populations do not migrate, such as the Maio (Cape Verde) population, however other populations can migrate reasonable distances, for example, plovers that spend winter in North Africa have been known to migrate to Turkey and Greece in the spring. Some birds breeding in western Europe are not known to travel very far, just within Europe, however some do travel, mainly to Western Africa.Meininger, P., Sz√©kely, T., and Scott, D. 2009. Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus. In: Delaney, S., Scott, D. A., Dodman, T., Stroud, D. A. An atlas of wader populations in Africa and Eurasia. Wetlands International, pp 229-235. Habitats and Movement The breeding habitats are most commonly alkali lake shores, wetlands, salt marshes, and coastland, which is fitting with the results of a study that investigated what makes an environment suitable for a breeding habitat for the Kentish plover. By analysing 4 variables of all known nests, the study found that plovers prefer to nest in areas of low elevation, low vegetation, high moisture and places faraway from human activity and settlements,. Kentish Plover nest There have been observations of parents moving their chicks from poor food areas to better food areas, with chicks subsequently growing stronger in the high food areas. This suggests that parents strategically move their chicks and change habitats. Moving young has benefits: protection from predators, obtaining more food, avoiding competition for food and space, avoiding potential infanticide due to competition, and avoiding territory defences from others. However, this is a trade-off as there are also costs to moving young: moving expends a lot of energy, especially in young, therefore chick growth may be stunted as energy is used on movement rather than growth, the chance of mortality due to starvation or predation increases whilst moving through open areas and the area of high food may have a lot of predators in it already. Overall, chick growth and brood survival benefit from moving to a higher food area, therefore increasing reproductive success of parents, hence why the parents move their chicks. The study also found that the larger and heavier females were more likely to move chicks, perhaps because they could defend their chicks from neighbouring parents Kosztol√°nyi, A., Sz√©kely, T. and Cuthill, I.C. 2007.

It is known that breeding pairs return to breed with each other the following year, however mate changes have also been observed both between and within breeding seasons.Fraga, R.M. and Amat, J.A. 1996. Breeding biology of a Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) population in an inland saline lake. Available at: http://www.ardeola.org/files/319.pdfSz√©kely, T. and Lessells, C. M. 1993. Mate change by Kentish Plovers Charadrius alexandrinus. Ornis Scand.2 4: 317-322 Along with mate changes, EPF's (extra pair fertilisations) are also witnessed in some populations, by females copulating with extra-pair males (EPP- extra pair paternity), or males copulating with extra pair females, who then lay their eggs in the male's nest (QP- quasi-parasitism). A theory as to why such EPC's occur is that this mechanism evolved to avoid the deleterious effects of inbreeding. This is supported by a study by Blomqvist et al.,Blomqvist, D., Andersson, M., K√ºpper, C., Cuthill, I.C., Kis, J., Lanctot, R.B., Sandercock, B.K., Sz√©kely, T., Wallander, J. and Kempenaers, B. 2002. Genetic similarity between mates and extra-pair parentage in three species of shorebirds, Nature. 419(6907), pp. 613‚Äì615 showing that EPC's are more common when a breeding pair are more closely related to each other. Another theory is that females may seek out EPC's with high quality males to get the ‚Äògood genes‚Äô for their sons, following the ‚Äòsexy sons‚Äô hypothesis. The breeding season of Kentish plovers lasts on average between 2 and 5 months and varies in the time of year dependent on the particular population. Breeding pairs can replace failed clutches more than once per breeding season, with the same or a different mate, and both males and females can parent more than one brood, due to mate change and EPC's as mentioned above. The courtship displays also vary between populations of plovers, especially between socially monogamous and polygamous populations, for example in polygamous populations the time spent courting is significantly higher for both males and females than in monogamous populations. Courtship displays include active gestures such as flat running, building nest scrapes (small shallow cavities in the ground that are later built into nests), and fighting/running to defend a breeding territory (mainly by males) Carmona-Isunza, M.C., K√ºpper, C., Serrano-Meneses, M.A. and Sz√©kely, T. 2015. Courtship behavior differs between monogamous and polygamous plovers, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 69(12), pp. 2035‚Äì2042 Territories Kentish plovers inhabit sandy areas or salt-marshes in close proximity to water. Inland populations can be found near alkaline or saline lakes, ponds or reservoirs. The populations inhabiting the coastal regions can be found in semi-desert habitats i.e. on barren beaches, near lagoons and sand extractions on beaches or dunes. Salina do Porto Ingles, the habitat of Kentish Plovers in Maio, Cape Verde Kentish plovers are territorial shorebirds; the male usually has a territory and attracts females with courtship displays. The parents are actively defending their nest territories from predators by chasing, fighting or posturing them. When approached by predators in close proximity to the nest, the Kentish plovers quickly run away from the nest and start doing distraction displays to focus the predator's attention on themselves and lure them away from the nest. These displays include calling or crawling on the ground flapping their wings. Males tend to be more aggressive than females. When a plover's territory has been invaded, it invades a neighboring family's territory. This is when fights between males frequently occur because the plovers see their broods threatened. During such fights, it occurs that chicks get injured or even killed.Kosztol√°nyi & Sz√©kely, pers. obs. When approached by a predator, chicks usually try to find a spot where they can hide, crouch down and stay motionless to remain unseen. When they are older, they try to run away with their parents. Nesting and Incubation A Kentish Plover nest, with a standard grey card Kentish plovers either nest solitarily or in a loose semicolonial manner. They are ground-nesting birds that lay their eggs in small shallow scrapes prepared by the male during courtship on the bare ground. Selection of the breeding ground is essential for the survival of nests and broods; nests are placed near the water on bare earth or in sparse vegetation; often on slightly elevated sites in order to have a good view of the surroundings to spot predators from a distance or near small bushes, plants or grass clusters,Snow, D.W. and Perrins, C.M. 1998. The Birds of the Western Palearctic, Volume 1: Non-Passerines. Oxford University Press, Oxford where the eggs are partly sheltered from predators. Nests are filled with nest material i.e. pebble stones, small parts of shells, fish bones, small twigs, grass and other debris. The modal clutch size comprises three eggs, although some nests are already completed with one or two eggs. In fresh or incomplete nests, the eggs tend to be fully exposed, but as the incubation period progresses, the amount of nest material increases and the eggs become practically completely covered. During the incubation period, the Kentish plover recesses for variable periods of time mainly to forage or to perform other activities essential for self-maintenance. To compensate for the resulting lack of presence and increased predation risk, they use nest materials to cover and hence camouflage the eggs and keep them insulated. Kentish plovers regulate the amount of nest material actively. This was shown experimentally in a study by increasing or decreasing the amount of nest material artificially. Within 24hrs, the plovers had restored the amount of nest material back to original. This is of advantage because nest materials help a good insulation of eggs, therefore preventing egg temperature fluctuations Reid, J.M., Cresswell, W., Holt, S., Mellanby, R.J., Whit√©eld, D.P. and Ruxton, G.D. 2002. Nest scrape design and clutch heat loss in pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos). Functional Ecology, 16(3), 305-312) (hence avoiding embryo hypothermia) and reducing the energetic costs of incubation for the parents. By regulating the amount of nest material, the Kentish plovers balances the advantages i.e. insulation and anti-predator defence and the disadvantages of nest material i.e. overheating. Incubation is the process by which the eggs are kept at optimal temperature i.e. between 37 ¬∞C and 38 ¬∞C for the embryonic development of birds with most of the heat deriving from the incubating bird.Deeming, D.C. 2002. Importance and evolution of incubation in avian reproduction. In: Avian incubation: behaviour, environment, and evolution. Deeming, D.C., ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, p. 1-7 Kentish plover eggs are incubated for 20‚Äì25 days by both sexes; females mostly incubate during the day whilst males incubate during the night.Kosztol√°nyi, A. and Sz√©kely, T. 2002. Using a transponder system to monitor incubation routines of snowy plovers. J. Field Ornithol. (in press) Female Kentish plovers usually lose mass during the day, which is unexpected since they get relieved by the males for a variable amount of time. The loss would be much higher if the females were to incubate alone. This loss is a cost of incubation due to the depletion of fat stores and the evaporation of water.Szentirmai, I., Kosztol√°nyi, A. and Sz√©kely, T. 2001. Daily changes in body mass of incubating Kentish Plovers. Ornis Hung. 11: 27-32 Parental Care A Kentish Plover Chick Parental care is variable within birds and the Kentish plover has a slightly different mechanism to other shorebirds. As discussed above, both parents incubate the eggs, however both parents do not always stick around once the eggs have hatched. It is not unusual for one parent to leave the chicks after a variable amount of time; this is referred to as brood desertion. Brood desertion is the ‚Äòtermination of care, by either one or both parents, before the offspring are capable of surviving independently‚Äô Fujioka, M. 1989. Mate and nestling desertion in colonial little egrets. Auk 106:292-302 and usually occurs after one week of the brood being accompanied by both parents. Brood desertion has been observed in both males and females, however females desert the brood significantly more frequently than males. Studies have shown that both the male and female Kentish plover can provide adequate care for their brood on their own, so it is not the differences in the ability of the parents that determines which parent deserts the brood and which stays to care for the chicks. However, studies have also shown that after desertion females have a larger chance of breeding success than males, potentially due to many Kentish plover populations maintaining a male-biased OSR (operational sex ratio - the ratio of males actively breeding to females). Therefore, is it hypothesized that the amount of reproductive success gained by desertion is what actually determines who deserts the brood,.Cuthill, I., Sz√©kely, T., McNamara, J. and Houston, A. 2002. Why do birds get divorced? NERC News Spring: 6-7 In short, males and females can care for their brood equally, however females gain more by deserting their brood than males, resulting in a higher amount of female desertion over male. The non-deserting parent can continue to brood their chicks up to 80% of the time for over 20 days after hatching, as precocial young are vulnerable and exposed to external temperatures.

Funct Ecol 20:157‚Äì165 Status and Conservation=Status The Kentish plover is classified as Least Concern on the Red List Category because it has a very large population range. It is not near the threshold for ‚ÄòVulnerable‚Äô under the population size (<10,000 mature individuals with a constant decline reaching >10% within the next 10 years or three generations), since the global population is estimated being very large with 100,000 - 499,999 mature individuals. A closer estimate, needing further verification, is that the population size lies between 290,000 and 460,000 individuals. Moreover, the Kentish plover does not reach the threshold for being ‚ÄòVulnerable‚Äô on a level of range size (the area of occurrence being <20,000km2 in combination with a decline of population size, habitat area/quality or range size) because it is distributed over an area of 70,800,000 km2. Finally, although there is a decline in global population size, it does not reach the threshold for ‚ÄòVulnerable‚Äô in terms of population trend meaning >30% decline over 10 years or three generations.BirdLife International. 2017. Species factsheet: Charadrius alexandrinus. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org A Kentish Plover chick hatching, along with its sibling and an egg Trends The global population size of the Kentish plover is continuously declining although for some populations the trends are unknown.Wetlands International. 2006. Waterbird Population Estimates ‚Äì Fourth Edition. Wetlands International, Wageningen, The Netherlands The European population being estimated at 21,500-34,800 pairs, forming around 15% of the global range, is thought to decrease by less than 25% in 15 years/three generations. Threats A major threat to this species is habitat loss and disturbance. Human activity such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large numbers of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Breeding birds respond to human disturbance disproportionately when dogs are present, as these situations are interpreted in a context of greater risk of predation. Natural predators are also a problem, as many of these predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the White-tailed Mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the Grey Monitors (Varanus griseus) in Al- Wathba Wetland Reserve. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the 'honey pot',AlRashidi, M., Kosztol√°nyi, A., Shobrak, M. and Sz√©kely, T. 2011. Breeding ecology of the Kentish Plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, in the Farasan islands, Saudi Arabia, Zoology in the Middle East. 53(1), pp. 15‚Äì24Rice, R., Engel, N. 2016. Breeding ecology of Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus in Maio, Cape Verde. Unpublished Fieldwork Report, University of Bath Global warming and climate change also plays a role in the decline of areas available for plovers to breed and reside in. It is known that the Kentish plover prefers to build its nests on low-elevated land close to water, and a study untaken in Saudi Arabia discovered that 11% of nests in the study site were in fact below sea level, therefore rising sea levels are predicted to have disastrous consequences for these low-sitting nests,.AlRashidi, M., Shobrak, M., Al-Eissa, M.S. and Sz√©kely, T. 2012. Integrating spatial data and shorebird nesting locations to predict the potential future impact of global warming on coastal habitats: A case study on Farasan islands, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences. 19(3), pp. 311‚Äì315 Management The Kentish plover is currently on the Annex I of the EU Birds Directive and Annex II of the Bern Convention. Conservation actions proposed to protect the species include the conservation of their natural habitat by creating or elaborating protected areas at breeding sites. This is essential to stop pollution, land reclamation and urbanisation. Human interaction should be controlled and kept at a minimum.

The main area of study is that commonly known as the Old Testament to Christians (and Tanakh to Jews), but Christians have occasionally taken an interest in the Talmud, and Kabbalah. The early fathers of the Christian Church got their knowledge of Hebrew traditions (Masoretic, Midrashim, Aggadah) from their Jewish teachers. This is seen especially in the exegesis of Justin Martyr, Aphraates, Ephraem Syrus, and Origen of Alexandria. Jerome's teachers are even mentioned by name‚Äîe.g., Bar ·∏§anina (Hananiah). Middle Ages Syriac Christians have always been reading and using Hebrew texts. In western Christianity, however, knowledge of Hebrew was historically scarce outside of converts from Judaism.Aryeh Grabois, \\"Christian Hebraists\\", in Joseph Strayer (ed.), The Dictionary of the Middle Ages (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983), vol. 3, pp. 313‚Äì14. It has often been claimed that the Venerable Bede (d.735) knew something of Hebrew, but his knowledge appears to have been gleaned entirely from St Jerome.E. F. Sutcliffe, \\"The Venerable Bede's Knowledge of Hebrew\\", Biblica 16 3 (1935): 300‚Äì06. The same may be said of Alcuin (b. 735), who revised the Biblical translation of Jerome. The ninth-century Pseudo-Jerome, who worked in the circle of Rabanus Maurus (d.856), had knowledge of Hebrew. During the Twelfth-Century Renaissance, contact between Christian and Jewish scholars increased. Peter Abelard (d.1142) recommended Christian scholars take up the language of the Old Testament and many followed this recommendation. The School of Saint Victor became the centre of Hebraism in western Europe. The school of Toledo also worked with Hebrew, but it was secondary to Arabic. Adam of Saint Victor (d.1146) was the most prominent Victorine Hebraist and his student, Herbert of Bosham (fl.1162‚Äì89), studied with Abraham ibn Ezra (d.c.1167) to acquire deeper grammatical understanding. The Cistercian tradition of Hebrew studies began with Nicholas Manjacoria. In the thirteenth century, Hebrew learning declined among native Christians, while converts from Judaism mainly used their knowledge polemically against their co-ethnics. The tradition of scholarly Hebraism was strongest in England.The \\"Magister Andreas, natione Anglus\\" mentioned by Roger Bacon, and identified by S. R. Hirsch with an Augustinian monk who lived about 1150, must at least have been able to read the Bible in the Hebrew original. Among the prominent English Hebraists were Alexander Neckham (d.1217); Stephen Langton (d.1228), who composed a Hebrew‚ÄìLatin dictionary of Biblical terms; William de la Mare (fl.1272‚Äì79), who was patronised by Robert Grosseteste (d.1253); and Roger Bacon (d.c.1292), who wrote Hebrew grammar. In the fourteenth century, the Franciscans and Dominicans took up Hebrew, but their purpose was evangelical. They were instrumental, however, in setting up chairs of Hebrew in universities across Europe. The ecumenical Council of Vienne (1312) ordered chairs established at the universities of Rome, Oxford, Paris, Salamanca and Bologna. Paris had the leading Hebraist of the period in Nicholas of Lyra (d.1349), while following him was Bishop Paul of Burgos (d.1435), a Jewish convert. Renaissance It was not, however, until the end of the 15th century that the Renaissance and the Reformation, while awakening a new interest in the classics, brought about a return to the original text of Scripture and an attempt to understand the later literature of the Jews. Hieronymus Buslidius, the friend of Erasmus, gave more than 20,000 francs to establish a Hebrew chair at Louvain; as the chair of Hebrew at the University of Paris, Francis offered the chair to Elijah Levita, the friend of Cardinal √Ügidius of Viterbo, who declined to accept it. Cardinal Grimani and other dignitaries, both of the state and of the Church, studied Hebrew and the Kabbalah with Jewish teachers; even the warrior Guido Rangoni attempted the Hebrew language with the aid of Jacob Mantino (1526). Pico de la Mirandola (d. 1494) was the first to collect Hebrew manuscripts, and Reuchlin was the first to write a dictionary and short grammar of the Hebrew language (1506). A more detailed grammar was published by Otto Walper in 1590. But interest still centered wholly around the Bible and the expository literature immediately connected therewith. During the whole of the 16th century it was Hebrew grammar and Jewish exegesis that claimed attention. Christian scholars were not ashamed to be the students of Jewish teachers. In fact, one of the most noted Hebraists of this period was Immanuel Tremellius (1510-1580), born Jewish and converted first to Catholicism and soon thereafter became a Calvinist, producing the main Reformed translation of the Hebrew Bible into Latin (he also translated the New Testament from the Syriac into Latin). Sebastian M√ºnster (d. 1552) was known as a grammarian; Pellicanus (d. 1556) and Pagninius (d. 1541), as lexicographers; Daniel Bomberg (d. 1549), as a printer of Hebrew books. Arius Montanus (d. 1598) edited the Masorah and the Travels of Benjamin of Tudela. Widmanstadt (1523), living in a colony of Spanish Jewish refugees in Naples, studied Hebrew with David ibn Ya'ya and Baruch of Benevento, and collected the Hebrew manuscripts which formed the basis of the Hebrew division of the Royal Library at Munich. Vatabl√© (d. 1547) made use of Rashi's commentary. Conrad Gesner (d. 1565) was the first Christian to compile a catalogue of Hebrew books; Jacob Christmann (d. 1613) busied himself with the Jewish calendar, and Drusius (d. 1616) with the ethical writings of the Jews. 17th century Johannes Buxtorf (d. 1629) marks a turning-point in the study of Jewish literature by Christians. He not only studied the Targum and the Talmud, but endeavored to understand Jewish history, and he was the first real bibliographer. Women showed an interest: Anna Maria Schurman, the \\"star of the century\\", in the Dutch Republic; Dorothea Moore in England; Queen Christina of Sweden (d. 1689); Maria Dorothea, consort of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar; Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick of the Palatinate; Maria Eleanora, wife of Charles Ludwig of the Palatinate; Antonia, daughter of Duke Eberhard of W√ºrttemberg. Through Buxtorf a serious attempt was made to understand the post-Biblical literature, and many of the most important works were translated into Latin. In this connection the following names may be mentioned: Johannes Cocceius (d. 1667); Constantin L'Empereur (d. 1648); John Lightfoot (d. 1675); Johann Leusden (d. 1699); and especially Surenhuis (1698), who gave a complete translation of the Mishnah; Jewish theology was studied by Carpzov (d. 1699), Wagenseil (1705; whose letters show how he gathered information), and Johann Stephan Rittangel (1641); antiquities, by Samuel Bochart (d. 1667), Hottinger (d. 1667), Hyde (d. 1700), Trigland (d. 1705), Breithaupt (1707), and Johann Jakob Schudt (d. 1722). It was a time in which the Christian theologian studied Hebrew and rabbinics before taking up his specific theological study. Hackspan (d. 1659) wrote upon the value to the theologian of studying the works of the Rabbis. Their writings on the Bible were read by Schickard (1635), Humphrey Hody (d. 1706), and Richard Simon (d. 1712), while catalogues of Hebrew collections were published by Plantavitius (d. 1651), Le Long (d. 1721), and Montfaucon (d. 1741). Hottinger gave this literature a place in his Bibliotheca Orientalis; Otho (1672) wrote a biographical lexicon of the Mishnah teachers; and Bartolocci's Bibliotheca Rabbinica (1675) was a worthy continuation of these bibliographical labors. 18th century The first half of the 18th century contains the names of three important scholars. Jacques Basnage knew no Hebrew, but his L'Histoire de la Religion des Juifs was the first attempt at a complete presentation of the history of Judaism. The Entdecktes Judenthum of Eisenmenger (d.1704) exhibits a mass of Jewish learning. Johann Christoph Wolf (d. 1739), who, with the help of the Oppenheimer library, was able to produce his Bibliotheca Hebr√¶a, which laid the foundation for all later works in Hebrew bibliography. Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz (d. 1797), though not a scholarly Hebraist, gave an accurate account of Jewish ceremonials. By the side of these stand Bashuysen (d. 1750), the translator and printer of Hebrew books; Reland (d. 1718), the first to use Talmudic material for the study of the geography of Palestine; the bibliographers Unger (d. 1719) and Gagnier (d. 1720), who gave Wolf his information regarding the manuscripts in the Bodleian; J. H. Michaelis (d. 1738) and Mai (d. 1732), who compiled a catalogue of the Uffenbach library; Baratier (d. 1740), the youthful prodigy, who wrote on Benjamin of Tudela; Mill (d. 1756), who treated rabbinical exegesis; and W√§hner (1762), who described Hebrew antiquities. Biagio Ugolini (1744) is said to have been a converted Jew, and therefore finds no place here. Special mention should be made of Ezra Stiles, the learned president of Yale College (1778), certainly the most learned Christian student of post- Biblical Jewish literature that America has produced. Early 19th century Towards the end of the 18th century such friends of Hebrew literature became ever rarer. The rise of Biblical criticism and of the study of other Semitic languages engaged the whole interest of Semitic scholars. Even Rabe, the translator of the Mishnah into German (d. 1798), Semmler, Michaelis, Tychsen (d. 1815), and Sylvestre de Sacy (d. 1838) can hardly be mentioned by the side of the humanists of previous centuries. Interest in the text of the Bible caused some work to be done in the collecting of Hebrew manuscripts, especially by Benjamin Kennicott in England (1776‚Äì80) and Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi in Italy (1784‚Äì88). The last-named made a valuable collection of Hebrew manuscripts; and by his side may be mentioned Joseph Pasinus (or Giuseppe Passini) in Turin (d. 1749), Antonio Maria Biscioni in Florence (d. 1752), Giuseppe Simone Assemani in Rome, and Ury in Oxford (d. 1787). At the universities The downward trend continued in the first half of the 19th century; Jewish literature became less and less a subject of investigation by Christians; and when it was studied it was generally for the purpose of forging weapons against the people whose literature it was. This is seen in such works as A. T. Hartmann's Thesaurus Lingu√¶ Hebr. c Mischna Augendi (1825), in Winer's Biblisches Real W√∂rterbuch, and even in the works of Hitzig and Ewald. There was no understanding even of the period of Jewish history during which Christianity arose and developed; and David Strauss's complaint in regard to this was only too well founded. During the second half of the 19th century, however, the idea gained currency that there was something to be learned by going back to the sources of this history; but only a very few of the universities made a place for this study in their curricula. At the beginning of the 18th century David Rudolph of Liegnitz included Rabbinisch und Chald√§isch among the Oriental languages which he taught at Heidelberg; but he had few imitators; and in the 19th century, apart from a few stray courses, such as Emil Kautzsch's on Kimhi at T√ºbingen, Lagarde's on Al-·∏§arizi at G√∂ttingen, and Strack's on the Mishnah at Berlin, the whole of rabbinic literature was ignored by European universities. Honorable exceptions in this respect were furnished in the universities of Oxford (where A. Cowley was sublibrarian of the Bodleian Library) and Cambridge (which has produced such scholars as W. H. Lowe, Matthews, and Charles Taylor) in England, and in Columbia University, the University of California, the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University, in America. The Jews had been allowed to work out by themselves the new Jewish science (J√ºdische Wissenschaft), little attention being paid to that work by others. In more recent times Christian scholars have given Jewish literature their attention. Abb√© Pietro Perreau has done good service by his many articles on the literature of the Jews in the Middle Ages and by the assistance he has given to scholars from the Hebrew manuscripts at Parma; Martin Hartmann has translated and commentated the \\"Mete·∏≥ Sefatayim\\" of Immanuel Frances (Berlin, 1894); Thomas Robinson has collected some good material in his The Evangelists and the Mishna (1859). August W√ºnsche, in his \\"Erl√§uterung der Evangelien aus Midrasch und Talmud\\" (1878), enlarged the scope of the inquiry begun by Lightfoot; and his translations from the Midrash opened up the stores of ancient Jewish exegesis. Weber's System der Altsynagogalen Palestinischen Theologie (1880) was, with all its failings, an honest attempt to understand the theology of the Synagogue, followed by Wilhelm Bousset in his Religiondes Judenthums im Neutestamentlichen Zeitalter (1903). Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, should also be mentioned for his publication of Proven√ßal Jewish poetry. Late 19th century The Institutum Judaicum in Leipzig, founded by Franz Delitzsch, and a similar society bearing the same name in Berlin and founded by Hermann Strack, have attempted, by their various publications, to diffuse in the Christian world a knowledge of Jewish writings. Gustav Dalman has shown by his philological works on Talmudic grammar and lexicography that he is at home in the rabbinic writings. Hermann Strack in Berlin demands special mention not only for his publications dealing with the literature of the Mishnah and the Talmud, but also on account of the fearless manner in which he has combated anti-Semitic prejudice, drawing his material directly from the original sources. Carl Siegfried, in his yearly reports in the Theologischer Jahresbericht, for many years called attention to publications on Jewish subjects, and the mention of such works in the Orientalische Bibliographie has served to bring them more closely to the attention of Christian scholars. The roll of Christian Hebraists in England includes the names of J. W. Etheridge, the author of a popular Introduction to [post- Biblical] Hebrew Literature (1856); Thomas Chenery, translator of Legends from the Midrash (1877), and editor of Al-·∏§arizi's translation of ·∏§ariri; and W. H. Lowe, who edited the Palestinian recension of the Mishnah. In spite, however, of these facts and of the warning given by Lagarde (Symmicta, ii. 147; Mittheilungen, ii. 165), that in order to understand the Bible text itself a deep study of the Halakah is necessary, Christian writers on the life of Jesus continue their disregard of the primary sources. This may be seen in Hausrath's Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte (Kaufmann Gedenkbuch, p. 659), and even in Sch√ºrer (Gesch.), who, though making a great advance upon previous efforts, still relies upon second-hand sources for many of the pictures that he draws (see Abrahams in \\"J. Q. R.\\" xi. 628). Adolf von Harnack, who, in his Dogmengeschichte (3d ed.), endeavors to do some justice to the rabbis of old, in his Wesen des Christenthums (1900), sustains potential historical inaccuracies from a perhaps selective review of Jewish literature of the relevant period, possibly most noticeable in a lack of regard for the Jewish literature and history during the most recent eighteen hundred years.Felix Perles, Was Lehrt Uns Harnack?'

The essay demonstrates a few themes that show up elsewhere in Thoreau's writings. First of these is Thoreau's eagerness to find a hero. Carlyle wrote the book On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History, which Thoreau considered his crowning achievement. While Thoreau as a young man was still looking for a hero to model himself after, he knew that ultimately he would have to cast models aside. He felt that the problem with religion was that when a Christ or a Buddha discovered something magnificent and important, people then spent their lives celebrating (or arguing about) the discovery but never bothering to try and discover it themselves. Thoreau appreciated the attitude of those who would not settle to think pre-conceived thoughts, but who instead wished to break out of the box of religious tradition and think independently for oneself. In Carlyle's case, Thoreau used this same appreciation to praise the \\"Carlylisms\\" that others found to be ostentatious: \\"He does not go to the dictionary, the word-book, but to the word-manufactory itself, and has made endless work for the lexicographers.\\" Thoreau thought Carlyle to be of the \\"Reformer class\\" and that he had greatly contributed to humanity through his writings. \\"The end of man is an action and not a thought, though it be the noblest,\\" Carlyle wrote, and Thoreau sums up Carlyle's philosophy in this way: > One thing is certainthat we had best be doing something in good earnest > henceforth forever; that's an indispensable philosophy.

Speed Test Drill and Controversy In 1967 Vic Moore appeared at the Long Beach International Karate Championships in Long Beach, California and participated in a martial arts speed drill against Jeet Kun Do founder and movie star, Bruce Lee. The point of the speed drill challenge was to stop Lee's famous unstoppable punch. Lee told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the face, and all he had to do was to try to block it. Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready. When Moore nodded in affirmation, Lee glided towards him until he was within striking range. He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore's face, and stopped before impact. Moore blocked all of the punches except the one that Bruce Lee sneakly threw at the end toward his face Moore and Grandmaster Steve Mohammed said that Lee had first told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the body, which Moore blocked. Lee attempted another punch, and Moore blocked it as well. The third punch, which Lee threw to Moore's face, did not come nearly within striking distance. Moore claims that Lee never successfully struck Moore but Moore was able to strike Lee on two successful attempts, immediately after Lee had made the three attempts described above. Moore further claims that Bruce Lee said he was the fastest American he's ever seen and that Lee's media crew repeatedly played the one punch towards Moore's face that did not come within striking range, allegedly in an attempt to give the impression that Lee had thrown eight successive punches and thereby preserve Lee's superstar image.Vic Moore as interviewed in ReferencesExternal links * Vic Moore Martial Arts Biography * * William J.

Grabouw is located some 65 km south-east of Cape Town, over Sir Lowry's Pass from Somerset West, along the N2 highway. The town is the commercial centre for the vast Elgin Valley, the largest single export fruit-producing area in Southern Africa, which extends between the Hottentots-Holland, Kogelberg, Groenland, and Houwhoek Mountains.Grabouw & Elgin: Overberg Municipality Website The town's population at the 2001 census was listed as 21,593. History=Pre-colonial history The original inhabitants of the area were the Khoikhoi pastoralists and the San hunter gatherers. The indigenous people of the region, the Chainouqua Khoi, inhabited a large area on both sides of the Hottentots Holland Mountains. They traded with early European settlers, but were later dispossessed from their lands by the Dutch colonists, who began to move into the area in the late 1600s and took the Chainouqua land for farming.E.

Early historical map of the Grabouw area. Early colonial era The original Chairouqua name for the region where Grabouw is located is unfortunately not known. However a wide range of different names sprung up in colonial times. The town's location was first a stopping point for wagons on the route eastwards from Cape Town, along the route which the N2 highway now follows. The area was known at the time as \\"Koffiekraal\\". Another colonial name for the area was \\"Groenland\\" (\\"Greenland\\" in Dutch) - a name given by early European settlers to various parts of the region, but which now applies only to the mountainous area to the north. The town itself was created on the farm \\"Grietjiesgat\\", bought in 1856 by Wilhelm Langschmidt, a painter from Cape Town, who started the community around his wife's little trading store. Langschmidt named the village after the German town Grabow where he was born. It was initially spelt as \\"Grabau\\".R. Beck, P. van der Merwe: The Migrant Farmer in the History of the Cape Colony. Ohio University Press. 1995. .G. de Beer, A. Paterson, H. Olivier: 160 Years of Export. PPECB. Plattekloof, South Africa. 2003. The town's economic activity has historically been centred on deciduous fruit farming. Now increasingly, the wine and tourism industry is growing. The original train station of Grabouw. Agricultural revolution In the early 1900s, the village and surrounding area underwent an agricultural revolution, that had a profound effect on the Grabouw's development. This was the beginning of deciduous fruit farming, which became the town's main economic activity and correlated with a large growth in the town's population. The local suffragist farmer Antonie Viljoen is recorded as the first purchaser of apple trees in the area. However it was in fact his farm workers who first successfully farmed them, on their own plots, and through their own private initiative. In 1903 the Italian South African Molteno family also began to farm in the area - including two brothers who - together with Viljoen's \\"Oak Valley\\" farms - helped to build the town's deciduous fruit industry. Another influential pioneer for this period in Grabouw's history was a local woman farmer - Kathleen Murray. She was extremely active also in Grabouw community development (and later became an enthusiastic member of the Black Sash movement). These enterprises turned Grabouw into the hub of Southern Africa's largest single export fruit- producing area. Other influential pioneers were the Beukes family and the Franco-Italian immigrant Edmond Lombardi, who created an apple-juice drink he called \\"Appletiser\\", on his nearby farm Applethwaite, and introduced it to the market in 1966.D. Jansen, K. Leresche: Exploring the Cape Winelands. CTP. Penstock Publishing, South Africa. 2015. . Route 9: The Elgin Wine Region pp.142-153.

A large and thriving wine industry has developed across the valley, and wines from the region have won several international awards. The Elgin valley is South Africa's coolest climate wine-growing region and a range of other geographic factors (for example, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, cool temperatures, plentiful winter rainfall, prevailing wind directions, and altitude) have created a set of conditions for wine growing which are markedly different to those in surrounding areas. Of the many varietals grown in the region, special attention has been paid to Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.Elgin Valley Wines Elgin - Wine Searcherhttp://heatherdugmore.co.za/winds-of-change-for-sas-fruit- industry/Elgin Wine Route - South Africa Directory SiteWines of Elgin Grabouw and its surrounding valley is historically significant for South Africa's wine history also because, of all the country's regions, it had one of the earliest movements towards Black ownership of vineyards and wineries. The Elgin winery Thandi was in fact the country's second post-Apartheid winery with significant black involvement (after New Beginnings in Paarl).A. Domine (ed.): Wine. pg 752-769, Ullmann Publishing, 2008. . Economy The town's economy is based on servicing the surrounding agricultural industry, with the Elgin Valley being intensively used for viticulture and the cultivation of apples, pears, plums and other deciduous fruit. This agricultural region produces 65% of South Africa's apple exports. One of the biggest factories in Grabouw is Appletiser which provides the popular Appletiser soft drinks. Altogether, this has earned it the reputation worldwide as the \\"valley of apples\\". The wine industry is an increasingly important component of the town's economy. The surrounding agricultural region has undergone a move from deciduous fruit farming to viticulture, and this has had an effect on Grabouw, as the region's population hub. Tourism is also of importance to the economy. The N2 highway through the valley is extremely busy during the holiday season. Attractions View over the Elgin valley, towards Grabouw The Hottentots Holland Mountains, one of several surrounding mountain ranges. Situated by the Palmiet river in the fertile Elgin valley, Grabouw is surrounded by the Hottentots Holland and Groenland mountains to the north, and the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve to the south. Several routes for exploring the surrounding mountains begin from the town. There is wine and cider tasting on the surrounding farms. A brandy tasting and cellar tour is also available from Oude Molen Distillery which is just outside the town. There is also the annual Elgin Festival, which takes place on the last week-end in October and boasts a wide range of flower displays, fruit, wines and a great variety of local products. Within the town, the Elgin Apple Museum is one of the oldest remaining buildings in Grabouw. It is situated on the banks of the Palmiet River. The Museum depicts the history of the fruit industry in the region. The nearby Grabouw Country Club has scenic views overlooking the Eikenhof dam and pine-covered mountains. Applethwaite Farm and Church, was built in the early 1960s by Edmond Lombardi, the founder of Appletiser. The church was built for the use of the farming community and is interesting because of the Italian marbles and wood carvings of the Stations of the Cross. Climate The town experiences a very mild Mediterranean climate, more moderate than most other Western Cape locales, with abundant rainfall, mostly in the winter months, although strong summer south-easterly winds can sometimes bring squalls. This wind is known as the \\"Black South-Easter\\" for its gusting winds and showers.

By Jan Todd page 214 Apparently a lack of funds prevented him from finishing the course there, and upon leaving he immediately opened up a medical practice in Port Byron, New York.

In 1852, he gave up his practice and went south with her on behalf of her health. Three of her sisters had died of tuberculosis, and she was showing signs of the same disease. Lewis claimed to have used homeopathy to cure his wife Helen's TB, and from that day his so-called \\"Consumption Cure\\"Physical Culture and the Body Beautiful: Purposive Exercise in the Lives of ... By Jan Todd page 6 became well-known and profitable. Helen worked with Lewis on his publications, writing her own column on dress reform and woman's health. Lectures From 1852 till 1860 Lewis was engaged in lecturing on hygiene, temperance and physiology. He began by lecturing on health topics in schools, and then in 1853 gave his first public lecture, addressing the topic of ‚ÄúThe Influence of Christian Women in the Cause of Temperance‚Äù. This lecture stemmed from his experience in joining an organization called ‚ÄúThe Sons of Temperance‚Äù: he had met indifference when he brought up the topic of having women in the organization. In 1856 he visited Paris for a short time to obtain material for his physiology lectures and used the opportunity to attend clinics in some of the city hospitals. New exercise system While lecturing, Lewis began developing a new system of exercises. He felt that, although athletic young men could succeed in the feats required by German gymnastics then prevalent, these exercises did not meet the needs of those who most needed the benefit: boys; old, fat or feeble men; and girls and women. By June 1860, he felt he had developed a satisfactory system, and settled in the vicinity of Boston to publicize it, feeling that ‚ÄúBoston would prove more hospitable to an educational innovation than any other city in the country.‚Äù He was not disappointed. Marble bust of Diocletian Lewis completed in Rome by sculptor Edmonia Lewis in 1868. The Walters Art Museum. Evening classes in gymnastics were organized in West Newton, Newtonville, Newton, Newton Upper Falls, and Watertown. The new system was introduced in a normal school in Framingham, the Concord Hall school and schools in Boston. A public gym for men, women and children opened at 20 Essex Street in Boston. A lecture at a conference in Boston in August 1860 brought the new system to the attention of educators from across the United States. In the spring of 1861, Lewis founded the Normal Institute for Physical Education (also known as Boston Normal Physical Training School). Cornelius C. Felton, president of Harvard, readily consented to serve as its president. Among the 28 directors appeared the names of Governor John A. Andrew, George S. Boutwell, H. I. Bowditch, Rev. James Freeman Clarke, Edward Everett Hale, N. T. Allen and A. Crosby. The members of the first faculty were Thomas H. Hoskins, M.D., professor of anatomy; Josiah Curtis, M.D., professor of physiology; Walter Channing, M.D., professor of hygiene; and Dio Lewis, M.D., professor of gymnastics. In seven years, five hundred pupils were graduated. Lewis's influence had much to do with the establishment of the present system of physical culture in most of the institutions of learning in the United States.Barry J. Fraser and Kenneth George Tobin, International handbook of science education, p. 104. Girls' school For three years, 1864‚Äì1867, Lewis ran a school for girls at Lexington, Massachusetts, in which Theodore Dwight Weld was a leading teacher, and Catharine Beecher was for a time one of the lecturers. In September 1867, the school building was burned, and, although temporary quarters were at once secured in a summer hotel at Spy Pond, the project was abandoned at the close of another year. The number of pupils rose to 140 in the third year, drawn from all over the country, and nearly 300 were enrolled during the whole period. Temperance crusading In the 1870s, Lewis and his mother began leading groups of followers into saloons to pray for their closure. He later lectured in churches claiming miraculous results from conducting such \\"Visitation Bands\\". Lewis‚Äô actions and lectures inspired others to similar action, thus initiating the Women's Crusade against alcohol. Lewis gave a public address in Hillsboro, Ohio, on his fall tour through Ohio called \\"Our Girls\\", that advocated physical exercise and an active life for women. On Sundays he spoke on \\"The Duty of Christian Women in the Cause of Temperance\\". In these lectures he instructed women to ask local dispensers of alcoholic beverages to sign pledges that they would cease to sell. Upon refusal, the women should begin prayer and song services in these establishments. He urged women to be the sole participants in these acts, in order to aggrandize the emotional force of the movement. Women took to the snowy streets, and within three months of their first march, they had driven the liquor business out of 250 towns. By the time the marches ended, over 912 communities in 31 states and territories had experienced the crusades. It was and is still the largest mass movement of women to date.... [Frances Willard], the second national president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, wrote later in her memoirs, that the crusade ‚Äúwas like the fires we used to kindle on the western prairies, a match and a wisp of grass were all that was needed, and behold the spectacle of a prairie on fire sweeping across the landscape, swift as a thousand untrained steeds and no more to be captured than a hurricane\\".Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) web site Lewis claimed that, as a result of them, more than 17,000 drinking establishments were abandoned in Ohio alone in a period of two months. Most of the saloons that closed as a result of prayer vigils opened again a few days later to meet the public demand for alcoholic beverages.National Association for the Children of Alcoholics web site Family Lewis was the brother of jurist and politician Loran L.

It originated in the marshy plains and woodlands of the d√©partement of the Landes, in the Nouvelle- Aquitaine region of south-western France, but is more often reared in the d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, particularly in the arrondissement of Pau. Due to influences from Arab and Welsh blood, it shows more similarity to Oriental horses than to other Celtic breeds. It is used for riding and driving, and is a good trotter.  History  Traditionally, two distinct types of pony or small horse lived in a feral or semi-feral state in the region of south-western France: the L√©don or Poney des Pins in the sandy coastal areas of the Gironde and the ; and the Barthais in the , the marshy meadowlands of the valley of the Adour river. The plantation of the Landes forest and associated swamp drainage operations in the nineteenth century reduced the natural range of these horses. In 1913 the two populations totalled some 2000. The advent of motorised transport led to a decline in the number of animals, both because their usefulness was reduced and because some were the cause of road accidents; during the Second World War, some fell victim to land-mines laid by German forces to prevent coastal landings. After the War, no more than 150 head remained. The Poney des Pins became extinct in about 1950. Recovery of the breed ‚Äì which now consisted only of the Barthais type ‚Äì began in 1967, and a stud-book for the Landais was established in that year. To reduce the effects of inbreeding, some use was made of stallions of Arab and Welsh (Section B) types. In 2007 the Landais was listed by the FAO as \\"critically endangered\\"; in 2014 the total number reported for the breed was 159. Annual births are low: between 2006 and 2013 the number ranged from 36 to 66. A genetic study of French horse breeds in 2008 suggested that, to maximise genetic diversity among the French horse population, conservation priority be given to the Landais and four other breeds. Some Landais ponies live in a semi-feral state with other livestock and wildlife on the banks of the Adour and Luy rivers in the area of Dax in the Landes, but the largest number is found in the arrondissement of Pau, in the d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es- Atlantiques.Others are reared elsewhere in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, and in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes, Centre-Val de Loire, Occitanie and Pays de la Loire regions.  Characteristics  The Landais shows more similarity to Oriental horses than to Celtic breeds. Arab influence can be seen in the head, while the small upright ears are from the Welsh heritage. The legs are fine, the shoulders sloped, and the rump sloping and single. The mane is full, as is the tail, which is carried high. The colours are bay, black, chestnut, liver chestnut, and seal brown; White markings to the face and legs are permitted.  Use  The Landais is used as a riding horse ‚Äì often by children ‚Äì for hacking out and trekking, and in competition sports such as jumping, eventing and dressage. It is an excellent trotter, and is used in trotting races and in competitive driving; a Landais named Jongleur holds the trotting record for the run between Paris and Chartres. The Landais was among the breeds used in the creation of the Poney Fran√ßais de Selle or French Riding Pony.

Noted for its versatility, Christensen's music has been praised by critics. As a solo artist, Christensen has released five albums, and in January 2016 released the Franklin, Tennessee-recorded full-length The Cardinal with her Nashville, Tennessee band, Stone Cupid. Christensen had lived in Nashville since 2013, and her band included some of the city's most well-known musicians. Christensen, a founding member of the Divine Horsemen, has toured extensively with Leonard Cohen. She has performed with artists including Todd Rundgren, Iggy Pop, Public Image Limited, Van Dyke Parks, John Doe, Exene Cervenka, and k.d. lang. Early life Christensen was born in Iowa City and grew up in Newton, Iowa. Her father was a pharmacist and her mother, a nurse, played the organ at local Protestant churches. The oldest of four children, Christensen has three brothers, who were also musicians. Two of her brothers played together in a band, Jonesin', that was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. A lyric soprano, Christensen began singing while she was a child. She performed at churches, and when she was 11 she appeared on the first of two television talent contests. In high school she learned French, and after she graduated she enrolled at the University of Iowa. She planned to learn Chinese, and majored in Asian studies. Career=Early career, the Divine Horsemen During her first year at the University of Iowa, Christensen joined Longshot, a country-rock band; to tour with them, she dropped out of college. In 1978 she began singing with a show band, and after a year on the road, she moved to Austin, Texas. In Austin she performed frequently with jazz artists, including bassist and producer Roscoe Beck of the group Passenger, who would later introduce Christensen to Cohen. In 1981 Christensen moved to Los Angeles. While still performing from time to time with jazz groups, she began to sing with the underground bands of the early Los Angeles punk scene. In 1982, while sitting in with Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs, she met Chris D., a producer and the founder of the seminal LA band, the Flesh Eaters. Impressed by her voice, he booked her as a backup vocalist for a Top Jimmy session he was producing. By 1984, Christensen and Chris D. had founded the Divine Horsemen; in 1985 they were married. The Divine Horsemen's music combined elements of punk, rock, blues roots and country. A reviewer for roots-music magazine No Depression said it \\"foreshadowed the alt-country genre.\\" With a lineup that included members of X, The Blasters, The Gun Club, as well as Texacala Jones and Kid Congo, the band released their largely acoustic debut album, Time Stands Still, in late 1984. As a reviewer said in 2016, \\"Right up there with George Jones and Tammy Wynette, with Julie Christensen harmonizing circles around a despondent Chris D. The twin vocals wander, finish one another's sentences, fight, fuck, laugh, cry and then join together in a gorgeously mismatched duo. Christensen's clear Emmylou-cry looms large.\\" The Divine Horsemen toured frequently and released three studio albums and two EPs between 1984 and 1987. Although they built a substantial following, their success was hampered by alcoholism and addiction within the band. Christensen struggled with a daily heroin habit, and when she got clean in 1987, she left the band and ended her marriage. Leonard Cohen Three months after she left the Divine Horsemen, she was approached by Roscoe Beck about working as a backup vocalist on an upcoming Leonard Cohen tour. Christensen excelled during her audition with Cohen's band‚Äîwith her mother on piano, she had sung Leonard Cohen songs since she was a child. Next, she met with Cohen. He pointed out over lunch that the tour would be grueling, and Christensen responded with stories regarding the years she'd spent on tour with the Divine Horsemen, playing at venues such as CBGB and the Cathay de Grande. Cohen was reportedly charmed. She and Perla Batalla began a 7-month tour as back-up singers for Cohen in March 1988, and continued to tour with him off and on for the next six years. In 2003, Came So Far for Beauty: An Evening of Leonard Cohen Songs was commissioned by the Celebrate Brooklyn Performing Arts Festival with support from the Canadian Consulate General New York. Christensen took part in several performances of Came So Far for Beauty, which were curated and produced by Hal Wilner. In addition to singing with Lou Reed, Nick Cave, Antony, and Anna McGarrigle, she sang \\"A Singer Must Die\\" and dueted with Batalla on \\"Anthem.\\" The documentary film Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man was based on the 2005 Sydney performance of Came So Far for Beauty. Christensen was featured both in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack, released by Verve Forecast in 2006. Solo career and Stone Cupid In 1989 Christensen signed with Polygram Records. Todd Rundgren produced the album, which was slated to be her solo debut. \\"She was unlike a lot of female singers, who may be creative in their songwriting and write suitably for their own delivery, but don't really try a broad range of styles,\\" Rundgren said. \\"It was her ability to sing with conviction in a variety of approaches that made her extraordinary to me.\\" In 1990 Polygram was restructured, and the record was shelved and Christensen dropped from the label. In 1991 Christensen featured in the Barry Levinson-directed film Bugsy, credited as ‚ÄòCiros singer‚Äô. In 1994 Christensen (who had remarried and become a mother) moved from Los Angeles to Ojai, California, where she focused on songwriting and recording as a solo artist. Unable to retrieve the master recordings from the Polygram sessions, she re-recorded some of its material and released it along with several new songs on her solo debut, 1996's Love is Driving. Her second solo album, Soul Driver came out in 2000, and in 2006 and 2007 she released Something Familiar and Where the Fireworks Are, two stylistically distinct records that she wrote and recorded simultaneously. Rather than using her own name, she often performed and recorded using the name Stone Cupid. With 2012's Weeds Like Us, Christensen returned to her folk-rock roots. The album had taken shape several years earlier as an acoustic project which would be produced by Christensen's long time friend and mentor, Kenny Edwards. Edwards died in 2010, succumbing to a blood clot that resulted from the chemotherapy treatment he was undergoing for cancer. Devastated by his loss, Christensen put the album on hold until 2012. Re-envisioned, it was produced by Jeff Turmes, best known for his work with Mavis Staples. Christensen and her family relocated to Nashville in 2013. In addition to performing as a solo artist, she played regularly with a band composed of guitarists Chris Tench and Sergio Webb, bassist Bones Hillman and drummer Steve Latanation. They used the name Stone Cupid, and in January 2016 they released The Cardinal, co-produced by Christensen and Turmes. Personal life Christensen is married to actor John Diehl. Their son, Magnus Jackson Diehl, is a writer, film director, photographer, and actor.

She led the effort to have the Malcolm X House Site recognized for its association with the life of the national civil-rights leader. It was listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and the Nebraska register of historic sites.  Early life  Moore was born in Meridian, Oklahoma. When her father got a job in the meatpacking industry in 1924, her family moved to Omaha, Nebraska. She first worked in a packing plant at age 15, though she claimed to be 16 to get a job scraping fat off animals' hindquarters.  Career  During World War II Moore noticed that while many women were given jobs in the meatpacking industry, African-American women were discriminated against. Moore organized a union called the Defense Women‚Äôs Club of black women who were committed to securing employment and supporting the war effort.Horowitz, R. and Halpern, R. (1999). Work, Race, and Identity: Self-Representation in the Narratives of Black Packinghouse Workers, Oral History Association. Their goals were to promote war bonds and food rationing, child care for working mothers, and securing jobs for black women. They wrote letters to the federal Fair Employment Practices Committee. An official came to Omaha to order the South Omaha packing houses to stop discriminating against black women. Soon after, Moore and some 400 other women were hired. Moore worked in the meatpacking industry for twenty years, managing to retain her position after veterans returned from the war.(nd) \\"The West Out Loud: Western Community\\", Collaborative Digitization Program, Retrieved 4/27/07, inactive link Moore rose to become secretary of the meat cutters‚Äô local union. In 1948, she became secretary of the Omaha Metropolitan Labor Council. She further challenged discrimination in the 1950s, when the meatpacking plants attempted to restrict employment.Horowitz, R. and Halpern, R. (1999). These actions led to Moore's getting fired from the plants; however, she maintained her passion to fight for social justice. Moore was elected chairwoman of the Douglas County Democratic Central Committee in 1971. She was the first black woman to run for the Omaha City Council. Inspired by listening to Malcolm X‚Äôs speeches, Moore decided to start an organization to benefit African-Americans. When she learned her father had lived in the house where Malcolm X had first lived and her family still owned the property, Moore became the founding president of the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation. Her family made their five lots the basis of the foundation's site, eventually acquiring more than 60 lots for the center. She led an effort to have the site recognized (the house was torn down in 1965 before the family recognized its association with the life of Malcolm X.) Today the Foundation works to advance cultural and educational issues. The Foundation has preserved the Malcolm X House Site, 3448 Pinkney Street, and gained its recognition as a Nebraska historical heritage site and listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Foundation has plans to develop the property as a park and link it to a nearby municipal park.(nd) \\"Our Founder\\", Malcolm X Memorial Foundation Website, accessed 13 Jul 2008 Moore continued to look for ways to honor Malcolm X's legacy. In 1989 she proposed renaming the North Omaha Freeway as the Malcolm X Freeway.(January 18, 1989) Letter from the Omaha mayor responding to Moore. She led an early 1990s gathering with the African-American Progressive Action Network and the National Malcolm X Commemoration Commission to celebrate Malcolm X's life.Fuson, K. \\"Omaha woman never forgot legacy of Malcolm X\\", Des Moines Register. In addition to her work in meatpacking and her public life, Moore owned a grocery store in the 1950s, managed several musical quartets and produced a movie, \\"The Sacred Beauty,\\" which starred another Omaha woman.

He is an assistant coach for the men's basketball program at California State University, Long Beach. Braswell previously served as the men's head coach for his alma mater Cal State Northridge, being named the fourth head coach in Northridge's history on April 30, 1996, succeeding the retired Pete Cassidy. Coaching career After graduating from Cal State Northridge in 1985 (with a bachelor's degree in English), Braswell became a teacher and head basketball coach at Cleveland High School in Reseda, Los Angeles. During his four years there, Cleveland won two league titles, and reached the Los Angeles City Section title game in 1986 and 1987. Former NBA player Lucious Harris was a member of Braswell's teams at Cleveland. Braswell's success on the high school level elevated him to a position as assistant coach at Long Beach State. He served there for three years, first under Joe Harrington and then Seth Greenberg. In this period, Long Beach reached the National Invitation Tournament twice. The 49ers would reach the NCAA Tournament the season after Braswell's departure, led by Harris and Bryon Russell, players he had recruited. Braswell's work at Long Beach State led to him being hired as the top assistant to Jerry Green at the University of Oregon. He would also handle the duties of the Ducks' recruiting coordinator during his four seasons in Eugene. With Braswell on the staff, Oregon would reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 34 years in 1995. His final recruiting class at Oregon was ranked 35th in the nation. In 1996, Braswell made his return to his alma mater, Cal State Northridge, as their new head coach. He had immediate success in the 1996‚Äì97 season. The Matadors' 14‚Äì15 record was their best record since moving to Division I in 1990. Despite a sixth-place finish, Braswell's team made a run to the finals of the Big Sky Conference tournament. They would narrowly miss out on an NCAA berth, suffering an 82‚Äì79 defeat to Montana in the championship game. The following season, CSUN again finished near the bottom of the Big Sky conference, but performed well in the tournament, upsetting Eastern Washington in the quarterfinals before losing to host and eventual champion Northern Arizona the next day. Braswell continued to build the Northridge program over the next several years. In 1998‚Äì99, the team went 17‚Äì12. The next year, the record improved to 20‚Äì10, and Braswell's team again made a run to the Big Sky championship game, losing in overtime to Northern Arizona. Braswell would finally break through in the 2000‚Äì01 season. Led by six seniors, Northridge would upset UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, finish atop the Big Sky standings, and win the Big Sky Tournament at home to reach the NCAA Tournament. They would lose to Kansas in the first round to finish 22‚Äì10, Braswell's best season to date. He became a sought-after coaching commodity following the season, but instead signed a six-year extension to stay in Northridge. UCLA did not play Northridge again until the 2008‚Äì09 season after the Matadors' win at Pauley. After 2001, Northridge moved to the Big West Conference. In the 2004 Big West Tournament, his team made an improbable run to finals, winning three games in three nights. They narrowly lost to Pacific, after coming back from a 19-point deficit to tie the game. Braswell has had three winning seasons since joining the Big West, finishing 18‚Äì13 in 2004‚Äì05, 20‚Äì10 in 2007‚Äì08 and a tie for first place in the conference and 17‚Äì13 in 2008‚Äì09 and winning the conference and automatic berth to the NCAA Division I tournament. On March 14, 2009 the Matadors beat University of Pacific in the Big West Tournament Championship game to make their second appearance in the NCAA Division I Tournament. The Matador men's basketball team, faced with adversity both on-and-off the court in 2008‚Äì09, played like champions. In one of the most dramatic, high-energized games in school history, Cal State Northridge recorded a 71‚Äì66 overtime victory over Pacific in the title game of the Big West Conference Tournament on at the Anaheim Convention Center. The Matadors defeated a Tiger team that has given them persistent headaches. In 21 previous meetings, Pacific had won 17 games, including two games earlier in the year. Despite the fact the Matadors raced to what seemed to be an insurmountable 21‚Äì3 lead in the first half, the Tigers gradually sliced the Matador lead and tied the game at 42‚Äì42 with 11:01 left in the game. Pacific fought back to within one point, 54‚Äì53, with 3:04 to play. However, Cal State Northridge refused to let Pacific take the lead. Cal State Northridge took a 61‚Äì56 lead with 1:19 remaining. It seemed like victory was just seconds away. Again, three straight points by Pacific cut the Matador lead to two points, 61‚Äì59, with 60 seconds to play in regulation. Then with five seconds to play, UOP's Michael Kirby was fouled and hit two free throws to send the game into overtime at 61‚Äì61. In the overtime, the Matadors took charge with a three-pointer by Rodrigue Mels to give the Matadors a 64‚Äì61 lead with 4:44 remaining. A lay-up and a free throw by Pacific's Bryan LeDuc tied the game. But a jumper by Rob Haynes, another three-pointer by Mels and two free throws by Mark Hill down the stretch gave the Matadors the win, the Big West Conference Championship, and the school's second berth in the NCAA Tournament. Following the highly dramatic, nerve- wracking game that will go down in history as of the best games in school history, several hundred Matador fans stormed the court to congratulate the team. The post-game celebration also included a rich history in college basketball, the cutting down of the nets by each team member. Then the entire team and coaching staff marched in unison to the press conference. Coach Braswell's overall record at CSUN is 205‚Äì180. In March 2007, Braswell signed a two-year contract extension that kept him in Northridge through the 2008‚Äì09 season. In 2004, Braswell was reprimanded by the university for a failure to provide oversight to an assistant coach who had violated NCAA rules. As a result, the Northridge program was placed on a three-year probation period by the NCAA, ending after the 2005‚Äì06 season. Braswell also has a reputation as being a tough coach. This has led to a high level of attrition amongst his players. During the 2002‚Äì03 season and the immediate aftermath, three underclassmen transferred out of the program to continue their careers elsewhere. In 2003‚Äì04, two players were suspended and another kicked off the team for undisclosed violations. At the end of that season, four more players would transfer out. In 2006‚Äì07, one player quit the team in the middle of the season, and several more left the team afterward. The 2007 senior class marked the first time since 2001 that the Braswell has had three players who were with the program for a full four seasons. Braswell was relieved of his duties on March 19, 2013 after 17 seasons as head coach. In 2013, Braswell was hired by University of Texas at El Paso to serve as the director of basketball operations.Bobby Braswell Tabbed to UTEP Basketball Staff In 2016, he was promoted to assistant coach with the Miners.Bobby Braswell Promoted to Assistant Coach at UTEP In 2018, Braswell returned to Long Beach State as assistant coach.LBSU MEN'S BASKETBALL ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO COACHING STAFF Personal Braswell and his wife, Penny, have two sons and a daughter.Cal State Northridge Matadors coach Bobby Braswell coping with son's illness - ESPN The eldest child, then 22-year-old son, Jeffery Robert Braswell, along with Phannuel Gbewonyo, senior Matadors guard Deon Tresvant, and freshman Matadors guard Dallas Rutherford, was charged on January 7, 2009 with commercial burglary and grand theft.

Although there are many peaks in the park having far greater elevation, Clouds Rest's proximity to the valley gives it a very high degree of visual prominence. Geography The summit can be reached by a trail hike from Tioga Pass Road or a trail hike from Happy Isles by way of Little Yosemite Valley. There are also several technical routes available. Clouds Rest is an ar√™te, a thin, almost knife-like, ridge of rock formed when glaciers eroded away solid rock to form Tenaya Canyon and Little Yosemite Valley. The northwest face, mostly solid granite, rises above Tenaya Creek. History Lafayette H. Bunnell, a medical doctor with the Mariposa Battalion, notes that his party named the summit Clouds Rest because they returned to camp to avoid a snow storm after seeing \\"the clouds rapidly settling down to rest upon that mountain.\\" Recreation There are three main ways to access the summit of Clouds Rest; via the Sunrise Lakes Trailhead off of CA-120 (commonly known as the Northeast Ridge Route); via the Happy Isles Trailhead in Yosemite Valley (commonly known as the South Slope); or via the Northwest Face of the mountain. The Sunrise Lakes Trail is a round trip hike of that begins at an elevation of and gains over to reach the summit at . The summit has wide-ranging 360-degree panoramic views.

The music score was created by John Debney (The Passion of the Christ).  Plot  Most is the story of a single Czech father who takes his eight-year-old son to work with him at the railroad drawbridge where he is the bridge tender. A day before, the boy meets a woman boarding a train, a drug abuser. At the bridge, the father goes into the engine room, and tells his son to stay at the edge of the nearby lake. A ship comes, and the bridge is lifted. Though it is supposed to arrive an hour later, the train happens to arrive. The son sees this, and tries to warn his father, who is currently not paying attention and is unaware of the oncoming train. Just as the oncoming train approaches, his son falls into the drawbridge gear works while attempting to lower the bridge, leaving the father with a horrific choice. The father then lowers the bridge, the gears crushing the boy. The people in the train are completely oblivious to the fact a boy died trying to save them, other than the drug addict woman, who happened to look out her train window. The movie ends, with the man wandering a new city, and meets a woman, holding a small baby. Other relevant narratives run in parallel, namely one of the female drug-addict, and they all meet at the climax of this tumultuous film.

Founded in 1908, it continues to host open lectures and discussions in the Greater Boston area. Some of the more well-known past speakers include Maya Angelou, Isaac Asimov, Noam Chomsky, Alan Dershowitz, W. E. B. Du Bois, Al Gore, Martin Luther King Jr., Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, Ayn Rand, Cokie Roberts, Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Frost, Malcolm X, Jimmy Wales, and Gwen Ifill. The Ford Hall Forum's mission is \\"to promote freedom of speech and foster an informed and engaged citizenry through the free public presentation of lectures, debates, and discussions.\\" Its events strive to illuminate key issues facing society by bringing to a public podium knowledgeable and thought-provoking speakers. These speakers are presented in person, for free, and in settings that facilitate frank and open debate. All programs provide equal time for speakers' remarks and questions from the audience. History The Forum was founded in February 1908 by George W. Coleman, a Boston businessman and then leader of the Boston Baptist Social Union. The first public lectures were held in the Union's meeting place, the Ford Building on Beacon Hill, from where the Forum's name originates. As a free speech institution that does not endorse the view of any of its speakers, the Forum has occasionally given a stage to speakers who other institutions would, or could, not. In 1929, Margaret Sanger appeared at the Forum, visibly gagged, after Mayor James Michael Curley issued an injunction barring her from speaking about family planning. Around the same time, the Forum withstood criticism for hosting meetings with civil rights activist, W.E.B. Du Bois. Malcolm X was invited to speak in the 1960s at a time when he was widely considered too dangerous to be given a public podium in the heart of Boston. In the early 1990s, when former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was a candidate for a seat in the U.S. Senate, the Forum brought him to Boston to answer questions about his views and about his past. Ousted by the Boston Baptist Social Union for fear of being associated with radicalism, the Ford Hall Forum began its own separate enterprise in 1929. The stated purpose of the new corporation was: \\"To provide education such as will develop intelligent, capable, and responsible citizens, minister to the welfare of all, and promote understanding of civic, moral, religious, and spiritual responsibilities. This can be done in part by maintaining a common meeting ground for all the people where there will be full, free, and open public discussion of all vital questions affecting human welfare.\\" Periodically, the Forum specifically recognizes the value of expressing sentiment that may not always be welcomed but is certainly necessary with its First Amendment Award in honor of Louis P. and Evelyn Smith, long time active benefactors of the Forum. Recipients are listed below along with other speakers. For many years the Ford Hall Forum was based at Northeastern University, the Ford Hall Forum currently is presenting its lecture series in cooperation with Suffolk University.

During the era of slavery in the United States, the education of enslaved African Americans, except for religious instruction, was discouraged, and eventually made illegal in most of the Southern states. After 1831 (the revolt of Nat Turner), the prohibition was extended in some states to free Blacks as well. Slave owners saw literacy as a threat to the institution of slavery and their financial investment in it; as a North Carolina statute stated, \\"'Teaching slaves to read and write, tends to excite dissatisfaction in their minds, and to produce insurrection and rebellion.\\" First, literacy enabled the enslaved to read the widely- distributed writings of abolitionists, who informed readers about the slave revolution in Haiti of 1791‚Äì1804 and the end of slavery in the British Empire in 1833. It also allowed slaves to discover that thousands of the enslaved had escaped, often with the assistance of the Underground Railroad, to safe refuges in the Northern states and Canada. Finally, literacy was believed to make the enslaved unhappy at best, insolent and sullen at worst. As put by prominent Washington lawyer Elias B. Caldwell: Nonetheless, both free and enslaved African Americans continued to learn to read as a result of the sometimes clandestine efforts of free African Americans, sympathetic whites, and informal schools that operated furtively during this period. In addition, slaves used storytelling, music, and crafts to pass along cultural traditions and other information. In the Northern states, African Americans sometimes had access to formal schooling, and were more likely to have basic reading and writing skills. The Quakers were important in establishing education programs in the North in the years before and after the Revolutionary War. During the U.S. colonial period, two prominent religious groups, Congregationalists and Anglicans, both saw the conversion of slaves as a spiritual obligation, and the ability to read scriptures was seen as part of this process (Monoghan, 2001). The Great Awakening served as a catalyst for encouraging education for all members of society. While reading was encouraged in religious instruction, writing often was not. Writing was seen as a mark of status, unnecessary for many members of society, including slaves. This is due to the fact that many had to learn how to read to be able to write. Runaway Wallace Turnage \\"learnt\\" how to read and write \\"during that time [of his enslavement] and since [he] escaped the clutches of those held who held [him] in slavery.\\" It is believed that he learned with the help of the slaves who helped him escape to different sites: for example, someone may have taught him how to read directions to get to the next town. Memorization, catechisms, and scripture formed the basis of what education was available. Despite the lack of importance generally given to writing instruction, there were some notable exceptions; perhaps the most famous of these was Phillis Wheatley, whose poetry won admiration on both sides of the Atlantic. The end of slavery and, with it, the legal prohibition of slave education did not mean that education for former slaves or their descendants became widely available. Racial segregation in schools, de jure and then de facto, and inadequate funding of schools for African Americans, if they existed at all, continued into the later twentieth century and continues in many areas. Legislation and prohibitions Illustration of black students excluded from school, 1839 South Carolina passed the first laws prohibiting slave education in 1740. While there were no limitations on reading or drawing, it became illegal to teach slaves to write. This legislation followed the 1739 Stono Rebellion. As fears proliferated among plantation owners concerning the spread of abolitionist materials, forged passes, and other incendiary writings, the perceived need to restrict slaves‚Äô ability to communicate with one another became more pronounced. For this reason, the State Assembly enacted the following: \\"Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Person and Persons whatsoever, who shall hereafter teach or cause any Slave to be taught to write, or shall use to employ any slave as a Scribe in any Manner of Writing whatsoever, hereafter taught to write, every such offense forfeit the Sum of One Hundred Pounds current Money.\\" While the law does not clarify any consequences for the slaves who might attain this more highly prized form of literacy, the financial consequences for teachers are clear. In 1759, Georgia modeled its own ban on teaching slaves to write after South Carolina's earlier legislation. Again, reading was not prohibited. Throughout the colonial era, reading instruction was tied to the spread of Christianity, so it did not suffer from restrictive legislation until much later.(Monaghan, p. 243) The most oppressive limits on slave education were a reaction to Nat Turner's Revolt in Southampton County, Virginia, during the summer of 1831. This event not only caused shock waves across the slave-holding South, but it had a particularly far-reaching impact on education over the next three decades. The fears of slave insurrections and the spread of abolitionist material and ideology led to radical restrictions on gatherings, travel, and‚Äîof course‚Äîliteracy. The ignorance of the slaves was considered necessary to the security of the evil slaveholders.(Albanese, 1976) Not only did owners fear the spread of specifically abolitionist materials, they did not want slaves to question their authority; thus, reading and reflection were to be prevented at any cost. Each state responded differently to the Turner insurrection. Virginians \\"immediately, as an act of retaliation or vengeance, abolished every colored school within their borders; and having dispersed the pupils, ordered the teachers to leave the State forthwith, and never more to return.\\" While Mississippi already had laws designed to prevent slave literacy, in 1841 the state legislature passed a law that required all free African Americans to leave the state so that they would not be able to educate or incite the slave population. Other states, such as South Carolina, followed suit. The same legislation required that any black preacher would have to be given permission to speak before appearing in front of a congregation. Delaware passed in 1831 a law that prevented the meeting of a dozen or more blacks late at night; additionally, black preachers were to petition a judge or justice of the peace before speaking before any assembly. While states like South Carolina and Georgia had not developed legislation that prohibited education for slaves, other more moderate states responded directly to the 1821 revolt. In 1833, Alabama enacted a law that fined anyone who undertook a slave's education between $250 and $550; the law also prohibited any assembly of African Americans‚Äîslave or free‚Äîunless five slave owners were present or an African-American preacher had previously been licensed by an approved denomination. Even North Carolina, which had previously allowed free African-American children to attend schools alongside whites, eventually responded to fears of insurrection. By 1836, the public education of all African Americans was strictly prohibited. Education and subversion in the Antebellum Era Man-reading-Emancipation-Proclamation-1863 In examining the educational practices of the period, it is difficult to ascertain absolute figures or numbers. However, Genovese (1986) has explored some of these areas and offers some interesting insights. W. E. B. Du Bois and other contemporaries estimated that by 1865 as many as 9% of slaves attained at least a marginal degree of literacy. Genovese comments: \\"this is entirely plausible and may even be too low\\" (p. 562). Especially in cities and sizable towns, many free blacks and literate slaves had greater opportunities to teach others, and both white and black activists operated illegal schools in cities such as Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Charleston, Richmond, and Atlanta. Some notable educators included: * John Berry Meachum, a black pastor, who created a Floating Freedom School on the Mississippi River to circumvent anti-literacy laws. James Milton Turner attended his school. * Margaret Crittendon Douglass, a white woman who published a memoir after she was imprisoned in Virginia for teaching free black children to read. * Catherine and Jane Deveaux, a black mother and daughter who, with the Catholic nun Mathilda Beasley, ran underground schools in Savannah, Georgia.Mary Ellen Snodgrass, Civil Disobedience: An Encyclopedic History of Dissidence in the United States Routledge, Apr 8, 2015, p. 105 Even on plantations, the regular practice of hiring out slaves helped spread literacy. As seen in Frederick Douglass's own narrative, it was common for the literate to share their learning. As a result of the constant flux, few if any plantations would fail to have at least a few literate slaves. Fredrick Douglass states in his biography that he understood the pathway from slavery to freedom and it was to have the power to read and write. In contrast, Schiller wrote: \\"After all, most educated slaves did not find that the acquisition of literacy led inexorably and inevitably to physical freedom and the idea that they needed an education to achieve and experience existential freedoms is surely problematic.\\" Enslaved people taught each other how to read and write As early as the 1710s slaves were receiving Biblical literacy from their masters. Enslaved writer Phillis Wheatley was taught in the home of her master. She ended up using her skills to write poetry and address leaders of government on her feelings about slavery (although she died in abject poverty and obscurity). Not everyone was lucky enough to have the opportunities Wheatley had. Many slaves did learn to read through Christian instruction, but only those whose owners allowed them to attend. Some slave owners would only encourage literacy for slaves because they needed someone to run errands for them and other small reasons. They did not encourage slaves to learn to write. Slave owners saw writing as something that only educated white men should know. African-American preachers would often attempt to teach some of the slaves to read in secret, but there were very few opportunities for concentrated periods of instruction. Through spirituals, stories, and other forms of oral literacy, preachers, abolitionists, and other community leaders imparted valuable political, cultural, and religious information. There is evidence of slaves practicing reading and writing in secret. Slates were discovered near George Washington's estate in Mount Vernon with writings carved in them. Bly noted that \\"237 unidentified slates, 27 pencil leads, 2 pencil slates, and 18 writing slates were uncovered in houses once occupied by Jefferson's black bond servants.\\" This shows that slaves were secretly practicing their reading and writing skills when they had time alone, most likely at night. They also believe slaves practiced their letters in the dirt because it was much easier to hide than writing on slates. Slaves then passed on their newly-learned skills to others. Even though mistresses were more likely than masters to ignore the law and teach slaves to read, children were by far the most likely to flout what they saw as unfair and unnecessary restrictions. While peer tutelage was limited in scope, it was common for slave children to carry the white children's books to school. Once there, they would sit outside and try to follow the lessons through the open windows. Free black schools Isaac and Rosa, formerly enslaved students at the Louisiana Free School In the 1780s a group called the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery (PAS) took on anti-slavery tasks. They helped former slaves with educational and economic aid. They also helped with legal obligations, like making sure they didn't get sold back into slavery. Another anti-slavery group, called the New York Manumission Society (NYMS), did many things towards the abolition of slavery; one important thing they did was establish a school for free blacks. ‚ÄúThe NYMS established the African Free School in 1787 that, during its first two decades of existence, enrolled between 100 and 200 students annually, registering a total of eight hundred pupils by 1822.‚Äù The PAS also instituted a few schools for the free blacks and also had them run only by freed African Americans. They were taught reading, writing, grammar, math, and geography. The schools would have an annual Examination Day to show the public, parents, and donors the knowledge the students had gained. It mainly was to show the white population that African Americans could function in society. There are some surviving records of what they learned in the free schools. Some of the work showed that they were preparing the students for a middle-class standing in society. Founded in 1787, the African Free School provided education for blacks in New York City for more than six decades. In 1863, an image of two emancipated slave children, Isaac and Rosa, who were studying at the Free School of Louisiana, was widely circulated in abolitionist campaigns. References *Albanese, Anthony.

Described as America's \\"first specialist marine engineers\\",Dawson, Andrew (2004): Lives of the Philadelphia Engineers: Capital, Class, and Revolution, 1830‚Äì1890, Ashgate Publishing, p. 36. . Neafie & Levy was probably the first company in the United States to combine the building of iron ships with the manufacture of steam engines to power them.Tyler, p.7. The company was also the largest supplier of screw propellers to other North American shipbuilding firms in its early years, and at its peak in the early 1870s was Philadelphia's busiest and most heavily capitalized shipbuilder. Following the death of one of its proprietors, John P. Levy, in 1867, the company grew more conservative and eventually became a \\"niche\\" shipbuilder of smaller high quality vessels such as steam yachts and tugs. A few years after the retirement and death of its founder and longstanding manager Jacob Neafie in 1898, the company folded through a combination of indifferent management, bad publicity and unprofitable US Navy contracts. Neafie & Levy's 1907 ferry , seen here in its heyday, is still operational today Amongst the more notable vessels built by the company were the US Navy's first submarine, in 1862, and the Navy's first destroyer, , in 1902.USS Bainbridge (DD-1), Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. Several of its vessels, such as the tugboats and and the ferry , are still operational today more than a hundred years after first entering service. In all, the company built more than 300 ships and 1,100 marine steam engines during the course of its 63-year history,Heinrich, p. 151. in addition to its non-marine manufactures, which included refrigeration and sugar refining equipment. Early years The dominant figure in the company for most of its existence was Jacob G. Neafie. Born in New Jersey on Christmas Day 1815, Neafie served his apprenticeship as a machinist in New York before joining the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania shipbuilding firm of Thomas Holloway in 1832, where he gained experience in shipbuilding and reportedly took an interest in the new technology of screw propulsion. After leaving Holloway to establish his own small business in 1838, Neafie joined with two other Philadelphian mechanics, Thomas Reaney and William Smith, to found the firm of Reaney, Neafie & Smith in 1844. The partners quickly established a plant on of waterfront property along the Delaware River, and named the new plant the Penn Steam Engine and Boiler Works (thus giving the company its most often used alternative name, Penn Works). Though originally established to build \\"fire engines, boilers and stationary steam engines\\",Heinrich p. 19. the firm quickly added shipbuilding, constructing its first vessel, the 65-ton steamboat Conestoga, in its first year of operation, and the 99-ton Barclay the following year.Tyler, p. 7. That same year, Smith died, and a new partner, Captain John P. Levy, joined the firm, which was then renamed Reaney, Neafie & Levy. Levy, a wealthy man with connections in government and industry, was an important addition to the company. His most significant early contribution was to persuade a local Philadelphian inventor and steamboat operator, Richard Loper, to license his patent for a unique type of curved propeller, and Reaney, Neafie & Levy were soon to acquire a reputation as specialist propeller makers. In 1859, Thomas Reaney left the firm to establish his own shipbuilding company, Reaney & Son (later Reaney, Son & Archbold), and Reaney, Neafie & Levy became Neafie, Levy & Co..Heinrich, pp. 19‚Äì20. Innovation and leadership, 1850‚Äì1870 Through the 1840s, Neafie & Levy was primarily a manufacturer and supplier of marine steam engines and screw propellers to builders of wooden ships, such as Birely, Hillman & Streaker and William Cramp & Sons. In the early 1850s however, Neafie & Levy began to experiment with iron shipbuilding as a corollary to its propeller-making business. The screw propeller had a number of advantages over the paddlewheel, but it also had disadvantages. Amongst these were the vibration levels caused by higher RPM propeller engines, which loosened bolts on wooden ships, and the tendency for propeller shafts to break due to the phenomenon of \\"hogging\\" ‚Äî the slight flexing of a ship's hull as waves pass beneath it. Since iron vessels were stronger and less prone to hogging, and were also less affected by vibration, it made sense to combine propeller technology with iron hulls. Neafie & Levy built its first iron ship in 1855. By 1860, it had become one of America's leading iron shipbuilding firms, with assets of $300,000, annual output of $368,000, and a workforce of 300.Heinrich p. 20. It had also become America's largest supplier of screw propellers, which grew to be so popular with the shipping firms on North America's Great Lakes that the company's curved propeller was dubbed the \\"Philadelphia wheel\\".Neafie & Levy, Navy and Marine Living History Association, reprinted from United States Mercantile Guide: Leading Pursuits & Leading Men by Edwin T. Freedley, ed. (Edward Young, Philadelphia, 1856), pp. 294‚Äì295. The Civil War The American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) was an economic boom period for American shipbuilders. Over the course of the war, the U.S. Navy requisitioned more than a million tons of shipping from commercial companies, and those companies were then obliged to return to the shipbuilding industry to replace the ships sold to the Navy. In addition, the Navy itself placed contracts with shipbuilders for the construction of warships and other tonnage, such as supply ships and troop transports, sparking a speculative boom in which private firms placed more shipping contracts in hopes of selling them to the government at inflated wartime prices. Neafie & Levy's experience with the Navy though, was to be less than agreeable. The company had supplied the engines for just prior to the war but the Navy Department was dissatisfied with the engine's performance and refused to make full payment, prompting Jacob Neafie to vow never to take another Navy contract. Apart from the construction of the experimental submarine in 1861, Neafie stuck to his vow and repudiated Navy contracts for the remainder of the war. His company still benefited from the boom in commercial shipping however, and made a substantial contribution to the war effort, supplying more than 120 engines for warships and other government vessels built at other yards.Neafie & Levy, Navy and Marine Living History Association, reprinted from The Neafie & Levy Ship and Engine Building Company (Penn Works), published by Ulysses Grant Duffield, New York (Franklin Printing Co., Philadelphia, 1896), pp. 4‚Äì9. At its wartime peak, the company employed 800 workers.Heinrich, p. 28. =Submarine Alligator= Contemporary artist's impression of USS Alligator In the autumn of 1861, the Navy asked Neafie and Levy to construct a small submersible designed by the French engineer Brutus DeVilleroi, who was prepared to act as a supervisor during construction. The vessel was designed with a special airlock through which a diver could attach mines to a ship's hull, and was intended for use against the Confederate ironclad , for which the U.S. Navy had no defense. The contract with Neafie & Levy was signed in November 1861, and the submersible was expected to be completed within forty days, but difficulties with the design along with the departure of DeVilleroi delayed the ship's delivery by about six months, by which time the submersible's original purpose had been obviated. The Navy then attempted to use the submersible, now named Alligator, for another mission off Charleston, South Carolina, but while being towed there it sank during a storm on the night of 2 April 1863. Alligator however, retains the distinction of being the first submarine to see service with the US Navy.Story of the Alligator, Navy and Marine Living History Association.Miles, Jim (2000): Forged in Fire: A History and Tour Guide of the War in the East, From Manassas to Antietam, 1861‚Äì1862, Cumberland House Publishing, , p. 132. Postwar slump and recovery In 1865, the Civil War came to an end with the Union victory, and the wartime conditions that had created a shipbuilding boom now gave way to a corresponding slump. The Navy conducted an auction of hundreds of unwanted ships, flooding the market and leaving shipyards with no work. Decline in the need for domestic shipping caused by the extension of railroads to the South, along with the growing economic independence of the West, also contributed to the shipbuilding recession. The immediate response of Neafie & Levy, as at many other shipyards, was to slash its workforce to the bone. It then joined with William Cramp & Sons in 1866 to create a small subsidiary ferryboat company, for the operation of which Cramp built a ferry called Shackamaxon, while Neafie & Levy supplied the engines. The company's only other work in this period was for the production of a few towboats and some ship repair work. In 1867, Neafie & Levy suffered a major setback with the death of John P. Levy, whose management position was then filled by his heir Edmund L. Levy. With John Levy's death, the company appears to have lost much of its original dynamism, as Jacob Neafie's caution and conservatism increasingly became the dominant factor in its management. This decline would not become evident for some years however. By 1870 the slump had come to an end, and the years 1870‚Äì1871 were amongst Neafie & Levy's most productive. In this two-year period, Neafie & Levy was Philadelphia's busiest shipyard, building 27 vessels and supplying the engines for many others, including those for the 1,200-ton Cramp steamer Clyde, built for the Clyde Line.Heinrich, pp. 50‚Äì54. Conservatism, 1870‚Äì1880s The year 1871 however, also brought developments which signaled Neafie & Levy's eventual departure from the front rank of American shipbuilders. In this year, Cramp & Sons built its first marine engine, and henceforth was to purchase no more engines from Neafie & Levy, depriving the latter of a principal customer. Moreover, Cramp constructed a large dry dock which enabled it to enter the lucrative hull repair business. Jacob Neafie did not follow suit, preferring to rely upon his existing business model of building smaller iron vessels and supplying engines to builders of wooden ships. By 1880, although Neafie & Levy was still Philadelphia's most heavily capitalized firm with a million dollars in assets, its return on investment (ROI) was only 7.1% compared to that of Cramp with an ROI in excess of 15%. Moreover, Cramp's capitalization was not far behind at $750,000, but it employed 2,300 workers compared to Neafie & Levy's 500, and its output was more than 2¬Ω times greater. A substantial part of the difference was due to the Cramp dry dock.Heinrich, pp. 53‚Äì54, 74‚Äì75. 1870s slump and 1880s recovery 1873 marked another prolonged downturn in the industry, triggered by the 1873 financial panic. All American shipyards struggled, and the nadir for Neafie & Levy came in 1877, when not a single ship was launched. To keep their businesses solvent, shipyards at this time diversified into other areas‚Äîin Neafie & Levy's case, into the manufacture of refrigeration equipment. Shipyards also petitioned the government for Navy contracts, and Neafie & Levy was able to secure a modest $35,000 for Navy ship repairs in these years, which included the completion of the gunboat .Heinrich, pp. 70‚Äì71. The slump in the shipbuilding industry finally came to an end in 1880, when new ship orders, generated by demand for foreign produce such as sugar, wool and coffee, began to arrive. Neafie & Levy contracted for freighters and tugs, in particular for the wooden steamships Maracaibo and Fortuano for the Red D Line's Venezuelan coffee imports. Reconstruction of the American South following the Civil War was also creating new demand, and in the same year Neafie & Levy also contracted for the Clyde steamer Delaware for the southern cotton trade. Further contracts came in the 1880s with the patronage of Philadelphia's Lewis Luckenbach Towing Company, which needed barges and powerful tugboats for its novel transport method of tandem barge towing, and which contracted with Neafie & Levy for such vessels as the 200-ton tugboat Ocean King, built in 1884. Demand for vessels in the early 1880s was strong enough to motivate shipyards to upgrade their facilities, although once again Neafie & Levy chose to make only modest improvements. In 1882, the company booked orders for five small iron vessels and built engines for another fifteen wooden steamers. Demand was also driving the creation of new shipbuilding companies, such as the short-lived American Shipbuilding Company, which subcontracted vessels to Neafie & Levy including the 2,728-gross-register-ton steamer Chatham and the collier Frostburg.Heinrich, pp. 77‚Äì84. 1883 strike and aftermath In 1883, more than 500 ships' carpenters walked out of shipyards in Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey in an attempt to gain a wage increase. They failed to shut down the yards however, since they had not invited metal tradesmen to join the strike. The proprietors of the shipyards resolved to act in unison against the strikers, and did so by introducing strikebreakers and declaring an end to the closed shop system. After seven weeks of bitter standoff, the strikers were forced to return to work under the new open shop system, a system that would prevail until World War I. By 1884 the brief upturn in shipbuilding was over, and the industry experienced another slump. Shipping companies responded, as always, by slashing their workforce ‚Äî Cramp from 1,800 to 800 men, and Neafie & Levy from 300 to just 50.Heinrich, p. 93. A niche shipbuilder, 1880s‚Äì1890s J. P. Morgan's spectacular yacht Corsair, built by Neafie & Levy in 1890 In the latter half of the 1880s, the larger shipyards turned to government contracts for assistance in weathering the slump, while the government itself was keen to expand the Navy. Smaller Philadelphia shipyards like Neafie & Levy, however‚Äîmindful both of the rigorous conditions placed on Navy contracts, and of the recent example of an established shipyard bankrupted by such a contract‚Äîpreferred other solutions. Neafie & Levy refused to bid for Navy contracts in 1886‚Äì1887, relying instead on private contracts for smaller vessels of under 1,500 tons‚Äîsuch as yachts, tugs, ferries and barges‚Äîdemand for which had begun to increase after 1887. Between 1888 and 1893, Neafie & Levy built 28 small iron steamships and thirty engines for larger vessels built at other yards. Its major customers included the New York, Lake Erie & Western Railroad, which required tugs and ferryboats for the expansion of its harbor service fleet. In addition, Neafie & Levy built some small warships and sugar-processing equipment for South American customers, a niche the company had filled since the 1870s. Business was solid enough for the company to invest in further expansion of its plant, with new offices, drafting rooms and workshops. To help pay for this expansion, the company went public, and formally became the Neafie & Levy Ship and Engine Building Company. The proprietors however, retained the majority of shares and thus control of the business. The most spectacular vessel built by the company in this period was the steam yacht Corsair II for the millionaire businessman J. Pierpont Morgan. Designed by Morgan's friend J. Frederic Tams who was told to spare no expense, the lavishly outfitted vessel was the world's largest pleasure ship upon launch in 1890.Heinrich, pp. 102, 105, 139. Naval contracts and bankruptcy, 1900s USS St. Louis off Boston, 1917 In 1898, Jacob Neafie, who had successfully steered his company through the most turbulent half-century in American shipbuilding history, retired from the business at the age of 82 and died a few days later. His will assigned the business to a trustee, a real estate broker with little shipbuilding experience named Matthias Seddinger, who was to manage the estate on behalf of Neafie's daughter Mary. Seddinger, now the firm's nominal President, passed managerial control to the new vice president of the company, a marine engineer named Sommers N. Smith. Repudiating Jacob Neafie's longstanding avoidance of Naval contracts, Smith soon booked contracts for three US Navy destroyers‚Äîthe Navy's first vessels of the type‚Äî, and . He also booked contracts for the protected cruisers and . Smith quickly ran into trouble with the new Navy contracts. Firstly, his bid of $374,000 per ship for the three destroyers proved too low. Delays in delivery of specialty steel for the ships meant postponement of Navy payments which were made on a milestone basis. Furthermore, the Navy design proved too ambitious, as the ships' hulls were too light to absorb vibrations caused by the powerful engines. As a result, USS Bainbridge was subjected to more Navy trials than any other warship, and by the time the vessels were finally delivered in 1902, Smith had lost a total of $180,000 on the three destroyer contracts. Similarly, delays in steel delivery for USS St. Louis resulted in deferments of payment by the Navy, forcing Smith to obtain loans to pay for the ship's completion. At around the same time, a boiler exploded on a ship recently completed by the company, the river steamer City of Trenton, killing 24 passengers in one of the Delaware River's worst accidents.Tyler, p. 99. Relatives of the passengers sued, and though the company was eventually exonerated, its reputation was harmed in the meantime and business slowed. By November 1903 the company was unable to service its debts. Initially, a group of benevolent creditors placed the company into receivership, believing it just needed some time to trade its way out of difficulty. Unfortunately, the group appointed Sommers N. Smith himself as receiver, and when it was discovered that Seddinger and Smith had awarded themselves a large dividend out of capital in the midst of the company's troubles, as well as engaging in fraudulent bookkeeping, the remaining creditors' confidence was shaken. Seddinger and Smith were removed from their positions, and a more competent receiver appointed, but the latter was unable to persuade the creditors to make the necessary investments to revive the company's fortunes, and in May 1908 the Neafie & Levy plant was sold for the sum of only $50,000. The company's last vessel, the steel tug Adriatic, was delivered in September 1908, after which the new owners discontinued shipbuilding operations.Heinrich, pp. 148‚Äì151. Fate of the shipyard Following the delivery of Adriatic, wreckers tore down the shipyard's buildings and dismantled the ship's berths, and the premises was sold to the Immigration Service, which erected a quarantine station in its place. In 1920, the site was resold to the Philadelphia Electric Company, which built the Delaware Power Station there. The power station operated until 2004 when it was shut down. The present owners, Exelon Corporation, have said they currently have no plans for the site, but are retaining it in hopes of one day returning it to electricity generation.How the Excelon (sic) Delaware power plant came to be, PlanPhilly website. Recently developers are planning to develop the old power plant, with a boutique hotel and event space.

He became known as \\"Sheikh of the Sect (Shaikh al-Ta'ifah),\\" authored two of the four main Shi'i books of hadith, Tahdhib al-Ahkam and al- Istibsar, and is believed to have founded the Najaf Hawza. He also counts as the founder of Shia jurisprudence. Life=Birth Abu Ja øfar Muhammad b. al-Hasan b.  øAli b. al-Hasan al-Tusi was born in Tus in Persia in the year 995 AD/385 of the Islamic era. Middle years Al-Shaikh ali-Tusi grew up in Tus and began his studies there. In 1018 AD/408 A.H. he left Tus to study in Baghdad. There he first studied under al-Shaikh al-Mufid, who died in 1022 AD/413 A.H. Leadership of the Shi'ite scholars then fell to al-Sharif al- Murtada. The latter remained in this position until his death in 1045 AD/436 A.H. During this time al-Shaikh al-Tusi was closely associated with al-Sharif al-Murtada. His vast scholarship and learning made him a natural successor of al-Sharif al-Murtada as the leading spokesman of Shi'ite Islam. So impressive was his learning that the Abbasid caliph, al-Qadir, attended his lectures and sought to honour him. In the closing years of al-Shaikh al-Tusi's life the political situation in Baghdad and the domains of the Abbasid caliphate was in turmoil. The Saljuqids fiercely anti-Shia, were gaining commanding power in the centre of the Islamic Empire at the expense of the Buyids who had always seemed tolerant to Shi'ite views. In 1055 AD/447 A.H Tughril-bek the leaders of the Saljuqids entered Baghdad. At this time many of the 'ulama' in Baghdad, both Sunni and Shi øite were killed. The house of al-Shaikh al-Tusi was burnt down, as were his books and the works he had written in Baghdad, together with important libraries of Shi'ite books. Fanaticism against the Shi'a was great. Death Al-Shaikh al-Tusi, seeing the danger of remaining in Baghdad, left and went to al-Najaf. Al-Najaf, the city where 'Ali b. Abi Talib is buried, was already a very important city in the hearts of Shi'ite Muslims. However, it was al-Shaikh al-Tusi's arrival which was to give that city the impetus to become the leading centre of Shi'ite scholarship. This is a role, which it has maintained down to the present day. Al-Shaikh al-Tusi died in al-Najaf on the 22nd of Muharram in the year 460 A.H/2 December 1067. His body was buried in a house there, which was made into a mosque as he had enjoined in his will. Al- Tusi was succeeded by his son al-Hasan, who was known as al-Mufid al-Thani, and was himself considered an outstanding scholar. Ideas After completing his preliminary studies, in 408/1017 he left Khorasan, fundamentally Shafi'i and to an increasing degree controlled by the GÃ≤hÃ≤aznawid Ma·∏•m≈´d, in favour of Baghdad, where the Shia Buwayhids were dominant. There, he studied under leading ImƒÅmƒ´ masters including Abu  æl-·∏§asan Ibn Abƒ´ ·∏éjÃ≤≈´d, A·∏•mad b. Mu·∏•ammad b. M≈´sƒÅ al-AhwƒÅzƒ´, al-GÃ≤hÃ≤adÃìƒÅ æirƒ´, Ibn  øAbd≈´n, and, in particular, the powerful doyen of ImƒÅmƒ´ rationalists permeated by Mu øtazilƒ´ dialectic, al-SÃ≤hÃ≤aykÃ≤hÃ≤ al-Mufƒ´d [q.v.], of whom hequickly became, in spite of his youth, one of the favourite pupils (on the rationalist evolution of ImƒÅmism, see Amir Moezzi, 1992, 15-48). On the deathof al-Mufƒ´d in 413/1022, his disciple al-SÃ≤hÃ≤arƒ´f al-MurtadÃìƒÅ  øAlam al-HudƒÅ [q.v.], who had also studied under the Mu øtazilƒ´  øAbd al-·∏éjÃ≤abbƒÅr [q.v.], took over the leadership of the ImƒÅmƒ´s of the capital. ·π¨≈´sƒ´ subsequently became his principal disciple. Eminent scholars and former pupils of al-Mufƒ´d, such as al-NadÃ≤jÃ≤ƒÅsÃ≤hÃ≤ƒ´, al- KarƒÅdÃ≤jÃ≤akƒ´ or Ab≈´ Ya ølƒÅ al-·∏éjÃ≤a øfarƒ´, were still living in Baghdad, but on the death of al-MurtadÃìƒÅ in 436/1044 he was succeeded by ·π¨≈´sƒ´. In fact, by this time he had already amassed an impressive bibliography and had succeeded in gaining the support of numerous Buwayhids and of the caliph ·∏≤ƒÅ æim (422-67/1031-75), who appointed him to the principal chair of theology, the most prestigious of the capital. Heir to a substantial proportion of the great ImƒÅmƒ´ libraries of the time, that of the dƒÅr al- øilm founded by SƒÅb≈´r b. ArdasÃ≤hÃ≤ƒ´r (more than 100,000 works) and that of al-MurtadÃìƒÅ (almost 80,000 works), ·π¨≈´sƒ´ composed some fifty books and his house, in the Shia quarter of KarkÃ≤hÃ≤ [q.v.], became for a period of more than ten years the virtual intellectual centre of ImƒÅmism. Under the Buwayhids, numerous religious riots had caused bloodshed in the capital. In 447-8/1056-7, ¬∂ after the al-BasƒÅsƒ´rƒ´ episode, the invasion of BagÃ≤hÃ≤dƒÅd by the SaldÃ≤jÃ≤≈´·∏≥·π¨ogÃ≤hÃ≤riÃäl and the end of the Buwayhids, the anti-Shia coalition, led by Hanbali traditionalists, sacked the quarters of KarkÃ≤hÃ≤ and of BƒÅb al-·π¨ƒÅ·∏≥. Al-·π¨≈´sƒ´‚Äôs home and library were burnt and he himself took refuge in Najaf. There he remained until his death, continuing to teach a limited circle of disciples, including his own son Ab≈´  øAlƒ´ al-·∏§asan who succeeded him. Also worthy of mention among his disciples were SulaymƒÅn al-·π¢ahrasÃ≤hÃ≤tƒ´, al-·∏§asan b. al-·∏§usayn b. BƒÅbawayh (nephew of Ibn BƒÅbawayh al-·π¢ad≈´·∏≥), Is·∏•ƒÅ·∏≥b. Mu·∏•ammad al-·∏≤ummƒ´ (grandson of al-·π¢ad≈´·∏≥), SÃ≤hÃ≤ahrƒÅsÃ≤hÃ≤≈´b al-MƒÅzandarƒÅnƒ´ (grandfather of the famous author of the ManƒÅ·∏≥ib ) and also al-FattƒÅl al-Nƒ´sƒÅb≈´rƒ´. In his work, ·π¨≈´sƒ´ attempts to modify the radically rationalist and pragmatic positions of al-MurtadÃìƒÅ (positions already present in embryonic form in the work of al-Mufid): rehabilitation of the first traditionists, ilm-ul-hadith attested by a single authority so long as these are conveyed by reliable sources and conditional validity of traditions conveyed by transmitters professing ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù doctrines. In politics, serving an unlawful government (in this instance, the  øAbbƒÅsid caliphate) is in certain circumstances desirable, and collaboration with a power claiming that its authority derives from the Hidden ImƒÅm (a clear reference to the Buwayhids) can be commendable, but neither the one nor the other is ever obligatory (as was apparently advocated by al-MurtadÃìƒÅ). At the same time, ·π¨≈´sƒ´ has constant recourse to reasoned argumentation based on idÃ≤jÃ≤tihƒÅd and he begins to sketch the notion of the ‚Äúgeneral representation‚Äù (al-niyƒÅba al- øƒÅmma) of the Hidden ImƒÅm entrusted to jurist-theologians who may, if the need arises, exercise the prerogatives traditionally reserved for the historical ImƒÅms. In completing and modifying the work of al-Mufƒ´d and of al-MurtadÃìƒÅ, ·π¨≈´sƒ´ succeeded in endowing ImƒÅmƒ´ law with a structure and a scope of activity practically independent of the figure of the ImƒÅm. Thus his work was to provide rationalist ImƒÅmism, known from the following century onward as al-u·π£≈´liyya, with solid intellectual bases, enabling it to experience a lengthy evolution which would lead ultimately to an ever-increasing assumption of power by ImƒÅmƒ´ mudÃ≤jÃ≤tahids in the economic, social and political fields. The immense and lasting influence of the work of ·π¨≈´sƒ´ earned him the honorific nickname of SÃ≤hÃ≤aykÃ≤hÃ≤ al-·π¨ƒÅ æifa [al-ImƒÅmiyya] or simply al-SÃ≤hÃ≤aykÃ≤hÃ≤ .

He's the founder of seminary of Najaf. Legacy Al-Tusi was succeeded by his son al-Hasan, who was known as al-Mufid al-Thani, and was himself considered an outstanding scholar. The seminary of Najaf Hawza#Hawza 'Ilmiyya Najaf, founded by Al-Tusi, remains the top Shi'ite theological institute in the world. In Najaf, one of the largest collection of Shi'ite texts exists in a library named after al-Tusi. Online, the largest repository of Shi'ite digital e-books has been also labeled the Sheikh Tusi Digital Library. Both libraries are free for public use. Tusi had important role in formation and revival of Shia jurisprudence and law. since that his time was coincidence with the burning of the great books and library, nearly he must to revive the hadith and jurisprudence in a way. He innovated in the sphere of jurisprudence. He tried to defend the application of jurisprudence in respect of religious laws. One of his accomplishments was that he could be successful in propagation and coherence of methodologies of argumentation and inference. His dominance was unrivaled until long Time. Nearly all jurisprudents only were affected by shaykh Tusi's opinions. The influence of shaykh Tusi continued until the emergence of Ibn Idris Hilli who criticized some views of shaykh Tusi. Also Tusi Had given to shaykh Mufid a definite formulation in Ijtihad. In fact three people including Shaykh Tusi had important role in leadership of Shia's school of law. Some works of Tusi shows that he was influenced by precedent jurists like Sallar Deylami.Al-Shaykh al-·π¨≈´sƒ´: His Writings on Theology and their Reception* Hassan Ansari and Sabine Schmidtke,p.477 Usuli school In confliction between two schools of Akhbari and Usuli, Shaykh Tusi defended of Usuli school and calls akhbari as followers of literate or literalists. Shaykh Tusi believed in principles of jurisprudence as a fundamental knowledge in acquiring the judgments of Islam religion. he wrote in introduction of 'Al-Iddah' book as follow: \\" thus you may say, it is essential to attach the greatest importance to this branch of knowledge (namely Usul) because the whole of shariah is based on it and the knowledge of the any aspect thereof is not complete without mastering the principles. Also he tries to compare different schools of law in Islam with each other and show there is a little divergence between them and they are near to each other and differences among them is in minor subject not major. Shaykh Tusi, like his Masters, refuted the legal analogy(Qiyyas Fiqhi) in his manual of usul Fiqh. Importance of reason His emphasis was on the rational dimension of religion such a way that he know principles like commanding to good and prohibiting of evil as something which is indispensable according to reason. Even shaykh Tusi try to give validity to Consensus(Ijma) according to rational rule of Lutf. according to principle of Lutf, God must provide believers with conditions and situation for doing religious acts and nearing to good.principle of lutf requires the appointment of infallible imam and necessitates that the Imam reveals the truth about any problem on which a wrong agreement may have been reached. Pioneering Tusi was leading in different majors of religious sciences such as Ilm- rijal(Biography),traditions(Hadiths) and Fihrist(Catalogue).He also starts important developments in that allow shia clerics to comprehend some of the roles permitted before only for Imam. these roles are to collecting and distributing the religious taxes and organizing the Friday prayers. Najaf seminary According to some scholars, Sheykh Tusi established the Hawzeh of Najaf after migrating from Baghdad. Works He wrote nearly over fifty works in different Islamic branch of knowledge such as philosophy, hadith, theology, biography,historiography,exegesis and tradition. Of the four authoritative resources of the Shiites, two are written by Shaykh Tusi. These two basic reference books are: Tahdhib al-Ahkam and Al-Istibsar. Both of these pertain to Hadiths of Islamic Jurisprudential decrees and injunctions. *Al-Nihayah *Al-Tibyan Fi Tafsir al-Quran *Al-Istibsar in 4 volumes *Tahdhib Al-osul in two volumes *Oddat Al-osul this book provide us with advantage information about development of Osul Science and this knowledge between Sunnis. *Al- fatawa *Al-Mabsut *Al-Iqtisad Al Hadi Ila Tariq Al Rashad *Al-Ghaybah (Eng. tr. 2011 by Athar Housain S.

By some estimates, the number of emigrants was in tens of thousands in this period. History Traditional ways of life in the Indigenous inhabitants villages in the New Territories collapsed at the end of WWII. Unable to earn a living in the newly industrialised economy of post-war Hong Kong, many villagers exercised their right of abode in the United Kingdom and left for Europe. In 1967, a series of large-scale riots erupted in Hong Kong, causing social instability. These events led some of the richer Hong Kong residents to move abroad. Emigration took place to countries in Southeast Asia, South Africa or South American countries. This wave did not come to a rest until the mid-1970s. On the 19th of December 1984, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom signed the \\"Sino-British Joint Declaration\\", and validated the 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China. The declaration prompted emigration of the Hong Kongers. The British government made it clear that Hong Kong citizens would not be granted British citizenship on the grounds that they were residing in a British colony, so instead, numerous residents sought alternate arrangements and migrated to other countries. The Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 in Beijing triggered mass migration in the 1990s. Canada, Australia, and other Commonwealth realms were the primary destinations for migrants at the time. In particular, popular cities for migrants included Metro Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, and London in the UK. To a lesser extent, other immigrant destinations included San Francisco and New York in the US, as well as several Asian cities including Singapore. At the height of the mass migration wave, some small states like Cape Verde advertised their passport in magazines. Some foreign embassies took bribes for giving out passports, amounting to outright political corruption. Some people had relocated overseas through studying abroad and staying after graduation, while others simply obtained returning residency visa from the destination country, which was issued by some countries with no conditions attached in the late 1980s, and then returned to Hong Kong. Informed estimates range from 250,000 to one million people, with the peak years of outflow between 1988 and 1994 of about 55,000 per year. In 1990, the outflow of people reached a peak of 62,000 people or about 1% of the population. The emigration rate would reach the peak in 1992 with 66,000 people, followed by 53,000 in 1993, and 62,000 in 1994. An estimated US $4.2 billion flowed from Hong Kong to Canada directly as a result.Manion, Melanie. [2004](2004). Corruption by Design: Building Clean Government in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Harvard University press. From 1998, one year after the transfer of sovereignty, some Hong Kong-born emigrants returned to Hong Kong with foreign citizenship. The phenomenon is called \\"È¶ôÊ∏ØÂõûÊµÅÊΩÆ\\" (Hong-Kong returning tidal flow). In 2011, the estimated migration rate reach the peak. In Hong Kong, over 65 percent of Hong Kong permanent residents desired to migrate to others countries, in accordance with the questionnaires originated from Chinese University of Hong Kong. Following the implementation of a new security law on July 1, 2020, one prominent activist fled Hong Kong and sparked speculation that a large wave of emigration was imminent. Said security law has been interpreted by some as a means to persecute individuals for participating in protests. A number of nations have moved to expedite the immigration process and/or grant refugee status to many Hong Kong emigrants, including Australia, Canada, Taiwan, the United Kingdom (which has announced that they will grant UK citizenship to a maximum total of 3 million immigrants from Hong Kong, although details are vague), and the United States.

He remained there and became an authority on Irish antiquities. Some of his theories would be rejected today, but his drawings, for example, were pain-stakingly accurate compared to existent artefacts. Other drawings, such as his diagram of the banquet hall at Tara, and the lost crown of the High King of Ireland, are unverifiable, as the manuscripts and material he used, no longer exist. Early life He was born Charles Vallanc√© in Westminster in 1731 to parents Francis Vallanc√© and Mary Preston (daughter of Thomas Preston). Francis and Mary were married at the chapel of Greenwich Hospital on 21 June 1724. Vallancey attended Eton and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, before being commissioned in the 10th regiment of foot in 1747.Norman Vance, ‚ÄòVallancey, Charles (c.1726‚Äì1812)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004. He was attached to the Royal Engineers, became a lieutenant-general in 1798, and a general in 1803. To Ireland Vallancey came to Ireland before 1770 to assist in a military survey of the island, and made the country his adopted home. His attention was strongly drawn towards the history, philology, and antiquities of Ireland at a time when they were almost entirely ignored, and he published the following, among other works: Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis, 6 vols., between 1770 and 1804; Essay on the Irish Language, 1772; Grammar of the Irish Language, 1773; Vindication of the Ancient Kingdom of Ireland, 1786; Ancient History of Ireland proved from the Sanscrit Books, 1797; Prospectus of a Dictionary of the Aire Coti or Antient Irish, 1802. He was a member of many learned societies, was created an honorary LL.D., and became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1784. During the Insurrection of 1798 he furnished the Government with plans for the defence of Dublin. Queen's-bridge, Dublin, was built from his designs. He died 8 August 1812, aged 81. He at one stage possessed The Great Book of Lecan which he passed on to the Royal Irish Academy In his book, A Vindication of the Ancient History of Ireland(1786) claimed that Zoroaster was none other than Nuada Airgetlam - Nuada of the Silver Hand - a member of Ireland's Tribes of God's - the Tuatha De Dannan. Extract of 1778 report on West Cork  ‚Äòthere was only one road between Cork and Bantry; you may now proceed by eight carriage roads beside several horse tracks branching off from these great roads, from Bantry the country is mountainous and from the high road has the appearance of being barren and very thinly populated; yet the valleys abound with, corn and potatoes and the mountains are covered with black cattle in 1760, twenty years ago it was so thinly inhabited an army of 10,000 men could not possible have found subsistence between Bantry and Bandon. The face of the country now wears a different aspect: the sides of the hill are under the plough, the verges of the bogs are reclaimed and the southern coast from Skibbereen to Bandon is one continued garden of grain and potatoes except the barren pinnacles of some hills and the boggy hollows between which are preserved for fuel‚Äô (Original in British Library) 19th-century reflections In the mid to late nineteenth century, there were portraits of him in the Royal Irish Academy and in the board-room of the Royal Dublin Society. At that same time, research showed that his theories and conclusions‚Äîa fanciful compound of crude deductions from imperfect knowledge‚Äîwere shown to be without value. George Petrie said: \\"It is a difficult and rather unpleasant task to follow a writer so rambling in his reasonings and so obscure in his style; his hypotheses are of a visionary nature.\\" The Quarterly Review declared that: \\"General Vallancey, though a man of learning, wrote more nonsense than any man of his time, and has unfortunately been the occasion of much more than he wrote.\\" The Edinburgh Review says: \\"To expose the continual error of his theory will not cure his inveterate disease. It can only excite hopes of preventing infection by showing that he has reduced that kind of writing to absurdity, and raised a warning monument to all antiquaries and philologians that may succeed him.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Geography of County Cork Category:Royal Lincolnshire Regiment officers Category:British Army generals Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich Category:British surveyors Category:1812 deaths Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:1721 births ","title":"Charles Vallancey"},{"id":"10895370","text":"Harvey Sheldon Rosen (born 29 March 1949) was the John L.

Brown had for years been formulating a plan that he was convinced would end slavery forever ‚Äì a raid on the arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Virginia. This effort was supposed to arm slaves who would in turn hold an armed uprising against their masters. Once free, they would form a community where they could live peacefully. But, before he moved forward with that plan, Brown, Kagi, and the rest of Brown's followers were dealing with anti-slavery efforts in \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". By December 1858, they were at Bain's Fort, having freed an anti-slavery friend from captivity. At the behest of a slave named Jim Daniels, on December 20, 1858, Brown and a group of his men, including Kagi, rode into Vernon County, Missouri from Kansas with the intention of taking Daniels and other slaves from their masters and taking them all the way to Canada to freedom. When they neared their destination they split into two groups. Brown's group set off to free the Daniels family first. Daniels, his pregnant wife, and their two children were owned by the James Lawrence estate and were at the home of Lawrence's son-in-law, Harvey Hicklin, and his wife. At gunpoint, the Daniels family was taken, along with another male slave named Sam Harper. Brown's group then went to the home of Isaac Larue and at gunpoint took several slaves consisting of Sam Harper's mother, little sisters, little brother, and an unrelated male slave. Simultaneously, the group led by Kagi and Colonel Whipple (Aaron Dwight Stevens) raided the home of David Cruise and took a slave named Jane, with Whipple killing Cruise in the process. The two groups met and headed for Kansas with their eleven fugitives. For weeks, the escaping slaves were hidden, receiving aid at various locations in northeast Kansas. Mrs. Daniels gave birth to a son, who was named after John Brown. In early 1859, the group of twelve were led north through Nebraska. In February 1859, they stayed at the cabin of John Kagi's sister, Barbara Mayhew. The group was continually hounded by an armed posse. Despite a posse attempting to take John Kagi at his sister‚Äôs cabin, they made it safely across the river into Iowa and then eventually reached freedom in Windsor, Ontario, Canada on March 12, 1859. The twelve consisted of the eleven slaves plus one child born during the trek, in three families: the Harper family, the Daniels family, and one unrelated male. According to the National Park Service: > The Mayhew Cabin was built in 1855 from hand hewn cottonwood trees and > served as the home of the Mayhew family until 1864, when the cabin and > surrounding property were first sold. The property continued to change hands > through the end of the 19th century until 1937, when owner Edward Bartling > had the cabin moved to prevent its destruction by a highway project.

In addition to restoring the cabin, Bartling had a cave > built underneath the cabin to help interpret the Mayhew family‚Äôs rumored > association with the Underground Railroad. The cave consists of a cellar and > connecting tunnels, sleeping quarters, and a tunnel exiting to a nearby > ravine.

The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of February 18, 2011.  Restoration  In 2005 the Mayhew Cabin was restored and the site began operating as a non-profit foundation. The foundation acquired a new museum space in 2010 just to the west of the Mayhew Cabin. The foundation also maintains on the site an historic Mt. Zion AME Church, one of the first black congregations established west of the Missouri River.

It is a non-profit and non-governmental organization, founded in 1896 to promote and protect publishing and to raise awareness for publishing in the context of economic, cultural and political development. The IPA actively opposes censorship and promotes copyright, literacy and the freedom to publish, and represents the interests of the publishing industry at international level.  History  Founded in 1896 in Paris, France, by the leading publishers at that time the initial aim of the IPA was to ensure that countries throughout the world adopted copyright law and implemented the then new international copyright treaty, the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. The IPA, active mostly in Europe during its first century, provided a platform for national publishers to voice their concerns for future important issues. From its first year, IPA members called to countries to eliminate custom duties to intellectual products, and the tenth Congress in 1933 dealt for the first time with book fairs. In 1962, the IPA‚Äôs headquarters moved from Zurich to Geneva. In the same year, at the Barcelona Congress, regular connections with UNESCO were established. The promotion of copyright remains one of the IPA's main objectives. Since its establishment the IPA also promotes and defends the freedom to publish, which it describes as a \\"fundamental aspect of the human right to freedom of expression. As an industry association IPA continues to deal with a range of issues affecting publishers, such as book fairs, standards, piracy, literacy, textbook procurement policy, collective licensing, VAT, professional training, and promotion of reading. The IPA also functions as a meeting place for publishers to network and conduct business.  Membership  The IPA is a federation of national, regional and specialist publishers' associations. The IPA has more than 60 organisational members from more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and the Americas. It has consultative status as non-governmental organisation at the United Nations.  Committees  * Copyright Committee * Freedom to Publish Committee * Literacy & Book Industry Policy Committee * International Education Publishers Forum  Governing Bodies  The General Assembly is the governing body. The assembly is composed of two representatives of the publishers association from each country; each is allowed a vote in assembly decisions. The assembly meets at least once a year, usually at the Frankfurt Book Fair. The President is elected by the General Assembly and has a term of two years. He or she is the head of the General Assembly and the Executive Committee. The Executive committee formulates plans and policies for the General Assembly to discuss and vote on. The IPA also elects two Vice Presidents and regional representatives. A Secretary General acts as the chief operating officer. The President for 2019-2021 is Hugo Setzer (Manual Moderno, Spain), and the Vice President is Bodour Al Qasimi (Kalimat Group, UAE). The current Secretary General is Jos√© Borghino.\\"About: International Publishers Association\\". International Publishers Association. Retrieved 14 Feb 2019.

Recently, IPA has participated in the WIPO Stakeholder Platform, an initiative to explore the specific needs and concerns of copyright owners and reading-impaired persons. IPA also has regular connections with industry and regulatory organizations. These include national publisher associations, organizations representing special consumer interests, and reproduction rights organizations which essentially collect license fees for rights holders. For example, IPA is an associate member of the International Federation for Reproduction Rights Organizations (IFRRO) and since 2004, represents publisher interests on the IFRRO Board. It is also a member of International Standard organizations EDItEUR and International ISBN Agency.  Congress  IPA organizes a Publishers Congress every four years, starting from 1896 in Paris, France, where publishers fully and openly discuss relevant, basic, and long-term industry problems and challenges.  2008 Publishers Congress, Seoul  The 28th Congress attracted nearly 700 participants form over 45 countries. In its resolution, the Congress expressed the need for reform in the freedom to publish in Burma/Myanmar, China, Iran, and Vietnam, calling for the immediate release of Publishers, writers, journalists and bloggers in prison or under house arrest for having exercised their rights to freedom of expression.\\"28th_IPA_Resolutions\\" federacioneditores.org  Copyright Symposiums  The IPA host a Copyright Symposium every four years. The first Copyright Symposium was held in 1986, Heidelberg, Germany, to mark the centenary of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. The Copyright Symposia are held in partnership with IPA member organisations.  7th Copyright Symposium 2010, Abu Dhabi  From 28 February to 1 March 2010 Abu Dhabi hosted the 7th Copyright Symposium 2010, held for the first time in the Arab world. Attended by 270 delegates from 53 countries, the two-day symposium was attended by government officials, legal experts, publishers and authors. Plenary speeches and seminars covered topics such as copyright and Islamic law, publishing in the internet age, collective licensing, the digital market place, global copyright trends and the future of copyright in emerging markets. The symposium was held immediately before the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair, 2 to 7 March.  Freedom to Publish  One of the IPA's main goals is to protect the right of publishers to produce and distribute the materials they choose to. In other words, to protect their basic human right to freedom of expression. The IPA bases its beliefs on the following human rights standards: *Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights *Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights *Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms The IPA website offers links to many websites dealing with the freedom to publish, such as AAP International's Freedom to Publish Committee, Amnesty International, and the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX). The IPA began working with IFEX in 2004. IFEX was established in 1992 to combat all the offenses that were taking place against freedom of expression. It has 81 member organizations and monitors and reports violations using an Action Alert Network (AAN). This network allows members throughout the world to campaign against violations using tools such as letter writing campaigns, media coverage, and awareness-raising events. Many of the organizations' actions are focused on freeing imprisoned journalists and keeping journalists around the world safe.  Freedom to Publish Freedom Prize  The IPA awards the IPA Freedom to Publish Prize annually since 2005, to honour a person or an organization anywhere in the world that has defended and promoted the freedom publish with courage. It consists of a monetary award and a certificate. The list of past winners is as follows. * 2018 Gui Minhai * 2016 Raif Badawi Saudi Arabia. * 2014 Ihar Lohvinau Belarus. * 2012 Jonathan \\"Zapiro\\" ShapiroInternational Publishers Association (IPA)'s official web page: IPA Freedom to Publish Prize 2012 recipient * 2011 Bui Chat (Giay Vun Publishing, Vietnam) * 2010 Israpil Shovkhalov and Viktor Kogan-Yasny (DOSH Magazine, Chechnya-Russia) Special Award to Irfan Sanci (Sel Yayƒ±ncilik) * 2009 Sihem Bensedrine, Neziha Rjiba and Mohamed Talbi (OLPEC, Tunisia) * 2008 Ragƒ±p Zarakolu (Belge, Turkey) * 2007 Trevor Ncube (Zimbabwe), Special Award to Anna Politkovskaya and Hrant Dink * 2006 Shalah Lahiji (Roshangaran, Iran) 2011 recipient Bui Chat was arrested by Vietnam authorities shortly after his return from Buenos Aires, where he received his prize. Though temporarily released in May, he is still subject to surveillance and further interrogation.  Prohibition of Religious Defamation  In 2008 the IPA adopted a resolution against prohibiting religious defamation, in light of the UN Ad Hoc Committee session on complementary Standards called at the initiative of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Later in 2009 the forum passed a resolution condemning religious defamation as a human rights violation, also noting that ‚ÄúIslam is frequently and wrongly associated with human rights violation and terrorism.‚Äù In a 2010 Press Release, the IPA stated that ‚ÄúHuman Rights protect individual human beings, not institutions or religions. Criticism of religions and religious practices must be allowed, in particular when religions are viewed from a political point of view. As organizations representing writers, artists and journalists of all faiths and none, we warn against any regulations prohibiting criticism of any religion or any set of ideas.‚Äùinternationalpublishers.org  Copyright = Google Books Project  In 2005 IPA issued a joint statement with PEN USA on the Google Books Project. The statement raised concerns that Google is disregarding the rights of authors and is infringing copyright law. In the statement the two organisations asserts the rights of an author to determine whether their work will be available in a digital format. The statement raises the concern that once materials are available digitally it is hard to monitor how many copies are produced, which is an infringement of copyright legislation. The IPA and PEN USA call for Google to obtain author permission before making works available in the Google Print Library Project. They also wish for Google to work more closely with authors to make sure that authors‚Äô rights are not violated.  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)  World Blind Union (WBU) = The IPA collaborates closely with the World Blind Union and other interests of persons with print disabilities. Since 2009 WBU, among other related organizations, and rights holder organizations such as IPA have discussed in the WIPO Stakeholder Platform to discuss without the interference of international organization politics. Since March 2011 the collaboration in this forum is suspended. = Folklore Protection = Protecting Traditional Knowledge and Expression of Folklore may be a concern for Publishers that publish fairy tales and traditional stories, school books with reference to local customs, or related scientific journal articles. There have been several international efforts for special protection of traditional folklore, notably by WIPO and UNESCO. Currently, IPA participates in discussions through WIPO‚Äôs program for traditional cultural expressions. IPA tries to make sure the rights of freedom of expression and publisher‚Äôs positive impact relating to such cultural material are not threatened.wipo.int  Industry Policy = World Book Capital Cities  IPA proposed the idea of nominating one city a year as a World Book Capital, under which cities must promote books and foster books through various events, while conforming to the principles of freedom of expression, freedom to publish and to disseminate information.\\"origins-a-rationale\\" The title enables the promotion and communication of the winning city and is also a symbolic achievement. A nominating committee (formed of IPA, IFLA, IBF and UNESCO) decides on the city each year. Following Madrid, Alexandria, and New Delhi, the current and past capitals are as follows. 2004: Antwerp (Belgium); 2005: Montreal (Canada); 2006: Turin (Italy); 2007: Bogot√° (Colombia); 2008: Amsterdam (The Netherlands); 2009: Beirut (Lebanon); 2010: Ljubljana (Slovenia); 2011: Buenos Aires (Argentina); 2012: Yerevan (Armenia).  Value Added Taxes (VAT)  The IPA advocates for favorable indirect tax systems such as VAT on publications of all formats. For VAT purposes IPA considers books should be ‚Äúzero-rated.‚Äù Such policies have been already implemented in the UK, Norway, Korea, Mexico, Thailand. In its 2010 Global Survey for VAT/GST/Sales tax rates for books and electronic publications, it has been reported that 15 countries have exemptions for all books, 33 have reduced rates for all books, 26 have reduced or exemption for books with limitations, and 13 have no reductions that apply.  International Standards  As an international federation, one of the activities of the IPA is to facilitate the setting of international standards in publishing. One of the most famous and most used international standards are ISBN and ISSN a unique multi-digit identifier for individual books and periodicals, respectively (both print and electronic)IPA is an observer to the International ISBN Agency Board and has the right to attend all board meetings to represent the publishing industry's interests. Other assisting organizations in the ISBN Agency include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). IPA maintains liaison relationships with the ISO team working on information resources. Other systems the IPA supports through creator organizations are the Automated Content Access Protocol (ACAP) and ONIX. It is a charter member of EDItEUR, an international organization coordinating standard setting for electronic publications,  Educational Publishing  The IPA created the International Educational Publishers Forum to support a sustainable educational publishing industry. Digital Migration of educational material, a topic associated with curriculum change, new technologies, and piracy prevention, has been a recent issue in this forum. The forum‚Äôs main aim is to voice effectively the benefits of an innovative, diverse and high quality publishing industry in open markets.  Free Book Circulation  Part of the IPA‚Äôs mission is to distribute free literary materials to those in need. To fulfill this mission the IPA maintains working relations with UNESCO. The IPA supports the Florence Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials (1950) and the Nairobi Protocol (1976). These international treaties allow for the free circulation of educational, scientific, and cultural materials without customs fees. One hundred countries around the world have ratified the Florence Agreement. The IPA also helped establish UNESCO‚Äôs World Book and Copyright Day. The purpose of this day is to promote reading, publishing and the protection of intellectual property through copyright.

Glow's early career was on the road with Artie Shaw, Woody Herman and others during the last years of the big-band era. The majority of his years were spent as a first-rate New York City studio musician, where he worked with Miles Davis and Frank Sinatra, and did thousands of radio and television recording sessions.  Training  At The High School of Music & Art, during the Second World War,\\"Notable Alumni,\\" Alumni & Friends of LaGuardia High School. Accessed Nov. 9, 2016. Bernie played in bands with future notables Stan Getz, Tiny Khan, Shorty Rogers and George Wallington. Other than the influence of symphonic trumpet masters and his peers, Glow was influenced early on by performances of Snooky Young with the Jimmie Lunceford band, and Billy Butterfield with Benny Goodman.  Early Career 1942-1949  Just sixteen and out of high school, Glow spent a year on the road with the Richard Himber Orchestra. Two years later he was with Xavier Cugat and then Raymond Scott on CBS radio. In 1945 he was playing lead trumpet with the Artie Shaw band. Following that stint, he was with Boyd Raeburn. In 1949, at 23, he retired from the road after more than a year with Woody Herman and his famous \\"Second Herd\\".  NYC Freelance Years 1949-1952  In this middle period Glow worked as a trumpet player in a wide variety of situations. He played in big bands, Latin bands and dance orchestras. He performed around Manhattan in theaters, dance halls, night clubs and on the radio. This was the final preparation that launched him into the burgeoning commercial and studio scene.  Studio Years 1950s-1970s  Beginning in 1953 Bernie Glow was a first-call trumpet player and played on thousands of recording sessions. There was great variety in the kinds of music being recorded; One day he would play a radio commercial for Pepsi, and the next he would record an album with Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald. Many of these studio big-band sessions were led by leading composer/arrangers Nelson Riddle, Quincy Jones and Oliver Nelson. He played on the seminal Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaborations that produced the masterpiece albums Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), Sketches of Spain (1959), and Quiet Nights (1962). Glow also spent time as a member of the NBC and CBS staff orchestras. He played a Bach Stradivarius Bb 72* (lightweight) trumpet.

Her work covers many topics from childcare and gender issues to poverty and Social Security. Bergmann was a co-founder and President of the International Association for Feminist Economics, a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, and Professor Emerita of Economics at the University of Maryland and American University.  History  Bergmann's parents and grandparents, fleeing anti-Semitism, immigrated to the United States from Europe in 1914. She was born in 1927 to a Romanian-born mother and Polish-born father in the Bronx. Her parents worked instead of finishing school, but they expected Barbara to adhere to the standards and traditions of American life and eventually go to college. At the age of five, she started formulating ideas about feminism, pursuing equality for men and women, because she wanted to be an independent person when she grew up, and that required money and equality. During the Great Depression, Bergmann developed a strong belief that the government should provide resources and help to individuals who faced uncontrollable circumstances or did not have the resources and knowledge to provide for themselves. Bergmann received a scholarship to Cornell University and majored in mathematics. While in college pursuing her love for ‚Äúcreating models of simple processes that might or might not resemble what goes on in the actual economy,‚Äù she discovered Gunnar Myrdal‚Äôs book An American Dilemma that told of the racial inequality in the South. Myrdal's book ignited an interest in race discrimination that eventually developed into a concern for sex discrimination and followed Bergmann throughout her career. After Bergmann graduated with a B.A. in 1948, the recession, discrimination against Jews, and workplace sex segregation made it difficult to find a job that was interesting. Bergmann took a job with the federal government in the New York Office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics where she fielded public inquiries; she was head of the inquiries unit after a year. A firsthand experience with the discrimination of a black employee at the Bureau of Labor Statistics illuminated how real and pervasive race discrimination was at the time. Harvey Purdy was the only black employee at the New York office and, when Barbara managed to get him promoted, he was demoted shortly after and the job was given to someone else. Bergmann received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1959 and developed an interest in computer simulated economics, realizing that economics should be based more on observation and field research than solely theorizing. Research and experience has led Barbara Bergmann to develop theories and ideas about government policy, the implementation of observation into economics, and racial and gender equality.Email Interview between Barbara Bergmann and Tara Grigg. March 28, 2007.  Organizational involvement  During the Kennedy administration Barbara Bergmann was a senior staff member of the President's Council of Economic Advisors and she was a Senior Economic Adviser with the Agency for International Development. She also served as an advisor to the Congressional Budget Office and the Bureau of the Census. In 1965 she joined the University of Maryland, teaching there until 1988. From 1988 until 1997 she taught economics at American University. Bergmann was also involved in numerous national and international organizations that promote advancement and equality. She served as chair of the American Economic Association Committee on the Status of Women in Economic Professions, and president of the Eastern Economic Association, the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics, the American Association of University Professors (1990-1992), and the International Association for Feminist Economics (1999-2000).  Awards  Barbara Bergmann received the 2004 Carolyn Shaw Bell Award for increasing the status of women in economics and creating an understanding of how women can advance in the academic field.  Ideas  Bergmann has made two main contributions to economics. First, she has argued that discrimination is a pervasive characteristic of labor markets. Second, she has argued against the traditional economic methodology of drawing conclusions from a set of unrealistic assumptions.  Economics  Bergmann argues that ‚Äúa lot of what is bad does come from capitalism, but that can be corrected by appropriate government regulations, and by the generous government provision of important services and safety nets. But a lot of what is good and indispensable comes from capitalism too‚Äù. Bergmann studied microsimulation at Harvard University with computer generated simulation that provided a model with equations of macrovariables constructed on analogies of microeconomics. She believes that microsimulation provides ‚Äúrigor, realism, and an ability to incorporate complexities revealed by more empirical investigations into the workings of business.‚Äù In a class with Professor Edward Chamberlin at Harvard, Bergmann discovered that economic theory, regardless of its ingenuity or prevalence in the field, can actually produce a different picture of the economy than reality. It was in a market experiment in Chamberlin's class that Bergmann started to believe that economic theory needed to be influenced by actual observation of individuals. One of her personal views of economics is ‚Äúthat true anecdotes may well contain more valuable information about the state of things in the world than do economists‚Äô theories, which are by and large nothing but (possibly untrue) stories made up by economists sitting in their offices, with no factual input whatever‚Äù. Bergmann holds that observation and empirical evidence can lead to theories that actually reflect human behavior instead of producing theories on paper that do not always work in reality. She argues that macroeconomics can fix many social problems and economic policy can be used to enhance the lives of individuals, but economists are too persuaded by political affiliation to work toward a common goal.  Gender equality  Barbara Bergmann notes that equality of the sexes was not present throughout civilization ‚Äì around there is an economic and social division of labor between men and women historically. Although there has been an influx of women into the labor market and men are performing a larger amount of household labor, there is still an economic division between men and women. Bergmann views the best and most feasible option for equality to be ‚Äúhigh commodification‚Äù where many of the household tasks and childcare predominantly performed by women are outsourced to organizations and individuals. ‚ÄúHigh commodification‚Äù would include government subsidies for childcare and availability for stipends for married couples and single mothers. Bergmann believes that an increase in commodificaion alone cannot bring about equality, but there also needs to be ‚Äúan end to discrimination in employment, highly competitive behavior by women, and extra resources from government for families who are raising children.‚Äù Bergmann has a passion for gender equality and desires to see government provisions for equitable treatment of women in the workforce.

Gram-positive bacterium characteristics include small irregular rods, lateral flagella, the ability to persist in aerobic environments, and cells containing catalase. In the interest of studying pathogenicity in plants, the species Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens is broken down further into pathovars, which help to better describe the pathogen. Hosts and symptoms Curtobacterium flaccumfacien is a bacterial wilt pathogen. The hallmark symptoms of bacterial wilt are leaf and petiole wilting. Chlorosis of the leaf and tissue occurs due to the lack of water transport. Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens as a species has a wide host range not limited to kidney beans, soybeans, tulips, and tomatoes. However, the species is artificially separated into a pathovar based on host range and symptoms. One of the economically important pathovars is Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. Flaccumfaciens. This pathovar is classified as bacterial wilt and has a primary host range of the genus Phaseolus (beans), but the pathogen can infect many other species of the Fabaceae. In beans the symptoms can be devastating to the crop yield. These beans have severe foliage wilting and chlorosis. One ornamental example is Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. oortii. The primary host are plants from the genus Tulipa (Tulip). Although the host range differs, the symptoms are relatively similar. During flowering typical symptoms of dehydration are observed. Similarly to beans, the tulips get wilt. In severe cases, the plant eventually fails to recover from wilting and dies. Disease cycle Survival Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens can overwinter in plant debris, diseased plants, wild hosts, seeds, or vegetative propagative organs. The bacteria can survive only a couple of weeks as free bacteria in soil. Multiple factors go into survival of a bacterial population, including temperature, humidity, and soil characteristics. Infected seeds cannot be used for susceptible bean crops because Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens has been known to survive in dried bean pods from five years and up to 24 years in laboratory conditions. Different pathovars survive in slightly different ways. For example, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. oortii survive in the vegetative propagative organs (bulbs) rather than in the seeds, like Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens. Dispersal Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens causes wilting at high populations and disperses in many ways. The bacteria multiply relatively quickly which increases the possibility that Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens can shed from dying or dead plant material. The pathogen is normally dispersed via agricultural practices such as, planting saved seed and through farm equipment. In the case of beans & tulips these practices move the propagule during overwriting phase of their life cycles. This is effective dispersal for the pathogen. Infection Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens usually enters the plant though a wound. Natural wounds (created by excision of flowers or genesis of lateral roots) and unnatural wounds could become entry sites. There are no reports of vectors, but the nematode Meloidogyne incognita may assist entry by providing unnatural wounds. Management Management varies for each between hosts. For this purpose, we will look specifically at the detection and control methods of Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens. Since most plant pathogens are Gram-negative detection of Gram-positive bacterium, using methods such as the KOH test, is a beginners diagnostic tool used to identify this bacterium. Bacteria may be detected beneath the seedcoat by means of a combined cultural and slide agglutination test. Bean seed from countries where the disease is known to occur should be inspected for discoloration of the seedcoat. Immunofluorescence staining can also be used to detect the bacterium in contaminated seed lots. Control may be affected by using disease-free seed and crop rotations. Seeds grown in dry climates are usually free from infection and are, therefore, recommended for distribution. The strongest control regulations handed down by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection (EPPO) to date was a quarantine procedure. There is little resistance available commercially to Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens and antibiotics are ineffective.

Boroughs can either be second-level semi-autonomous administrative divisions ‚Äìas it is the case in the Mexico City‚Äì or third-level non-autonomous administrative divisions ‚Äìas it is the case in all other municipalities that have implemented this particular territorial organization. The limits, nature and competencies of boroughs are usually described in the constitutions of the states they are part of, or in the laws enacted by the municipality itself, and may differ from municipality to municipality. Municipalities of Mexico City The 16 boroughs of the Federal District Since Mexico City does not belong to any particular state, but to the federation, it is a federal district, and as such, a first-level administrative division on par with the states of Mexico, even if it differs in the nature of its autonomy and legislative powers. The 16 boroughs in which the Federal District is divided are semi-autonomous, in that a head of government, called simply \\"head of the borough\\" (jefe delegacional, in Spanish), is elected by the residents through direct suffrage. However, unlike the municipalities of Mexico, they do not have regulatory powers, and many of the services are still provided by the government of the Federal District itself. The boroughs of the Federal District are, nonetheless, second-level administrative divisions, and are usually included in cross-municipal statistical comparisons with the municipalities of Mexico, which are the internal divisions of the states. Boroughs of other municipalities The boroughs of other municipalities are territorial or administrative divisions and in some cases they pertain exclusively to the urbanized areas of the municipality, which is a second-level administrative division. As such, and unlike the boroughs of Federal District, boroughs of municipalities are third- level administrative divisions. They are non-autonomous, but function merely as the internal divisions whereby the administration of public services is organized. Not all municipalities are divided into boroughs; some municipalities only use auxiliary councils or presidencies (presidencia auxiliar in Spanish) to administer the cities or towns that are not adjacent to the city that serves as the seat of the municipal council (ayuntamiento in Spanish), whereas boroughs are usually -but not always- used when the entire municipality is urbanized and is coextensive with a single city. Some of the municipalities that are divided into boroughs are: * Baja California :Municipality of Mexicali, is divided into 14 boroughs composing the entire municipality, the city of Mexicali comprises the municipal seat plus 3 metropolitan boroughs.Organigrama del Gobierno de Mexicali :Municipality of Tijuana, is divided into 8 boroughs that compose the entire municipality, the city of Tijuana metropolitan area comprises all 8 boroughs.Ayuntamiento de Tijuana :Municipality of Ensenada, the largest municipality in the country is divided in 24 boroughs of which the city of Ensenada comprises the two smallest (Ensenada and Chapultepec).Boroughs of Ensenada :Municipality of Tecate, is divided into 6 boroughs composing the entire municipality.Delegaciones del Ayuntamiento de Tecate * Quer√©taro :Quer√©taro, is divided into 7 boroughs that compose the entire municipality, most of which is urbanized.

It was filmed in CinemaScope and Eastmancolor and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It is the fourth movie version of Kismet. The first Kismet was released in 1920, the second in 1930 by Warner Brothers, and the third, starring Ronald Colman and Marlene Dietrich, was released by MGM in 1944. The 1955 film is based on the successful 1953 musical Kismet, while the three earlier versions are based on the original 1911 play by Edward Knoblock. Plot In old Baghdad, an impoverished poet (Howard Keel) is abducted and brought to the desert tent of Jawan (Jay C. Flippen), an elderly thief, having been mistaken for a man who cursed Jawan fifteen years ago. As a result of the curse, Jawan's beloved son was kidnapped, and Jawan longs to find him again before he dies. The Poet asks for one hundred gold pieces to reverse the curse; Jawan agrees, and returns to Baghdad to look for his son. In Baghdad, the Poet's daughter, Marsinah (Ann Blyth) meets and falls in love with the young Caliph (Vic Damone), who has been traveling incognito. They arrange to meet again that night. The Poet is arrested when he begins spending his hundred gold pieces because his purse carries the insignia of a wealthy family that was robbed. At the Wazir's (Sebastian Cabot) court, he defends himself against the charge of robbery, but also curses the Wazir. Jawan, brought before the Wazir on another charge, angrily confirms the Poet's story, and then notices a familiar amulet around the Wazir's neck. In this way, Jawan discovers his long-lost son. The Caliph announces that he plans to take a bride that night, discomforting the Wazir, who has a badly needed loan riding on persuading the Caliph to marry a princess of Ababu. The Wazir, fearing that the Poet's curse had something to do with it, offers to make the Poet an Emir if he reverses the curse. The Poet happily accepts, and when the Wazir leaves him alone with his favorite wife Lalume (Dolores Gray), the two realize they have similar temperaments. The Poet orchestrates an elaborate \\"curse-reversal\\" scheme that enables him to sneak out of the palace; he finds Marsinah and convinces her that he will be killed unless they flee Baghdad. Despite Marsinah's protests‚Äîshe wants to wait for her rendezvous and see the Caliph's wedding procession‚Äîthey flee. Word spreads that the Caliph's bride was not there when the Caliph came to claim her. Since the \\"curse reversal\\" seems to have worked, the Poet leaves Marsinah and returns to the palace. The Poet tells Lalume that he is worried about Marsinah, and Lalume suggests that she come to live in the palace. Marsinah arrives and confesses that she has fallen in love but does not know her beloved's name. Lalume hides Marsinah in the harem for her own protection, but there the Caliph sees her and believes her to be a wife of the Wazir. When the Wazir privately congratulates the Poet on bringing the Caliph's true love into the Wazir's own harem, the Poet realizes that the Caliph is Marsinah's beloved. At a ceremony planned to choose a new bride, the Poet tricks the Wazir and (almost) drowns him in front of the Caliph and the crowd. The Poet is sentenced to death, but Lalume saves the day as Marsinah is revealed to be the Poet's daughter and the victim of the Wazir's scheming. The Caliph sentences the Wazir to death and the Poet to exile. The Poet agrees, but asks to take the soon-to-be-widowed Lalume with him. Thus the Poet weds Lalume and the Caliph weds Marsinah‚Äîall in the course of a single day.

He is best known for his 1987 poem \\"Fun\\", which was adapted by Sheryl Crow and Bill Bottrell into the lyrics of Crow's 1994 breakthrough single \\"All I Wanna Do\\". Background Cooper was raised in Michigan and later attended the University of Utah and Hollins College. He has taught at the University of Utah, Bennington College, Marlboro College, and at The Frost Place Festival of Poetry. His most recent book is Mars Poetica (White Pine Press, 2018) His earlier books are Chaos is the New Calm (BOA Editions, 2010), Postcards from the Interior (BOA Editions, 2005), The Way Back (White Pine Press, 2000), and The Country of Here Below (Ahsahta Press, 1987). Cooper's poems, stories, essays, and reviews have appeared in Poetry, Orion, AGNI, Crazyhorse, and Ploughshareshttp://www.pshares.org/authors/author-detail.cfm?authorID=310 and are included in 25 anthologies of contemporary poetry. One of his poems, Fun, was used for the lyrics of the Sheryl Crow song, \\"All I Wanna Do\\". Crow's producer Bill Bottrell discovered Cooper's poetry book The Country of Here Below in Cliff's Books, a Pasadena, California used bookstore. Bottrell adapted Fun into the lyrics for her song when Crow could not come up with usable lyrics‚Äîearning Cooper considerable royalties, and helping to publicise his book, originally published in a run of only 500 copies in 1987, into multiple reprints. He also wrote lyrics for a fictional band in Madison Smartt Bell's novel, Anything Goes. The songs were put to music by Bell, recorded and produced by Don Dixon and released as 40 Words for Fear in 2003. The second Bell and Cooper cd, Postcards Out of the Blue, was based in part on Cooper's book Postcards from the Interior. Their songs have been used on 6 television shows. Cooper has also written and recorded songs with David Broza, David Baerwald, and Jody Redhage. Cooper has served as editor of Quarterly West and recently worked for the Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute, a think tank run by the Poetry Foundation of Chicago.

It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in colour. The first horses were released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction. In 1960, the Canadian government protected the horses by law in their feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd studies have been performed, and in 2007 a genetic analysis was conducted that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, the horses were declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. The herd is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans. The horses live only at Sable Island and, until 2019, at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s. Characteristics Typical colour patterns The horses that remain on Sable Island are feral. They generally stand between . Males from the island average about and females about . The available food on the island limits their size, and the offspring of horses removed from the island and fed more nutritious diets are generally larger. Physically, the horses resemble Iberian horses, with arched necks and sloping croups. Overall, they are stocky and short, with short pasterns that allow them to move easily on sandy or rough ground. Sable Island horses have very shaggy coats, manes and tails, especially during the winter. The tail is full and low-set. Their coats are mostly dark colours, but some do have white markings. About half are bays, with the rest distributed among chestnut, palomino and black. Many Sable Island Horses have a natural ambling gait. Prior to their protection, when they could be kept for the use of humans, the horses were known for their sure-footedness and gaits. The Sable Island horses are a feral horse population that is entirely unmanaged: they are not subject to any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after their teeth are worn down by a lifetime of exposure to sand and marram, a tough grass. History Sable Island is a narrow, crescent-shaped island located approximately southeast of Nova Scotia. It is long and covered in sand dunes and grasses. Over 350 bird species and 190 plant species are found on the island, in addition to the herd of feral horses, which are the most well-known inhabitants. Ponies in Halifax, Nova Scotia for auction in 1902, after having been removed from the island Although popular legends claim that Sable Island horses swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were introduced by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, this is not supported by historical or genetic evidence. In reality, the horses were deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded horses were brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day horses are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from horses seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian horses were descendants of several shipments of French horses, including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with horses from New England, including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and shipowner Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian horses and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture. Although often referred to as ponies due to their small size, they have a horse phenotype and an ancestry composed solely of horses. After the government of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station on Sable Island in 1801, workers trained some of the horses to haul supplies and rescue equipment. Lifesaving staff recorded the importation of a stallion, Jolly, taken there in 1801, who was probably similar in type to the original Acadian horses released on the island. Although Jolly was not the first horse on the island, he was the first to be identified by name in historic records, and is known to have survived on the island until at least 1812. Other breeding stock, probably including horses of Thoroughbred, Morgan and Clydesdale breeding, were sent to the island during the first half of the 19th century, in the hopes of improving the type of horses found on the island and raising the price for which they could be sold on the mainland. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the horses on Sable Island were periodically rounded up and either kept by islanders or transported to the mainland, where they were sold, frequently for slaughter. The meat was primarily used for dog food by the late 1950s, and the island horses were in danger of extinction. A public campaign was begun by school children to save the horses. In 1960, as part of the Canadian Shipping Act, the Canadian government declared the horses fully protected and no longer able to be rounded up and sold. The law requires that people receive written permission before they can \\"molest, interfere with, feed or otherwise have anything to do with the ponies on the Island.\\" Study and preservation Sable Island Horses at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Beginning in the mid-1980s, long term studies were begun of the Sable Island herds, and by the mid-2000s, most horses living on the island had documented histories. In 2007, a genetic analysis of the Sable Island herd was performed. It was concluded that these horses were genetically similar to multipurpose and light draft breeds found in eastern mainland Canada, with differences probably created by natural selection and genetic drift. However, the researchers also stated that Sable Island horses had genetically \\"diverged enough from other breeds to deserve special attention by conservation interest groups,\\" and that the loss of the Sable Island horses would be more damaging to the genetic diversity of the Canadian horse population than the loss of any other breed. Genetic erosion is a possibility within the Sable Island population, due to the small number of horses. In a study of mitochondrial DNA published in 2012, the Sable Island horse was found to be the least genetically diverse of the 24 horse populations studied, which included horse and pony breeds as well as feral populations from North America and Europe. A 2014 study by Parks Canada stated that the horses were under threat from their low numbers, excessive inbreeding and extreme weather due to global warming. In 2008, the Nova Scotia Legislature declared the Sable Island Horse as one of the provincial symbols, making them the official horse of Nova Scotia. In 2011, the Canadian government created the Sable Island National Park Reserve, which allows further protection of the island and horses. Aside from the island, until 2019, Sable Island Horses lived only at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. It maintained descendants of Sable Island Ponies removed from the island in the 1950s by the Canadian Department of Transport. The last remaining horse was euthanized in September of 2019. Nonetheless, some continue to view the horses as an invasive species which is not suitable in a protected region where ecological integrity should be preserved according to the National Parks Act. A study published in 2019 found that the Sable Island horses had about three times the level of parasite eggs in their fecal material than domesticated horses, averaging 1500 eggs per gram. These included a parasitic lungworms that caused respiratory diseases; the horses also suffered from reproductive diseases. Necropsies of carcasses inspected in 2017 and 2018 showed that young horses died of starvation and hypothermia, particularly during extreme winters, as they would not have a sufficient reserve of body fat and suitable vegetation is sparse on the island during winter. Adults died of other causes. These results confirmed a similar study from 1972. The study also found that these horses incidentally consume significant quantities of sand, which gradually wears down their teeth and blocks their gastrointestinal tract. During the 2018 study, the estimated population was 500 horses, up from the roughly 300 recorded in the 1970s. Typical mortality rates are about 1% annually; during a harsh 2017 spring, the mortality rate was 10%.

Though poor in wealth and education, he remained one of the most prolific and original contributor to Odia literature. Childhood Gangadhara was born in 1862 on the full moon day of Shravana Purnima at Barpali of present-day Bargarh district of Odisha. Chaitanya Meher was working as a village Vaidya (Ayurvedic doctor) besides his family profession of weaving. But as he could not maintain his family with the income of these works, he opened a village school and began to teach a few children. Gangadhara Meher could read up to the Middle Vernacular Standard hurdling over diverse disadvantages, and his keen eagerness for literature eventually sparked his skills in writing poems. As a young boy, he heard the Odia Ramayana composed by Balarama Dasa and afterwards he himself read it as well as the Odia Mahabharata by Sarala Dasa. He also read and mastered a great number of Sanskrit books; of which ‚ÄòRaghuvamsham‚Äô, deserve mention. Tulasi Ramayana in Awadhi used to be held by him in great respect. He used to read Bengali magazines and newspapers. Gangadhara got married at the age of 10. As his father‚Äôs pecuniary condition was not satisfactory, Gangadhar used to go to school in the morning and help his father in weaving in the afternoon. His clear and beautiful hand writing also garnered attention from many people willing to get their transcribed by him. The pecuniary condition of the family improved a bit due to his hard labour when to the misfortune of the family, the ancestral house caught fire. Career The then Zamindar of Barpali, Lal Nruparaj Singh offered him the post of an Amin (Patwari). Coming to learn of amicable behaviours and good virtues of Gangadhara, the Zamindar promoted him to the post of a Moharir. He continued to serve in the said post and was transferred to Sambalpur, Bijepur and Padmapur and at last transferred to him own native place Barapali on a salary of Rs.30/- per month. The poet was very liberal and progressive socially. During the last age of his life, the poet organized an All Odisha Social Conference of Mehers with a view to uplifting the entire weaver society. Nearly three thousand Mehers from different parts of Odisha assembled in the Conference. The poet put up twelve proposals for the reform of the society and all were passed unanimously. Literary career Gangadhara started composing poems from a very tender age. His first writings follow the style and technique of the ancient Odia writers. His first (poetic work) was ‚ÄúRasa-Ratnakara‚Äù. Then being persuaded by some friends he changed his ways and wrote poems and in the modern Odia style. Kabibara Radhanatha Ray praised his writing very much. The works produced by Gangadhara Meher are marked by vivid imagination, in beauty and clarity of language, in the novelty of style, in point of forceful character painting and in the lively description of nature from different perspectives. His writings remain as some of greatest creations in Odia literature. Institution and award named after Gangadhar Meher In 1949, Sambalpur College which is in Sambalpur district, opened in 1944 was renamed Gangadhar Meher College in his honour later upgraded to a university, now it is known by Gangadhar Meher University. In 2015, this college was upgraded to a university. Sambalpur University, Burla, instituted the Gangadhar Meher National Award for Poetry which is conferred annually on the foundation day of Sambalpur University. In January 2020 the Gangadhar Meher National award will be conferred to Viswanath Prasad Tiwari.

Background By the 18th century, \\"white\\" had become well established as a racial term at a time when the enslavement of African-Americans was widespread.Roediger, Wages of Whiteness, 186; Tony Horwitz, Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War (New York, 1998). David R. Roediger has argued that the construction of the \\"white race\\" in the United States was an effort to mentally distance slave owners from slaves. The process of officially being defined as white by law often came about in court disputes over pursuit of citizenship. The Naturalization Act of 1790 offered naturalization only to \\"any alien, being a free white person\\". In at least 52 cases, people denied the status of white by immigration officials sued in court for status as white people. By 1923, courts had vindicated a \\"common-knowledge\\" standard, concluding that \\"scientific evidence\\" was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a \\"performance-based\\" standard, relating to religious practices, culture, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.John Tehranian, \\"Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America,\\" The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 109, No. 4. (Jan., 2000), pp. 817-848. The 2000 U.S. census states that racial categories \\"generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country. They do not conform to any biological, anthropological or genetic criteria.\\"Questions and Answers for Census 2000 Data on Race from U.S. Census Bureau, 14 March 2001. Retrieved 15 October 2006. It defines \\"white people\\" as \\"people having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.The White Population: 2000, Census 2000 Brief C2KBR/01-4, U.S. Census Bureau, August 2001. The Federal Bureau of Investigation uses the same definition.Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook , U.S. Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigation. P. 97 (2004) The 1990 US Census Public Use Microdata Sample listed \\"Caucasian\\" or \\"Aryan\\" ancestry responses as subgroups of \\"white\\" but the 2005 PUMS codes do not. In U.S. census documents, the designation white or Caucasian may overlap with the term Hispanic, which was introduced in the 1980 census as a category of ethnicity, separate and independent of race. In cases where individuals do not self- identify, the U.S. census parameters for race give each national origin a racial value.  Specific ethnic groups = African Americans  Laws dating from 17th-century colonial America excluded children of at least one black parent from the status of being white. Early legal standards did so by defining the race of a child based on a mother's race while banning interracial marriage, while later laws defined all people of some African ancestry as black, under the principle of hypodescent. Some 19th-century categorization schemes defined people with one black parent (the other white) as mulatto, with one black grandparent as quadroon and with one black great grandparent as octoroon. The latter categories remained within an overall black or African-American category. Many members of these categories passed temporarily or permanently as white.Winthrop Jordan, Black Over White, ch. IV, \\"The Fruits of Passion.\\" Since several thousand blacks have been crossing the color line each year, the phenomenon known as \\"passing for white\\", millions of white Americans have recent African ancestors. A statistical analysis done in 1958 estimated that 21 percent of the white population had African ancestors. The study concluded that the majority of Americans of African descent were actually white and not black. Hispanic Americans Hispanic Americans are Americans who have a significant number of Spanish-speaking Latin American ancestors or Spanish ancestors. While Latin Americans have a broad array of ethnic, racial and cultural backgrounds, they all tend to be indiscriminately labeled 'Hispanic', giving that term a \\"racial\\" value. It was not until the 1980s after years of protest from the Chicano movement the United States government created the term Hispanic to classify all peoples who come from Spanish-speaking countries. The term Hispanic has in recent years in the United States been given racial value with the perception of a racial Hispanic look being that of Native American race or of the Mixed races usually Mestizo or Mulatto as the majority of the people who immigrate from Spanish-speaking countries to the United States are of that racial origin. Due to this racial perception of Hispanics even among Hispanic Americans themselves, white U.S. Hispanics and Latinos, black U.S. Hispanics and Latinos, and Asian U.S. Hispanics and Latinos are often overlooked in the U.S. mass media and in general American social perceptions. The white Hispanics and Latinos who are perceived as \\"Hispanic\\" by Americans usually possess typical Mediterranean/Southern European pigmentation - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes - as most Spanish and white Latin American immigrants are and most white Hispanics and Latinos are. On the 2000 Census form, race and ethnicity are distinct questions. A respondent who checks the \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" ethnicity box must also check one or more of the five official race categories. Of the over 35 million Hispanics or Latinos in the 2000 Census, a plurality of 48.6% identified as \\"white,\\" 48.2% identified as \\"Other\\" (most of whom are presumed of mixed races such as mestizo or mulatto), and the remaining 3.2% identified as \\"black\\" and other races. By 2010, the number of Hispanics identifying as white has increased by a wide margin since the year 2000 on the 2010 Census form, of the over 50 million people who identified as Hispanic and Latino Americans a majority 53% identified as \\"white\\", 36.7% identified as \\"Other\\" (most of whom are presumed of mixed races such as mestizo or mulatto), 6% identified as \\"Two or more races\\", 2.5% identified as \\"Black\\", 1.4% identified as \\"American Indian and Alaska Native\\", and the remaining 0.5% identified as other races. The media and some Hispanic community leaders in the United States refer to Hispanics as a separate group from all others, as well as \\"whites\\" and the \\"white majority\\". This may be because \\"white\\" is often used as shorthand for \\"non-Hispanic white\\". Thus, the non-Hispanic population and some Hispanic community leaders refer to white Hispanics as non-Hispanic whites and white Hispanic actors/actresses in media are mostly given non- Hispanic roles while, in turn, are given the most roles in the U.S. Hispanic mass media that the white Hispanics are overrepresented and admired in the U.S. Hispanic mass media and social perceptions. Multiracial Latinos have limited media appearance; critics have accused the U.S. Hispanic media of overlooking the brown-skinned indigenous and multiracial Hispanic and black Hispanic populations by over-representation of blond and blue/green-eyed white Hispanic and Latino Americans and also light-skinned mulatto and mestizo Hispanic and Latino Americans (often deemed as white persons in U.S. Hispanic and Latino populations if achieving the middle class or higher social status), especially some of the actors on the telenovelas. =Mexican Americans= The official racial status of Mexican Americans has varied throughout American history. From 1850 to 1920, the U.S. Census form did not distinguish between whites and Mexican Americans. In 1930, the U.S. Census form asked for \\"color or race,\\" and census enumerators were instructed to write W for white and Mex for Mexican. In 1940 and 1950, the census reverted its decision and made Mexicans be classified as white again and thus the instructions were to \\"Report white (W) for Mexicans unless they were definitely of full Indigenous Indian or other non-white races (such as Black or Asian).\\" Official portrait of Mexican American Romualdo Pacheco in the California State Capitol. During periods in U.S. history when racial intermarriage wasn't legally acknowledged, and when Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were uniformly allotted white status, they were legally allowed to intermarry with what today are termed non- Hispanic whites, unlike Blacks and Asians. They were allowed to acquire U.S. citizenship upon arrival; served in all-white units during World War II; could vote and hold elected office in places such as Texas, especially San Antonio; ran the state politics and constituted most of the elite of New Mexico since colonial times; and went to segregated white schools in Central Texas and Los Angeles. Additionally, Asians were barred from marrying Mexican Americans because Mexicans were legally white. U.S. nativists in the late 1920s and 1930s (mostly due to the socially xenophobic and economic climate of the Great Depression) tried to put a halt to Mexican immigration by having Mexicans (and Mexican Americans) declared non-white, by virtue of their Indian heritage. After 70 years of being in the United States and having been bestowed white status by the U.S. government this was the first time the United States began to show true racist attitudes towards Mexicans in America something that usually came quickly to people of other races. They based their strategy on a 1924 law that barred entry to immigrants who were ineligible for citizenship, and at that point, only blacks and whites, and not Asians or Native Americans, could naturalize and become U.S. citizens. The test case came in December 1935, when a Buffalo, N.Y., judge rejected Jalisco native Timoteo Andrade's application for citizenship on the grounds that he was a \\"Mexican Indian.\\" Had it not been for the intervention of the Mexican and American governments, who forced a second hearing, this precedent could very well have made many Mexicans, the majority of whom are mestizo, ineligible for citizenship. When mixed race Mexicans were allowed to retain their white status in American society they were unperturbed with the fact that the United States still continued its discriminatory practices towards Mexicans of full Indigenous heritage. During the Great Depression, Mexicans were largely considered non- white. As many as 400,000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans were deported in a decade-long effort by the government called the Mexican Repatriation. In the 2000 U.S census, around half of all persons of Mexican or Mexican American origin in the U.S. checked white to register their race (in addition to stating their Mexican national origin). Mexican Americans are the largest white Hispanic group in the United States. =Latino Caribbean= Texas Senator Ted Cruz, of paternal Cuban ancestry, is of European descent. Caribbean countries such as Cuba, US territory of Puerto Rico and especially the Dominican Republic have a complex ethnic heritage since they include indigenous and African legacies. Africans were forcibly transported to the islands throughout the colonial period (and indeed Blacks accompanied the first Spanish explorers, with more arriving to harvest sugar in the 18th century prior to the Revolution). Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans exemplify this complex ethnic status. The Cuban exiles and the Puerto Rican who migrated, entered the United States before 1959 tended to be of European ancestry (most particularly Spanish ancestry) and therefore widely considered white. Their appearance let them be more accepted by an American culture that openly attacked Afro-Cubans and Afro-Puerto Ricans, and other races. In some cases, this white racial status \\"allowed them to feel superior over other racial and ethnic groups and to make claims to rights and privileges...\\" Native Americans In Oklahoma, state laws identified Native Americans as legally white during Jim Crow-era segregation.Kathleen O'Toole, \\"Toggling Between Ethnicities,\\" Stanford Today, November/December 1998. In the late 19th and 20th century, many saw Native Americans as people without a future, who should be assimilated into a larger American culture. Tribal membership was frequently defined according to so-called blood quantum standards (proven through a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood), so that people of mostly white ancestry and more distant Native ancestry were denied any formal ties with their ancestral tribe. This led to the classification of increasing numbers of people of distant indigenous ancestry as white. This trend has been reversed in census figures of recent decades, which show increasing self- identification among mixed-race people as ethnically/culturally Native American. The 2000 census includes \\"tribal affiliation or community attachment\\" as part of the definitions of American Indian and Alaska Native. Asian AmericansEast Asian Americans= Beginning in the mid-19th century, the United States experienced significant immigration from East Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Later, as a reaction against Chinese other East Asian immigrants as competitors with white labor, the Workingmen's Party was created in California. Xenophobic fears manifested with the Yellow Peril ideology, positing that Asians could outnumber the white population in some areas and become dominant. The Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted naturalized American citizenship to whites. However, United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898 confirmed citizenship by birth in the US regardless of race. As a result, in the early 20th century many new arrivals with origins in the Far East petitioned the courts to be legally classified as white, resulting in the existence of many United States Supreme Court rulings on their \\"whiteness\\". In 1922, the court case Takao Ozawa v. United States deemed that Japanese are part of the Mongoloid race, and thus non-white. In Jim Crow era Mississippi, however, Chinese American children were allowed to attend white-only schools and universities, rather than attend black-only schools, and some of their parents became members of the infamous Mississippi \\"White Citizens' Council\\" who enforced policies of racial segregation.James W. Loewen, The Mississippi Chinese: Between Black and White (Cambridge MA, 1971); Warren (1997), 200-18, 209-11. Despite an opposite trend in other parts of the United States, in 1927, the Supreme Court decision Lum v. Rice codified the right of states to define a Chinese student as non-white for the purpose of segregating public schools. As the Jim crow era lasted between 1876 and 1965 this effectively placed Lum v. Rice within that same time period. In a precursor to Brown v. Board the 1947, federal legal case Mendez v. Westminster fought to take down segregated schools for Mexican American and white students. In doing so, this prompted California Governor Earl Warren to repeal a state law calling for segregation of Native American and Asian American students in that state. Segregation of the American education system during the Jim Crow era also impacted East Asians, however the Mendez decision ended this impact on Asian Americans. As a result of the Wysinger vs. Crookshank, 82 Cal 588, 720, (1890) ruling, Black people were integrated into California's education system and thus never attended segregated public schools during the Jim Crow era in California. =West Asian and Central Asian Americans= The Census Bureau includes the \\"original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East\\" among white people. Under pressure from advocacy groups, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would consider establishing a new, MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the \\"white\\" category. If approved by the Census Bureau, the category would also require approval by Congress.\\"Lobbying for a 'MENA' category on U.S. Census\\" Wiltz, Teresea. USA Today. Published October 7, 2014. Accessed December 14, 2015. The courts ruled Middle Easterners as not white in the following cases: In re Halladjian (1909), Ex parte Shahid (1913), Ex Parte Dow (1914), In re Dow (1914), and In re Ahmed Hassan (1942). The courts ruled Arabs, Syrians, Middle Easterners, or Armenians to be white in the following cases: In re Najour (1909), In re Mudarri (1910), In re Ellis (1910), Dow v. United States (1915), United States v. Cartozian, and Ex Parte Mohriez (1944).  Arab Americans  From 1909 to 1944, members of Arab American communities in the United States sought naturalized citizenship through an official recognition as white. During this period, the courts were inconsistent in defining Arabs as white granting some eligibility for citizenship, while denying others. Therefore, in the first half of the twentieth century, many Arabs were naturalized as \\"white American\\" citizens, while others were deported as \\"non-white aliens.\\" One of the earliest cases includes the case of police officer George Shishim. Born in Zahle, Lebanon, Shishim immigrated to the United States in 1894 becoming a police officer in Venice, CA. According to Gualtieri (2009), Shishim‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal battle to prove his whiteness began after he arrested the son of a prominent lawyer for disturbing the peace.\\" The man arrested argued that because Shishim was not white, and thus ineligible for citizenship, that his arrest was invalid.\\"Dept. of Justice Affirms in 1909 Whether Syrians, Turks, and Arabs are of White or Yellow Race\\" Arab American Historical Foundation. Accessed December 14, 2015. Shishim's attorney's, with support from the Syrian-Lebanese and Arab communities, argued Arabs shared Caucasian ancestry and are thus white. Judge Frank Hutton, who presided over the case, cited legal precedent ruling that the term \\"white person\\" included Syrians. Despite this ruling, neither U.S. immigration authorities nor courts across the country consistently defined Arabs as whites, and many Arabs continued to be deported through the 1940s. Among the most important cases was Dow v. United States (1915) in which Syrian George Dow was determined to be of the ‚ÄúCaucasian‚Äù race and thus eligible for citizenship. In 1914, Judge Smith denied George Dow citizenship twice ruling that Syrians were not white and thus ineligible for citizenship. Dow appealed these decisions and in Dow v. United States (1915), the United States Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's decisions, defined Syrians as white, and affirmed Dow's right to naturalization. However, this decision did not apply to North Africans or non-Levantine Arabs, and some courts claimed that only Syrians (and not other Arab persons) were white. The situation was resolved in 1943, when all Arabs and North Africans were deemed white by the federal government. Ex Parte Mohriez (1944), and the 1977 OMB Directive 15 include Middle Eastern and North African in the definition of white.  Armenian Americans  Another 1909 immigration and naturalization case found that Armenians were white and thus eligible for citizenship. A U.S. Circuit Court judge in Boston, ruling on a citizenship application by four Armenians, overruled government objections and found that West Asians were so mixed with Europeans that it was impossible to tell whether they were white or should be excluded as part of the \\"yellow race\\". In making the ruling, the judge also noted that the government had already made no objection to Jews. The judge ruled that \\"if aboriginal people of Asia are excluded it is hard to find a loophole for the admission of Hebrews.\\"  Jewish Americans  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the racial classification of Jews in the United States was not settled, with many nativists describing them as \\"Mongoloid\\" and \\"Asiatic.\\" The United States Bureau of Immigration had classified Jews as \\"Slavonic\\" during the 19th century, but the Dillingham Commission contended that linguistic and physical criteria, including the \\"Jew's nose\\", classified Jews further down the Caucasian pecking order, as Semites. A 1909 Census Bureau ruling related to the case of George Shishim to classify Syrians as \\"Mongolians\\", thus non-white and ineligible for citizenship, caused American Jewish leaders to fear that Jews would soon be denaturalized as well.Goldstein, Eric L. The Price of Whiteness: Jews, Race, And American Identity. pp. 103-104 The racial status of Jews has continued to engender debate, with some commentators arguing that ethnic Jews, regardless of diaspora history, are non-white. =South Asian Americans= South Asian Americans constitute a broad group of ethnic groups and racial classification of each of these groups has varied over the years. The classification of Indian Americans has varied over the years and across institutions. Originally, neither the U.S. courts nor the census bureau categorized Indians as a race because there were only negligible numbers of Indian immigrants in the United States. Various court judgements instead deemed Indians to be \\"white\\" or \\"not white\\" for the purposes of law. Unlike Indian Americans, Sri Lankan Americans and Nepalese Americans have always been classified as \\"Asian\\". Before 1975, both groups were classified as \\"other Asian\\". In 1975, they were given their own separate categories within the broader Asian American category. In 1909, Bhicaji Balsara became the first Indian to gain U.S. citizenship, as a Zoroastrian Parsi he was ruled to be \\"the purest of Aryan type\\" and \\"as distinct from Hindus as are the English who dwell in India‚Äù. Almost thirty years later, the same Circuit Court to accept Balsara ruled that Rustom Dadabhoy Wadia, another Parsi also from Bombay was not white and therefore not eligible to receive U.S. citizenship. In 1923, the Supreme Court decided in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind that people of Indian descent were not ‚Äòwhite‚Äô men, and thus not eligible to citizenship.United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, Certificate From The Circuit Court Of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit., No. 202. Argued 11, 12 January 1923.‚ÄîDecided 19 February 1923, United States Reports, v. 261, The Supreme Court, October Term, 1922, 204‚Äì215. The court conceded that, while Thind was a high caste Hindu born in the northern Punjab region and classified by certain scientific authorities as of the Aryan race, he was not ‚Äòwhite‚Äô since the word Aryan \\"has to do with linguistic and not at all with physical characteristics\\" and since \\"the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences\\" between Indians and white Americans. Associate Justice George Sutherland wrote that Indians \\"cannot be properly assigned to any of the enumerated grand racial divisions.: Following the Thind ruling, the US government attempted to strip Indian-Americans of their citizenship, but were forced to drop many of the cases after losing their case against Thind's own lawyer, Sakharam Ganesh Pandit, who successfully argued that he would be unjustly harmed by removal of his American citizenship. The U.S. Census Bureau has over the years changed its own classification of Indians. In 1930 and 1940, Indian Americans were classified as \\"Hindu\\" by \\"Race\\", and in 1950 and 1960, they were categorized as Other Race, and in 1970, they were deemed white. Since 1980, Indians and other South Asians have been classified according to self-reporting,Campbell Gibson and Kay Jung, Historical Census Statistics On Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For Large Cities And Other Urban Places In The United States Working Paper no. 76 (2005); see footnote 6 in paper with many selecting \\"Asian Indian\\" to differentiate themselves from peoples of \\"American Indian\\" or Native American background.  European Americans Finnish Americans= The earliest Finnish immigrants to the U.S. were colonists who were Swedes in the legal sense and perhaps spoke Swedish. They settled in the Swedish colony of New Sweden. One of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America, John Morton, who signed the Declaration of Independence, was Finnish. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, descended from one of these 17th century Finnish colonists in New Sweden.http://www.oocities.org/vienna/8921/colonial.htmlJohn Powell, \\"Encyclopedia of North American immigration\\", p. 98 More recent Finns were on several occasions \\"racially\\" discriminated againstArmas Kustaa Ensio Holmio, \\"History of the Finns in Michigan\\", p. 17  She had barely reached the front porch when the friend's mother realized that her daughter's playmate was a Finn. Helmi was turned away immediately, and the daughter of the house was forbidden to associate with \\"that Mongolian\\". John Wargelin, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and a former president of Suomi College, also tells how, when he was a child in Crystal Falls some years earlier, he and his friends were ridiculed and stoned on their way to school. \\"Because of our strange language,\\" he says, \\"we were considered an alien race who had no right to settle in this country.\\" and not seen as white, but \\"Asian\\". The reasons for this were the arguments and theories about the Finns originally being of Mongolian instead of native European origin due to the Finnish language belonging to the Uralic and not the Indo-European language family.Eric Dregni, \\"Vikings in the attic: In search of Nordic America\\", p. 176 Minnesota, home to a strong mining industry at the turn of the 20th century, was the stage of several politically-motivated conflicts between laborers and anti-union leaders. In 1907, a group of between 10,000 and 16,000 immigrants ‚Äì the majority of whom were Finnish ‚Äì staged a large strike against Oliver Iron Mining Company. In response, the company began screening its immigrant-based workforce by their country of origin. Finns regularly comprised the most numerous and vocal groups of protestors, feeding into beliefs that the Finnish ethnic group was less capable of assimilating well into the American workforce. Oliver refused to hire more Finns. One year after the major strike, the company's superintendent stated: > Their people [the Finns] are good laborers but trouble breeders.... They are > a race that tries to take advantage of the companies at every opportunity > and are not to be trusted. content.sciendo.com/view/journals/njmr/4/4/article-p168.xml Acrimony towards Finnish social radicals in Minnesota's political milieu reached a head in the case of John Svan and 15 associates. On January 4, 1908, a trial was held regarding whether John Svan, an outspoken socialist, and several other Finnish immigrants would become naturalized United States citizens or not, as the process only was for \\"whites\\" and \\"blacks\\" in general and district prosecutor John Sweet maintained that Finnish immigrants were Mongols. Sweet linked the \\"socialistic ideology\\" of Finnish radicals with other collectivist East Asian philosophies to underscore his position that Finns were of an Asiatic frame of mind that was out of harmony with American thought. The judge, William A. Cant, later concluded that the Finnish people may have been Mongolian from the beginning, but that the climate they lived in for a long time, and historical Finnish immigration and assimilation of Germanic tribes (Teutons)‚Äîwhich he considered modern \\"pure Finns\\" indistinguishable from‚Äîhad made the Finnish population one of the whitest people in Europe. If the Finns had Mongol ancestry, it was distant and diluted. John Svan and the others were made naturalized U.S. citizens, and from that day on, the law forbade treating Finnish immigrants and Americans of Finnish descent as not white.Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio, \\"History of the Finns in Michigan\\", p. 23 In the beginning of the 20th century, there was a lot resentment from the local American population towards the Finnish settlers because they were seen as having very different customs, and were slow in learning English. Another reason was that many of them had come from the \\"red\\" side of Finland, and thus held socialist political views. =German Americans= Large numbers of Germans migrated to North America between the 1680s and 1760s. Many settled in the English colony of Pennsylvania. In the 18th century, many persons of English descent harbored resentment towards the increasing number of German settlers. Benjamin Franklin in \\"Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.\\", complained about the increasing influx of German Americans, stating that they had a negative influence on the early United States. The only exception were Germans of Saxon descent \\"who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased\\". Unlike most European immigrant groups, whose acceptance as white came gradually over the course of the late 19th century (that is, in U.S. colloquial definitions, since all Europeans were white by legal U.S. definition), German immigrants quickly became accepted as white.See David R. Roediger, The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class (London: Verso, 1991) p. 32 for their earlier status. See op. cit. p. 142 for Stephen O. Douglas's acceptance, in his debates against Abraham Lincoln, that Germans are a \\"branch of the Caucasian race.\\" See op. cit. p. 155 for anti-abolitionist tracts of 1864 accusing abolitionist German- Americans of having \\"broken their ties with the white race\\" by opposing slavery. See Leon F. Litwack, North of Slavery: the Negro in the Free States, 1790-1860 (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1961) p. 75 for the legislated disfranchisement of Pennsylvanians of African ancestry by the first state legislature controlled by German-Americans. =Irish Americans= Beginning in the 1840s, negative assessments of the \\"Irish character\\" became more and more racialized. Irish people were considered brutish and (like blacks) were often compared to simians. The \\"Celtic physiognomy\\" was described as being marked by an \\"upturned nose [and] the black tint of the skin.\\" =Italian Americans= In certain parts of the South during the Jim Crow era, Italians \\"occupied a racial middle ground within the otherwise unforgiving, binary caste system of white-over-black.\\" Though Italians were viewed as white for purposes of naturalization and voting, their social standing was that they represented a \\"problem at best.\\" Their racial status was impacted by their appearance and that they did not \\"act\\" white, engaging in manual labor ordinarily reserved for blacks. The trial of nineteen Italian immigrants for the murder of New Orleans police chief David Hennessy in 1890, which ended in the lynching of eleven of them by a white vigilante group, sparked debate in the press over Italians supposed racial characteristics. Italians continued to occupy a \\"middle ground in the racial order\\" through the 1920s. However, \\"color challenges were never sustained or systematic\\" when it came to Italians, who were \\"largely accepted as white by the widest variety of people and institutions\\" throughout the U.S. Even in the South, such as Louisiana, any attempts to disenfranchise them \\"failed miserably\\". North Africans in the United States Under the U.S. Census definition and U.S. federal agency, individuals with ancestry from North Africa are considered white. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations also explicitly define white as \\"original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.\\" In 2014, the Census proposed for comment a new racial category for Middle Eastern and North African Americans. The category requires approval by Congress. However, census officials have also received feedback that Middle Eastern or North African should be treated as an ethnicity (i.e., a linguistic or cultural group, similar to \\"Hispanic or Latino\\") rather than a racial category.NWX-US DEPT OF COMMERCE, Moderator: Michael Monroe, January 26, 2018. Most North Africans in the U.S. are of North African origin, BerCopts, Arabs, Arab-Berbers and Egyptians. They are among the more numerous Arab American group.

When Khusrau's marriage was arranged with her, an order was given that S'aid Khan Abdullah Khan and Mir Sadr Jahan should convey 100,000 rupees as sachaq to the Mirza's house by the way of Sihr baha. She was his favourite wife, and was the mother of his eldest son Dawar Bakhsh, and his second son Prince Buland Akhtar Mirza born on 11 March 1609, and died in infancy. Another of Khusrau's wives was the daughter of Jani Beg Tarkhan of Thatta. She was the sister of Mirza Ghazi Beg. The marriage was arranged by Khusrau's grandfather, Emperor Akbar. Another of his wives was the daughter of Muqim, son of Mihtar Fazil Rikabdar (stirrup holder). She was the mother of Prince Gurshasp Mirza born on 8 April 1616. Khusrau had a daughter Hoshmand Banu Begum, born in about 1605, and married to Prince Hoshang Mirza, son of Prince Daniyal Mirza. Rebellion and aftermath In 1605, the emperor Akbar died. Akbar had been deeply disappointed with Khusrau's father Jahangir. Perhaps due to this background, Khusrau rebelled against his father in 1606 to secure the throne for himself. Khusrau is captured and presented to Jahangir. Khusrau compelled to watch his supporters impaled Khusrau left Agra on April 6, 1606Majumdar, R.C. (ed.)(2007).

When Khusrau reached Taran Taran near Amritsar, he received the blessings of Guru Arjan Dev. Khusrau laid siege on Lahore, defended by Dilawar Khan. Jahangir soon reached Lahore with a large army and Khusrau was defeated in the battle of Bhairowal. He and his followers tried to flee towards Kabul but they were captured by Jahangir's army while crossing the Chenab.The Flight of Khusrau The Tuzk-e-Jahangiri Or Memoirs Of Jahangir, Alexander Rogers and Henry Beveridge.

He was seated in grand style on an elephant and paraded down Chandni Chowk, while on both sides of the narrow street, the noblemen and barons who had supported him were held at knife-point on raised platforms. As the elephant approached each such platform, the luckless supporter was impaled on a stake (through his bowels), while Khusrau was compelled to watch the grisly sight and listen to the screams and pleas of those who had supported him. This was repeated numerous times through the entire length of Chandni Chowk. The Mausoleum of Khusrau Mirza in Khusro Bagh, Allahabad Khusrau was then blinded (in 1607) and imprisoned in Agra. However, his eyesight was never completely lost. In 1616, he was handed over to Asaf Khan, the brother of his step-mother Nur Jehan. In 1620, he was handed over to his younger brother Prince Khurram (later known as emperor Shah Jahan), who incidentally was Asaf Khan's son-in-law. In 1622, Khusrau was killed on the orders of Prince Khurram.Mahajan V.D. (1991, reprint 2007) History of Medieval India, Part II, New Delhi: S.

Because of the involvement of the UII system in multiple biological systems such as the cardiovascular, nervous, endocrine, and renal, it represents a promising target for the development of new drugs. In humans, Urotensin-2 is encoded by the UTS2 gene.  Discovery  U-II was initially isolated from the neurosecretory system of the Goby fish (Gillichthys mirabilis). For many years it was thought that U-II does not exhibit significant effects in mammalian systems; a view quickly overturned when it was demonstrated that Goby U-II produces slow relaxation of mouse anococcygeus muscle, in addition to contraction of rat artery segments. In 1998, the genes for Pre-pro U-II were found in mammals proving that the peptide U-II did exist in mammals.  Structure  The U-II gene is located on chromosome 1p36. U-II peptide length varies between species due to the specific cleaving sites located at different spots depending on the species. In humans U-II length is 11 amino acids. The peptide sequence that is needed for biological function for both U-II and urotensin II-Related Peptide (URP) is known as the core. It is hexapeptide (-CYS-TYR-LYS-TRP-PHE-CYS-), and is connected at the two ends by a disulfide bond. Also just like URP the amino terminus can be modified without any loss in pharmacological activity suggesting that it is not needed for activation of the receptor. Unlike URP, U-II has an acidic amino acid (Glutamic or Aspartic) that precedes the core sequence. While the amino acid is not necessary for the activation of urotensin II receptor the fact that it is conserved in different species suggests that it has a biological function that has not been discovered.  Receptor  U-II is an agonist for the urotensin-II receptor which is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily activates the alpha subunit GŒ±q11. It activates PKC which then activates PLC which increases the intercellular calcium concentration. It is found in many peripheral tissues, blood vessels, and also the brainstem cholinergic neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT). It is also found in rat astrocytes.  Tissue localization  Pre-pro U-II in both humans and rats are primarily expressed in the motorneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord although it is also found in small amounts in other parts of the brain as well including the frontal lobe and the medulla oblongata. In humans U-II mRNA is also found in other peripheral tissues such as the heart, kidneys, adrenal gland, placenta, spleen, and thymus.  Function = Central nervous system  When injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) U-II causes an increase in the corticotropin releasing factor by activating the hypothalamic paraventricular neurons. This leads to increased plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormones and adrenaline. Rats and mice exhibit many stress related behaviors when injected with U-II which were tested by the elevated plus maze which measures anxiety- like effects,and the hole-board test which measures head dipping which is also an anxiety-like behavior. U-II when injected icv in rats also leads to cardiovascular responses including raising mean arterial pressure (MAP) and causing tachycardia. When the arcuate nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus, two different areas of the brain which are known to control blood pressure were injected with U-II simultaneously they caused an increase in blood pressure. When the two areas were injected separately it was discovered that U-II affected the excitatory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and the inhibitory neurons of the arcuate nucleus. U-II when injected icv in both rats and mice also stimulates locomotion in familiar environments. This experiment was also tested in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) where a stimulatory effect was also observed.. Depression-like behavior was also observed when U-II was injected in the brain by using the forced swim test and the tail suspension test which are used to compare molecules that are thought to cause anti-depressive-like effects. Orexigenic behavior which is increased appetite and thirst were also observed after icv injection of U-II in rats.  Peripheral tissue effects  U-II has a variety of effects on different tissues. In blood vessels it can cause contraction. In rat pancreas U-II inhibits insulin secretion. It also affects the kidneys including sodium transport, lipid and glucose metabolism, and natriuretic effects. It has been linked to cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, heart failure, renal dysfunction, and diabetes.

Gellately has very strict guidelines for what he will deem a genocide, and has had several televised debates regarding his somewhat controversial views. Gellately's most recent work is Stalin's Curse: Battling for Communism in War and Cold War (Knopf (March 5, 2013). Gellately recently published a set of original documents by Leon Goldensohn dealing with the 1945‚Äì46 Nuremberg trials of war criminals in The Nuremberg Interviews: An American Psychiatrist's Conversations With The Defendants and Witnesses (Alfred A.

Backing Hitler was chosen as a main selection for book clubs in North America and the United Kingdom. In the book Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, 1933‚Äì1945, Gellately argues that the Gestapo were not in fact all-pervasive and intrusive as they have been described. The Gestapo only numbered 32,000 for the entire population of Germany, and this clearly limited their impact. In the city of Hanover there were only 42 officers. Instead, Gellately says that the atmosphere of terror and fear was maintained by 'denunciations' from ordinary Germans, whereby they would inform any suspicious 'anti-Nazi' activity to the local Nazi authority. According to Gellately, these denunciations were the cause of most prosecutions, as in Saarbr√ºcken 87.5 per cent of cases of 'slander against the regime' came from denunciations. This diminished the Gestapo's role in maintaining fear and terror throughout the Third Reich, however they still proved to be a powerful instrument for Hitler and continued to provide the security apparatus needed for the Nazi Regime. His first book was The Politics of Economic Despair: Shopkeepers in German Politics, 1890‚Äì1914 (London, 1974). In 1991 he published The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy, 1933‚Äì1945 (Oxford University Press). It has been translated into German and Spanish. In addition, Gellately has co-edited a volume of essays with Russian specialist Sheila Fitzpatrick, Accusatory Practices: Denunciation in Modern European History, 1789‚Äì1989 (University of Chicago Press, 1997). With his colleague Nathan Stoltzfus (also at Florida State University) he co-edited a collection called Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany (Princeton University Press, 2001). With Ben Kiernan, Director of the Genocide Studies program at Yale, he recently co-edited The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective (Cambridge University Press, 2003). Professor Gellately has won numerous research awards, including grants from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Many of the books written or edited by him are used as textbooks in college classrooms across the United States of America.

Halobacterium salinarum is an extremely halophilic marine obligate aerobic archaeon. Despite its name, this is not a bacterium, but rather a member of the domain Archaea. It is found in salted fish, hides, hypersaline lakes, and salterns. As these salterns reach the minimum salinity limits for extreme halophiles, their waters become purple or reddish color due to the high densities of halophilic Archaea. H. salinarum has also been found in high-salt food such as salt pork, marine fish, and sausages. The ability of H. salinarum to survive at such high salt concentrations has led to its classification as an extremophile.  Cell morphology and metabolism  Halobacteria are single-celled, rod-shaped microorganisms that are among the most ancient forms of life and appeared on Earth billions of years ago. The membrane consists of a single lipid monolayer surrounded by an S-layer. The S-layer is made of a cell-surface glycoprotein, which accounts for approximately 50% of the cell surface proteins. These proteins form a lattice in the membrane. Sulfate residues are abundant on the glycan chains of the glycoprotein, giving it a negative charge. The negative charge is believed to stabilize the lattice in high-salt conditions. Amino acids are the main source of chemical energy for H. salinarum, particularly arginine and aspartate, though they are able to metabolize other amino acids, as well. H. salinarum have been reported to not be able to grow on sugars, and therefore need to encode enzymes capable of performing gluconeogenesis to create sugars. Although \\"H. salinarum\\" is unable to catabolize glucose, the transcription factor TrmB has been proven to regulate the gluconeogenic production of sugars found on the S-layer glycoprotein.  Adaptation to extreme conditions = High salt  To survive in extremely salty environments, this archaeon‚Äîas with other halophilic Archaeal species‚Äîutilizes compatible solutes (in particular potassium chloride) to reduce osmotic stress. Potassium levels are not at equilibrium with the environment, so H. salinarum expresses multiple active transporters which pump potassium into the cell. At extremely high salt concentrations protein precipitation will occur. To prevent the salting out of proteins, H. salinarum encodes mainly acidic proteins. The average isoelectric point of H. salinarum proteins is 5.03. These highly acidic proteins are overwhelmingly negative in charge and are able to remain in solution even at high salt concentrations.  Low oxygen and phototrophy Chemiosmotic coupling between the sun energy, bacteriorhodopsin and phosphorylation by ATP synthase (chemical energy) during photosynthesis in Halobacterium salinarum (syn. H. halobium). The archaeal cell wall is omitted. H. salinarum can grow to such densities in salt ponds that oxygen is quickly depleted. Though it is an obligate aerobe, it is able to survive in low-oxygen conditions by utilizing light-energy. H. salinarum express the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin which acts as a light-driven proton pump. It consists of two parts, the 7-transmembrane protein, bacterioopsin, and the light-sensitive cofactor, retinal. Upon absorption of a photon, retinal changes conformation, causing a conformational change in the bacterioopsin protein which drives proton transport. The proton gradient which is formed can then be used to generate chemical energy by ATP synthase. To obtain more oxygen H. salinarum produce gas vesicles, which allow them to float to the surface where oxygen levels are higher and more light is available.Oren, A., Ecology of extremely halophilic microorganisms, Vreeland, R.H., Hochstein, L.I., editors, The Biology of Halophilic Bacteria, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Florida, 1993, p. 25-54. These vesicles are complex structures made of proteins encoded by at least 14 genes. Gas vesicles were first discovered in H. salinarum in 1967.  UV protection  There is little protection from the Sun in salt ponds, so H. salinarum are often exposed to high amounts of UV radiation. To compensate, they have evolved a sophisticated DNA repair mechanism. The genome encodes DNA repair enzymes homologous to those in both bacteria and eukaryotes. This allows H. salinarum to repair damage to DNA faster and more efficiently than other organisms and allows them to be much more UV tolerant. Bacterioruberin H. salinarum is responsible for the bright pink or red appearance of the Dead Sea and other bodies of salt water. This red color is due primarily to the presence of bacterioruberin, a 50 carbon carotenoid alcohol (polyol) pigment present within the membrane of H. salinarum. The primary role of bacterioruberin in the cell is to protect against DNA damage incurred by UV light. This protection is not, however, due to the ability of bacterioruberin to absorb UV light. Bacterioruberin protects the DNA by acting as an antioxidant, rather than directly blocking UV light.Ide, H., Takeshi, S., Hiroaki, T., Studies on the antioxidation activity of bacterioruberin, Urakami Found Mem, 1998, 6:127-33. It is able to protect the cell from reactive oxygen species produced from exposure to UV by acting as a target. The bacterioruberin radical produced is less reactive than the initial radical, and will likely react with another radical, resulting in termination of the radical chain reaction.Saito, T., Miyabe, Y., Ide, H., Yamamoto, O., Hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of bacterioruberin, Radiat Phys Chem, 1997, 50(3):267-9. Protection against ionizing radiation and desiccation H. salinarum is polyploid and highly resistant to ionizing radiation and desiccation, conditions that induce DNA double-strand breaks. Although chromosomes are initially shattered into many fragments, complete chromosomes are regenerated by making use of over-lapping fragments. Regeneration occurs by a process involving DNA single-stranded binding protein, and is likely a form of homologous recombinational repair.  Genome  Whole genome sequences are available for two strains of H. salinarum, NRC-1 and R1. The Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome consists of 2,571,010 base pairs on one large chromosome and two mini-chromosomes. The genome encodes 2,360 predicted proteins. The large chromosome is very G-C rich (68%). High GC-content of the genome increases stability in extreme environments. Whole proteome comparisons show the definite archaeal nature of this halophile with additional similarities to the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and other bacteria.  As a model organism  H. salinarum is as easy to culture as E. coli and serves as an excellent model system. Methods for gene replacement and systematic knockout have been developed, so H. salinarum is an ideal candidate for the study of archaeal genetics and functional genomics.  For hydrogen production  Hydrogen production using H. salinarum coupled to a hydrogenase donor like E. coli are reported in literature.  Oldest DNA ever recovered  A sample of a close genetic relative of H. salinarum encapsulated inments estimated at 121 million years old. Oddly, the material had been also recovered earlier, but it proved to be so similar to the modern descendants that scientists had believed the earlier samples were contaminated. Scientists have previously recovered similar genetic material from the Michigan Basin, the same region where the latest discovery was made. But that DNA, discovered in a salt-cured buffalo hide in the 1930s, was so similar to that of modern microbes that many scientists believed the samples had been contaminated. The curing salt had been derived from a mine in Saskatchewan, the site of the most recent sample described by Jong Soo Park of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Russell Vreeland of Ancient Biomaterials Institute of West Chester University in Pennsylvania, USA, performed an analysis of all known halophilic bacteria, which yielded the finding that Park's bacteria contained six segments of DNA never seen before in the halophiles. Vreeland also tracked down the buffalo skin and determined that the salt came from the same mine as Park's sample. He has also discovered an even older halophile estimated at 250 million years old in New Mexico. However, his findings date the crystal surrounding the bacteria, and DNA analysis suggests the bacteria themselves are likely to be less ancient.

It is marketed as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but reviews of clinical trials, including those conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, found it ineffective for this purpose. Uses and research  Saw palmetto extract is commonly sold as a dietary supplement intended to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) ‚Äî also called prostate gland enlargement ‚Äî which is a common condition in elderly men. An enlarged prostate may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, such as inhibiting urine flow from the bladder, pain in the pelvis, headache, or hair loss. Saw palmetto extract has been studied in clinical trials as a possible treatment for people with prostate cancer and for men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH. As of 2018, there is insufficient scientific evidence that saw palmetto extract is effective for treating cancer or BPH and its symptoms. One 2016 review of clinical studies with a standardized extract of saw palmetto (called Permixon) found that the extract was safe and may be effective for relieving BPH-induced urinary symptoms compared against a placebo.  Folk medicine Saw palmetto was used in folk medicine to treat coughs or other disorders. Precautions and contraindications=Children The use of saw palmetto extract is not recommended in children under 12 years old because it may affect the metabolism of androgen and estrogen hormones. Pregnancy and lactation Saw palmetto extract should not be used during pregnancy. The effects of saw palmetto extract on androgen and estrogen metabolism can potentially impair fetal genital development. Saw palmetto extract should also be avoided during breastfeeding due to a lack of available information. Surgery and bleeding risk In a case report, a patient taking saw palmetto extract had increased bleeding time during surgery. Bleeding time returned to normal after stopping taking the herb. One clinical trial pre-treated prostate surgery patients with saw palmetto for five weeks prior to the surgery, because there was evidence from earlier literature that such pre-treatment reduced operative bleeding. The trial reported no improvement compared to placebo. As a general rule surgeons should ask patients to discontinue dietary supplements prior to scheduled surgery. Interactions Saw palmetto extract has extensive interactions with other medications. It may decrease the effectiveness of estrogen products by reducing estrogen levels in the body via its antiestrogenic effects. It can interfere with the use of birth control pills that contain estrogen as an active ingredient. As a result, it is recommended that an additional form of birth control, such as a condom, be used to prevent pregnancy in patients taking birth control pills with saw palmetto extract. In addition, saw palmetto extract can also interfere with hormone replacement therapy by reducing the effectiveness of estrogen pills. The combination of saw palmetto extract with estrogen products should be used with caution. When used in combination with an anticoagulant or antiplatelet drug, saw palmetto extract can increase the risk of bleeding by enhancing the anticoagulation or antiplatelet effects. Some examples of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs include aspirin, clopidogrel, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and warfarin.

History Albania had been under Ottoman rule from around 1478. The Great Powers recognized the independence of Albania in the Treaty of London in May 1913 and the Principality was established on February 21, 1914. The Great Powers selected Prince William of Wied, a nephew of Queen Elisabeth of Romania, to become the sovereign of the newly independent Albania. A formal offer was made by 18 Albanian delegates representing the 18 districts of Albania on February 21, 1914, an offer which he accepted. Outside of Albania William was styled prince, but in Albania he was referred to as king so as not to seem inferior to the king of Montenegro. The first government under the rule of the House of Wied was a kind of \\"princes privy council\\" because of its members, who were representatives of the Albanian nobility: Prince Turhan Pasha P√´rmeti (former Governor of Crete and ambassador of the Ottoman Empire at Saint Petersburg), Aziz Pasha Vrioni, Prince Bib Doda of Gjomarkaj-Mirdita, Prince Essad Pasha Toptani, Prince George Adamidi bey Frash√´ri, Mihal Turtulli bey Koritza, and others. The Principality of Albania in 1914. Prince William arrived in Albania at his provisional capital of Durr√´s on March 7, 1914, along with the Royal family. The security of Albania was to be provided by an International Gendarmerie commanded by Dutch officers. William left Albania on September 3, 1914, following a pan-Islamic revolt initiated by Essad Pasha and later headed by Haxhi Qamili, the latter the military commander of the \\"Muslim State of Central Albania\\" centered in Tirana. William never renounced his claim to the throne. World War I World War I interrupted all government activities in Albania, and the country was split into a number of regional governments. Political chaos engulfed Albania after the outbreak of World War I. Surrounded by insurgents in Durr√´s, Prince William departed the country in September 1914, just six months after arriving, and subsequently joined the German army and served on the Eastern Front. The Albanian people split along religious and tribal lines after the prince's departure. Muslims demanded a Muslim prince and looked to Ottoman Empire as the protector of the privileges they had enjoyed, hence many beys and clan chiefs, recognized no superior authority. In late October 1914, Greek forces entered Albania in the Protocol of Corfu's recognized Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. Italy occupied Vlor√´, and Serbia and Montenegro occupied parts of northern Albania until a Central Powers offensive scattered the Serbian army, which was evacuated by the French to Thessaloniki. Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian forces then occupied about two-thirds of the country. Under the secret Treaty of London signed in April 1915, Triple Entente powers promised Italy that it would gain Vlor√´ and nearby lands and a protectorate over Albania in exchange for entering the war against Austria-Hungary. Serbia and Montenegro were promised much of northern Albania, and Greece was promised much of the country's southern half. The treaty was to leave a tiny Albanian state that would be represented by Italy in its relations with the other major powers, thus basically would have no foreign policy. In September 1918, the Entente forces broke through the Central Powers' lines north of Thessaloniki, and within days Austro-Hungarian forces began to withdraw from Albania. When the war ended on November 11, 1918, Italy's army had occupied most of Albania, Serbia held much of the country's northern mountains, Greece occupied a sliver of land within Albania's 1913 borders; and French forces occupied Kor√ß√´ and Shkod√´r as well as other regions with sizable Albanian populations such as Kosovo, remained part of Serbia. Re-emergence Albania's political confusion continued in the wake of World War I. The country lacked a single recognized government, and Albanians feared, with justification, that Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece would succeed in extinguishing Albania's independence and carve up the country. Italian forces controlled Albanian political activity in the areas they occupied. The Serbs, who largely dictated Yugoslavia's foreign policy, strove to take over northern Albania, and the Greeks sought to control southern Albania. A delegation sent by a postwar Albanian National Assembly that met at Durr√´s in December 1918 defended Albanian interests at the Paris Peace Conference, but the conference denied Albania official representation. The National Assembly, anxious to keep Albania intact, expressed willingness to accept Italian protection and even an Italian prince as a ruler so long as it would mean Albania did not lose territory. Serbian troops conducted actions in Albanian- populated border areas, while Albanian guerrillas operated in both Serbia and Montenegro. In January 1920, at the Paris Peace Conference, negotiators from France, Britain, and Greece agreed to divide Albania among Yugoslavia, Italy, and Greece as a diplomatic expedient aimed at finding a compromise solution to the territorial conflict between Italy and Yugoslavia. The deal was done behind the Albanians' backs and in the absence of a United States negotiator. Members of a second Albanian National Assembly held at Lushnj√´ in January 1920 rejected the partition plan and warned that Albanians would take up arms to defend their country's independence and territorial integrity. The Lushnj√´ National Assembly appointed a four-man regency to rule the country. A bicameral parliament was also created, in which an elected lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies (with one deputy for every 12,000 people in Albania and one for the Albanian community in the United States), appointed members of its own ranks to an upper chamber, the Senate. In February 1920, the government moved to Tirana, which became Albania's capital. One month later, in March 1920, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson intervened to block the Paris agreement. The United States underscored its support for Albania's independence by recognizing an official Albanian representative to Washington, and on December 17, 1920, the League of Nations recognized Albania's sovereignty by admitting it as a full member. The country's borders, however, remained unsettled. Albania's new government campaigned to end Italy's occupation of the country and encouraged peasants to harass Italian forces. In September 1920, after the Battle of Vlora, where Italian-occupied Vlor√´ was besieged by Albanian forces, Rome abandoned its claims on Albania under the Treaty of London and withdrew its forces from all of Albania except Sazan Island at the mouth of Vlor√´ Bay.Albania and King Zog: independence, republic and monarchy 1908-1939 Volume 1 of Albania in the twentieth century, Owen Pearson Volume 1 of Albania and King Zog, Owen Pearson Author Owen Pearson Edition illustrated Publisher I.B.Tauris, 2004 , Mirdita Republic Yugoslavia continued to pursue a predatory policy toward Albania, and after Albanian tribesmen clashed with Yugoslav forces occupying the northern part of the country, Yugoslav troops escalated their campaign in the area. Belgrade then backed a disgruntled Geg clan chief, Gjon Markagjoni, who led his Roman Catholic Mirdit√´ tribesmen in a rebellion against the regency and parliament. Markagjoni proclaimed the founding of an independent \\"Republic of Mirdita\\". Finally, in November 1921, Yugoslav troops invaded Albanian territory beyond the areas they were already occupying. The League of Nations dispatched a commission composed of representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan that reaffirmed Albania's 1913 borders. Yugoslavia complained bitterly but had no choice but to withdraw its troops. The Republic of Mirdita disappeared. Political situation Standard of the Sovereign Prince William of Albania Sophie of Albania Carol Victor of Albania Interwar Albanian governments appeared and disappeared in rapid succession. Between July and December 1921 alone, the premiership changed hands five times. Congress of Lushnj√´ The Congress of Lushnj√´ () was held in five sessions on January 27-January 31, 1920, in Lushnj√´ by Albanian nationalists and had as its goal the study of the Albanian situation and the measures to be adopted in order to save Albania from being partitioned among other countries after World War I. The Congress was held in the house of Kaso Fuga and it comprised delegates from all of Albania. Aqif Pash√´ Elbasani was elected as speaker of the Congress as he was held in high regard as a great patriot. It established the High Council (K√´shilli i Lart√´), the National Council (K√´shillin Komb√´tar), and moved the capital from Lushnj√´ to Tirana. The High Council was made up of Luigj Bum√ßi, Aqif Pash√´ Elbasani, Abdi Toptani, and Dr. Mihal Turtulli who would perform the function of the leaders of the new Albanian state, whereas the National Council would function as the Parliament. The new government that was created was: Sulejman Delvina - Prime minister Ahmet Zogu was elected Minister of Internal Affairs Mehmet Konica - Minister of Foreign Affairs Hoxh√´ Kadria - Minister of Justice Ndoc √áoba - Minister of Finance, Sotir Pe√ßi - Minister of Education Ali Riza Kolonja - Minister of War Eshref Frash√´ri - General Director of World Affairs Idhomene Kosturi - General Director of the Post-Telegraph Agency. Political parties Albania's first political parties emerged only after World War I. Even more than in other parts of the Balkans, political parties were evanescent gatherings centered on prominent persons who created temporary alliances to achieve their personal aims. The major conservative party, the Progressive Party, attracted some northern clan chiefs and prominent Muslim landholders of southern Albania whose main platform was firm opposition to any agricultural reform program that would transfer their lands to the peasantry. The country's biggest landowner, Shefqet Bej V√´rlaci, led the Progressive Party. The Popular Party's ranks included the reform-minded Orthodox bishop of Durr√´s, Fan Noli, who was imbued with Western ideas at his alma mater, Harvard University,Stephan Thernstrom Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups Library of Congress 1980 page 26 and had even translated Shakespeare and Ibsen into Albanian.Olive Classe \\"Albania\\" Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English, Volume 1. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers Library of Congress page 37 The Popular Party also included Ahmed Zogu, the twenty-four- year-old son of the chief of the Mati, a Northern Albanian clan. The future King Zog drew his support from some northern clans and kept an armed gang in his service , but many Geg clan leaders refused to support either main party. The Popular Party's head, Xhafer Ypi, formed a government in December 1921 with Noli as foreign minister and Zogu as internal affairs minister, but Noli resigned soon after Zogu resorted to repression in an attempt to disarm the lowland Albanians despite the fact that bearing arms was a traditional custom. Zogu government When the government's enemies attacked Tirana in early 1922, Zogu stayed in the capital and, with the support of the British ambassador, repulsed the assault. He took over the premiership later in the year and turned his back on the Popular Party by announcing his engagement to the daughter of the Progressive Party leader, Shefqet Verlaci. Zogu's prot√©g√©s organized themselves into the Government Party. Noli and other Western- oriented leaders formed the Opposition Party of Democrats, which attracted all of Zogu's many personal enemies, ideological opponents, and people left unrewarded by his political machine. Ideologically, the Democrats included a broad sweep of people who advocated everything from conservative Islam to Noli's dreams of rapid modernization. Opposition to Zogu was formidable. Orthodox peasants in Albania's southern lowlands loathed Zogu because he supported the Muslim landowners' efforts to block land reform; Shkod√´r's citizens felt shortchanged because their city did not become Albania's capital, and nationalists were dissatisfied because Zogu's government did not press Albania's claims to Kosovo or speak up more energetically for the rights of the ethnic Albanian minorities in former Yugoslavia (Kosovo, southern Serbia and Vardar Macedonia) and Greece. Zogu's party handily won elections for a National Assembly in early 1924. Zogu soon stepped aside, however, handing over the premiership to Verlaci in the wake of a financial scandal and an assassination attempt by a young radical that left Zogu wounded. The opposition withdrew from the assembly after the leader of a radical youth organization, Avni Rustemi, was murdered in the street outside the parliament building. Noli's government Noli's supporters blamed the murder on Zogu's Mati clansmen, who continued to practice blood vengeance. After the walkout, discontent mounted, and in June 1924 a peasant-backed insurgency had won control of Tirana. Noli became prime minister, and Zogu fled to Yugoslavia. Fan Noli, an idealist, rejected demands for new elections on the grounds that Albania needed a \\"paternal\\" government. In a manifesto describing his government's program, Noli called for abolishing feudalism, resisting Italian domination, and establishing a Western-style constitutional government. Scaling back the bureaucracy, strengthening local government, assisting peasants, throwing Albania open to foreign investment, and improving the country's bleak transportation, public health, and education facilities filled out the Noli government's overly ambitious agenda. Noli encountered resistance to his program from people who had helped him oust Zogu, and he never attracted the foreign aid necessary to carry out his reform plans. Noli criticized the League of Nations for failing to settle the threat facing Albania on its land borders. Under Fan Noli, the government set up a special tribunal that passed death sentences, in absentia, on Zogu, Verlaci, and others and confiscated their property. In Yugoslavia Zogu recruited a mercenary army, and Belgrade furnished the Albanian leader with weapons, about 1,000 Yugoslav army regulars, and Russian White √©migr√©s to mount an invasion that the Serbs hoped would bring them disputed areas along the border. After Noli's regime decided to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, a bitter enemy of the Serbian ruling family, Belgrade began making wild allegations that the Albanian regime was about to embrace Bolshevism. On December 13, 1924, Zogu's Yugoslav-backed army crossed into Albanian territory. By Christmas Eve, Zogu had reclaimed the capital, and Noli and his government had fled to Italy. But his government lasted just six months, and Ahmet Zogu returned with another coup d'√©tat and regained the control, changing the political situation and abolishing principality. Economy Upon termination of Albania from Turkey in 1912, as in all other fields, the customs administration continued its operation under legislation approved specifically for the procedure. With the new laws were issued for the operation of customs duty was 11% of the value of goods imported and 1% on the value of those exported. At the time of the interim government of Vlora, in 1912‚Äì1913 there has been no other change on this duty, except the import tax on tobacco, which at the time was added up to 30%, which became an order of the Ministry of Finance at the time, but that does not say that on which the law rested. For the period 1913‚Äì1914, when the government was in power Durr√´s, although lacking formal notices to all customs fees, it is known that there was nothing changed from that of 1912‚Äì1913. So, until 1914 there was no change in customs regulations. Similarly, from 1914 until 1918 that the First World War continued and Albania was occupied sections by foreign powers, customs regulations functioned under laws that implement the relevant commands to foreign armies that were present in Albania ( Italians, French, Austro- Hungarians, etc..), which occasionally modified. Commands Austro-Hungarian armies and French (with the exception of any modification), made no change in the applicable customs legislation inherited from the government of Durr√´s 1914, while the Austro-Hungarian command center in Shkodra, in 1916 brought a decision on the curb, which consisted of eight articles. In the first article stated: \\"The word contraband, we learn that the sale of cntrabanded things, causes damage on the Treasury or the people. Damtime trigger \\". Likewise, the French command of Korca took a decision to increase the fee (trails) customs. This decision, which was printed in Albanian and French, consisting of 11 articles and was signed by French General H. Salle, commander of troops in who were installed on Maliq. According to the state archives found in Korca, after two years (15 March 1920), this command issued another regulation, known as \\"Regulation Oktrov√´s\\" and was signed by the commander of the Albanian borders, Cretin. To regulate the customs service, after 1920, began functioning as separate offices in Vlora (Director customs), Kor√ß√´ (Director of Oktrov√´s) in Shkodra and Lezha with customs Kryedrejtori. The latter, in 1920, moved to Durr√´s and Tirana later. It kryedrejtori customs headed by Ahmed Bori√ßi and operated independent from the Ministry of Finance, was abolished in 1923. Since 1920, when the government came to power out of Lushnjes Congress until 1934 (at which time the study was done Hajj Shkoza author), Albanian national administration, along with the development of all its activities in different branches economy, was also involved in the organization of the customs system. As originally drafted specific provisions on exports of grain and other products to local products, something which once made the decisions of the Council of Ministers and times of special laws decree issued by the government (in cases when the country needed bread due to the lack of grain). But when the products were successful and met all the needs of the country, farmers and grain traders were selling these exported out of them. From 1912 to 1939, the Albanian customs legislation was constantly being improved, reaching the most advanced countries of the West. It did at the time of our trade with foreign countries take the unprecedented growth. This continued well into the war years 1939‚Äì1944, after Italy, for propaganda purposes, liberalized trade with Albania, enabling you to our country pouring wholesale goods. As a result, even to this day remember the phrase: \\"as long Abundance of Italy\\". Social conditions Extraordinarily undeveloped, the Albania that emerged after World War I was home to something fewer than a million people divided into three major religious groups and two distinct classes: those people who owned land and claimed semifeudal privileges and those who did not. The landowners had always held the principal ruling posts in the country's central and southern regions, but many of them were steeped in the same conservatism that brought decay to the Ottoman Empire. The landowning elite expected that they would continue to enjoy precedence, but the country's peasants were beginning to dispute the landed aristocracy's control. In northern Albania, the government directly controlled only Shkod√´r and its environs. The highland clans were suspicious of a constitutional government claiming to legislate in the interests of the country as a whole, and the Roman Catholic Church became the principal link between Tirana and the tribesmen despite the Muslim religious affiliation of most of the population. In many instances, administrative communications were addressed to priests for circulation among their parishioners. Religion During this period Albanian religions got independence. The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople recognized the autocephaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church after a meeting of the country's Albanian Orthodox congregations in Berat in August 1922. The most energetic reformers in Albania came from the Orthodox population who wanted to see Albania move quickly away from its Turkish-ruled past, during which Christians made up the underclass. Albania's conservative Sunni Muslim community broke its last ties with Constantinople in 1923, formally declaring that there had been no caliph since Muhammad himself and that Muslim Albanians pledged primary allegiance to their native country. The Muslims also banned polygamy and allowed women to choose whether or not to wear a veil.

Sindhi poetry contains two main original forms of verse, such as bait and Waei. Bait slightly resembles with form Dohas and Sorthas, moreover also influenced by Persian forms like Ghazal, Mathnavi, Rubai, and Kaafi. Since the 1940s, Sindhi poetry has incorporated broader influences including the sonnet and blank verse. Soon after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, these forms were reinforced by Triolet, Haiku, Renga and Tanka etc. At present, these forms continue to co-exist, albeit in a varying degree, with Azad Nazm having an edge over them all.

It is the conjugate prior of a normal distribution with unknown mean and precision.Bernardo & Smith (1993, pages 136, 268, 434) Definition For a pair of random variables, (X,T), suppose that the conditional distribution of X given T is given by : X\\\\mid T \\\\sim N(\\\\mu,1 /(\\\\lambda T)) \\\\,! , meaning that the conditional distribution is a normal distribution with mean \\\\mu and precision \\\\lambda T ‚Äî equivalently, with variance 1 / (\\\\lambda T) . Suppose also that the marginal distribution of T is given by :T \\\\mid \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Gamma}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta), where this means that T has a gamma distribution. Here Œª, Œ± and Œ≤ are parameters of the joint distribution. Then (X,T) has a normal-gamma distribution, and this is denoted by : (X,T) \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{NormalGamma}(\\\\mu,\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\beta). Properties=Probability density function The joint probability density function of (X,T) is : f(x,\\\\tau\\\\mid\\\\mu,\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{\\\\beta^\\\\alpha \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\, \\\\tau^{\\\\alpha-\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\,e^{-\\\\beta\\\\tau}\\\\exp\\\\left( -\\\\frac{ \\\\lambda \\\\tau (x- \\\\mu)^2}{2}\\\\right) Marginal distributions By construction, the marginal distribution of \\\\tau is a gamma distribution, and the conditional distribution of x given \\\\tau is a Gaussian distribution. The marginal distribution of x is a three-parameter non-standardized Student's t-distribution with parameters ( u, \\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2)=(2\\\\alpha, \\\\mu, \\\\beta/(\\\\lambda\\\\alpha)). Exponential family The normal-gamma distribution is a four-parameter exponential family with natural parameters \\\\alpha-1/2, -\\\\beta-\\\\lambda\\\\mu^2/2, \\\\lambda\\\\mu, -\\\\lambda/2 and natural statistics \\\\ln\\\\tau, \\\\tau, \\\\tau x, \\\\tau x^2.

However, a third \\"interaction term\\" is needed because the two sets of squared deviations were computed with respect to different means, and hence the sum of the two underestimates the actual total squared deviation. As a consequence, if one has a prior mean of \\\\mu_0 from n_\\\\mu samples and a prior precision of \\\\tau_0 from n_\\\\tau samples, the prior distribution over \\\\mu and \\\\tau is : \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\tau,\\\\mu \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\operatorname{NormalGamma} \\\\left(\\\\mu_0, n_\\\\mu , \\\\frac{n_\\\\tau}{2}, \\\\frac{n_\\\\tau}{2 \\\\tau_0}\\\\right) and after observing n samples with mean \\\\mu and variance s, the posterior probability is : \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\tau,\\\\mu \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\text{NormalGamma}\\\\left( \\\\frac{n_\\\\mu \\\\mu_0 + n \\\\mu}{n_\\\\mu +n}, n_\\\\mu +n ,\\\\frac{1}{2}(n_\\\\tau+n), \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{n_\\\\tau}{\\\\tau_0} + n s + \\\\frac{n_\\\\mu n (\\\\mu-\\\\mu_0)^2}{n_\\\\mu+n}\\\\right) \\\\right) Note that in some programming languages, such as Matlab, the gamma distribution is implemented with the inverse definition of \\\\beta, so the fourth argument of the Normal-Gamma distribution is 2 \\\\tau_0 /n_\\\\tau.  Generating normal-gamma random variates  Generation of random variates is straightforward: # Sample \\\\tau from a gamma distribution with parameters \\\\alpha and \\\\beta # Sample x from a normal distribution with mean \\\\mu and variance 1/(\\\\lambda \\\\tau)  Related distributions  * The normal-inverse-gamma distribution is essentially the same distribution parameterized by variance rather than precision * The normal-exponential-gamma distribution Notes References  * Bernardo, J.M.; Smith, A.F.M.

Rider Haggard. It was first published serially in the weekly magazine Tit- Bits, between December 1893 and August 1894; the first edition in book form was published in London by Longman in October, 1894. It was reprinted in December, 1973 by Ballantine Books as the sixty-third paperback volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. Plot The People of the Mist is the tale of a British adventurer seeking wealth in the wilds of Africa, finding romance, and discovering a lost race and its monstrous god. The penniless Leonard Outram attempts to redress the undeserved loss of his family estates and his fianc√©e by seeking his fortune in Africa. In the course of his adventures, he and his Zulu companion Otter save a young Portuguese woman, Juanna Rodd, together with her nursemaid Soa, from slavery. Leonard and Juanna are plainly attracted to each other, but prone to bickering, and their romance is impeded by the watchful and jealous Soa. The protagonists seek the legendary People of the Mist, said to possess a fabulous hoard of jewels. On finding them, they immediately become embroiled in the turbulent political affairs of the lost race, which is driven by a power struggle between its king and the priests of its giant crocodile god. The heroic Outram can do little more than react to events. The action climaxes in a hair-raising escape by tobogganing a large flat stone down a steep glacier. Per ardua ad astra The motto of the Royal Air Force and other Commonwealth air forces, first adopted a generation after publication, has been attributed to a passage from the book.

Building control systems include those electrical and mechanical systems that operate inside a building, including Heating and Cooling (HVAC), Security, Power Management, and Life/Safety Alarms that are in nearly all buildings as well as the myriad of special purpose systems that may be tied to particular buildings such as A/V Event Management, Theatre Lighting, Medical Gas Distribution, Fume Hoods, and many others. oBIX is a web services interface because it does not necessarily allow deep interactions with the underlying control systems. This interface can enable communications between enterprise applications and embedded building systems as well as between two embedded building systems. Facilities and their operations to be managed as full participants in knowledge-based businesses. oBIX is being developed within OASIS, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. Version 1.0 was completed as a committee standard in December 2006.  Background  Presently most mechanical and electrical systems are provided with embedded digital controls (DDC). Most of these devices are low cost and not enabled for TCP/IP. They are installed with dedicated communications wiring. Larger DDC controllers provide network communications for these dedicated controllers. There are many well established binary protocols (BACnet, LonTalk, Modbus, DALI) that are used on these dedicated networks in addition to numerous proprietary protocols. While these binary protocols can be used over TCP/IP networks - they have challenges with routers, firewalls, security, and compatibility with other network applications. There is an added challenge in that the industry is split between several largely incompatible protocols. Because oBIX integrates with the enterprise, it enables mechanical and electrical control systems to provide continuous visibility of operational status and performance. By exposing these operations using web services, it enables owners and tenants to use the full array of standard databases and OLAP tools to analyse their performance. oBIX enables facilities operators, owners and tenants to make decisions based on a fully integrated consideration of all life-cycle, environmental, cost, and performance factors.  Scope  oBIX provides a publicly available web services interface specification that can be used to obtain data in a simple and secure manner from HVAC, access control, utilities, and other building automation systems, and to provide data exchange between facility systems and enterprise applications. Release 1 provides a normalized representation for three of elements common to control systems: * Points: representing a single scalar value and its status ‚Äì typically these map to sensors, actuators, or configuration variables like a setpoint. * Alarming: modeling, routing, and acknowledgment of alarms. Alarms indicate a condition which requires notification of either a user or another application. * Histories: modeling and querying of time sampled point data. Typically edge devices collect a time stamped history of point values which can be fed into higher level applications for analysis. oBIX 1.0 provides a low level object model which can be extended during implementation. While points are directly addressable (and thereby settable), direct interaction with the points requires too much knowledge of the underlying control system for the enterprise developer. The underlying points can be aggregated, the results named, alarm levels set, and histories begun using the oBIX contract. If oBIX exposes a low level object model for control systems, oBIX contracts create the higher level type libraries that most programmers actually want to work with.  Uses of oBIX = Tenant interactions  To keep a public space open in the evening may require a range of calls to different organizations within a building, each initiating an interaction with a separate building control system. To schedule a public meeting tonight from 7:00 to 9:00, the organizer may have to: * Call Security to warn the guard, and keep the (1) Access Control System working in day-time mode until 9:30. The guard may also need to disable the (2) Intrusion Detection System during that period. * Call Maintenance to make sure the room's (3) Environmental Controls are set properly for the event. This may include over-cooling (or heating) the room in advance to make sure that the room will be comfortable when filled with the anticipated numbers of callers. * Call the media support group to make sure the (4) A/V Event Management system is properly warmed up before the event, In an oBIX-enabled building, these features are accomplished by instead sending an iCalendar meeting invitation to the room and/or its support systems.  Emergency response  The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a standard increasingly used for relaying information from various agencies to the public and to police and first responders. One challenge that public notification faces is that the traditional Emergency Broadcasting System for transmitting information over the radio is now much less effective, now that the public is tuned instead to personal media players such as the iPod. New versions of these protocols anticipate, for example, direct texting of all cell phones in range of a given cell tower or set of cell towers. In a similar manner, current proposals suggest direct messaging to Intelligent Buildings to invoke named oBIX contracts, with effects ranging from temporary user security elevation, to initiating process shut down, to notifying in-building warning systems to read messages aloud. The Open Geospatial Consortium anticipates Emergency Responders being able to access certain classes of geo-tagged sensor information from buildings from within their maps to improve situational awareness.  Emerging power markets  The GridWise Architecture Council envisions an open market or Power Providers, Transmission, Distribution, and Customer Agents negotiating freely for live power contracts based on instantaneous demand/response. The ongoing installation across the US of Electric Meters able to provide time-of-day-metering is one step to enabling this. Another is the development of Intelligent Buildings able to negotiate with the grid. These grid negotiations are likely to be of two forms. (1) An intelligent agent residing in the building, and negotiating with the building tenants and their business processes negotiates set building system operating postures. (2) An external agent hired by the building tenants aggregates demand across multiple buildings and buys power on their behalf. Markets based on these interactions are considered to be key to creating market conditions to drive rapid innovation in on-site power storage and generation technologies.

Biography Samuel Hughes was born in Trentham, Staffordshire, England, the son of a bricklayer. In the mid-19th century the ophicleide was the bass-baritone instrument of the brass family, replacing the serpent and in turn being replaced by the euphonium. It was a keyed instrument (unlike the serpent), but without valves (unlike the euphonium). Hughes began his career playing the ophicleide in one of the newly popular brass bands, the Cyfarthfa Brass Band in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. He played with the band from the mid-1850s to about 1860. In 1860 the band won the national contest at The Crystal Palace, but Hughes was no longer with them. He also played with Louis Antoine Jullien's orchestra. There he became a star, known especially for his ophicleide solo of \\"Ruddier Than the Cherry\\" from Acis and Galatea. Even George Bernard Shaw, who had written disparagingly of the instrument (it had been \\"born obsolete\\") was impressed with this song when he heard it at Covent Garden. Hughes became professor of ophicleide at the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall and at the Guildhall School of Music. He died in poverty in 1898 in Reading, Berkshire, England. The ophicleide died with him. His widow received a small grant for his burial from the Royal Society of Musicians. His instrument is on display in the Cyfarthfa Castle Museum, known around the world as one of the best surviving examples of its type.

African- American commercial book publishers released a total of 154 titles in the period 1970‚Äì74, a dramatic rise from the previous high of 21 titles published during the five-year spans of 1935‚Äì39 and 1940‚Äì44. Institutional and religious publishers also increased their title output, rising from 51 titles in the years 1960‚Äì64 to 240 titles in 1970‚Äì74.Joyce, Donald Franklin. Gatekeepers of Black Culture: Black-Owned Book Publishing in The United States, 1817‚Äì1981. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983, p. 102. Concomitantly, there was a widening in the scope of publishing objectives on the part of African-American book publishers, who began to release titles that not only advanced their particular ideologies but dealt with topics unrelated to Black Americana or Africana. Such diversity is emblematic of the increasingly important role in American culture and society of African-American book publishers. General Many factors, including the rising literacy rate among African Americans and the greater numbers of African Americans enrolled in institutions of higher learning, created an increased demand for books and thus contributed to this surge in publishing activity. By 1969, only 3.6% of African Americans were reported illiterate, and by 1970, 357,000 African Americans were attending a college or university.Joyce (1983), p. 78. The 1960s and 1970s also saw increasing levels of professional employment and economic prosperity, and witnessed a growing consciousness of African-American history and culture. As well, a series of legislative acts at the federal level, including the Library Services Act (1956), the Library Services and Construction Act (1963), and the Elementary and Secondary School Act (1965), led to greater investment by the U.S. Government in education and libraries.Joyce (1983), p. 79. Occurring alongside these educational and economic gains were the political advances ushered in by the civil rights movement: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which officially prohibited much overt discrimination and abolished legal segregation in employment, schools, federally-assisted programs, and public accommodations; the 1965 Voting Rights Act; and the 1968 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed housing discrimination. Spurred on by the social and cultural advances of the late-1950s and 1960s, and an increased demand for books by and about African-Americans, the period 1960‚Äì80 saw the largest increase in new African-American book publishers in the 20th century.Joyce (1983), p. 101. The number of titles released by African-American book publishers rose dramatically, and these works addressed an increasingly diverse range of subjects. The significance of their role as intermediaries in the circulation of ideas within society was of primary importance to many African-American book publishers, and the intellectual and literary products which they fostered were integral to American culture. Taken together, these political, economic, and educational advances created opportunities for a growing number of African Americans to engage in book publishing, an enterprise of great cultural import. Books are a primary medium for the transmission of ideas, and thus book publishers can be seen as serving as crucial intermediaries between the authors whose works they publish and the society in which such works, and the ideas they contain, circulate. Commercial publishing Given that most African-American book publishers were small in size, and faced considerable difficulties in raising capital, acquiring the experience and expertise necessary to engage in publishing, and having their books reviewed by the relevant media outlets,Joyce (1983), p. 2. the cultural significance of their endeavors was decisive. Many African-American commercial book publishers \\"did not enter book publishing with the expectation of making a profit, but rather to publish books documenting and portraying the Black American and African experience and to open publishing opportunities for Black writers\\".Joyce (1983), p. 145. Broadside Press, founded by poet and librarian Dudley Randall in Detroit in 1965, is an excellent example of this tendency to focus on the cultural and social importance of book publishing. As Randall states, ‚ÄúMy strongest motivations have been to get good black poets published, to produce beautiful books, help create and define the soul of black folks, and to know the joy of discovering new poets\\".Boyd, Melba Joyce. Wrestling with the Muse: Dudley Randall and the Broadside Press. New York: Columbia University Press, 2003, p. 134. Specializing in the work of African-American poets, Broadside Press had \\"a profound influence on the development of American literature in the 1960s and 1970s\\".Joyce, Donald Franklin. Black Book Publishers in the United States: A Historical Dictionary of the Presses, 1817-1990. New York: Greenwood Press, 1991, p. 69. Its publications were characterized by an artistic sensibility.Boyd (2003), p. 238. and were circulated nationally and internationally. Poem, Counterpoem, by Randall and Margaret Danner, released in 1966, was the first title by Broadside Press, and between 1966 and 1976 approximately 40 titles were published.Joyce (1991), p. 64. Among these were works by a wide range of poets, including Nikki Giovanni, the Pulitzer Prize- winner Gwendolyn Brooks, Sonia Sanchez, Margaret Danner, Etheridge Knight, Don L. Lee (Haki Madhubuti), James Ryder Randall, and Addison Gayle. Despite the quality of the books and authors published, \\"persistent financial difficulties plagued Broadside Press and constituted real problems\\".Boyd (2003), p. 39. Troubles of this sort were common to many African-American book publishers operating in the commercial sector, and in certain instances led to their demise. Path Press, Inc. was formed in 1961 in Chicago by Frank London Brown, Herman C. Gilbert and Bennett Johnson,\\"Media Makers: Bennett Johnson\\", The HistoryMakers, August 19, 2013. but due to their inability to find a distributor the company did not release its first book until 1969.\\"Path Press Archives\\" at Chicago Public Library. Other publishers include Black Academy Press, Inc., founded by Sebastian Okechukwu Mezu in Buffalo, New York, in 1969.Black Academy Press, Inc. Official website. For Mezu, book publishing was not only a cultural endeavor but an assertion of his individual rights, as he made clear at an opening ceremony for the Press in 1970: \\"Here today in Buffalo ... is being constituted Black Academy Press, Inc. as the black intellectual seeks to reclaim his rights in a multiracial society and affirm his responsibility to his people in our complex pluriverse\\".Quoted in Joyce (1991), p. 51. Black Academy Press relocated in the 1990s to Baltimore, Maryland, and to date continues to publish numerous books, journals, and articles. The struggle to obtain the funding necessary to run a publishing house was not always insurmountable. The Third Press / Joseph Okpaku Publishing Company, Inc., founded by Nigerian-born Joseph Okpaku in New York in 1970,Holsendolph, Ernest, \\"Spotlight: Joseph Okpaku\\", The New York Times, July 20, 1975. was able to overcome its early financial difficulties and, by the mid-1970s, had become the most prolific African-American-owned commercial book publisher in the United States.Joyce (1991), p. 203. The goal of the Third Press, as Okpaku saw it, was \\"to broaden the scope and perspective of the reading public beyond the present narrow ethnocentric limits of the more conventional establishment publishers\\" (Chambers, 1971, 43). He also sought to internationalize the Third Press, engaging in co-publishing efforts with the Centre of Black and African Arts and Civilization in Lagos, Nigeria. Okpaku‚Äôs successes were apparently short-lived, as the Third Press, for reasons unknown, ceased publishing activities in 1986. Third World Press, founded in 1967 by Haki R. Madhubuti,Sackton, Laura, \\"5 Black-Owned Publishers You Need to Know About\\", BookRiot, and September 8, 2017.Black Classic Press, founded in 1978 by W. Paul Coates, are two of the oldest independently owned Black publishers still in operation. Non-commercial publishing For African- American book publishers operating outside the commercial sector‚Äîthat is, institutional and religious publishers‚Äîthe ability to rely on an existing organization for resources and funding was of crucial importance. Such backing did not remove the risk involved, however, as Charles F. Harris, the first executive director of Howard University Press, noted: \\"... it's always a bad time to start a university press. It‚Äôs a marginal business for people who like to take a lot of chances\\".Wagner, Susan. \\"Howard University Launches Its Own Press\\", Publishers Weekly, Vol. 205, No. 9, March 4, 1974, p. 49. Although books bearing its imprint had appeared as early as 1919, Howard University Press was not actually established as a separate administrative unit with a professional staff until 1972,Joyce (1991), p. 128. when it became the first African-American university press in the United States. Its initial list of books appeared in 1974, and contained 13 titles in history, biography, literature, and education).Joyce (1991), p. 129. The well-established publishing operations of civil rights organizations, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the National Urban League, continued to be productive in the years 1960-80; joining them in their efforts were newly formed African-American institutional book publishers, including the DuSable Museum of African American History, Inc. Founded in Chicago in 1961 by educator, poet, and artist Margaret Goss Burroughs, the DuSable Museum of African American History, Inc., was the first institution of its kind to be established in the United States.Joyce (1991), p. 96. Its book publishing activities began in 1963, and while of a relatively modest nature ‚Äî by 1977 fewer than 20 titles had been released ‚Äî its contributions have been valuable, with publications exploring \\"uncharted areas in black history and culture\\".Joyce (1991), p. 98. A number of African-American religious book publishers were active in the period 1960‚Äì80, notable among them the Sunday School Publishing Board of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. (SSPB), which was founded in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1916. In 1967, the SSPB established a general trade book unit, Townsend Press, to publish secular titles.Joyce (1991), p. 97. By 1990, the SSPB had become the largest African- American-owned religious publisher in the world.Joyce (1991), p. 199.

Martin Jr. (October 31, 1946 ‚Äì 2001) was an African-American sociologist and museum executive. He was the Professor of Social Work at Morgan State University. Prior to becoming the chairman Martin taught sociology at the university for more than 25 years. He was also the creator of the first wax museum dedicated to black history, Great Blacks In Wax in the inner city of Baltimore. Martin and his wife Joanne opened the museum on July 9, 1983, with only four wax figures: Frederick Douglass, Mary McLeod Bethune, Harriet Tubman, and Nat Turner. They had the heads of the figures made for them, and used old department store mannequins for the bodies. The couple was inspired to open the museum after they visited a wax museum while on vacation in Florida. Elmer Martin wanted to teach about black history in a way that would grab kids‚Äô attention. He and his wife wanted for their kids to have a sense of pride and history for their heritage. The wax figures in the museum include everything from former slaves to doctors, lawyers, and businessmen. The museum also includes a graphic scene of a man being lynched, a controversial scene to many. Elmer Martin, however, believed that it is necessary for the children to see what other historical figures had to overcome, to fully understand how great their accomplishments were. The Martins did, nevertheless, try to keep the number of athletes and entertainers on display to a minimum. They believe children know enough about those, and they need to know that there are black men and women who accomplished more. Over the years the couple received more than $300,000 in grants to renovate and update the museum, and it is still growing. Elmer Martin died of a heart attack in June 2001 while he and his wife were on a trip to Egypt doing research. His wife still runs the museum, and credits his vision for all of its success, and for teaching young African American children about their history.

His education was at a Quaker school in Tottenham. He was apprenticed at the age of 14 to the London engineering firm of Galloway & Sons. When this company failed, he joined the business of Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company in their factory at Patricroft, Manchester, on the banks of the Bridgewater Canal. In the 1840s he moved to Pilkington Brothers at St Helens and became manager of their glass-polishing department. While he was there he invented an apparatus for the grinding and smoothing of glass. In 1851 he left to join John Hutchinson, alkali manufacturer, in Widnes. In 1853 Deacon, with Edmond Leyland, filed his first patent, which was for an improved manufacturing process for sulphuric acid. Later that year Deacon left Hutchinson and went into partnership with the younger of the Pilkington brothers, William, to establish their own alkali works in Widnes on land between the Sankey Canal and St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway. This partnership was dissolved in 1855. In a new partnership with his previous employer, Holbrook Gaskell who provided the capital, the firm of Gaskell, Deacon and Co was founded. At that time all factories manufacturing alkali were doing so by the Leblanc process. In 1838 Harrison Grey Dyar and John Henmming patented an ammonia-soda process of making alkali. Deacon experimented with this process but had no success and Gaskell persuaded him to abandon this project. Between 1854 and 1876 Deacon, alone or in collaboration with others, filed at least 29 patents, all relating to alkali manufacture.Allen, J. Fenwick (1906) 'Chemical Classics; Some Founders of the Chemical industry ‚Äì Henry Deacon, Part 2', London and Manchester: Sherratt & Hughes . Retrieved 8 July 2007. Deacon also presented a number of papers to learned societies, including the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870, the Chemical Society in 1870 and the Warrington Literary and Philosophical Society in 1874. In 1867 Deacon took on a chemist, Ferdinand Hurter, on a month's probation.. In time Hurter was to become the chief chemist to the company. Deacon worked with him to discover an improved method of manufacturing chlorine from hydrochloric acid, a noxious by-product of the Leblanc process, and in 1870 discovered a better process, using copper chloride as a catalyst. Henry Deacon also played a part in public life in Widnes. He was chairman of the Local Board and played a significant part in establishing the waterworks at Pex Hill. He was chairman of the first school board in the town. Deacon married Emma Wade from Basford, Nottingham in 1851 with whom he had at least three sons and three daughters.1861 Census After Emma's death he married Caroline Rutt of Islington, Middlesex, in 1866. They had at least three sons and a daughter.1871 Census Deacon died in 1876 from typhoid fever at his home in Widnes. He was survived by his widow, seven sons and four daughters.

Publication history Kid Colt and his horse Steel first appeared in Kid Colt #1 (August 1948), from Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Originally his cover logo was subtitled \\"Hero of the West\\" but by issue three this was changed to \\"Outlaw\\". His origin was told in Kid Colt #11 (Sept. 1950), and is similar to that of the Rawhide Kid, another Western character from Marvel's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics. Pete Tumlinson was the primary artist on Kid Colt, Outlaw from issues #14-24 (May 1951 - Jan. 1953) for some of Kid Colt's earliest adventures; Tumlinson had previously drawn an anthological Western story, \\"The Magic of Manitou\\", for Kid Colt, Outlaw #13 (March 1951). Artist Jack Keller began his long association with Kid Colt in Kid Colt, Outlaw #25 (March 1953), and stayed with the character for at least a dozen years in that signature title. Comics writer and historian Tony Isabella wrote that Keller \\"drew more Kid Colt stories than any other artist and may hold the record for drawing the most stories of any Marvel character.\\" Marvel editor Stan Lee would later take over writing chores on the title. Cover artists included such notables as Joe Maneely, John Severin, and Russ Heath, until the frequent Marvel cover team of penciller Jack Kirby and inker Dick Ayers took over for the bulk of them from 1959-1965. A brief publishing hiatus occurred between issues #139 (April 1968) and #140 (Oct. 1969). Herb Trimpe did freelance inking for Marvel, and made his professional penciling debut with two Kid Colt Western stories, in Kid Colt, Outlaw #134‚Äì135 (May and July 1967). Kid Colt won the Alley Award for Best Western Title in 1966. Kid Colt additionally headlined the three-issue Giant-Size Kid Colt (January 1975 - July 1975) reprint series. His signature series ended with #229 (April 1979), making it the longest-running Western comic book.\\"Kid Colt, Outlaw in Don Markstein's Toonopedia, archived by Webcitation.org, Retrieved January 4, 2017 ReferencesExternal links  * Atlas Tales: Kid Colt, Outlaw Category:Atlas Comics titles Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:Western (genre) comics ","title":"Kid Colt, Outlaw"},{"id":"10896557","text":"MBRWizard is a Master Boot Record (MBR) management application for x86 and x86-64 based computers. As the use of disk imaging applications for backup and operating system deployment began to increase, as well as many users beginning to experiment with dual-booting Linux on existing Windows machines, key entries in the MBR were often changed or corrupted, rendering the machine unbootable. MBRWizard was designed to allow the user to reverse or repair these unwanted, destructive changes to the MBR, effectively enabling the computer to once again boot properly. Summary Originally developed in 1999 for internal use, it was continually updated and eventually released as freeware to the public in March 2003. Initial functionality was designed to sort partition table entries caused by effects of disk imaging, but quickly evolved to include the backup and recovery of the entire MBR, repair of a corrupt Windows MBR record, as well as direct modification of the disk signature. Additional functionality was added to allow partitions to be activated, hidden, and deleted. Later options were added to include disk wipe functionality, shutdown/reboot of the machine, mount/dismount of Windows volumes, and a staging byte utilized to maintain status between reboots. Designed as a cross-platform application from the beginning, MBRWizard is noted as being very flexible as it can be implemented natively on most PC operating systems. In addition to the freeware MBRWizard CLI version, MBRWizard Suite 3.0 was released in 2010 as a commercial product, featuring a new graphical interface, and the ability to create custom WinPE boot environments for offline repair and recovery.

The proprietors, Susan Schulze Hoff and Duane Hoff, are former executives of Best Buy Company. Since April 2008, Heidi Barrett has been the estate's winemaker. History Fantesca's property was originally the dowry of Caroline Bale, when she married Charles Krug in 1860. Even then, it was recognized as prime mountain vineyard land. A Cabernet Sauvignon from this vineyard made by Hannah Weinberger won one of the first awards for a wine from the Napa Valley in 1889. Susan Schulze Hoff is the daughter of Best Buy Chairman and Founder Richard Schulze. She began working in the family business at the age of 18 and, after 23 years, retired from the post of Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer in 2006. Duane Hoff began as a department manager at Best Buy and held the post of Business Development before his retirement. In February 2004, the Hoffs purchased the estate and cave, which had been developed by Robert Yeakey. At the time of purchase there was an inventory of 2002 vintage wine in barrel, which the Hoffs hastily finished and branded for a 2005 release. In 2018, Sommelier DLynn Proctor, who is known for an American documentary film SOMM: Into the Bottle was appointed as Director at Fantesca Estate.  Name Origins  The Fantesca name comes from the female character La Fantesca (who was part of an Italian comedy group, in theater performances of Commedia dell'arte). She was both the lover and equal companion of the character Harlequin and could always be counted on to charm her audiences.  Grape Varieties  From a property, the vineyard is cultivated with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc.  Featured Wines  Fantesca features not only the Estate Cabernet Sauvignon, but a Chardonnay and a red blend called All Great Things (made by Heidi Barrett). It also features a Pinot Noir, made by winemaker Tony Arcudi. Each vintage of the blend All Great Things has a different photograph with a different theme: *\\"Honor\\" for 2011 *\\"Duty\\" for 2012 *\\"Mercy\\" for 2013 *\\"Hope\\" for 2014  Mardi Gras  Susan and Duane Hoff have taken part in and been celebrating Mardi Gras since 2001, with the Krewe of Mid-City- originally at the encouragement of friends.

He is called \\"Fratre Francone Zutphanico\\" (\\"Brother Frank of Zutphen\\") in one document.The identification of the monk and the master has been disputed, but now seems widely accepted. For the contrary arguments see Ch√¢telet, pp. 22-25 He may have trained as an illuminator and painter in France or the Netherlands, and later worked in M√ºnster, before joining in St John's Priory in Hamburg by 1424 at the latest.Hutchison Works Two main altarpieces attributed to him survive, dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury and Saint Barbara, in an unusually intense style, showing awareness of French and Early Netherlandish court art. He probably arrived in Hamburg after the death in 1415 of the previous leading artist there, Master Bertram, and shows little or no influence from him, but he may have been influenced by the more courtly style of Conrad von Soest, about ten years older than Francke, who worked to the south in Westphalia.Emmerson The Hamburg association of traders to England commissioned an altarpiece from \\"Mester Francke[nn]\\" in 1424; the contract does not survive, but is mentioned in their memorial book.

His musical career began in the late 1970s. He is the vocalist of Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai, Tokusatsu, Underground Searchlie and Karate Bakabon. The lyrics of a Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai's song \\"Doko e demo Ikeru Kitte\\" affected the character design of Rei Ayanami, from the popular anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion.Neon Genesis Evangelion, volume two. He's also performed the theme songs to several anime, including Welcome to the N.H.K., Hellsing and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Biography In primary school, Ootsuki and classmate Y≈´ichir≈ç Uchida wanted to become manga artists, but they soon started to discover the big names of prog rock like King Crimson and Pink Floyd; Japanese new wave bands like YMO, Hikashu and P-Model; and the Japanese punk rock of Kenji Endo, Zunou Keisatsu, Jagatara, The Stalin and INU. Ootsuki was greatly influenced by all these bands, and started to become interested in music. Apart from music, the manga artists that most influenced him at the time were Yoshikazu Ebisu and Daijiro Morohoshi. In 1979, after joking around at Uchida's birthday party, they formed a band with a few friends (called \\"Dotechinzu\\", or \\"The Donzu\\"). At first none of the members could play any instruments apart from Uchida, who played the Electone keyboard. Ootsuki tapped the rhythm with a bamboo stick. The band broke up after the members graduated from middle school. In February 1982, him and Uchida formed the Japanese rock band Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai (back then called Kinniku Sh≈çnen Sh≈çjo Tai), with Ootsuki in charge of lyrics, vocals and bass. At the time Kera (Keralino Sandorovich), a senior student from Uchida's high school, had just heard the tapes they'd recorded as Dotechinzu and liked them, after which he joined Ootsuki and Uchida to form the side-project \\"Karate Bakabon\\". They released their self-titled release on Nagomu Records, the independent label run by Kera. After that, Kinniku Shoujo would also release a few albums on Nagomu. The first time they played live it became apparent that Ootsuki couldn't play bass and sing at the same time, so he entrusted the position to Uchida, who had played keyboards up until then. Then in the second half of the '80s they signed onto a major label. The way they described themselves in their promotional slogans was with the phrase \\"Rockers who get their leather pants from their parents\\". Ever since the beginning Ootsuki was the band's frontman, and in order to promote the band he began appearing on All Night Nippon as a radio personality. From there he started to appear in various forms of media, even in talk shows like Tetsuko no Heya. Ootsuki says he was extremely nervous on his first appearance on Tetsuko no Heya, and could hardly manage to answer the questions he was being asked. While the band switched labels several times, Ootsuki started his solo career with the project \\"UNDERGROUND SEARCHLIE\\", collaborated with bands like NINGEN-ISU, and continued with Kinniku Shoujo Tai until they disbanded in 1999. After disbanding, Ootsuki formed a new band called \\"Tokusatsu\\". Also, he formed the band \\"Densha\\" with musicians who had helped him on his solo efforts, like Ishizuka BERA Norihiro (from qyb, Kinniku Shoujo Tai and a support member for SOFT BALLET), Obata Pump (from Scanch, and Kenji Sato (from MARCHOSIAS VAMP). Apart from that, he continued to collaborate with various musicians under names like \\"Ooken & Nise Tokusatsu\\" (Ooken & the fake Tokusatsu), \\"Ootsuki Kenji & Yangusu\\" (Ootsuki Kenji & Youngs) or \\"Ootsuki Kenji & namae wa nandemo ii\\" (Ootsuki Kenji & whoever) to perform at all sorts of events. Even nowadays, he uses the side-project \\"Ootsuki Kenjis\\" (of which he is the only fixed member) to create music for anime and tokusatsu movies, for special events and shows or to play jazz and acoustic sets. Since 1998, he regularly hosts an event in the Shinjuku Loft Plus One called \\"Nohohon Gakkou\\" (\\"Nonchalant School\\"), to which he invites guests from the Japanese subculture to talk. Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai's had dissolved partly because of bad feelings amongst some of the members, but in July 2006 they held an event called \\"reconciliation\\" and reformed. In December of that same year they played their come-back live. Then on the 25th the \\"Ootsuki Kenji and Tokusatsu Fan Club\\" announced that Tokusatsu were disbanding. However, Ootsuki himself later stated on his blog that it was just needed some time to \\"recharge their batteries\\". Even so, during that time all of Ootsuki's solo projects and shows were played together with Tokusatsu members, like the Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei theme songs and live shows. In 2011, Tokusatsu reformed, released a new album and started playing live again. Since the first half of the '90s, apart from fronting Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai Ootsuki also began his literary career. He wrote various novels like \\"Shinkoushuukyou Omoide Kyou\\"(\\"Church of Memories, a new religion\\"), \\"Gumi Chokoreeto Pain\\" (\\"Gummy Chocolate Pineapple\\"), or \\"Stacy\\" (which was later adapted into a film), and also published essays like \\"Ooken no nohohon nikki\\" (\\"Ooken's nonchalant diary\\"). His literary style is greatly influenced by the \\"Sh≈çwa Keihaku Tai\\" genre (or \\"Frivolous Sh≈çwa Style\\"). He's also a member of the Japanese Sci-Fi writer's club, but according to Ootsuki himself he hardly ever turns up. Ever since Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai's come-back in 2007 he has stopped writing novels, but his serialized essays and talks are still active.

The station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100 kW from an antenna 371 meters (1217 feet) in height above average terrain (HAAT), giving it a wide coverage area, reaching Columbia, South Carolina to the northeast and nearly to Athens, Georgia to the west. WLUB's studios are located at the Augusta Corporate Center near the I-20/I-520 interchange in Augusta, and the transmitter tower is in Beech Island, South Carolina. WLUB operates a classic rock-formatted station on its HD Radio subchannel and on translator W292EE as Eagle 106.3. History WLUB signed on in July 1994. It began life as Eagle 102 - a classic hits station, broadcasting on the 102.3 frequency. That frequency had previously been WGUS - Big Gus (Country), Power 102 (contemporary hit radio), and Froggy 102 (Country) before settling on a classic rock format using the call letters WEKL. After years of dominating the rock market in Augusta with only a 6,000 watt signal, on August 13, 2007 WEKL traded frequencies with sister country station WIBL, becoming \\"Eagle 105.7\\" while WIBL moved to 102.3, becoming \\"102.3 The Bull\\". The 105.7 frequency began in 1952 as WAUG-FM, simulcasting AM 1050 WAUG (now WFAM). The station was sold in 1980 and became WYMX with an album rock format known as \\"Rock 106\\". This format lasted until 1984 when it became WFMG with an adult contemporary format known as \\"M105\\". WFMG then became \\"Sunny 105\\" in early 1986 under the WZNY call letters. In 1994, WZNY was acquired by Savannah Valley Broadcasting, which owned longtime contemporary hits outlet WBBQ. A format and airstaff swap was done in August of that year as WBBQ went AC and WZNY became CHR and within a year's time came to be known as Y-105. In September, 2004, WZNY was reborn as \\"105.7 The Bull\\", a gold-leaning country outlet with the new call letters of WIBL. On April 1, 2010, classic rock WEKL 102.3 flipped its format to Top 40, becoming \\"Y102.3\\", and soon after returned to the WZNY call sign, with the classic rock format and call sign moving from 102.3 to 105.7 as \\"105.7 The Eagle.\\" On November 8, 2013, WZNY began stunting with a simulcast of WEKL as it assumed WEKL's format as \\"Eagle 102.3\\". WEKL, in return, flipped back to Country as \\"G105.7, Georgia-Lina's NEW Country\\". On November 21, 2013, WEKL changed its call sign to WSCG to reflect the new format, and the WEKL call sign returned to WZNY, dropping the WZNY call sign from the Augusta area for a second time. The station brought back the syndicated Bobby Bones Show to mornings on January 2, 2014. It was originally heard for a brief period on Top 40 outlet Y102.3, ironically the station it replaced. On April 15, 2016, WSCG became 105.7 The Bull and changed its call sign to WLUB. On the same day, a companion classic country station was launched on WLUB-HD2 and on translator W292EE as 106.3 Bull Icons. On March 11, 2019, WLUB-HD2 and W292EE began simulcasting WEKL and rebranded as Eagle 106.3 which was in the process of being sold to Educational Media Foundation, becoming an affiliate of K-Love on May 31, 2019.

Du Brul. It involves Juan Cabrillo and his crew of concerned mercenaries, as they attempt to quell a revolution, support and spark another and save the East Coast of America from widespread infection and illness. Plot introduction The book begins with a brief chapter detailing the traversing of a section of the Kalahari Desert by a group of four Europeans, led by the experienced guide H. A. Ryder. The text tells of how they survive the desert thanks to Ryder's skills, but are being pursued by more than one hundred of the Herero King's best men, due to the Europeans stealing their hard-won diamonds. The chapter ends with the Europeans meeting with their escape ship, HMS Rove only to find it stranded on the coast. Simultaneously, the Herero attack the ship, killing the Europeans (presumably) while a massive sandstorm rages around them, reshaping the coastline and burying the Rove under hundreds of feet of sand, lost for eternity. The story continues with the Oregon (a high-tech modernized ship carrying heavy weaponry but usually masquerading as a dilapidated freighter) meeting with the leader of the Congolese Army of Revolution, Makombo. They 'agree' to trade 500 AK-47's, 200 RPGs, fifty RPG launchers and 50,000 rounds of Warsaw Pact 7.62mm ammunition in return for a quarter pound of rough (blood) diamonds. These weapons are then stolen by the rebels after double-crossing Cabrillo before the Oregon's crew had the chance to do the same to them. After narrowly escaping from those individuals, the Oregon begins to track the location of the weapons in the hope that they can seize them once again. In addition to this they also hear that a billionaire with a controversial product has been kidnapped. They take up the quest to free him. During this operation Juan is nearly stranded in the desert, but manages to travel by parasurfing his way back to civilization. After rescuing the billionaire, they find out that his former partner is planning to dump millions of litres of toxic crude oil into the ocean in order to enlighten the world about the environmental effects that our continued ignorance is causing. Luckily, the Oregon and crew do battle (oddly enough it's the Congo revolutionaries) with the bad guys and save the planet. Their curtain comes by giving the rightful owners billions of dollars worth of diamonds that will allow them to free Zimbabwe from the evil regime that is currently in place.

Of the eighteen children, six were convicted. Although there were allegations that this was part of a customary \\"Beat up a White Kid\\" day, both prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that the incident arose from a vendetta between two girls. 2003 case On May 1, 2003, school officials and students at Wilbur Wright Middle School separately notified police that \\"a large fight\\" was planned for after school near the intersection of Almira Avenue and West 110th street in Cleveland, Ohio.Miller, Steve. \\"Special day probed in girl's beating 18 preteens, teens charged in attack on white victim, 13\\", Washington Times, June 20, 2003.

Two police cars were there prior to the attack and when school let out they saw a large group of students walking in the street on West 110th. From their automobiles, the police warned them to walk on the sidewalk. Some of the students moved to block the police cars as part of the pre-planned attack.Hiaasen, Scott.

With the police kept at a distance, a pack of twelve girls and six boys, ages 9 through 15, began to run towards Melissa King, a 13-year-old white girl who was a student at Wilbur Wright and was walking home with two friends. On reaching King, one girl grabbed King's hair from behind and yanked her to the ground.Dissell, Rachel; Hagan, John F.

Defense lawyers and prosecutors both agreed that the attack sprang from a personal vendetta between Melissa and one girl. This girl testified that Melissa had overheard her talking to a school counselor after she was sexually abused and attempted suicide, and claimed Melissa had spread gossip about this. Within a few days of the attack, Wilbur Wright school responded by suspending five of the eighteen attackers from school for ten days. 2003 fall-out When the attack was publicized a day later in The Plain Dealer, more than 100 readers contacted the newspaper to confirm that the May Day ritual had been alive and well for years.Brett, Regina.

For example, one man recalled that when he served in the military, many of his friends reported, participated in, or became victims of this annual ritual. In June 2003, the juvenile justice unit of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office filed felonious assault and aggravated riot juvenile charges against the eighteen attackers. Stating that the attack was some sort of May Day ritual with the \\"focus to beat up a white kid,\\" the juvenile justice unit also charged the attackers with ethnic intimidation‚Äîa hate-crimes law. In July, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Joseph F. Russo entered not guilty pleas and appointed lawyers for the youth, and issued arrest warrants for the four who failed to attend the court hearing.The Plain Dealer (July 13, 2003) \\"May Day beating case in court.\\" Section: Metro; Page B3.

These six individuals admitted aggravated rioting, and two of those admitted to felonious assault. Judge Russo said that testimony from prosecution witnesses including Melissa was too conflicting, inconsistent and sometimes obviously false to prove the culpability of four defendants beyond reasonable doubt. He also concluded that \\"based on the evidence I've heard, May Day is reality and the evidence was overwhelming that this was an attack based on May Day and that the victim was chosen because she was white.\\" In drawing his conclusion, Judge Russo suggested that white students in Cleveland's integrated public schools have reason to fear assaults by minorities in so-called May Day attacks every May 1.Brett, Regina.

It was opened March 10, 1976, as a two-level mall located at the intersection of Fort Henry Drive and Memorial Blvd. It is owned by Hull Property Group. The mall has 3 anchor stores: Belk, JCPenney, and Dunham's Sports along with an anchor restaurant Piccadilly. Over 65 stores have been located in the mall. Many of the national mall chains have been operating here, as well as some local stores. There is no central food court in the mall, so the eating establishments are spread out throughout the mall. History Fort Henry Mall opened in 1976 as Kingsport's second enclosed shopping mall. Kingsport Mall located 2 miles away was home to department stores Montgomery Wards and Hill's along with several smaller stores, restaurants, and a movie theater. This mall was later closed and converted into the outdoor strip mall, East Stone Commons. Fort Henry Mall's original retail anchors included Sears, JC Penney, Miller's Department Store, and Belk. Failed renovation plans and loss of tenants Starting in 2010, the mall had planned a series of renovations on both the interior and exterior. The interior renovations were expected first, followed by the exterior. Also a name change took place (in mid-2008, for mall advertisements and doors). The renovations include: new stone-paved floors; gathering places with comfortable seating; a new children's play area; a fresh, contemporary design with brick and glass fa√ßades; a new clock tower; a food court; and monumental new entry structures. There were also two plans for expansion, one to JCPenney (which was to be demolished, with a new prototype building built separate from the mall. The anchor building would have been connected to the mall with a new promenade-style area with a courtyard and shops lined down a sidewalk. The plans later changed to expand the current building and renovate. The cinema side was to be expanded out to the end of Sears. That expansion would have included a two-story atrium with two escalators leading to the second floor. A food court would be on the right (currently Belk Home and Kids), and a dining terrace would be atop the expansion. The cinema would have expanded from an 11-screen to a 14-screen center. There would have also be 4‚Äì5 outparcels built in the parking lot, which were slated to be mostly restaurants. Interior work was to begin in 2010, which would have included the new children's play area. All work should have been completed by 2011 but continued to be pushed back. The mall received approval for city tax incentives targeting new tenants that may move into the mall. Signs went up all over the mall, telling everyone that big changes are on the way and also promoting the new name. The slogan used on the signs is, \\"You have to believe it to see it\\". Starting in late June, the mall started using its new name in the local newspapers and Funfest brochures. But the name change wasn't supposed to happen until after the building work was almost finished. If the expansion project had been completed it would have took the mall from its current size of to , which included the outparcels. The total cost for all of the renovations and construction has been projected between $30 and $40 million at the time of announcement. As of early 2010, the mall had yet to see much work. By this time, the original plans would have been well underway. But due to the mall management group, General Growth Properties, selling out their spot to The Hocker Group, the mall's plans were altered to expand and renovate. In November 2009, the mall received all new lighting in the hallways and courts throughout the mall. Then in late December 2009, Chick-fil-A, Radio Shack, and Waldenbooks all announced they would be closing for various reasons. Both Chick-fil-A and Radio Shack closed after Christmas and Walden Books closed in January. In July 2010, Dollar Tree also closed and moved to another location in Kingsport. The Belk Home and Kids store recently combined with the Belk Men and Women's store on the other side of the mall. The main Belk store was renovated, customer service was removed, and other space-saving measures took place to make room for the home and kids store to move in. The area that once housed the Belk Home and Kids store, Sugar Momma, and GNC were intended to become a food court with the planned renovations but the area only remained empty following these stores' relocations. In August 2011, Marquee Cinemas announced they would not be renewing the tenant lease and that they would depart the mall to build a separate complex in June 2012. This would leave the mall without a movie theatre. Little to no work has been done on the mall, and tenants continue to leave for other sites in Kingsport or just pull out of the market completely. By December 2011, the mall had gained The Children's Place as a major new store but also lost a cookie outlet and local shoe store. By 2012, the previously announced plans for renovation were scrapped except for the theater, which Frank Theatres took over operations of. They announced plans to build a 12 screen cineplex entertainment center including an IMAX theater, bowling alley, laser tag, bumper cars, and restaurant in the theater space and an addition to be built. Work was supposed to have begun in Summer 2012 be completed by Spring 2013, but failed to ever break ground.Theater Complex to be Built New ownership In 2016, Hull Property Group purchased the mall from Avision Young and soon after received a 20-year tax break from the City of Kingsport to begin renovations on the property.Kingsport BMA Approves Tax Break Incentive for Mall Renovation By this point, the mall had lost major retailers A√©ropostale, Kirkland's, Shoe Dept, Charley's Grilled Subs, Justice, Deb, Hallmark Cards, MasterCuts, and Christopher & Banks On January 4, 2017, Sears announced that they would be closing this location at the end of March.http://searsholdings.com/docs/010417_store_closing_list.pdf The name of the mall return to Fort Henry Mall in efforts to connect back with the community. Mall owners Hull Property Group entered into a lawsuit with Frank Theatres in December 2016 over unpaid rent stemming from contract issues regarding the original renovations of the theater following Marquee's exit. Frank failed to follow through with their plans to build an entertainment center on the property and but blamed the city for not following through with their end of an incentive deal. Frank in return stopped paying rent in March 2016 and was given an eviction notice in October of the same year.Mall's Operator Wants Frank Theatres Out a court settlement, Frank Theatres exited the mall in April 2017 leaving all equipment behind (as part of the court settlement). NCG Cinemas soon came in with a massive remodel of the theater and reopened in July 2017.NGC Cinemas to Open Mall renovations finally got underway at the mall in mid-2017. One of the renovations was the addition of Dunham's Sports in the former Belk Home Store.http://www.timesnews.net/Business/2017/05/08/New-Name-New-Look-and-New- Stores-coming-to-the-Kingsport-Town-Center On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney will be closing around October 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. After JCPenney closes, Belk and Dunham's Sports will be the only remaining anchor stores left.

It is a fictionalized account of Captain Sir John Franklin's lost expedition of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror to the Arctic, in 1845‚Äì1848, to locate the Northwest Passage. In the novel, while Franklin and his crew are plagued by starvation and illness, and forced to contend with mutiny and cannibalism, they are stalked across the bleak Arctic landscape by a monster. Most of the characters featured in The Terror are actual members of Franklin's crew, whose unexplained disappearance has warranted a great deal of speculation. The main characters in the novel include Sir John Franklin, commander of the expedition and captain of Erebus; Francis Crozier, captain of Terror; Dr. Harry D. S. Goodsir; and Commander James Fitzjames. The Terror was nominated for the British Fantasy Award in 2008 and adapted for the first season of an eponymous television series that aired on AMC TV in 2018. Plot summary The story begins in medias res in the winter of 1847, when HMS Terror and HMS Erebus have been trapped in ice, 28 miles north-northwest of King William Island, for more than a year. The weather has been much colder than normal, the ships' tinned provisions are dwindling and often putrid, and the sea ice and landmasses are mysteriously devoid of any wildlife that can be hunted. In addition to the natural dangers, the crews are being stalked and attacked by a monster resembling an immense polar bear. In a flashback to 1845, Sir John Franklin is assigned by the Admiralty to lead an expedition into the Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. Franklin's second in command, Captain Francis Crozier, joins the expedition as a means of distracting himself after being rejected as a suitor by Franklin's niece. Although the expedition begins auspiciously enough, three men die of disease during their first winter in the ice, and soon afterward, Franklin makes the fateful decision to travel around the northwest coast of King William Island, which results in Terror and Erebus becoming trapped. In the spring of 1847, Franklin sends out parties to search for open water. One of the parties encounters a pair of \\"Esquimaux\\" on the ice, a young woman and an old man. They accidentally shoot the man, whereupon they are set upon by the monster, which kills the expedition's fourth in command. When the party returns to the ships, the girl follows them. Crozier names her \\"Lady Silence\\", as her tongue appears to have been bitten off, rendering her mute. After the man dies aboard Erebus, the monster begins stalking the crews. Although the monster shows signs of intelligence, the men initially assume it is merely an unusually aggressive polar bear. Franklin is killed in a botched attempt to bait the creature, and a number of other crewmembers are killed as the months progress. Crozier assumes command of the expedition, with Commander James Fitzjames assuming the role of executive officer. Despite some initial tension between them, they gradually become friends as they attempt to deal with the conditions facing their men. An ill- fated New Year's Eve carnivale masque ends with a large number of the expedition, including three of the four surgeons, being killed by the monster and friendly fire from the expedition's Royal Marines detachment. Crozier subsequently orders Caulker‚Äôs Mate Cornelius Hickey (for wearing a white polar bear costume) and two other men (for unbecoming behavior) to be given fifty lashes. Hickey begins to plot against the officers. As the spring of 1848 approaches, Erebus is eventually crushed and sunk by the relentless ice. Its remaining crew decamps to Terror until Crozier finally orders the ship abandoned. The survivors relocate to ‚ÄòTerror Camp‚Äô, a tented refuge on King William Island. After ruling out an attempt to reach the far side of the Boothia Peninsula, Crozier and Fitzjames conclude that their best hope is to man-haul the lifeboats of both ships south to Back's River and then take the current to an outpost on Great Slave Lake, an arduous journey of several hundred miles. Before they can set out, Hickey murders Lieutenant John Irving and lays the blame on a band of Esquimaux whom Irving had in fact befriended; the Esquimaux are attacked and massacred in revenge. From this point on, the crews fear and avoid the native population. The trek across the island is brutal, and many men die from exhaustion, exposure, and disease including Fitzjames. The monster appears with deadly frequency, at one point slaughtering an entire boat crew as they explore an open lead in the ice. With no other options, the men continue to press south and eventually reach a position on the southern shore that they name ‚ÄòRescue Camp‚Äô. From there, the survivors splinter into several groups. Hickey and his faction declare their intent to return to Terror Camp, while another group opts to return to Terror herself. Crozier agrees to let them go, but later he and Surgeon Harry Goodsir are lured away from the camp and ambushed by Hickey's men. Crozier is shot and apparently killed by Hickey, while Goodsir is taken hostage. The remaining crew, led by First Mate Charles Des Voeux, reluctantly decides to keep marching south. All three groups eventually meet with disaster. Hickey's group, despite resorting to cannibalism, begin to either starve or freeze to death in a blizzard; the remainder are murdered by Hickey, who has begun to suffer delusions of godhood. Goodsir poisons himself, ensuring that any of Hickey's crew who eats his body will die. The monster delivers a death blow to Hickey, but pulls away and does not consume his soul. A later vision relayed to Crozier suggests that the monster will eventually become sick and die from consuming the souls of the explorers. The other groups' fates are not revealed, but it is implied that they all die as well, rendering Crozier the expedition's sole survivor. Crozier is rescued by Lady Silence, who treats his wounds with native medicine and brings him with her on her travels. As he recovers from his injuries, Crozier experiences a series of visions which finally reveal the true nature of the creature. It is called the Tuunbaq, a demon created millennia ago by the Esquimaux goddess Sedna to kill her fellow spirits, with whom she had become angry. After a war lasting 10,000 years, the other spirits defeated the Tuunbaq, and it turned back on Sedna, who banished it to the Arctic wastes. There, the Tuunbaq began preying on the Esquimaux until their most powerful shamans discovered a way to communicate with the demon. By sacrificing their tongues to the beast and promising to stay out of its domain, these shamans were able to stop the Tuunbaq's rampage. Lady Silence is revealed to be one of these shamans, and she and Crozier eventually become lovers. He chooses to abandon his old life and join her as a shaman. Characters ;Captain Francis Crozier :The expedition's second in command (he becomes commander of the expedition following the death of Sir John Franklin) and primary narrator of the novel. He is portrayed as a competent leader and skillful captain, though he suffers from alcoholism and a deep sense of insecurity stemming from his Irish ancestry and humble birth. He also is implied to possess latent psychic abilities. Towards the end of the novel he is shot several times during the betrayal and ambush by Cornelius Hickey, near Rescue Camp. Crozier is saved (in unexplained circumstances) by Lady Silence, who uses native medicine to heal his gunshot wounds. She teaches him how to survive in the adverse Arctic conditions and the ways of the sixam ieua spirit-governors, and the two become lovers. Crozier eventually joins Silence as a sixam ieua, and they have two children together. He adopts the Inuit name Taliriktug, meaning 'Strong Arm'. ;Commander James Fitzjames :The expedition's third in command and the de facto captain of Erebus prior to Franklin's death. He is an upper-class officer, described as handsome and charming. At the start of the novel, Crozier is wary of Fitzjames and jealous of the apparent favouritism that is shown towards him within the Royal Navy. However, they become firm friends as the novel progresses. Following Franklin's death, Fitzjames proves to be a very competent captain of Erebus and an invaluable assistant to Crozier. Throughout the novel, Fitzjames' physical condition steadily deteriorates, and he eventually dies of an illness (implied to be botulism) during the trek south across King William Island. ;Doctor Henry D.S. Goodsir :Trained as an anatomist and signed on by Franklin as an assistant surgeon, he is considered the lowest of the four doctors who set out on the expedition, since he is technically an anatomist and not a physician. Following the violent death of the other medical officers at the Venetian Carnivale, Goodsir becomes the only physician aboard either ship. Though he initially appears to be weak and effeminate, he is portrayed as a compassionate, strong-willed, and indefatigable man, who earns the respect of the entire crew. He is also one of the few men Crozier trusts implicitly. During Hickey's final and successful attempt to mutiny and leave the expedition, Goodsir exposes Hickey's real motives to take two sick and catatonic crew members with him. Despite Hickey's insisting the men are his friends, and he and his crew wish to care for them, Goodsir states the real reason Hickey wants the two crewmen is so Hickey's crew can eat them. Goodsir then proceeds to humiliate the flustered Hickey by instructing him in front of the entire expedition on how to butcher his able and healthy friend, Magnus Manson, should he need to later. Goodsir is later kidnapped by Hickey's mutineers, who repeatedly mutilate him when he refuses to assist them in butchering their dead crewmates for sustenance, and Goodsir eventually commits suicide by taking a lethal cocktail of drugs. He does this as a parting shot to Hickey and his men, as the poison he ingests will kill anyone who attempts to eat his corpse. ;Lieutenant John Irving :A young officer who is assigned the duty of protecting/investigating the mysterious Inuit girl, ‚ÄúLady Silence‚Äù, with whom he has become infatuated. Irving is portrayed as a roguish and carefree womanizer, who has signed onto the expedition for glory and fame. Despite this, he becomes a favourite of Captain Crozier's and is shown to be one of the most reliable officers on the expedition. Late in the novel, whilst on a solo exploration of King William Island, Irving befriends an Esquimaux hunting party. However, before he can return to camp and report his finding of the expedition's potential saviours, he is waylaid and brutally murdered by Cornelius Hickey. ;Caulker‚Äôs Mate Cornelius Hickey :Described as diminutive, devious, and a sea lawyer, Hickey is, after the Tuunbaq, the main antagonist in the novel. Hickey takes a strong dislike to Lt Irving when Irving accidentally discovers Hickey and Seaman Manson having sex in the bowels of HMS Terror and becomes enraged at all the officers when he is flogged in the aftermath of the Venetian Carnivale. His animosity towards Irving culminates with Hickey's horrific murder of the lieutenant on King William Island. Hickey's various attempts at fomenting mutiny are finally successful at Rescue Camp, when he convinces a number of the crewmen to attempt to return to the abandoned Terror Camp. After Crozier grudgingly allows Hickey and his followers to depart from the main expedition, Hickey attempts to return to Terror Camp, although he briefly returns to kill Crozier and kidnap Dr Goodsir. Hickey's crew is eventually killed by the Tuunbaq, which pulls away before consuming his soul, apparently owing to the corruption of Hickey‚Äôs soul. ;Seaman Magnus Manson :A giant, physically powerful man with mild developmental disabilities, Manson is Cornelius Hickey's lover and chief crony. Hickey uses Manson as a sort of living weapon, setting him on people who get in his way. Despite this, Manson is well-regarded by the crew, as his immense strength proves useful for many tasks aboard the ship. Captain Crozier shoots Manson in the stomach during the mutineers' attempt to kill the expedition's commander. Manson survives for several weeks, despite his injuries. Dr Goodsir lies to Manson and Hickey about the severity of the injuries, and ignoring his Hippocratic Oath, allows Manson to die without providing effective treatment. ;Ice Master Thomas Blanky :A forthright, jovial and likable man, Blanky is the only character who evades the Tuunbaq, which Blanky accomplishes not once, but twice. In spite of his escape, he loses a leg and suffers other injuries, including frostbite, after which he receives a peg-leg. Despite this, Blanky continues to maintain hope of survival and rescue, until he develops gangrene in the stump of his severed leg during the trek across King William Island. Realizing he is now nothing more than a burden to the crew, he opts to remain behind on the ice whilst the rest of the survivors struggle on, and he is eventually attacked and killed by the Tuunbaq, although it is implied that he dies fighting. ;Captain of the Foretop Harry Peglar :A respected member of the crew, Peglar is one of the senior petty officers aboard HMS Terror and is the ex-lover of Subordinate Officers' Steward John Bridgens. Peglar is dyslexic and has a heart complaint that becomes evident later in the novel. He is killed by the Tuunbaq, along with several other members of the crew, while attempting to explore a possible lead to open water. ;Subordinate Officers' Steward John Bridgens :The oldest surviving member of the expedition, Bridgens is the ex-lover of Harry Peglar's. A learned man, he becomes assistant to Dr Goodsir for a while at 'Rescue Camp'. With starvation and disease the only prospect, Bridgens decides to simply leave the camp and walk into the low hills of King William Island. He is last mentioned in the novel falling peacefully asleep after watching a beautiful Arctic sunset. ;Ship's Boy Robert Golding :23 years old at the close of the novel, Golding is no longer a boy, but he is described as possessing a boy's gullibility. Despite appearing to be loyal to Captain Crozier, he has secretly fallen in with Hickey's band. He conducts an elaborate, and rather humorous, subterfuge to lure Crozier and Dr Goodsir to the Hickey ambush site (his attempts to pronounce the word polynya: polyp and polyanna, exasperate Captain Crozier). Golding eventually dies along with the rest of Hickey's compatriots. ;Lady Silence (Silna) :A young Inuit woman who has a mysterious link to the Tuunbaq. After her companion is shot by a party from the expedition, she accompanies the expedition back to the ships. When her companion dies, she remains aboard Terror, settling into a chain locker in the ship's hold, and comes and goes as she pleases. The crews are afraid of her, believing her to be a witch, and on at least one occasion her life is threatened by Hickey's faction, though Captain Crozier is able to defuse the situation. She apparently follows the men when they leave the ships behind and saves Crozier's life after Hickey shoots him. She teaches Crozier how to survive in the Arctic, and they eventually become lovers. Silence's aptitude for survival is frequently compared to the expedition members' failure to keep warm and find sustenance in the harsh Arctic conditions. ;Sir John Franklin :Commander of the expedition and the nominal captain of HMS Erebus, he is portrayed in the novel as a pompous snob and buffoon, seeking one last chance at fame and glory after several failed Arctic expeditions and his dismissal from the governorship of Van Diemen's Land. Franklin is killed by the Tuunbaq early in the novel, whilst inspecting the site of an attempt to ambush and kill the monster. ;The Tuunbaq :An indestructible killing machine that has taken the form of a massive polar bear with an elongated neck. The product of a war between the Inuit gods, it has been banished to the frozen northern wastes. The Tuunbaq preys on all creatures within its icy domain but particularly likes to eat the souls of humans. Only the sixam ieua' - spirit governors of the sky - a select group of Inuit shaman specially bred for their psychic abilities, hold any sway over the beast. The sixam ieua allow the Tuunbaq to eat their tongues as a sign of their dedication, but they can summon the creature and pay homage to it with their throat singing and gifts of animal flesh. They communicate with it (and other sixam ieua) using a form of telepathy. Television series adaptation After the success of the show The Walking Dead, the US network AMC produced a horror TV series based on this novel. In March 2016, it was confirmed that AMC had ordered 10 episodes of the show, which premiered on March 26, 2018. David Kagjanich and Soo Hugh served as co-showrunners, with Kagjanich also penning the adaptation. Ridley Scott, Alexandra Milchan, Scott Lambert, David Zucker, and Guymon Casady served as executive producers. Publication information * 784 pages.

The service is syndicated by Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media. It was one of the original Transtar Radio Networks formats. Despite its old name of AM Only, \\"America's Best Music\\" is no longer exclusive to AM stations and is carried on some FM stations. Its main competitor is Music of Your Life, syndicated by Planet Halo, Inc. Until 2010, Timeless from Citadel/ABC Radio had been another similar format. The target audience of the format is listeners 35 to 64, with a range of softer hits, primarily from the 1950s through the 1980s, plus a few newer titles in the playlist. Artists include The Beatles, Celine Dion, Elvis Presley, Dionne Warwick, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, The Carpenters, Lionel Richie, Barry Manilow, James Taylor, Elton John, Anne Murray, Simon and Garfunkel, Andy Williams, Linda Ronstadt, Natalie Cole, Nat King Cole, The Captain & Tennille, and The 5th Dimension. The format also incorporates \\"new standards\\" material by artists like Norah Jones, Diana Krall, Michael Bubl√©, Rod Stewart, Bette Midler and Carly Simon. An occasional newer song is heard if it has adult appeal, such as some recent hits by Adele. Also, the network switches to all Christmas music beginning in mid-December through Christmas Day each year. History \\"AM Only\\" was created by Transtar Radio Networks at a time when FM had overtaken AM for listeners seeking music on the radio. Most AM stations that had previously programmed formats such as Top 40, adult contemporary and country music saw their listeners switch to FM stations. These stations were in search of a format for mature listeners who were content with hearing music on AM radio, especially if the station played songs that FM stations thought was too old or conservative. \\"AM Only\\" was promoted exclusively to AM stations, though it was not long before some FM stations used it as well. The format was promoted on-air as \\"Great Songs, Great Memories,\\" and it continues to use that slogan to this day. One affiliate used an ad which stated: > Ray Charles lives here. So does Rosemary Clooney, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, > The Lettermen, and The Nelson Riddle Orchestra. At WFEA we play the original > hits of the 40s, 50s and 60s. All day, every day. After a February 1987 debut with Chick Watkins as program director, \\"AM Only\\" had 157 network affiliates by the end of 1993. Growth of the format was helped by new material from Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis, and artists such as Harry Connick Jr., along with movies such as Sleepless in Seattle. KJUL jumped to number 3 in the Las Vegas market, and KOY became the number 5 station in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2000, over 240 radio stations used the adult standards format which was being distributed by this time by Westwood One.Doreen Oken, \\"K-JWL flaunts title as number one station nationwide,\\" Business Journal Serving Fresno & the Central San Joaquin Valley, 2000-05-08, p. 1. In the first decade of the 21st Century, the format added more uptempo material from the oldies and adult contemporary formats and promoted \\"A New Variety of America's Best Music\\". On October 1, 2008, America's Best Music absorbed Jones Standards, a short-lived format created by the now-dissolved Jones Radio Networks, as a result of Jones's purchase by Westwood One. Many, though not all, Jones Standards affiliates switched over to America's Best Music. Westwood One's subsequent purchase of Waitt Radio Networks added a second adult standards/MOR-based format to the syndicator's portfolio in the form of \\"The Lounge\\", formerly distributed by Waitt and now discontinued. In July 2015 it was announced that all the on-air personalities would be terminated as Westwood One downsized its air staff. Original morning show host Jeff Rollins and afternoon host and production director Carl Hampton were terminated as well as fellow weekday voice John Gleason, plus weekenders Pat McNulty, Wayne Yafee and Paul Worden. Rollins returned to the air, hosting mornings at WOSN, Ocean-FM, in Indian River Shores, Florida. Former DJs included Dick Heatherton, Nick Gerard, Ed Brand, Joe Daniels, Mark Haden, Rick Wagstaff, Rick Garza, Lou Simon, and Peter Doeblin. Chick Watkins, the format's former program director, was also a DJ for many years.

He played an important role in the Ottoman conquests of Egypt (1517) and Rhodes (1522) during which he commanded the Ottoman naval forces. He also helped establish the Ottoman Indian Ocean Fleet based in Suez, which was later commanded by his son, Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis. Kurtoƒülu was known as Curtogoli in Europe, particularly in Italy, France and Spain.Bono, Salvatore: Corsari nel Mediterraneo (Corsairs in the Mediterranean), Oscar Storia Mondadori. Perugia, 1993. He is also alternatively referred to as Cadegoli, Cadoli, Gadoli, Kurtog Ali, Kurdogli, Kurdogoli, Kurdoglou, Cartugli, Cartalli and Orthogut in several European resources. Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis was the father of Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis, the Admiral-in-Chief of the Ottoman Indian Ocean Fleet who commanded the Ottoman naval expedition to Sumatra in Indonesia (1568‚Äì1569) in order to protect it from Portuguese aggression. The Ottoman fleet arrived to the Aceh province in 1569, whose ruler, Sultan Alaaddin, had earlier declared allegiance to the Ottoman Empire in 1565. This event marked the easternmost Ottoman territorial expansion. Aceh effectively remained as an Ottoman protectorate until the late 18th century, and an ally of the Ottoman Empire until 1904, when it largely went under Dutch control. Background The name Kurtoƒülu means Son of Kurt (Wolf) in Turkish, a patronymic epithet derived from the name of Muslihiddin's father, Kurt Bey, a Turkish seaman from Anatolia who went to northwestern Africa for privateering together with the other Ottoman corsairs of that period such as the Barbarossa brothers, Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa. Hayreddin Barbarossa became a close friend of Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin, who named his son after him. Aruj, Hayreddin Barbarossa, Kemal Reis, Piri Reis and Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis operated together in the Mediterranean in many occasions. In 1522 Hayreddin Barbarossa sent his private fleet to assist the forces of Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis during the Ottoman conquest of Rhodes, which was the base of the Knights of St. John. Early career as a privateer In 1508 Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin obtained permission from the Hafsid Sultan Abu Mohammed Abdullah to use Bizerte as his base for operating in the western coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. The Sultan, in return, was to receive one fifth of his profits. Kurtoƒülu assembled a fleet of some thirty ships, carrying 6,000 corsairs, and in the summer of 1508 he attacked Liguria, where he landed his troops at Diano Marina and sacked the town. The following year he received an appeal from the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II to participate in the assault against Rhodes, and in February 1509 he took part in the Ottoman expedition to Rhodes against the Knights of St. John in command of 17 ships, transporting the Janissaries to the island. However, the siege did not succeed and was eventually lifted. In August 1509, near the mouth of the Tiber River in central Italy, he engaged two Papal galleys under the command of Baldassarre di Biassa and captured one of them. In September 1510, with a squadron of nine fustas, he landed at the island of Andros, which was then under Venetian control, and took dozens of captives who were later ransomed. Later in September, with a squadron of six fustas, he landed at the Genoese-controlled island of Chios and forced the governor to pay 100,000 aspri (silver coins) in return for the release of the island. Between 1510 and 1514 Kurtoƒülu operated in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the coasts of Spain, bringing the maritime traffic in the areas around Sicily, Sardinia, Calabria, and the Kingdom of Naples to a near halt. In the summer of 1514, with one galley and three fustas, he captured a Genoese flotilla near Corsica, including its captain, Matteo Trucco. In February 1515 Kurtoƒülu assaulted Rhodes and in July he landed at Chios, from where he set sail to raid the coasts of Sicily. Later that year he appeared off the coasts of Liguria where he captured a Genoese galley and towed it, along with its crew, to his base in Bizerte. In February 1516 he appeared off the island of Corfu where he received a message from the Ottoman sultan Selim I, who was in Edirne (Adrianople) at the moment, and invited Kurtoƒülu to serve in the Ottoman navy. Kurtoƒülu was to play a key role in the Ottoman conquests of Egypt in 1517 and Rhodes in 1522. In April 1516, with a force of 20 ships, he assaulted and sacked the coastal towns of Liguria, where he also captured a galley. In mid April, he captured a fleet of 18 Sicilian trade ships which were heading to Genoa, and sent them to his base in Bizerte. From there he went to Tuscany and blocked almost every single vessel near the port of Civitavecchia. The Papal States prepared a fleet under the command of Giovanni di Biassa and Paolo Vettori to engage him. Later in that month Kurtoƒülu assaulted the coasts of Catalonia in Spain. In May 1516, together with Hayreddin Barbarossa and Piri Reis, Kurtoƒülu once again landed in Liguria, and the Genoese allied themselves with the Papal forces under the command of Federigo Fregoso, archbishop of Salerno, in their fight against him. They were also joined by the forces under Pr√©gent de Bidoux, Bernardino d‚ÄôOrnesan and Servian, which together amounted to 6 galleys e 3 galleons. In the meantime, the combined fleet of Kurtoƒülu, Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis and Piri Reis, which amounted to a total of 27 ships (4 galleys and 24 fustas) assaulted the port of Civitavecchia, before sailing through the Channel of Piombino and landing at the islands of Giannutri and Elba, where they sieged the local fortress. In June 1516 Kurtoƒülu landed on the coast of Apulia and took nearly 800 prisoners. From there he sailed around Calabria to the Tyrrhenian Sea, where he captured a Sicilian ship which had recently arrived from England and emptied its cargo at the port of Genoa before returning to Sicily. He then sailed back to Djerba. Admiral of the Ottoman Navy While in Djerba, Kurtoƒülu received the ‚Äò‚ÄôKapucuba≈üƒ±‚Äô‚Äô of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I who asked him to become an admiral of the Ottoman navy and join the Ottoman expedition against the Mameluke Empire based in Egypt (1516‚Äì1518). Kurtoƒülu accepted the offer and immediately began preparations, but the Franco-Spanish attack on La Goulette and Bizerte in August 1516 delayed his participation. The Franco- Spanish forces were joined by the Papal fleet under the command of Federigo Fregoso, Archbishop of Salerno, which also carried a force of 1,000 soldiers. They were escorted by the force of Paolo Vettori who commanded five Papal ships (three galleys and two brigantines), the force of Giovanni and Antonio di Biassa who commanded four Papal galleys, the force of Andrea Doria who commanded eight Genoese galleys, and the combined forces of Pr√©gent de Bidoux, Bernardino d‚ÄôOrnesan and Servian, which amounted to six galleys and three galleons. The combined Spanish-French-Papal-Genoese fleet had searched for Kurtoƒülu in the vast area between Elba, Capraia, Corsica and Sardinia before arriving at the coasts of Tunisia. From there the combined fleet set sail towards Bizerte. The French and Genoese ships hid themselves behind the Isle of Galitta at night before attacking the port of Bizerte in the morning. Several of Kurtoƒülu's ships which were anchored at the harbour were destroyed, but during the fighting Kurtoƒülu managed to capture six French galleys, which he later used during the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517. The Genoese forces landed at the port but were repulsed by the Ottomans and Tunisians and were forced to retreat, during which they lost two galleys. Kurtoƒülu finally left Bizerte and set sail to join the Ottoman fleet which headed towards Egypt. On his way he landed at Albania, where he captured a Venetian ship near the entrance of the Adriatic Sea. In September 1516 he took part in the Ottoman naval campaign against the Mamelukes in Egypt. Later in September 1516, he arrived at Chios with four galliots and 18 fustas, where he filled his ships with water and other supplies, before sacking the ports of Crete (Candia) which was under Venetian control. At the vicinity of Cape Maleo in Rhodes he spotted 2 Venetian ships, one of which headed towards Kithira (Cerigo) where its crew managed to land but was forced to abandon the ship to the forces of Kurtoƒülu, while the other Venetian ship was captured in the sea, together with its crew and captain, Marino Falier, who had 2000 ducats of gold but was forced to pay 3000 more for obtaining his liberty. In the meantime Kurtoƒülu captured two more Venetian vessels ‚Äì one caravel and one galleon. He later sailed towards Fraschia, Rethymno and Chania in Crete, where he captured several other ships. After leaving Crete he assaulted four other Venetian- controlled islands in the Aegean Sea: Mykonos, Skyros, Serifos and Milos. From there he sailed towards Calabria with 15 ships and landed at Crotone, where he bombarded the city's fortress. He later sailed towards Apulia with two galleys, three galliots, six fustas and four other ships, and landed at Salento before sacking Supersano, where he also captured several prisoners but freed them in exchange of 1200 gold ducats. From there Kurtoƒülu set sail towards the Adriatic Sea, where two Venetian galleys started following him from visual distance to spy on his moves. At the vicinity of Cape Santa Maria in Lefkada (Leuca) other corsairs joined his fleet, which reached a new total of 22 ships. Towards the end of September 1516 he sailed towards Otranto and captured a Venetian ship from Zakynthos (Zante) before capturing 2 Papal fustas. The Venetians felt intimidated of his fleet and seemed powerless to stop his actions in the Adriatic Sea. In October 1516 Kurtoƒülu landed at Lavinio with a force of 18 fustas, where he hoped to capture Pope Leo X who was there at the moment for participating in a royal hunt; but the sentinels of the Papacy brought the news of Kurtoƒülu's incursion in time and the Pope was safely rushed back to Rome. Kurtoƒülu, in the meantime, sacked every single settlement between Lavinio and Anzio, before returning to his ships and setting sail towards the Island of Elba, which he captured and sacked. In November 1516 he landed at Sardinia before returning to Bizerte. Commander of the Ottoman naval expedition to Egypt (1517) In March 1517 Kurtoƒülu joined a vast Ottoman fleet heading towards Egypt with his own force of 30 ships near Bozcaada (Tenedos) and once again took part in the Ottoman campaign against the Mameluke Empire. Sultan Selim I assigned him the command of patrolling the Egyptian shores and preventing the escape of Tuman Bay (Tomanbay), the last Mameluke sultan, who finally surrendered on April 14, 1517. Establishment of the Ottoman Egyptian Fleet and Ottoman Indian Ocean Fleet  In June 1517 Kurtoƒülu entered the port of Alexandria with a huge Ottoman fleet of 170 ships, capturing 2 Genoese ships carrying 100,000 ducats worth of cargo on the way. Still in June, with several light vessels, he entered the River Nile and sailed southwards until reaching Cairo, before returning to Alexandria where he captured a ship from the Republic of Ragusa. In July 1517, together with the Ottoman Sultan Selim I who appointed Kurtoƒülu as the Commander of the Ottoman Egyptian Fleet and wanted to personally tour the newest Ottoman province which also provided the title of Caliph to the Ottoman dynasty, Kurtoƒülu sailed down the River Nile with a force of 25 vessels, which included large ships like galleys, galliots and fustas. Kurtoƒülu established the Ottoman Red Sea and Indian Ocean Fleet, based in Suez, which was to confront the Portuguese fleet based in Goa on several occasions throughout the 16th century. In this period Kurtoƒülu received a daily salary of 80 aspri (silver coins). Towards the end of the month he set sail with his fleet from Alexandria, which carried 500 additional Janissaries, and headed to the Dardanelles. In October 1517 he appeared in Rhodes and in December he sacked the Venetian-controlled island of Naxos, which was the center of the Duchy of Naxos. However, the Ottoman Empire was allied with the Republic of Venice at that time, and Piri Reis sent Selim I‚Äôs order to Kurtoƒülu for him to release the Venetian captives. In January 1518 Kurtoƒülu arrived at Constantinople (Istanbul) and was reassigned with the command of another large fleet, despite the protests of the Venetian baylo in the city. In March 1518 Kurtoƒülu captured a Venetian ship near Mytilene in Lesbos, and later that month once again assaulted Naxos. In October 1518 the Venetian baylo filed another complaint to the Sublime Porte, claiming that Kurtoƒülu captured 3000 Venetians and transported them to Anatolian ports. In December 1518 Kurtoƒülu joined forces with the fleet of Piri Reis and patrolled the waters between ƒ∞mroz (Imbros) and Chios. Commander of the Ottoman Navy during the Siege of Rhodes (1521‚Äì1522) In March 1519 Kurtoƒülu returned to Constantinople and in September 1519 Selim I assigned him with the command of the Ottoman fleet which was being prepared to capture Rhodes, the seat of the Knights of St. John. The conquest was eventually conducted by Selim I's son, Suleiman the Magnificent, following his father's death in 1520. In May 1521 Kurtoƒülu set sail from Constantinople with a large fleet of 30 galleys and 50 fustas, and headed towards Rhodes for his first attempt of conquering the island. Kurtoƒülu also wanted to take revenge from the Knights of St. John, who had killed two of his brothers and kept another one as a prisoner in the island. Arriving at Cape Maleo in Rhodes with his fleet, Kurtoƒülu landed his troops on the island and attempted to capture the Grand Master of the Knights, Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, who managed to escape. Kurtoƒülu later blocked the entrance of the Channel of Rhodes and sank several vessels at the port while capturing a Venetian ship from Crete. Realizing the impossibility of conquering the island with the number of soldiers in hand at that moment, Kurtoƒülu postponed the final siege to a further date, requesting further reinforcements. In the meantime, Kurtoƒülu joined the forces of Kara Mahmud and participated in the Ottoman naval expedition to Dobruja and the following land expedition to Wallachia, in July 1521. In early 1522 Kurtoƒülu returned to Rhodes and attempted to capture the ship of Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Grand Master of the Knights of St. John, while he and the Pregeant of Bidoux were returning from Marseille and entering the port of Rhodes. In May 1522, with 30 galleys, Kurtoƒülu appeared at Cape Sant‚ÄôAngelo, and between June and July he commanded the final and successful Ottoman Siege of Rhodes (1522), together with Kara Mahmud, under the supreme command of Mustafa Pahsa (and later of Suleiman the Magnificent, who personally took the overall command of the siege on 28 July 1522). Kurtoƒülu landed his troops at the island on June 26, 1522, and towards the end of July he appeared before the City of Rhodes. The Ottomans eventually captured the island by the end of December 1522. Sanjak Bey (Provincial Governor) of Rhodes Following the Ottoman conquest of Rhodes at the end of 1522, Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis was appointed Sanjak Bey (Provincial Governor) of Rhodes by Suleiman the Magnificent. In March 1524, Kurtoƒülu collected a large force of troops from Anatolia and ensembled his fleet in Rhodes before setting sail to Egypt, where he put down the mutiny of Janissaries in both Alexandria and later on the coasts of Lebanon together with Ayaz Pasha. He returned to Egypt in April 1524. Back in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas In August 1524 Kurtoƒülu arrived at Euboea with a force of one galley, two galliots, and fifteen fustas, and after some time there he set sail again towards Apulia, landing at Otranto and Gallipoli, where he captured a large ship along with seven other smaller vessels. From Gallipoli Kurtoƒülu sailed across the Gulf of Taranto and reached Sicily, where he landed his troops and assaulted several ports, before sailing North into the Tyrrhenian Sea and then south to the Barbary Coast of northwestern Africa. Return to the East Mediterranean In May 1525 Kurtoƒülu arrived at the coasts of Crete (Candia) where he captured four Venetian ships. In August 1525 he was back in Constantinople with his own galley, while he left his other ships at Tinos, where he had captured a total of 27 vessels (6 galleys, 2 large ships, 1 galleon and 18 fustas). In Constantinople he received 3 large ships and 10 galleys from Suleiman the Magnificent and set sail to combat the Knights of St. John, who now operated from their new base in Sicily and damaged Ottoman shipping (the Knights later moved to Malta in 1530, which became their final seat) together with the Maltese corsairs who joined them in such attacks. In April 1527 he was assigned with another mission to combat the Christian corsairs, which he conducted with 10 galleys. In July 1527 he arrived at Cape Maleo with a force of 4 galleys, 3 fustas and a brigantine, and captured 2 Venetian galleys while sinking the Venetian ship named Grimana. He sold the seized cargo at Methoni (Modon) before sailing to Rhodes with the captured ships. From there he sailed to Constantinople, arriving in November 1527. Final operations and death In April 1530 Kurtoƒülu left the Dardanelles with a force of 36 galleys and sailed to Rhodes. In June 1530 he appeared at the coasts of Sicily with 20 galleys and started chasing Formillon, a famous French corsair of that period, who damaged Ottoman shipping. He then returned to Istanbul, and left the city in March 1532, arriving at Rhodes in April 1532. In August 1532 he went to Zakynthos (Zante) where he had talks with Vincenzo Capello, Admiral-in-Chief of the Venetian Fleet, who later commanded the Venetian forces at the Battle of Preveza in 1538. From the Venetians he bought 400 gold ducats worth of silk and clothes, before setting sail towards Methoni (Modon), during which he captured two Venetian ships (a galley named Zena and another vessel) together with their cargo. The Venetian governor of Zante (Zakynthos), Matteo Barbarigo, asked Kurtoƒülu to give back the Zena, but Kurtoƒülu refused. The two sides encountered each other, and during the skirmish Kurtoƒülu damaged a Venetian galleon while bombarding the Venetian ports of Zante and Kefalonia. In February 1533 he returned to Rhodes. In May 1533, while Barbarossa was sending a ship that he captured from the Venetians from Alexandria to Constantinople, a squadron belonging to the Republic of Venice tracked down the ship and started bombarding it. Kurtoƒülu, hearing the sound of bombardments from a distance, arrived in time to save the ship and chase away the Venetian forces, while towing the ship to the port of Finike in Anatolia and rescuing its precious cargo. In June 1533 he appeared off Koroni (Coron) with 25 ships, before towing a Venetian ship captured by the Ottoman fleet to Rhodes. Still in June, sailing with a force of 4 galliots and 2 brigantines, he captured two Venetian galleys near Samos which carried armaments that were sent for defending the Venetian castle near Coron from Ottoman attacks. He then sailed to Coron and forced the Venetian commander Francesco Nicardo, who was appointed with the task of defending the area from the Ottomans, to sail away. In the meantime he liberated an Ottoman ship that was captured by the Knights of St. John and brought it to Rhodes, before returning to Coron and continuing his blockade of the area with a force of 40 ships, which prevented the arrival of the Venetian support fleet. In August 1533 he sailed back to Rhodes. In September 1533 he patrolled the area between Milos and Cape Maleo to search for Venetian ships and Christian corsairs who operated in the area. In October 1533 he patrolled the areas near Rhodes, where he stayed until his death in around 1535. Legacy Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis was from the generation of great Ottoman seamen in the 16th century like Barbarossa, Aruj, Kemal Reis, Piri Reis, Turgut Reis, Murat Reis, Piyale Pasha and many others. He played a key role in the conquests of Egypt (1517) and Rhodes (1522). Egypt de facto remained an Ottoman province until 1882, de jure until 1914. Rhodes remained as an Ottoman island until 1912. Kurtoƒülu established the Ottoman Egyptian Fleet based in Alexandria, and the Ottoman Indian Ocean Fleet based in Suez, with other later homeports in Aden and Basra. His son Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis became famous for commanding the Ottoman Indian Ocean Fleet against the Portuguese forces based in Goa and leading the Ottoman naval expedition to Sumatra in Indonesia (1568‚Äì1569). Aceh province in Sumatra declared allegiance to the Ottoman Empire in 1565, and effectively became a part of the Ottoman Empire with the arrival of the Ottoman fleet and stationing of the Ottoman troops in 1569. This event marked the easternmost Ottoman territorial expansion. See also *Ottoman Navy External links *Kurtoƒülu Muslihiddin Reis (Turkish)  References and sources  * E.

Classifying different microsites may depend on temperature, humidity, sunlight, nutrient availability, soil physical characteristics, vegetation cover, etc. Being a sub environment within an environment, we will examine the qualities that differentiate a microsite from another within an environment in this piece.  Microsite features  Microsites being a subset of the environment can be identified with its own:  Temperature  It refers to the temperature of the surrounding environment measured in degree Fahrenheit. The temperature of one microsite may not necessarily be the same with another one even if they are closely related in terms of location.  Humidity  It refers to the relative amount of moisture that could be held in the air. The more saturated the air is with water vapor in a microsite the more relative it is in humidity.  Sunlight  Plants uses energy from the sunlight to carry on photosynthesis. The possibility of sunlight to reach a microsite is another distinguishing characteristic which creates differences between microsites. There are some areas that the sunlight doesn‚Äôt reach which creates a different environmental condition than those that the sun reaches thus making some plants to have more fitness than others.  Availability of nutrients  Some microsites are rich in nutrients while some are not. This is a great difference because seeds germinate more in microsites that have more nutrients it needs than those that lack them. This is because plants and other autotrophs get nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and Sulphur) they need from soil and water available in their microsite.  Soil physical characteristics  Plants obtain hydrogen from water found in the soil. Animals are influence by the soil physical characteristics for example where a fish will survive is not the same like that of a camel or goat. All this features help differentiate one microsite from another and explains the existence of organisms in one and not in the other.  Vegetation cover  This refers to collections of plants species over a land surface. A microsite in the Savana is different from that in the Sahara because of their vegetation cover. This explains the differences existing between the type of organisms that live in both areas.  Microsite influence over habitat selection With the many microsites that exist in an environment, organisms usually base their selection of habit on the features of the microsite they come across. Being able to choose the best microsite will positively influence the organism's survival, growth and reproduction. There choice of a good microsite has a direct relation to the future generation of the organisms.  Limitation of microsites  Not all microsites have the necessary ingredients needed by plants and animals to survive and grow. While some may have, some condition may arise to render those ingredients not available again in the environment such as pollution or invasive species. In the case of seedling; air, light, soil, humus are all needed by seedling to grow and survive. The lack of these elements will cause a growth limitation factor in the said microsite and also survival issues. Same applies to animals but however in animals they can immigrate to other areas that favors their growth and survival while those who can not will be limited in fitness.

They were conducted at Bikini and Enewetak atolls by Joint Task Force 7 (JTF7).Blumenson, Martin and Hugh D. Hexamer (1956). A History of Operation Redwing: The Atomic Weapons Tests in the Pacific. Joint Task Force Seven Headquarters, Washington, D.C. p. 19. The entire operation followed Project 56 and preceded Project 57. The primary intention was to test new, second-generation thermonuclear weapons. Also tested were fission devices intended to be used as primaries for thermonuclear weapons, and small tactical weapons for air defense. Redwing demonstrated the first United States airdrop of a deliverable hydrogen bomb during test Cherokee. Because the yields for many tests at Operation Castle in 1954 were dramatically higher than predictions, Redwing was conducted using an \\"energy budget\\": There were limits to the total amount of energy released, and the amount of fission yield was also strictly controlled. Fission, primarily \\"fast\\" fission of the natural uranium tamper surrounding the fusion capsule, greatly increases the yield of thermonuclear devices, and constitutes the great majority of the fallout, as nuclear fusion is a relatively clean reaction. All shots were named after various Native American tribes. Redwing series tests { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + United States' Redwing series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Name The United States, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions - Soviet peaceful explosions were named).

He was publisher of the Afro-American newspaper chain of Baltimore, Maryland, expanding its coverage with regional editions in several major cities of the Washington, DC area, as well as Newark, New Jersey, a destination of thousands of rural blacks in the Great Migration to the North. Murphy completed a doctorate in 1913 at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) in Jena, Germany after earning bachelor's and master's degrees at Howard and Harvard universities, respectively. He became chairman of the German department at Howard University before the United States entered World War I. In 1918 he started working at the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, founded by his father. He led it for 45 years. Biography Carl Murphy was born in Baltimore, Maryland; his parents were John Henry Murphy Sr. and Martha (Howard) Murphy. He graduated from Howard University in 1911, earning a master's degree at Harvard University in 1913, and a doctorate at the University of Jena in Germany in 1913. Murphy served as a professor of German and chairman of the German department at Howard University between 1913 and 1918. That year he joined the staff of the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, run by his father John H. Murphy, Sr. since he founded it in 1892. In 1922, upon his father's death, Dr. Murphy assumed control of the paper. During the next four decades, he established the Afro as a major African-American newspaper of national importance. At its peak, the Afro-American published nine national editions, in a total of 13 major cities including Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; and Newark, New Jersey. Carl Murphy built up the Afro-American from a journal with 14,000 circulation to more than 200,000; and he employed more than 200 workers. In addition to managing the Afro, Carl Murphy became actively involved with the Baltimore branch of the NAACP. In December 1932, he declared the NAACP's intention to challenge racial segregation at the state's flagship University of Maryland. By 1935, with the help of NAACP attorneys Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP forced open the university's law school to black students. Their legal challenge was used at other universities across the Jim Crow South. Murphy supported the election in 1935 of Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson to the presidency of the local NAACP branch. She was straightforward and tireless, a counterpoint to Murphy's tendency to work behind the scenes. Jackson served in this post until 1970. With Murphy's leadership, the Afro was deeply involved in helping organize Martin Luther King Jr.'s August 1963 \\"March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\\". The paper designated a team of columnists and reporters to aid in the demonstration's promotion, and dispatched another team of journalist to detail its progress. In its 80th anniversary issue, the Afro called Murphy \\"a man with a purpose.\\" Murphy ran the paper for 45 years. He was a lifelong Mason. In addition, Murphy was prominent in the Republican Party: he was appointed as a member of President Herbert Hoover's 1930 Commission to Haiti. Later he was a member of the Electoral College for the 1960 Presidential election. His influence was felt far beyond his home in Baltimore, Maryland. As a result of Baltimore's segregated public education, Murphy and the Afro staff were very concerned about the unsatisfactory education being provided to black children and the complicity of Baltimore's white power structure. During the 1920s the newspaper intensified its campaign for a first-rate school system, in order to provide black children with upward mobility in American society as well as fulfilling and fairly paid employment for black educators. These efforts served as the foundation for a stable and prosperous black middle class. To peers and contemporaries, the diminutive Murphy was a giant in action. His grandson Ben Phillips described him as about 5'3\\" in height. Following the landmark U.S. Supreme Court Decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Thurgood Marshall publicly acknowledged a debt of gratitude to Murphy. Carl Murphy died on February 25, 1967, the day the Maryland General Assembly repealed a 306-year-old state law banning interracial marriage. The Afro publisher and civil rights leader had waged a battle for decades to have this law repealed. Murphy Family Carl Murphy met his future wife, Vashti Turley, while she was a student in his German class at Howard University. In 1911, while studying at Howard, Miss Turley and 21 other young women founded the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. Turley received her B.A. degree from Howard in 1913 and began to teach school in Washington, DC. Murphy and Turley married in the capital on June 20, 1916. Soon after that, they returned to Baltimore, where he started working with his father in 1918, essentially taking over management of the Afro-American. By the late 1930s, the Murphy family was prosperous and expanding. By then, the couple had five daughters‚ÄîElizabeth, Ida, Carlita, Vashti and Frances. Four of their five daughters held positions at the paper. Their youngest daughter, Frances L. Murphy, II, served as Publisher and Chairman of the Board in the 1970s. She succeeded John H. Murphy, III who was the son of Carl's brother, Daniel Murphy. Legacy *In 2015, Carl J.

When a game includes a health game mechanic and multiple classes, often one of the classes will be designed around the restoration of allies' health, known as healing, in order to delay or prevent their defeat. Such a class can be referred to as a healer. In addition to healing, healer classes are sometimes associated with buffs to assist allies in other ways, and nukes to contribute to the offense when healing is unnecessary.WoW: The official magazine Spring 2010 (Volume 1, Issue 2). Kill and Cure Pg141- Luis Villazon. A description of Healers from the NetHack Guidebook is as follows: When both healer and tank classes exist, a common grouping strategy is for the healer to focus healing on an allied tank, while the tank prevents other allies, including the healer, from losing health. Healers are often represented as a fantasy spell-caster (such as a cleric, druid or shaman), a realistic combat specialist (such as a medic or paladin), a science-fiction technician (such as a repairman or engineer), or the like. Abilities A healer is generally tasked with restoring health, removing poison-like effects, and reviving fallen party members. Different games may include different mechanics, such as the ability to deal damage or to enhance the attributes of their allies. Roles If the tank's job is to take damage, the healer's job is to heal it. In small groups, they may also be tasked to heal the group as well, but in large scale group-play there are typically specific healers assigned to party-wide damage (typically taken indirectly, via lesser minions, spells or environment/habitat of the boss). Specifications=Targeting specifics Healers fall into two major categories when it comes to targeting options: Single-Target and Multi-Target. Single-Target healers often have much more potent spells than their Multi- Targeting counterparts, such as those that fully restore a target's Health or resurrect an ally that had previously lost all their Health. Multi-Target healers tend to lack potency, but heal multiple allies (often the entire Party) with abilities. In Tactical RPGs or open-world games, their spells may utilize an AoE or Area of Effect mechanic. Healers that fall into this sub- type often do not possess resurrection spells. Healers often do not utilise only one targeting system. Targeting options tend to depend on the skill rather than the character. Sub-jobs Healers have a small number of roles that they can be delegated towards. Often, a healer will fill one or more of these roles. Alternatively, a healer may fill one of these roles in addition to some other job, such as damage dealing (Battle Cleric, Druid), inflicting negative statuses on enemies (Witch/Warlock), or even drawing in damage (Paladin). * Restoration: Restoring Health to allies. This tends to be the job most associated with healer classes. * Curation: Removing harmful or otherwise negative statuses from allies. * Support: Used in the context of healers, this typically refers to applying regenerative buffs to allies. * Resurrection: The rarest healer archetype, focused on not preventing death, but overcoming it. ** Necromancers are a blurry line against the grain of Resurrection healers. They're often more classified as a summoner, summoning skeleton or zombie themed minions to deal damage or draw enemy attacks.

Action Comics was started by publisher Jack Liebowitz.Rhoades, Shirrel A Complete History of American Comic Books (Peter Lang, 2008), , p. 16 \\"...Liebowitz coined the title Action Comics and asked editor Vin Sullivan to find material to fill it.\\" The first issue had a print run of 200,000 copies, which promptly sold out, although it took some time for National to realize that the \\"Superman\\" strip was responsible for sales of the series that would soon approach 1,000,000 a month. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were paid $10 per page, for a total of $130 for their work on this issue. Liebowitz would later say that selecting Superman to run in Action Comics #1 was \\"pure accident\\" based on deadline pressure and that he selected a \\"thrilling\\" cover, depicting Superman lifting a car over his head. Christopher Knowles, author of Our Gods Wear Spandex: The Secret History of Comic Book Heroes, compared the cover to Hercules Clubs the Hydra by Antonio del Pollaiolo. Superman In January 1933, Jerry Siegel wrote a short prose story titled \\"The Reign of the Superman\\", which was illustrated by his friend Joe Shuster and self-published in a science fiction magazine. It told the story of a bald villain with telepathic powers. Trying to create a character they could sell to newspaper syndicates, Siegel re-conceived the \\"superman\\" character as a powerful hero, sent to our world from a more advanced society. He and Shuster developed the idea into a comic strip, which they pitched unsuccessfully. National Publications was looking for a hit to accompany their success with Detective Comics, and did not have time to solicit new material. Jack Liebowitz, co-owner of National Publications, told editor Vin Sullivan to create their fourth comic book. Because of the tight deadline, Sullivan was forced to make it out of inventory and stockpile pages. He found a number of adventurer stories, but needed a lead feature. Sullivan asked former coworker Sheldon Mayer if he could help. Mayer found the rejected Superman comic strips, and Sullivan told Siegel and Shuster that if they could paste them into 13 comic book pages, he would buy them. The original panels were rewritten and redrawn to create the first page of Action Comics #1: # Baby Superman is sent to Earth by his scientist father in a \\"hastily-devised space ship\\" from \\"a distant planet\\" which \\"was destroyed by old age\\". # After the space ship lands on Earth, \\"a passing motorist, discovering the sleeping baby within, turned the child over to an orphanage\\". # The baby Superman lifts a large chair overhead with one hand, astounding the orphanage attendants with \\"his feats of strength\\". # When Superman (now named Clark Kent) reaches maturity, he discovers that he can leap 1/8 of a mile, hurdle 20-story buildings, \\"raise tremendous weights\\", outrun a train, and \\"that nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin\\". # Clark decides that \\"he must turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind, and so was created 'Superman', champion of the oppressed....\\" Two new panels offering a \\"scientific explanation of Clark Kent's amazing strength\\" were added. The panels do not identify Superman's home planet by name or explain how he was named Clark Kent. The next twelve pages showed Superman attempting to save an innocent woman about to be executed while delivering the real murderess, bound and gagged, and leaving her on the lawn of the state Governor's mansion after breaking through the door into his house with a signed confession; coming to the aid of a woman being beaten up by her husband, who faints when his knife shatters on Superman's skin; rescuing Lois Lane (who also debuts in this issue) from a gangster who abducted her after she rebuffed him at a nightclub, which leads to the cover scene with the car; and going to Washington, D.C., instead of South America, to \\"stir up news\\" as his editor wants to investigate a Senator who he suspects is corrupt, and prompting a confession by leaping around high buildings with the terrified man, which leads into the next issue. All the while, Clark tries to keep Superman out of the papers. Collectibility At the 2014 New York Comic Con, Vincent Zurzolo of Metropolis Collectibles displays the CGC 9.0 copy of Action Comics #1 for which his firm paid $3.2 million (USD). Comics Buyer's Guide estimated in 2012 that only 50 to 100 original copies of Action Comics #1 exist. Action Comics #1 has set several sales records for comic books. On February 22, 2010, a copy of Action Comics #1 CGC Grade 8.0 sold at auction for US$1 million, becoming the first million-dollar comic book. The sale, by an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer, was through the Manhattan-based auction company ComicConnect.com. On March 29, 2010, ComicConnect.com sold another copy for US$1.5 million, making it the most expensive and most valuable comic book of all time. The copy sold is the third highest-graded copy from the CGC, which stands at 8.5 VF+ grade. As of 2011, there were six known Comic Guaranty LLC (CGC)-graded copies with a grade above VG (CGC 4.0), with only one issue having the grade of VF/NM (CGC 9.0) at that time. EC and Mad publisher William Gaines, whose father was also a comic book publisher and had business dealings with DC Comics at the time Action Comics #1 was published, claimed in a Comics Journal interview that he at one point had dozens of copies of the issue around his house, but they were probably all thrown out. Another copy, rated CGC 5 (\\"Very Good/Fine\\"), was discovered in July 2010 by a family facing foreclosure on their home while packing their possessions. Estimated by ComicConnect.com to sell as high as $250,000, the comic fetched $436,000 at auction, saving the family's home. One copy was stolen from American actor Nicolas Cage, an avid comic book collector, in 2000. In March 2011, it was found in a storage locker in the San Fernando Valley and was verified by ComicConnect.com to be the copy sold to him previously. Cage had previously received an insurance payment for the item. A copy which sold for $2.16 million on November 30, 2011 through ComicConnect.com is believed to have been this same one, having been noted as stolen in 2000 and recovered in 2011. The Hollywood Reporter mentioned in its March 23, 2012 issue that a movie was in development based on the theft of Cage's copy of the comic book and would be titled Action No. 1. The screenplay was a spec script written by Reno 911! creators Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon and sold to Lionsgate. They will produce along with Peter Principato and Paul Young. A CGC 9.0-graded comic, with white pages, was auctioned for sale on eBay in August 2014. The seller Darren Adams, a comic book store owner in Federal Way, Washington, had purchased the issue from the estate of a man who had originally bought the issue from a newsstand on its release in 1938. The original buyer lived in high altitudes in West Virginia and stored the comic in a stack with others, which provided the optimal \\"cool, dry and dark\\" conditions that lent well to a comic's age, according to Adams. The comic changed hands twice prior to the auction; first sold as part of an estate sale when the original purchaser died forty years after its publication, and then to a third person who held the comic for about thirty years. Some years prior to the auction, Adams was contacted by this third person, and seeing the pristine condition of the comic, purchased it for a \\"seven figure sum\\". He held onto the comic for a few years before deciding to sell it, keeping the existence of it otherwise a secret, even rejecting a $3 million offer to buy the comic outright. On his decision to sell, he opted to use eBay instead of other comic auction houses like Heritage House, believing the auction site would reach a wider audience and was a better fit for the pop culture nature of the piece. After discussions with the site, Adams and eBay also arranged to donate 1% of the sale to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, reflecting on Christopher Reeve's role as Superman in motion pictures. The auction ended on August 24, 2014 and sold for over $3.2 million. This was the highest value ever paid for a single issue of a comic book. The purchasers were Vincent Zurzolo and Stephen Fishler, the owners of Metropolis Collectibles; Zurzolo expected the value of the near-mint comic to continue to increase in time. Reprints Beginning in the mid-1970s, DC reissued several of its most popular Golden Age comics as \\"Famous First Editions\\", including Action Comics #1, published in 1974. These reprints were oversized, roughly double the size of the original editions, and had a cardboard-like cover. The interior, however, was an exact reprint of the original comic, right down to the ads. As a result, the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide has, since the 1970s, published a warning advising that attempts have been made to pass off the reprint, stripped of its Famous First Edition cardboard cover, as an actual #1. However, the Guide does not cite any actual instances of this.Robert M. Overstreet, Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide #36 (et al), (New York: House of Collectables/Gemstone, 2006), p. 423 DC reprinted Action Comics #1 in 1988 as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of Superman that year. This edition reprinted only the Superman story, with a 50¬¢ U.S.A. cover price. The complete issue was reprinted in 1998 with an additional half-cover featuring the Superman stamp from the U.S. Postal Service's \\"Celebrate the Century\\" commemorative stamp series along with a \\"First Day of Issue\\" cancellation. It was sold by the U.S. Postal Service, shrinkwrapped, for $7.95. The complete issue, save for the inside front, inside back, and outside back cover, was reprinted in 2000 as part of DC Comics' Millennium Edition series of reprints of famous DC comics.Millennium Edition: Action Comics #1 (February 2000) at the Grand Comics Database The 1988, 1998 and 2000 reprints were published to the page-size standard of the 1988‚Äì2000 period, and not the larger page size utilized by Action Comics in 1938. The New 52 In early 2011, DC Comics announced plans to reboot and reset 52 of its ongoing titles, dubbed The New 52. This included ending the original 73-year run of Action Comics with issue #904, October 2011 (on sale August 24, 2011). The first issue of Action Comics volume 2, with a cover date of November 2011, went on sale September 7, 2011. The New 52 version of Action Comics #1 went through five printings. The fifth printing, which went on sale March 28, 2012, is cover-dated May 2012 in both the UPC box on the cover and the indicia, with no mention of its original November 2011 cover date. DC Rebirth In 2016, as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, DC restored Action Comics original numbering, releasing Action Comics vol. 1 #957 after Action Comics vol. 2 #52. Subsequently, a commemorative poster celebrating 1,000 issues of Action Comics was released in 2018, which retroactively listed all issues of the New 52 Action Comics vol. 2 with their cumulative issue numbers. As a result, Action Comics vol. 2 #1 is now also considered to be Action Comics vol. 1 #905 overall.

Such accusations can be brought by the alleged victim, or by another person on the alleged victim's behalf. Studies on the rate of recorded child abuse allegations in the 1990s suggested that the overall rate of false accusations at that time was approximately 10%. Of the allegations determined to be false, only a small portion originated with the child, the studies showed; most false allegations originated with an adult bringing the accusations on behalf of a child, and of those, a large majority occurred in the context of divorce and child-custody battles. Another possible motive is revenge by the person making the allegation against the accused person. There is also evidence that the UK (and formerly the New Zealand) systems of paying substantial compensation to alleged victims and their parents without requiring proof of the allegation, can provide a motive for making false allegations. A number of false allegations of childhood sexual abuse have arisen from the use of a scientifically discredited technique called facilitated communication. Types When there is insufficient supporting evidence to determine whether an accusation is true or false, it is described as \\"unsubstantiated\\" or \\"unfounded\\". Accusations that are determined to be false based on corroborating evidence can be divided into three categories: * An allegation that is completely false in that the events that were alleged did not occur; It could be done to get back at a teacher or employer who denied them a grade for coursework, a pay raise or promotion. It could also be done for the purposes of extortion or blackmail. * An allegation that describes events that did occur, but were perpetrated by an individual who is not accused, and in which the accused person is innocent. When a child makes this type of allegation it is termed \\"perpetrator substitution\\"; * An allegation that is partially true and partially false, in that it mixes descriptions of events that actually happened with other events that did not occur. A false allegation can occur as the result of intentional lying on the part of the accuser; or unintentionally, due to a confabulation, either arising spontaneously due to mental illness or resulting from deliberate or accidental suggestive questioning, coaching of the child, or faulty interviewing techniques. Researchers Poole and Lindsay suggested in 1997 applying separate labels to the two concepts, proposing the term \\"false allegations\\" be used specifically when the accuser is aware they are lying, and \\"false suspicions\\" for the wider range of false accusations in which suggestive questioning may have been involved. False accusations can be prompted, aggravated or perpetuated by law enforcement, child protection or prosecution officials who become convinced of the guilt of the accused. Disconfirming evidence can lead to cognitive dissonance on the part of these individuals, and lead them to deliberately or unconsciously attempt to resolve dissonance by ignoring, discounting or even destroying the evidence. Once any steps are taken to justify the decision that the accused is guilty, it becomes very difficult for the official to accept disconfirming evidence, and this can continue during appeals, retrials or any other effort to revisit a verdict.  Facilitated communication  Facilitated communication (FC) is a scientifically discredited technique that attempts to aid communication by people with autism or other communication disabilities who are non-verbal. The facilitator guides the disabled person's arm or hand and attempts to help them type on a keyboard or other device. Research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC, rather than the disabled person. However, the facilitator may believe they are not the source of the messages due to the ideomotor effect, which is the same effect that guides a Ouija board. There have been a number of accusations of sexual abuse made through facilitated communication, with many of the alleged victims being children. As of 1995, there were sixty known cases, with an unknown numbers of others settled without reaching public visibility. Prevalence Denial of child sexual abuse by the accused, or by others, is common and its reality is not easily accepted (though such a denial should never be interpreted as evidence of guilt). Reporting rates may also be substantially below actual rates of abuse as many victims do not disclose their abuse, which may result in an overrepresentation of false allegations due to the inaccurate estimation of actual cases of abuse. Of the millions of reports of child sexual abuse each year to state protective agencies in the US (including both substantiated and unsubstantiated reports), there is no formal determination as to what portion of those represent false allegations. Findings of multiple studies performed between 1987 and 1995 suggested that the rate of false allegations ranged from a low of 6% to a high of 35% of reported child sexual abuse cases. Experts have argued that the reason for the wide range of differences in the rates resulted from different criteria used in various studies. In particular, a lower rate was found in studies that considered false allegations to be based on intentional lying, whereas the higher rates were reported in studies that also added unintentional false allegations resulting from suggestive questioning. A 1992 meta-analysis suggests that false allegations represent between two and ten percent of all allegations. False reports are more common in custody disputes. Children appear to rarely make up false allegations of their own accord but will make false allegations if coercively questioned by individuals who believe abuse has occurred but refuse to accept children's statements that they were not abused (as was common practice during the satanic ritual abuse moral panic). False allegations can also arise as a consequence of false memories, sometimes implanted by questionable therapeutic practices. False retractions False retractions of accusations by children who have been abused are suggested to occur for one or more of several reasons: out of shame or embarrassment, fear of being sent to a foster home, due to the reaction of adults leading them to feel their behavior was \\"wrong\\" or \\"bad\\", a desire to protect the perpetrator who may be a close family member, fear of destroying the family, coaching by an adult family member insisting the child withdraws the accusation, and more.Schetky & Green, 1988, p. 66. False retractions are less common when the child receives timely and appropriate support following the statement of the allegation.  Effect of changes to legal tests (UK)  According to support group Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers (FACT), in 2000 there was a 90% conviction rate for alleged child sex abusers as compared to just 9% for cases of adult rape. In the UK, all the post-1970 court cases that are recognized as authorities on evidence of disposition \\"concern charges of sexual abuse of minors\\". In 1991, the House of Lords judgment in Director of Public Prosecutions versus P significantly lowered the barrier to admission of similar fact evidence of disposition to commit a crime. This, combined with the police practice of \\"trawling\\" for child abuse victims using door-to-door interviews and the potential for monetary compensation, has created opportunities and incentive for false allegations to occur: Normally, an allegation of a criminal offense has to stand or fall on its own merits: if a witness accusing someone of sexual abuse was sufficiently credible, or could adduce supporting evidence, then an abuser would be convicted. Until 1991, multiple allegations against the same person could only be held to be mutually corroborating if there were 'striking similarities' between the alleged crimes, indicating a criminal's 'signature,' a distinct modus operandi. But the judgment removed this protection. In effect, the courts have accepted the idea of 'corroboration by volume'. In 2002, the Home Affairs Select Committee (Fourth report, 2001/2), which dealt with police trawling practices and referred to the 'enormous difficulties' faced by those accused of child sexual abuse, recommended that the requirement for similar fact evidence to be linked by 'striking similarities' be restored in cases involving allegations of historical child abuse. However, this recommendation contradicted the Government White Paper Justice for All (2002), which proposed lowering the threshold for the admission of similar fact evidence still further. Effect on the child and the accused Allegations of sexual abuse can be inherently traumatic to the child when false. People falsely charged with sexual abuse often face numerous problems of their own. The nature of the crime leveled at them often evokes an overwhelming sense of betrayal. In highly publicized cases, the general public has a strong tendency to summarily assume the accused is guilty, leading to very serious social stigma. The accused, even if acquitted, risks being fired from their job, losing their friends and other relationships, having their property vandalized, and being harassed by those believing them to be guilty.  Support groups  In 2001 there were 18 support and lobby groups extant in the UK \\"set up to redress the injustice suffered by those who, they claim, have been wrongly convicted in abuse cases\\". Groups currently active in the UK include False Allegations Against Carers and Teachers (FACT), False Allegations Support Organization (FASO), People Against False Allegations of Abuse (PAFAA with SOFAP), and SAFARI.

He was Professor emeritus at Delft University of Technology in Delft, Netherlands.  Magic Formula tire models Magic Formula curve Pacejka developed a series of tire design models over the last 20 years. They were named the \\"Magic Formula\\" because there is no particular physical basis for the structure of the equations chosen, but they fit a wide variety of tire constructions and operating conditions. Each tire is characterized by 10‚Äì20 coefficients for each important force that it can produce at the contact patch, typically lateral and longitudinal force, and self-aligning torque, as a best fit between experimental data and the model. These coefficients are then used to generate equations showing how much force is generated for a given vertical load on the tire, camber angle and slip angle. The Pacejka tire models are widely used in professional vehicle dynamics simulations, and racing car games, as they are reasonably accurate, easy to program, and solve quickly. A problem with Pacejka's model is that when implemented into computer code, it doesn't work for low speeds (from around the pit-entry speed), because a velocity term in the denominator makes the formula diverge.Beckman, Brian (2007) Brian Beckman: The Physics in Games - Real-Time Simulation Explained, at channel9.msdn.com, Jun 08, 2007, min. 29:53-33:45 quotation: An alternative to Pacejka tire models are brush tire models, which can be analytically derived, although empirical curve fitting is still required for good correlation, and they tend to be less accurate than the MF models.Jacob Svendenius, Bj√∂rn Wittenmark (2003) Brush Tire Model with increased Flexibility, In European Control Conference, September 2003. Solving a model based on the Magic curve with high frequency can also be a problem, determined by how is the input of the Pacejka curve computed. The slipping velocity (difference between the velocity of the car and the velocity of the tire in the contact point) will change very quickly and the model becomes a stiff system (a system, whose eigenvalues differ a lot), which may require special solver. The general form of the Magic Formula, given by Pacejka, is: :y = D \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\left{ C \\\\cdot \\\\arctan \\\\left[ Bx - E \\\\cdot (Bx-\\\\arctan\\\\left(Bx)\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\right} \\\\, where B, C, D and E represent fitting constants and y is a force or moment resulting from a slip parameter x. The formula may be translated away from the origin of the x‚Äìy axes. The Magic Model became the basis for many variants.  Professional activities  Pacejka was a co-founder in 1972 and editor-in-chief of Vehicle System Dynamics‚ÄìInternational Journal of Vehicle Mechanics and Mobility until 1989. At the time of the founding of the journal, Pacejka had been an associate professor at Delft University, specializing in vehicle dynamics. His 1966 doctoral thesis addressed the \\"wheel shimmy problem\\". He published approximately 90 academic papers and was advisor to 15 PhD and 170 MSc graduate students.

T. Thurmond. 1969. New name for the mosasaur Compressidens Dollo, 1924. Journal of Paleontology 43(5):1298 Carinodens is widely considered a sister taxon to Globidens classified within the tribe Globidensini. Like its close relative, Carinodens also possesses distinctive round, blunt teeth for crushing primitive clams and oysters. Most of the cranial elements known from the genus have been recovered from deposits in the Netherlands, with the only known postcranial material being known from deposits of latest Maastrichtian age in Jordan.Kaddumi H. F. 2009. The first and most complete Carinodens (Squamata: Mosasauridae) skeleton yet with a description of a new species from the Harrana Fauna. In: Fossils of the Harrana Fauna and the Adjacent Areas. Publications of the Eternal River Museum of Natural History, Amman, pp 49-64 Fragmentary fossils belonging to an unknown species of Carinodens have been found in Crimea.  Description  Tooth of C. belgicus. Tooth of C. fraasi. Carinodens measured approximately 3.5 metres (11.5 ft) in length and is one of the smallest known mosasaurs. It was closely related to Globidens, though is scantly known in comparison. The holotype specimen consists of an incomplete right dentary and most subsequently referred fossils are isolated teeth. The holotype dentary only preserves the posteriormost teeth, meaning that until recently when more comprehensive material was recovered, most of the dentition of the genus (its most distinctive feature) was unknown. Carinodens can easily be distinguished from the closely related Globidens by the compressed nature of its teeth and its relatively delicate dentary. Russell (1967) offered a brief diagnosis (due to the fragmentary nature of the fossils) of the genus, then known as Compressidens: \\"Small projection of dentary anterior to first dentary tooth. Median dentary teeth bilaterally compressed, bicarinate, subrectangular in lateral view and with pointed apices. Anterior teeth circular in cross-section with strongly recurved pointed apices\\".  Dentition  By mosasaur standards, the teeth of Carinodens are unusually heterodont, both in morphology and size. The alveoli show a marked size decrease between teeth #8 and #7, and the teeth themselves change dramatically in both size and morphology between #8 and #7. This is similar to the maxillary teeth of Globidens dakotensis (between positions #5 and #6, though this is less pronounced than in Carinodens) and in Globidens alabamaensis.  Diet  Carinodens is like its close relative Globidens considered to have been a durophagous mosasaur. Because the anteriormost part of the dentary of Carinodens is relatively slender with small pointed tooth crowns, only the posteriormost five teeth actually functioned for crushing food. The anteriormost portion of the dentary was thus likely used for acquiring and handling food rather than crushing it, an idea already suggested by Dollo (1913) during the description of the type species. The maxilla of Carinodens is unknown, which hinders knowledge on the interaction between the lower and upper jaw. Dollo (1913, 1924) suggested a diet dominated by echinoderms, whereas Lingham-Soliar (1990, 1999) listed a wide array of potential prey items, including belemnites, nautilids, bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, brachiopods, echinoderms and arthropods. These groups were abundant in the late Cretaceous seas around Maastricht, meaning that their population numbers cannot explain the rarity of Carinodens. It is possible that Carinodens spent most of its life in deep waters, only rarely swimming in shallow seas.  Classification  Carinodens fraasi was first described and illustrated by Louis Dollo in 1913 as \\"Globidens fraasi\\". Dollo later erected a separate genus, \\"Compressidens\\" for the species in 1924, recognising the more compressed nature of the teeth in comparison to those of Globidens. Dollo also assigned Bottosaurus belgicus, previously misinterpreted as a species of crocodilian, to the genus as Compressidens belgicus. With the name Compressidens being preoccupied by a scaphopod mollusk, Thurmond (1969) proposed the substitute name Carinodens. Carinodens is most frequently recovered as a sister taxon to Globidens within the Globidensini tribe in the Mosasaurinae. The cladogram below, covering the Globidensini, is based upon a summary of evolutionary adaptations in the Globidensini featured in Schulp et al. (2004): It is worth noting that placing Prognathodon within the Globidensini is controversial, and it is most often seen as either a more basal mosasaurine or as part of its own tribe, the Prognathodontini. The primary feature distinguishing the two recognised species, C. fraasi and C. belgicus is found in their dentition. The teeth of C. fraasi are unicuspid and the teeth of C. belgicus are tricuspid. Carinodens fossils from Jordan, consisting of an almost complete skull with at least 24 teeth still occupying their natural locations, a complete neck vertebral series as well as several back vertebrae, and front paddles were reported by Kaddumi (2009). In addition to the dentary, maxillary, and premaxillary teeth, several small pterygoid teeth were also recovered from the same specimen. Kaddumi (2009) fully described the remains and referred them to a new species of Carinodens. Based on the remarkable dental heterodonty exhibited in the new species from Jordan, several previously not considered prey items may be postulated for Carinodens (Kaddumi 2009).

He and his team, in 2007, discovered a possibly terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the Gliese 581 planetary system, approximately 20 light years away in the constellation Libra. He also led the observational team that discovered HD 85512 b, another most promisingly habitable exoplanet.  Career  Udry earned a doctorate at the University of Geneva in 1992, and spent two years at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Later, Udry returned to Geneva, and worked with Michel Mayor, the discoverer of 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet found revolving around a normal star. In 2007, Udry was appointed full professor in the faculty of natural sciences at the University of Geneva.  Research  Udry's initial research concerned the dynamics of galaxies. His current work chiefly concerns the search for extra-solar planets by analyzing variations in the radial velocities of stars. Among them was Gliese 581c (announced April 25, 2007) which at the time, was the most likely candidate for habitability of any extrasolar planet discovered so far. The planet was discovered by analyzing data obtained by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6 meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. He was interviewed by Mat Kaplan on Planetary Radio. Udry described a new instrument known as the Echelle Spectrography for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations, dubbed ESPRESSO, might allow astronomers to detect Earth-like planets within five to ten years from 2010. An upgraded HARPS, of which Udry lead the observational team, found evidence that Gliese 581d might be more habitable (rather than c or g), and also detected another promising candidate: HD 85512 b.

It came into existence as part of a USAID-funded Presidential Initiative established at the 2001 Summit of the Americas, held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Caribbean CETT is a significant part of a hemispheric thrust by the USAID to improve student literacy in the first three grades of primary schools in the Western Hemisphere (Latin America & the Caribbean.) In the three regions of the Western hemisphere, the USAID created Centres of Excellence in Kingston, Jamaica, for the Caribbean, the CETT Andino, for South America in Lima, Peru, and the CETT for Central America & Dominican Republic located in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. In the Caribbean, the initiative is seen as a long-term effort through the use of education to improve the region‚Äôs economic prospects. Throughout the region persistent poverty and stagnant economies have combined to hinder full participation in the global marketplace. An educated population offers the answer to promoting social and economic development, jobs, and personal well-being. The ability to read and write well is the foundation for all future learning. An alarming number of children in the Caribbean lack the proper literacy skills needed for success in life. As they progress through the educational system, many of these children find it more difficult to grasp material, get frustrated and drop out of school. Their premature exit from the educational system limits future economic prospects and throughout the Caribbean has contributed to the cycle of poverty. It sponsored a study tour to Belize for teacher educators from Trinidad and Tobago in 2009. The Caribbean CETT has also made donations of library materials to the University of Guyana. Mandate The Caribbean CETT programme is implemented through the Joint Board of Teacher Education (JTBE) which is a part of the University of the West Indies (UWI) Mona, Jamaica. At its official launch on April 9, 2003, the Caribbean CETT was given the following mandates: *Provide innovative leadership in motivating, empowering and equipping teachers at grades 1-3 of primary schools to better teach reading and writing. *Train teachers at the primary level in the use of best practices in reading instructions *Design, develop, implement and evaluate creative methods of improving reading in project schools. *Develop relevant diagnostic tools to provide teachers with data for use in creating ‚Äòrelevant‚Äô programmes which will meet the needs of their students. *Produce and appropriate culturally sensitive teaching and learning material to project schools throughout the Caribbean. *Utilize improvements in information and communication technology to enhance and support all aspects of the programme. *Certify all graduates of the teacher education programme, so proving that they are competent teachers of reading and writing. *Ensure that synergy is maintained with the schools so that teachers of reading can keep pace with the latest developments and best practices of reading instructions.

The riveting machine offers greater consistency, productivity, and lower cost when compared to manual riveting.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 30, Cypress, CA, 2013. ISBN 978-0-9897906- 0-4.  Types  Automatic feed riveting machines include a hopper and feed track which automatically delivers and presents the rivet to the setting tools which overcomes the need for the operator to position the rivet. The downward force required to deform the rivet with an automatic riveting machine is created by a motor and flywheel combination, pneumatic cylinder, or hydraulic cylinder. Manual feed riveting machines usually have a mechanical lever to deliver the setting force from a foot pedal or hand lever. Riveting machines can be sub-divided into two broad groups -- impact riveting machines and orbital (or radial) riveting machines. Impact riveting Impact riveting machines set the rivet by driving the rivet downwards, through the materials to be joined and on into a forming tool (known as a rollset). This action causes the end of the rivet to roll over in the rollset which causes the end of the rivet to flare out and thus join the materials together. Impact riveting machines are very fast and a cycle time of 0.5 seconds is typical. Example of a 4-step orbital rivet Diagram of how an orbital riveting works Orbital riveting Orbital riveting machines have a spinning forming tool (known as a peen) which is gradually lowered into the rivet which spreads the material of the rivet into a desired shape depending upon the design of the tool. Orbital forming machines offer the user more control over the riveting cycle but the trade off is in cycle time which can be 2 or 3 seconds. There are different types of riveting machines. Each type of machine has unique features and benefits. The orbital riveting process is different from impact riveting and spiralform riveting. Orbital riveting requires less downward force than impact or spiral riveting. Also, orbital riveting tooling typically lasts longer. Orbital riveting machines are used in a wide range of applications including brake linings for commercial vehicles, aircraft, and locomotives, textile and leather goods, metal brackets, window and door furniture, latches and even mobile phones. Many materials can be riveted together using orbital riveting machines including delicate and brittle materials, and sensitive electrical or electronic components. The orbital riveting process uses a forming tool mounted at a 3 or 6¬∞ angle. The forming tool contacts the material and then presses it while rotating until the final form is achieved. The final form often has height and/or diameter specifications. Pneumatic orbital riveting machines typically provide downward force in the range. Hydraulic orbital riveting machines typically provide downward force in the range.  Radial (Spiralform) riveting  Radial riveting is subtly different from orbital forming. In most cases however, where high-quality joints are demanded, the radial riveting technology is the appropriate procedure due to the low cyle time, the little force needed and the high quality results obtained. The riveting peen describes a rose-petal path. The rivet is deformed in three directions. Radially outwards, radially inwards and overlying also tangentially. Excellent surface structure of the closing head: With the Radial riveting process, the tool itself does not rotate. The friction between tool and work-piece is thus at a minimum. The result is an excellent surface structure. Low workpiece loading: Even bakelite or ceramic parts can be riveted. Lateral forces are negligible. Clamping is usually unnecessary.  Rollerform riveting  Rollerforming is a subset of orbital forming. Rollerforming uses the same powerhead as orbital forming but instead of a peen has multiple wheels that circle the workpiece and combine two similar or non-similar materials together with a seamless and smooth gentle bonding via downward pressure as the rollers move downward or inward on the piece. Automatic drilling and riveting machine These machines take the automation one step farther by clamping the material and drilling or countersinking the hole in addition to riveting. They are commonly used in the aerospace industry because of the large number of holes and rivets required to assemble the aircraft skin.  Applications  Riveting machines are used in a wide range of applications including brake linings for commercial vehicles, aircraft, and locomotives, textile and leather goods, metal brackets, window and door furniture, latches and even mobile phones. Many materials can be riveted together using riveting machines including delicate and brittle materials, and sensitive electrical or electronic components.

His highest rank was komusubi. He won a top division tournament championship in March 1968. He was also a sumo coach. Career He joined the Tatsunami stable in March 1957 and reached the top makuuchi division in May 1963. He was small, at just 178 cm and 103 kg, but he was very popular with sumo fans. In July 1964 he reached his highest rank of komusubi, which he was to hold on three occasions with a combined record of only 10 wins against 35 losses. He was runner-up to Kashiwado in the July 1967 tournament. In March 1968, ranked as a maegashira, he won the championship (y≈´sh≈ç) in the top division with a 13‚Äì2 record, finishing ahead of ≈çzeki Yutakayama and Tamanoshima. Yokozuna Taih≈ç was out through injury and Sadanoyama announced his retirement, and Wakanami did not have to face anyone ranked higher than sekiwake during the tournament. It was not a popular victory, as the public had wanted the well-liked Yutakayama to finally win his first y≈´sh≈ç (which he never managed to achieve), and it led to demands that low ranking maegashira challenging for the y≈´sh≈ç be matched against all the other contenders in the crucial final days of the tournament, now a standard practice. He was promoted to komusubi for the following tournament but could manage only two wins there. He fought in the makuuchi division for 52 tournaments in total. He won four special prizes, two for Fighting Spirit and two for Technique. He earned three kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He fell briefly to the j≈´ry≈ç division in 1969 and won the second division championship, becoming the first wrestler to do this after winning the top division championship. He retired in March 1972. Fighting style Although small by sumo standards, Wakanami was very strong in his arms and back, and liked to try tsuri (lifts) even on very heavy opponents like Takamiyama. He was also known for his agility, and his ability to spin on the edge of the dohy≈ç. During his tournament victory he won five of his matches by utchari (ring edge throw). One of his chief rivals was sekiwake My≈çbudani with whom he had several spirited matches. Retirement from sumo He stayed in the sumo world after retirement as a coach at his stable, and was known as Onaruto and then Tamagaki Oyakata. Wakanami left the Sumo Association upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 in March 2006, although he had been hospitalized since December 2004 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. His nephew was also a sumo wrestler in the Tatsunami stable, and reached a highest rank of makushita 2 before retiring in March 2010. He was known as Wakainami for most of his career, but was told he could drop the \\"i\\" and use his uncle's shikona if he reached the j≈´ry≈ç division. He never did, but after visiting his uncle in hospital in September 2005, was given permission to use the Wakanami shikona before his uncle retired. Wakanami died in a Tokyo hospital following complications from pneumonia on 17 April 2007. Career record *The Nagoya tournament was first held in 1958.

It was formed in the 1950s, along with other AEFs, to teach basic flying to members of the Air Training Corps (ATC), Combined Cadet Force (CCF) (Royal Air Force) Section. It mainly flies cadets from the local wings of Cumbria and North Lancashire WingCumbria and North Lancashire (the North Lancashire half only as the Cumbrian half use 11 AEF at RAF Leeming, due to the distance from RAF Woodvale), Greater Manchester Wing, Merseyside Wing, No. 2 Welsh Wing, the East Lancashire Wing, CCF contingents and Air Scouts. It will also fly cadets on annual camp at RAF Valley, when it will sometimes send an aircraft to RAF Mona for a day to fly the cadets on camp there. This increases the chance of flying for all cadets and cuts the road journey from RAF Valley to RAF Woodvale. Air cadets and CCF sections from Northern Ireland also fly at Woodvale.  History  No.10 AEF Chipmunk T.10 aircraft at RAF Woodvale in 1983 10 AEF was raised on 8 September 1958 at RAF Woodvale, which is located near Southport. It is one of the few AEFs that has not been moved to another location or temporarily disbanded and later reformed. In 1996 10 AEF was placed under the command of Manchester and Salford Universities Air Squadron (UAS), one of the two UAS' to operate out of Woodvale, the other being Liverpool University Air Squadron. 10 AEF fly the Grob Tutor aircraft, which it gained in 2001; prior to that it was equipped with the Scottish Aviation Bulldog from 1996 and the de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk from 1958 - 1996. In both cases where the Air Experience Flights have updated their aircraft, 10 AEF has been the last to receive their new mounts. 10 AEF, like all AEFs, no longer own their own aircraft but use other machines from the two UAS' at RAF Woodvale. From April 2017 to May 2019 flying was suspended due to infrastructure issues. The main runway was rebuilt in early 2019 and flying resumed in May. Permanent staff  A 10 AEF Grob Tutor with hangar in the background at RAF Woodvale. 10 AEF has a team of professional pilots both military and civilian, who fly the cadets. Pilots apply to join an AEF through Headquarters Air Cadets and undergo security and Criminal Records Bureau checks (which all ACO adult staff have every five years). A pilot may continue with an AEF until he or she is aged 65. On appointment pilots will be commissioned (if not regular pilots) as Flying Officers in the RAF Reserve, resulting in retired senior and air officers holding the rank of Flying Officer for work with AEFs and a much higher rank for other duties. 10 AEF also has several Flight Lieutenants, one of whom is appointed the Officer Commanding (OC). Past AEF flight commanders have held the rank of Squadron Leader. 10 AEF is unique in being the first to have a Squadron Adjutant in post. 10 AEF is assisted by a team of Survival Equipment Fitters (occasionally referred to as Squippers), from Babcock International; all have previous regular military service. Their responsibilities are to service the aircraft, issue the cadets their flying equipment and to check the cadets are secured into the aircraft. Occasionally 10 AEF receives holding officers from the RAF waiting for their trade course to start. For their tenure at the AEF they are generally placed on the Flight Staff Team, or if an officer is undergoing pilot training and has already completed some of their pilot training, they will sometimes fly cadets.  Flight staff  In addition to pilots and Survival Equipment Fitters, there are also a team of Flight Staff Cadets (FSCs) and Adult Flight Staff, who are commanded by the Officer in Charge Flight Staff (OICFS), a RAFAC officer/SNCO who answers to the OC. The OICFS organises the daily rota for the duty flight staff, he is also responsible for the selecting of new flight staff and making sure former members return their kit. Potential flight staff usually have to be of at least Cadet Corporal rank and Master Cadet Classification (for ATC cadets) and Cadet Junior Corporal and Proficiency 3 Classification (For CCF RAF Cadets), some exceptions to this rule have been made in the past, but are rare. They are normally drawn from the local ATC squadrons or CCF units within a reasonable traveling distance. Applications are to be made in writing and potential Flight Staff are interviewed by the OC Flight Staff or sometimes the OC; if appointed they will serve a probationary period of about three months. After a probationary period flight staff are issued a set of flying kit, comprising flight jacket/cold weather jacket (olive green), white knee-boards and clear plastic covers (for recording details in the aircraft or on the taxiway), flying gloves (white), flying suit, aircrew socks and aircrew roll neck top and no1 RAF airmans/ airwomens cap. Boots (not necessarily the flying type, but these are preferred) and unit/name badges are worn by both Pilots and Flight Staff. The 10 AEF unit badge is worn on the upper right arm and the name tape is worn on the left hand side of the chest. Members of the Flight Staff Team attend the days when 10 AEF are flying cadets; it will usually be at the weekend, where a group of 50 cadets from an ATC Wing will fly per day. Non-AC flights are usually smaller and generally serve CCF units or ATC Sqnadrons organised special slots. These run from Tuesday to Friday and are less likely to be assisted by flight staff who are usually either in education or work. Their responsibilities are to conduct the briefing before any cadets fly, assist with the running of the flight, maintain the flying log, make sure the cadets get to the aircraft safely and look after the safety and maintain the discipline of visiting cadets and staff whilst on the ground.

By creating a precedent for cross-sector partnering and integrated planning to achieve this ambitious goal, GHP is laying the groundwork for nationwide transferability. History In 2002, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) named environmental stewardship and streamlining one of three ‚Äúvital few‚Äù goals (along with safety and congestion mitigation). After this, substantial FHWA investments resulted in a wave of environmentally-focused programs such as Context Sensitive Solutions, the Exemplary Ecosystem Initiative, and others. The FHWA consulted the United States Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Mid-Atlantic Region 3 and determined that the effort would require consolidation of the various programs and an interconnected, multidisciplinary organization. They determined that market- based incentives would be the most effective means to achieve their goals. After an executive planning charrette and culminating forum, followed by a retreat, the Green Highways Partnership began. Strategy With an extensive network of environmental, industrial and governmental collaborators, GHP advocates active cooperation and regulatory progressiveness to move beyond the current paradigm. The combined resources of its partner base allow Green Highways to ensure that sustainability becomes the driving force behind infrastructure development. Because of GHP's large and diverse partner base, various perspectives can contribute to the green highway lifecycle process. Green highways require integrated planning that takes into account perspectives of all stakeholders. GHP often utilizes a charrette process to expedite the design process.Green Highways Partnership - Sustainable Transportation, Stormwater, Stewardship, Ecosystems, Recycling ReferencesSee also *Green building *Green highway construction External links *Green Highways Partnership Website *U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 3 *Federal Highway Administration *Low Impact Development Center Category:Sustainability organizations ","title":"Green Highways Partnership"},{"id":"10897635","title":"Rocky Saganiuk"},{"id":"10897655","text":"Giovanni Fusco (10 October 1906, Sant'Agata dei Goti, Benevento ‚Äì 31 May 1968, Rome) was an Italian composer, pianist and conductor, who has written numerous film scores since 1936, including those of Alain Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and La guerre est finie (1966), as well as of most of the 1948-1964 films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, from N.U.

It occurs in the sand dunes of Florida and Alabama beaches. It has been classified by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species due to the specificity of its habitat and the natural and human-induced destruction thereof. Description The Anastasia Island beach mouse has an average body length of including tail. The coat tends to be a pale tan color with a white underbelly. Subtle white markings can be found across the face and muzzle. Their coloration, being substantially lighter than inland members of their species, is thought to be an adaptation to help them blend into their sandy habitats and avoid predators. Males and non-reproducing females average a weight of and pregnant females have an average weight of . Habitat The mouse occurs in the sandy dunes of Anastasia Island in Florida. Though the species once ranged from St. Johns River in northern Florida to Anastasia Island in St. Augustine, Florida, habitat destruction limited and eventually eliminated populations in the northern part of the state. The mature, sparsely vegetated, scrubby dunes offer the best burrowing environment, as well as providing the mice with ample food sources. These dunes tend to occur between the high-tide line and the more densely vegetated dunes farther inland. Though sometimes found in the inland dunes, very little foraging takes place there. The mice use the heavy coastal grass cover there to provide protection and avoid detection from predators. Occasionally, beach mice make their homes in abandoned burrows of ghost crabs, but are also capable of creating their own. Behavior=Diet The mice eat small insects and coastal plant such as beach grasses and sea oats. They gather seeds which have separated from the plant and blown to the ground. Every night, they leave their burrows to gather the sea oat seeds which have blown to the ground, then return them to their burrows for storage. Due to the highly variable climate of coastal habitats, though, several seasonal plants can offer additional food sources throughout the year, such as the beach pea (Galactia spp.), coastal ground cherry (Physalis angustifolia), dixie sandmat (Euphorbia bombensis), tall jointweed (Polygonella gracilis), seaside pennywort (Hydrocotyle bonariensis), seacoast marshelder (Iva imbricata), and evening primrose (Oenothera humifusa). Shelter Burrows tend to be constructed at the base of a clump of grass on the sloping side of a dune, and are occupied by either a monogamous, mating pair of mice or a female and her young. The entrance is a small hole, typically 1-2 inches in diameter, followed by a 3-4 foot tunnel of the same diameter. The tunnel leads to a main chamber, which typically has a second 'escape tunnel' leading out the back. The escape tunnel has no opening at the surface, but ends just below the sand's surface. If the mouse's burrow is invaded or disturbed, the mouse will access the escape tunnel and push through the layer of sand at the end to the surface. These burrows are used for food storage, sleeping, and nesting, as well as a refuge from predators. Reproduction The species is monogamous. Females reach reproductive maturity at 6 weeks and can produce a litter of pups in as little as 20-23 days. The breeding season lasts from November to early January, but can continue throughout the year if climate and food sources are optimal. The average litter of pups is 4, but can range in size from 2-7. Survival Though the average lifespan is 9 months, mortality is high and most young survive around 4 months. The indigenous predators include coastal dwellers such as snakes, skunks, raccoons, and the great blue heron. Some introduced species which pose a threat to the mouse are domestic cats and dogs, as well as foxes.  Reasons for endangered status  Because of the specificity of the dune habitat, the Anastasia Island beach mouse is extremely vulnerable to environmental factors. Because of the high real estate values of the coastal habitat of the mice, major commercial and residential development is continually encroaching on the dunes they call home. Humans become a more regular part of the environment, which contributes both directly and indirectly to the endangerment of the mice. Both by visiting, directly interacting with, and subsequently contributing to the degradation of the dune habitat, as well as bringing their domesticated pets into the environment, thus increasing the threat of introduced predators, the overlapping of human and mouse activity is posing an ever-increasing threat to the relatively defenseless mouse. In addition to direct human contributions, increasing hurricane seasons may also be to blame for the vulnerability of the Anastasia Island beach mouse. The formation of the sandy beach dunes is due largely in part to the presence of coastal grasses and other plants establishing themselves in the sand. As they emerge from the ground, wind begins to pile sand up at the base of the plants. As the plants grow and the wind continues to blow, these piles increase in size and overlap the adjacent piles and, eventually, dunes are formed. This formation process can take large amounts of time, and as hurricanes increase in frequency and severity, the length of time for dunes to recover and reform before the next storm becomes less and less adequate. While the dunes are in the process of regenerating, beach mice must take up residence in intermediate \\"matrix\\" habitat, which is less ideal for their food foraging and burrow establishing than their eventual dune homes. This, also, puts them more at risk of succumbing to environmental factors.  Conservation options  There are several conservation options, at both the governmental and the personal level, that can help preserve and recover the Anastasia Island beach mouse population. Reintroduction is the process of conservationists and park officials setting up a small population of mice in a habitat where it is known to have previously existed. If the potential habitat contains suitable structural features and food sources, and makes the mouse no more susceptible to predators or other potentially harmful factors than their present environment, small populations can be transported and released in the new habitat, with the hopes that they will adjust well and take up residence. Another option is that of translocation. Individuals from large, well- established populations can be trapped, relocated, and released into smaller populations in order to supplement their numbers and increase their genetic diversity. This can not only help boost their population levels, but can actually help the long-term viability of the population by increasing the number of established individuals in the gene pool. This can make the group less vulnerable to diseases and genetic maladies in the long run. As for people who live in the vicinity of the beach mouse habitat, there are several steps they can take to help ensure the longevity of the species. First, they can become familiar with the plants that serve as anchors for the dunes' sand and make an effort not to disrupt the structural integrity of the habitat. In addition to holding the dunes in place, they also serve as food sources for the beach mouse, so to disturb these plants is to put the entire ecosystem at risk. In avoiding these plants, a good rule of thumb is to remain on paths and trails when walking on or near the beach. Another rule for beach living is to keep cats indoors as frequently as one can, and to never feed stray cats on the beach. With domesticated cats being one of the biggest predator threats to the beach mouse, humans should do nothing to encourage their presence in this environment.

Cited in \\"Mersenne's Laws\\", Wolfram.com Mersenne's laws are laws describing the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string or monochord, useful in musical tuning and musical instrument construction. The equation was first proposed by French mathematician and music theorist Marin Mersenne in his 1637 work Trait√© de l'harmonie universelle.Mersenne, Marin (1637). Trait√© de l'harmonie universelle, . via the Bavarian State Library. Cited in \\"Mersenne's Laws\\", Wolfram.com. Mersenne's laws govern the construction and operation of string instruments, such as pianos and harps, which must accommodate the total tension force required to keep the strings at the proper pitch. Lower strings are thicker, thus having a greater mass per unit length. They typically have lower tension. Guitars are a familiar exception to this - string tensions are similar, for playability, so lower string pitch is largely achieved with increased mass per length. Higher- pitched strings typically are thinner, have higher tension, and may be shorter. \\"This result does not differ substantially from Galileo's, yet it is rightly known as Mersenne's law,\\" because Mersenne physically proved their truth through experiments (while Galileo considered their proof impossible).Cohen, H.F.

Mesoscopic physics is a subdiscipline of condensed matter physics that deals with materials of an intermediate size. These materials range in size between the nanoscale for a quantity of atoms (such as a molecule) and of materials measuring micrometres. The lower limit can also be defined as being the size of individual atoms. At the micrometre level are bulk materials. Both mesoscopic and macroscopic objects contain many atoms. Whereas average properties derived from its constituent materials describe macroscopic objects, as they usually obey the laws of classical mechanics, a mesoscopic object, by contrast, is affected by thermal fluctuations around the average, and its electronic behavior may require modeling at the level of quantum mechanics.Sci-Tech Dictionary. McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms. 2003. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc A macroscopic electronic device, when scaled down to a meso- size, starts revealing quantum mechanical properties. For example, at the macroscopic level the conductance of a wire increases continuously with its diameter. However, at the mesoscopic level, the wire's conductance is quantized: the increases occur in discrete, or individual, whole steps. During research, mesoscopic devices are constructed, measured and observed experimentally and theoretically in order to advance understanding of the physics of insulators, semiconductors, metals and superconductors. The applied science of mesoscopic physics deals with the potential of building nanodevices. Mesoscopic physics also addresses fundamental practical problems which occur when a macroscopic object is miniaturized, as with the miniaturization of transistors in semiconductor electronics. The mechanical, chemical, and electronic properties of materials change as their size approaches the nanoscale, where the percentage of atoms at the surface of the material becomes significant. For bulk materials larger than one micrometre, the percentage of atoms at the surface is insignificant in relation to the number of atoms in the entire material. The subdiscipline has dealt primarily with artificial structures of metal or semiconducting material which have been fabricated by the techniques employed for producing microelectronic circuits. There is no rigid definition for mesoscopic physics but the systems studied are normally in the range of 100 nm (the size of a typical virus) to 1 000 nm (the size of a typical bacterium): 100 nanometers is the approximate upper limit for a nanoparticle. Thus, mesoscopic physics has a close connection to the fields of nanofabrication and nanotechnology. Devices used in nanotechnology are examples of mesoscopic systems. Three categories of new electronic phenomena in such systems are interference effects, quantum confinement effects and charging effects.\\"Mesoscopic physics.\\" McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 2005. Answers.com 25 Jan 2010. http://www.answers.com/topic/mesoscopic-physics-1 Quantum confinement effects Quantum confinement effects describe electrons in terms of energy levels, potential wells, valence bands, conduction bands, and electron energy band gaps. Electrons in bulk dielectric materials (larger than 10 nm) can be described by energy bands or electron energy levels. Electrons exist at different energy levels or bands. In bulk materials these energy levels are described as continuous because the difference in energy is negligible. As electrons stabilize at various energy levels, most vibrate in valence bands below a forbidden energy level, named the band gap. This region is an energy range in which no electron states exist. A smaller amount have energy levels above the forbidden gap, and this is the conduction band. The quantum confinement effect can be observed once the diameter of the particle is of the same magnitude as the wavelength of the electron's wave function. When materials are this small, their electronic and optical properties deviate substantially from those of bulk materials. As the material is miniaturized towards nano-scale the confining dimension naturally decreases. The characteristics are no longer averaged by bulk, and hence continuous, but are at the level of quanta and thus discrete. In other words, the energy spectrum becomes discrete, measured as quanta, rather than continuous as in bulk materials. As a result, the bandgap asserts itself: there is a small and finite separation between energy levels. This situation of discrete energy levels is called quantum confinement. In addition, quantum confinement effects consist of isolated islands of electrons that may be formed at the patterned interface between two different semiconducting materials. The electrons typically are confined to disk-shaped regions termed quantum dots. The confinement of the electrons in these systems changes their interaction with electromagnetic radiation significantly, as noted above. Because the electron energy levels of quantum dots are discrete rather than continuous, the addition or subtraction of just a few atoms to the quantum dot has the effect of altering the boundaries of the bandgap. Changing the geometry of the surface of the quantum dot also changes the bandgap energy, owing again to the small size of the dot, and the effects of quantum confinement.Quantum dots . 2008 Evident Technologies, Inc. Interference effects In the mesoscopic regime, scattering from defects ‚Äì such as impurities ‚Äì induces interference effects which modulate the flow of electrons. The experimental signature of mesoscopic interference effects is the appearance of reproducible fluctuations in physical quantities. For example, the conductance of a given specimen oscillates in an apparently random manner as a function of fluctuations in experimental parameters. However, the same pattern may be retraced if the experimental parameters are cycled back to their original values; in fact, the patterns observed are reproducible over a period of days. These are known as universal conductance fluctuations. Time-resolved mesoscopic dynamics Time-resolved experiments in mesoscopic dynamics: the observation and study, at nanoscales, of condensed phase dynamics such as crack formation in solids, phase separation, and rapid fluctuations in the liquid state or in biologically relevant environments; and the observation and study, at nanoscales, of the ultrafast dynamics of non-crystalline materials.

He was the son of Daniel and Purmelia Gillmor, both native of New Brunswick. He was educated at the St. Andrews Grammar School, St. Andrews and later engaged in the local lumber and farming business. Mr. Gillmor married Hannah Dawes Howe, of Maine, in January 1846. They had four children: Daniel, Henry, Percy and Delia. Mr. Gillmor sat in New Brunswick's House of Assembly for five terms, and gained a reputation for integrity. The last of these mandates was as provincial secretary in Albert James Smith's government, which had run on a platform opposing Confederation. When the Smith government was defeated in the 1866 election, Gillmor left politics for a time to concentrate on business. After Confederation, he represented the riding of Charlotte, New Brunswick in the House of Commons of Canada from 1874 to 1896. He was a strong candidate for the office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick in 1899, being strongly endorsed by his former political opponents as well as supporters, but did not secure the appointment. He was subsequently appointed Canadian commissioner to the World's Fair at Paris. He was appointed to the Senate by Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1900, where he served until his death in 1903, when he died on a train in Mattawamkeag, Maine while en route to Ottawa after a return trip to his hometown of St. George. Mr. Gillmor is buried in the St. George Rural Cemetery, in St. George, New Brunswick. His son Daniel also served in the Senate from 1907 to 1918.

Their main area of passenger service has been rapid suburban transit between Valparaiso and Limache, with extended service between Valparaiso and Santiago during the 1980s, and service on the Biotren in the South of Chile since the 2000s. Their maximum speed is 130 km/h (80 mph).  Accidents  There was a major accident at the town of Queronque on February 17, 1986, involving two AES units. It was the largest railroad accident in the history of Chile. Another three AES units were set on fire by terrorists.  Recent Development  In the early 2000s, MERVAL has gradually introduced new UT440R (Unidad de Tren 440 Reformado) railcars, bought second-hand from Spain and refurbished. After operating side-by-side with the AES units for a brief period, they have completely taken over passenger service on June 30, 2005. On that day, AES 17 and AES 3 operated the last MERVAL revenue service between Puerto and Limache, in a large public event that included live music and celebrities. Although the change to the sophisticated, quieter, airconditioned and technologically advanced Alstom X'trapolis units has been met with a very positive public response, there are many Chileans who feel nostalgic about the AES trains that have been part of their daily lives for decades, in the future model AES train, used service especial tourist \\"Train Memory\\".

They connect the Core Sound with the Atlantic Ocean and separate North Core Banks from South Core Banks. The exact inlet locations and names have changed with time, as new inlets open, merge, or close. Conversationally, the inlet or inlets between mile 19 and 23, as measured from Ocracoke Inlet, are typically called Drum Inlet even when, geologically, they have other names. New Old Drum Inlet in 2014: time lapse photograph of a black skimmer (Rynchops niger) with a house on the Dump Island in the background Drum Inlet initially opened at mile 19 in about 1899, but closed naturally by 1919. It reopened during the 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane, but closed by 1971 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged and blasted a new inlet, called New Drum Inlet, at mile 22. The purpose of New Drum Inlet was to allow commercial fishing vessels to access ocean from several small coastal communities; however, the inlet shoaled before any commercial vessels used it.Riggs, S.R., and Ames, D.V., 2007.

In August 1999 Hurricane Dennis reopened the original Drum Inlet, at mile 19, which become New Old Drum Inlet, but it has again closed around 2008. In September 2005 Ophelia Inlet was opened by Hurricane Ophelia, just south of New Drum Inlet, at mile 23. page 12Barrier Island Ecology of Cape Lookout National Seashore, NPS Scientific Monograph No.9, Chapter 3 Over the winter of 2008-2009, all of Drum and New Drum inlets shoaled and closed up, leaving only Ophelia Inlet. In September 2011, Hurricane Irene reopened New Drum (mile 22) and Old Drum inlets (mile 19) and widened Ophelia Inlet (mile 23). Part of the North Core Island between Old Drum Inlet (mile 19) and New Drum Inlet / Ophelia Inlet (at mile 22/23) is referred to as Middle Core Island in the years when Old Drum Inlet is open. Similarly small section of Core Bank between New Drum Inlet and Ophelia Inlet, which existed in years 2005 to 2008, was referred to as New Core Island.

The committee was established to follow on from the investigations into the wrongful accusation of Adolf Beck by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1907. The Devlin report submitted to the committee was made after a number of cases where identity parades led to the mis-identification of a suspect. These included Adolf Beck, Oscar Slater, Luke Dougherty and Laszlo Virag, cases ranging from 1908 to 1972. Although the report uncovered a number of cases where innocent individuals were wrongly convicted, particularly in the case of Laszlo Virag in 1969, who was identified by 8 witnesses despite a plausible alibi, and Luke Dougherty who was picked by 2 witnesses but later cleared under similar circumstances. While the Devlin committee did rule that many witnesses overstated their ability to single out the right person, Professor Glanville Williams commented on the report that: The Devlin committee and its actions were highlighted in the media more recently, in 2005, following the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and the rapid growth of an eye-witness reports that were later found to be exaggerated or false.BBC news article The problem with eyewitnesses, Finlo Rohrer, 24 August 2005.
