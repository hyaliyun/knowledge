It inhabits estuaries, lagoons, and inshore water over seagrass and algae. It feeds on a variety of invertebrates and sometimes small fish. This species can also be found in the aquarium trade. This fish reaches a maximum length of TL. This fish's neck is scaled and both of its dorsal fins have a black spot on the front end. Description The black goby is deeper-bodied than the common goby, sand goby and two-spotted goby with a more rounded snout and generally a larger size. It has two dorsal fins that are almost continuous, the anterior one having six spines, which may project from the fin membrane, and the posterior and shorter one having soft rays. The posterior dorsal fin terminates close to the caudal peduncle in contrast to the common and sand gobies where there is a long gap. The pelvic fins are fused. The colour is some shade of dark brown with indistinct black blotches. The colour of the male becomes almost black during the breeding season and his fins become more vivid. The average size of this fish is about Distribution and habitat The black goby is native to shallow waters in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Its range extends from Cape Blanc in Mauritania to Trondheim in Norway and the Baltic Sea and it is usually found at depths less than . Its typical habitat is lagoons, estuaries and inshore waters, on sandy or muddy bottoms and among seagrasses and seaweeds, and it occasionally moves into fresh water. Behaviour The black goby feeds on small invertebrates on the seabed. It breeds in the summer at which time the male creates a territory in a shallow weedy area and prepares a nest on a clean piece of seabed. He invites the female to inspect it and if she approves, she lays her eggs there and the male guards them until they hatch.

They are mainly used to provide sight-seeing trips for tourists in clear, calm, and often shallow, waters.  Design  The most common design is similar to a ship. The passenger cabin is deep in the hull, a few meters below the waterline. The cabin is equipped with large underwater windows so the passengers can observe the marine environment that is passed during the voyage. There are significant engineering differences between a submarine and a semi-submarine. Submarines are human- occupied pressure vessels exposed to high external pressure, while semi- submarines are exposed to the same pressures as other surface vessels of similar draught operating in similar conditions. As the hydrostatic pressure close to the water surface is relatively low, the viewing windows can be large. In some designs the windows enclose the majority of the immersed hull. Passengers can leave the submerged cabin for the unsubmerged deck at any time.  Use  Semi-submarines can be used for research, but they are most commonly used in the tourism industry. However, large tourism-oriented semi submarines should not be confused with narco-submarines which are smaller home-made semi- submarines used to smuggle drugs.  Legal status  Semi-submarines do not have an international classified status. Their operating range from the native port might be limited by the local authorities.

Statement of the theorem  Consider an ordinary linear homogeneous differential equation of the form :y + q(x)y = 0 with :q: [0,+\\\\infty) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} continuous. We say this equation is oscillating if it has a solution y with infinitely many zeros, and non- oscillating otherwise. The theorem states that the equation is non-oscillating if :\\\\limsup_{x \\\\to +\\\\infty} x^2 q(x) < \\\\tfrac{1}{4} and oscillating if :\\\\liminf_{x \\\\to +\\\\infty} x^2 q(x) > \\\\tfrac{1}{4}.  Example  To illustrate the theorem consider :q(x) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4} - a\\\\right) x^{-2} \\\\quad\\\\text{for}\\\\quad x > 0 where a is real and non-zero. According to the theorem, solutions will be oscillating or not depending on whether a is positive (non-oscillating) or negative (oscillating) because :\\\\limsup_{x \\\\to +\\\\infty} x^2 q(x) = \\\\liminf_{x \\\\to +\\\\infty} x^2 q(x) = \\\\frac{1}{4} - a To find the solutions for this choice of q(x), and verify the theorem for this example, substitute the 'Ansatz' :y(x) = x^n which gives :n(n-1) + \\\\frac{1}{4} - a = \\\\left(n-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^2 - a = 0 This means that (for non-zero a) the general solution is :y(x) = A x^{\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\sqrt{a}} + B x^{\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\sqrt{a}} where A and B are arbitrary constants. It is not hard to see that for positive a the solutions do not oscillate while for negative a = -\\\\omega^2 the identity :x^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\pm i \\\\omega} = \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\ e^{\\\\pm (i\\\\omega) \\\\ln{x}} = \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\ (\\\\cos{(\\\\omega \\\\ln x)} \\\\pm i \\\\sin{(\\\\omega \\\\ln x)}) shows that they do.

It is set in the bayous of Louisiana, and stars Johnathon Schaech, Frederick Koehler, Tamara Braun, Jeremy Davidson, Clifton Collins Jr., and Chris Mulkey. The film completed principal photography in Louisiana in August 2005, just days before Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hit all of the areas they had filmed in. Wolf and Johnson, devastated for the Cajun communities of Southwest Louisiana, were grateful that they could at least give them all this film, celebrating the memory of their land, its beauty and their way of life. Given the loss that so many experienced from these hurricanes, Wolf and Johnson decided to change the ending of the film to one that represented a beacon of hope. Little Chenier premiered at the Austin Film Festival on October 20, 2006 to a standing ovation, filled with Cajuns, Southerners, and Louisianans. It continued on the festival circuit through 2007, winning 10 Best Picture Awards. It was released January 18, 2008 to a successful theatrical run by Radio London Films, then on DVD July 8, 2008. Plot Two brothers are victimized by a weak and jealous man in this drama shot on location in Louisiana. Beauxregard 'Beaux' Dupuis (Jonathan Schaech) lives in the swamps of Cajun country on a small stretch of land called Little Chenier with his younger mentally handicapped brother, Pemon (Fred Koehler). Beaux supports them both by running a bait shop. Beaux is in love with Mary-Louise (Tamara Braun), who has left him to elope with the son of the sheriff, Carl. Neither Carl nor Beaux are fond of each other. Carl also enjoys tormenting Pemon. It is revealed that Mary-Louise left Beaux for Carl when Carl threatened to take her family's property away. When Carl's father is killed in the line of duty, his son takes his place; it isn't long before Carl learns Mary-Louise has been having an affair with Beaux, and he uses his new authority to put Pemon behind bars on false change as a way of punishing Beaux.

Culture and society=Heritage The Asturians have Visigothic, Latin and Hispano-Celtic (Astures) ancestral and cultural origins, most notably found in the Asturian language. Religion Their religious affiliation is predominantly Roman Catholic. Languages The Asturian language, once widely spoken by Asturians, has been in decline since the early 20th century although around 40% of Asturians still speak the language (10% as a mother tongue). Whilst not recognised as an official language in Spain, it is protected under the Autonomous Statute legislation, and efforts to preserve the language continue to be made. In the western part of Asturias, Eonavian (which is a transition language between Galician-Portuguese and Asturian) is also spoken, and its promotion also falls under the responsibility of Law 1/1998.Bauske 1995 Cuisine The most famous regional dish is Fabada Asturiana, a rich stew made with large white beans (fabes), pork shoulder (llac√≥n), morciella, chorizu, and saffron (azafr√°n). Apple groves foster the production of the traditional alcoholic drink, a natural cider (sidra). It is a very dry cider, and unlike French or English natural ciders, uses predominantly acidic apples, rather than sweet or bittersweet. Sidra is traditionally poured in by an expert server (or escanciador): the bottle is raised high above his or her head to oxygenate the brew as it moves into the glass below.  Emigration  In March 2019, it was reported that there are 133,854 Asturians living in 65 countries. Americas Asturians were involved in the development of the New World and their descendants in present- day Latin America, esp. in Argentina and Uruguay; and other countries where Asturians moved to during the rule of the Spanish Empire. The Industrial Revolution came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal and iron resources. At the same time, there was significant migration to the Americas (i.e. Mexico, Cuba and Puerto Rico); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the West Indies and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries. Asturian communities, social clubs, sporting teams, financial banks and amateur vocal groups are still found in Mexico and Argentina as well across South America. Tens of thousands of Asturians moved to the United States en masse, mainly to agricultural industries of FloridaHistory of the Centro Asturiano de Tampa Building and Social Club and California and the zinc smelters of West Virginia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were also involved in working in industrial bases of Midwestern factory towns. (see Asturian-American). A characteristic of the Asturian wherever they go is their attachment to the land of their birth. This is reflected in the 82 Asturian CentersFICA ‚Äì Federaci√≥n Internacional de Centros Asturianos in America.Centro Asturiano de Nueva York Well-known people whose ancestors are Asturian, include Gloria Estefan, Eva Longoria, Vicente Fox, Miguel D√≠az-Canel or Pimpinela.

She was one of the longest-serving cast members of Benny Hill's stock company, appearing on the show from 1977 to his final programme for Thames Television in 1989. Upton also appeared in Benny Hill's World Tour: New York, in 1991. Education and early career Upton attended stage school in addition to her regular education. Despite qualifying at the age of 16 as a teacher of dancing, she decided that a performing career would be more to her liking. After graduation, Upton embarked on a career as a dancer and cabaret singer; she also worked as a model, continuing with this work until she was well into her twenties. She was a member of Love Machine, a female dance troupe. Love Machine went on to appear on three episodes of The Benny Hill Show, where they were a precursor to the later, more famous, Hill's Angels dancers. Although she had left the group before their Benny Hill Show appearances, her stint as a Love Machine dancer first brought her to Hill's attention.Ross, Robert. Benny Hill, Merry Master of Mirth: The Complete Companion, London: B.T. Batsford, 1999 (p.123). The Benny Hill Show Upton auditioned at Hill's flat in the Kensington area of London in 1976, and was hired shortly after. Hill said of her at the time, \\"Sue is really funny. Finding pretty girls who are talented and funny is not easy. And not all girl dancers are pretty. Some of them look like me in drag. Sue is pretty and she is funny.\\"Kirkland, Dennis.

For roughly the first half of her time on The Benny Hill Show, she both danced as a member of the Hill's Angels troupe and acted in comedy sketches. As her tenure with the show lengthened, she moved away from dancing in favor of comic acting only. One of Upton's comic character portrayals was the geriatric superheroine \\"Wondergran\\". In a later episode, she played Stan Laurel to Benny's Oliver Hardy. Behind the scenes, she became the Angels' unofficial \\"shop steward\\" in the show's later years, interceding on their behalf with Hill or with producer Dennis Kirkland when necessary. She also had a hand in the selection of prospective Angels, recommending girls who she thought might be suitable to Hill for auditions.Kirkland, p. 129. During her long association with Hill, their relationship developed from that of employee-to-employer to one of mutual friendship. They were deeply fond of each other, to the extent that Hill's close-knit performing \\"'family' thought Sue could have become Mrs Hill under different circumstances.\\" Hill regularly visited Upton's home every year, becoming friendly with her husband and children as well.Forwood, pp. 150‚Äì154. Other work Upton appeared in two movies: Confessions from a Holiday Camp (1977) and What's Up Superdoc! (1978), both sex comedies. She also appeared in a training film for the British Ministry of Defence. On television, Upton has made guest appearances in several British sketch comedy shows and sitcoms. After Hill's death in 1992, she decided to retire from show business, although she continued to make appearances on TV documentaries speaking about Hill and about her experiences on the show.

It is a secondary chromatin structure which helps to package eukaryotic DNA into the nucleus. Background Chromatin was first discovered by Walther Flemming by using aniline dyes to stain it. In 1974, it was first proposed by Roger Kornberg that chromatin was based on a repeating unit of a histone octamer and around 200 base pairs of DNA. The solenoid model was first proposed by John Finch and Aaron Klug in 1976. They used electron microscopy images and X-ray diffraction patterns to determine their model of the structure. This was the first model to be proposed for the structure of the 30 nm fibre. Structure DNA in the nucleus is wrapped around nucleosomes, which are histone octamers formed of core histone proteins; two histone H2A-H2B dimers, two histone H3 proteins, and two histone H4 proteins. The primary chromatin structure, the least packed form, is the 11 nm, or ‚Äúbeads on a string‚Äù form, where DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes at relatively regular intervals, as Roger Kornberg proposed. Histone H1 protein binds to the site where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome, wrapping 147 base pairs around the histone core and stabilising the nucleosome, this structure is a chromatosome. In the solenoid structure, the nucleosomes fold up and are stacked, forming a helix. They are connected by bent linker DNA which positions sequential nucleosomes adjacent to one another in the helix. The nucleosomes are positioned with the histone H1 proteins facing toward the centre where they form a polymer. Finch and Klug determined that the helical structure had only one-start point because they mostly observed small pitch angles of 11 nm, which is about the same diameter as a nucleosome. There are approximately 6 nucleosomes in each turn of the helix. Finch and Klug actually observed a wide range of nucleosomes per turn but they put this down to flattening. Finch and Klug's electron microscopy images had a lack of visible detail so they were unable to determine helical parameters other than the pitch. More recent electron microscopy images have been able to define the dimensions of solenoid structures and identified it as a left-handed helix. The structure of solenoids are insensitive to changes in the length of the linker DNA. Function The solenoid structure's most obvious function is to help package the DNA so that it is small enough to fit into the nucleus. This is a big task as the nucleus of a mammalian cell has a diameter of approximately 6 ¬µm, whilst the DNA in one human cell would stretch to just over 2 metres long if it were unwound. The \\"beads on a string\\" structure can compact DNA to 7 times smaller. The solenoid structure can increase this to be 40 times smaller. When DNA is compacted into the solenoid structure can still be transcriptionally active in certain areas. It is the secondary chromatin structure that is important for this transcriptional repression as in vivo active genes are assembled in large tertiary chromatin structures. Formation There are many factors that affect whether the solenoid structure will form or not. Some factors alter the structure of the 30 nm fibre, and some prevent it from forming in that region altogether. The concentration of ions, particularly divalent cations affects the structure of the 30 nm fibre, which is why Finch and Klug were not able to form solenoid structures in the presence of chelating agents. There is an acidic patch on the surface of histone H2A and histone H2B proteins which interacts with the tails of histone H4 proteins in adjacent nucleosomes. These interactions are important for solenoid formation. Histone variants can affect solenoid formation, for example H2A.Z is a histone variant of H2A, and it has a more acidic patch than the one on H2A, so H2A.Z would have a stronger interaction with histone H4 tails and probably contribute to solenoid formation. The histone H4 tail is essential for formation of 30 nm fibres. However, acetylation of core histone tails affects the folding of chromatin by destabilising interactions between the DNA and the nucleosomes, making histone modulation a key factor in solenoid structure. Acetylation of H4K16 (the lysine which is the 16th amino acid from the N-terminal of histone H4) inhibits 30 nm fibre formation. To decompact the 30 nm fibre, for instance to transcriptionally activate it, both H4K16 acetylation and removal of the histone H1 proteins are required. Further packaging Chromatin can form a tertiary chromatin structure and be compacted even further than the solenoid structure by forming supercoils which have a diameter of around 700 nm. This supercoil is formed by regions of DNA called scaffold/matrix attachment regions (SMARs) attaching to a central scaffolding matrix in the nucleus creating loops of solenoid chromatin between 4.5 and 112 kilobase pairs long. The central scaffolding matrix itself forms a spiral shape for an additional layer of compaction. Alternative models Solenoid model (left) and two- start twisted- ribbon model (right) of 30 nm fibre, showing DNA only. Several other models have been proposed and there is still a lot of uncertainty about the structure of the 30 nm fibre. Even the more recent research produces conflicting information. There is data from electron microscopy measurements of the 30 nm fibre dimensions that has physical constraints which mean it can only be modelled with a one-start helical structure like the solenoid structure. It also shows there is no linear relationship between the length of the linker DNA and the dimensions (instead there are two distinct classes). There is also data from experiments which cross-linked nucleosomes that shows a two-start structure. There is evidence that suggests both the solenoid and zig-zag (two-start) structures are present in 30 nm fibres. It is possible that chromatin structure may not be as ordered as previously thought, or that the 30 nm fibre may not even be present in situ. Two-start twisted-ribbon model The two-start twisted-ribbon model was proposed in 1981 by Worcel, Strogatz and Riley. This structure involves alternating nucleosomes stacking to form two parallel helices, with the linker DNA zig-zagging up and down the helical axis. Two-start cross-linker model The two-start cross-linker model was proposed in 1986 by Williams et al.. This structure, like the two- start twisted-ribbon model, involves alternating nucleosomes stacking to form two parallel helices, but the nucleosomes are on opposite sides of the helices with the linker DNA crossing across the centre of the helical axis. Superbead model The superbead model was proposed by Renz in 1977. This structure is not helical like the other models, it instead consists of discrete globular structures along the chromatin which vary in size. Some alternative forms of DNA packaging The chromatin in mammalian sperm is the most condensed form of eukaryotic DNA, it is packaged by protamines rather than nucleosomes, whilst prokaryotes package their DNA through supercoiling.

The differential equation is called oscillating if it has an oscillating solution. The number of roots carries also information on the spectrum of associated boundary value problems.  Examples  The differential equation :y + y = 0 is oscillating as sin(x) is a solution.  Connection with spectral theory  Oscillation theory was initiated by Jacques Charles Fran√ßois Sturm in his investigations of Sturm‚ÄìLiouville problems from 1836. There he showed that the n'th eigenfunction of a Sturm‚ÄìLiouville problem has precisely n-1 roots. For the one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation the question about oscillation/non- oscillation answers the question whether the eigenvalues accumulate at the bottom of the continuous spectrum.  Relative oscillation theory  In 1996 Gesztesy‚ÄìSimon‚ÄìTeschl showed that the number of roots of the Wronski determinant of two eigenfunctions of a Sturm‚ÄìLiouville problem gives the number of eigenvalues between the corresponding eigenvalues. It was later on generalized by Kr√ºger‚ÄìTeschl to the case of two eigenfunctions of two different Sturm‚ÄìLiouville problems. The investigation of the number of roots of the Wronski determinant of two solutions is known as relative oscillation theory.

Written by Peter Curran and David Williams and directed by Ken Turner, it was first broadcast on 12 March 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, the Mysterons target a mine extracting a rare metal vital to the construction of a new Earth space fleet. Plot A new space fleet is being built to enable Earth to take the \\"war of nerves\\" directly to the Mysterons. To shorten the journey time to Mars, the Space Administration is fortifying the ships with tritonium metal, enabling them to travel faster while tolerating the proportionately higher stresses. Tritonium is found only at the North Pole, where it is being extracted from the ocean floor by the Hotspot Tower mining facility. When the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) threaten to sabotage the space fleet, Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) sends Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) to the Space Administration Headquarters in New York City to be briefed by the head of the Administration, General Rebus. Scarlet and Blue then travel to the Arctic to assess the security at Hotspot Tower. The controller, Rhodes, tells them that the lake around the tower and its undersea mine is prevented from freezing by giant heating elements powered the by electricity from Eskimo Booster Station. Unknown to Scarlet, Blue and Rhodes, a maintenance technician, Neilson, has been killed in a blizzard and replaced with a double under Mysteron control. On the orders of Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray), the double travels to Eskimo and cuts the power to the heating elements. The rapidly-freezing lake forms a \\"noose of ice\\" that threatens to crush the mining facility. With Hotspot Tower's lifts inoperative, Scarlet puts on a diving suit and leaves the mine via an airlock, avoiding decompression sickness as he ascends to the surface of the lake. He then proceeds to Eskimo, where Neilson holds him at gunpoint. As Neilson shoots him, Scarlet throws a loose high-voltage cable at the metal staircase on which Neilson is standing, fatally electrocuting the Mysteron agent. Though wounded, he manages to restore the power to the heating elements, melting the ice and saving Hotspot Tower. However, the Mysterons have had a partial success: the facility is severely damaged and will be out of operation for at least six months.

Parts of the Hotspot Tower filming model, which was designed by effects assistant Mike Trim,Bentley 2017, p. 92. were built to a scale larger than normal for Century 21, which enabled the creation of more realistic special effects.Bentley 2001, p. 38. The miniature model representing the Space Administration building was a re-use of the SHEF Headquarters from \\"Point 783\\". Elements of the Hotspot Tower control room first appeared in the film Thunderbirds Are Go (1966), while the interior of Eskimo Booster Station was partly based on the Skyship One Gravity Compensation Room from Thunderbird 6 (1968). Some of the incidental music was originally composed for Stingray and Thunderbirds. Scenes re-using music from these series include Neilson's death in the blizzard and shots of ice forming around Hotspot Tower.Bentley 2001, p. 81. The puppet playing Neilson was first seen as Captain Brown in \\"The Mysterons\\". \\"Noose of Ice\\" marks the third occasion in the series where this puppet's character is killed and reconstructed by the Mysterons: it previously appeared as Mysteron agents Major Reeves in \\"Renegade Rocket\\" and Professor Carney in \\"Codename Europa\\". The puppet also appears as Charlie Hansen in \\"Fire at Rig 15\\", Dr Conrad in \\"Flight 104\\" and a bartender in \\"Special Assignment\\". The puppet playing General Rebus also appears as the Base Concord Commander in \\"Renegade Rocket\\" as well as in non-speaking background roles in \\"Special Assignment\\" and \\"Seek and Destroy\\". The Hotspot Tower guard was previously Jason Smith in \\"Fire at Rig 15\\", while the puppet that plays Commander Rhodes would later appear as the regular character Sam Loover in Joe 90. Reception Andrew Thomas of Dreamwatch magazine considers \\"Noose of Ice\\" to be one of the best episodes of Captain Scarlet. He praises the episode for highlighting the vulnerability of Scarlet, as a former Mysteron agent, to electricity: \\"there is a very real danger that Scarlet may be electrocuted when re-connecting the power supply.\\" Geoff Willmetts of the website Sfcrowsnest describes the episode, with its \\"freezing water\\", as \\"one of the cleverest from a special effects point of view\\". Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine calls the episode \\"superlative in the miniatures department\\". Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of Starburst magazine regard the electrocution of Neilson as one of the series' more violent moments.

Robert Brown, PhD; honorary degree (1874) Biography Brown was born in Camster, Caithness, and studied in the universities of Edinburgh, Leyden, Copenhagen, and Rostock. He took the habit of referring to his home town, Campster (Campsterianus), to distinguish himself from his famous contemporary of the same name: Robert Brown of Montrose. He visited Spitzbergen, Greenland, and the western shore of Baffin Bay while still an undergraduate, and subsequently carried on scientific investigations among the islands of the Pacific and on the Venezuelan, Alaskan, and Bering shores, leading an expedition to map the interior of Vancouver Island and writing much on the fauna and flora of those countries. Exploration and travel Brown arrived at Fort Victoria in early 1863 to explore the Colony of Vancouver Island. Later that year, he explored from Barkley Sound to Kyuquot. The following year he accepted the leadership of the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition, a venture which covered about 2000 km over four and a half months. The expedition named many of the mountains, rivers and lakes of Vancouver Island.; members of expedition, which included Frederick Whymper as its artist, insisted that Browns River be named after him. They found gold at the Leech River, causing much excitement, but the results were limited to $60,000. Brown attributed more importance to their discovery of coal in the Comox Valley. He took an interest in Chinook jargon. With Edward Whymper, brother of Frederick, he attempted to penetrate the inland ice of Greenland in 1867, and made many discoveries concerning its nature which were later confirmed by Robert Peary. He traveled in the Barbary States of North Africa, and became the foremost British authority on Morocco almost by accident, having gone there for a holiday but having found himself unable to enjoy idleness. Lecturing and writing Before he was 30 years old Brown had written over 30 academic papers and an advanced textbook on botany, in addition to more popularising works. He wrote up his Vancouver Island travels and was awarded a doctorate based on this by the University of Rostock in 1869. He was a lecturer on geology, botany, and zoology in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and was a member of many learned societies in England, America, and on the Continent. He was president of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, and a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society. Brown moved to London in 1876 and spent the rest of his life writing, earning his living as a journalist. In addition to botany, he also wrote prolifically on zoology, geology, and geography, for both learned and popular audiences. One example of this ability to write for generalists and specialists is the extensive commentary he contributed to an 1896 reprint of the 1807 slave narrative of John R. Jewitt, in which Brown reflects on the changes in the lives of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast from the time of the first European explorers in the late eighteenth century, to Maquinna's chiefdom and Jewitt's captivity, to his own explorations in 1863, when intertribal warfare was still rife, to the situation in the mid-1890s, by when many of the nations were on the brink of extinction. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Brown's 1886 book Spunyarn and Spindrift, A sailor boy‚Äôs log of a voyage out and home in a China tea-clipper contains the earliest known usage in print of Gadget.Michael Quinion: World Wide Words: Gadget (accessed 6 February 2008) Also in: Michael Quinion: Port Out, Starboard Home: The Fascinating Stories We Tell About the Words We Use.

Early life He was the eldest of three sons of William Henry Abbey, a brewer, and was named John Rowland before dropping the 'w'. He attended Windlesham House School, Brighton from 1907 to 1909 but was subsequently educated in nearby Rottingdean by a private tutor, Mr M√∂ens, after an accident caused permanent damage to one of his elbows. Military career In November 1914, at the start of World War I, he was commissioned as a regimental officer in the Rifle Brigade, serving for two years on the Western Front in the 13th and 8th Battalions. He experienced a lucky escape as part of the 8th Battalion; while he was serving in reserve, the battalion took part in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, losing all officers but one. He was gassed in November 1916 and spent five months recovering in hospital before being invalided out in October 1917 and demobilised in 1919. His younger brother Lieutenant Noel Roland Abbey was killed on the Western Front in April 1918 while serving with the Grenadier Guards. Abbey later rejoined the Rifle Brigade in November 1939, and served from 1941 to October 1943 as staff officer to the Admiral-Superintendent at Great Yarmouth. He left the army in 1943 and was awarded the honorary rank of Major in 1946. Personal life After the war he became manager of the Kemp Town brewery, succeeding his father as chairman in 1943 and merging the company with Charringtons in 1954. On 7 June 1921, he married Lady Ursula Cairns, daughter of Wilfred Cairns, 4th Earl Cairns, with whom he had two daughters. In 1945, he was appointed High Sheriff of Sussex, a position he held for a year. Book collecting John Ronald Abbey bookplate Abbey would become the largest English book collector of his time. His book collecting started in 1929 buying books from various private presses, eventually gaining complete collections of books from the Kelmscott, Ashendene and Gwasg Gregynog presses. He also became interested in modern bindings, and in 1931 commissioned examples from Sybil Pye and, from R. de Coverley & Sons, a copy of Siegfried Sassoon's Memoirs of an Infantry Officer decorated with Abbey's coat of arms. He also collected antiquarian books, starting from the sale of Primrose's collection and building it up from 1936 to 1938 thanks to sales from the Mensing, Moss, Aldenham, Schiff, and Cortlandt F. Bishop collections, eventually holding over 1,300 books. He died on 24 December 1969 in London, and, with the exception of manuscripts given to his family and a group of books donated to the Eton College Collections, his remaining texts were sold for ¬£993,509 between 1970 and 1975.Catalogue of The Celebrated Library of (The Late) Major J.

Weiss (Georgia Institute of Technology) and Russell Cropanzano (University of Colorado) to explain how emotions and moods influence job performance and job satisfaction. The model explains the linkages between employees' internal influences (e.g., cognitions, emotions, mental states) and their reactions to incidents that occur in their work environment that affect their performance, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. The theory proposes that affective work behaviors are explained by employee mood and emotions, while cognitive-based behaviors are the best predictors of job satisfaction. The theory proposes that positive-inducing (e.g., uplifts) as well as negative-inducing (e.g., hassles) emotional incidents at work are distinguishable and have a significant psychological impact upon workers' job satisfaction. This results in lasting internal (e.g., cognition, emotions, mental states) and external affective reactions exhibited through job performance, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Alternatively, some research suggests that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between various antecedent variables such as dispositions, workplace events, job characteristics, job opportunities, and employee behavior exhibited while on the job (e.g., organizational citizenship behaviors, counter-productive work behaviors, and job withdrawal). To that end, when workers experience uplifts (e.g., completing a goal, receiving an award) or hassles (e.g., dealing with a difficult client, reacting to an updated deadline), their intention to continue or quit depends upon the emotions, moods, and thoughts associated with the satisfaction they derive from their jobs. Other research has demonstrated that the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover is fully mediated by intention to quit; workers who report low job satisfaction are likely to engage in planned quitting. However, this relationship does not account for employees who report high job satisfaction, but quit unexpectedly. Although extrinsic rewards, such as better job offers outside their current organization, may influence their decisions, employees' personality factors may also impact their decisions to exit early from otherwise ideal jobs under ideal working conditions. Recipients often refer to specific events in exit interviews when voluntarily leaving their current jobs. Minor events with subtle emotional effects also have a cumulative impact on job satisfaction, particularly when they occur acutely with high frequency. For example, perceived stressful events at work are often positively associated with high job strain on the day that they occur and negatively associated with strain the day after, resulting in an accumulation of perceived job-related stress over time. This is consistent with the general understanding in vocational psychology that job satisfaction is a distal, long-term outcome that is mediated by perceived job stress.  Factors affecting employee experience at work  The relationships between components associated with work (e.g., tasks, autonomy, job demands, and emotional labor) and their impact on job outcomes support AET. Tasks that are considered challenging, rewarding, or that provide an opportunity to develop new skills induce positive affect and increase job satisfaction. Alternatively, tasks that are rated as routine, boring, or overwhelming are associated with negative affect (e.g., low self- esteem, low self-confidence) and concerns over job evaluations. This may lead workers to engage in planned quitting behaviours. The degree of autonomy workers have in their jobs affects their productivity, satisfaction, and intention to quit. Research shows that the ability to make decisions and influence what happens on the job has the greatest impact on job satisfaction, particularly among young male workers. Job autonomy even trumps income's effect on job satisfaction. Alternatively, work overload significantly reduces job satisfaction among middle-aged women and men but does not significantly impact job satisfaction among young male workers. These differences between the age and gender of workers indicate differences in career phase, where young (male) workers are more likely to put up with or expect work overload, while middle-aged workers tend to be approaching their peak and may expect some concessions (e.g., based on track record, merit, or currency to the organization). Likewise, work flexibility affects job satisfaction. In fact, the flexibility to decide when work is performed ranks number one among women and number two or three among men in determining the characteristics of a satisfying job. Similar to job autonomy, job flexibility is more important than income when evaluating job satisfaction. Flexibility to determine one's work schedule is an important contributor to job satisfaction across the spectrum of low- and high-income jobs. Work flexibility empowers employees by reducing the incidence of work-family conflicts and engagement in planned quitting to improve overall quality of life. Positive affect is a fringe benefit of work flexibility that pays rich dividends to both employees and their employers, empowering the former and improving the ability of the latter to retain workers. Past research has suggested that workplace affect was a state-oriented construct (like emotions and mood) that depended upon the work environment or situations encountered at work. However, more recent research describes affect as a dispositional trait that is dependent upon the individual. Structures of mood and personality and their relevance to assessing anxiety, with an emphasis on self-report. Although workplace events have a significant impact on employees, their mood largely determines the intensity of their reaction to events experienced at work. This emotional response intensity tends to affect job performance and satisfaction. Other employment variables, like effort, leaving, deviance, commitment, and citizenship, are also affected by positive and negative perceptions of events experienced at work. General cognitive ability (also known as 'g') and personality also influence job performance. Emotion and cognition help to explain Organizational Citizenship Behaviours (OCB). For example, emotions about one‚Äôs job (i.e., job affect) are strongly associated with OCBs directed at individuals, while one‚Äôs thoughts or job cognitions are reportedly more strongly associated with OCBs directed at the organization. The outcome of how satisfied an individual employee is with her/his job within the organization may depend upon how s/he perceives an incident experienced at work. Job satisfaction also depends upon the emotions and thoughts associated with that perception, as well as the social support provided by co-workers and the organization as a whole.  Five factor model of personality  Personality research on the five factor model (FFM) supports AET. The FFM is a parsimonious model that distinguishes between differences among individuals‚Äô dispositions. This is done on the basis of five factors, each of which contains six underlying facets. Self-reported measures of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion consistently predict affect and outcome from events experienced at work. There is some evidence that other personality factors predict, explain, and describe how employees may react to affective events experienced at work. For instance, maladaptive traits derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual correlate with work-related affect, but the incremental validity that these traits explain is minimal beyond the FFM.  Conscientiousness  In general, conscientiousness concerns delayed gratification. As a personality trait, conscientiousness involves regulating impulsiveness by following methodically determined plans to achieve nonimmediate goals. Of the five factors, conscientiousness is considered the best predictor of training and job performance and occupational attainment. Conscientiousness is demonstrated through employee industriousness, self-initiative, self-discipline, orderliness, and time management. It positively predicts intrinsic (i.e., job satisfaction) and extrinsic (i.e., compensation and benefit) career success. Accomplishment of complex tasks is correlated with high conscientiousness and general cognitive ability. Intention to leave an organization is less influenced by extrinsic reward than perceived procedural fairness, which is highly important to conscientious workers Perceptions of the conscientiousness of others may also influence intention to provide assistance at work. Investigations examining the impact of the interaction between low performing members' g and conscientiousness on team-level prosocial behavior demonstrates that other team members are likely to exhibit high prosocial behavior when the poor performer is perceived to have low g and high conscientiousness or high g and high conscientiousness. Team members exhibit moderate levels of prosocial behavior when the poor performer exhibits low g and low conscientiousness. When the poor performer is perceived to have high g and low conscientiousness, other team members exhibit the least amount of prosocial behavior. Conscientiousness and emotional stability predict low employee turnover and high job performance, indicating that these personality traits are robust and should be assessed during personnel selection in subsequent validation and utility analysis. Conscientiousness is considered to account for possible moral, ethical, and contractual obligations that may lead to employee turnover. In this mental state, employees high in conscientiousness may decide to demonstrate high organizational commitment due to transactional fairness in accordance with the norms of reciprocity, as long as a perceived debt exists. Highly religious and conscientious workers may believe that quitting goes against their work-oriented beliefs (e.g., the Protestant work ethic), with any volition to carry through with quitting, a sign of poor character.  Agreeableness  Individuals who are high in agreeableness exhibit prosocial behaviors, are cooperative, compassionate, and polite, and show sincere concern for the welfare and rights of others. Research links agreeableness with empathy and theory of mind to explain the emotions, intentions, and mental states of others. Agreeable workers are valued employees; their agreeableness is a key factor in maintaining their social relationships. Their tendency to strive toward integration, inclusion, and solidarity with others supports group cohesion. They tend to be helpful and concerned for the welfare of others. Agreeable workers also tend to experience high job satisfaction compared to less agreeable workers. Workers high in agreeableness tend to rate themselves as high in intrinsic motivation, particularly when work performed on behalf of others or an organization is considered. Heterogeneity of personality is important in team productivity, particularly where agreeableness is involved; having complete agreeableness among all members of a team is negatively related to performance as it tends to lead to groupthink. The relationship between agreeableness and job satisfaction is most apparent in exchange-oriented or transactional work environments. When workers who are low in agreeableness are satisfied with their work environment and those they are required to interact with, they are likely to engage in prosocial organizational citizenship behaviors. Low-agreeable workers are likely to disengage in such behaviors when they find the work environment less favourable. Highly agreeable workers, on the other hand, are likely to engage in prosocial organizational citizenship behaviors regardless of the work climate, environment, or disposition of others they are required to work with, since they tend to focus more on the needs of others and the organization as opposed to keeping track of transactions. Further, deviant behavior is higher among workers low in agreeableness, particularly when organizational support is low. Agreeableness and Conscientiousness have been consistently linked to organizational citizenship behavior, although this relationship is weak. Recent research suggests that agreeableness acts as a moderator that affects workers' experienced states of citizenship behavior. These two personality traits are also negatively correlated with employee turnover. Workers who self-report as low on agreeableness are likely to engage in unplanned quitting, leading to a condition known as the \\"Hobo Syndrome\\" (i.e., habitual job quitting).  Neuroticism  Individual sensitivity to punishment is at the core of neuroticism. Numerous findings show that neuroticism is related to the tendency to experience negative affect at work and other social environments. Neurotic individuals exhibit irritability, anxiety, impulsiveness, and self-consciousness that seems to underlie a general sensitivity to threat and punishment. The authors of the NEO-PI-R indicate that poor emotion regulation, low self-esteem, and excessive rumination are common among neurotic individuals. The underlying anxiety implied by neuroticism is linked to emotional instability, which is typically important in predicting employees' intentions to quit. Low emotional stability is also linked with intention to quit for reasons other than job dissatisfaction or poor job performance. Neuroticism is the best predictor among the Big Five personality traits of negative job satisfaction. For example, neuroticism negatively predicts extrinsic (i.e., compensation and benefit) success. This is why conscientiousness (a great predictor of positive job performance and job satisfaction) and neuroticism (the best predictor of negative job satisfaction) are regularly used in personnel selection and personnel psychology. Neuroticism explains significant variation in mood and job satisfaction among workers.  Openness to experience  Openness to experience is exhibited through mental abstraction and flexibility in perception. Non-linear thinking is enabled through the use of imagination, intellectual curiosity, and an appreciation for aesthetics, all of which are core facets of this personality factor. Employees assessed as high in openness to experience generally score high on tests of general cognitive ability and demonstrate high abilities in information processing, working memory, abstract reasoning, and focused attention. Workers high in openness to experience are more likely to engage in unplanned quitting. However, this finding may have little to do with affect derived from events experienced at work. Individuals who self-report as high in openness to experience may be impulsive, but their decisions to suddenly quit may be due to the value placed on job diversity, need for change, exploration of other interests, intolerance for routine and boredom, and an underlying sense of curiosity. Openness to experience does not appear to predict or explain job satisfaction.  Extraversion  Extraversion is considered to be responsible for individual sensitivity to reward. It is extraversion's underlying facets of assertiveness, sociability, and talkativeness that are reported to be related to approach tendencies within individuals toward either intrinsic or extrinsic rewards. Like most human activity, the currency of the world of work involves rewards. High sensitivity to reward seems to be synonymous with extraversion, making workers who exhibit high extraversion likely to be highly motivated and highly productive in independent and collaborative work. This is particularly heightened when work involves supervision of others, management of resources, or leadership. Extraverts tend to experience more positive affect, perceive themselves more positively, and recall more positive than negative work events compared to introverts. Intention to quit among extraverts is less dependent upon procedural fairness within the organization, particularly when the opportunity for social rewards at work is perceived as high. Conscientiousness and extraversion are the best predictors of positive job satisfaction.  Mood  Workers' mood influences their job performance and job satisfaction. Hedonic tone explains most of the variation in how an event at work affects a worker's internal state (i.e., mood) and how this state is expressed to others. Even though positive events are reported three to five times more often, negative events have approximately five times the impact on mood. An inverse relationship exists between hedonic tone and work affect, with hedonic tone negatively related to work performance and positively related to work withdrawal. Workers are likely to be selfless and more altruistic when positive events occur, such as compliments, open acknowledgement of a job well-done, and promotions (which, in turn, seem to improve job performance). Negative events at work, however, are likely to cause negative mood in employees, resulting in negative work behaviours such as work slowdowns, work withdrawal, and absenteeism. Mood may be moderated by organizational commitment which, in turn, may affect workers' decisions to stay or quit. For example, workers may suppress their true feelings and choose to dissociate their mood at work if they are high in continuance organizational commitment (i.e., committed due to social or economic costs of leaving). The same may be true for workers who are high in affective organizational commitment, which is typically the case for workers who are highly affiliated with their organizations (e.g., workers who have a family history of working for the same organization or who believe deeply in the organization's values or cause). Similarly, workers who are high in normative organizational commitment feel they have to put up with less-than-favourable work environmental conditions because of contractual obligations. Research demonstrates that employee mood is a strong predictor of job satisfaction. Neuroticism and extraversion explain a lot of the variation in individual differences in job satisfaction, with variation in mood and job satisfaction accurately predicting an individual worker's level of neuroticism. There is also some indication that individuals may be predisposed to perceive events that occur at work as either negative or positive. The effect of positive events on job satisfaction is weaker among workers with high negative mood predisposition than those with low negative mood predisposition. This predisposition to either be optimistic or pessimistic about job satisfaction may frame the job even before positive or negative events occur at work. To rule out the possibility of hiring personnel who come to the job with a negative outlook, the personality of potential employees should be evaluated through the use of standardized self- report personality inventories (e.g., NEO-PI-R) during the hiring process. Highly conscientious, agreeable, or extraverted personnel tend to be more satisfied with their jobs and, by extension, tend to stay longer in organizations. Alternatively, organizations may develop their own structured interview questions with behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) that provide further convergent validity on critical predictors of job performance (e.g., neuroticism). Such inventories, interviews, and tests must be reliable and valid in order to demonstrate their utility and legal defensibility in support of the selection and hiring process.  Mitigating negative affect experienced from work-related events  The intensity of negative affect experienced at work often leads to work withdrawal, absenteeism, vandalism, and early exit. Organizations continually seek to select, train, and retain employees through incentives, compensation, benefits, and advancement. Such mechanisms influence the organizational commitment demonstrated by employees. Organizational commitment suggests that employees self-identify with their employers; the more individuals identify with their employing organizations, the more likely they are to support the organization and act in its best interest. Of the three components of organizational commitment (i.e., affective, continuance, and normative), affective organizational commitment is correlated with experiencing more positive affect at work. This organizational commitment style has a greater impact on affect than individual personality factors and traits. This finding supports organizational psychological findings indicating that employee identification with the organization is based upon their affective commitment. In fact, there is a stronger correlation between positive emotions and affective commitment than between positive emotions and job satisfaction. The decision to continue working for an organization, however, does not seem to be dependent upon negative affect. Other factors, such as debt, pension implications, and future job prospects outside of the organization, must also be considered. Negative affect experienced through events at work may be related to changes in work performance, such as work withdrawal and absenteeism, as well as job satisfaction, but it does not seem to be the deciding factor on whether or not an employee will leave the organization. Psychosomatic complaint and health concerns due to emotions experienced at work Research suggests that poor physical, mental, and emotional health can result from negative emotions experienced at work. This may be due to perfectionist dispositional tendencies that interact with daily hassels manifested through psychosomatic complaints. Workers who experience frequent thoughts of needing to be perfect tend to report more psychosomatic complaint. Psychosomatic complaint may also occur as a response to emotional dissonance caused by the need to suppress one's true feelings toward co-workers and more so toward patients, students, customers, or clients. Emotional labour or emotion work is required to achieve the effect required by the organization. As a consequence, workers may 'act' as opposed to 'feel' positive or negative emotions at work to remain compliant with an organizational code of conduct. However, adherence to such organizational norms may belie the true internal state of the individual worker. Authenticity and emotional harmony in such situations, may yield to dissonance and negatively impact on workers' health. The resulting emotional dissonance may lead to increased stress symptoms and a general decrease in overall health. Job satisfaction is negatively correlated with the need to suppress negative emotions on the job.  Emotions at work  Emotions play an important role in how co-workers respond to poor performers. Emotions have a stronger influence than either expectancies or attributions in predicting behavioral intentions toward poor performing team members at work. In turn, this could spread to affect the emotions of other team members toward poor performance through contagion. Emotional outcomes have been shown to be depend upon whether workers are promotion- or protection-focused at work. Promotion-focused workers tend to exhibit eager risk-taking toward opportunities to demonstrate competence in order to accumulate gains, whereas protection-focused workers are inclined to show emotions that are more vigilant toward defending against erosion of their perceived credibility. Feeling good about one's job is not as strongly associated with overall job satisfaction as the need to work as a function of one's continuance commitment. Feedback and motivation Performance feedback has an important influence on employee affect. Regular performance reviews are a well-established occurrence in most medium- to large-scale organizations. The type of performance feedback provided by supervisors and managers can affect subsequent employee performance and job satisfaction. Employees tend to rate a leader's effectiveness as low when leaders provide failure feedback with negative affect in feedback sessions. Similarly, team members tend to provide lower quality performance ratings on their collective tasks when negative affect accompanies failure feedback by leaders.

It was among the most significant builders of water- cooled aircraft engines before World War I. Company history=1910-21 The company was founded in 1910 by Californians Elbert J. Hall and Bert C. Scott to manufacture gasoline-powered rail cars. Hall was a mechanic and engine builder and Scott, a Stanford University-educated, was the business executive. They produced their first rail car in 1909, which they sold to the Yreka Railroad. In 1910, a factory was opened in Berkeley, California, with headquarters for a short time in San Francisco. The company built interurban electric railway cars for railroads such as the electrified Sacramento Northern, which ran trains from adjacent Oakland to Sacramento and Chico. The rail car business was slow, but some were sold as far away as China. In 1910, Hall-Scott also began manufacturing aircraft engines for commercial and military aviation. These engines possessed a remarkable power-to-weight ratio for the era, using an overhead cam, overhead valves, hemispherical combustion chamber, and extensive use of aluminum. Their various engine types shared parts and dimensions, reducing cost. Hall helped Jesse G. Vincent of Packard design the famous Liberty airplane engine, which has a number of features that are discernibly Hall-Scott. Even so, Hall-Scott was too small to participate in the manufacture of the Liberties. 1921-45 Around 1921, Hall-Scott dropped its aero engine and rail car product lines, and expanded into building engines for tractors, trucks, boats, and stationary applications. The firm produced several hundred thousand two-speed rear axles, the Ruckstell Axle, for Ford's Model T through the mid-1920s. In 1921, E. J. Hall began developing the valve system of Duesenberg racing engines and developed new cam lobe profiles that improved engines' reliability and power output. His research provided an understanding of the importance of the gradual opening and closing of valves and the effect this had on valve spring durability in high-speed engines. The designs he specified gave Duesenberg an immediate advantage and were quickly copied and applied to all high-speed engines using poppet valves, which continued to the present day. This work was done in Berkeley, suggesting that Hall may have used his company's resources.The Golden Age of the American Racing Car, Griffith Borgeson, Bonanza, New York, 1966, PP123 In 1925, the company was purchased by American Car and Foundry, which used its engines in its buses and boats. 1931 saw the introduction of the Invader marine engine, one of the firm's most famous and important products. The company survived the Depression and then attained its highest production rates and employment numbers in World War II by building engines for a variety of military products, including a tank retriever, the M-26/M-26A1, and the Higgins boat (LCVP). 1945-60 Some post-World War II ACF-Brill buses manufactured in Philadelphia and purchased by Greyhound and Trailways were equipped with Hall- Scott engines. Its last all-new motor, the 590, came out in 1954. That year, ACF divested itself of Hall-Scott, which became independent as Hall-Scott, Inc. Annual engine sales remained below 1,000 in the 1950s, so the company sought revenue by purchasing a number of firms outside engine making. This had little effect on the bottom line, and so in 1958 Hall-Scott sold its engine division to Hercules Motors Corporation and closed the Berkeley plant. The final engines bearing the Hall-Scott name were produced by Hercules in Canton, Ohio, in the late 1960s. In 1960 Hall-Scott disappeared as a discrete company when the non-engine division of the company merged with Dubois Holding Company.

His family background had been in fine jewellery, cutlery and the gun trade. He coined the motto, \\"to be the maker of as good a gun as can be made\\" which is still used. Richards was an innovator, creating a number of gun-related patents. The most significant were the patent relating to the use of a new waterproof primer for the ignition of percussion guns and also the first flip-up sight, which went on to be used by the British Army. Richards opened a gun store in London in 1815 on New Bond Street. The store was owned and managed by William Bishop, known as the Bishop of Bond Street. Westley Richards' Cavalry carbine, 1865 Control of the gunsmith company was inherited by Westley Richards, eldest son of the founder.

Since the municipal merger, the two towns started to share a marketplace and center. Today the towns form the greater town of Heeswijk-Dinther. Etymology In 1139 Dinther was named first as Dinthre . The name has an Old Frankish origin and is a composition of the words \\"Dint\\" and \\"haar\\". \\"Dint\\" (or \\"dent\\") means \\"dent\\" or \\"dented\\" usually it implies a landscape with rolling heights. \\"Haar\\" is an old Dutch word for a long stretchted sand dune. Indeed there lies a long stretchted sand dune between the city of Berlicum and Veghel to the north of Dinther. It seems correct to translate Dinther as: \\"dented long stretchted sand dune\\" (source: \\"Grepen uit de geschiedenis van Dinther 1139‚Äì1989\\", J. van der Leest). The current landscape though is green and does not show any signs of dunes or sand. History Parish of Dinther in the 19th century In the early Middle Ages the first acres were cultivated out of fertile woodlands along the river \\"Aa\\". In the early Middle Ages Dinther was part of a free territory governed by the Lords of Dinther; as were the nearby towns of Heeswijk and Boxtel. In 1196 half of this territory was granted in use by Knight Albert van Dinther to the Lord of Cuijk. The Lord of Cuijk granted the use to the Duke of Brabant. The Lords of Dinther probably resided in a stronghold on an artificial hill called \\"Ter Borch\\". This stronghold was most likely situated near the river Aa, to the south of Dinther. In 1388 the other half of this territory was granted in use by \\"Willem van der Aa\\" to \\"Duchess Johanna van Brabant\\", which turned it into a part of the Duchy of Brabant. Dinther was part of the Meierij of 's-Hertogenbosch one of the four administrative parts of the Duchy of Brabant. In 1352 Dinther became an acknowledged town when \\"Jan van Benthem\\", Lord of Dinther, granted the inhabitants of the parish the use of the land. In the 14th century the residence of the Lords of Dinther moved from \\"Ter Borch\\" to the estate of \\"Ten Bogaerde\\". This was situated near the castle Avestein. Avestein was torn down in 1807. former Town hall Dinther After the end of the Protestant Reformation in 1648 Dinther became part of the States of Brabant for the \\"Meierij van 's-Hertogenbosch\\" became part of the States of Brabant. The Protestants repressed the catholic faith in Dinther until 1795. Repressing is a strong term. In reality a manner of coexisting between Catholics and Protestants was daily practice.

Pappas Schools were a series of related alternative schools located in the Phoenix, Arizona area. A part of the Maricopa County Regional School District, the Thomas J. Pappas schools provided primary and secondary education to homeless children in the area. They were named for Thomas J. Pappas, a prominent Phoenix businessman known for his strong support of homeless causes, who died in 1989. The schools closed in 2008 following several years of controversy and legal issues surrounding the schools' administrator, Sandra Dowling, the Maricopa County Superintendent of Schools. History The early beginnings of the school can be traced to a volunteer effort by Phoenix firefighters prior to 1989 of providing tutoring classes to local homeless children. Originally held in a shelter and later moved to a hotel, the first classes were attended by only 8 students.The Maricopa County Schoolhouse Foundation \\"Pappas Kids\\" Funding and resources were non-existent in the early days of the program and In an effort to determine whether the small fledgling volunteer effort could be stabilized and expanded into an official program, a group of local firefighters contacted Sandra Dowling, the newly elected Maricopa County School Superintendent . Realizing that homeless students were not receiving appropriate education services through the local school district, Dowling and the firefighters worked with the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) to change the plight of what turned out to be thousands of children over a twenty-year span. In 1990 Dowling founded the Thomas J. Pappas School for Homeless Children using the limited resources provided through state funding opportunities, federal grant monies and community donations to develop an official curriculum and provide school facilities for homeless children. A local Episcopal church housed the first classrooms before growth of the program in less than one academic year quadrupled the number of students requiring services. The move to a former car dealership that was leased and then renovated for use as a school for grades K-8, Dowling's program becoming the first school for the homeless children in Phoenix and evolved into a national model. In response to continued growth in attendance a new school was constructed in 1997Phoenix Points Of Pride serving grades 1-6 and the existing former \\"car dealership\\" was building was converted to a middle school. The concept was further expanded by the founding of the Tempe Thomas J. Pappas Elementary School in nearby Tempe in 2001. While originally housed in a strip mall, the satellite school moved into a new facility constructed in 2004. The Pappas Schools enjoyed the support of national, state, local and religious community leaders. Players from all of the local sports organizations visited and volunteered at the school. Players would don chef hats and aprons and serve meals for major holidays including Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. They would be seen on campus's on a regular basis playing on the playground with the children or being a \\"classroom helper\\" for the day. The school thrived with the help of volunteer organizations such as the Creative Women of Pinnacle Peak, Rotary and Lions clubs, volunteers from local retirement communities and other school children in more prosperous school districts that wanted to help. Retirees from as far away as Sun City, Pebble Creek and Apache Junction would drive weekly and sometimes daily to be a reading coach for the students. Corporate and community sponsors included Salt River Project, Nationwide Vision, Arizona Diamondbacks, Phoenix Suns and Arizona Cardinals. United Airlines sponsored annual fantasy flights for students annually. Contributions from all over Arizona and throughout the United States allowed the school to have an on-site medical center that provided medical, vision and dental care. Volunteer doctors and dentists provided care to many students for the first time in their young lives. Students had an opportunity to visit the \\"birthday closet\\", take home food from the food pantry on a regular basis or to visit \\"The Gap\\", the on-site clothing room that provided clean clothes and a new pair of shoes for the children as needed. Political issues and closure As alternative schools that did not operate under established geographical school districts, the Thomas J. Pappas schools never enjoyed funding from a traditional school tax district. The Maricopa County Schoolhouse Foundation was established as a 501C-3 charitable foundation to organize fundraising activities to support the schools. Severe financial issues created concern as to the future of the Pappas schools. In 2006, it was discovered the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors had diverted and withheld more that $3.8 million in funding to the school. In an attempt to conceal the funding scheme, county leadership led by County Manager David Smith, enlisted the assistance of the Sheriff and alleged that Dowling misappropriated the funds instead. A massive legal and public battle ensued that led to an investigation into certain accounting practices called into question a number of officials related to the school. During the court proceedings it was discovered and entered into the court records that county leaders and the Sheriff \\"lied, misled and distorted evidence\\" presented to the grand jury. Counts that were remanded back to the grand jury were never refiled and the remaining counts were dismissed and Dowling and other leaders that had been targeted were exonerated. However, the public fight took its toll on the district's leadership and teachers, fearing they would not get paid, were taking other job opportunities. . Judicial intervention and an outpouring of support from local charities secured the schools for a brief time. Questions regarding the school's financial stability continued well into 2007. In spite of financial help from outside sources the school continued to operate at a deficit because the Maricopa County finance department refused to allow the county treasurer to pay employees or vendors. As a result, by October the school district had racked up a debt of an estimated $2.9 million. Although funds were in school district accounts to make the required payments, without approval from the Board of Supervisor's the Treasurer was not allowed to issue payment. Attempts to solve the school's political battles with Dowling did not succeed, and on October 18, 2007, a settlement was approved that would require the closure of all 3 Pappas schools by June 30, 2008. Students attending Pappas schools were expected to register at more traditional schools following the closure date. Dowling did not to run for re- election as county schools superintendent in the wake of the Pappas Schools controversy and her ongoing related legal issues. Dowling was eventually cleared of all charges. She sued Maricopa County for bringing false charges against her and was awarded a cash settlement in 2013. In 2009, she received a written apology published on the editorial page of the state's largest newspaper, The Arizona Republic for their coverage of the events12 The \\"witch hunt\\" against Dowling has been extensively documented and reported on by many leading publications in the state. She now enjoys being involved in political activities again, her role as an educational leader and business owner in the community. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors closed the Thomas J. Pappas Schools in 2008. The Tempe campus presently houses a public charter school. The Phoenix campus, once listed as a Point of Pride by the city, was demolished in March 2011.

This is an adoption from when French Canadian settlers first built farms and streets in the area. Many streets have French names in result, such as Lauzon Parkway, Marentette Avenue (a quiet residential street), Ouellette Avenue (considered by many Windsorites to be its \\"Main Street\\"), and Pelissier Street. The current street system of Windsor (grid with elongated blocks) reflects the French method of agricultural land division where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river (this originates from French methods of tax collection, with more taxes being paid by property owners with waterfront properties, thus why riverfront lots were usually narrow).  Introduction  Most of the city is uniform in its grid, but a few neighbourhoods have their own system. Forest Glade and The Villages of Riverside were built recently (in the 1960s and 1970s, and have circular patterns, while Sandwich has its own grid roughly 45 degrees off from the rest of the city, in a triangle from Huron Church Road and the Detroit River, south to Tecumseh Road and Prince Road. This is due to the river turning southwest- ward just west of the Ambassador Bridge. Another major part of the city where the streets \\"jog\\" across Tecumseh Road is Fountain Bleu, when Tecumseh Road was the former city limit with the former Township of Sandwich South until the 1960s.  Expressways  Windsor has one freeway, the E. C. Row Expressway. Highway 401 skirts the City Limits from Provincial Rd (exit 14). to Cabana West/Todd Lane (exit 6), and enters the city in the far west end to Ojibway Pkwy. (exit 1). A former spur, Highway 3B, now known as Dougall Parkway is a limited access freeway between the 401 and Howard Avenue. Just north of Howard Avenue, Dougall Parkway becomes Dougall Avenue. There are a few other divided highways/dual carriageways with varying levels of development, access, and intersections, such as Ojibway Parkway, Lauzon Parkway, Ouellette Avenue, and Huron Church Road.

Overview In describing the idea of information markets, Mcgee and Prusak (1993)McGee, James and Lawrence Prusak. 1993. Managing Information Strategically. John Wiley and Sons, New York. pp 12, 58 note that people barter for information, use it as an instrument of power, or trade it for information of greater value. In contrast, Shapiro and Varian (1999)Shapiro, Carl and Hal R. Varian. 1999. Information Rules. Harvard Business School Press, Watertown, Massachusetts. p22, 30 point out that historical leaders in information markets, such as newspapers and encyclopedias are at risk of losing their positions as new technology greatly reduces the cost of creating and distributing information. They also indicate that information markets will not resemble textbook competitive markets with many suppliers offering similar products but lacking the ability to influence prices. In describing the transition from traditional to information markets, Simard (2005)Simard, Albert J. 2005. Global Disaster information network. In: UN World Conference on Disaster Reduction, Kobe, Japan. used a metaphor of autonomous providers and users exchanging information in place of sellers and buyers trading goods and services, respectively. Martin (1996)Martin, James. 1996. CYBERCORP: The new Business Revolution. Capital Press, Washington District of Columbia. Page 74 indicates that as manufacturing shifts from mass production to customization, marketing should shift to individualization. Similarly, Mcgee and Prusak (1993) state that with the increased capacity for customization, information about products and services will become an increasingly important resource. Hagel and Rayport (1997)Hagel, John and Jeffrey F. Rayport. 1997. The Coming Battle for Customer Information. In: Harvard Business Review (Jan, 1997) focus on customer relations. Although businesses assume that information about customers is freely available for the taking, as customers assume greater control of this information, access will likely become more difficult. Further, as ownership of information shifts to the customer, a new source of supply is created and there may be opportunities for intermediaries to add value by linking this supply with business demand. Although Web-enabled information markets resemble the frontier-style \\"old west\\", Sparr (2001)Sparr, Debora L. 2001. Ruling the Waves. Harcourt, Inc. New York. pages 22, 373 states that governments will eventually find ways to step in with standards, property rights, and regulations, as all economic activity ultimately depends on order. This has virtually always been the case in the past and there is no reason to expect that the Net will be different. For Linde and Stock (2011)Linde, Frank and Stock, Wolfgang G. (2011). Information Markets. A Strategic Guideline for the I-Commerce. Berlin, New York, New York: De Gruyter Saur. the information market is the market for digital information distributed via networks. Traded are all sort of software applications and of content (from blogs via images, films and games up to scientific articles and patents). I-Commerce is the e-commerce with (digital) information.

Similar to autocross, the goal of gymkhana is to achieve the fastest time possible; memorizing the course is a significant part of achieving a fast time. The name is loaned from the equestrian discipline of gymkhana. Gymkhana events are time and/or speed events in an automobile. These can feature obstacles such as cones, tires, and barrels. The driver must manoeuver through a predetermined \\"track\\" performing many different driving techniques. What separates gymkhana from traditional autocross events is that the gymkhana requires drivers to perform reversals, 180 degree spins, 360 degree spins, parking boxes, figure 8s, and other advanced skills. Drifting is also encouraged where helpful or necessary. Essentially, a gymkhana is any event featuring a starting point, a finish line and some sort of \\"obstacle\\" to get through, around, or by, all within a certain time limit. Drivers The driver's goal is to get through the course as quickly as possible with the fewest mistakes. Acceleration, braking, drifting, and grip driving are all necessary. Not only does the driver have to hold control over the car, but gymkhana requires strong mental concentration and memorization.  History  Gymkhana was started using the horse, long before the car was invented. Racers had to pick up small flags to win in the Genghis Khan's races. Native Americans raced on harsh courses to show their bravery. Those who were eligible for these events were limited. Gymkhana became friendly and festive events.Eric, Baxter. \\"How Gymkhana Works.\\" HowStuffWorks. N.p., 17 Nov. 2009. Web. 04 Mar. 2016.  Courses  Gymkhana courses typically involve only the use of first and second gear, where autotesting in the UK and Ireland add the use of reverse gear. A gymkhana course will typically be from 0:45 to 1:30 in length. Like autocross and autotesting, gymkhana courses are laid out with cones representing \\"obstacles\\" to navigate through. Unlike autocross, which can be considered to be a small version of a road course, obstacles in gymkhana will often consist of slaloms, 180 degree turns, 360 degree turns, figure eight turns and sometimes parking boxes. Gymkhana requires strong mental concentration and memorization of the track, as sections of the course frequently must be repeated or navigated backwards and or differently. The driver will use many techniques to effectively navigate a course. Handbrake technique, drifting and sliding and Left-foot braking are all necessary skills for gymkhana. Competition format As the JAF is a subsidiary of the FIA, FIA classing is used for Gymkhana in Japan. Gymkhana courses may be used for an entire year, unlike autocross and autotesting where drivers are presented with a new course for each event. Gymkhana participants are allowed two runs of the course, with the fastest time being used to determine the winner of a class. Time penalties are issued for hitting cones, and a failure to navigate the course correctly results in no time score. National structure Gymkhana in Japan has a well- defined competition structure, with everything from local to national competitions. Drivers can compete in official events locally in order to qualify for regional events and so on. Japan has an All Japan Gymkhana competition each year. Despite being governed under the FIA in Japan, there is no official international gymkhana competition at this time. Drivers in official events may be required to hold a JAF-issued competition license.

The anime was directed by Kimio Yabuki and written by Makoto Tsuji, Tadaki Yamazaki, Hisao Okawa, Tatsuo Tamura, Hiroyasu Yamaura and Keisuke Fujikawa. It aired on NET TV from October 15, 1975 to June 28, 1982. The series was received by all ages in Japan and throughout Asia, as it is mostly non-violent. Even when violence appears, it is usually presented in a mild or necessary way (for example, there are occasional references to the ≈ånin War). In 1976, there was also a theatrical film released as part of the Toei Manga Matsui film festival in the summer of that year.  Summary  Ikky≈´-san (‰∏Ä‰ºëÂÆóÁ¥î, Ikky≈´ S≈çjun) was born in 1394 in Kyoto. He was the son of Emperor Go-Komatsu-tenno and Mrs. Iyo. Ikkyu and his mother had to leave the palace because of the political problem of Japan. When he was 5 years old, he was separated from his mother and was sent to be ordained at Ankoku-ji Temple. Great artistic liberties are taken with regards to the depiction of Ikkyu's cartoon version and his real-life counterpart. In the anime, he is so cute and very neat. In the series, Ikky≈´ relies on his intelligence and wit to solve all types of problems, from distraught farmers to greedy merchants. A running gag of Ikky≈´-san is that whenever Ikky≈´ is trying to think of a plan, he sits in a lotus position, wets his two index fingers, and rotates them above his head. In fact, he is a person who has different ideas from people around him so Mr. Ka-so has appointed his senior as Abbot instead of him. He decided to travel to various locations which gave him an opportunity to meet many famous artists and poets. Ikkyu was appointed as the abbot at the Daitoku-ji temple to restore it after destruction. He returned to the Ankoku-ji Temple , which is the last place where he lives, before he died at the age of 87 years in 1481.

Prince Andrew Andreevich became the first of the Romanovs to visit Russia after the revolution and the overthrow of their dynasty. He also took part in the Battle of the Atlantic, Operation Torch, and the landing of the Allies in Normandy. At the end of the war, he was serving in the Pacific. After demobilisation in 1946, he returned to England.  Life in America  After the end of the war, Andrew Andreevich became an intern on an English farm in Kent, learning to become an agronomist. He also worked in a special garden near London. Finding no further prospects in Europe, after the invitation in 1949 of his uncle Prince Vasily Alexandrovich, along with his cousin Prince Nikita Nikitich, and having only 800 dollars in his pocket, he emigrated to the United States on a cargo ship carrying racehorses, pigeons, and eight passengers. After settling in California, he started working in a store, then worked with his uncle at California Packing, where he grew tomatoes using hydroponics and worked on the introduction of new varieties of vegetables. He studied sociology and criminology at the University of California at Berkeley. Then he worked as a broker in a shipping company and spent three years in Japan and Korea. Returning to San Francisco, Andrew Andreevich became a real estate agent. He also worked as a simple employee and designer. He became a naturalised US citizen on 20 December 1954. After the death of his second wife, he moved to the city of Inverness, Marin County, California, where he worked as a carpenter and joiner and later was engaged in a jewellery business. He began to draw as a primitive artist, without formal art education, drawing pictures by intuition and relying on imagination. Andrew Andreevich also engaged in artistic photography. After retirement, he devoted himself entirely to art. On his preferred medium of Shrinky Dinks (plastic sheets that shrink by two- thirds when cooked in an oven), he draws and paints, shrinks the inimitable scenes, then mounts them on painted panels. Andrew's artwork is firmly rooted in the traditions of American folk art. His work typically depicts personal memories, impressions of American news, culture, and scenes of domestic life. Currently, Andrew Andreevich lives with his wife, the American painter Inez Storer, in Inverness. They reside in a house that is 110 years old, during which time it has been a tourist hotel and a private home. In 2007, he released an autobiography called The Boy Who Would Be Tsar, which is illustrated with his artwork. His work has been exhibited worldwide, including recent exhibitions at Gallery 16 in San Francisco. Marriages and children Prince Andrew has been married three times. He was married firstly in San Francisco on 9 September 1951 to Elena Konstantinovna Dourneva (5 May 1927, Tokyo ‚Äì 31 May 1992, Oakland).

It specifies the latency for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. It is typically measured in multiples or fractions of a second.

Engineers usually report both the maximum and average delay, and they divide the delay into several parts: * Processing delay time it takes a router to process the packet header * Queuing delay time the packet spends in routing queues * Transmission delay time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link * Propagation delay time for a signal to reach its destination A certain minimum level of delay is experienced by signals due to the time it takes to transmit a packet serially through a link. This delay is extended by more variable levels of delay due to network congestion. IP network delays can range from a few milliseconds to several hundred milliseconds.

He is the founder and artistic director of the American Baroque Orchestra. Bailey specializes in Slavic music of the 17th and 18th centuries, in addition to baroque, classical, and romantic repertoire, and is the current director of the Yale Russian Chorus. Bailey frequently guest conducts ensembles such as the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Cappella Romana, The Portland Baroque Orchestra and Pro Coro Canada. He often gives presentations on Slavic baroque music and historical performance practice, and has been a principal guest speaker for the Great Performers series, the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center in New York City, the 2016 Musicking Conference at the University of Oregon, and the Indiana University International Performance Practice Conference. Born and raised outside Rochester, New York, Bailey began his musical studies in viola and piano at an early age, and started singing through his involvement in the Eastman Children's Chorus. While concentrating in vocal performance and piano as an undergraduate, he began to study conducting with David Effron. As a graduate student he changed his focus to this field, studying conducting (and Liturgy and Russian) at Yale. Later he continued his conducting studies with Harold Farberman. Upon graduation Bailey worked as an assistant conductor while leaning toward Russian romantic and 20th century repertoire, opera, and Orthodox sacred music. In the 1990s he met baroque violinist Jaap Schr√∂der, and began to study period performance practice. In 2011 Bailey founded the American Baroque Orchestra (ABO), an authentic period instrument orchestra that performs throughout New England. The Summer of 2016 marks the inaugural Choral Festival of ABO, featuring works of Antonio Vivaldi and Jewish Baroque composer Salamone de Rossi, the latter reflecting the specialization of associate artistic director Kevin Sherwin. Bailey's former conducting positions have included artistic and music director of the New Haven Oratorio Choir and Orchestra, the Westchester Concert Singers, The New England Benefit Orchestra, and The Festival Chamber Orchestra at Yale. He was the assistant conductor of the Eastman Philharmonia, the opera department at the Eastman School of Music, and for the Heidelberg Castle Opera Festival in Heidelberg, Germany. As a baroque violist, Bailey most recently founded the Musica Vera Duo in 2015, with guitarist and conductor Kevin Sherwin. Bailey has also appeared as a violist with the American Baroque Orchestra, the Arcadia Players, Northampton, Massachusetts, The Sebastian Players in Connecticut, and Schola Cantorum at Yale University. His compositions and arrangements have been performed by Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, which commissioned several works from Mr. Bailey for their 2011-2012 season opener, and other works of his have premiered at Lincoln Center, Yale University, Boston‚Äôs Emmanuel Church, and throughout the United States, as well as at St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral in Moscow, Russia. Approximately forty of his compositions have been published. Bailey has won praise for his leadership of the Yale Russian chorus. His first recording with the YRC in 1996 was placed on The New York Times critics‚Äô choice list and described as a must-have recording by National Public Radio‚Äôs Performance Today. Mark Bailey's most recent recording, \\"Heart of Kyiv,\\" is a compilation of Slavic works from the 17th and 18th centuries with Mr. Bailey leading Pro Coro Canada. Among the many outstanding reviews of Mr. Bailey's concerts, City Arts of Seattle wrote of the Rachmaninoff All- Night Vigil, \\"Bailey elicited expressive phrasing that enhanced every detail of the text‚Äôs meaning\\" (September 2015). Another performance with Cappella Romana: \\"the choir followed Bailey‚Äôs detailed, expressive direction with rapt focus‚Ä¶they sounded like one solitary living creature, the expansion and contraction of the music coming as naturally as breath\\" (Northwest Reverb). From 1992 to 2008, Bailey served on the faculty of St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York, where he taught composition, analysis, choral leadership, and Church Slavonic. He also served on the conducting staff for the chapel choirs, and he founded the Composers Seminar at St. Vladimir‚Äôs in 2007 and 2008. Bailey continues to teach and conduct Orthodox sacred music at various conferences and seminars throughout North America. He teaches conducting and performance practice to a select number of students, and is a Fellow at Davenport College, Yale University. Bailey is currently the Head of Historical Sound Recordings at Yale University. Outside of music, Mr. Bailey is extensively involved in animal welfare and, in 2013, was appointed as a Connecticut state commissioner for the Animal Welfare Task Force.COMMISSION ReferencesExternal links *Yale Russian Chorus Official Website *American Baroque Orchestra Official Website Category:American male composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:American choral conductors Category:American male conductors (music) Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:American violists Category:21st-century American conductors (music) Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Mark Bailey (conductor)"},{"id":"10145699","text":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 73, adopted on August 11, 1949, noted with satisfaction the Armistice Agreements between the parties involved in the 1948 conflict in Palestine and then expressed the hope that a final settlement of all questions outstanding between the parties might be achieved soon.

The bill was widely supported by a number of national law-enforcement organizations, such as the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the National Sheriffs' Association. The legislation failed to pass the Senate, in part due to opposition from some African-American and Hispanic-American organizations, such as the National Council of La Raza. The proposed legislation pursued two principal goals: *Designate \\"High Intensity Gang Areas\\" and authorize funds to combat gang activity in those areas. *Define gang crime in the federal code and specify punishments for gang-related crimes and other violent crimes.

Family George Berkeley, baptized 26 October 1601 at Low Leyton, Essex, was the only surviving son of Sir Thomas Berkeley (11 July 1575 ‚Äì 22 November 1611) and Elizabeth Carey, daughter and sole heir of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon. He was the grandson of Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley (d. 26 November 1613), by his first wife, Katherine Howard (d. 7 April 1596), third daughter of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Frances de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford and Elizabeth Trussell.. Career Berkeley's childhood was spent in Warwickshire, where he was a pupil of the translator, Philemon Holland of Coventry, and of Henry Ashwood.. He succeeded to his titles of Baron Berkeley of Berkeley, Mowbray, Segrave, & Breuse of Gower at the death of his grandfather, Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley, on 26 November 1613.Due to a confusion of the first and second creations of the title Baron Berkeley, George Berkeley is sometimes cited as the 13th Baron rather than the 8th. His family seat was at Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire. He was made a Knight of the Order of the Bath on November 4, 1616, when Prince Charles was made Prince of Wales. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and received his M.A. degree from the university in 1623. He was made a member of the Council of Wales and the Marches in 1633. Berkeley supported a range of important writers in the Jacobean and Caroline eras. A number of significant figures dedicated their works to him in gratitude for his patronage‚Äî;or in hope of receiving it. These included Robert Burton, who dedicated The Anatomy of Melancholy to Berkeley upon its publication in 1621. Berkeley was a notable patron of English Renaissance drama: Philip Massinger dedicated his play The Renegado to Berkeley on its 1630 publication, as James Shirley did his The Young Admiral in 1637. John Webster dedicated The Duchess of Malfi to Berkeley in 1623. The wording of Webster's dedication suggests that Webster was seeking Berkeley's patronage rather than acknowledging support already given; it is not known to what degree the supplication was effective. Through both his own and his wife's families Berkeley was connected with established traditions of support for literature. His maternal grandfather had backed the Lord Chamberlain's Men, the acting company of William Shakespeare. Berkeley himself has been described as \\"a friend of the King's Men.\\"Kinney, Arthur F., ed. Renaissance Drama: An Anthology of Plays and Entertainments. London, Blackwell, 1999; p. 566. His wife was connected to Katherine Stanhope, the dedicatee of Massinger's The Duke of Milan. At his death in 1658, Berkeley was succeeded as 9th Baron Berkeley by his second son, also named George Berkeley. (Note: members of the Berkeley family, the descendants of Robert Fitzharding, are usually referred to by the Berkeley surname. The 8th Baron is George Berkeley in many sources. In his own era, however, in the dedications of contemporaneous works such as The Duchess of Malfi, he is identified as George Harding.)Dedication to The Duchess of Malfi Retrieved 18 March 2013.

It belongs with Garmisch-Partenkirchen as district capital and cultural center as well as other municipalities to the region Werdenfelser Land. A few kilometers south runs the German-Austrian border. The village, together with Mittenwald and Wallgau, builds the tourism network Alpenwelt Karwendel who markets the holiday region throughout the year as a starting point for sports and recreational activities such as hiking and cross-country skiing. Kr√ºn was in 2015 host-community of the G7 summit. It took place on 7 June and 8 June 2015 in Schloss Elmau, which belongs as a separate district to the municipality of Kr√ºn.http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2014/10/2014-10-13-g7-gipfel- elmau.html (publication by the Federal Government of Germany, in German) On the occasion of the G7 summit US-President Barack Obama visited the village together with Chancellor Angela Merkel and her husband.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/07/merkel-obama-beer- sausage-breakfast-g7-summit  Geography  Kr√ºn is located in the Upper Isar Valley, about 100 kilometres south of Munich and 15 kilometres east of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It is located 6 kilometres north of Mittenwald and 2 kilometres south of Wallgau. To the east, the Soiern Mountains rise with the Soiernspitze (2257 m above sea level. NN) and the local mountains Sch√∂ttlkarspitze (2050 m above sea level. NN), Seinskopf (1961 m above sea level. NN) and Signalkopf (1895 m above sea level. NN). In the southeast, above Mittenwald, the Karwendel Mountains extend. The Karwendel is also the eponym of the tourist region, with average heights of about 2300 m above sea level. NN . In the southwest, the Wettersteingebirge dominates the scenery. It locates the highest German mountain, the Zugspitze (2964 m above sea level. NN) and the distinctive Alpspitze (2628 m above sea level. NN). In the northwest, lying in the Estergebirge, is the highest point of the village, the mountain Klaffen (1829 m above sea level. NN). East of Kr√ºn, the river Isar flows in a northerly direction at first. The crossover passage to the Walchensee and the corresponding hydroelectric plant runs through the town towards Wallgau.  History  Kr√ºn was first mentioned in 1294 with two farmsteads belonging to the Benediktbeuern Abbey. In 1491, the monastery sold the village with now four farmsteads to the Bishopric of Freising. Since the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, Kr√ºn was part of the Electorate of Bavaria. The village was part of the former County of Werdenfels until 1803. In the course of administrative reforms in the Kingdom of Bavaria, the contemporary municipality was formed.BHStA, KL Benediktbeuern 32 2015 G7 summit: Schloss Elmau in Kr√ºn Coat of arms A golden mitre with dependent tapes on a red ground with a silver pike pole and a silver crosier diagonally crossed. The colors red, gold and silver represent the two spiritual manors of the Convent Benediktbeuern (red / silver) and the Bishopric of Freising (red / gold) as well as the political affiliation of the former County of Werdenfels. The mitre also symbolizes the dominion of Freising, the crosier the dominion of Benediktbeuren. The pike pole documents the importance of timber rafting for the village and its economic development during the past centuries.http://www.hdbg.eu/gemeinden/web/index.php/detail?rschl=9180122 (in German)  Economy and Infrastructure  As in the whole region, tourism is the main industry in Kr√ºn. In 2013, 51 accommodation establishments offered 1,379 guest beds (including camping) and 365,983 overnight stays demonstrate the importance of tourism for the municipality. There were 120,326 more overnight stays in private houses in the same year.https://www.statistik.bayern.de/statistikkommunal/09180122.pdf (in German)  Traffic  Kr√ºn is located on the German Alpine Road. The federal highway No. 11 runs in a northerly direction via Wallgau and Walchensee to Kochel am See. The location is well served by public transport with both official bus routes and the rail network of the Deutsche Bahn. The railroad from Munich to Innsbruck passes the municipal station in the village of Klais. For holidaymakers there is also a bus network that can be used with the holiday region's guest card for free. The busses approach some hiking trails and alps in the summer and ski resorts and cross-country ski trails in the winter.  Lakes  In the proximity of Kr√ºn there are several small lakes like Barmsee, Geroldsee, Grubsee and Tennsee. At the southern end of the village is an artificial lake of the river Isar. By here, a channel branches towards the Walchensee and so supplies the well-known Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station.

She is known for her development of the first effective remedies for Haemophilus influenzae infection, as well as being one of the first scientists to identify and study antibiotic resistance.  Early life and education  Alexander was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and graduated from Goucher College in 1923. She worked for the United States Public Health Service and the Maryland Public Health Service, and then enrolled at Johns Hopkins University medical school, where she received her M.D. in 1930.  Career  In 1932, she became an instructor and researcher in the Department of Pediatrics at Columbia University, where she spent her entire professional career. In the early 1940s, Alexander began researching Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), at the time an almost invariably fatal disease in infants and young children. From 1941-1945 she served as a consultant to Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson on the Influenza Commission. She developed an improved antiserum for the disease; by combining antiserum therapy with the use of sulfa drugs, and developing standardized techniques for diagnosis and treatment, she and her associate Grace Leidy helped reduce the mortality rate from Hib from nearly 100 percent to less than 25 percent. Later, Alexander and Leidy studied the effect of antibiotics on Hib, finding streptomycin to be highly effective. The combined use of the antiserum, sulfa drugs, and antibiotics significantly lowered the mortality rate from Hib. In the course of her research on antibiotics, Alexander noted and reported the appearance of antibiotic- resistant strains of Hib. She concluded, correctly, that this was caused by random genetic mutations in DNA which were positively selected through evolution; she and Leidy demonstrated the occurrence of transformation in the Hib bacillus, leading to resistance. She died of liver cancer in New York City in 1968.  Awards and honors  Alexander received numerous honors and awards for her work, including the E. Mead Johnson Award (1942), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award (1956), and the Oscar B. Hunter Memorial Award (1962). In 1964, she was elected president of the American Pediatric Society. She was the first women to be elected to this position.

Dinah visits the fictional community of Hayslope ‚Äî a rural, pastoral and close-knit community in 1799. She says to Lisbeth Bede in Chapter Ten, \\"I work in the cotton-mill when I am at home.\\"Eliot 100. She lives thirty miles away in the fictional Snowfield, in the fictional Stonyshire County. Description She is a cousin by marriage of Hetty Sorrel and related to the Poysers. Rachel Poyser, her aunt, wishes Dinah would stay with them in Hayslope. Dinah is deeply religious, a follower of Wesleyan Methodism. She lives to comfort others, including Adam Bede's mother when her husband is drowned. She offers to help Hetty if she is ever in need. When Hetty commits her crime and cannot own up to it, Dinah's presence allows Hetty to face what she has done and ask for forgiveness. At the beginning of the novel, Dinah lives at the Poyser farm because she is Mrs. Poyser's niece. Though she is an attractive woman, she seems to show no signs of self-consciousness while she preaches. In fact, she is sometimes considered to be Eliot's most confident female character. According to Diana Neill, \\"The plot [of Adam Bede] is founded on a story told to George Eliot by her aunt Elizabeth Evans, a preacher, and the original of Dinah Morris of the novel, of a confession of child-murder, made to her by a girl in prison.\\"Neill 208. Dinah's preaching is extremely effective, persuading the exceptionally vain Bess to take off her gaudy earrings -- though only briefly. Her resistance to marriage, because she worries it would curtail her religious teaching, is resolved by Eliot in a manner calculated not to upset the male hierarchy:Martin 745. Dinah was not in fact kept from a traditional marriage by piety, but because no man she truly loved had yet asked her to marry him. Indeed, she turns into a typical housewife by the end of the novel, even consenting to discontinue her preaching because the Methodist men have decided against it.Gates 412.

Its main goal was to defend liberal democracy against totalitarian ideologies on the far right and left, and it chiefly opposed the Sturmabteilung wing of the Nazi Party and the Antifaschistische Aktion wing of the Communist Party of Germany. Formally independent, it was intimately associated with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The Three Arrows, originally conceived for the Iron Front, became a well known social democrat symbol representing resistance against Nazism, communism and monarchism during the parliamentary elections in November 1932, and was adopted by the SPD itself.  History  The Iron Front was formed on 16 December 1931 in the Weimar Republic by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) with the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (ADGB), the Reichsbanner and workers' sport clubs.Andreas Linhardt (2006). Die Technische Nothilfe in der Weimarer Republik. Dissertation: Braunschweig University of Technology. p. 667. . Retrieved 6 August 2011 . The Iron Front chiefly opposed the paramilitary organisations of the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Its initial purpose was to counter the right-wing Harzburg Front. The organization sought to engage the old Reichsbanner, the SPD youth organization and labor and liberal groups as a united front. The SPD rallied to the Iron Front, held mass demonstrations, fought Nazis and Communists in the streets, and armed themselves. This is more than the SPD leaders wanted, but SPD workers grew increasingly militant in their resistance against the authoritarian and totalitarian movements threatening the Weimar Republic. The Iron Front was regarded as an anti-communist and \\"social fascist terror organisation\\" by the KPD, who regarded the social democrats as their main adversary.Siegfried Lokatis: Der rote Faden.

In 1933, the Iron Front was banned by the Nazis.

It is in the Baltimore County Public Schools system. Background Currently located in Reisterstown near the intersection of Franklin Boulevard and Reisterstown Road, Franklin High has a long history. It was established on January 10, 1821 as the \\"Franklin Academy\\", a private school.Archives of Maryland Online The school went public in 1848, but wasn't completely under public control until 1874. Its name was then temporarily changed to the \\"Reisterstown High School\\". By 1896, the name of the school was changed back to reflect its earlier heritage, that of \\"Franklin High School\\". It is to be considered the oldest high school in the now Baltimore County Public Schools system, and one of the oldest in the Baltimore metropolitan area and the State. Before this time, in most of the county, prospective students, who passed the level of grammar (or elementary school) were able to travel into the central City of Baltimore if they wanted to continue on into public high schools. The more advanced and heavily populated City had been pushed by progressive and enlightened citizens and voters who went to the General Assembly of Maryland which authorized the Baltimore City government in 1825 to establish a system of free public education and schools. This was finally begun by the resolutions and ordinances of the Baltimore City Council and signed by the Mayor of Baltimore in 1829, which were the first in the State. Four grammar schools were initially established that year, two in each side of the city, with one for boys and one for girls. Within a few more years, additional grammar schools were created in various corners of town. Ten years later, in March 1839, the city council authorized the establishment of a new higher type of school, which had already been established in Boston and Philadelphia, and soon spread throughout their respective states of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, that of the \\"Public High School\\".. In October 1839, the \\"High School\\" for Baltimore opened with 46 boy students and one teacher/professor in a rented townhouse on Courtland Street (now St. Paul Street and Place) near East Saratoga Streets (now the location of \\"Preston Gardens\\" and nearby Mercy Hospital, now Mercy Medical Center) The High School moved several times in its first five years, and finally settled and went through three major sites/buildings in its now 175-year history. It changed names too, first becoming the \\"Male High School\\" when two additional public high schools for females were established in 1844, a few months apart in opposites sides of the city, known as Eastern and Western. In the 1850s, the Male High School became known as the \\"Central High School of Baltimore\\", until 1866, when the City Council authorized its final name of the \\"Baltimore City College\\" (B.C.C. or \\"City College\\" or \\"City\\"). For a number of decades in the late 19th century, the now B.C.C. served as both high school and an early sort of \\"junior\\" or \\"community college\\". Its curriculum, faculty and academic standards were much more advanced than most of today's high schools although only a small percentage of the teen-age population were able to go because of poverty or work conditions before the era of \\"compulsory education\\" school laws. Many students, however, from the county's rural farms and villages traveled by horseback, horse and buggy or cart, wagon, or the new \\"streetcar\\" system, with its rails reaching out all over the area by the early 20th century, when they were electrified and rode on rails. The math-science and engineering/technical high school was established a half-century later in 1883, as he \\"Baltimore Manual Training School\\", which was later changed a decade later to its current famous name, the \\"Baltimore Polytechnic Institute\\" (\\"Poly\\" or BPI). A \\"Colored\\" High School and Grammar School\\" was also finally established in 1883 after a long battle from the city's large Afro-American population which had gotten an earlier advance of some grammar public schools for their people after 1865, expanding the small, racially segregated school system, although at first with white teachers. Another decade of agitation was required before \\"colored\\" teachers were admitted to the BCPS. Later by 1925, the \\"Colored High School\\" was renamed \\"Frederick Douglass High School\\", then located in West Baltimore at several locations since the founding then settling in at Carey and Baker Streets. It was joined after 1937 by \\"Paul Laurence Dunbar Community High School\\" in East Baltimore and Orleans Street near North Central Avenue. Around 1925, also a \\"Colored\\" Vocational High School was started in several \\"hand-me- down\\" buildings until 1955 when a new, well-equipped structure was built at Presstman Street near North Bentalou Street, also in West Baltimore for the newly renamed \\"George Washington Carver Vocational-Technical High School\\". The few African-American students from Baltimore County, who could afford the carfare or somehow otherwise get to the city, had to attend the city's \\"Negro\\" high schools: Douglass, Dunbar or Carver all the way until the 1930s and 1940s until their own \\"George Washington Carver High School\\" in Towson was established for the county's blacks, generally then concentrated in East Towson or several other small villages scattered around the county. Baltimore County was established in 1659 and originally included most of northeast Maryland. Eventually over the next two centuries, several other counties had been cut off and separated, including: Harford, Cecil, Carroll, and Howard It had two county seats in the late 1600s and early 1700s known as \\"Old Baltimore\\" on the Bush River, near the Chesapeake Bay, (in modern Harford County). Then Joppa, in northeastern Baltimore County. The City which had been founded earlier in 1729 as \\"Baltimore Town\\", and incorporated as a city in 1797, (following the merger of three small villages: \\"Baltimore Town\\", \\"Jones' Town\\" and \\"Fell's Point\\"). Baltimore City had served as the third county seat with both city and county courts, sheriffs and single joint city/county jail, from 1767 to 1851, whereupon with the adoption that year of the Maryland Constitution of 1851, Baltimore City was separated and became an independent city with the same status as the other 23 counties of State of Maryland. The county seat was then chosen to be Towsontown after a referendum/election by the voters in 1853. Construction of a new courthouse, (the center part of the present County Courts complex) began in 1854 with also a county jail and an \\"almshouse\\" required by constitutional mandate. The original Franklin Academy private school building was built on Cockeysmill Road, where the Reisterstown branch of the Baltimore County Public Library is now located. In 1905, a new building was built for the public high school, leaving the old Academy building to be used for the elementary school, the now developing system of the Baltimore County Public Schools. An additional building was built in 1914, and another in 1930 to house the growing student population. Of these three buildings, only the 1914/1930 brick structure still stands on Main Street in Reisterstown, currently housing Franklin Middle School. Franklin High School was moved to a more modern building in 1960 about a mile down the road, where it remains to this day. Since 1960, two additions have been built, the most recent in 2000 to deal with the increasing severe overcrowding.History of Franklin High School . Franklin High School website.

The series centers on the demon hunter Dante and his efforts to thwart various demon invasions of Earth. Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series, new characters with unique skills are available. The series alludes to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Hideki Kamiya created Devil May Cry after a failed attempt to develop a Resident Evil; Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features, something which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by Hideaki Itsuno and writer Bingo Morihashi. Capcom announced a new game, DmC: Devil May Cry (developed by Ninja Theory and Capcom), during the 2010 Tokyo Game Show. A high-definition remastering of the three PlayStation 2 titles was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012, and in 2018 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The latest game is Devil May Cry 5, which was released on March 8, 2019. The series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to comic books, novelizations, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of action figures. Critical response to the gameplay combos has been positive, although the games' narrative was considered simple until the third installment. According to Eurogamer, another Capcom franchise, Strider, was a vital influence on the Devil May Cry franchise, and according to Retro Gamer, the over-the-top action of Devil May Cry draws from Strider, particularly in their inclusion of the \\"boss rush\\".Jones, Darran (24 Apr 2010). \\"The Making of... Strider\\". Retro Gamer (76). pp. 48-53. Game overview * Devil May Cry: Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly stylized combat; a high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings, while avoiding damage. Although the game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action. In later games, the system was modified; players had to vary their attacks to maintain their style rank. The Devil Trigger enables a player's character to assume a devilish form with additional powers (based on their current weapon), while the character's strength and speed increase and health is slowly restored. * Devil May Cry 2: Dante is generally the games' lead character, although most of the games offer other playable characters. The ability to perform combination attacks in mid- air and evasion and weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen. Dante attacks an enemy with the sword Alastor. The word \\"Cool!\\" assesses the player's performance in combat. * Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening: A selection of gameplay styles were added, allowing the player to focus on favorite techniques or weapons. Each of the four styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to cycle through a character's melee weaponry. The game was re-released as Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition with new skills for Dante and the ability to play as Vergil. * Devil May Cry 4: Nero's Devil Bringer arm gives players the ability to pull distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed. Nero is also armed with a sword which can be throttled up, allowing players to pre-charge it for extra damage on the next hit; with precise timing, it can be charged after each attack for extra damage and style. As Dante, players can switch fighting styles in mid-combat. An updated version titled Special Edition was rereleased featuring the ability to play as Vergil as well as Dante's two mates, Trish and Lady. *Devil May Cry HD Collection: A collection of the series' first three games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, ported by Pipeworks Software and Double Helix Games. It was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. * DmC: Devil May Cry: This title in the Devil May Cry series introduced changing environments to the gameplay. Players could reach hidden areas with the Ophion whip and grappling- hook, and the weapon had similar functions to the Devil Bringer in Devil May Cry 4. The environment often \\"attacked\\" Dante by changing its architecture and infrastructure to a more-hostile form, prompting fast-paced chase sequences and platforming scenarios.A Key Addition To DmC Devil May Cry Is Dynamic, Changing Environments.

Its rendition of Dante's appearance was criticized, and the developers promised to fix it when the game left the beta period for release in 2020. Plot The series begins two millennia before the first game with the demon Sparda, the Black Knight, defeating Demon World ruler Mundus. Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing a number of hellgates, sealing Temen-Ni- Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and the aid of a powerful priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and Vergil. The plot begins with Devil May Cry 3, a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil.Arkham: Is your name Dante? Son of Sparda? Dante: Where did you hear that? Arkham: From your brother. He sent this invitation to you. Please accept it. Dante: Invitation huh? (Devil May Cry 3) Capcom, 2005 A large tower erupts from the ground near the shop, and Dante interprets it as a challenge from Vergil.Dante: It's been nearly a year since we last met. Where does the time go? No doubt you've got some fun planned for me. Right Vergil? (Devil May Cry 3) Capcom, 2005 Dante is defeated in Temen-Ni-Gru by Vergil, who takes his locket and leaves with Arkham. Dante's dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is joined by Lady, who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge.Jester: It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you. But at the same time, I needed to guide you here and make sure you were kept alive. I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot! (Devil May Cry 3) Capcom, 2005Arkham: He plucks the threads that make us dance, finger and toe! We surrender in joy to the lowest of the foul and rank; we submerge through darkness, rancid filth. Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to Hell, in a slow, steady gait. Now, let the world resonate! Sloth! Gluttony! Greed! Envy! Lust! Wrath! And pride! A bell of chaos that tolls human desires! After two thousand long years, the once sealed gate to the demonic world will open! Destruction! Carnage and Despair! Let your instincts drive you! Entrap this world in fear! As its very name Temen- ni-gru strikes terror into the heart of mankind. Then I will become the ultimate ruler of this wasteland engulfed with pandemonium. The demonic power that Sparda once imprisoned ... will be mine! (Devil May Cry 3) Capcom, 2005 Dante and Vergil defeat him, and resume battling each other. The portal begins to close, and Vergil approaches it. Dante pleads with his brother not to go, but Vergil leaps into the Demon World before the portal closes. Vergil is tested and encounters Mundus, his mother's killer. When Lady returns to the human world, she coins the phrase \\"devil may cry\\"; Dante uses it for the shop.Lady: Are you crying? Dante: It's only the rain. Lady: The rain already stopped. Dante: Devils never cry. Lady: I see. Maybe somewhere out there even a devil may cry when he loses a loved one. Don't you think? Dante: Maybe. (Devil May Cry 3) Capcom, 2005Lady: Oh, speaking of a kind devil, he finally decided on a name for his shop. It took him quite a while to pick one. Want to know the name? Devil May Cry. (Devil May Cry 3) Capcom, 2005 Dante is confronted in Devil May Cry by Trish, who reveals that Mundus is planning to return and only a descendant of Sparda can defeat him.Trish: Yes, his powers were sealed by Sparda, he's attempting to take control of the human world again. He has been preparing to open the gate on ... Mallet Island. (Devil May Cry) Capcom, 2001 He explores Mallet Island (where Mundus is set to return), encountering demons which include Mundus' general:Griffon: Yours is definitely the power of Sparda ... No. Even more so. (Devil May Cry) Capcom, 2001 the undead Vergil, Nelo Angelo.Dante: This stinking hole was the last place that I thought I'd find anyone with some guts. (Devil May Cry) Capcom, 2001 As Dante approaches Mundus, he falls into a trap which reveals that Trish is the demon's agent; he saves her, however, because she resembles his mother. Trish saves Dante from Mundus, and Dante realizes his father's power.Dante: How much longer are you going to keep zapping? Come out and show yourself, Mundus! (Devil May Cry) Capcom, 2001 Dante defeats Mundus when Trish helps him return Mundus to the Demon World.Trish: Dante, use my power! Dante: Trish! Okay! (Devil May Cry) Capcom, 2001 Dante and Trish escape as the island collapses, and work together in the Devil Never Cry shop. In the Devil May Cry: The Animated Series anime, Trish is a demon hunter; Dante is the bodyguard of Patty, a young heiress who becomes obsessed with him. Patty's mother is descended from a sorcerer who sealed the power of Abigail, an ancient devil lord. Patty is targeted by Sid, a demon seeking Abigail's power. Lady and Trish fight demons summoned by Sid, and Dante kills him. Dante is invited by Lucia in Devil May Cry 2 to meet her mother, Matier. Dante learns that Arius is collecting artifacts (Arcana) to summon the demon lord Argosax.Matier: Son of Sparda ... we must ask this favor, of you ... You see, there's a man who's transformed our land into a demon's paradise; his name is Arius. And although he is the president, of an international public corporation ... he uses the demon power. Please, deal with Arius and his master for us. (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 Dante flips a coin, and decides to help.(After flipping a coin and noticing the result is heads.) Dante: ... Looks like it's your lucky day. (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 Lucia confronts Arius, who reveals that he created her.Arius: You are my creation. Lucia: Liar! Matier is my mother. Arius' secretary removes her mask, revealing the fact her face is identical to Lucia's. Arius: She merely found you when you were about to be disposed of, and then raised you as a soldier. Is that what you consider to be a mother? (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 Lucia gives Dante the last of the Arcana before facing Arius alone.Lucia: But ... actually ... I do not deserve this power ... Lucia: Bring this to Matier for me ... please ... I ... I've got something that I need to take care of ... (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 Dante encounters Matier, who asks him to take the Arcana to save Lucia from Arius.Matier: There is one more thing I need to ask of you, son of Sparda. My daughter went to face Arius all by herself ... Please, take these, and save Lucia. (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 Lucia attacks Arius, but he captures her. Dante arrives, trades the Arcana for Lucia, and attacks Arius (who escapes).Arius: You cannot win ... someone is holding you back... Lucia: Ugh, forget about me! Kill Arius! Dante: Don't worry. I've got you... (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 A stream of energy strikes the Ouroboros tower, and a portal to the demon world opens. Dante and Lucia argue about who will enter, and Dante determines that he will go.Lucia: But ...! Dante: Let's leave it to fate. Heads, I go; Tails, you go. He flips the coin and it lands as heads again Dante:See ya around. Lucia: Don't you want to hear the story about Sparda from ... Matier? Dante: I know ... He did the same thing ... Hold on to my coin, Lucia. (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 After Dante leaves, Arius returns to the human world and Lucia defeats him.Arius: You are not human! You are just a monster ... a monster that I created! Lucia: Dante told me ... Devils never cry! (Devil May Cry 2) Capcom, 2003 In Devil May Cry 4, Dante and Trish learn of foul play within the Order of the Sword and investigate while learning of its religious leader's scheme to conquer the world using Vergil's sword Yamato. Dante seemingly assassinates the Sanctus, only to face a young demon hunter acolyte named Nero who awakened his own demonic powers as a descendant of Sparda. Nero goes on a quest to capture Dante while gaining Yamato, only to learn the Order's dark secrets before being captured by Sanctus through his girlfriend. Dante manages to cripple Sanctus's plans before freeing Nero to finish the job, the two parting ways on good terms with Nero allowed to keep Yamato. In Devil May Cry 5, set several years after Devil May Cry 4, Nero runs a mobile branch of Dante's Devil May Cry business. He befriends Nico, a weapons artist and descendant of the gunsmith who crafted Dante's Ebony and Ivory handguns. Nero's Devil Bringer arm from Devil May Cry 4 is stolen; armed with a prosthetic Devil Breaker created by Nico, he leaves with Dante and the demon hunter V to face their \\"strongest foe yet\\". Although the series' timeline had placed Devil May Cry 4 before Devil May Cry 2, it was retconned with the release of Devil May Cry 5. DmC: Devil May Cry, developed by Ninja Theory, is not part of the timeline and takes place in an alternate universe from the main series. It moves away from the gothic look of the previous games to a more contemporary setting with some social commentary on mass media and culture Development The series is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri (pictured). After the completion of Resident Evil 2 in 1998, preliminary work on a PlayStation 2 installment of the Resident Evil series began by Team Little Devil under the direction of Hideki Kamiya. Early research and development included a trip to Spain to examine castles as a basis for the game's environments. Its prototype, however, was a radical departure from the Resident Evil formula and the survival horror genre. Kamiya rewrote the story and changed its premise, drawing from Italian poet Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy for Devil May Cry. Despite the success of the original game, its sequel was not created by Kamiya or Team Little Devils. Although an unidentified director was placed in charge of the project, Capcom was dissatisfied with their work and assigned Hideaki Itsuno \\"with only 4 to 5 months remaining in development\\" to steer the project back on course. Despite Itsuno's limited time on the project, he is the only person credited as director in the final version of the game. According to producer Tsuyoshi Tanaka, the design aim was to make Devil May Cry 2 bigger than its predecessor; Tanaka estimated that the game's environments were about nine times larger than the first. After Devil May Cry 2 mixed reception, Capcom decided to develop the next game like the more critically successful Devil May Cry. Gameplay elements, such as environment size and battle engine, were reconsidered. In the original game, Vergil was killed by demons early and his soul was controlled by Mundus; Bingo Morihashi wanted to create an alternate universe in which Vergil was alive. However, Kamiya gave Morihashi the freedom to rework Vergil's backstory and make him a living teenager for Devil May Cry 3. As a result, the game was designed as a prequel to the series, set several years before the events of the first game. Development of Devil May Cry 4 began shortly after its predecessor's success. The development team had 80 members. A new protagonist was discussed many times at Capcom, but was not approved until producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi said that Dante had to be in the game. Kobashi said before the game's release that they wanted to make Dante seem significantly more powerful than Nero, to create an obvious difference between the strength of a \\"veteran\\" compared to a \\"rookie\\". Writer Morihashi collaborated with film director Yuji Shimomura, who worked on the earlier games. Morihashi left Capcom at one point, but returned at Itsuno's request. It took him a year to finish writing the game; he had difficulty with the characterization of Nero, the new protagonist. Dante returned as a supporting character. Although the fourth game was a commercial and critical success, the staff considered rebooting the series because other game series had better sales. They chose Ninja Theory, impressed with their work on Heavenly Sword (which the staff thought would work with a Devil May Cry game). However, in 2013 Itsuno expressed interest in developing a fifth installment. It was originally thought that Itsuno intended for the series to go on hiatus or end if Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition was not a commercial success, but he said in a GameSpot interview that the series' future did not depend on Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition's sales. He alleviated fears that DmC: Devil May Cry's sales would kill the series, confirming that Capcom was satisfied with them. In mid-January 2016, Itsuno tweeted that he had begun work on a new project. Reuben Langdon and Johnny Yong Bosch, who had done voice acting and motion capture for Dante and Nero in Devil May Cry 4, took pictures of themselves in motion-capture gear in March 2016; this led to speculation that a new Devil May Cry game was in development. According to Capcom Vancouver, \\"It's not a game that [they] announced that [they are] working on at [their] studio\\". On May 17, 2018, the domain name \\"DevilMayCry5.com\\" was registered under Capcom's Onamae domain register. Devil May Cry 5, featuring the return of Dante and Nero, was confirmed at E3 2018 for release the following year.E3 2018: Devil May Cry 5 Confirmed At Xbox One Press Conference, GameSpot Most of the team had worked on the recently released Resident Evil 7, and were experienced with the game engine; Itsuno was influenced by his work in Monster Hunter: World to provide content appealing to new gamers, but also felt that making the game challenging would appeal to long-time fans. Other members of the staff had worked on the reboot game DmC: Devil May Cry, but the Osaka team was more willing to make a sequel to the fourth installment of the main series. The team listened to fan opinion about previous games, to ensure that the new game appealed to them; an \\"auto\\" mode facilitated combos. Itsuno was moved to tears by a film in which three robots combined into a giant robot to overcome their foe, and wanted to create similar moments. He wanted to convey the style of a Hollywood movie such as Marvel's Avengers series. Kamiya, currently working at PlatinumGames, was interested in making a remake of the first installment and a crossover game with Dante and Bayonetta. Other media=Light novels The series has a number of print adaptations. Two Devil May Cry light novels, written by Shinya Goikeda and illustrated by Shirow Miwa, were published in Japan in 2002 and translated and published in the United States in 2006. The first, Devil May Cry Volume 1, was published in Japan in conjunction with the release of the first game and explores Dante in an adventure set before the events of the game. The second, entitled Devil May Cry Volume 2 in the US, was published in Japan to coincide with the release of the second game and is set after the events of the first game. Tokyopop published the books in the United States in June and November 2006, respectively. Bingo Morihashi wrote a Devil May Cry 4 novel entitled Devil May Cry 4 Deadly Fortune. The two-volume novel, published in Japan in 2009, has a number of scenes which were not included in the original game due to time constraints. A prequel novel by Morihashi titled Before the Nightmare, set before Devil May Cry 5 and leading to the beginning of the game, was published on March 1, 2019.  Comics and manga Three issues of a comic adaptation of the first game were published by the Canadian Dreamwave Productions in 2004, but the series was left unfinished when the company went bankrupt the following year. On July 25, 2008, WildStorm (a DC Comics imprint) and Capcom announced that they would collaborate on a Devil May Cry comic-book series. Details about the series were planned to be announced at a later date, but no new information has been provided. Two volumes of a planned three-part Devil May Cry 3 manga series have been published in Japan and the United States. Set a year before the events of Devil May Cry 3, the manga describes how the characters come to be where they are at the beginning of the game. On March 7, 2019, Capcom announced that a tie-in manga entitled Devil May Cry 5 Visions of V would be serialized on the Japanese manga-hosting site Line Manga (LINE „Éû„É≥„Ç¨). The manga's prologue was published before the serialization began. Illustrated by Tomio Ogata, the manga (only available in Japan) would update every other Sunday beginning on April 27. Animation An anime series, Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, premiered on Japan's Wowow TV network on June 12, 2007. The 12-episode series, produced by Madhouse, was directed by Shin Itagaki. Bingo Morihashi, a writer of the third and fourth games, was one of its writers. In November 2018, Adi Shankar announced that he had acquired the rights to produce a Devil May Cry animated series. Shankar, who has been completing a similar animated series for Konami's Castlevania franchise, said that he considered both series part of a shared \\"Bootleg Multiverse\\". Film On February 28, 2011, Screen Gems (which made Resident Evil into a film series) had purchased feature-film rights to the Devil May Cry series. Kyle Ward was hired to write the screenplay for the film (based on DmC: Devil May Cry), which would be Dante's origin story. No news have been emerging about the project's status. Plays Capcom produced Sengoku Basara vs. Devil May Cry a staged amalgam of the Devil May Cry and Sengoku Basara series, in August 2015. In the play, Dante, Lady, Trish, and Vergil encounter mysterious historical ruins while chasing a devil and are sent back in time to Japan's Warring States period; there, they meet Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura and other characters from the Sengoku Basara franchise. The play ran at the AiiA 2.5 Theater in Tokyo for 18 performances. Masanari Ujigawa wrote and directed the play, and Hideaki Itsuno and Izaki Matsuno collaborated on the scenery. Kazushi Miyakoda and Tetsuya Yamaura were the producers, supervised by Hiroyuki Kobayashi and Makoto Yamamoto. Devil May Cry: The Live Hacker, a musical, ran for 13 performances in March 2019 at Zepp DiverCity in Tokyo. Jun Yoriko wrote and directed the musical and its video, and a DVD was released in late August of that year. In other games Devil May Cry characters appear in the PlayStation versions of the Viewtiful Joe games, another Capcom series created by Hideki Kamiya; Dante is a playable character in the PlayStation 2 port of the first Viewtiful Joe. The PSP version of Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble also includes Dante and costumes based on Vergil, Trish, Sparda, Marionette, and Plasma. In a deal between Capcom and Atlus, Megami Tensei character designer Kazuma Kaneko created Dante and Vergil's demonic forms in Devil May Cry 3. In return, Atlus included Dante in his Devil May Cry 2 costume as a character in an enhanced release of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne (Maniax in Japan). The English localization of Nocturne was based on the game's Maniax edition. Dante and Trish are playable characters in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and Vergil, Dante and Trish are playable characters in its Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 update. Dante and Vergil retain their Kazuma Kaneko-designed Devil Trigger forms, since they are based on the third game of the Devil May Cry series. The DmC: Devil May Cry version of Dante is a playable character in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, and he is a playable character in Project X Zone for the Nintendo 3DS as half of a pair with Darkstalkers Demitri Maximoff; Lady is a separate character. Dante returns in its sequel, Project X Zone 2, with Vergil; Vergil's future self, Nelo Angelo, is a rival character. Reception By December 31, 2019, the Devil May Cry series had sold 21 million units worldwide;CAPCOM  Game Series Sales each installment was a Capcom Platinum Title, selling over a million units. As of December 2019, Devil May Cry 5 had sold 3.1 million copies. The series has received generally positive reviews. In 2010, IGN ranked Devil May Cry number 42 and Devil May Cry 3 number 18 on its \\"Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games\\" list. The series' gameplay has been praised as innovative. Devil May Cry has been cited as beginning a subgenre of \\"extreme combat\\" action games, which focus on powerful heroes fighting hordes of foes with stylized action. It has been described as the first game that \\"successfully captured the twitch-based, relentlessly free-flowing gameplay style of so many classic 2D action games\\". The series is the standard against which other 3D hack and slash action games are measured, with comparisons in reviews of games such as God of War, Chaos Legion, and Blood Will Tell. Devil May Cry 5 has three protagonists with distinctive abilities, increasing the number of moves available. According to Hiroyuki Kobayashi, the team's work on Devil May Cry 4 influenced Capcom's Dragon's Dogma. Response to the series' narrative has been mixed, despite Dante's increased popularity. The series' popularity led to a line of Devil May Cry action figures produced by Toycom, and Kaiyodo produced a Devil May Cry 2 and Devil May Cry 3 Dante action figure. According to a gamecritics.com reviewer, the story was overly short and the characters underdeveloped. Dante's cockiness was noted as largely absent from Devil May Cry 2. Devil May Cry 3 and its relationships among the cast in the narrative were found to be superior to Kamiya's original version. Dante's dynamic with Nero in the following game was praised, with critics saying that neither overshadowed the other. According to GameCored, many fans were eager to play as Vergil again in Devil May Cry 5 and were disappointed that he was not a playable character. HobbyConsolas hacked into the game to find code which mentioned the character's name, but was unable to determine if Vergil would be playable as downloadable content. Devil May Cry 5s handling of its characters and their connections was well received.

He was born January 1, 1837, in Dungannon, Ireland (one source, Large, says \\"Tullyvally, Ireland\\"), to a Protestant (Anglican) family. In 1862, at the age of twenty-five, he sailed to Canada with the Anglican Church Missionary Society to work as a lay assistant to the Anglican lay missionary William Duncan at the Tsimshian community of Metlakatla, B.C.  Missionary Work  Shortly after his arrival at Metlakatla Robert Cunningham was assigned to assist the missionary R. Arthur Doolan, himself newly arrived from England, in founding a new mission among the Nisga'a. Together with a Tsimshian interpreter named Robert Dundas they opened a mission among the villages on the lower Nass River in July 1864. When it soon came to light that Cunningham had fathered a child with a young Tsimshian student of Duncan's named Elizabeth Ryan Doolan married the couple and Cunningham's formal relationship with the Church Missionary Society was terminated.  Trader  Cunningham began working at the Hudson's Bay Company's Fort Simpson, a trading fort later known as Port Simpson and Lax Kw'alaams. He worked alongside Charles F. Morison, who eventually married Elizabeth's niece Odille Quintal (later Morison), the Tsimshian linguist. Cunningham eventually rose to the position of chief trader. In 1870 he left the HBC and Port Simpson. Versions differ as to the circumstances of this: discontent over his salary or a trumped-up charge of rum-running imposed by Duncan (who was also the local justice of the peace), or both. Cunningham then began an entrepreneurial relationship with one Thomas Hankin (later father to the Tlingit interpreter and teacher Constance Cox. In 1871, with the onset of the Omineca Gold Rush, Cunningham and Hankin became traders at Hazelton, in Gitxsan territory, and eventually founded a depot at Woodcock's Landing downriver at the Skeena River estuary, at what later became the site of Inverness cannery. In search of a better location, the two staked a claim for a plot of land at a site Tsimshians called Spaksuut (fall camping-place), on the territory of the Gitzax≈Çaa≈Ç Tsimshians at the confluence of the Skeena and Ecstall rivers. In 1872 a store was built there, and the site gradually acquired a more or less permanent presence of Kitselas and Kitsumkalum Tsimshians from upriver. By the 1890s Port Essington, as Spaksuut came to be known, was a small town, and soon it became the largest settlement in the region and its economic hub. Cunningham bought out Hankin and established salmon packing as the community's main industry. The Cunningham Cannery produced \\"Diamond A\\" brand canned salmon. Though other canneries operated in the town, Port Essington was largely considered to be \\"Cunningham's town.\\" Several members of Cunningham's family in Ireland eventually moved to Port Essington, as did Charles and Odille Morison. In 1888, Cunningham's wife Elizabeth was drowned with several others when their canoe capsized off Port Lambert near Port Essington. Of their five children, only two, George and John, survived early childhood, and John was killed at age seventeen when a trading schooner was wrecked near the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 1893 Cunningham married again, to Flora Bicknell, formerly of Coventry, in England. They had two children, Hazel and Harold. A third, Edith, was born shortly after Robert's death, in April 1905, in Victoria, B.C., at the age of sixty-nine. He is buried in Metlakatla.

Completed in 1874, it was the city's first federal building. It housed the federal courts, excise offices and post office until 1933. From 1936 to 1976, it was used by the Tennessee Valley Authority for offices. Expanded in 2004, the building is currently home to the East Tennessee History Center, which includes the Lawson McGhee Library's Calvin M. McClung Historical Collection, the Knox County Archives, and the East Tennessee Historical Society's headquarters and museum. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance. Design The Old Customs House is a three-story Italianate style building sheathed in East Tennessee marble. The smooth exterior walls contrast with rusticated quoins at the building's corners.Ellen Beasley, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Old Post Office Building, 1 November 1972. The former courtroom on the third floor is notable for its neoclassical detailing. Much of the original interior has been altered. History The Customs House is situated on what was originally Lot 11 of James White's 1795 extension of Knoxville.Samuel G. Heiskell, Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History (Nashville: Ambrose Printing Company, 1918), p. 60. An 1871 map of Knoxville shows the property as an open grove surrounded by a few small houses.A. Ruger, \\"Bird's Eye View of the City of Knoxville, Knox County, Tennessee,\\" 1871. The Old Customs House, as it appeared in 1886 Throughout the 1850s, Congress was petitioned by cities across the country to provide courtrooms and post offices. Congress was reluctant to provide funding for buildings that only contained judicial and postal functions, so the title \\"Customs House\\" was typically used instead of \\"courthouse\\" or \\"post office.\\" Congress was viewed as more agreeable to providing construction funding if excise taxes collected from foreign imports were linked to projects, since taxes generated revenue. Congress originally appropriated funding for Knoxville's Customs House in 1856, and reappropriated the funding in 1869.United States Treasury Department, A History of Public Buildings Under the Control of the Treasury Department (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1901), p. 553. Construction of the original portion of the Customs House (at the corner of Clinch and Market), designed by U.S. government chief architect Alfred B. Mullett (1834‚Äì1890), began in 1871 and was completed in 1874. The first floor was used as a post office, while the second and third floors were used for the federal court and as office space for various federal officials, namely postal inspectors, pension agents, court officials, and internal-revenue officers. As Knoxville's population quadrupled in the late 19th century, the increased postal activity left the Customs House critically overcrowded,L.M. Shaw, H.C. Payne, P.C. Knox, Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, Postmaster-General, and Attorney-General Reporting in Regard to the Government Building at Knoxville, Tenn., 4 December 1902. Retrieved: 17 October 2011. and thus the building was enlarged in 1910. A 1913 government document describes the building as \\"clean and well kept,\\" with a \\"large and roomy\\" workroom for postal employees. The document stated that the building had its own steam plant for heating, and used electricity provided by the Knoxville Railway & Light Company.Presidential Commission on Economy and Efficiency, United States Post Office and Courthouse, Knoxville, Tenn., 8 January 1913, p. 888. Retrieved: 17 October 2011. Knoxville's continued growth rendered the Customs House insufficient for the city's postal needs, and a new post office was built on Main Street in 1934.Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 135, 170. Ownership of the Customs House was transferred to the newly created Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for use as office space. Along with the Customs House, TVA maintained offices in the nearby Arnstein Building and in the Daylight Building on Union Avenue. Following the completion of the TVA Towers in 1976, ownership of the Customs House was transferred to Knox County for use by the Lawson McGhee Library's Calvin M. McClung Historical Collection, and the Knox County Archives. In the 1980s, the East Tennessee Historical Society (ETHS), which had been using the McClung Collection's office equipment and staff, moved into the Customs House, and set up the East Tennessee Historical Center. The Society initially used the second floor of the Customs House, but moved to the first floor in 1992.W.

Beautiful but thoughtless Hetty lives in the fictional community of Hayslope ‚Äî a rural, pastoral and close-knit community in 1799. Her home is on Mr. Martin Poyser's dairy farm as she is his niece. Because she is an extremely pretty girl, she is admired by Mr. Craig and Adam Bede as well as Captain Arthur Donnithorne. Aside from her great physical beauty, George Eliot takes care to make it clear that she does not have many attractive personal qualities. She is spoiled, cold, insensitive, indifferent to other people's problems, and almost comically vain and selfish. Hetty is a cousin by marriage of Dinah Morris, a fervent Methodist lay preacher. In contrast to Hetty, Dinah is depicted as completely pure, generous, unselfish, modest, and unfailingly compassionate. The novel revolves around a love triangle between vain and pleasure-loving Hetty Sorrel, Captain Arthur Donnithorne, the young squire who seduces her, Adam Bede, her unacknowledged lover, and Dinah Morris. Adam is in love with Hetty. Though she is only a milkmaid, Hetty secretly longs for the luxurious life of an upper class lady. She is attracted to Captain Donnithorne and soon falls in love with him. When Adam interrupts a tryst between them, Adam and Arthur fight. Arthur leaves Hayslop to return to his militia. Broken- hearted, she agrees to marry Adam but shortly before their marriage, discovers she is pregnant, and having second thoughts, leaves in search of Arthur. She cannot find Arthur, and unwilling to return to the village and shame her family, she delivers her baby anonymously. She kills the child by abandoning it in a field, where it dies of exposure. Hetty is caught and tried for child murder. She is found guilty and sentenced to hang. When Arthur Donnithorne, on leave from the militia for his grandfather's funeral, hears of her impending execution, he races to the court and has the sentence commuted to transportation. According to The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1967), :\\"the plot [of Adam Bede] is founded on a story told to George Eliot by her aunt Elizabeth Evans, a Methodist preacher, and the original of Dinah Morris of the novel, of a confession of child-murder, made to her by a girl in prison.\\" References * The Oxford Companion to English Literature (1967) Category:George Eliot characters ","title":"Hetty Sorrel"},{"id":"10146098","text":"The painted comber (Serranus scriba) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a sea bass from the subfamily Serraninae, classified as part of the family Serranidae which includes the groupers and anthias. It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea. Confusingly, a synonym of this species is Perca marina, but that name (as Sebastes marinus) has incorrectly been used for a separate species, the rose fish. Description The painted comber has a laterally compressed, elongate body with a pointed snout. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 4-16 soft rays and the anal fin has 3 spines and 7-8 soft rays. The caudal fin is truncate. It has a very large mouth for its size, which has many sharp teeth, and is protractile. The overall colour may be grey, purplish or reddish with 5-7 dark brown bars on the flanks> The head is marked with many narrow, wavy blue lines and red blotches. The dorsal, anal and caudal fins are marked with red dots. There is a diffuse, purplish-blue blotch in the middle of the body. The pelvic and pectoral fins are normally uniform pale yellow. The maximum recorded fish measurement is , although is more typical> Distribution The painted comber is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean where its core range extends from the Straits of Gibraltar to Senegal, including the Canary Islands but it occurs as far north as the Bay of Biscay. Its range extends into the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Habitat and biology The painted comber occurs over rocky bottom and among beds of Posidonia at depths of . It normally speneds the day sheltering in rocky caves and is normally either solitary or found in small groups. It emerges at dusk to hunt. It is a carnivorous species which is a territorial ambush hunter and has a diet made up of cephalopods, bivalves, crustaceans, fishes, and worms. It is often used to indicate sites occupied by octopuses as it waits at the entrance scavenging the octopus's discarded parts of shellfish. The spawning season runs from late spring to early summer with the eggs being laid under stones near the shore. It is a synchronous hermaphrodite, i.e. each individual has both male and female gonads and may be capable of self-fertilisation. They have a maximum life expectancy of 16 years. Drawing of a \\"Lettered Serramus\\" from The natural history of fishes of the perch family - The Naturalist's Library, 1835  Parasites  The painted comber, like most fishes, is host to a variety ofinternal and external parasites and these include the copepods Lernanthropus scribae, Caligus scribae and Anchistrotos laqueus; an isopod Gnathia sp.; a monogean Protolamellodiscus serranelli; and two species of digeneans Helicometra fasciata and Lecithochirium musculus. Taxonomy The painted comber was first formally described by Linnaeus in the 10th Edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758 as Perca scriba. Human use The painted comber is landed by artisanal fisheries using hook and line and trawls. It is said to have palatable flesh and can be prepared using a variety of cooking methods.

The brigade was established to act swiftly against Confederate forces operating near the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet and operated in coordination with the Mississippi River Squadron during the Union brown-water navy battle against the Confederate River Defense Fleet and land based forces. The brigade was independent of the Union Army and Navy and reported directly to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. Despite the name, it was never part of the United States Marine Corps. Organization Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet was commander of the Mississippi Marine Brigade Brigadier General Alfred W. Ellet was the commanding officer of the United States Ram Fleet. The ram fleet had proven themselves a useful addition to the Mississippi River Squadron through their actions at the First Battle of Memphis and on the Yazoo River. However, the ram fleet was outside the Union Navy and Army command and reported directly to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton. Although they coordinated their activities with the Mississippi River Squadron led by Charles H. Davis, the reporting structure was problematic for Union Navy leaders. The brigade was never incorporated into the Union Navy, however, when David Dixon Porter took over command of the Mississippi River Squadron, he demanded and received full authority over the ram fleet. Porter needed an amphibious force to suppress enemy fire from the river shores that threatened his fleet. On November 1, 1862, Ellet was charged with creating and commanding the Mississippi Marine Brigade. The unit consisted of artillery, cavalry and infantry with the ram fleet used for transportation. The brigade was not able to recruit from existing Army or Navy units and instead recruited convalescing soldiers from hospitals who wished to return to service. Ellet promised recruits bonuses, the opportunity to serve aboard clean vessels with good food and the potential for fame. On November 5, Ellet's nephew, Charles Rivers Ellet was promoted to the rank of colonel and became the third member of the Ellet family to lead the ram fleet. Ellet was only 19 years old, which made him one of the youngest colonels in the Union Army. Another nephew, John A. Ellet also served as Lieutenant Colonel in the brigade. Union Navy Memorial at Vicksburg The unit consisted of about 350 officers and men, including boat crews which used the nine steam powered rams of the United States Ram Fleet. Other vessels were added to the ram fleet including the tugs Alf Cutting, Bell Darlington and Cleveland; the hospital ship Woodford and the transports Autocrat, Baltic and Diana. Vicksburg Campaign On December 12, 1862, the Queen of the West was one of the ships that accompanied the USS Cairo up the Yazoo River. The Cairo was struck by a 'torpedo' or naval mine and began to sink rapidly. The Queen of the West was able to rescue part of the crew from the Cairo before it sank. In February 1863, the Queen of the West was run past the batteries of Vicksburg, Mississippi to support Admiral David Farragut south of the city. The Queen of the West severely damaged the CSS Vicksburg and captured four transport ships supplying Confederate forces. The Queen of the West also conducted activities on the Atchafalaya River, destroying Confederate supplies and burning three plantations. She was captured by Confederate forces on the Red River near Fort DeRussy and entered into Confederate service as the CSS Queen of the West. The USS Switzerland and USS Lancaster running past the batteries at Vicksburg On March 26, the ram ships Switzerland and USS Lancaster were run past the batteries at Vicksburg to support Admiral Farragut. Charles Rivers Ellet commanded the Switzerland and his cousin, John A. Ellet, commanded the Lancaster. Both ships received heavy fire from the batteries and the Lancaster was run aground and sunk to avoid capture by the Confederate forces. The Switzerland was damaged but was repaired and continued duty south of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River. On June 14, the unit joined Brigadier General Joseph A. Mower in the Battle of Richmond, Louisiana and skirmished with the Confederates, losing 3 wounded. On June 19, Brigadier General Ellett ordered construction of a casemate on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River opposite Vicksburg. The fortification was completed in four days and was protected with a thickness of railroad iron. A 20-pounder Parrott rifle was placed within and fired on the city the morning of June 23. The Confederates responded firing 17 rounds from 5 different guns. The fort was further strengthened by adding another thickness of railroad iron. Fire from the Parrott gun in the fort was maintained until the end of the siege with a total of 98 rounds being expended. The fort was repeatedly struck but without material damage and without loss of life. The brigade also placed a brass Dahlgren gun in the casemate near the 20-pounder Parrott. Considerable damage to the Confederates was accomplished especially by stopping work at the foundry and machine shop. On June 25-30, a detachment of the brigade on the steamer John Rains, formed a part of an expedition to Greenville, Mississippi under the command of Lt. Col. Samuel J. Nasmith of the 25th Wisconsin Infantry. On June 30, the brigade saw action at the Goodrich's Landing. Two African-American Union regiments, the 1st Arkansas and the 10th Louisiana had come under attack from Confederate forces. The brigade arrived and pushed back the Confederate forces, suffering two casualties and one death. Transfer to Army jurisdiction A ruling of the Judge-Advocate General, dated 11 Jun 1863, seems to make the brigade a \\"special contingent of the army and not the navy,\\" but as late as 23 July 1863, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant wrote: \\"They (the officers and men of the Marine Brigade) are not subject to my orders.\\" By order of the Secretary of War the army assumed full jurisdiction over the brigade in October 1863. The brigade was disestablished in August 1864, and its surviving ships were transferred to other duties. Notable members *Henry N.

He may have been a Gallo-Roman martyr, but his legend was confused with that of other saints, such as Justin of Paris.\\"Justin of Beauvais\\", Saint of the Day, St. Patrick's Catholic Church History Tradition states that he was a child of nine who was denounced as a Christian while on a trip with his father to Amiens to ransom or rescue an imprisoned relative during the persecutions of Diocletian. He was executed for confessing that he was a Christian and for refusing to give away the hiding place of his father and uncle. After he was beheaded, Justus' body then picked up the severed head and continued to speak. Justus is thus one of the legendary cephalophores, the saintly \\"head-carriers\\" who miraculously continued to speak or move despite being decapitated. This legend was elaborated in subsequent centuries, and stated that the headless boy managed to convert pagan onlookers. This miraculous act is said to have happened in a spot between Beauvais and Senlis now named after him: Saint-Just-en-Chauss√©e. Veneration Veneration for Justus was widespread in France, Belgium, and Switzerland\\"Justus of Beauvais\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Saints ‚Äìwhere places named Saint-Just refer to him- and his cult spread to England as well. Winchester claimed some of his relics from the 10th century. In England the Annales monasterii de Wintonia reports that in 924 Athelstan donated to the treasury of Winchester the head of this martyr. It is possible that this may not have been the entire head but just a fragment of it, according to one scholar. In the first half of the 11th century, the diocese of Chur in Switzerland received his relics as well. Additionally, the abbey of Malm√©dy in Belgium asserted that at the beginning of 10th century its monk had acquired -at a good price- the body of Justus. Saint-Riquier also claimed his body. Zutphen in the Netherlands also claimed some of his relics since at least the 14th century. Franciscans brought an additional relic of Justus to Zutphen around 1450 when they established themselves there. A confraternity dedicated to Ewald and Justus was established in 1454. His feast is celebrated on October 11 there.

Moore's songs were praised by critics and admired by a diverse range of peers including Keith Richards, Jimmy Webb, James Taylor and Michael McDonald. Career=Early bands A self-taught musician, Moore grew up in Philadelphia, where he went to art school and played his early songs at local coffee houses. His rock career began with DC & the Senators opening arena rock concerts in Philadelphia. He played drums with Woody's Truck Stop, the first band to feature Todd Rundgren. He and a friend started the Muffins, the first group to record and perform Tim Moore pop songs. The Muffins had minor success on RCA Records with the single \\"Subway Traveler\\". During its year of existence, the band did one week residencies at the Trauma, a psychedelic club in Philadelphia, with acts like the Velvet Underground. After the Muffins disbanded, Frank Zappa heard Moore play solo and considered his songs harmonically advanced for the time. Zappa brought Moore to New York with the intention of signing him to his label, Bizarre Records. Moore declined the offer when Zappa couldn't schedule time to produce the album himself. Moore returned to Philadelphia and worked as a staff writer and studio musician on sessions with Thom Bell, Gamble and Huff, and other producers of Philadelphia soul. He lived next door to singer Daryl Hall in downtown Philadelphia, where they worked together as staff writers for a production company. Moore and Hall co-founded a new band, Gulliver, who released one album for Elektra Records. Solo career After the breakup of Gulliver, Moore sought a more personal approach to his music. He moved to Woodstock, New York, the residence of Bob Dylan, The Band, and Van Morrison. He signed with Dunhill Records, which issued his first single, \\"A Fool Like You,\\" on which Donald Fagen of Steely Dan sang backup. In return, Moore sang backup on the first Steely Dan single, \\"Dallas\\". Moore's self titled debut solo album came in 1974 as the first release by a label called A Small Record Company. It was distributed by Paramount and its parent company Famous Music Corp. It was produced by Nick Jameson, who recognized Moore's multi- instrumental talents and encouraged him to assemble his own tracks. Moore layered guitar, keyboard, and bass parts over drum tracks by Bernard Purdie, and Russ Kunkel. The debut single \\"Second Avenue\\" charted in the US and UK. But as it was headed up the US charts Famous Music closed its record operations. When record label chiefs Clive Davis and David Geffen heard that Moore was a free agent, a bidding war ensued. Moore chose to sign with Geffen's Asylum Records. Meanwhile Art Garfunkel released a new version of Second Avenue. Garfunkel's version peaked at No. 34 on the Billboard magazine Hot 100 chart and number six Adult Contemporary while Moore's original peaked at No. 58 after re-release. During 1975 Moore released the album Behind the Eyes. This featured what remains his best-known song, \\"Rock and Roll Love Letter\\". The song was a hit when re-recorded by the Bay City Rollers a year later. Moore's guitar playing on this song caught the attention of Keith Richards, guitarist for the Rolling Stones. They became friends and Moore spent two weeks in rehearsals with the Rolling Stones and Peter Tosh at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock. Moore's third album, White Shadows, was recorded in Los Angeles with more polished production and a group of seasoned musicians, including Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers, Jeff Porcaro of Toto, Timothy B. Schmit of the Eagles, and Bill Payne of Little Feat. The album was followed by High Contrast, produced by Ken Scott, who had worked with The Beatles, David Bowie, Devo and Supertramp. Singers continued to mine his new releases for songs but Moore's records received limited attention in the United States. In 1986 Moore released his fifth album, Flash Forward. He spent 75 days touring Brazil after \\"Yes,\\" a ballad from that album, rocketed to No.1 and stayed there for ten weeks. Recent activity As of 2019, Moore continues to write songs and plans new recording projects and live dates through 2020. He is a polymath and self-directed learner who focuses on social psychology, human behavior and digital-human interfaces. Two major non-fiction books have been in production for over a decade. A memoir is also taking shape. His fine art work will be published as an edition of prints in late 2019. In 2016, was the music director for an all-star tribute to Lou Reed for the 50th anniversary of Max's Kansas City.

Harris continued his father's successful art dealing business, and was an essentially amateur artist himself. Harris had an important collection of Spanish prints, especially those of Goya, which was mostly acquired by the British Museum after his death. In fact, Harris, while still alive, had placed his collection on indefinite loan in the British MuseumBritish Museum,The graphic work of Goya : an exhibition of etchings and lithographs held in the Department of Prints and Drawings of the British Museum, 12th December 1963 to 29th February 1964 (1963), p. 1.

Early life Liversidge was born at Turnham Green, Chiswick, England, the son of John Liversidge of Bexley and his wife Caroline Sophia, n√©e Jarratt. Liversidge was educated at a private school and by private tutors in science, and in 1866 went to the Royal College of Chemistry and Royal School of Mines. In 1867 Liversidge won a Royal exhibition and medals in chemistry, mineralogy and metallurgy. Liversidge became an associate of the School of Mines and in 1870 was awarded an open scholarship in science at Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1870 Liversidge became a demonstrator of chemistry at the university laboratory. Career in Australia In 1872 Liversidge accepted the appointment of 'Reader in Geology and Assistant in the Laboratory' at the University of Sydney and began his duties there early in 1873. Liversidge became professor of geology and mineralogy in 1874, and in 1876 he published The Minerals of New South Wales, being a reprint of a paper read at the Royal Society of New South Wales in December 1874. A second and enlarged edition appeared in 1882 and a third edition in 1888. Edward Rennie was a pupil and the two men were in contact until Liversidge's death. In 1878 he visited the leading museums, universities and technical colleges of Europe, and by 1879 he had persuaded the senate to open a faculty of science. In 1880 his Report upon certain Museums for Technology, Science and Art, was published at Sydney. In this same year, Liversidge visited Europe as a trustee of the Australian Museum and his report helped to establish the Industrial, Technological and Sanitary Museum which formed the basis of the present Powerhouse Museum's collection.MacLeod, Roy (Sydney: , 2009). In 1881 the title of his chair was altered to chemistry and mineralogy, and in 1891 to chemistry only. Liversidge was dean of the faculty of science from its foundation in 1882 until 1904; he also founded the school of mines at the University in 1892. Liversidge was deeply involved in the Royal Society of New South Wales; he was honorary secretary from 1874 to 1884 and 1886‚Äì88, was its president in 1885, 1889 and 1900, and was for many years editor of the Society's Journal and Proceedings. In 1888 Liversidge, after much preliminary work, founded the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, was its honorary secretary from 1888 to 1909 and president in 1898. Liversidge was chairman of the original board of the Sydney technical museum, was a trustee of the Australian Museum at Sydney, and he founded the Sydney section of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1902. Liversidge resigned his professorship at Sydney in December 1907 and became emeritus professor. In 1909 Liversidge returned to England and became vice-president of the Society of Chemical Industry, 1909‚Äì12, and vice- president of the Chemical Society 1910‚Äì13. Liversidge then lived in retirement at Fieldhouse, Kingston Hill and died on 26 September 1927 from a heart attack. He was unmarried. Legacy The 2014 Liversidge Award medal In addition to the works mentioned above, Liversidge published for the use of students Tables for Qualitative Chemical Analysis (second edition 1903). He also wrote over 100 papers on chemistry and mineralogy for scientific journals, many of which were issued as pamphlets, and during his stay in Australia he was an untiring worker in the cause of science. Joseph Maiden, in his \\"History of the Royal Society of New South Wales\\", said of Liversidge that \\"he practically re-founded the Society, organized its activities on proper lines, and made it the power for good it is to-day\\". Liversidge laid the foundations of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, was an honorary secretary for 21 years, and retained his interest in the association after his retirement to England. Liversidge was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1882, was honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was given the honorary degree of LL.D. by Glasgow university. Under his will a sum of ¬£2500 was left to the University of Sydney for scholarships and a research lectureship in chemistry. The Faraday Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry issues a Liversidge Award, named in his honour.

It is led by the supervillain Thaal Sinestro. Publication history The Sinestro Corps first appears in Green Lantern vol. 4 #10 and was created by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver. Fictional history=Before the Corps The Parallax entity is a space parasite that is the embodiment of fear that was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery on Oa. As time passed, the entity became known as the yellow impurity, the cause for the power rings' weakness to the color yellow.Green Lantern: Rebirth #3 (2005) Thaal Sinestro, at the time the universe's greatest Green Lantern, was sent to Earth by Supernova in a plot to erase Guy Gardner from history. Booster Gold was assigned to prevent this from happening. To do so, he convinced Sinestro to leave Earth, claiming that he was an admirer from the future, and that his yellow Legion of Super-Heroes flight ring was a tribute to Sinestro. When asked what Corps he belongs to, Booster ad-libbed, \\"The...Sinestro Corps\\", leading Sinestro to twirl his mustache in thought while mumbling, \\"Of course...Of course.\\"Booster Gold #2 (2007) After Sinestro went rogue, he was banished by the Guardians of the Universe to Qward in the antimatter universe. When he returned, he wielded a power ring which used yellow energy. After various encounters with Earth's Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, he was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery. There he was able to use his ring, which uses fear, as opposed to willpower, as a power source, to awaken Parallax from hibernation. From there, Parallax and Sinestro were able to influence the fall of Hal Jordan and instigate the fall of the Green Lantern Corps, leaving one last Green Lantern: Kyle Rayner.Green Lantern vol. 3 #50 (1994)Green Lantern: Rebirth #4 (2005) Recruitment drive The Sinestro Corps gathers on Qward. After the Green Lantern Corps was restarted with the return of Hal Jordan,Green Lantern: Rebirth #6 (2005) the Sinestro Corps began actively recruiting members, offering yellow power rings and a role in the Corps to those who can \\"instill great fear\\". Members of the Corps are immediately taken to Qward to \\"...be subjected to psychological and physical reconditioning\\". The members of the Sinestro Corps work in sectors, like the Green Lantern Corps. Qward also has a huge yellow Central Battery on its surface like the one used on Oa. Although the Sinestro Corps uses fear, and opposes the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians, Sinestro has stated their goal is to bring order to the universe, which he claims the Guardians have failed to do. Arkillo, a large and muscular vicious alien, is enslaving all the Qwardian Weaponers and forcing them to continuously build new yellow rings which are programmed to breach the barrier between the antimatter and matter universes to find and recruit new ring-wielders. Arkillo also serves as the Sinestro Corps' drill sergeant, similar to Kilowog's role in the GLC.Green Lantern vol. 4 #11 Members recruited include Karu-Sil, raised by animals; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; and Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away.Wizard Magazine #184 (February 2007), 2007 Preview, Sinestro Corps. During this time, the Sinestro Corps attempted to recruit Batman, known even to some alien races for his formidable ability to instill fear in others. However, Batman's willpower combined with his previous brief exposure to a power ring allowed him to reject the yellow ring before it took him to be properly trained and molded into one of Sinestro's soldiers. The yellow ring then sought a replacement and selected Amon Sur, the disgruntled son of Abin Sur, who was on Earth attempting to steal Hal Jordan's ring.Green Lantern vol. 4 #17 (April 2007) The prophecy It was revealed that after untold millennia, the Weaponers of Qward, Ranx the Sentient City, the Children of the White Lobe, and the Empire of Tears will rise united against the Green Lantern Corps.Tales of the Green Lanterns Corps Annual #2 (1986) This was largely ignored up until upgraded Manhunters started to appear throughout the universe. Hal Jordan encountered one on Earth and, with Guy Gardner, followed their trail to Sector 3601. Hal and Guy found several Green Lanterns, all of whom were assumed to have been killed during the Emerald Twilight saga, and the Manhunters' new grandmaster Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman. The Manhunters were defeated and Henshaw's head was brought to Oa.Green Lantern vol. 4 #15 (2005) The Book of Oa has a forbidden chapter on cosmic prophecies, which includes the following: After his interrogation, the Guardians learned that Henshaw is aware of the fifty-two parallel universes and that if New Earth was destroyed, the new Multiverse would collapse and the Antimatter universe would take its place. Two of the Guardians, Ganthet and Sayd, warn the other Guardians not to ignore the prophecy because it could destroy the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 (2007) The Sinestro Corps War Following his defeat in Green Lantern: Rebirth, the events of Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 Sinestro retreats to the planet Qward in the antimatter universe.

Meanwhile, Mongul (who had since obtained a yellow ring in the aftermath of the war) begins his quest to take command of the Sinestro Corps in their namesake's absence. After obtaining an additional five rings by killing corpsmen who refused to follow him, Mongul takes over the planet Daxam and then a large contingent of the Sinestro Corps, after besting Arkillo in one- on-one combat, he becomes the new leader of the Sinestro Corps.

Their rescue attempt is temporarily spoiled by an attack from Atrocitus and his newly formed Red Lantern Corps.Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns #1 (December 2008) Sinestro is abducted by Atrocitus' forces and brought to the Red Lantern base planet: Ysmault. Planning to use Sinestro's blood for their own means, Sinestro's faction of the Sinestro Corps eventually arrive and liberate him from the Red Lanterns. After their escape, Sinestro and his faction of the Sinestro Corps return to Qward, revealing that there is a backup Central Power Battery. Sinestro orders his men to free the Sinestro Corps members imprisoned on Zamaron by the Star Sapphires and meet him on the darkside of Daxam's moon.

Entity As the embodiment of fear which is connected to the yellow light of the Emotional Spectrum, Parallax is revealed to be the emotional entity for the Sinestro Corps. Born when one of the earliest life forms first felt terror, it is insect-like in appearance. Parallax was the first of the seven entities to be captured by a still unknown person and currently is held captive in Ryut. The Sinestro Corps insignia is based on drawings created by life forms who looked into the mouth of Parallax, and lived to tell the tale. Book of Parallax This book apparently holds in its pages all the history of the greatest Sinestro Corpsmen histories. For unknown reasons the book was chained to Lyssa Drak with yellow energy from Sinestro himself. This was possibly for the need to have a historian for his Corps and a way for Sinestro to revisit his Corps' success. Lyssa Drak is quite loyal to Sinestro and highly devoted to updating the Book and keeping it safe. A power ring is needed to translate the Book's text into words familiar to the ring wielder. Before a candidate of the corps enters a fear lodge, their power rings are drained by the Book of Parallax. Recently, Lyssa Drak has become the embodiment of the book. Weapons and equipment A Yellow Power Ring Members of the Sinestro Corps use yellow power rings built on Qward. Though functionally similar to a Green Lantern's power ring, yellow power rings are fueled by fear instead of willpower. Members are selected for their skill at intimidation and terror. The ring amplifies the aggressive tendencies of the wearer. The yellow rings are charged by yellow power batteries, which are in turn linked to a yellow Central Power Battery based on Korugar. Aside from the recharging limitations common among the various Corps, their only known weakness is that their power can be drained by a Blue Lantern's power ring. Other versions * The Sinestro Corps is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series as creations of Parallax and the Manhunters serving as heralds. In \\"Lantern\\", the Lanterns are activated by John Stewart (possessed by Parallax) and empower villains in Arkham Asylum, but are defeated by Superman and the remaining Corpsmen.

Smallville Season 11: Chaos #4 * The Lightsmiths: In the universe prior to the current one, groups managed to tap into the wellspring of power created by the Emotional Spectrum. In this universe those who tapped into the yellow light were known as the Lightsmiths of the Yellow Light of Terror.Green Lantern #23.1 In other media=Television * In Batman: The Brave and the Bold, an alternate universe version of Sinestro as a hero is presented on the Injustice Syndicate earth. He possess a slight variation of his Sinestro Corps uniform. * The Sinestro Corps appear in Justice League Action. Known members are Sinestro and Despotellis. In \\"The Ringer,\\" Sinestro was battling Hal Jordan while Despotellis was guarding the Sinestro Corps Battery in Sinestro's ring even when Superman, Wonder Woman, and Atom joined the fight. When Atom defeated Despotellis by changing his chemical structure, this shorted out Sinestro's ring, allowing Green Lantern to defeat Sinestro. Film * In the animated movie Green Lantern: First Flight, when Sinestro is given possession of the yellow power battery and ring, his Green Lantern uniform transforms into a uniform exactly the same as his Sinestro Corps uniform in the comics, complete with the same symbol. Aside from the uniform, however, there are subtle indications that Sinestro had the same plans for an organized military force. * The Sinestro Corps appear in Green Lantern: Emerald Knights as part of a prophecy that Atrocitus tells Abin Sur of. Besides Sinestro, several prominent members are featured: Arkillo, Lyssa Drak, Kryb, Maash, Karu-Sil, Romat-Ru, Slussh and Tri-eye. * In the 2011 film Green Lantern, allusions of the Sinestro Corps are evident. The Guardians detail a flashback featuring the rogue Guardian Krona approaching the Sinestro Corps symbol with the desire to conquer fear as a weapon. The closing scene of the film also features Sinestro putting on the newly crafted yellow ring, whereupon his uniform changes to that of the Sinestro Corps. Video games * The members of the Sinestro Corps make a cameo appearance during Hal Jordan's ending depicted in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. They are shown battling the Green Lantern Corps for control of the Pyramid of Argus. * The Sinestro Corps appear in DC Universe Online. The rings of the Sinestro Corp have been experiencing malfunctions and they blame the Green Lanterns. Arkillo appears as a bounty for Heroes. * In the video game Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters, while the Sinestro Corps do not feature directly, the Manhunters acquire similar powers to the Sinestro Corps when they attempt to harness the power of the yellow energy kept contained by the Guardians to use as a weapon against the Green Lantern Corps. * The Sinestro Corps version of Batman is a playable skin in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows version of Batman: Arkham City. The skin can be unlocked by using a code contained in the Blu-ray of the Green Lantern film (code only available for PS3), by purchasing the Arkham City Skins Pack which features all available skins (which is available for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.http://arkhamcity.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=4&t;=4642 ), or by purchasing the \\"Game of The Year\\" edition of Arkham City. The costume is also available in Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition for the Nintendo Wii U. * In the parallel universe of Injustice: Gods Among Us, Hal Jordan has joined the Sinestro Corps in his role as enforcer for Superman's Regime, with Sinestro as another agent of the Regime. Hal‚Äôs transformation into \\"Yellow Lantern\\" was a result of Sinestro playing him and framing Guy Gardner for John Stewart‚Äôs death, whom Sinestro murdered behind Hal‚Äôs back. When Superman is nearly killed by a kryptonite bullet fired by Black Canary, a yellow power ring finds him which he uses to remove the bullet. He then seemingly kills Canary while becoming a member of the Sinestro Corps. Nightwing, who in this reality is Damian Wayne, becomes a member of the Sinestro Corps in his Single Player ending. ** The sequel game Injustice 2 reveals that Doctor Fate actually saved Canary from Sinestro‚Äôs attack, and that she faked her death by sending her to another universe where she died instead of their universe‚Äôs Green Arrow, until she and her son are brought back to their universe alongside the alternate Green Arrow, after Regime‚Äôs defeat. In the prequel comics for the game, it is shown that, some time during his rehabilitation, Hal Jordan learned the truth behind John Stewart‚Äôs death and, eneraged that he was manipulated by Sinestro into murdering Guy Gardner, attracts the Red Lantern Corps, who attempt to have him join their ranks. In Hal‚Äôs ending, Sinestro escapes from his cell where he supposedly died during the Red Lanterns' and Starro‚Äôs attacks, forcing Hal to become a Yellow Lantern once again and go undercover to apprehend him, though he expresses his concerns that the ring‚Äôs fear spectrum might take over his mind. * The Sinestro Corps appear in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham.

At least 108 Retrieved on March 21, 2007 people were reported to have been killed by the blast, which occurred at a depth of about 270 meters (885 feet) at 10:19 local time (3:19 GMT). The mine disaster was Russia's deadliest in more than a decade. Kemerovo Oblast governor Aman Tuleyev said that when the blast occurred, \\"the mine was preparing to launch \\"Eighteen\\" an advanced mining safety system developed in the UK. The system signaled a sudden discharge of a large amount of methane and caving at 14:30 local time.\\" According to the Russian Prosecutor General's office, \\"the explosion occurred when equipment was being tested\\". The explosive agent is thought to have been either methane or coal dust. The main theory for the cause of the explosion is that it resulted from \\"a breach of mining safety\\". However, the mine operator has denied any connection between the explosion and the new equipment. Among the dead was a British mining consultant, Ian Robertson, who worked for the Anglo-German company International Mining Consultancy. According to Russian sources, the company was involved in auditing the mine's coal reserves. He was accompanied by most of the mine's senior management, who had gone underground shortly before the explosion; the entire party was caught in the blast.78 Confirmed Dead in Siberian Coal Mine Blast The audit was reportedly being conducted in conjunction with the mine operator's planned initial public offering of stock shares to obtain cash for a $700 million investment programme. The operator of the mine is Yuzhkuzbassugol (\\"South Kuzbass Coal\\"), a half-owned associate of the Evraz Group conglomerate, which is Russia's largest producer of deep-mined coal. The mine, which opened in 2002, is one of the newest pits in the Kuzbass coal-mining region of Siberia, with modern equipment made in the UK and Germany. It has been producing at an annual rate of about 1.5 million tonnes of coking coal concentrate. In the aftermath of the accident it was revealed that the mine had suffered \\"problems with equipment safety rules\\".Russians Find Violations at Coal Mine - TownHall.com - Obtained March 26, 2007. It was also announced that 60 coal mines in the surrounding area were to be inspected for similar violations soon after the disaster, and that the entirety of the nation's mines would be inspected during the coming weeks. Preliminary findings from the Ulyanovskaya investigation found that safety equipment had been tampered with deliberately to decrease the readings of methane levels in the mine. According to Governor Tulayev, this was done \\"consciously in order to increase coal production\\". Five mine inspectors were subsequently dismissed for allowing the mine operator to \\"breach safety rules in order to make a profit.\\" The blast was said to have been caused by sparks from an exposed cable igniting methane gas, which then ignited coal dust.

Overview Somali Culture Fair in Helsinki. The first Somali immigrants came to Finland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, 44 Somali students studying in the Soviet Union immigrated to Finland. Between 1990 and 1995, the number of Somalia citizens in Finland increased from 44 to 4,044. The first arrivals were university students from Soviet universities in the former Soviet Union (see Zahra Abdulla). Later, more asylum seekers arrived directly from Somalia, many through a program of family unification. In 2010, it was estimated by the Finnish immigration service (Migri) that a majority of all Somali refugees arriving in Finland were illiterate due to the Somali Civil War having destroyed the opportunities for those born after the 70s to attend the school system. A 2012 Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos (THL) survey of Somalia-born immigrants in Finland found that, prior to their arrival, around 50% of males and 50% of females had attended primary school (Peruskoulu), 39% of males and 17% of females had attended high school (Lukio), and 11% of males and 33% of females had not attended school (Ei lainkaan).; also cf. Sandvik 2016, p.29: En dryg tredjedel av de somaliska kvinnorna hade aldrig g√•tt i skola och ca en tiondel av dem svarade att de l√§ser hj√§lpligt eller √§r analfabeter. According to Statistics Finland, in 2012, 77.9% of Somalia-born immigrants in Finland had attained a lower secondary or unknown education level, 17.9% had attained an upper secondary education level, and 4.2% had attained a tertiary education level. A Somali man and Finnish friends at a celebration in Helsinki. Like other immigrant groups in Finland, particularly Muslims, Somalis have been targets of hate crimes. According to a 2009 report by the Police College of Finland, 8% of total victims were Somali-born, while representing only 4% of suspected offenders. Most suspected perpetrators are young Finnish men, with similarly-aged Somali, Iraqi and Turkish immigrants mainly targeted. According to social workers, the pressure of living between two disparate cultures has also resulted in instances of petty crime amongst disaffected 17- to 20-year-olds in the Somali community. The situation is compounded by the unfamiliarity of Somali parents with the various social services that are available to address similar circumstances. To tackle the issue, Somali community organizations have teamed up with Finnish police and social services officials, with the municipal authorities in Helsinki endeavouring to recruit more Somali social workers. In 2015, five young Somalis were suspects in a case of gang rape in Tapanila near Helsinki. The incident hardened the attitudes towards Somalis in Finland. Of the five accused, three were sentenced and two were acquitted. Four of the accused were minors and two of those therefore received shorter sentences. As with many other immigrant groups in Finland, Somalis have also faced some barriers to employment, due in part to the local economic recession. However, the situation has steadily improved over the years, as more Somali immigrants have found employment in their own community, although much of this work is unmeasured. While some Somalis with language training have found jobs in their own field, others, like immigrants in general, have obtained short-term work positions. Demographics Number of Somali native speakers residing in Finland (1990-2015). Somalis are one of the largest ethnic minorities in Finland, and the largest group of people of non-European origin. They are the fourth-largest minority in the country, after Finland-Swedes, Russians, Latvians and Estonians. In 2018, there were 6,448 Somali citizens, but an equal number may have received Finnish citizenship. According to the Finnish National newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, the number of Somali-speaking people in Finland in 2010 rose by nearly 10% in a year. In 2018, there were 20,944 Somali speakers in Finland. 11,776 were born in Somalia. 78% of Somalis live in Uusimaa, 8% in Southwest Finland, 3% in Pirkanmaa and 11% in rest of Finland. 35% of Somalis are under- aged.http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vaerak/030_vaerak_tau_102.px/?rxid=ce1e23ee-e657-4ecc-b858-3dc8aa95c74a The fertility rate of Somali women was 3.50 between 2012 and 2014, compared to 1.86 of Finnish women. Culture Religion is more important to Somali families than it is to Finnish families. Even though nearly all Somalis are Muslim, there are differences between families and individuals on how norms are perceived and obeyed. The clothing of Somali women in Finland varies from big hijabs and face covers to skinny jeans and crop tops. There are also Christian converts and Somali atheists in Finland.http://www.seurakuntalainen.fi/uutiset/paakaupunkiseudulle-rukoillaan- kristittyjen-somalien-seurakuntaa/ P√§√§kaupunkiseudulle rukoillaan kristittyjen somalien seurakuntaahttp://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/han/somalitaustainen- koomikko-luopui-islamista-nyt-fathi-ahmed-pelkaa- seurauksia/?shared=286803-93c04996-500 Somalitaustainen koomikko luopui islamista ‚Äì nyt Fathi Ahmed pelk√§√§ seurauksia Somalis watch at least nine different Somali channels in Finland.

People from Toledo. The first Arabic numerals in the West. The Codex Vigilanus or Codex Albeldensis (Spanish: C√≥dice Vigilano or Albeldense) is an illuminated compilation of various historical documents accounting for a period extending from antiquity to the 10th century in Hispania. Among the many texts brought together by the compilers are the canons of the Visigothic Councils of Toledo, the Liber Iudiciorum, the decrees of some early popes and other patristic writings, historical narratives (such as the Cr√≥nica AlbeldenseAlso Chronicon Albeldense or Epitome Ovetense. and a life of Mohammed), various other pieces of civil and canon law, and a calendar. The compilers were three monks of the Riojan monastery of San Mart√≠n de Albelda: Vigila, after whom it was named and who was the illustrator; Serracino, his friend; and Garc√≠a, his disciple. The first compilation was finished in 881, but was updated up to 976. The original manuscript is preserved in the library of El Escorial (as Escorialensis d I 2). At the time of its compilation, Albelda was the cultural and intellectual centre of the Kingdom of Pamplona. The manuscripts celebrate with illustrations not only the ancient Gothic kings who had reformed the law -- Chindasuinth, Reccesuinth, and Ergica -- but also its contemporary dedicatees, the rulers of Navarre: Sancho II of Pamplona and his queen, Urraca, and his brother Ramiro Garc√©s, King of Viguera. The Codex contains, among other pieces of useful information, the first mention and representation of Arabic numerals (save zero) in the West. They were introduced by the Arabs into Spain around 900. The illuminations are stylistically unique, combining Visigothic, Mozarabic, and Carolingian elements.

She lived with the Yanomami for about two decades (variously given as 20, 22, or 24 years). While living with the Yanoama, Valero married twice and gave birth to four children (three sons and one daughter). She escaped in 1956 to what she refers to as \\"the white man\\" in the country of her birth. After rejection by her family and living in poverty at a mission, Valero chose to return to life with the Yanomami. Valero recounted her life's story to Italian anthropologist Ettore Biocca, who published the account in 1965. In the book, Valero tells of life in the forest: hunter-gatherer living in the Amazon; the customs, lore, rituals, and observances of Yanomami culture; and the relationships and wars between individuals, families, and tribes. The book includes detailed information about life in several Yanomami tribes. Its authenticity is accepted by anthropologists.  Compilation  Ettore Biocca, an Italian anthropologist, compiled information about Valero's experience among the Yanoama from tape recordingsValero (1996), Preface by Ettore Biocca. he made of Valero between 1962 and 1963. Biocca used a three-pronged method: asking the same questions, listening to the same stories several times, and comparing each story to the others. He found no inconsistency. Biocca also published other volumes of Valero's accounts, which include a great deal of information on the culture of the Yanoama. Plot summary=Part One (from kidnapping to living with the Namoeteri) Helena is a girl of Spanish descent (\\"white girl\\" in the book), who lives next to a river near the Amazon forest with her family of subsistence farmers. When she is a preadolescent (between 11 and 13 years old),Valero (1996), Introduction: Two Irreconcilable Worlds by Jacques Lizot.Valero (1996), p. 23. the family is attacked by native warriors (\\"Indians\\" in the book). She is wounded and captured by one of the Yanoama tribes, and they take her to live with them. She lives with a tribe called the Shamateri. After accidentally giving poisonous toad eggs to a child, the father wants to kill Helena so she escapes into the forest and subsequently lives there for seven months. Eventually, she reaches a tribe called the Namoeteri. At first she is not well received. She unintentionally makes the mistake of insulting them, and she believes that her life is in danger. She flees to the forest once again, and is later caught. Part Two (life with Fusiwe, headman of the Namoeteri) Fusiwe, the man who catches Helena, is the headman of the Namoeteri tribe. In time, she falls in love with him and she eventually becomes his fourth and youngest wife. Fusiwe tells her many stories and myths from the Yanoama tradition. Helena also narrates incidents from the war, intrigues, betrayals, and political conflicts of the Yanoama. After the birth of two sons, Fusiwe is killed by an opposing tribe. Part Three (from Akawe to \\"the white man\\") After Fusiwe's death, the opposing tribe plots to kill her sons out of fear that they would grow up and avenge their father's death. Helena takes them to a distant tribe that was uninvolved with the concerns of the Namoeteri tribe. After some time she marries again, this time to a man named Akawe. She bears him two children: a boy and a girl. There her life is not consistent, as she and Akawe often move between villages. Akawe also treats her rather poorly. Her life is under threat again when the tribe that had killed Fusiwe relocates to live near her. That, combined with her husband's insanity, persuades her to move back among white men. The last chapter is entitled \\"The wicked world of the white man.\\" Helena bitterly recounts how nobody takes care of her among the whites, and that she often goes hungry. After a while, Helena decides to return to live with the Yanomami.

The MG 81 was developed by Mauser as a derivative of their successful MG 34 general-purpose machine gun. Development focus was to reduce production cost and time and to optimize the machine gun for use in aircraft. Developed in 1938/1939, it was in production from 1940 to 1945. A special twin-mount MG 81Z (the Z suffix stands for Zwilling, meaning \\"twin\\") was introduced in 1942. It paired up two of the weapons on one mount to provide even more firepower with a maximum cyclic rate of fire of 3,200 rounds per minute without requiring much more space than a standard machine gun. Towards the end of the war many specimens were delivered to the army and equipped for use in ground battles with shoulder rest and bipod. A German twin-mount MG 81 Z aircraft MG - view from the Luftwaffe manual, 1944. Applications The MG 81Z was found in many unique installations in Luftwaffe combat aircraft, such as a pair of MG 81Z (for a total of four guns) installed in the hollow tail cone of the Dornier Do 217. Designated R19 (R for R√ºstsatz) as a factory designed field conversion/upgrade kit, it allowed the pilot of the Do 217 to shoot at pursuers.

It was hosted by interviewer Jeremy Borash, with occasional appearances by Don West. The show purported to feature \\"exclusive footage, interviews, previews, reviews, news updates, merchandise deals and more,\\" and was, in fact, used as a supplement to TNA's main program, Impact Wrestling, and was used to further angles, debut wrestlers, and advertise merchandising deals (generally good for one day). History Before the debut of TNA Today, TNA had a number of other internet exclusive shows, including TNA Global Impact! and audio only podcasts. In 2007, the company debuted \\"Hot News Updates\\" on their websites, which eventually came together as TNA Today. The show is mostly hosted on YouTube, though for a short time the TNA account was suspended for unspecified reasons and the show was uploaded to MySpace TV until the suspension was lifted. In the September 14, 2007 edition, it was shown that TNA Today was YouTube's #1 video of the day 13 times in the month of August 2007. On April 27, 2010, the show began airing live every weekday on TNA's official website. TNA En Espanol In 2008, a Spanish-language version of TNA Today debuted on TNA's website hosted by Spanish-language announcer Willie Urbina. The program also featured exclusive interviews conducted by his broadcast partner Hector Guerrero. Spin Cycle In May 2008, TNA added a new web cast called TNA Spin Cycle, a roundtable discussion between employees of TNA Wrestling discussing different topics. Jeremy Borash hosted the show while Shark Boy or The Beautiful People run the \\"Dirty Laundry\\" segment. Hermie's Hotseat Beginning March 27, 2009, former NASCAR driver Hermie Sadler debuted a web cast called Hermie's Hotseat, which features a candid sit-down interview with various TNA performers and employees. TNAtion In 2009, TNA launched a TNAtion website dedicated to promoting and marketing TNA programming and products. SoCal Val and Consequences Creed co-host a web cast along with Alex Abrahantes that includes a TNA Impact! recap, questions and answers from TNA performers, and behind the scenes information about using the TNAtion website. Alex Abrahantes was the man behind the creation and day-to-day operations of the program. Pillow Talk In December 2010, SoCal Val debuted a web cast called Pillow Talk, which featured a candid sit-down interview with various TNA performers and employees. iMPACT Xtra In November 2010, The weekly iMPACT Xtra, featuring exclusive footage you won't see on SpikeTV TNA Today Return On June 7, 2012 during the TNA Impact Wrestling post-show Jeremy Borash announced that TNA Today would return airing during the week having shows on Monday through Wednesday. The show officially returned June 12, 2012. Guests that have appeared on TNA Today are Bobby Roode, Joseph Park, Austin Aries, Billy Corgan, Bob Ryder, Brooke Tessmacher, Madison Rayne, Al Snow, Robbie E, Mike Tenay, Jeff Hardy, & TNA President Dixie Carter. Special features TNA Today commonly featured matches culled from Xplosion, as well as recaps of videos featured during the main TNA Impact! broadcasts. As of September 2007, TNA took a new approach, having Jeremy Borash approach ringside at the end of the show and pick up briefly where the show left off. While providing a new perspective, this did not really change much of the material of the show, as Borash's occasional attempts for immediate interviews were often ignored. Alternate locations for the hosting of the show included on-site appearances in towns hosting pay per views or fan festivals. TNA Today also featured exclusives not available on mainstream television. The most common feature was the revelation of new products and deals, such as upcoming merchandise (T-shirts, action figures, DVDs, etc.) and Don West's \\"Insane Deals\\". In addition, TNA Today offered interviews not available on any other show, which varies between established wrestlers (such as Frankie Kazarian), newcomers making their TNA debut (such as Talia Madison and Angel Williams), and even several exclusive appearances from TNA President Dixie Carter, who does not otherwise appear on TNA programming other than the occasional cameo in the crowd. Following the establishment of the new TNA World Championships, TNA Today held a special feature in which management director Jim Cornette presented Kurt Angle, Team 3D, and Chris Sabin with the reworked versions of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, TNA World Tag Team Championship, and TNA X Division Championship, respectively. On the 12/31 addition, live in Oshawa, Ontario, Jeremy Borash said that people in the TNA office are thinking about having a TNA PPV in Canada.

The album took eight months to complete, a change from Noble Savage which was recorded in only a few weeks, and was finally released in October 1988. It received scarce promotion and distribution by their small label, resulting in very low sales. The songs of this album follow in style and content the music of the previous album Noble Savage, adding a more polished sound and production. At the time of release, the band faced legal and financial setbacks that brought to the unofficial disbandment of Virgin Steele. Joe O'Reilly, although credited for playing bass on the album, was ill at the time of recording and was ghosted by DeFeis and Pursino.

Playing career=Juniors Lajeunesse was born in Montreal, Quebec. He started playing hockey in his hometown of Montreal with the Montreal Junior Canadiens of the OHA. The young defenceman scored 22 points in combination with 172 penalty minutes in his first season with the team and helped them win the Memorial Cup. The following season in 1969‚Äì70, Lajeunesse scored 29 points and saw his penalty minutes decrease almost by half with only 87 on the season and again helped the team win their second consecutive Memorial Cup. He was proving that he could control the flow of the game with his big hits and intensity. This would prove to pay off for Lajeunesse, as the Detroit Red Wings drafted him with their first pick, 12th overall, in the 1970 NHL amateur draft. Pro Lajeunesse started off in Detroit's farm team, the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Hockey League. He only played in 12 games before being brought up to help the Red Wings on November 12, 1970 against the St. Louis Blues. It was hoped that his toughness and grit could make a difference with the struggling club which featured such legends as Gordie Howe and Alex Delvecchio. In the remaining 62 games of the 1970‚Äì71 NHL season, Lajeunesse tacked on 55 penalty minutes, contributed four assists, and scored what was to be his lone NHL goal. This was not what the Wings were expecting. After the Wings failed to reach the playoffs again that year, Lajeunesse was re-assessed and sent back down to the minors. The following season saw Lajeunesse bouncing back and forth in the Wings' organization. He spent time with the Tidewater Wings of the AHL and Fort Worth, while suiting up for seven games in Detroit. He contributed 20 penalty minutes in those seven games without scoring a point and finished the 1971‚Äì72 season back in Fort Worth where he helped with a short playoff run. He continued playing in the minor leagues with Tidewater (now renamed the Virginia Wings) in 1972‚Äì73 before being called back to Detroit to fill in for injuries. Lajeunesse played in 28 NHL games that year and ended with one assist to go with 26 penalty minutes. The Wings had had enough and Lajeunesse was traded on May 15, 1973 to the Philadelphia Flyers for Rick Foley. He started off in the Flyers' farm system and would retire there. Lajeunesse only saw action in six more NHL games with Philadelphia in the following two seasons (both seeing Philadelphia win the Stanley Cup). He helped his AHL team the Richmond Robins reach the playoffs in three consecutive seasons (1973‚Äì74, 1974‚Äì75, 1975‚Äì76), but failed to help them get past the second round. Lajeunesse retired from hockey in 1976.

The critically praised novel is set in Africa, London and East Timor. It describes the dangerous world of war correspondents and aid workers. In the Denver Post, the reviewer of The Canal House wrote:\\"A story presented in prose so fine it nearly sings, peopled with characters who burn themselves into your mind and heart.\\" His work appears in Politically Inspired a collection of essays and short stories about the Iraq war published by MacAdam/Cage.

The book was illustrated by Kurt Cyrus. The Wall Street Journal reviewer wrote: ‚ÄúAs mystifying as it may be to their mothers and sisters, small boys tend to be entranced by powerful vehicles. The very fact of trucks‚Äîlet alone their variety and different purposes‚Äîgives a thrill to certain 3- to 6-year-olds.

Picture by William Cecil Slingsby, 1915. Climbing The mountain had several attempts at first ascents. First was the German Paul G√ºssfeldt and the Norwegian Martin Ekroll in the summer of 1888. The Dane Carl Hall and the Norwegian mountain guide Mathias Soggemoen attempted in 1889. Neither group succeeded, but Carl Hall built a cairn on the lower summit about southeast of the main summit. That cairn is now called Halls fortopp (elevation ). In 1904, William Cecil Slingsby also failed to reach the summit. It was not until 30 July 1910 that Ferdinand Schjelderup, Carl Wilhelm Rubenson, and Alf Bonnevie Bryn finally reached the summit of Stetind. The weather conditions were good. It was Rubenson's 25th birthday, and he was given the honor of being first in the rope. The hardest part was to pass the smooth crag \\"Mysosten\\", which Rubenson finger traversed along a tiny crack. After this passage there was an easy climb to the summit. The same three climbers continued their 1910 tour by making first ascents of the Lofoten summits Svolv√¶rgeita and Trakta. Arne N√¶ss, Ralph H√∏ibakk, and K. Friis Baasted did the first winter climb of Stetind in 1963 on the eastern wall. In 1966, Arne N√¶ss and four others were the first ones to summit via the west wall. Name The shape of the mountain has been compared with a ste which means \\"anvil\\" and the last element is the finite form of tind which means \\"mountain peak\\".

Born in Dobrich on 19 July 1916, Spisarevski moved with his family after the post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly ceded the city to Romania, consecutively living in Lom, Belogradchik and Sofia. Spisarevski entered His Majesty's Military School, but was subsequently expelled and went to serve in Yambol. Due to his excellent conduct, he was called back as a cadet to the school. When a pilot contest was announced, he was among the first candidates for the new subject. Later, he went on to study in Nazi Germany, where he graduated from the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen in 1938. In the summer of 1943, he was sent to the English Channel with another Bulgarian pilot to observe the German pilots and master aerial warfare tactics. On 20 December 1943, a group of 200 American B-24 Liberator bombers and fighter planes headed to Sofia in order to bomb the Bulgarian capital once again. 36 Bulgarian airplanes took off in order to intercept the bombers before they reached Sofia. Spisarevski was one of the Bulgarian Air Force's Messerschmitt –ú–µ-109G-2 pilots on duty in Bozhurishte who were sent to intercept the bombers before they could reach the city. According to the battle log of the 3/6 fighter wing, of which Spisarevski was part, the battle went the following way: the American B-24 aircraft flew towards Sofia in V-shaped formations of three, echeloned in a long rear column. The Bulgarians formed an opposing battle row, echeloned in squadrons of four in a rear column, at 6,000 m. The wing had the task to engage the enemy P-38 Lightning fighters while at the same time the other wing, 2/6, would hit the bombers and force them to release their bombs outside the city. Flying Officer Spisarevski's aircraft failed to start and he took off in a reserve plane with some delay in what would be his first and only aerial battle. When he reached the bombers, the battle had already begun. Spisarevski evaded two American fighters, headed to a group of 16 Liberators and, without ceasing fire, crashed into the leading bomber. The bomber split in mid-air and only the tail gunner survived. Spisarevski's machine crashed at the heights near the village of Pasarel close to Sofia. His body was found among the debris. The hit American bomber crashed on the other side of the village. For the taking down of a four-engine bomber, he was credited posthumously with three aerial victories and promoted to the rank of captain. Spisarevski was buried in the Central Sofia Cemetery, in the Walk of Pilots.

Molecular biology  The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p13.2) on the plus (Watson) strand. It is 224,161 bases in length organised into 23 exons. The encoded protein has 4,167 amino acids and molecular weight of 460,937 Da. Three isofoms are known. The protein itself has a large tandem-repeat domain comprising 34 imperfect repetitions of 47 amino acids. Mutations associated with disease are usually found in exons 8, 10 and 16. The gene is expressed in fetal tissues including the aorta, brain, eye, kidney, liver, lung, olfactory bulb, pancreas, skeletal muscle, spleen and testis. The protein is found in the cytoplasm, centrosome, cell projections and cilium basal body. During mitosis it localizes to both spindle poles.  Function  Knockdown of Alms1 by short interfering RNA in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells caused defective ciliogenesis. Cilia were stunted and treated cells lacked the ability to increase calcium influx in response to mechanical stimuli. Disease association Mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been found to be causative for Alstr√∂m syndrome with a total of 81 disease-causing mutations. Multiple mutations are known: the current (2007) total is 79. These include both nonsense and frameshift mutations. Most of the mutations have been found in exons 8,10 and 16.

It serves as the Amtrak train station for the Greater Charleston area as well as a bus terminus for the Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA) and Southeastern Stages, a regional intercity bus common carrier. The street address is 4565 Gaynor Avenue, and is located in the Liberty Hill neighborhood. History Project for the current station began in 1996 with a feasibility study and site selection lead by CARTA. The site chosen was a tract located on West Montague Avenue, wedged between Dorchester Road and Interstate 526. From 1997-2007 the project went through a series of refinements, land purchasing and required NEPA assessments. With a 2007 groundbreaking, construction began with infrastructure and a park and ride lot. In 2009, Davis & Floyd, Inc. joined the project, providing the architectural design and engineering for the building. The final design was a two-story double-towered edifice, evoking the architecture style of the Charleston Union Station that existed from 1907 to 1947. The facility was to included leasable space, restaurant/retail space, CARTA administration offices, additional meeting space and operations for Amtrak, CARTA and Southeastern Stages. In 2010, the project qualified for the State of Good Repair Program, providing Federal dollars from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). In 2012, because of the close proximity to the CSX Bennett Yard, the company rejected a platform permit without sidetrack. Additional costs related to constructing a sidetrack, so the station would not impede freight rail traffic, made the site no longer cost feasible thus stopping the project. In 2014, CARTA began the process of relocating the project to Gaynor Avenue, adjacent to the existing Amtrak station. new NEPA and NHPA assessments were started as well zoning, permits, redesign and disposal of the Montague Avenue site. Bus tests were conducted on July 29, 2014 to confirm vertical clearance under Sevenmile Viaduct. In 2015, project management and ownership was transferred from CARTA to the city of North Charleston. To keep costs within the $14.5 million budget, the new facility was downsized from to , eliminating the leasable space, restaurant/retail space and CARTA administration offices. On February 2, 2016, the FTA gave final approval citing no significant impact on the environment. Phase one of construction began on August 24, 2017 with the new building and reconstruction of one-half of the side platform. The North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center officially opened with early-morning train service on December 13, 2018. In 2019, phase two of construction includes the razing of the Atlantic Coast Line depot, reconstructing the remaining half of the side platform, roadway modifications, CARTA bus turnoffs and vehicle parking. Atlantic Coast Line depot The former Atlantic Coast Line/Amtrak station, located west of the new intermodal center Opened in 1956, the Atlantic Coast Line (ACL) depot reflects mid-century modern design popular at the time of construction. It is characterized by clean lines and minimal ornamentation. Typical features of the mid-century modern aesthetic found in the Charleston depot include a flat roof, large groupings of windows with horizontal lights, and shallow cantilevered canopies at the first and second floors. Red brick and dyed-green concrete panels arranged in alternating horizontal bands emphasize the building's rectilinear lines. Public spaces feature exposed brick on the lower walls and floors of durable green terrazzo; both materials can stand the wear and tear of large crowds and are easy to maintain. Passenger service was located on the first floor. As the station was built during the height of segregation, it was built with two separate waiting areas, each with their own sets of restrooms. In the days of segregation, whites used one waiting area and blacks used the other. The second floor housed the ACL freight office for the Charleston division; the office closed when became part of CSX Transportation's Florence division. In 1967, ACL merged with Seaboard Air Line Railroad to become Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). In 1971, passenger operations was transferred to Amtrak, while the station remained owned by SCL (later CSX Transportation). In 1972, the city of North Charleston was incorporated. In the 1980s, fencing topped with barbed wire surrounded the station after a rash of burglaries. On December 13, 2018, all passenger rail service was relocated to the North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center and the former Atlantic Coast Line/Amtrak station was officially closed. Because the station was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the City of North Charleston and CARTA made an agreement with the South Carolina State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) that they will provide measured drawings and professional photography of the interior and exterior, to be submitted to SHPO and Clemson University as the repositories. An erection of a state historic marker. And salvage one of the exterior green tiles (before or during demolition) and include it and other photographs and information related to the station in the North Charleston Intermodal Transportation Center museum space. Services The station is served by two Amtrak routes, for a total of four trains daily: *The (daytime train), with the northbound train at 10:00am and the southbound train at 7:19pm. *The (overnight train), with the northbound train at 9:17pm and the southbound train at 4:51am. Amtrak operating hours are at 4:00am‚Äì11:45am and at 4:00pm‚Äì11:45pm, which includes the ticket counter, passenger assistance and baggage service. The station appears in Amtrak timetables as Charleston. Layout The nearly single-story station is constructed in brown brick and textured concrete masonry units, with stylized pilasters that visually break up the long, horizontal facades. At one end is a tower, while a projecting bay with triangular parapet and clock face marks the main entrance. A network of canopies protect travelers from inclement weather as they arrive or depart by car, bus or rail. The steeply pitched, hipped seamed-metal roof has prominent shed dormer windows that, along with numerous other windows at ground level, allow natural light into the facility. The interior is setup with an entry concourse, Amtrak concourse and passenger concourse through the center connecting CARTA and Southeastern Stages at opposite ends. The floor has light and dark gray diamond pattern and accented with organic stone and wood elements. The facility is fully ADA compliant and offers additional meeting space and a museum to the Liberty Hill neighborhood.

This overthrew the government of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of the republic. Early life Emmanuel Kotoka was born at Alakple, a village in the Keta district of the Volta Region of the Gold Coast (British colony). He completed his basic education at the Alakple Roman Catholic School and later the Anloga Senior School in 1941. He started training as a goldsmith but switched to a career in the military. Military career In July 1947, he enlisted as a private in the Infantry School of the Gold Coast Regiment at Teshie in Accra. He rose through the ranks, becoming a sergeant in 1948 and later Company Sergeant Major in 1951. In 1952, he was among some west African soldiers selected for training at Eaton Hall Officer Cadet School in the United Kingdom. In 1954, he was commissioned as a lieutenant and seconded to the British army on the Rhine. On his return to the (Gold Coast) (as Ghana was then called), he was made a Platoon Commander of the Second Gold Coast Regiment of Infantry. He rose to become the Second-in-Command and in 1959 became the Platoon Commander with the rank of Captain. He was promoted to the rank of Major later that year. In 1960, he attended the Company Commander's course at the School of Infantry in Warminster, England. In 1960, he was the commander of D company of the detachment of the Second Battalion of the Ghana army which made up Ghana's contingent in the United Nations Operation in the Congo deployed in the capital, Leopoldville, now Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was regarded as a national hero following this deployment. He was awarded the Ghana Service Order for Exceptional Bravery for Distinguished Service in the Congo in 1963. He later became the Commander of the Second Infantry Brigade (now the Northern Command) of the Ghana Army) located at Kumasi. Politics In 1965, the then Lieutenant-Colonel Kotoka was transferred to Kumasi where he met and became friends with then Major Akwasi Amankwa Afrifa, an officer in the Second Brigade of the Ghana army. The two are generally credited with being among the key conspirators behind the first bloody coup d'√©tat in Ghana on 24 February 1966 which brought an end to the first republic. They codenamed it \\"Operation Cold Chop\\". It was Kotoka who announced the coup to the nation early that morning from the Broadcasting House of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, the official radio station in Ghana. The Central Intelligence Agency appears to have been aware about the plotting of the coup at least a year ahead. Kotoka was promoted Major General and became a member of the ruling National Liberation Council and also the Commissioner for Ministry of Health as well as General Officer Commanding the Ghana Armed Forces. Death On 17 April 1967, there was an abortive coup attempt involving junior officers of the reconnaissance regiment located at Ho in the Volta Region. It was code named \\"Guitar-boy\\". It led to the killing of Kotoka by Lt. Moses Yeboah after heavy fighting. Lt. Moses Yeboah and another colleague were later tried and executed by a military tribunal. The Ghana International Airport was renamed Kotoka International Airport in his memory. He was killed at a spot which is now part of the forecourt of the airport and his statue used to stand at that spot, but has since been removed to way for airport expansion projects. Tribute The Irish poet, M√°ire Mhac an tSaoi, wrote a poem in his memory - \\"Sea never dry\\" published in 1968 in the magazine Comhair and subsequently in a collection called \\"Codladh an Ghaiscigh\\" published by Sairs√©al & Dill (Dublin) in 1973.

Rodrigo Aboitiz and Andr√©s Bobe were soon joined by bassist Luciano Rojas and drummer Mauricio Claveria. However, the group lacked a main vocalist and decided to try a saxophonist named Iv√°n Delgado. They soon realized that he was not the right man for the job and decided to part ways with him. At this time, Beto Cuevas was touring Chile to meet the country where he was born. Cueva's sister knew Claver√≠a's sister, and Claver√≠a decided to tell the band that Cuevas was his cousin, so he could get a chance. They quickly realized that Cuevas was their man and decided to include him in the band, which solidified the original group. After the formation of the group, they were invited to record their first album. The composition was done almost entirely by Bobe, with the participation of Cuevas on the lyrics of one song, and with some collaboration from the other members in the final phase. Soon, 500 copies of the album were released. However, the producer of the album, Carlos Fonseca, and the band got into a legal battle. Since they lacked a contract, the band left him. Reissue disputes A reissue of Desiertos was originally planned for release in 1999 (prior to the 2000 release their album Uno). However, negotiations between Cuevas and former producer Fonseca failed to reach an agreement due to Fonseca‚Äôs refusal in selling the Desiertos master recording. New attempts were made again in 2005, and this time it was Fonseca that offered to do so but then again plans had failed due to La Ley‚Äôs break up that year. In 2015, Germ√°n Bobe, the brother of the deceased band founder and guitarist Andr√©s Bobe (who died in 1994) along with former members Luciano Rojas and Rodrigo Aboitiz made their attempts to reissue the material but when Cuevas found out about the idea, he immediately opposed alleging that his line-up of La Ley were in the process of releasing the 2016 album Adaptaci√≥n. In a 2013 interview Cuevas stated that he himself had legally obtained all of the intellectual property rights of La Ley with consent of its previous members, thus himself becoming the sole proprietor.

History Southern Regional High School opened in 1957 as a junior- senior high school, housing students from Stafford Township, Barnegat Township, Ocean Township, Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Eagleswood Township, Bass River Township, and all six municipalities of Long Beach Island. Prior to the opening of Southern Regional, students from Barnegat, Ocean Township, and Long Beach Island attended the former Barnegat High School, while students from Stafford, Eagleswood, Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, and Bass River attended the former Tuckerton High School, which currently houses Tuckerton's elementary school. At first, the school only had two sports; boys' baseball and boys' basketball. Football was added in 1958, and wrestling came two years later. Girls had \\"Sports Nights\\" instead of competitive teams. It would not be until the 1960s when women's sports would first appear at Southern. Due to the quick growth of the area, a new wing and expanded gymnasium were added in 1966.The History of SRHS, Southern Regional School District. Accessed March 12, 2011. In 1970, Southern Regional Middle School opened its doors to 7th and 8th graders. However, it soon became overcrowded. Starting in 1979, students from Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Bass River, and Eagleswood, would attend the newly opened Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton. At the same time, an expansion was built onto the middle school, all ninth graders were moved from the high school to the middle school. The high school went through several changes throughout the 1990s. In December 1991, maintenance crews installing a heating system sparked the fire that damaged the guidance area and several science labs, which were later remodeled.Cronin, Steven. \\"SRHS Fire Blamed On Torches\\", The Press of Atlantic City, December 25, 1991.

At the same time, the middle school went back to housing the seventh and eighth graders. In 2004, the Barnegat High School opened, starting with only a freshman class.

Flaherty presented the 2007 budget on March 19, 2007. No income tax or GST cuts were announced but there were tax credits (of up to $310 per child) for some families with children under 18. The federal budget included $14 billion in new spending and $5.7 billion in tax cuts. This was the second budget of the 39th Canadian Parliament. Since the government held a minority, the budget needed support of at least one opposition party. On March 29, 2007, Bill C-52, the enabling legislation to implement the budget, received First Reading in the House of Commons with the support of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. The New Democratic Party and Liberal Party voted against it. The budget passed 174 to 109 in the House of Commons in first reading. It would later pass the second and third readings in June. Many politicians believe that the changes to equalization disregard the Atlantic Accord. There was speculation that some Atlantic government members would vote against the Budget, but only Bill Casey did, and was subsequently removed from Caucus. On June 22, 2007, the Senate passed the budget with a vote of 45‚Äì21, with only liberal senators from Atlantic Canada and Saskatchewan voting against it. Conservative senator Anne Cools voted against it too, which in turn led to her removal from the Conservative caucus. The bill was given royal assent by the Governor-General, Micha√´lle Jean, about two hours after the vote.  Areas of direction  Some of the key items in the budget were: * $39 billion in transfers to provinces for public services and infrastructure * $2000/child tax credit * Increase age limit for RRSPs * $9.2 billion in debt reduction * $550 million/year to combat the welfare trap * $140 million to establish a Registered Disability Savings Plan * Subsidies up to $2000 on low-emissions automobiles and excise tax on fuel-inefficient vehicles increased to 4000 * $1.5 billion in transfers to provinces for projects that combat climate change and air pollution * $400 million to implement national electronic health records * $612 million to reduce hospital wait times * $300 million for HPV vaccines * $60 million increase in Canadian Forces wages * $600 million for farmer savings plans * $400 million to offset agriculture production costs * Increase in tobacco tax to offset GST reduction These expenditures and cuts have led to some belief that this is pre-election budget, aimed at enticing voters.http://thechronicleherald.ca/Canada/565500.html \\"Federal budget could be prelude to election\\" Halifax Chronicle-Herald.ca,  Reception  The Liberals and the New Democrats announced shortly following the presentation of the budget that they would not support in its current form. Nova Scotian politicians have criticized the new equalization plan, as it cuts back payments on the assumption that various offshore programs will result in increased revenues. Nova Scotia premier Rodney MacDonald has stated that this situation is caused by the few Nova Scotian seats in the Federal Cabinet.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2007/03/20/ns- fedbudget.html \\"Equalization Plan unfair, Macdonald says\\", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.ca This is expected to be a cut of approximately 5 million dollars.http://thechronicleherald.ca/Front/565615.html \\"No fiscal fairness for N.S.\\", Halifax Chronicle-Herald Premier MacDonald later urged all his province's MPs to vote against the budget after a letter Flaherty that was published in a Nova Scotia newspaper. 9 of the 11 MPs voted against it in the third reading. After the 2007 passed, the government started to work on a comprise with Nova Scotia to settle the dispute. Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams criticized the budget as being a \\"betrayal\\" and a violation of the terms of the 2005 Atlantic Accord. Bill Casey, Conservative Member of Parliament for Cumberland‚ÄîColchester‚ÄîMusquodoboit Valley, voted against the budget, because of the unfair equalization formula for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, and the effective cancellation of the Atlantic Accord.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2007/06/04/budget-casey.html \\"Tory MP says he'll vote against budget over offshore flip-flop\\", CBC.ca He has since been removed from the Conservative caucus. Quebec Premier Jean Charest had applauded the budget, as his province would receive over $2 billion in additional equalization payment. Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader Andre Boisclair spoke in opposition to the budget, saying that the new money for Quebec was part of an effort to buy votes for the federalist Liberal Party of Quebec before the March 26, 2007 provincial election.https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070320/wl_canada_nm/canada_quebec_election_col_4 \\"Ottawa's cash stirs up Quebec election campaign\\", Reuters Saskatchewan Premier Lorne Calvert argued that his province will receive no new money and alleged that the Conservatives were favouring Ontario and Quebec at the expense of other provinces, which MP Maurice Vellacott has disputed. Other premiers including New Brunswick's Shawn Graham, British Columbia's Gordon Campbell had some reservations. However, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said that the budget represented \\"real progress\\" for his province. The Mayor of Toronto, David Miller, also criticized the budget for its alleged lack of funding for cities. Many Ontario-based and Western-Canadian columnists have supported Flaherty's budget, citing figures that indicate that the per capital income in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia has improved significantly, at the expense of Ontario, and that allowing the Maritime provinces to keep both equalization payments and resource revenues would hurt Ontario even more. . October 2007 economic statement On October 30, 2007, the Conservatives tabled an economic statement (similar to a mini-budget) and announced various tax cuts and exemptions. Overall, the government proposed a total of $60 billion in tax cuts over five years, including $14 billion in corporate tax cuts by 2012 (or a drop of 33%), a 1% drop of the GST to 5%, an increase of the basic personal tax exemption to $10,100 per year by 2009. The stated goal of the corporate tax cuts was to set Canadian corporate tax rates as the lowest in the G7, although this would require the provinces do matching tax cuts. The lowest personal tax rate will be reduced from 15.5% to 15%, effective January 1, 2007 back to the same level as when the Conservatives were elected in 2006. Economists said that with the large surpluses the federal government accumulated as well as high tax levels, there was another room for significant tax cuts. The opposition parties criticized the mini- budget as the NDP leader Jack Layton mentioned that the budget did little for impoverished Canadians, and that big corporations such as oil companies and major banks will receive hefty tax breaks. The Liberals were critical of the GST cut as being not an efficient tax-relief but did praise the corporate tax cuts. The mini-budget, a confidence motion did pass 127‚Äì76 but without support of any opposition party as the Liberals abstained from voting as they did with the Fall 2007 Throne Speech. During the Throne Speech in October 2007, Harper also addressed issues surrounding the economy because of difficulties in the manufacturing and forest sectors due to the loss of numerous jobs at several companies including the three major automakers in the United States and several small to large forest companies over the past few years. On January 10, 2008, the government announced a $1 billion relief fund for single- industry communities that were hit hard by recent closures particularly in the forest and manufacturing industries but also the fishing sector.

From 1998 to 2000, Naughton served as Commander, Carrier Group FOUR/Carrier Striking Force where he trained all deploying battle groups (over 100,000 sailors and marines) within the Atlantic area of responsibility and ensured all commanders were fully prepared for any contingency, had maintenance support, supply infrastructure and the proper skills to fight and win around the world. He was responsible for coordinating installations and testing with Sea, Air and Space Systems Commands to ensure configuration control and supply support for every aircraft and ship that deployed. His innovative approach completely changed and streamlined the training process increasing readiness while reducing costs. From 2000 to 2002, he served as Commander, Naval Strike & Air Warfare Center, Naval Air Station Fallon, NV, where he led a team in developing significant skills to fly high performance aircraft in the most difficult environment. He consolidated eleven advanced training organizations, brought online a unique reach back command and control system for deployed war fighters at a fraction of original cost estimates, and trained every deploying Battle Group /Airwing team that served in Afghanistan and Iraq. These initiatives reduced cost and significantly improved readiness. Naughton's last assignment in the Navy was as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy, an organization of over 4,000 midshipmen and 3,000 support staff with an annual budget responsibility of $220 million. He was relieved of duty after assaulting an enlisted Marine gate guard returning to the Academy following a New Year's Eve party in his first year.

They were made in attempt to market the popular concept of troll dolls to young boys in the early 1990s. Overview Introduced in 1992 at $4.99 to $6.99, the trolls were marketed with the slogan ‚ÄúBig Haired Dudes with Bad Attitudes‚Äù and were actually quite large at approximately 4 3/4 inches tall (not including roughly 4 inches of hair). The line did not establish a story arc to provide a unifying narrative for the characters as a group. However each individual troll was provided a brief biographical profile (in parody of a G.I. Joe file card), and, details on their cardbacks as how to properly \\"neglect\\" them suggested that the owner hide them in \\"a dark, smelly place\\" and keep them \\"cranky, mean and ready to fight anything or anyone for years!\\". In association with their tough nature, many of them had facial stitches and their toes poking through their boots. The line featured 26 individual characters, two of which were repaints available in special \\"vehicle sets\\". Each Troll featured a single cut joint at the waist and included two handheld accessories. All but four had an accessory designed to launch a projectile by flicking with the finger. The individual characters were styled on either generic action/adventure themes (a pirate, a ninja, two Vikings, a robot, a policeman, a knight, a punk rocker, and a Wild West outlaw); athletes (an American football player, an ice hockey player, a boxer, and a skateboarder); military servicemen (a general, a navy diver, and an air force pilot); monsters (a vampire, Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, and two cyclopes); or outright spoofs of famous franchises (John Rambo, the Terminator cyborg, Superman, a Mad Max-style villain, and The Ultimate Warrior). While initially successful, the Battle Trolls line failed to achieve the popular success that the 'original' troll toys enjoyed. Though much of the line consisted of references to classic fiction and popular culture, it was retired in 1993 after a third, much scarcer run with 8 final characters. A fourth series was planned, but never produced. The prototypes were displayed at the 1993 New York Toy Fair. This featured a line of six villains called the Evil Horde, including trolls styled after the Joker, Swamp Thing, an Alien, and one that looked like a hooded executioner.

Procedure Pharmaceutical publication planning involves developing a detailed plan that outlines the timely presentation of verified scientific and clinical data to appropriate types of healthcare professionals such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, as a drug undergoes clinical trials and after it is marketed. Because of scientific and therapeutic advances, pharmaceutical publication planning has become a well- established and important function by pharmaceutical companies in order to educate healthcare professionals accordingly about new drugs and marketed drugs with new clinical uses or safety information. Within pharmaceutical companies, publication planning is usually overseen by medical or clinical affairs professionals. In this effort, pharmaceutical companies frequently use the assistance of medical communication agencies with publication planning expertise and professional medical writers. Medical communication agencies Medical communication agencies include a broad range of organizations, including those that focus largely or exclusively on publication planning. When developing and executing a publication plan on behalf of a pharmaceutical or biotechnology client, medical communication agencies employ professional publication strategists, scientific medical directors, medical writers and project managers. Working as a team, this group of individuals delves deep into their client's scientific discoveries, and propose the most effective and efficient ways to spread the word about new potential therapies to physicians and other healthcare providers. There has been some discussion in the media regarding disclosure as it pertains to the use of professional medical writers in this endeavor. Some agencies and professional organizations focused on publication planning have been and continue to develop and refine ethical guidelines and standards for disclosure and transparency.  Professional publication planning associations  Professional organizations for individuals involved in pharmaceutical publication planning include the International Society of Medical Publication Professionals (ISMPP) and The International Publication Planning Association (TIPPA). The purpose of these organizations is to create a forum where individuals involved with pharmaceutical publication planning and biomedical publications can meet and share knowledge and experience. They serve to promote career opportunities and professional development of individuals involved with pharmaceutical publication planning, as well as to promote standards of excellence in ethical professional medical writing and the biomedical publication process in disseminating scientific and clinical data on pharmaceutical products. In 2009, ISMPP began a certification program for publication planning professionals.

As with ocean surfing, ideal wave conditions are when the wind switches offshore. However, when this occurs over a lake the waves generated by previous onshore wind subside relatively quick. This means lake surfers have a shorter window of opportunity to surf ideal waves. Lake surfers are often out during and experiencing the same storm that creates the waves whereas ocean surfers are more often surfing on swell produced by storms hundreds of miles away and that may have taken days to reach shore. In addition to making it more difficult to manage surfboards, high winds can make the face of a wave and water surface rough. Increased wave frequency due to shorter fetch results in less rest between waves and sets of waves. This can make it necessary to paddle out through waves because there may not be a long enough pause between sets to paddle out between them. Though not significant enough to necessitate surfboard design changes, the reduced buoyancy of fresh water results in increased drag when paddling. Lake surfers enjoy water that is fresh (\\"sweet\\" as opposed to salty) and do not have to worry about the dangers from marine life (e.g. sharks, jellyfish, etc.) that ocean surfers may have to contend with. Lakes where surfing is possible include the Great Lakes on the United States‚ÄìCanada border and Lake Tahoe on the California‚ÄìNevada border.  Great Lakes  Wave lines in Lake Michigan Winter waves in Lake Michigan Strong storms, particularly in the winter and fall (at which time they may be referred to as a November Witch), can produce large waves on the Great Lakes in North America. During these surf seasons, there is often snow, shelf ice, and some ice in the water, making access difficult and conditions more dangerous. Dedicated surfers wear wetsuits or drysuits to keep warm. The surface water temperature when much Great Lakes surfing occurs averages between . Sheboygan, Wisconsin, featured in surf films and referred to as the Malibu of the Midwest, hosted an annual Dairyland Surf Classic on Labor Day weekend from 1988 to 2012, which was the largest lake surfing competition in the world. Great Lakes surfing has grown in popularity over the past decade thanks to the advances in wetsuit and or drysuits technology and the proliferation of information on the internet. There are small surf communities all around the Great Lakes, and medium-sized communities in larger cities such as Toronto and Chicago. Local community organizations such as Surfrider Foundation Milwaukee and Surf the Greats are intended to nurture these communities, protect shorelines, and to raise awareness of Great Lakes surfing.

Mainly a central defender, he could also operate as a right back. He started and ended his 16-year professional career with Real Uni√≥n, but played mainly for Levante (eight seasons and 226 official matches, 61 in La Liga). Club career Descarga was born in Irun, Basque Country. After an insignificant stint with CA Osasuna in the second division and a season with neighbours SD Eibar in the same level, he spent eight years with Levante UD, where he would be one of their most influential players as well as captain, helping to two promotions to La Liga. His first match in the competition came on 13 November 2004 in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Deportivo de La Coru√±a, with the Valencian Community side being relegated on the last matchday. Following Levante's severe financial crisis during 2007‚Äì08, Descarga was one of many players who would leave, joining Legia Warsaw in August 2008 and reuniting with former Osasuna teammate I√±aki Astiz. He made his Ekstraklasa debut in a game against Arka Gdynia (2‚Äì2) but, after just 13 minutes on the pitch, he tore his hamstring and never played for the team again, leaving at the end of the campaign. In July 2009, Descarga signed with his first club Real Uni√≥n of Irun, recently promoted to the second tier.

It is the earliest feature film of Hong Kong cinema. It was the only film made by the Huamei (Chinese-American) Studio, which was co-founded by Benjamin Brosky, who had sold his Asia Film Company in Shanghai, and Li Minwei. The film was, however, never screened in Hong Kong. Brosky brought the film to the United States, and it became the first Chinese film to be shown abroad, when it was exhibited in the Chinese communities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. It is based on the zidishu play \\"The Butterfly Dream\\" written by Chunshuzhai. Cast Li Minwei stars as the wife of Zhuangzi, while Li Minwei's wife Yan Shanshan plays a servant girl, thus making her the first ever Chinese film actress. *Li Beihai ... Zhuangzi *Li Minwei ... Zhuangzi's wife *Yan Shanshan ... Servant Girl Background Zhuangzi was one of the two defining figures of Chinese Taoism, based his philosophy that all things change and that the perception of truth depends on the context under which it exists. Throughout history, his teachings have been particularly favored by Chinese scholars and artists, many of whom have been inspired by Zhuangzi's philosophy. In other media Zhuangzi Tests His Wife has been performed by the Peking Opera, and other local stage performances. Zhuangzi Most of the operatic versions of the story ends with Zhuangzi burying his wife after she commits suicide for being disloyal to her husband. But this version tackles the story from a different angle. While Tian Shi still commits suicide in the end, Zhuangzi turns her and himself into butterflies and then, eventually, into dust.

She \\"started taking piano lessons around the age of four, and when she was seven, her family moved to Roosevelt, a black community outside Dallas. Myers took piano and violin lessons, but eventually, partly for financial reasons, settled on the piano, taking weekly lessons of fifteen minutes each.\\" She began to learn some European classical music at high school, but this was interrupted when she and the family moved back to Blackwell. Myers majored in music education at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas. In her second year, she was invited to play at The Safari Room in Memphis, Tennessee. This engagement, however, was very brief, as her musical repertoire was too limited. After graduation, she moved in 1963 to Chicago, where she taught music at an elementary school. She also attended classes at Roosevelt University and worked with musicians such as Sonny Stitt and Gene Ammons. She was one of the performers at the AACM's second concert. In the late 1960s, Myers added \\"Amina\\" to her name. In 1976 Myers relocated to New York City,\\"Full length Bio: Amina Claudine Myers\\", Company of Heaven. where she intensified her compositional work and expanded it into the realm of Off-Broadway productions.

The second definition is equivalent to the economic rent of the land plus interest on capital improvements plus depreciation and maintenance‚Äîthe normal market rent of a property‚Äîand is not inherently excessive. Also, this may be different from the rent actually being received. Historically, rack-rent has often been a term of protest used to denote an unjustly excessive rent (the word \\"rack\\" evoking the medieval torture device), usually one paid by a tenant farmer. The two conceptions of rack-rent both apply when excessive rent is obtained by threat of eviction resulting in uncompensated dispossession of improvements the tenant himself has made. I.e., by charging rack-rent, the landowner unjustly uses his power over the land to effectively confiscate wages, in addition to merely charging the tenant interest and depreciation on the capital improvements which the landlord himself has made to the land.Michael Edward Turner, John Vincent Beckett, and Bethanie Afton, Agricultural rent in England, 1690-1914 (Cambridge University Press, 2004). When there is no accessible rent-free land, any improvements in the condition of society, be they in the form of civilizational progress or local improvement, are recaptured in the form of higher land values, and the leftover wages after rent is paid will tend towards subsistence, as described by David Ricardo's Law of Rent. Such rents can be described as rack-rent, and this sense of the term is economically meaningful, and distinct from other forms of rent. In Ulster in the 1700s, \\"... landlords were able to 'auction off' leases to the highest bidders. That practice, known as 'rack renting', forced renters to bid more than they could afford to pay.\\" H. Tyler Blethen and Curtis W.

The line, which operated between 1959 and 2017, ran from Canton, Baltimore to the Mondawmin Metro Subway Station, serving the communities of Butcher's Hill, Little Italy, and Sandtown-Winchester. History The bus route is the successor to the 18 Canton, 18 Pennsylvania Avenue, and Hudson Street streetcar lines; the Pennsylvania Avenue Line was the second streetcar line in Baltimore. Between 1893 and 1931, the Route 7 designation was used for a streetcar that operated between Govanstown and Irvington as a short-turn version of the No. 8 Streetcar. The no. 7 designation was not given to this route until 1959, when it was combined with the Reisterstown Road bus, which at that time had that designation. The Baltimore City Passenger Railway opened a line along Baltimore Street, Greene Street, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Cumberland Street to Boundary Avenue (now North Avenue) on August 24, 1859. The line was later extended along North Avenue, McCulloh Street, and Cloverdale Road to Madison Avenue, and through-routed to Canton (via Baltimore Street, Broadway, Bank Street, and other streets) as the Green Line.Clayton Coleman Hall, Baltimore: Its History and Its People vol. 1, Lewis Historical Publishing Company (1912), pp. 279, 545-551 The line was electrified in 1894 and numbered Route 18 in 1899. Bus Route L began serving Reisterstown Road to Pikesville on July 3, 1929. On June 27, 1948, it was combined with Route 5 as Route 5/7; Route 7 trips were extended downtown along Druid Hill Avenue, where Route 5 had run as a streetcar line until then. Route 18 was replaced by buses on June 8, 1952, and on September 6, 1959 it was absorbed into Route 7, which was shifted from Druid Hill Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue. Soon after the Metro Subway opened, Route 7 was truncated on June 18, 1984 to its current terminal at Mondawmin station during the subway's operating hours. One new route - Route M-2 - was formed beyond Mondawmin, along Reisterstown Road to Old Court Road at Pikesville. It was extended to the Old Court Metro Subway Station on August 31, 1987, soon after that station opened. Route 7 was truncated full-time to Mondawmin in 2001, when subway and Route M-2 hours were extended. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, MTA planned to eliminate Route 7 completely and require riders to walk a few blocks to other nearby routes. Due to public outcry, this line remained intact. In future proposed phases of GBBI, plans were in place to reduce the frequency or change the routing of Route 7, but no such changes were made. On June 18, 2017 as part of the BaltimoreLink transit overhaul Route 7 will be divided into multiple routes. CityLink Lime will take over the upper part of the Pennsylvania Avenue section of Route 7, LocalLink 65 will take over the Pratt and Lombard Streets to Canton part of Route 7, and LocalLink 73 will take over the lower part of Pennsylvania Avenue to Paca and Greene Streets part of Route 7. Rosewood service Between 1970 and 2000, a special service using the no. 7 (or 7X) designation operated for the employees of Rosewood Center in Owings Mills. The service has started to replace Route H service operated by experimental Job Express Transit in 1969. Rosewood trips shared parts of the regular route of Route 7, including some parts in which limited stops were made, hence an express designation. In 1997, a new Route M-17 was formed. Route M-17 started as a replacement for special branches of Routes M-9 and M-16, which were combined at the time. The initial proposal was for the 7 Rosewood branch to be discontinued except on Sundays, and the new Route M-17 to serve Rosewood on weekdays and Saturdays.MTA Summer 1996 hearings brochure But public outcry resulted in the 7 Rosewood service being retained. When Route M-17 was first introduced in 1997, it did not serve Rosewood at all, and simply operated between the Business Center at Owings Mills and the Owings Mills Corporate Campus. But a year later, Route M-17 was modified to serve Rosewood as well as the T. Rowe Price Owings Mills campus.MTA February 1998 schedule changes Later in 1998, Route M-17 had another addition in which service to the ADP building on Red Run Boulevard, providing service to other office buildings that would eventually be built along Red Run. Midday service to Red Run existed briefly in 1999, but was discontinued due to low ridership. In 2001, the 7 Rosewood service was redesignated Route 102. Routing was also modified to serve the Owings Mills Metro Subway Station. The name change was not free of controversy. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, Route 102 was discontinued. Low ridership and a heavy burden on taxpayers was cited as the reason. Additional trips were added on Route M-17 to accommodate riders of Route 102, including late night and weekend service.Owings Mills Times Other parts of Route M-17 that had low ridership were also discontinued, including those to the Owings Mills Corporate Campus and T. Rowe Price.Owings Mills Times On August 30, 2009, following the closure of Rosewood, Route M-17 was discontinued and the Red Run Portion was absorbed by the 59. No replacement was made for any service north of Reisterstown Road.http://mtamaryland.com/services/bus/routes/bus/schedule_changes/ Red Land Court part of the route was absorbed by the 59 In popular culture *The no. 7 bus is found in the novel Woodholme By DeWayne Wickham.

Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on data and statistical methods. In contrast, business intelligence traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods. Business analytics makes extensive use of analytical modeling and numerical analysis, including explanatory and predictive modeling, and fact-based management to drive decision making. It is therefore closely related to management science. Analytics may be used as input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. Business intelligence is querying, reporting, online analytical processing (OLAP), and \\"alerts.\\" In other words, querying, reporting, OLAP, it is alert tools can answer questions such as what happened, how many, how often, where the problem is, and what actions are needed. Business analytics can answer questions like why is this happening, what if these trends continue, what will happen next (predict), and what is the best outcome that can happen (optimize). Examples of application In healthcare, business analysis can be used to operate and manage clinical information systems. It can transform medical data from a bewildering array of analytical methods into useful information. Data analysis can also be used to generate contemporary reporting systems which include the patient's latest key indicators, historical trends and reference values. Types of analytics * Decision analytics: supports human decisions with visual analytics that the user models to reflect reasoning. * Descriptive analytics: gains insight from historical data with reporting, scorecards, clustering etc. * Predictive analytics: employs predictive modelling using statistical and machine learning techniques * Prescriptive analytics: recommends decisions using optimization, simulation, etc. Basic domains within analytics * Behavioral analytics * Cohort analysis * Competitor analysis * Cyber analytics * Enterprise optimization * Financial services analytics * Fraud analytics * Health care analytics * Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) * Marketing analytics * Pricing analytics * Retail sales analytics * Risk & Credit analytics * Supply chain analytics * Talent analytics * Telecommunications * Transportation analytics * Customer Journey Analytics * Market Basket Analysis History Analytics have been used in business since the management exercises were put into place by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century. Henry Ford measured the time of each component in his newly established assembly line. But analytics began to command more attention in the late 1960s when computers were used in decision support systems. Since then, analytics have changed and formed with the development of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, data warehouses, and a large number of other software tools and processes. In later years the business analytics have exploded with the introduction to computers. This change has brought analytics to a whole new level and has brought about endless possibilities. As far as analytics has come in history, and what the current field of analytics is today, many people would never think that analytics started in the early 1900s with Mr. Ford himself. Challenges Business analytics depends on sufficient volumes of high quality data. The difficulty in ensuring data quality is integrating and reconciling data across different systems, and then deciding what subsets of data to make available. Previously, analytics was considered a type of after-the-fact method of forecasting consumer behavior by examining the number of units sold in the last quarter or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions. When a specific customer type is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time. Competing on analytics Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that businesses can optimize a distinct business capability via analytics and thus better compete. He identifies these characteristics of an organization that are apt to compete on analytics: * One or more senior executives who strongly advocate fact-based decision making and, specifically, analytics * Widespread use of not only descriptive statistics, but also predictive modeling and complex optimization techniques * Substantial use of analytics across multiple business functions or processes * Movement toward an enterprise level approach to managing analytical tools, data, and organizational skills and capabilities See also * Business analysis * Business analyst * Business process discovery * Customer dynamics * Test and learn ReferencesFurther reading * Category:Business terms Category:Data warehousing Category:Applied data mining Category:Business intelligence Category:Management science analytics de:Business Analytics ","title":"Business analytics"},{"id":"10147385","text":"Robertine Barry. Robertine Barry was a member of the first presidential board, of the F√©d√©ration nationale Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Montr√©al, 1907. Robertine Barry (26 February 1863 ‚Äì 7 January 1910), pseudonym Fran√ßoise, was an early French Canadian journalist and publisher and a popular member of Montreal society.  Early life  Robertine Barry was born in L‚Äô√éle-Verte, Lower Canada to John Edmond Barry and Agla√©e Rouleau. The couple had thirteen children. John Edmond Barry eventually rose to local political prominence. Agla√©e Rouleau was a native of L‚Äô√éle-Verte. Barry attended elementary school in Les Escoumins from 1868 to 1873, and was a day student at the Couvent J√©sus-Marie in Trois-Pistoles. From September 1880 to July 1882 she wrote for the student newspaper while at boarding school in Quebec. Barry often fight stifled by the rules of convent education and was often reprimanded for bad behavior. Barry graduated at age 20. Barry was not interested in marriage. As she explained, \\"I am not among those who consider marriage as the goal to which must be devoted a lifetime of noble efforts.\\"  Career  Inspired by the success of French journalist S√©verine, Barry set her sights on a career as a journalist. In 1891, Barry published her first pieces for La Patrie of Montreal under the pen name Fran√ßoise. The name honored Saint Francis de Sales and indirectly honored Barry's sister Evelyn who had taken holy orders on the feast day of Francis de Sales. Barry's first article was on the importance of female education and it challenged the Catholic Church's control over schools. The article set off a firestorm. Honor√© Beaugrand was her editor. From September 21, 1891 to March 5, 1900, Barry wrote a weekly column for La Patrie under her pen name. Barry was the first hired to work full-time by a Quebec newspaper. During the summer of 1895, Barry vacationed in Halifax and spotted the bell of the Fortress of Louisbourg in a local pharmacy. Barry used her column in La Patrie to organize a successful fundraising campaign to buy the bell. The bell is currently displayed at the Chateau de Ramezay. Barry published Le Journal de Fran√ßoise, a bimonthly review from 1902 to 1909. The magazine, subtitled \\"Le Gazette canadienne de la famille\\", offered a wide variety of features intended primarily for women. The magazine also reflected Barry's interest in literature, publishing works of distinguished Quebec writers such as Laure Conan, Juliette Adam, Marie G√©rin-Lajoie, Louis Fr√©chette and √âmile Nelligan. Many female journalists in Quebec got their first break writing for Le Journal de Fran√ßoise.

Function  Nibrin is a protein associated with the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) which pose serious damage to a genome. It is a 754 amino acid protein identified as a member of the NBS1/hMre11/RAD50(N/M/R, more commonly referred to as MRN) double strand DNA break repair complex. This complex recognizes DNA damage and rapidly relocates to DSB sites and forms nuclear foci. It also has a role in regulation of N/M/R (MRN) protein complex activity which includes end-processing of both physiological and mutagenic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).  Cellular response to DSBs  Cellular response is performed by damage sensors, effectors of lesion repair and signal transduction. The central role is carried out by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) by activating the DSB signaling cascade, phosphorylating downstream substrates such as histone H2AX and NBS1. NBS1 relocates to DSB sites by interaction of FHA/BRCT domains with phosphorylated histone H2AX. Once it interacts with nibrin c-terminal hMre11-binding domain, hMre11 and hRad50 relocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus then to sites of DSBs. They finally relocate to N/M/R where they form the foci at the site of damage.  Double strand breaks (DSBs)  DSBs occur during V(D)J recombination during early B and T cell development. This is at the point when the cells of the immune system are developing and the DSBs affect the development of lymphoid cells. DSBs also occur in immunoglobulin class switch in mature B cells. More frequently, however, DSBs are caused by mutagenic agents like radiomimetic chemicals and ionizing radiation(IR).  DSB mutations  As mentioned, DSBs cause extreme damage to DNA. Mutations that cause defective repair of DSBs tend to accumulate un-repaired DSBs. One such mutation is associated with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), a radiation hyper-sensitive disease. It is a rare inherited autosomal recessive condition of chrosomal instability. It has been linked to mutations within exons 6-10 in the NBS1 gene which results in a truncated protein. Characteristics of NBS include microcephaly, cranial characteristics, growth retardation, impaired sexual maturation, immunodeficiency/recurring infections and a predisposition to cancer. This predisposition to cancer may be linked to the DSBs occurring at the development of lymphoid cells. Fertility Two adult siblings, both heterozygous for two particular NBS1 nonsense mutations displayed cellular sensitivity to radiation, chromosome instability and fertility defects, but not the developmental defects that are typically found in other NBS patients. These individuals appear to be primarily defective in homologous recombination, a process that accurately repairs double-strand breaks, both in somatic cells and during meiosis. Orthologs of NBS1 have been studied in mice and the plant arabidopsis. NBS1 mutant mice display cellular radiation sensitivity and female mice are sterile due to oogenesis failure. Studies of NBS1 mutants in Arabidopsis revealed that NBS1 has a role in recombination during early stages of meiosis. NBS1 over-expression in cancer NBS1 has a role in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) repair of double strand breaks. It is one of 6 enzymes required for this error prone DNA repair pathway. NBS1 is often over-expressed in prostate cancer, in liver cancer, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, in non-small cell lung carcinoma, hepatoma, and esophageal cancer, in head and neck cancer, and in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Cancers are very often deficient in expression of one or more DNA repair genes, but over-expression of a DNA repair gene is less usual in cancer. For instance, at least 36 DNA repair enzymes, when mutationally defective in germ line cells, cause increased risk of cancer (hereditary cancer syndromes). (Also see DNA repair-deficiency disorder.) Similarly, at least 12 DNA repair genes have frequently been found to be epigenetically repressed in one or more cancers. (See also Epigenetically reduced DNA repair and cancer.) Ordinarily, deficient expression of a DNA repair enzyme results in increased un-repaired DNA damages which, through replication errors (translesion synthesis), lead to mutations and cancer. However, NBS1 mediated MMEJ repair is highly inaccurate, so in this case, over-expression, rather than under-expression, apparently leads to cancer.  Herpes virus  HSV-1 infects more than 90% of adults over the age of 50. Alphaherpesviruses alone can cause the host to have mild symptoms, but these viruses can be associated with severe disease when they are transferred to a new species. Humans can even pass and also get an HSV-1 infection from other primate species. However, because of evolutionary differences between primate species, only some species can pass HSV-1 in an interspecies interaction. Also, though HSV-1 transmission from humans to other species primates can occur, there is no known sustained transmission chains that have resulted from constant transmission. A study found that Nbs1 is the most diverged in DNA sequence in the MRN complex between different primate species and that there is a high degree of species specificity, causing variability in promotion of the HSV-1 life cycle. The same study found that Nbs1 interacts with HSV-1's ICP0 proteins in an area of structural disorder of the nibrin. This suggests that in general, viruses commonly interact in intrinsically disordered domains in host proteins. It is possible that there are differences in the mammalian genomes that create unique environments for the viruses. Host proteins that are specific to the species might determine how the viruses must adapt to be able to ignite an infection in a new species. The evolution of increased disorder in nibrin benefits the host in decreasing ICP0 interaction and virus hijack. Nbs1 may not be the only host protein that evolves this way.Dianne I. Lou, Eui Tae Kim, Nicholas R. Meyerson, Neha J. Pancholi, Kareem N. Mohni, David Enard, Dmitri A. Petrov, Sandra K. Weller, Matthew D. Weitzman, Sara L. Sawyer (August 2016). ‚ÄúAn Intrinsically Disordered Region of the DNA Repair Protein Nbs1 Is a Species-Specific Barrier to Herpes Simplex Virus 1 in Primates.‚Äù Cell Host and Microbe. 20 (2): 179-88. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.07.003 HSV-1-infection has been shown to result from the phosphorylation of Nbs1. It has been shown in studies that activation of the MRN complex and ATM biochemical cascade is consistent for a resulting HSV-1 infection. When there is an HSV-1 infection, the nucleus is reorganized causing the formation of RCs (replication compartments) where gene expression and DNA replication occurs. Proteins in the host used for DNA repair and damage response are needed for virus production. ICP8, which is a viral single-strand binding protein, is known to interact with several DNA repair proteins, such as Rad50, Mre11, BRG1, and DNA-PKcs. Ul12 and ICP8 viral proteins function together as a recombinase, possibly showing that while working with the host's recombination factors, work to form a concatemer by stimulating homologous recombination. These proteins may move the MRN complex towards the viral genome so it is able to promote homologous recombination, and to prevent non-homologous recombination as non-homologous recombination can have anti-viral effects. This possibly shows that the reaction between UL12 and MRN regulates the complex in a way that benefits the herpes virus.Nandakumar Balasubramanian, Ping Bai, Gregory Buchek, George Korza and Sandra K.

This protocol is used by numerous manufacturers of network equipment and software who are developing simplified means of handling certificates for large-scale implementation to everyday users, as well as being referenced in other industry standards. The protocol is designed to make the issuing of digital certificates as scalable as possible. The idea is that any standard network user should be able to request their digital certificate electronically and as simply as possible. These processes have usually required intensive input from network administrators, and so have not been suited to large-scale deployments. The Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol is the most popular, widely available, and tested certificate enrollment protocol. it is widely used, for example by the Cisco IOS operating system (even if Cisco is now pushing the more fully feature EST) and iPhones to enroll in enterprises PKI. Most PKI software (specifically the RA) supports it, including the Network Device Enrollment Service of Active Directory Certificate Service.  History  After being effectively abandoned by its original Cisco sponsors around 2010, already ten years in the standardization process, when they started pushing for EST instead, the Internet Draft describing the protocol was revived in 2015 by Peter Gutmann due to its widespread use in industry and in other standards, updating the algorithms used and correcting numerous issues in the original specification, which had accumulated a considerable amount of detritus over time.

The space has been redeveloped as part of the larger CityScape office and retail project; large portions of the park were demolished as of the spring of 2009. Before the CityScape project broke ground in the fall of 2007, Patriots Square Park was a 2.5 acre (1 hectare) mixed-use park containing open space, an outdoor performing arts stage, and food concessions. The park also served as a decorative cover for a public parking structure located underground which still remains and is in use. Patriots Square Park was the location of a number of community celebrations such as the Arizona Asian Festival and Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The park is also listed as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride. It was originally constructed in 1976 and named in honor of the fighters of the American Revolutionary War, and redesigned in 1988 by Alexander and Associates, including the parking structure. In the years between then and the CityScape project, the space fell into slight disrepair and was frequented by transients. Redevelopment Often maligned as being underused and forgotten, Patriots Square Park became a fixture in local news in 2006 when RED Development's ambitious CityScape plan was expanded to include the park, approved by the Phoenix city council. The CityScape project is a large-scale urban redevelopment project that includes retail, hotels and high-rise construction. Initial reports of the park being subsumed into the private project were met with sharp criticism, with angry residents raising objections over the city's actions. In spite of official statements claiming the plan was key to revitalizing the park, residents rallied against the perceived loss of park-space, and forced RED Development and the city to redraw the plans, unveiled at a public forum. Reaction to the redesign, while viewed as a minor victory by some opponents, was still largely negative. The park officially re- opened on November 4, 2010, with a free concert over two days headlined by Macy Gray and Third Eye Blind.

Founded in 1950, the NATA has grown to more than 43,000 members worldwide. The majority of certified athletic trainers choose to be members of NATA to support their profession and to receive a broad array of membership benefits.  History  The NATA was unofficially formed in late 1949 by a small group of athletic trainers from around the nation. The NATA was founded in 1950 when the first meeting of the NATA took place in Kansas City, Missouri. Nearly 200 athletic trainers gathered to discuss the future of their profession. Recognizing the need for a set of professional standards and appropriate professional recognition, the NATA has helped to unify certified athletic trainers across the country by setting a standard for professionalism, education, certification, research and practice settings. Since its inception, the NATA has been a driving force behind the recognition of the athletic training profession. Once housed in Greenville, North Carolina, the NATA is now headquartered in Dallas, Texas. From humble beginnings, the association has expanded to encompass a global membership totaling more than 43,000, plus a full-time executive director and staff. Members serve as leaders for the association, which has multiple committees working together to help advance the profession. In 2016 at their national convention in Baltimore the National Athletic Trainers' Association announced the launch of its first-ever public awareness campaign, At Your Own Risk. The campaign is designed to educate, provide resources and equip the public (non- athletic trainers) to act and advocate for safety in work, life and sport.

In 1976, the quartet made their final change of residency and moved to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.CLEVELAND QUARTET - The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History The quartet had three personnel changes: violist Atar Arad replaced Strongin Katz in 1980; violist James Dunham then replaced Arad in 1987; and William Preucil replaced Weilerstein as first violin in 1989. The quartet disbanded in 1995. Preucil became concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, a position he held until 2018, when he was fired for sexual misconduct.

Marryott saw duty in Vietnam and flew numerous Cold War missions. He went on to command Patrol Squadron 9 and the Naval Air Station, Moffett Field, California He served as a Navy aviator and commanded the Iceland Defense Force. He also served seven tours in the Pentagon and was President of the Naval War College from 1985 to 1986. Superintendent One of his greatest challenges as the academy's superintendent was to stanch the dropout rate for female midshipmen. He appointed a task force to examine the reasons for the high attrition rate in the 1980s, where he found that much of the problem was female recruits often lacked strong backgrounds in sciences or athletics, two staples of life at the academy. Once recruiters started looking for women who were strong in these areas, as were their male counterparts, the attrition rate dropped.

Written by Joe Pokaski and directed by Paul Edwards, the episode aired on NBC in the United States on April 30, 2007. It is the last episode before the three-part finale of season one. This episode was originally known as \\"String Theory\\". The title was changed to \\"Five Years Gone\\", and \\"String Theory\\" was used as the title of Chapter 30 in the graphic novels.TV Recap: Heroes - Chapter 20 - Five Years Gone Plot This episode focuses on Hiro Nakamura and Ando Masahashi travelling five years into the future, showing where the world will be if the explosion isn't stopped. Future Hiro, last encountered in the episode \\"Hiros\\", is featured more prominently, this time as the world's most wanted terrorist and a master of Batt≈çjutsu. Ando was killed in the blast, which according to Peter, is the reason why Hiro lost his humorous side and became obsessed with changing the past. Nathan Petrelli is now the President of the United States, with Mohinder Suresh as his Chief Medical Advisor and Matt Parkman as the head of Homeland Security with the Haitian at his side. Niki Sanders has become a stripper again, adopting \\"Jessica\\", the name of both her former alter ego and sister, as her stage name. Her son Micah was killed in the explosion that destroyed much of New York. Niki has a romantic relationship with Peter Petrelli, who has a distinct scar across his face which starts on the right side of his forehead down to his left cheek. Sylar is blamed for detonating a nuclear explosion that destroys half of New York and kills millions of people, and is assumed to be deceased. In the original timeline, Hiro had stabbed him before the explosion, but Sylar had already succeeded in killing Claire Bennet at her high school Homecoming, absorbed her regenerative powers, and survived. However, this timeline was altered and did not actually occur, as Hiro had visited Peter Petrelli with the message \\"save the cheerleader, save the world\\" and, consequently, Sylar was denied the ability of spontaneous regeneration. Nonetheless, the explosion did occur and, in reality, Peter was the cause of the blast in the alternate timeline. Nathan lied to the public to protect his brother, and blamed Sylar for the explosion. Sylar was able to kill Nathan and impersonate him after killing Candice and acquiring her illusory ability. For him, the hunting and, eventually, extermination of other superpowered people is all part of his \\"eliminating the competition\\". With Sylar disguising himself as Nathan, acting as President (reminiscent of Isaac Mendez' painting), and exploiting public panic after the destruction of New York, persons with special abilities are now viewed with fear and suspicion and are subject to heavy persecution, with the Department of Homeland Security (including Parkman and the Haitian) working to hunt down \\"unregistered\\" individuals in accordance with the \\"Linderman Act\\". Mr. Bennet and Hana Gitelman work to hide heroes and their families, giving them new identities and moving them to keep them safe. Mr. Bennet has made a secret bargain with Parkman, however, to turn over individuals with \\"dangerous\\" powers, while Parkman allows Mr. Bennet to continue helping others with \\"harmless\\" powers, including Parkman's own son. One of the individuals Mr. Bennet is hiding is his adopted daughter Claire. She becomes a brunette and goes undercover as a waitress in Midland, Texas at the Burnt Toast Diner, the same place Charlie Andrews worked at, using her adoptive mother's name, Sandra. She is engaged to Andy (Kellan Lutz), a fellow worker at the diner. Parkman betrays Mr. Bennet after finding out that there are indeed two Hiros and one of them escaped him. Not wanting to face the President empty-handed, he extracts Claire's location from Mr. Bennet's mind, and then shoots his former ally (Hana Gitelman was also killed prior to the confrontation between Parkman and Bennet). Parkman proceeds to capture Claire, who was about to go on the run, and sends her to the Petrelli mansion in Manhattan. There Sylar, under the guise of Nathan, attacks her and once again obtains her power in this alternate timeline. Meanwhile, present-day Hiro has been captured by Parkman. When Sylar/Nathan orders Mohinder to kill Hiro to begin his plan of genocide of the super- powered, Mohinder instead kills the Haitian and allows present-day Hiro to escape. Mohinder then shows present-day Hiro a new copy of Isaac Mendez's 9th Wonders! comic book (the same copy Isaac drew before being murdered in the previous episode), where Mohinder is shown injecting the Haitian. When Peter, Future Hiro and Ando stage an attack to free present-day Hiro, Parkman calls the President to inform him that they're being repelled by Peter. Upon hearing this, Sylar, still disguised as Nathan, flies away in front of a crowd to whom he just gave a speech about the last five years, effectively revealing to them that he too is a super-powered individual. Sylar reveals himself to Peter and they prepare to battle. Peter generates fire with his hands, while Sylar surrounds his with ice. When Mohinder demands that present-day Hiro go back to the past, the less-experienced Hiro states that he doesn't know how to get back to the correct date. Before Future Hiro can take his earlier self back in time himself, he is shot in the back by Parkman. As Future Hiro dies, he gives Ando a page of Isaac's comic book. As present-day Hiro expresses his shock at seeing his own death, Mohinder pushes Future Hiro's katana into his hands and tells him to go quickly. Hiro and Ando travel back to the past and look happily upon the undestroyed city before them. Hiro looks at the comic strip of him killing Sylar and says, \\"Now, the hard part\\".

It was released for the PlayStation Portable and Wii in 2007.\\"Sega's Alien Syndrome Venturing Onto The Wii And PSP System\\" press release from Sega of America The 2007 iteration takes place a century after the previous games and introduces role-playing elements to the gameplay. Plot The story picks up approximately 100 years after the original Alien Syndrome. The title is set in the far future, where interplanetary space travel is possible. Communication is lost with one of the stations on a distant planet, the Kronos, and Aileen Harding is sent to investigate. She quickly discovers that Alien Syndrome is behind the disappearance and decides to fight the enemy and find out what happened to her boyfriend Tom. Gameplay Alien Syndrome is played as a top-down shooter, with players turning their characters the direction they would like to shoot. The game has 40 levels,Jeff Kung blog from Jeff Kung, Senior Game designer at Totally Games with 5 bosses and 15 mini-bosses. Players customize their character to expand in-game strategy options. Alien Syndrome offers up to 80 different weapons to use and hundreds of armor types as well as bonus items. Players are accompanied by a robotic drone (SCARAB) that serves as a storage space for items as well as a backup for the main character. As a constant companion, SCARAB can assist in fights and grant on-demand access to the character's cache of weapons and armors. Players have both a life meter and a constantly refilling energy meter, with the latter reflecting shield power. The game also features co-op multiplayer for up to 4 people on one screen for the Wii version. On the PSP version, the game features co-op multiplayer via a WiFi connection. On the PSP, player movement and aiming are handled with the analog stick; while a player is firing a ranged weapon, her facing is locked. On the Wii, movement is handled by the analog stick on the Nunchuk, while aiming is controlled by pointing with the Wii Remote. The Wii version of Alien Syndrome differs very slightly as it emphasizes use of the Wiimote control scheme. Tilting the Nunchuk rotates the screen to change orientation. In addition, motion control-based minigames are available to the player to increase stats via DNA augmentation chambers found in various levels, defeat lock protection on golden chests with guided nanites to procure items with a variety of attributes as well as loot, and disinfect rare items afflicted by the Alien Syndrome with charged nanites to restore their attributes. Reception On the Wii, critical reception to this game was mostly negative. Both IGN and GameSpot praised the intuitive aiming controls, but complained about the lack of enemy variety and graphical difference between the Wii and PSP versions.

It was widely believed until recently that a building subject to an explosive attack had a chance to remain standing only if it possessed some extraordinary resistive capacity. This belief rested on the assumption that the specific impulse or the time integral of pressure, which is a dominant characteristic of the blast load, is fully beyond our control. Techniques of explosion protection=Avoidance Avoidance will make it impossible for an explosion or deflagration to occur, for instance by means of suppressing the heat and the pressure needed for an explosion using aluminum mesh structure such as eXess, by means of consistent displacement of the O2 necessary for an explosion or deflagration to take place, by means of padding gas (f. i. CO2 or N2), or, by means of keeping the concentration of flammable content of an atmosphere consistently below or above the explosive limit, or, by means of consistent elimination of ignition sources. Constructional explosion protection Constructional explosion protection aims at pre- defined, limited or zero damage that results from applied protective techniques in combination with reinforcement of the equipment or structures that must be expected to become subject to internal explosion pressure and flying debris or external violent impact.Draft final reports on World Trade Center Blast mitigation Explosion protection method selection The technology of protectionExplosion Protection Techniques can range in price dramatically but where the type of device is rational to use, would typically be from least to most expensive solutions: explosion doors and vents (dependent on quantities and common denominators, either may end up the wise price choice); inerting: explosion suppression; isolation ‚Äì or combinations of same. To focus on the most cost effective, doors typically have lower release pressure capabilities; are not susceptible to fatigue failures or subject to changing release pressures with changes in temperature, as ‚Äúrupture membrane‚Äù type are; capable of leak tight service; service temperatures of up to 2,000¬∞F; and can be more cost effective in small quantities. Rupture membrane type vents can provide a leak tight seal more readily in most cases; have a relatively broad tolerance on their release pressure and are more readily incorporated into systems with discharge ducts. Discharge Hood with Explosion Relief Panels and Fracture Clip Releases.

The name is believed to derive from the Pungoteague region of Accomack County, Virginia, where the design was developed in the 1840s and 1850s. In form, the pungy is a two-masted gaff- rigged schooner with a main topsail but no square-rigged sails (as found on the related Baltimore clipper). The masts are tall and raked, and there is a bowsprit on the clipper bow. The deck is flush, with a log rail. The hull is framed and has a vee profile. One peculiar detail of the pungy is its traditional paint scheme of green and pink, the origin of which is unknown. The pungy, like the Baltimore clipper, evolved from the pilot schooner. Its principal usage was to haul freight, particularly perishables. It was capable of ocean travel and was used, for instance, to ship pineapples to Baltimore from Bermuda. It was also used for a time to dredge for oysters, but its excessive draft and large crew complement led to its being replaced by the bugeye. The last pungies were built in the 1880s, and the type's use died out in the first half of the twentieth century. A replica, the Lady Maryland, was built in 1985‚Äì1986 and continues to serve as a floating classroom for The Living Classrooms Foundation.

It is the first episode of the three-part finale for season one. The title is a reference to Hiro's last line of the previous episode, \\"Now the hard part.\\" It is the first line in this episode as well. Plot On the eve of the election, events continue to draw the characters to New York City. In Isaac Mendez's loft, Sylar continues to paint. Looking at the results, he sees a painting of a confrontation between himself and Ted Sprague, and another of a nuclear explosion in New York. Realizing that he may be the cause of the explosion, Sylar calls Mohinder Suresh asking for his help, saying that he does not want to kill innocent people, and that he only took powers from people who \\"didn't deserve them\\" - but then hangs up after he hears Mohinder dialing '911' on his cell phone. Sylar then calls his mother, Virginia Gray (Ellen Greene), and asks if he can come see her. Mohinder meets with Thompson, who again attempts to convince him to join forces. Mohinder is reluctant, saying that they are all thugs. Thompson persists, introducing Mohinder to Molly Walker, a young girl with the ability to see and locate individuals no matter where they may be. However, she cannot use this ability due to a very rare disease which Mohinder's sister, Shanti, died of. Upon their return from the future, Hiro and Ando return to Isaac's loft to question the artist about dialogue from an unfinished comic that depicts Hiro slaying Sylar and halting the explosion. They find Isaac's corpse, and realize that someone is in the loft's bathroom. Hiro and Ando hide behind a canvas, only to see Sylar preparing for his visit with his mother. Sylar hears the pair, but they teleport away before Sylar can reveal them. Hiro and Ando reappear in a convenience store. They walk onto the street just in time to see Sylar walk past. Ando convinces Hiro to follow him, hoping to find him unprepared for an attack. Claire watches as her father, Nathan Petrelli, greets his wife and sons upon their return to the Petrelli mansion; however, he does not introduce her to them, seeing as they still don't know. She shares a glance and a shy smile with Peter, who is drawing in a sketchbook. His drawings include scenes of Petrelli campaign posters surrounded by nuclear devastation. Jessica and D.L. argue about their son Micah's whereabouts, and D.L. blames Jessica for his disappearance. He leaves, intending to rescue Micah without help. Niki pleads with Jessica to assist him, saying that he will die without her help. Micah, meanwhile, is seen playing video games in a spacious apartment, while Candice speaks to Linderman on the phone. She then appears as Niki, and checks in on Micah. He tells her that he doesn't want to be here, that he wants to go home, and that he does not like Mr. Linderman. Candice (as Niki) chastises him, saying that Linderman had helped them, and that it was now time to return the favor. Angela Petrelli helps Claire pack for their trip to Paris, but leaves when Peter comes to speak with Claire. Peter attempts to talk Claire into staying, showing her his drawings of the explosion and its aftermath. One drawing shows a man unharmed by the explosion, and Claire remarks that it looks like Ted. Peter asks about Ted. Sylar arrives at his mother's home in Queens, with Hiro and Ando following a short distance behind. Sylar gives his mother a snow globe from Texas, and then proceeds to begin repairs on one of his father's clocks. His mother attempts to talk him into getting a job in the financial sector, which prompts Sylar to note that he has a job. His mother states that, if he wished, he could be \\"so special\\", maybe even becoming president. Sylar tells his mother that he is already special, and picks up a sink hose to demonstrate. Sylar turns the spray into snow, which falls much like a snow globe. Sylar then lifts one snow globe and begins to float it around his mother, then another, and then another. His mother is excited and amazed at first, but upon seeing Sylar's face while he manipulates several snow globes, she becomes frightened, and one of the globes strikes her in the face. Peter and Claire confront Nathan about Ted. With someone else having the ability to explode, Peter is hopeful that the explosion can be stopped. Nathan is doubtful, and points out that Peter's vision was of his own explosion. Peter responds that he had a vision of flying as well, despite the fact that it was Nathan who could fly - a fact that impresses Claire. After Peter and Claire leave, Nathan makes a phone call to Mr. Linderman saying \\"We have a problem.\\" DL and Jessica phase through walls and into Linderman's office. They find detailed files on their whole family, including Micah. D.L. is angered to find that they have been used. The pair attempt to determine Micah's whereabouts, and find a painting of Micah in what appears to be a burning New York City. Mohinder continues to research a cure for Molly Walker. Molly finds a long-forgotten photo of Mohinder's parents and sister, which inspires him to investigate his own blood for antibodies to fight the disease. He administers the treatment, and both are hopeful of the results. Peter and Claire go to Petrelli Campaign Headquarters to meet with Nathan. Upon arriving, they see Nathan meeting with Thompson, whom Claire recognizes as her adoptive father's old boss. She identifies him to Peter as the man she is running from. Thompson and Nathan, meanwhile, discuss the planned explosion, and Thompson tells Nathan not to worry or have second thoughts. Later, Nathan's mother arrives and reveals her part in the planning of the explosion. She tells Nathan that after a catastrophe like this, a leader is needed, and tells him that he needs to be that leader. Sylar's mother hides in her room, frightened of her son, while Hiro and Ando look on. Sylar tells his mother that he is sorry, and that she should come out. Ando tells Hiro to kill Sylar now, while he is distracted, but Hiro refuses to kill someone asking for forgiveness. Ando angrily shows him a page of the comic depicting a dead Ando, saying that it if Sylar isn't killed now, it will only lead to his death. Candice Wilmer, as Niki, tells Micah that she is taking a shower. Micah apologizes for their earlier fight, but then attempts to escape when he hears the water running. He runs into the hallway, and enters another room - only to find that he has returned to the same room he left. He tries again, but Candice reveals that the illusion is her doing. She threatens to use her powers to truly frighten him if he makes further attempts at escape, but states that because she enjoys his company, she'll be nice. Peter hands Claire a handgun, telling her that she is the only person who can get close to him if he begins to explode. He instructs her to shoot him in the back of the head, in a spot she knows will prevent him from healing. She reluctantly agrees to carry the weapon. The pair recognize a location from one of Peter's drawings of Ted, and decide to go look for him. Sylar's mother exits her bedroom, telling Sylar that she doesn't know who he is, hysterically asking what he did to her boy. Sylar tries to comfort her, but she attacks with a pair of scissors. In the struggle, she is accidentally stabbed in the chest. Before she can fall, Hiro freezes time and prepares to decapitate Sylar. His concentration falters, however, and time resumes, permitting Sylar to stop the sword's movement. He demands to know why Hiro is following him. Hiro says he must stop Sylar, and Sylar starts taunting Hiro and telling him that he is weak. He calls Hiro a coward, and begins to freeze the sword. Ando bursts into the apartment and Hiro grabs Ando and teleports them away. Hiro and Ando reappear in Isaac's loft, and Ando remarks that they'll have to try again. Hiro finds that the sword, frozen by Sylar, had snapped when they teleported - and that now he has no weapon with which to kill Sylar. Back in Queens, Sylar is seen using Isaac Mendez's ability to paint the future, as he fingerpaints using his mother's blood to duplicate Mendez's earlier painting of the New York explosion. He tells his mother's body that she was right about his potential to become President. In the plaza, Claire looks around at the crowd, consisting mostly of couples including parents and their children; depressed, she laments to Peter about the bad things she feels she has done and the people she feels she hurt because of her powers, and that meeting Peter was the only thing that gave her some sense of belonging; Peter comforts Claire and tells her that he shared a similar feeling upon meeting her. Claire then sees three familiar faces heading toward them: Mr. Bennet, Ted, and Matt Parkman. She runs to her adoptive father and hugs him. As Peter acknowledges Matt and Ted, his hands begin to glow. Ratings In the 18-49 demographic, \\"The Hard Part\\" earned a 5.1/13 ratings share. This episode was watched by 10.40 million people.

Infantry The 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment composed of volunteers from the state of Rhode Island that served with the Union Army in the American Civil War. They, along with the 1st Rhode Island, wore a very simple uniform. The uniform composed of a dark blue jacket like shirt, tannish grey pants, and a dark blue chasseur kepi. The 2nd Rhode Island also wore havelocks in the beginning of the war, but after finding them useless they discarded them. Overview The 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment was organized in June 1861 in Providence. The regiment was initially assigned to the IV Corps of the Army of Northeastern Virginia (later became the Army of the Potomac) and saw its first combat action at the First Battle of Bull Run. The IV Corps later became the VI Corps of the Army of the Shenandoah, and the 2nd Rhode Island participated in several fights in the Shenandoah Valley. The regiment was mustered out of service at Providence on July 13, 1865. History The Second was Rhode Island's fighting regiment. It fired the opening volley at First Bull Run, and was in line at the final scenes of Appomattox. It arrived at Washington, June 22, 1861, and after a few weeks encampment there, marched to the field of First Bull Run. It was then in Burnside's Brigade, of Hunter's Division. Burnside opened that fight with the First Rhode Island deployed as skirmishers, and the Second advancing in line of battle. Its casualties in that engagement aggregated 98 in killed, wounded and missing; among the killed were Colonel Slocum, Major Sullivan Ballou, and two captains. During the Peninsular campaign it served in Palmer's (3d) Brigade, Couch's (1st) Division, Fourth Corps; this division was transferred in October, 1862, to the Sixth Corps as Newton's (3d) Division. The regiment, under Colonel Rogers, distinguished itself in the hard-fought battle of the Sixth Corps at Salem Heights, May 3, 1863, in which action it lost 7 killed, 68 wounded, and 6 missing. At the Wilderness, it lost 12 killed, 66 wounded, and 5 missing; and at Spotsylvania, 15 killed, 32 wounded, and 6 missing. In the final battle of the Sixth Corps‚Äîat Sailor's Creek, April 6, 1865‚Äîthe regiment displayed remarkable fighting qualities, engaging the enemy in an action so close that men were bayoneted, and clubbed muskets were freely used. The original regiment was mustered out June 17, 1864, the recruits and reenlisted men left in the field were organized into a battalion of three companies, to which five new ones were subsequently added in the fall and winter of 1864‚Äì5. Organized at Providence June, 1861. Left State for Washington, D. C., June 19. Attached to Burnside's Brigade, Hunter's Division, McDowell's Army of Northeast Virginia, to August, 1861.

Detailed Service  Under the first call of the President of the United States for additional troops to serve three years or during the war, the Second Regiment of Rhode Island Volunteers was organized. The work of enlistment was spiritedly prosecuted under an order from Governor Sprague, and Camp Burnside was established on the Dexter Training Ground, in Providence. The command of the Regiment was given to Colonel Slocum, promoted from Major of the First Rhode Island, an officer of great personal bravery, who had gained reputation in the Mexican War. Colonel William Goddard, of the Governor's Staff, was detailed temporarily to act as Lieutenant-Colonel, who on being relieved was temporarily succeeded by General Charles T. Robbins. At the request of Colonel Slocum, Colonel Christopher Blanding assisted in drilling the Regiment. To add to the comfort of the men, a thousand rubber blankets were presented to them by the firm of A. & W. Sprague. Many other tokens of interest and regard were also received by officers and men, and the citizens of Lonsdale made a liberal donation to the hospital department. An elegant stand of colors was presented to the Regiment by the ladies of Providence, through Colonel Jabez C. Knight. The ceremonies of the occasion were appropriate and impressive. The colors were assigned to Company D, Captain Nelson Viall, who had served with honor in Mexico. All things being in readiness, the Regiment struck their tents at 2 o'clock, P. M., June 19, 1861, and marched to Exchange Place, where, in the presence of a large crowd of spectators, a short and spirited address was delivered by Bishop Thomas M. Clark, who also invoked the Divine blessing. Resuming their march to Fox Point, they embarked on board the steamer State of Maine, and the Battery accompanying the Regiment, under Captain William H. Reynolds, on board the steamer Kill von Kull. On the morning of June 22, the Regiment, accompanied by Governor Sprague, Hon. John R. Bartlett, Secretary of State, and Bishop Clark, arrived in Washington, warmly welcomed, and encamped in Gales' Woods, near Camp Sprague. On the 26th, the First and Second regiments, with their respective batteries, paid their respects to President Lincoln, by whom they were reviewed. While in camp, the Regiment was brigaded with the First Rhode Island, 71st New York, 2nd New Hampshire, and the two Rhode Island batteries. In this brigade, commanded by Colonel Burnside, they marched to the Battle of Bull Run, leading the column. On that sanguinary and disastrous field, it was the first, with Captain Reynolds battery, to engage, and fought the enemy forty-five minutes without support, losing 28 men killed, 56 wounded, and 30 missing; among the former, Colonel Slocum, Major Sullivan Ballou, and Captains Levi A. Tower and Samuel J. Smith. The men stood up bravely under a heavy fire from the rebel batteries, but to no purpose. The color company was a conspicuous mark, and the regimental colors were completely riddled by balls. Dr. James Harris, Surgeon of the Regiment, was unceasing in the performance of his professional duties through the day, often exposed to danger on the field, and always having words of cheer for the wounded and dying. After the retreat commenced, he remained at his post, and gave himself up a prisoner, rather than be separated from those who so much needed his attention. The death of the brave Colonel Slocum, left the Regiment in the command of Captain Frank Wheaton, of the United States Army, then acting Lieutenant-Colonel, to the Colonelcy of which he was subsequently promoted. Captain Viall, on the fall of Major Ballou, assumed the duty of a field officer, and was afterward promoted to Major of the Regiment. Captain William H. P. Steere received the commission of Lieutenant-Colonel in the same. In retiring from the field, the Regiment preserved its order, and on returning to Washington established temporary quarters at Camp Clark. It subsequently occupied Camp Sprague, and removed thence to Camp Brightwood, where it remained till March, 1862, occupied in drilling, picket service, clearing away forests, and building Fort Slocum- a worthy monument to the memory of its revered commander. On the 26th of March, the Regiment moved with the Army of the Potomac, to enter upon the campaign of the Peninsula. During the siege of Yorktown, it was constantly employed in picket and other important duties. On the evacuation of that place by the rebels, it formed a part of Stoneman's advance in pursuit, and participated in the capture of Fort Magruder, at Williamsburg, saving a regiment that had been badly cut up by unwisely drawing upon it the fire of the fort at eight hundred yards distance. It continued with the advance of Stoneman during its operations on the Pamunky and Chickahominy Rivers, was the first to take possession of White House, took part in the battles of Mechanicsville and Seven Pines, and at Turkey Bend was detached with the 7th Massachusetts, to guard Turkey Bend Bridge, and remained there till Porter's corps crossed. After the Battle of Malvern Hill, when the army fell back to Harrison's Landing, the regiment was assigned to the rear as a cover. On the 5th of July, it was in position on the west side of James River, opposite City Point, occupied in throwing up breastworks. When the Army of the Potomac withdrew from the Peninsula, the Regiment proceeded to the vicinity of Yorktown, where it remained a week destroying earthworks, and August 29 it embarked for Alexandria, where it landed September 1. It shared the fortunes of Pope's Bull Run campaign, was in position at Elk Mountain on the 17th of September, during the Battle of Antietam, and subsequently, after performing a variety of fatiguing duties, marched with Franklin's corps to a position in front of Fredericksburg. In the assault upon that city, December 14, it acted with spirit and efficiency. In the preliminary movements of Franklin's corps, this Regiment was the first to cross the river, in face of a heavy body of rebel infantry and artillery, and deploying as skirmishers, drove in their pickets- a movement executed with the coolness and precision of a regimental drill. Here, Colonel Wheaton was ordered to the command of a brigade that had been under the command of General Howe, and the command of the Regiment devolved on the gallant Colonel Nelson Viall, who received his commission on the field. This he subsequently resigned, and the temporary command of the Regiment fell to Lieutenant-Colonel Goff, an able and highly esteemed officer. He was succeeded by Colonel Horatio Rogers, Jr.,transferred from the 11th R. I. Volunteers. After the battle of the 14th, Colonel (now General) Wheaton received from the Regiment the gift of a superb sword, belt and silver spurs, as a testimony of their regard for him as an officer. In the \\"mud expedition\\" that followed this attack on Fredericksburg, the Second Rhode Island participated. It subsequently went into winter quarters, and was employed in picket duty and the usual camp routine. On the 2nd and 3 May 1863, the Battle of Chancellorsville was fought. On the morning of the 3rd, the Regiment supported General Gibbon's division in carrying Salem Heights, near Fredericksburg, having two men slightly wounded. In the storming of Marye's Heights, on the afternoon of the same day, the most terrible portion of the conflict, and in some sense a separate, independent battle, the Regiment, led by Colonel Rogers, performed deeds of conspicuous valor. At a critical moment, it largely contributed towards checking the enemy when our forces were being driven on the right, and saved a New Jersey regiment, hotly pressed, from annihilation and probable capture. The battle of Gettysburg, Pa., July 1, 2 and 3, next followed. In reaching this field of Union triumph, so dearly purchased, the Regiment made good time, and toward night of the second day, having marched about thirty miles, it took position on the field of battle on the extreme left, as a portion of Sedgwick's reserve. During the whole of the 3rd, though not directly engaged, it was constantly moving, under a storm of shells, to different parts of the field, in support of points hardly pressed, losing one man killed and three wounded, and on the following day was on picket on the further edge of the battle field. In pursuit of the retreating rebels, the Regiment had a picket skirmish at Williamsport, July 12, in which three men were wounded. Continuing its march back into Virginia, the Regiment made camp near Warrenton, July 25, having marched, going and returning, nearly three hundred miles. On the 9th of October, following the Battle of Gettysburg, the rebel General Lee put his army again in motion, to turn the right flank of the forces under Meade, and make a push for Washington; but the falling back of the Federals upon Centreville and Chantilly completely checkmated his purpose. At this point, the 6th Corps, including the Second Rhode Island, occupied the extreme right of the line. In the advance of the Union forces upon Rappahannock Station, November 7, which resulted in the rout of the enemy and the capture of 1600 prisoners, the Regiment was held in reserve; and in another successful advance across the Rapidan, November 26, it participated. A quiet winter at Brandy Station intervened, when on the 4th of May, 1864, the Army of the Potomac began the grand movement that ultimated in the capture of Richmond. The marching and fighting of the succeeding four or five weeks, to reach the Chickahominy, comprises a part of the history of the Regiment. In the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania Court House, and all along the succession of flank movements, it bore an honorable and conspicuous part, and in the sanguinary Battle of Cold Harbor, a few days before its term of service expired, added another to the laurels won on other fields. On the 11th of June, the three-years' men, under the command of Colonel S. B. M. Bead, returned to Providence, and on the 17th were mustered out of service. By order of Governor Smith, they were received by the Division of Militia under the command of Major General Olney Arnold, and escorted to Howard Hall, where a bountiful collation had been provided, and a formal State reception took place. Colonel Read was wounded in the head and leg, May 12, on the third day of the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and was promoted from Lieutenant- Colonel on the 1st of June following, for gallant conduct in the battles of the campaign in which he had participated up to that date. At the date of the mustering out of the first three-years' men, Companies A, B and C, comprising recruits enlisted from time to time, conscripts and re-enlisted veterans, remained in the field before Petersburg. Wishing to preserve to the close of the war the identity of a Regiment that had served so faithfully and bravely, Governor Smith authorized a reorganization, dating from the muster out of the original Regiment. Companies D, E, F, G and H, were recruited and sent forward, and regimental relations were once more established, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Elisha H. Rhodes, brevetted Colonel April 2, 1865, for gallant services before Petersburg. On the 6th of July, 1864, General Early, with a portion of the rebel advance, crossed the Potomac, near Antietam, into Maryland, and made a raid on Washington. The Sixth Army Corps, including the Second Rhode Island, and Batteries C, D and G, were hurried to the defense of the Capital, and reached there just in season to save the city, and to aid in driving the enemy, who had approached within shelling distance, back into the valley of the Shenandoah. The pursuit of the rebels was continued, first under General Wright, and then under General Sheridan, who had been appointed to the command of the Department. In the Battle of Winchester, September 19, the Regiment behaved with great gallantry, and had nine men wounded, one mortally. After this battle the Regiment was detailed as part of the garrison of Winchester, to protect it against guerrillas, as well as to escort trains to the front. It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part. The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault. Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm. The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet. The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced. Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy. The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess. About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet. The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire. The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets. In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken. The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands. The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed. They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers. In this battle the conduct of officers and men was in the highest degree commendable. The new men, who went into action for the first time, fought-like veterans. After the fall of Richmond, and the surrender of the rebel Northern Army, under Lee, the Regiment left that city for Washington, D. C., May 24, was mustered out of the United States service at Hall's Hill, Va., July 13, and left for Providence on the 15th. It reached its destination by the train from New York at 12 o'clock, midnight, July 17, accompanied by the 11th and 58th Massachusetts regiments, bound to Readville. The regiment was received with the cheers of waiting friends, the salute of the Marine Artillery, and the presented arms of Company A, Pawtucket Light Guard, Captain M'Cloy. After the reception, they formed and were escorted to Washington Hall, where they partook of an ample collation, prepared by L. H. Humphreys, under the direction of Captain Henrie Crandall. The Regiment had often been severely depleted by sickness, and by losses upon the battlefield. After the Battle of Malvern Hill in 1862, it could number only 250 effective men. It numbered on its return, 345 officers and men. Under general orders from the War Department, General Meade directed, March 7, 1865, the names of the following battles in which the Regiment had borne a meritorious part, to be inscribed upon its colors, viz: First Bull Run Salem Heights, Petersburg, Yorktown, Gettysburg, Fort Stevens, Williamsburg, Rappahannock Station, Opequan, Malvern Hill, Wilderness, Hatcher's Run, Antietam, Spottsylvania, Sailors' Creek, Fredericksburg, Cold Harbor, Appomattox, Marye's Heights.

It is the second episode of the three-part finale for season one.  Plot  Claire and Mr. Bennet's reunion is cut short by Peter who has reached a dangerous instability after absorbing Ted's ability. Peter tells Claire to be prepared for what she must do to stop him, but just as Claire draws the gun from her bag, Peter gains control over his new ability and prevents himself from exploding. As a dejected Hiro mourns his own lack of conviction and his broken sword, Ando continues to try to restore Hiro's spirits. Ando searches the Yellow Pages to have the sword repaired. Hiro teases Ando about whom he expects to find in the directory to mend a centuries-old katana, but Ando chances upon a swordsmith advertising with the mysterious symbol. Back on the street, Mr. Bennet and Claire finally get a chance to catch up. Mr. Bennet is surprised to discover the relationship between Peter and Claire and tells her of his plan to take out the tracking system so that they will finally live a normal life again; Claire deems a normal life nearly impossible, broaching the abnormality of their situation, and tells Bennet that Peter may be on to something with this \\"save the world\\" thing. As Peter convinces Ted that the two of them need to leave New York City before either causes the explosion, Mr. Bennet and Parkman continue their search for the tracking system. Claire, believing that it may be her destiny, decides to accompany Peter and Ted. Around the corner however is an unexpected eavesdropper with superhuman hearing: Sylar, who learns of Peter's plans to leave the city, and sees an opportunity to further his own agenda. As Nathan Petrelli worries about his trailing poll numbers, he also struggles with what he is being asked to do by Linderman. Linderman reveals to Nathan that Nathan's father was once a part of Linderman's cabal, although he left after disagreements with the group. Linderman attempts to consolidate Nathan's conviction by imparting a surprising gift: he heals Heidi's paralysis. As Peter, Ted and Claire walk the streets of New York on their way out of the city, Peter hears Sylar's thought, and realizes that they are being tailed and that Sylar has learned of Ted's powers. But before they can formulate a plan on what to do, FBI agents, led by Audrey Hanson, arrive on scene and arrest Ted. Peter grabs Claire, turning them both invisible, and escapes. Audrey thanks Sylar, who identifies himself as Isaac Mendez, for the tip about Ted. As Hiro and Ando race across the city, Hiro runs into Nathan. Hiro tells Nathan that in the future, Nathan is a villain. Hiro, convinced that the present Nathan is still a good man, tries to tell Nathan that he must help them try to stop the bomb. Nathan disappoints Hiro, and Hiro realizes that Nathan is already on a possible dark path. Hiro and Ando continue to Jittetsu Arms, the shop of the swordsmith. There they meet a Mr. Claremont, who is amazed by Hiro's possession of the centuries-old Kensei sword. Hiro asks if the sword can be repaired, and the repairman replies that it depends on the decision of a third party who is also in the shop: Hiro's father Kaito, who steps out from the backroom of the shop. Hiro's father asks for a private word with his son, but Ando is wary that Mr. Nakamura may be trying to persuade Hiro to return home to Japan. Hiro tells Ando that he must hear what his father has to say out of respect, but Ando is unconvinced. Up in the Company facility at Kirby Plaza, Candice still holds Micah prisoner. When Candice gives Micah several rare comics, he admits she seems like a nice person. Micah asks why Candice doesn't use her powers to become a hero, but a jaded Candice dismisses Micah's youthful innocence and implies that her current appearance isn't what she really looks like. Mr. Linderman arrives and asks for Micah's help. He tells Micah he will ensure that Micah's family will be able to live happily ever after if Micah will help him \\"talk to machines\\". In the repair shop backroom, Kaito Nakamura reveals he had known of Hiro's powers all along, but had never been convinced that Hiro would have the right spirit to wield his abilities. Having observed Hiro's progress, he is now convinced that Hiro is of true Nakamura descent. Hiro reveals to his father that he may be wrong about him, recounting his failure to kill Sylar when he had the opportunity. But Hiro's father is not so easily disappointed by this news, and reveals himself to be a master swordsman. He tells Hiro that he will teach him the ways of the sword, and turns Hiro into an able swordsman in only a short time, with the aid of Hiro's time manipulation abilities and memories of his favorite bedtime story, The Tale of Kensei And the Dragon. With renewed conviction of his abilities, Hiro sets off to defeat Sylar, only to find that Ando had already left the shop. A horrified Hiro then learns that Ando, believing that Hiro would be unable to continue his mission to kill Sylar, bought a nagamaki from Mr. Claremont and left to hunt down Sylar himself, to almost certain death. Back amidst the frenzy of election day, Candice takes Micah to a polling place. She disguises herself as a voter and introduces Micah to a poll worker as her son. In the voting booth, she asks Micah to alter the votes electronically to give Nathan Petrelli a landslide victory. Micah completes his tasks and, exhausted, asks if he can finally go home. D.L. and Jessica track down Nathan in his office. Jessica confronts Nathan about not killing Mr. Linderman when he had the chance. The pair tells Nathan that Mr. Linderman will only seek to use Nathan as a puppet, and offers to kill Mr. Linderman when Nathan couldn't. Nathan eventually agrees to tell them where Mr. Linderman is, so long as they make sure that they finish the job. Mr. Bennet and Matt find the building housing the tracking system, and attempt to find a way to the top levels of the building. Encountering some difficulties despite Matt's use of his ability to get past the gate security, they meet D.L. and Jessica, who have also arrived in the building. Knowing they have common objectives in the same building, Mr. Bennet convinces D.L. to use his abilities to get them all through the security doors. Mr. Bennet and Matt reach the level housing the tracking system, but unknown to them, they are being watched on the security monitors by Thompson, who is waiting to ambush them. Matt reads Thompson's mind and uncovers the ambush, saving Mr. Bennet's life just in time. Mr. Bennet returns the favor by shooting Thompson in the head twice at point blank range. Having taken care of Thompson, they proceed to the room housing the tracking device, and discover that it is the little girl, Molly Walker. Even though he was aware that the tracking device was in fact a person, Mr. Bennet is surprised to learn that it is a young girl. Matt is shocked, unable to comprehend that they are possibly needing to kill a child. In his state of surprise, he is knocked unconscious by Mohinder, who ends up in a Mexican standoff with Mr. Bennet: Mohinder's gun on Bennet, Bennet's gun on Molly. Ted is being escorted out of the city in an armed police van. Sylar flips the van with his telekinesis, and opens the doors to find an upside-down Ted held in position by his harnesses. Ted screams that he is hurt, and Sylar cuts his head open as Ted screams in pain. Back in the high-rise, D.L. and Jessica pay Linderman a visit. Linderman confirms that he had arranged for D.L. and Jessica's meeting since the beginning, and had been watching them their whole lives. Then, after revealing the location of Micah, he offers Jessica a large amount of money to kill D.L. and give up Micah. Instead, Jessica realizes that this is not what her other half wants, and reverts to Niki. Disappointed with Jessica's lack of ruthlessness, Linderman pulls a gun to kill Niki, but D.L. jumps in the way and takes the bullet. Linderman moves to kill Niki, but D.L. phases his fist inside Linderman's skull, killing him. Niki collapses, holding an apparently dying D.L. in her arms. Nathan wins the election and in his official victory address, delivers a poignant speech; \\"A landslide, that's what they're calling it\\", he proudly announces. Heidi, hiding her miraculous cure from the public, sits on her wheelchair by his side, with Angela behind. Sylar stands upon a rooftop, looking down on the city. He tests his newly acquired ability by creating small radiation bursts within the palms of his hands.

Established in 1970, the CISC has a central bureau in Ottawa and ten bureaus in each province offering services to over 400 law enforcement agencies in Canada.About CISC There are three levels of membership in the CISC. Level I is for police forces responsible for federal and provincial law enforcement which have their own criminal intelligence unit. Level II is for member agencies that have a specific law enforcement role, e.g., the Canada Border Services Agency and Wildlife Service. Level III is for agencies that have a complementary role to law enforcement or give assistance to law enforcement. The level of membership is mirrored to membership with the Canadian Police Information Centre.CPIC Policy Manual Intelligence units of member agencies supply their provincial bureau of the CISC with raw intelligence data, which is then added to an online database, Automated Criminal Intelligence Information System (ACIIS). The Ottawa Bureau is the custodian of the national database, and manages it in consultation with member agencies. The purpose of the CISC initiative is to not only coordinate information sharing across jurisdictions, but to facilitate investigations into organized and serious crime across Canada. The central bureau is staffed by Royal Canadian Mounted Police employees along with secondments from the following agencies: * Canada Border Services Agency * Canadian Forces Military Police * Ontario Provincial Police * Royal Canadian Mounted Police * Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al * S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec * Toronto Police Service * Vancouver Police Department The CISC has a strategic plan consisting of four pillars.The Four Pillars of the Strategic Plan . CISC. The first pillar is criminal intelligence personnel. According to this pillar, the CISC intends to improve national criminal intelligence by directing resources to the cultivation of intelligence expertise and equipment and to attract talent in this field to the CISC through its hiring policies. Secondly, the CISC aims to provide support to its intelligence personnel through the direction given by the leadership of the organization, by making the necessary technological tools available to intelligence personnel based on the \\"need to know/right to know\\" principle, and by facilitating the analysis of intelligence data through training personnel in intelligence analysis methodology and best practices. The second pillar also includes disseminating processed intelligence back to member agencies and measuring the \\"value added\\" of criminal intelligence through assessing feedback and determining the satisfaction of members with the service through a performance-measuring tool called the \\"balance scorecard.\\" The third pillar is \\"criminal intelligence technologies,\\" meaning the maintenance of the ACIIS system and data mining technology, and keeping up-to-date as new technologies develop. The fourth and final pillar is the \\"criminal intelligence communications plan,\\" which consists of coordinating information flows between member agencies as well as with members and non- member partners and instilling strategic-thinking on a national scale in criminal intelligence workers. The CISC also publishes an annual report on organized crime in Canada.

History The British had built military airstrips at Tejgaon, Dhaka during the Second World War for operating warplanes towards the Battle of Kohima and other Burmese war threats. After Independence in 1947, Tejgaon Airport became the first airport to operate civil aviation in then-East Pakistan and it was also a station of the Pakistan Air Force. A number of other British-built military airstrips in Bangladeshi territory were also converted into civil airports ‚Äì some during the East Pakistan period and some after Liberation. A few others were converted to STOL (Short Take-off and Landing) ports some years ago. And some are still left alone. The airstrips not yet converted to any civil airport of any kind are at Feni, Rajendrapur, Pahar Kanchanpur, Chakaria and Rasulpur. Soon after the Second World War broke out, the British authority felt the need to build Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF) stations in Dhaka and other vulnerable places in Bangladeshi territory. The construction of Tejgaon Airport at a place named Dainodda started in 1941; and the building of a landing strip at Kurmitola (Balurghat) started at about the same time. The airstrips at Tejgaon and Kurmitola had military fighter plane landing facilities and the British Royal Air Force used the airstrips for maintenance and storage of their aircraft. There was also a United States Air Force detachment here during the war. The first RIAF light fighter landed on the under‚Äëconstruction runway of Tejgaon at the beginning of 1943 and after development of the airport facilities, it became the first civil airport of Bangladesh. Today it is a part of BAF (Bangladesh Air Force) Base Bashar. Following the transfer of civilian flights to the newly built Shahjalal International Airport in 1981, Tejgaon was taken under the control of the Bangladesh Air Force. In mid-2011, the Bangladesh Air Force raised objections to a proposed 19-metre high metro rail along Bijoy Sarani, arguing that the metro rail would hinder military air operations from the Tejgaon airstrip, it made a plea that the airfield be kept functional. The BAF also recommended an alternative route along Khamarbari-Farmgate which would affect the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. The prime minister opted for the realignment of the route along the parliament complex in line with the BAF suggestion, a move which drew huge flak from different technical experts. The experts, among whom are architects, planners and civic activists, termed the BAF stance unfounded on many occasions and strongly argued that the metro rail would not affect the present operations of the airfield. The airstrip hasn't been used since 1988 and it is seriously affecting Dhaka city's development. Between 16 and 17 October 2011, the CAAB quietly upgraded it from a short take-off and landing (STOL) port to a domestic airport. This increased the importance of the airport. The CAAB had declared this on their website, however, its website details on navigational aides, air traffic service and aeronautical communications for air operations in Bangladesh territory didn't mention Tejgaon airfield as an airport. A domestic airport requires all the technical features and passenger services as an international airport as per rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation but the Tejgaon Airport does not have the services required for a STOL port. Airlines and destinations Although the airfield's status was upgraded to that of a domestic airport in October 2011, no airlines serve it yet.

Gameplay  The rules of the game can be changed to cater to many popular variations, though the most common rules of chess are the default rules. During a game, clicking on a piece will show the available places to move to. If a piece is captured, a short video plays showing the captured character being caught, with each different capture having its own video clip. These clips are rarely related to chess. Because pawns, knights, rooks, kings, queens and bishops all have separate video clips for catching other pawns, knights, rooks, queens and bishops, there are 60 clips total.  Story mode  In story mode, the player can pick either a western or pirates theme. After selecting the theme, a three-game chess tournament against the AI begins. In the first game the AI is at 25% difficulty, in the second game the AI is at 50% difficulty, and in the third and final game, the AI is at 75% difficulty. Before each match, a cutscene plays, ending with the protagonists having a task to complete. In the western theme, a sheriff is trying to capture three bank robbers, and in the pirate theme, a soldier is trying to beat some pirates to a treasure. After each match is over, another cutscene plays, with the protagonists either succeeding or failing the task, depending on the match's outcome. (Using the same example, either the sheriff catches a bandit, one for each match, or all of them escape.) After completing a story, a printable certificate is rewarded.  Tutorial mode  The tutorial mode teaches how to play chess, from the basics of movement for the different pieces, to advanced playing techniques. The player is taught by \\"The Chess King\\", a Lego King Minifig who talks like Elvis, and who supposedly commands the white army. The Chess King slightly modernizes the explanations of the pieces. For example, it is said that the reason knights can jump over other pieces is that they ride BMX Motor Bikes. The King on his throne was also a Lego set, packaged with the first release of the game.  Versus mode  In this mode, the player can choose the difficulty of the game when playing against the AI. Multi-player mode can also be selected here. Alternatively, the player can watch the computer play against itself. In addition, a third, traditional chess set (though still constructed from Lego bricks) can be chosen, and all three sets can be mixed (pirates playing against western, for example). However, animations for capturing pieces are disabled when playing with mixed sets. Players can also remove or add pieces from gameplay before or during the game. Reception Lego Chess received favourable reviews from game critics, stating its creative way of using Lego pieces as a \\"fun and entertaining way of playing chess.\\" Other reviews were not as positive, due to the bland style of the cutscenes and claims that cutscenes featuring the tribal drum noise were \\"creepy\\".

The stalemate diffuses when Molly and Matt Parkman spot each other. Sylar is seen painting the predicted fight between himself and Peter, whom he immediately recognizes. Hiro tells his father he must save Ando and stop Sylar. He teleports to Isaac Mendez's loft, where Ando has been pinned against the wall by Sylar. Hiro arrives to face Sylar, and Sylar challenges Hiro to move faster than he can. To Sylar's surprise, Hiro teleports across the room to Ando and they both disappear before Sylar can do anything more. Having just killed Linderman, an injured D.L. and Niki continue the search for Micah. Once the correct room is found, Niki leaves D.L. behind to get Micah. When Niki enters the door, it appears that Jessica is in the room with a dead Micah. When she engages Niki in a fight, Niki sees the real Jessica in a broken mirror, who tells her that the other person is not her and that she still needs to save Micah. With a super-powered uppercut from the floor up, Niki throws the impostor across the room, revealing it to be Candice. She hears Micah screaming from a closet and rescues him. She then looks in a mirror and sees only herself. Nathan seems to have finally accepted his responsibility as congressman and future president. Nathan's mother informs him that Mr. Linderman is indeed dead, and yet he is unsure if that is a good thing. He seems convinced that his brother Peter will indeed explode, and also that he has no plans to try to prevent the impending disaster. Molly appears to have relapsed into her health problem from \\"Landslide\\" and Suresh is treating her. As this happens, Mr. Bennet contacts Peter, who informs him of Sylar's new power gained from killing Ted Sprague. Bennet confides in him to stop Sylar before disaster strikes, and begs him to look after Claire. Peter visits Nathan and tries to recruit him in taking on Sylar, and asserts that Sylar must be the one who explodes; however he reflexively hears Nathan's thoughts and realizes that his brother has no intention of stopping the explosion. Peter realizes that Claire was right about not trusting Nathan, but turns to see that she has fled. He tries to locate her in an empty street, but his new \\"nuclear\\" powers start to take over as his emotions rise and he collapses. Matt Parkman learns of Molly's amazing ability, but she is distraught to admit that she cannot find \\"everyone\\": there is one person she claims to be unable to find, someone \\"far worse\\" than Sylar, and that when she looks for him, he can see her. When Suresh, Parkman, and Bennet ask Molly to find Sylar, she locates him at Isaac Mendez's loft and Parkman decides to go confront him only to find that Sylar has already left for Kirby Plaza. Meanwhile, Bennet has left to find Peter and Molly tells Suresh that Sylar is now \\"here\\" and they try to make their way out of the building. When they arrive at the elevator, they see an injured D.L., whom Mohinder treats for his wounds, but they find that the elevator will not work. As armed guards approach, Niki and Micah arrive and Micah makes the elevator work. The entire group heads down for the final confrontation. Hiro has teleported himself and Ando back to their office in Japan, escaping Sylar's clutches once more. Ando is determined to help in Sylar's defeat, but Hiro is adamant that his friend remain behind. Hiro assures his friend that he has already proven himself a hero: by facing Sylar without any powers of his own, Ando demonstrated true bravery and inspired Hiro to complete the quest. Hiro states that he must finish it alone, and gives Ando his Kensei sword, telling Ando, \\"so you know I'll be back.\\" Peter finds himself within a flashback during his time caring for Charles Deveaux and sees his mother speaking to Charles about the bomb. He also views the first meeting of himself and Simone Deveaux. Peter believes no one can see him until his mother leaves and Charles confronts him. Charles reveals that he knew about the plan to use Nathan as a catalyst to heal the world, but he felt that Peter is the only one with enough love in his heart to truly accomplish it. He then calls the other Peter, who comes to escort him back into the house. When Mr. Bennet awakens Peter, he thanks Peter for saving Claire's life, and tells Peter \\"Call me Noah\\" (revealing his given name for the first time in the series). In the climax, Peter, Bennet, and Parkman confront Sylar in the plaza. Bennet is immediately thrown against a wall, rendering him incapable of stopping Peter if he explodes. Parkman shoots at Sylar, who stops the bullets and turns them back at Parkman, who is hit in the chest. Sylar then telekinetically uproots a parking meter, sends it flying into his free hand, and brutally hits Peter in the stomach with it. Niki steps in and hits Sylar's torso with the meter, saving Peter, who then tells Niki that he can handle the rest and she should return to her family. He grabs Sylar and punches him repeatedly, with Sylar being unable to retaliate. After the final punch, Sylar begins to laugh mockingly at the now glowing Peter. Peter, now losing control over his concentration of controlling Ted's power, realizes that he will be the bomb after all. Sylar stands and taunts Peter, calling him a villain and indicating himself as the hero. As Sylar is about to move forward, Hiro arrives and distracts him. Before Sylar can attack, Hiro impales him with a nodachi and seems to fatally wound him. However, before Hiro can do anything about Peter's request that he kill him, Sylar performs one last act and telekinetically throws Hiro into the air, however, Hiro teleports before he strikes a nearby building. Sylar collapses, seeing a series of visions of everyone who has died due to his own actions as well as himself before his eyes glaze over. As Peter's hands continue to glow, Claire arrives and takes Bennet's gun. She approaches Peter, gun raised as Peter tells her that she is the only one who can, but, in tears, she begs him to think of another way. \\"There is no other way.\\" Peter says, resolutely. However, before she is able to gather herself to continue, Nathan drops from the sky unexpectedly and says that Claire was right; the future wasn't written in stone after all. The view of the explosion from the ground at Kirby Plaza. Peter realizes what Nathan intends to do and tries to persuade his brother not to give his life. Nathan assures Peter stating he had \\"saved the cheerleader, so we could save the world.\\" Peter reluctantly agrees and Nathan grabs him and flies off far above New York where a large explosion is seen in the night sky moments later. Matt Parkman is shown being loaded into an ambulance, barely alive. At the end of this scene, the camera shows a trail of blood leading from where Sylar's body was to an open manhole with a cockroach crawling in, leading his \\"death\\" open to question, and the words \\"End of Volume One\\" appear on the screen. Concluding Narration Following the conclusion of the battle at Kirby Plaza, and the nuclear explosion above New York, Mohinder Suresh concludes the episode with a continuation of his earlier narration, followed by a preview of Volume Two: Generations > \\"We dream of hope, we dream of change, of fire, of love, of death.

Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Limited at Coventry. Design and development Armstrong Whitworth AW.15 Atalanta The AW.15 Atalanta was designed to meet a 1930 Imperial Airways requirement for a four- engined airliner for its African lines, in particular for the service between Kisumu in Kenya and Cape Town, South Africa. The specification called for an airliner that could carry nine passengers, three crew and a load of freight for 400 mi (640 km), cruising at 115 mph (185 km/h) at 9,000 ft (2,740 m). Imperial Airways had decided to standardise on four-engined aircraft to prevent the failure of a single engine causing forced landings.Tapper 1988, p. 219. The prototype, G-ABPI, was named Atalanta and first flown on 6 June 1932,Tapper 1988, p. 224. by Alan Campbell-Orde from Whitley Abbey. The Atalanta was a high-wing monoplane with four 340 hp (250 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Serval III ten-cylinder (two rows of 5 cylinders) radial engines. Its composite construction included steel, plywood and fabric; the undercarriage was fixed but was streamlined to minimize drag. The overall design of the aircraft was rather modern, and somewhat closed the performance gap between British and American airliners. The aircraft had few design flaws and any teething problems were quickly overcome. The prototype was flown to Croydon Airport for acceptance by Imperial Airways, and on 26 September 1932, it flew a commercial service from Croydon to Brussels and Cologne.Williams Aeroplane Monthly October 1980, pp. 510‚Äì511. The Atalanta could carry up to 17 passengers but Imperial Airways limited the seating to nine for the planes on the Indian route and 11 on the African route. On 20 October 1932, the prototype was damaged in a test flight due to fuel starvation. Armstrong Whitworth was embarrassed by the accident and renamed the third production machine (G-ABTI, Arethusa) as Atalanta, hoping nobody would notice the swap.Tapper 1988, p. 227. Two derivatives of the Atalanta were proposed: the Jaguar-powered AW.25 and Panther-powered AW.26, but neither left the drawing board. Operational history G-ABPI in the service of Imperial Airways in 1936 Imperial Airways ordered eight aircraft which had all been delivered by 1933. The first service was flown from Croydon Airport to Brussels and then Cologne on 26 September 1932. The prototype G-ABPI left Croydon Airport on 5 January 1933 on a proving flight to Cape Town, South Africa. Three other aircraft joined it in South Africa to fly the service between Cape Town and Kisumu, although they proved to be too small for the traffic. On 1 July 1933, an Atalanta flew the first direct air mail service between London and Karachi. Two Indian-registered and two British-registered aircraft operated a Karachi- Calcutta service with was later extended to Rangoon and Singapore. On 29 May 1933, G-ABTL flew through to Melbourne, Australia (arriving on 30 June) on a route survey flight. Imperial withdrew the Atalanta from its African routes in 1937, with two being leased by Wilson Airways for operations in Kenya until July 1938. The African Atalantas were then transferred to India.Williams Aeroplane Monthly November 1980, p. 568. Three aircraft were lost before the Second World War and the remaining five aircraft were taken over by BOAC. In March 1941, they were impressed into use by the Royal Air Force in India, being used to ferry reinforcements to Iraq in response to the Rashid Ali uprising. In December 1941, they were handed over to the Indian Air Force for use on coastal reconnaissance duties, armed with a single .303 in (7.7 mm) machine gun operated by the navigator. The last patrol was flown on 30 August 1942 and the two survivors were transferred to transport duties where they continued in use until June 1944.\\"Airlines and Airliners: Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta.\\" century-of-flight.net.

Ortiz joined Warren Publishing in 1974 due to his connections with the Valencia studio of Selecciones Ilustradas. He would remain with Warren until 1983 and drew more stories for that company (approximately 120) than any other artist. His work included the series Apocalypse, Night of the Jackass and Coffin in Eerie, as well as Pantha in Vampirella and numerous stand alone stories. Ortiz would also draw Vampirella herself in issues 35 and 36 that title. He won the award for 'Best All Around Artist' at Warren in 1974. A sample of Jose Ortiz's work, from Eerie #65. Following this period in the U.S. comics industry making horror comics, he returned to Spain and formed a lasting and fertile working partnership with Antonio Segura in 1981, initiated by the serial publication of Hombre, a post-apocalyptic saga, in the magazine Cimoc. By 1983, Ortiz and Segura joined with several other artists including Leopold S√°nchez, Manfred Sommer and Jordi Bernet, to form the short-lived publishing house Metropol with the artists' interest in mind, responsible for three comics magazines, Metropol, Mocambo and KO c√≥mics. During the 1980s Ortiz also produced work for a number of British publications including The Tower King and The House of Daemon for Eagle and The Thirteenth Floor for Scream!. He then moved over to 2000 AD in 1984 where he contributed to a number of stories with most work on Rogue Trooper. In addition to the continued run of Hombre, Ortiz and Segura created Ives and Las Mil Caras de Jack el Destripador (The Thousand Faces of Jack the Ripper) the following years, later renaming Ives to Morgan. In 1987, they began the humorous sci-fi series Burton & Cyb, followed in 1990 by the series Juan el Largo. From 1993, Ortiz focused on the Italian comics market, illustrating stories for Tex Willer, Ken Parker and Magico Vento. He died at Valencia on 23 December 2013.http://www.levante- emv.com/cultura/2013/12/24/muere-dibujante-jose-ortiz/1063019.html In SpanishIn Memoriam: Jos√© Ortiz Moya  Bibliography = French titles  * Le petit sauvage (1980, Editions du Triton, ) * L'apocalypse (1982, Campus Editions, ) * Hombre, with Antonio Segura **HS1.

Keith was born in Boston, Massachusetts and worked in his fathers laboratory. He was instrumental in designing, manufacturing, and installing the original electric lighting and power system in San Francisco, California. In 1884 he became editor of Electric World, co-founded the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and served as the first secretary of the organization. The AIEE merged with other societies in 1963 to become the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Biography. N. S. Keith grew up experimenting in his father's laboratory in New York City. He was educated in the common schools of Dover, N. H. and New York City, and attended the New York University Medical School, but never practiced medicine.Obituary in Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (February 1925) He also learned the basics of chemistry in the laboratory of his father, Bethuel Keith & Co., a physician and chemist in drug manufacturer (Bethuel Keith 1811-1884). In 1860, at age 22, he followed the Pikes Peak Gold Rush to Colorado where he spent nearly a decade mining and milling in the Central City-Blackhawk area. He experimented with various processes to work the rebellious gold ores (see \\"Ore Roasting Furnace\\" Patent No. 36437, Sept 9, 1862). Although the \\"Keith Process\\" of ore crushing and smelting worked in the laboratory, he failed to perfect the system on an industrial scale. He was superintendent of several mining operations, including the well known Mammoth mine, which closed when the vein pinched out. Returning to the East by 1870, he became a respected New York City chemist and began experimenting with electricity. He operated nickel plating works in Newark and patented a method to remove tin from scrap, patented in 1876. He also patented early electric lights and motors, among the earliest patents. He was active in professional organizations, being a co-founder of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and editor and founder of Electronic World. At the same time he authored Magnetic and Dynamo-Electric Machines (1884) and translated German texts on electric motors. Lured West again, in 1884 he built the first electric plant for San Francisco. Between 1884 and 1893 he was among the first to apply electricity to mining, especially electro-metallurgy. Located in San Francisco he served as consultant to mining companies across the West. He would also patent several more pieces of mine machinery (a ball crusher [the \\"Keith Pulverizer\\"]) and amalgamation equipment (the commonly used centrifugal electrical amalgamation machine). In San Francisco, he also sold electric motors to meet burgeoning demand, but sold out with the crash of 1893. During much of 1893-1897 he was in England trying to promote his electro- metallurgical process for the extraction of precious metals from their ores. He returned to the United States and became an advisor to Thomas Edison, based in Philadelphia. He worked on the ill-fated electro-magnetic mining operations funded by Edison. He also worked on electric extraction of copper from its ores, helping organize a company to test his process in the old copper mines of New Jersey. At the time of his death he was still director or officer in a number of mining companies, including the Metals Recovery Company and the American Mines & Venture Corporation.\\"Dr. Keith, Advisor of Edison, Dies,\\" Philadelphia Public Ledger newspaper January 28, 1925, copy in Nathaniel S.

John Farmer, Lancaster, MA: Carter Andrews & Co., 1829., p 51 Edward Bishop Jr. and his wife, Sarah (n√©e Wildes), were accused of witchcraft and imprisoned in the spring of 1692. They were transferred to the Boston jail, and escaped in October of that same year. Edward Bishop Jr. and Sarah Bishop had a number of children, including Edward Bishop III. Edward III eventually married Susannah Putnam, a relation of the Putnam family who were the main accusers in the witchcraft hysteria. Edward Bishop, the sawyer, was perhaps not closely related to the other Edward Bishops. Edward Bishop, the sawyer, married Bridget Playfer. Bridget Bishop lived on Conant Street in Salem Town. Bridget Playfer married Samuel Wasselbe on April 13, 1660 at St. Mary-in-the-Marsh in Norwich.Parish registers of Norwich, county Norfolk Samuel Wasselbe and Bridget had two children: A son named Benjamin, Norwich parish registers list as baptized on October 6, and daughter Mary born in Boston. In the listing for Boston births for 1665, there is a listing for \\"Mary, of Samuel dec. and Bridget Wesselbee late of Norwich England born Jan.10\\".Boston Record Commissioners Report 9 (1883): 98 It is unknown if Samuel died in England or accompanied Bridget to New England and died there, but her second marriage to Thomas Oliver (also from Norwich England) on July 26, 1666 was a troubled one. She had one child with Thomas, a daughter named Christian. After his death she was accused of bewitching her husband to death. Bridget was again accused of witchcraft in April 1692 and hanged in June of that year. That second arrest warrant still exists, referring to as \\"wife of Edward Bishop, the sawyer\\". After the death of his wife Bridget, Edward married Elizabeth Cash on 9 March 1693. Bridget Bishop and Sarah (Wildes) Bishop are often confused. Sarah (Wildes) Bishop and her stepmother Sarah (Averill) Wildes are also sometimes confused. It may have been Sarah (Wildes) Bishop, rather than Bridget, who ran an inn that served drinks to underaged patrons and allowed 'shovel'-board to be played at all hours of the night. Sarah Bishop owned and lived at an inn located in Salem Village, next door to Christian Trask. Trask confronted the Bishops about the late night revelry, and a few weeks later supposedly committed suicide by slashing her own throat with a pair of sewing scissors. A petition in defense of Rebecca Nurse confirms that Edward Bishop Sr. could not have been the husband of Bridget Bishop. When Rebeccah Nurse was accused of witchcraft, a petition in her defense was signed by 39 of her neighbors, including Edward and Hannah Bishop (spelled Edward Besop Sr and Hana Besop on the petition). Since Hannah was able to sign the petition presented in a document at the trials, she was therefore still alive in 1692; and Edward Sr. could not have been married to Bridget at the same time. It is unlikely that the signature belonged to his daughter Hannah as she was then married and would have been known by her married name. SourcesFurther reading * Upham, Charles (1980).

It was based in Shcheglovsk, Kuzbass, Siberia. History=Creation of the Autonomous Industrial Colony Almost from the very beginning of its existence, the Soviet government considered it necessary to use foreign capital, knowledge and experience through the conclusion of concession agreements, which was reflected in the corresponding decision of the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets held in December 1917 . In 1921, the country began the \\"restoration of the national economy\\" with the New Economic Policy. The restoration of the heavy industry of Kuzbass was proclaimed one of the paramount tasks. At the Tenth Party Congress, Vladimir Lenin said that the fuel crisis had led to the need to spend gold on the purchase of coal from abroad. Lenin, realizing that the economic crisis in Russia was too deep and that industry in the young Soviet Republic could not be restored on its own, wrote the \\"Letter to American Workers\\". In this letter, he called on workers of the Communist Parties of developed countries to help organize a new industrial base for the new workers' state. Foreign workers, mostly Americans, led by Sebald Rutgers and Bill Haywood, responded to the Soviet government. The response contained a proposal to establish a colony of foreign workers and specialists in Kuzbass. They met with Lenin in Moscow in September 1921. On behalf of the Industrial Workers of the World, this group expressed its desire to commission the Nadezhda Metallurgical Plant and part of the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia and the Urals, in order to organize an industrial colony of American workers there. The Kuzbass Society was created, in the United States, and it began recruiting volunteers to work in the colony. In March 1922, an announcement was published in a number of US communist publications: ‚ÄúPioneers are needed for Siberia! .. For industrial construction ... to support the Russian Revolution and to show the world what free workers can do when their talent is not hindered by the profit system and when they themselves are the sole owners of the products of their labor.‚Äù The negotiation process between representatives of the Soviet authorities and the American initiative group continued until the end of 1921 .. The agreement between the Council of Labor and Defense (STO) and the board of colonists composed of Bill Haywood, Sebald Rutgers and others, on the creation of an autonomous industrial colony in Kuzbass, was signed on December 25, 1921 in Moscow. Under this agreement, the colonists received the disposal of a mine in the Kemerovo region, a plant still under construction and 10 thousand hectares of land for agricultural purposes. Foreigners, in turn, pledged to work in Russia for at least 2 years, live according to the laws of the RSFSR and obey all resolutions of the service station. The colonists pledged to restore all the enterprises transferred to them and to purchase the advanced equipment necessary for mines and production abroad. The Soviet government categorically insisted on the condition that all financing and supply of American workers would be carried out without raising funds from the Soviet budget. On the initiative of Lenin, the leaders and members of the colony had to pay a ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù and would collectively be responsible for ensuring that ‚Äúonly people who are capable and willing to consciously endure a series of severe deprivations, inevitably associated with the restoration of industry in a country that is very backward and ruined‚Äù . The American side, represented by Rutgers, categorically opposed the intervention of the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy in the affairs of the \\"autonomous industrial colony.\\" Serious disagreements between the Soviet authorities (represented by Valerian Kuybyshev) and the autonomous workers, including on the financial conditions and the composition of the colony's organizing committee, subject to approval by the Labor and Defense Council, prevented practical steps to transfer Kuzbass to operation. In addition, a group of American enthusiasts received complaints from Ludwig Martens, who described Haywood as ‚Äúonly an agitator, semi-anarchist,‚Äù and Rutgers as ‚Äúa wonderful comrade and propagandist,‚Äù but ‚Äúhardly an administrator.‚Äù .  Organization's activities Foreigners examined many areas of Kuzbass (Novokuznetsk, Bachatsky, Guryevsk, Kiselyovsk, Kuznetsky). The Kemerovo Rudnik, in which there was the necessary infrastructure and labor resources, was considered the most suitable for the endeavor. The official registration of the AIC took place on December 22, 1922. At the first stage, the colony was handed the mines of the Kemerovo, by 1923 the Kolchuginsky, Prokopyevsky and Kiselevsky mines were added. At the same time, two representative offices of the AIC in New York and Berlin opened, which were engaged in the search for workers for the colony and made purchases of equipment. The colony‚Äôs activities were covered in the Kuzbass Bulletin regularly published in New York by the Kuzbass Society . About 750 workers and specialists arrived from abroad to work at the AIC enterprises in the Kuznetsk basin. The national composition of the colonists was quite diverse, there were Americans, Finns, Germans, Yugoslavs, Russians (about 30 nationalities in total). Despite the fact that the basis of the colony was represented by foreigners, a significant percentage of the workers were Russian miners, their number was in the region of 5000 people. According to data, about 500 Americans were employed there, instead of the planned 3 thousand (in total, 560 foreigners worked in the colony) . About 8 thousand people were employed at the colony enterprises by the end of 1923. In the official documents of the colony, there was no mention of the predominantly American composition of the volunteer contingent that worked in it, but in the press and even in official documents it often appeared under the name \\"American Colony\\" . The colony was headed by Sebald Rutgers, who left this post in 1926 for health reasons . Kutkin, the Russian engineer who replaced Rutgers as the head of the AIC, turned the entire foreign colony against himself, which led to its gradual elimination. The colonists, together with the Soviet government, sought to make the AIC an independent industrial unit in the Kuznetsk basin. Moreover, the AIC claimed the right of an exemplary enterprise, to which the rest should be equal. But the main task for foreigners was the restoration and development of the heavy coal industry of Kuzbass. The center of their activity was the Kemerovo region, where the main enterprises and the board of the entire organization were located. The ‚ÄúKuzbass AIC‚Äù reconstructed a number of mines, built and put into production the first chemical processing plant in Russia and organized an advanced agricultural farm. Under the AIC, villages in the Kemerovo region were massively electrified and luxury districts were built in the cities of Kuzbass. Dissolution of the AIC Despite its successes, the contract with AIC was terminated on December 28, 1926. The industrial colony paid off in the recovery period with its limited production size, but when industrialization began, the pace of development accelerated and the scale of industry expanded, the AIC could no longer maintain efficiency with its own special form of organization. In 1923, foreign experts, in particular Americans, began to be arrested and repressed, some were shot in the 1930s. A significant number of the American workers returned to the United States . By 1926, no more than 10 colonists remained in Russia, who soon left for other cities of the country. One of the remaining leaders of the AIC, a former worker at the Ford plant in Detroit and the first elected mayor of the American village in Kuzbass, John Tuchelsky, was transferred to the Gorky Automobile Plant after the liquidation of the AIC and later executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet encyclopedic reference books contain no mention of AIC and its noticeable contribution to the industrial development of Siberia.

He has appeared on or been quoted in numerous local, national and international media outlets about the topic, including CNN, Fox News, the New York Times, MSNBC, the Washington Post, Newsweek, The Nation Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, HDNet with Dan Rather and Financial Times.https://vincentfort.com/meet-vincent/ He has also sponsored and co-sponsored bills against prostitution, hate crimes, drug- related nuisances, discrimination against citizens with disabilities, racial profiling, disabled access to housing, and collective bargaining for law enforcement officers. His hate crimes legislation made him the first Georgia legislator to sponsor a bill to create a state hate crimes law.https://vincentfort.com/meet-vincent/ Fort has been described as a supporter of Grady Memorial Hospital.Associated Press (September 27, 2007) \\"Fort, others chastise Johnson\\" ABCmoney.co.uk Accessed November 6, 2011.

Fighting for minority business access in the city and the state has been a top priority for Senator Fort. In 2015 he led the effort to push for a board-adopted Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program after passage of the Transportation Bill (H.B. 170). The bill called for an increase in gasoline tax and other fees to make available $900,000,000 per year in transportation improvements statewide. The Department of Transportation DBE program aims to enable African-Americans, women and other minority businesses to compete on a level playing field.https://vincentfort.com/meet-vincent/ In February 2010, Fort opposed a bill that would prevent Georgians from being forced to receive a microchip implant against their will, calling it \\"a solution in search of a problem.\\"Ga. Senate: No Forced Microchip Implants In Humans  11alive.com On October 26, 2011, Senator Fort was arrested along with 52 other members of Occupy Atlanta, in support of the protesters.http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/occupy-atlanta- protesters-show-1209963.html Senator Fort was also arrested in a protest for Medicaid expansion in Georgia at the office of Governor Nathan Deal. In the aftermath of the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Fort criticized police militarization in Georgia. In February 2016, Fort announced he would relinquish his support for Hillary Clinton and support Bernie Sanders for President of the United States instead. He issued a statement saying, \\"After months of looking at Bernie‚Äôs record and studying his positions on healthcare, Wall Street, predatory lending and the minimum wage, I came to the conclusion that Bernie‚Äôs position on the issues that affect my constituents in Georgia the most conform most closely to my positions.\\" Senator Fort also cited the ejection of Black Lives Matter protestors from a Hillary Clinton speech at Clark Atlanta University in 2015 as motivation to shy away from the Clinton campaign during the primary. His endorsement of Bernie Sanders for President made Fort the highest-ranking African-American legislator in the South to endorse Sanders. As a candidate for Mayor of Atlanta, Vincent Fort was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, former Democratic Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, Atlanta Hip-Hop artist and business owner Michael Render, also known as Killer Mike, as well as 28 local labor unions. His key campaign issues include affordable housing and stopping gentrification in Atlanta, as well as providing two free years of community and technical college to graduates of Atlanta public schools.https://vincentfort.com/issues/ Fort's platform had been described as democratic socialist. On September 30th 2017, Bernie Sanders held a rally for Vincent Fort in Saint Philip AME Church in Atlanta's East Lake neighborhood. Fort finished fifth in the November election, receiving only 9,310 (10%) of the votes which were cast.

He was the son of Luke Hayden, a blacksmith at Roscommon, and was educated locally. He was secretary of one of the first Home Rule County organizations, the branch started in Co. Roscommon at the beginning of the movement. In about 1877 he succeeded O'Conor Eccles as proprietor of the Roscommon Messenger. He was Chairman of the town commissioners of the borough of Roscommon from 1880 until his death. For a time, he was a justice of the peace, but was dismissed on account of his Nationalist opinions. He spent 7 months as a suspect in prison in Galway and Monaghan in 1881 and 1882.Roscommon Messenger, 26/6/1897 He won the new seat of South Leitrim by a huge majority over the Conservative candidate in the 1885 general election and was then returned unopposed in the 1886 general election. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split over Charles Stewart Parnell‚Äôs leadership in 1890, Hayden supported Parnell. He did not contest South Leitrim in the 1892 general election, but stood in his native seat of South Roscommon where he defeated the sitting Anti-Parnellite Andrew Commins by a comfortable margin, taking 63 per cent of the vote in a straight fight. He was one of only nine pro-Parnellites elected to Parliament in that election. In the 1895 general election the prominent anti-Parnellite John Dillon attempted to oust him from South Roscommon, by standing there as well as in his own seat of Mayo East. Dillon however made little dent in his majority, Hayden taking 58 per cent of the vote, again in a straight fight. Luke Hayden was a popular local figure and his funeral cort√®ge in the county town of Roscommon on 25 June 1897 was over a mile long. The following month, he was succeeded in his South Roscommon seat by his younger brother John Patrick Hayden, also a Parnellite, who was returned unopposed. Footnotes References  * Brian M.

It is a New York State Historic Site and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic place of local significance since 1982. The house was named for George Clinton, who served as the first Governor of New York and fourth Vice- President of the United States. He was believed to have lived there after the American Revolutionary War, but it is now known that it was never his residence. The house probably served as a meeting place for legislators during the time Poughkeepsie was capital of New York in 1777. Clinton House was built around 1765 by Clear Everitt, who was sheriff of the county from 1754 to 1761, on land that had belonged to Hugh van Kleeck (born about 1745, died after 1810) who owned about 20 hectares of land south of Main Street where the house stands.

Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912 In 1780, the house was purchased by Udney Hay, who belonged to Quartermaster Corp of the Continental Army. In 1783, the house was destroyed by fire and Hay rented the nearby Glebe House. When his house was damaged by fire, Hay petitioned George Washington for craftsmen from the army to assist in its repair. However, Hay lost the house in 1786 when it was seized for debt. In 1900, the house had fallen into disrepair and it was purchased by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who presented it to the then Governor of New York Theodore Roosevelt for the citizens of the State of New York. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

It comprises 60 percent of all coal combustion waste (labeled here as coal combustion products).It is most commonly used as a high-performance substitute for Portland cement or as clinker for Portland cement production. Cements blended with fly ash are becoming more common. Building material applications range from grouts and masonry products to cellular concrete and roofing tiles. Many asphaltic concrete pavements contain fly ash. Geotechnical applications include soil stabilization, road base, structural fill, embankments and mine reclamation. Fly ash also serves as filler in wood and plastic products, paints and metal castings. *Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) materials are produced by chemical ‚Äúscrubber‚Äù emission control systems that remove sulfur and oxides from power plant flue gas streams. FGD comprises 24 percent of all coal combustion waste. Residues vary, but the most common are FGD gypsum (or ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù gypsum) and spray dryer absorbents. FGD gypsum is used in almost thirty percent of the gypsum panel products manufactured in the U.S. It is also used in agricultural applications to treat undesirable soil conditions and to improve crop performance. Other FGD materials are used in mining and land reclamation activities. *Bottom ash and boiler slag can be used as a raw feed for manufacturing portland cement clinker, as well as for skid control on icy roads. The two materials comprise 12 and 4 percent of coal combustion waste respectively. These materials are also suitable for geotechnical applications such as structural fills and land reclamation. The physical characteristics of bottom ash and boiler slag lend themselves as replacements for aggregate in flowable fill and in concrete masonry products. Boiler slag is also used for roofing granules and as blasting grit. Environmental impacts The majority of CCPs are landfilled, placed in mine shafts or stored in ash ponds at coal- fired power plants. Groundwater pollution from unlined ash ponds has been a continuing environmental problem in the United States. Additionally some of these ponds have had structural failures, causing massive ash spills into rivers, such as the 2014 Dan River coal ash spill. Federal design standards for ash ponds were strengthened in 2015,EPA. \\"Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities.\\" , 2015-04-17. although various provisions of the new regulations are on hold as of 2019, pending ongoing litigation and revisions to the regulations.EPA. \\"Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities; Enhancing Public Access to Information; Reconsideration of Beneficial Use Criteria and Piles; Proposed Rule.\\" Federal Register, . 2019-08-14.EPA. \\"Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline To Initiate Closure.\\" Proposed rule.

In December 2006, TV 2 and MTG announced that they would enter a partnership to launch TV 2 SPORT and its sister channel TV 2 SPORT Xtra (later renamed TV 2 SPORT HD). This channel would replace the Danish version of Viasat Sport 1 (as it was then called). It would also mean that Viasat Sport 2 and 3 would disappear from cable television and TV 2's second channel TV 2 Zulu would broadcast less sport. The original launch of TV 2 SPORT was set to 1 March 2007, but the launch had to be postponed since an investigation by the Danish Competition Authority caused a delay. The Competition Authority gave its permission to the establishment of TV 2 SPORT on 11 April 2007, and later that day the channel began broadcasting. On 8 October 2012, it was announced that MTG would buy TV 2's share of TV 2 SPORT, however the deal did not go through until 19 December 2012 when the Competition Authority approved the deal, on the condition that MTG would abide by certain rules until major football TV rights (Danish Superliga, UEFA Champions League) are renegotiated in 2015. On 7 January 2013, TV3 SPORT 1 began broadcasting and it was announced that an additional channel, TV3 SPORT 2, would be launched on 5 February 2013.

It is currently serving as the executive office of the University of St. Thomas. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Harris County, Texas in 2000, and became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 2001. History The Link‚ÄìLee House is named for John Wiley Link and Thomas Peter Lee, its first owners. The house is located at the corner of Montrose Boulevard and West Alabama Street, now on the St. Thomas University campus in Houston. A monumental portico fronts the neoclassical building, which is clad in brick with terra cotta ornamentation. The Link-Lee Mansion is now part of the University of St. Thomas in Houston Link Family John Wiley Link (1866‚Äì1933) was born in Gallatin, Texas. He completed his law studies at Baylor University, and joined the Texas bar in 1888. He practiced law in Amarillo and Orange, where he was elected mayor in 1905. Link accumulated wealth through the lumber business and finance in east Texas. In 1910, he moved to Houston where he anticipated economic growth sparked by its emerging oil industry. In addition to being the founding chairman of The American General Insurance Company and the second president of The Dr. Pepper Company, he established the Houston Land Corporation while amassing several properties totaling 250 acres near the Houston city limits. He set aside a strip land on which he built the first section of Montrose Boulevard, the main street for his upscale residential subdivision. He planned his own home site on Block 41, fronting the newly paved Montrose Boulevard and West Alabama Street. Sanguinet, Staats, and Barnes designed this Link's home, which was built by Young Contracting Company in 1912. Lee Family Thomas Peter Lee (born March 19, 1871) started as an oil field worker in his native West Virginia and Ohio. Just sixteen when he started work, he relocated to Saratoga, Texas in 1903 to work for the Texas Company. In 1914, he co-founded Farmers Petroleum Company and accepted a post as the firm's president. Lee acquired the house at the end of 1916 for $90,000. Link‚ÄìLee House was the largest single-family residence in Houston at the time with over 10,000 square feet. The main floor included a breakfast room, formal dining room, and music room. There was a full basement, a second floor with five bedroom suites, and a third floor ballroom. After Lee's death, his home remained in the possession of his family until July 9, 1940 when family members, including Mrs. Essie N. Lee, sold the property to the University of St. Thomas for $120,000. At the wishes of all heirs and executors, the college separated the payment into two parts: $6,000 in cash and the remaining $114,000 as a donation, guaranteed by a promissory note dated September 1, 1946, made payable to the William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art in Houston. University of St. Thomas The home, now referred to as the Link-Lee Mansion, and its surrounding land, became the main building of the University of St. Thomas, which still occupies the site today. Originally the building housed the entire university, it now contains the executive offices of the university. While still mostly intact, the mansion has been adapted to accommodate the offices of the president, vice president for Academic Affairs, Dean of Arts and Sciences, vice president for Institutional Advancement, and Alumni Relations. The surrounding patio, porch, and yard of the mansion was utilized each October as part of Neewollah, the university's Halloween party. This tradition ended in 2006 with the construction of the Edward P. White Memorial Plaza, which feature a large granite monolith and fountain. The plaza is the last design of famous architect Philip Johnson. Future plans involve moving the offices out of the mansion and restoring it back to how it looked in 1912. These plans are contingent upon the university purchasing adjacent properties prior to making any such moves.

The line closed on 21 June 1929. It is not to be confused with the Jersey Railway. History 1916 timetable of services The Loi pour l'√©tablissement d'un Chemin de Fer entre la Ville de St.-H√©lier et Gorey was approved on 16 March 1871 (confirmed by Order in Council 19 March 1872), with 68 articles of the projet in the name of the Jersey Eastern Railway Company Limited. The law (repealed by the Statute Law Revision (No. 3) (Jersey) Law, 1966) authorised the railway from Snow Hill in St Helier, to Gorey and from there to St Catherine's Bay in St Martin, although the latter route was never begun. There was no mention of gauge. Article 54 of the projet was most significant in stating that any disagreement with property owners must be resolved by the Royal Court for consideration and decision, and the claimant could not cause work to cease by raising the clameur de haro (as had happened with the Jersey Railway construction). On 15 May 1871, the committee appointed by the States met to consider objections by landowners; the majority were satisfied that they had received fair compensation. The first turf was dug by Mrs Mourant, wife of Edward Mourant, the chairman of the Board of Directors, at a private ceremony on 17 September 1872. The line was opened on 6 August 1873, with a train of six carriages taking the States Members and their wives along the track to Grouville Station in 15 minutes. The official opening of Gorey station was on 25 May 1891, to coincide with Queen Victoria‚Äôs birthday. The journey of just over six miles from St Helier cost 9d (old pence) first class return, 6d second class return. In 1923 the Jersey Motor Transport Company started a bus service carrying passengers all over the Island. The Jersey Eastern Railway tried to counter the fierce competition by running their own bus service in 1926, but this was not much of a success, and declining profits led to termination of both the bus and train services on 21 June 1929. The company itself was liquidated in 1932. Most of the land was sold to adjacent landowners, but part of the route can be seen near Fauvic (at the southeastern tip of the island), where it has been preserved as a footpath.BBC Jersey - Nature - Times, Tides and Towers The Jersey Eastern Railway Terminus Hotel at Snow Hill remains, and is on the Register of Historic Buildings.Jersey Government (website) Route The line began at Saint Helier, with intermediate stations located at Georgetown, Samar√®s, Le Hocq, Pontac, La Rocque and Fauvic, with the eastern terminus in Grouville, originally opposite the Wimbledon Hotel, later extended to Gorey and then to Gorey Pier.

Prandtl, L.: \\"Zur torsion von prismatischen st√§ben\\", Phys. Zeitschr., 4, pp. 758-770 (1903) Love 1944, article 224, page 322. It describes the stress distribution on a long bar in torsion. The cross section of the bar is constant along its length, and need not be circular. The differential equation that governs the stress distribution on the bar in torsion is of the same form as the equation governing the shape of a membrane under differential pressure. Therefore, in order to discover the stress distribution on the bar, all one has to do is cut the shape of the cross section out of a piece of wood, cover it with a soap film, and apply a differential pressure across it. Then the slope of the soap film at any area of the cross section is directly proportional to the stress in the bar at the same point on its cross section. Simply when steel subjected or installed in a structures load distribution from slab to footing Consider a steel element which will allow transfer load through it in a steel molecular are in stress may be normal or shear stress variation steel element trying to resist loads how much stress occurred in length of steel bar or structural element are drawn in contour lines Application to thin-walled, open cross sections While the membrane analogy allows the stress distribution on any cross section to be determined experimentally, it also allows the stress distribution on thin-walled, open cross sections to be determined by the same theoretical approach that describes the behavior of rectangular sections. Using the membrane analogy, any thin-walled cross section can be \\"stretched out\\" into a rectangle without affecting the stress distribution under torsion. The maximum shear stress, therefore, occurs at the edge of the midpoint of the stretched cross section, and is equal to 3T/bt^2, where T is the torque applied, b is the length of the stretched cross section, and t is the thickness of the cross section. It can be shown that the differential equation for the deflection surface of a homogeneous membrane, subjected to uniform lateral pressure and with uniform surface tension and with the same outline as that of the cross section of a bar under torsion, has the same form as that governing the stress distribution over the cross section of a bar under torsion. This analogy was originally proposed by Ludwig Prandtl in 1903.Prandtl, L.: \\"Zur torsion von prismatischen st√§ben\\", Phys. Z., 4, pp. 758-770 (1903). Other applications Prandtl's stretched-membrane concept was used extensively in the field of electron tube (\\"vacuum tube\\") design (1930's to 1960's) to model the trajectory of electrons within a device. The model is constructed by uniformly stretching a thin rubber sheet over a frame, and deforming the sheet upwards with physical models of electrodes, impressed into the sheet from below. The entire assembly is tilted, and steel balls (as electron analogs) rolled down the assembly and the trajectories noted. The curved surface surrounding the \\"electrodes\\" represents the complex increase in field strength as the electron-analog approaches the \\"electrode\\"; the upward distortion in the sheet is a close analogy to field strength.

To do this, \\"rooms\\" of ore are dug out while \\"pillars\\" of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden. Calculating the size, shape, and position of pillars is a complicated procedure, and is an area of active research. The technique is usually used for relatively flat-lying deposits, such as those that follow a particular stratum. Room and pillar mining can be advantageous because it reduces the risk of surface subsidence compared to other underground mining techniques. It is also advantageous because it can be mechanized, and is relatively simple. However, because significant portions of ore may have to be left behind, recovery and profits can be low. Room and pillar mining was one of the earliest methods used, although with significantly more man-power. The room and pillar system is used in mining coal, gypsum, iron, and uraniumPaul, Michael, et al. \\"Mine flooding and water management at underground uranium mines two decades after decommissioning.\\" Proc. IMWA Conference. 2013. ores, particularly when found as manto or blanket deposits, stone and aggregates, talc, soda ash and potash. It has been used worldwide from the Czech Republic to China to the US.  Process = Stage 1‚Äîexploration and development  Planning for the development of room and pillar mines operates in much the same way as other mining methods, and begins with establishing ownership of the mine. Following this, the geology of the mine must be analysed, as this will determine factors like the lifespan of the mine, the production requirements, and the cost to develop and maintain. Next, mine layout should be determined, as factors like ventilation, electrical power, and haulage of the ore must be considered in cost analysis. Due to the non-homogeneous nature of mineral deposits typically mined by room and pillar, mine layout must be mapped very carefully. It is desirable to keep the size and shape of rooms and pillars consistent, but some mines strayed from this formula due to lack of planning and deposit characteristics. Mine layout includes the size of rooms and pillars in the mines, but also includes factors like the number and type of entries, roof height, ventilation, and cut sequence. = Mine layout = General Layout of room and pillar mine Room and pillar mines are developed on a grid basis except where geological features such as faults require the regular pattern to be modified. The size of the pillars is determined by calculation. The load-bearing capacity of the material above and below the material being mined and the capacity of the mined material will determine the pillar size. Random mine layout makes ventilation planning difficult, and if the pillars are too small, there is the risk of pillar failure. In coal mines, pillar failures are known as squeezes because the roof squeezes down, crushing the pillars. Once one pillar fails, the weight on the adjacent pillars increases, and the result is a chain reaction of pillar failures. Once started, such chain reactions can be extremely difficult to stop, even if they spread slowly.S. O. Andros, Coal Mining in Illinois, Illinois Coal Mining Investigations, Bulletin 13, Vol II, No 1, University of Illinois, September 1915. To prevent this from happening, the mine is divided up into areas or panels. Pillars known as barrier pillars separate the panels. The barrier pillars are significantly larger than the \\"panel\\" pillars and are sized to allow them to support a significant part of the panel and prevent progressive collapse of the mine in the event of failure of the panel pillars.  Stage 2‚Äîmining  Traditionally, the act of mining consists of three steps. First, the deposit is \\"undercut\\", where a slot is cut as deep as possible along the bottom of a section of ore. This undercut allows for a manageable pile of rock in later stages. The second step was the drilling and blasting of the section. This creates a pile of ore that is loaded and hauled out of the mine--the final step of the mining process. More modern room and pillar mines use a more \\"continuous\\" method, that uses machinery to simultaneously grind off rock and move it to the surface. Other processes, such as backfill, where discarded tailings are unloaded into mined-out areas, can be used, but are not required. Retreat mining (below) is an example of a process like this. = Retreat mining = Retreat mining is often the final stage of room and pillar mining. Once a deposit has been exhausted using this method, the pillars that were left behind initially are removed, or \\"pulled\\", retreating back towards the mine's entrance. After the pillars are removed, the roof (or back) is allowed to collapse behind the mining area. Pillar removal must occur in a very precise order to reduce the risks to workers, owing to the high stresses placed on the remaining pillars by the abutment stresses of the caving ground. Retreat mining is a particularly dangerous form of mining. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), pillar recovery mining has been historically responsible for 25% of American coal mining deaths caused by failures of the roof or walls, even though it represents only 10% of the coal mining industry. Retreat mining cannot be used in areas where subsidence is not acceptable, reducing profitability. Sometimes retreat mining is not used and the underground space is repurposed as climate controlled storage or office space instead.  Stage 3‚Äîmaintenance and remediation  Many room and pillar mines have been abandoned for as long as 100 years. This drastically increases the risk of subsidence unless properly maintained, however, maintenance does not often occur. Mention of \\"environmental stewardship\\" is often mentioned by mining companies, but no examples of how this is being done can be found. History A Maryland coal mine from 1850 Room and pillar mining is one of the oldest mining methods. Early room and pillar mines were developed more or less at random, with pillar sizes determined empirically and headings driven in whichever direction was convenient.C. M. Young, Percentage of Extraction on of Bituminous Coal with Special Reference to Illinois Conditions, Engineering Experiment Station Bulletin No. 100, University of Illinois, page 130. Room and pillar mining was in use throughout Europe as early as the 13th century, and the United States since the late 18th century. It is still in use throughout the US, but has slowed or stopped entirely in parts of Europe. Coal mining in the United States has nearly always operated with a room and pillar layout, although originally operated with significantly more man-power. Room and pillar mining of gypsum was used in Iowa beginning in 1892, and was phased out of use in 1927 due to low recovery and development of technologies that made surface mining more practical, safe, and cost effective.  Modern use  Modern room and pillar mines can be few and far between. This is due to many factors, including the dangers to miners associated with subsidence, increasing use of other methods with more mechanization, and the decreasing cost of surface mining.  Advantages  Room and pillar mining is not particularly dependent on the depth of the deposit. At particularly deep depths, room and pillar mining can be more cost effective compared to strip mining due to the fact that significantly less overburden needs to be removed. This means that today, room and pillar mining is mostly used for high grade, but small, deep deposits.  Disadvantages  Due to a recovery rate as low as 40% in some cases, room and pillar mining cannot compete in terms of profitability with many modern, more mechanized types of mining such as longwall or surface mining. Abandoned mines have a tendency to collapse. In remote areas, collapses can be dangerous to wildlife, but subsidence of abandoned mines can be hazardous to infrastructure above and nearby.

The compound is an isomer of indole. Its reduced form is isoindoline. The parent isoindole is a rarely encountered in the technical literature, but substituted derivatives are useful commercially and occur naturally. Isoindoles units occur in phthalocyanines, an important family of dyes. Some alkaloids containing isoindole have been isolated and characterized.Heugebaert, Thomas S.

Commun., 1972, 393-395. N-Substituted isoindoles, which are easier to handle, can be prepared by dehydration of isoindoline-N-oxides. They also arise by myriad other methods, e.g., starting from xylylene dibromide (C6H4(CH2Br)2). Structure and tautomerism of 2-H-isoindoles  Unlike indole, isoindoles exhibit noticeable alternation in the C-C bond lengths, which is consistent with their description as pyrrole derivatives fused to a butadiene. In solution, the 2H-isoindole tautomer predominates. It resembles a pyrrole more than a simple imine. The degree to which the 2H predominates depends on the solvent, and can vary with the substituent in substituted isoindoles. :2H-Isoindole (right) is the predominant tautomer relative to 1H-isoindole (left) N-Substituted isoindoles do not engage is tautomerism and are therefore simpler to study.

The road diverges from Dougall Avenue south of Downtown Windsor, travelling northward over the Essex Terminal Railway/CP Rail tracks, before terminating at a turnaround and parking lot at Dieppe Gardens in Windsor's core. The road is 4-lanes for most of its length, narrowing down to two lanes north of Wyandotte Street. Its purpose is to divert traffic from the Ambassador Bridge (via Highway 3/Huron Church Road), by sending it to the Tunnel (Via Dougall Parkway, Dougall Avenue, to the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, along Wyandotte Street to its Canadian terminus at Goyeau Street. Traffic onward into the United States generally continues onto Woodward Avenue, Detroit's \\"Main Street\\", which lies along the same alignment as Ouellette. The road is quite busy, and is mostly used by cars, as trucks longer than 45 feet cannot fit around the curve on the American side of the Detroit Tunnel, and the Ambassador Bridge tends to be clogged.  History  Ouellette Avenue first began as the original alignment of Highway 3 from 1920, terminating at the International Ferry Dock between Ouellette Avenue and Dougall Avenue, in downtown Windsor. This remained until July 10, 1929, when the Ambassador Bridge opened. Highway 3 was re-routed along the newly constructed Huron Church Road to the bridge, and Ouellette Avenue was re- designated as Highway 3A (Windsor). This lasted until 1935, when it was re- designated as Highway 3B (Windsor). In 1962, the City of Windsor re-aligned Ouellette Avenue to flow into Dougall Avenue directly, instead of having Highway 3B traffic head north along Dougall Avenue, then making a short east- bound jog on Tecumseh Road before continuing left (north) on Ouellette Ave. The former alignment remained as Ouellette Avenue, while the new alignment became \\"Ouellette Place\\". Four years later, it was designated as a Connecting Link, enabling Windsor to receive monetary and mechanical/paving assistance in maintaining the road, and to continue to sign it as Highway 3B, should it be downloaded. Though it was officially turned back in 1975, the connecting link status remained in place until January 1, 1998. This was when the connecting link status was repealed, and the road was officially retired as a Provincially maintained highway.  Today  Ouellette Avenue serves as an access to downtown Windsor and to the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. The road is also the main path for the Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival's Parade, and for the Windsor Jaycees Santa Claus Parade.

He was also voted team MVP (by his teammates) and the most Popular Player (by the fans) during his rookie year while playing for the Tampa Bay Rowdies. He spent two seasons in the NASL and four in the Major Indoor Soccer League. He was a member of the U.S. National Team from 1984‚Äì86 and participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics. Thompson earned twelve caps with the U.S. national soccer team. High school and college Thompson spent his early youth in California before moving to Stillwater, Minnesota when he was fourteen. He became a star athlete at Stillwater High School. His high school did not have a soccer team when he moved to Minnesota, so Thompson played football and ran track while playing soccer with local youth clubs. He was an outstanding running back, averaging 8.9 yards per carry over his high school career while breaking over 40 football records at Stillwater High School. Thompson was fast running the 40 yard dash in 4.4 seconds and strong benching over 350 lbs. (he weighed 165 pounds) He earned All State honors and received football athletic scholarship offers from the University of Colorado, University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, numerous Division II schools and all of the Ivy League programs. His biggest claim to fame was his accomplishments during the state semi-final game against Columbia Heights. There was 30 seconds remaining on the clock, Stillwater was losing the game 14-13 and the ball was 37 yards away from the goalpost. Stillwater decided to attempt a field goal. Thompson was the field goal kicker as well. Thompson was successful in making the 37 yard field goal but there was a penalty on the play. The refs moved the ball back 5 yards. Thompson was again successful in kicking a 42-yard field goal to win the game. It was later found out that Thompson completely tore his ACL and meniscus on the fifth play of the game; nevertheless, his final game stats included throwing a touchdown pass, rushing for 125 yards and kicking the game-winning field goal. Thompson also went to the state finals in track his senior year long jumping over 22' and triple jumping nearly 47'. (his first triple jump as a junior in high school was the fifth best ever recorded in the state at the time) While he was one of the best football players to come out of the state of Minnesota, he preferred soccer and chose to attend Indiana University when that school offered him an athletic scholarship to play soccer.http://stillwatergazette.com/articles/2006/01/26/sports/sports12.txt Thompson was voted the Minnesota High School Athlete of the Year when he graduated from Stillwater in 1978. Thompson joined the Hoosiers in 1978. He did not play in 1979 because of a knee injury, but became a regular through the 1980‚Äì1982 seasons. In 1982, he captained Indiana as it ran to the NCAA championship game. In that game, Indiana went up against Duke University and its top defenseman Joe Ulrich. Thompson scored the first goal, but Duke replied and the game ended tied at one all. The game was in its eighth overtime when Ulrich fouled Thompson just outside the box. Thompson replied with a swerving free kick which found the net, giving Indiana its first national title. Thompson would come in second in the balloting for the Hermann Trophy that year, losing to Ulrich. In 2007, Thompson was inducted into the Indiana University Hall of Fame. One of only seven soccer players to be inducted into the IU Hall of Fame. Professional The Los Angeles Lazers of Major Indoor Soccer League selected Thompson with the number one selection in the 1983 MISL Draft. Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League selected Thompson as the first pick in the 1983 NASL college draft. He elected to sign with the Rowdies and was named the 1983 NASL Rookie of the Year after playing thirty games. Following the 1984 NASL season, the league collapsed. After the collapse of the NASL, the Rowdies traded Thompson to the Minnesota Strikers of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). He remained with the Strikers through the 1987‚Äì1988 MISL season before retiring. National and Olympic teams At the end of the 1983 NASL season, Thompson joined the U.S. Olympic team as it prepared for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Thompson played all three games for the U.S. at the Olympics, including scoring the U.S. goal in its 1‚Äì1 tie with Egypt in front of 85,000 people at Stanford Stadium. The U.S. finished the first round at 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 and failed to qualify for the second round.SOCCER; U.S. Out of Medal Race Even before the Olympic games, Thompson had earned his first cap with the U.S. national team in a May 20, 1984 scoreless tie with Italy. He would go on to play a total of 12 times for the full national team between 1984 and 1985, including several qualification matches for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. His last national team game came in the May 31, 1985 debacle in Torrance, California when the U.S. lost to Costa Rica.

Rock discovery In 2003, White purchased of mountain real estate in Cummington, Massachusetts from his aunt for $50,000, giving her the money she needed to enter a nursing home. His original intention was to build his home, but he found the land to be too hard. When he called a surveyor out to inspect the land, the surveyor found that the land was solid Goshen stone, a type of mica schist estimated to be about 400 million years old. Estimates have placed the low estimate of the find at 24 million tons. At current prices (he has been selling the stone for over $100/ton), it is estimated to be worth around $2.5 billion, minus extraction costs.

The average brightness also varies slowly over several years so that the total range is given as magnitude 2.6 ‚Äì 6.0. Since 1995 the average brightness has dropped so that the 140 day variations are now between about magnitude 6 and 8. The variation in light may be caused by a combination of radial pulsations in the star's atmosphere and by dimming from circumstellar dust. L2 Puppis is most likely an asymptotic giant branch star that has passed through the main sequence and is evolving to become a white dwarf. It is shedding mass at the rate of about per year, forming a circumstellar dust disk and bipolar plumes of gas that are thought to be the start of a \\"butterfly\\"-type planetary nebula. It has been calculated that the mass of L2 Puppis is currently about and its original mass was close to about 10 billion years ago. Other calculations give higher masses, for example , and younger ages such as 1.5 billion years. A candidate exoplanet has been found orbiting L2 Puppis every 4.69 years at a distance of 2.43 AU. The mass is highly uncertain, at , and it might just be a dense clump of gas and dust. L2 Puppis has a visual 12th magnitude companion about a minute of arc away.

He is a well known, iconic figure throughout the former USSR, having been on the screen for the greater part of most people's lives. In this he compares with personalities such as Bob Barker or Dick Clark on American television. Game Shows Maslyakov has been working in television since 1964. He has hosted numerous game shows in this time, including ¬´Allo, my ishchem talanty¬ª [Hello, we're looking for talents], ¬´Adresa molodykh¬ª [Addresses of young ones], ¬´Veselye rebyata¬ª [Fun kids], the long-running ¬´A nu-ka, devushki¬ª [Come on, girls], in which young women competed against one another in skills such as cooking, dancing, or milking cows, and its short-lived counterpart for young men, ¬´A nu-ka parni¬ª. He was also the first host (1974) of what subsequently became one of Russia's longest-running game shows, ¬´Chto? Gde? Kogda?¬ª [What? Where? When?]. Maslyakov was the regular host of Soviet coverage of World Festivals of Youth and Students, held in such major world capitals as Sofia, Havana, (East) Berlin, Pyongyang, and Moscow, as well as hosting a number of popular Soviet Eurovision-style lip-synching song competitions over the years. KVN Maslyakov at the opening of Planet KVN Moscow Youth Centre on April 1, 2013 Maslyakov is most famous, however, for his involvement in the game show KVN (Club of the happy and inventive), a game show nearly as long-lived as ¬´Chto? Gde? Kogda?¬ª, in which teams of enthusiastic and clever young people (usually university students) compete against one another in a series of improvised and rehearsed comedic and musical skits and witty repartee (and occasionally cutting-edge politically risque satire and social commentary) in front of a live audience and a jury of stars of stage and screen. KVN went on the air in 1961, and Maslyakov became its host in 1964, while still a student himself. He has remained at the helm ever since, and now runs the production company that owns the show itself and all spinoff rights. Maslyakov is currently the president of the International Union of KVN and the host of all the games of the Major League of KVN as well as of the annual KVN festivals in Sochi and J≈´rmala. Education and awards Maslyakov graduated in 1966 from the Moscow Institute of Transport Engineers and in 1968 he completed Higher Courses for Television Workers. He is a Merited Figure of the Arts of the Russian Federation, 1994 laureate of the Ovation prize, and a member of the Academy of Russian Television. In 2002 he was awarded the highest honor of the Academy of Russian Television, the TEFI For individual contribution to the development of domestic television. In 2006, in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of KVN, the then-president of the Russian Federation conferred the Order of Merit for the Fatherland Grade IV on Maslyakov for a significant contribution to the development of domestic television and many years of creative activity.

Episode 3: Dhruva leaves the palace in search of Lord Shri Vishnu. Goddess Lakshmi pleads with Lord Shri Vishnu to protect Dhruva, and takes matters into her own hands by manifesting as a snake to save the child from a gang of dacoits.

Episode 4: Goddess Parvati, at Goddess Lakshmi's request, protects Dhruva by sending her lion to guard the child from wild beasts. Dhruva asks Narada for further guidance and on his advice, gives up eating and drinking. Lord Shri Vishnu tells Goddess Lakshmi, however, that he cannot come down to the world for just one person. Meanwhile, the king of the devas, Indra, fears Dhruva may ask Lord Shri Vishnu for Indra's throne. Indra sends the apsara Rakshita disguised as Dhruva's mother, but Dhruva does not even notice her. Episode 5: Uttanpada is miserable and Indra's attempts to frustrate Dhruva's penance fail. Dhruva begs Narada for further advice and, obeying his guru's instructions, stops breathing.

Matsya Avatara and the theft of the Vedas (episodes 7-9) Episode 7: Dharti Ma narrates that sage Kashyapa had three wives, Diti, Aditi and Danu, the mothers of the daityas (demons), devas (gods) and danavas (monsters or giants or demons), respectively. Lord Shri Vishnu entrusts the four scriptures, the Vedas, to Brahma, to be passed on to mankind. Hayagriva, a son of Danu, feels this is unfair to demons and determines to keep the Vedas away from humanity. Brahma is worried that mankind is too evil to receive the Vedas, and goes to consult Shiva about purifying the earth first. While Brahma is away, Hayagriva kidnaps the Vedas (who are in the form of four small boys) and imprisons them in his underwater lair. Episode 8: Shiva agrees to flood the earth to destroy all evil life and purify it; Brahma can then create humanity anew and give them the Vedas. While Manu is bathing, a tiny fish swims into his hands and begs for protection. Manu takes it home, but it grows to giant size in a single night and he releases it into the ocean, where he realizes the fish is none other than Lord Shri Vishnu. As Matsya, the fish, Lord Shri Vishnu warns Manu of the coming flood and asks him to save anything important in a boat. Episode 9: Hayagriva decides to destroy the Vedas but Matsya appears first and kills Hayagriva. Manu and Shatarupa gather plants and animals, deciding to save everything rather than having the pride to think they know what is valuable and what is not.

Episode 11: Shukracharya, the danava guru, chides his followers for attacking without a plan. He forms a plan of his own: to ask Lord Shiva for the Sanjeevani Mantra - a mantra that enables one to bring the dead back to life. Lord Indra goes to Lord Shiva to prevent this, but Shukracharya attracts Lord Shiva's attention first and earns the right to attempt Shiva's penance to obtain the mantra: to hang upside down from a tree, without eating, drinking or speaking, and breathing only the smoke of burning leaves, for one year.

Lord Shri Vishnu Bhagwan tells Lord Indra he must churn the ocean to extract amrita, the nectar of immortality. This will make the devas and danava even. The catch is, the devas are not strong enough alone to churn the ocean. Lord Indra must obtain the cooperation of the danava. Episode 15: Lord Indra points out to Shukracharya that when he dies, he won't be able to use the Sanjeevani Mantra on himself and the danava advantage will be lost.

Episode 123: Using the scenes from previous volumes, this episode summarizes Lord Vishnu's Ten Incarnations. The first incarnation was as a fish to protect Manu and to punish the demon Hayagriva who had stolen the four Vedas that Brahma had created for the welfare of mankind. Angered with the slaying of Hayagriva, demon Hiranyaksha kidnapped Mother Earth thus endangering the entire human race. This necessitated Vishnu's third incarnation as a Boar. He killed Hiranyaksha and rescued Mother Earth. The menace of demons was increasing specially after their Guru Shukracharya had gained the precious mantra from Shiva for giving new life to dead demons. To grant immortality to gods, it was decided to derive Elixir by churning the ocean. To raise a mountain from the sea for churning, the Lord Vishnu took the incarnation of a Turtle. To avenge the death of his brother, demon Hiranyakashipu gained a boon from Brahma which made his death almost impossible. He banned the devotion of Vishnu on earth and compelled people, including his son, to worship him. To end his atrocities Lord Vishnu made his son Prahlad as his ardent devotee. Hiranyakashipu used various methods to get his son killed. Lord Vishnu took the incarnation of Narasimha to destroy him. To end the arrogance of King Bali, Lord Vishnu took the Vaman Avtar - His fifth incarnation. When Kings began forgetting their duty as administrator and were closing down hermitages and schools then Lord Vishnu incarnated Himself as Parshuram and then the seventh incarnation as Rama. To relieve the world from the injustice of Kans and Kauravas Lord Vishnu took the eighth incarnation as Lord Krishna. And in recent times, when deception was at its zenith when the priests had spread the evils of superstitions in the society, the Lord Vishnu took the ninth incarnation - of Lord Gautama Buddha - to give a new direction of non-violence to the world. Whereas Balarama is worshiped in southern regions of India as the eight avatar, with Krishna as ninth, in distinction to north India, where Krishna is worshiped as eighth and Balaram is not included as an avatar. The present era is called Kalyug. In Srimad Bhagvad the great Sage Vyasa has said that in the final phase of Kalyug Lord Vishnu shall reincarnate Himself as Kalki. Thus concludes the sacred Vishnupuran. Episode 124: This episode uses several important scenes from Dr. B.R. Chopra's Mahabharat TV serial to depict the importance of women in the Indian mythology. It deals with Rukmini's marriage to Krishna which highlights a woman's right to have a major say in the selection of her life partner. It also covers the story of Subhadra's abduction by Arjuna with the help of Lord Krishna. Episode 125: This last episode also uses material from Mahabharat TV serial. It describes about the boon that was granted by Krishna to Shishupala and the death of Shishupala at Yudhishthira's Rajasuya Yagna at Indraprastha. It also shows the Bhagavad-Gita narration. Krishna drives Arjuna to the middle of the battlefield in his chariot. Arjuna sees the men on the battlefield and tells Krishna, \\"Winning a kingdom after killing one's own kin is too heavy a price to pay. I prefer to be a beggar if this is the price I have to pay for our throne.\\" Krishna's teaching to Arjuna at the battlefield forms the basis of the Bhagavad Gita. Unable to satisfy Arjuna's hopeless conscience, Krishna grants divine eyesight to Arjuna and stuns him with his Vi≈õvar≈´pa (divine manifestation). Arjuna is consoled and enlightened. He understands that the pure seek the spirit while the impure are trapped in Prakriti (Matter). He agrees to do his duty selflessly, lifts his Gandiva bow and prepares to fight the Kauravas.

It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic place of local significance since 1982. The name \\"Glebe House\\" refers to the glebe, an area of land the proceeds of which supported the parish and its minister. The land associated with Glebe House was about 1 square kilometre (250 acres) in size. The Glebe House itself was constructed in 1767 as a Georgian red brick building on a rubble stone foundation. It was to serve rectory for the Reverend John Beardsley, who ministered at Christ Church, Poughkeepsie and Trinity Church in Fishkill and his family in 1767. Since Beardsley was a Loyalist, he and his entire household were forced to flee to New York City in December 1777 to seek the protection of the British during the American Revolutionary War. After 1777, the house and the land passed through many hands. During this time, it housed a public beer garden and later a florist business. In the early 19th century, an addition to the building was made by Peter De Reimer. In 1929, the house and the remainder of the glebe land (now less than 1 acre) were purchased by members of the Dutchess County Historical Society and the Junior League to protect it from demolition. The house was given to the City of Poughkeepsie to be operated jointly by the Dutchess County Historical Society and the Junior League. The Dutchess County Historical Society was involved with the house from 1929 to 2016. Now home to Fall Kill Creative Works.

Rogers was born in Ipswich and was a somewhat isolated youth but determined to build a career in variety. Rogers developed a technically highly proficient ventriloquism act with her ventriloquist figure Shorty Harris, first of all appearing as a supporting act in music hall in the 1950s. Like her contemporary fellow ventriloquist Bobbie Kimber, she began life as a man but underwent gender reassignment surgery on the National Health Service in the early 1960s. This brought her some short- lived notoriety but did not hamper her career. Rogers won acclaim for her appearance in the 1968 review Boys Will be Girls at the Theatre Royal Stratford East and went on to become a highly regarded performer on the UK cabaret circuit. She was the only variety act ever to appear at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. From 1974 onwards she was a regular, though somewhat incongruous, guest on TV on The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. She also appeared on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety show, The Good Old Days. Her cabaret career eventually extended internationally including appearances at Las Vegas and The Magic Castle in Hollywood, and on United States TV. Her work as a magician was always something of a sideline but she was an ingenious developer of magic tricks including illusions for David Copperfield and Paul Daniels. She was an expert on \\"topology\\", the art of creating illusions with shapes, and wrote three standard texts on the subject. She was particularly known for illusions with Borromean Rings. Rogers died in London after a series of strokes. She was survived by her life partner Val Andrews, also a magician. Publications Rogers published a number of magic effects and books, predominantly through specialist magic publisher Martin Breese. These include: * The Little Book of Ventriloquism (c.1948) * Terri Rogers' Star Gate (1985) * Boromian Link (1986) * Wipe Out (1986) * Word of Mind (1986) * Secrets (1986) * More Secrets (1988) * Top Secrets (1998) In addition to these books, Rogers sold several manufactured tricks, including The Key and BlockBuster.

He appeared in court on 14 June.\\"Biti appears in court\\", Sapa-Associated Press (IOL), 14 June 2008. Biti's home was searched by the police on 16 June, although the police did not take anything out of the home.\\"Zim police seeks 'evidence' against Biti\\", The Star (IOL), 17 June 2008, page 5.Basildon Peta and Sapa-Associated Press-AFP, \\"Mugabe threatens another Tsvangirai arrest\\", The Mercury (IOL), 17 June 2008, page 2. His lawyer, Lewis Uriri, said that Biti had been interrogated for a full 24 hours after his arrest; Uriri also said that he would seek an order from the High Court to release Biti on the grounds that he had been held without charge for more than the allowed 48-hour period. Biti again appeared in court on 18 June; however, this hearing was postponed to the next day because the power failed, meaning that the hearing could not be recorded.Hans Pienaar and Xolani Mbanjwa, \\"Mbeki in Bulawayo amid election fears\\", The Star (IOL), 19 June 2008, page 1. He was charged on 19 June. He faced four charges: \\"treason, communicating falsehoods prejudicial to the State, insulting President Mugabe and causing disaffection among the defence forces\\".. Prosecutors argued against granting bail to Biti, noting that the charges against him were so serious that he could be executed. The defence submitted an application to have the charges thrown out, but on 20 June magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe dismissed this application, saying that he believed there was \\"reasonable suspicion that the accused committed the said offence\\". Biti's next court appearance was set for 7 July, and Guvamombe ordered that he remain in custody until then. On 26 June, Biti was granted bail at one trillion Zimbabwean dollars; he was also required to surrender his home's title deeds and to report to the police on a weekly basis.\\"MDC Biti out on bail\\", Sapa-AFP (IOL), 26 June 2008. Biti's lawyers later filed a petition asking for the return of his passport so that he could attend talks between the parties in South Africa, and as a result his passport was returned to him on 9 July, enabling him to go. He led the MDC-Tsvangirai delegation to the talks, which began in Pretoria on 10 July, although according to Tsvangirai the purpose of this was only to set the MDC-Tsvangirai's conditions for participating in the talks, not to actually participate in them.\\"Zimbabwe opposition, gov't talk in South Africa\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 10 July 2008.Nelson Banya, \\"Zimbabwe opposition denies negotiations started\\", Reuters (International Herald Tribune), 10 July 2008. Uriri applied for the removal of Biti's remand on the grounds that a trial date should have been set and the police investigation should have been completed. On 27 August 2008, Chioniso Mutongi, a magistrate in Harare, rejected this request, saying that Biti had not been on remand long enough for its removal to be appropriate.\\"Biti's Application for Removal from Remand Thrown Out\\", The Herald (allAfrica.com), 28 August 2008.

Though he has no known history in financial and economic matters, analysts suggest that Tsavingarai really had no other option considering Biti's position in the MDC. In addition, he is known to drive a hard bargain and could be the best person to deal with the Zanu-PF controlled public service. He was sworn in alongside other Ministers on 13 February 2009 in Harare. Return to legal career On 20 November 2013, Biti announced he would be opening a new law firm. The firm was to specialize in international finance law as well as domestic constitutional issues. Return to politics Biti fell out with Tsvangirai in 2014, resulting in Tsvangirai announcing Biti's expulsion in April 2014. In 2015 Biti joined other disaffected MDC-T members in a breakaway group, MDC-Renewal, becoming its secretary-general. In September 2015, MDC-Renewal launched as a separate party, the People's Democratic Party, and Biti was elected president of the new party. In 2020, Biti criticized a three-member delegation from South African which was sent to investigate human rights abuses when they returned to their country without speaking to opposition groups. In February 2019 he was convicted of contravening the Electoral Act for illegally announcing purported results for the 2018 presidential election in Zimbabwe. He was fined $200.

He is the son of the Green Lantern Abin Sur and nephew of the villain Sinestro by marriage with Sur's sister Arin. Publication history Amon Sur first appeared in Green Arrow (Vol. 3) #24 (June 2003) and was created by writers Judd Winick and Ben Raab, and artist Charlie Adlard. Fictional character biography Amon Sur first appeared in the storyline \\"Black Circle: Urban Knights,\\" a bi- weekly crossover between Green Arrow vol. 3 #23-25 and Green Lantern vol. 3 #162-164. Amon Sur grew up to become the man in charge of the Black Circle crime syndicate. Amon was angry with his deceased father. He felt Abin had abandoned him in favor of the Green Lantern Corps and decided to take his anger out on all Green Lanterns. Amon is eventually stopped by Hal Jordan's successor, Kyle Rayner, and a second-generation Guardian of the Universe named Lianna. Lianna decapitates Amon, but since the head is not a crucial appendage to Ungarans, he survives and eventually regrows a new head. Years later, Amon searches forGreen Lantern (vol. 4) #14-16 (November 2006-January 2007) and has a confrontation with Hal Jordan, who has returned to his Green Lantern role after being freed from the influence of Parallax. Hal defeats the insane youth, but Amon receives a duplicate of Sinestro's ring from the Qwardians and vanishes. After Hal finally takes Abin's body home and buries it, a mysterious yellow light appears in the sky after Hal leaves, presumably Amon arriving to visit his father's grave.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #17 (April 2007) Sinestro Corps Amon Sur is soon recruited by the Sinestro Corps and was chosen to represent Space Sector 2814. The Sinestro Corps originally tried to recruit Batman for the role, but his strong sense of will and previous contact with a Green Lantern ring allows him to fight its influence.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #18-20 (March, April 2007) When the Sinestro Corps invades Earth, Amon Sur is at first delighted. However, upon learning and witnessing that the Green Lantern Corps had now been authorized to use lethal force, he becomes fearful and flees.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #21-25 (July‚ÄìDecember 2007) After the war, Amon Sur is found by a contingent of Green Lanterns on the planet Varva, having murdered deceased Lantern Ke'Haan's family. Amon declares he will surrender peacefully and elaborates that his motive is that other Yellow Lanterns, still on the run, will then learn what he did and murder the families of other fallen Lanterns. To prevent this, Ke'Haan's close friend and Lantern Laira executes him. His ring leaves him after his death and heads for the planet Earth.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #26 (December 2007) Hal Jordan and John Stewart stop the ring from recruiting the villain known as the Scarecrow. The ring is destroyed by the Corps' leaders, the Guardians. Amon's body is sent to Oa. When Laira realizes that her friends believe she committed murder, she grows enraged and incinerates Amon's body to prevent any chance of resurrection.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #27 (January 2008) Blackest Night During the Blackest Night storyline, Amon is reanimated as a Black Lantern. He and other reanimated Sinestro Corpsmen accost Sinestro at the home of the Star Sapphires.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #45 (August 2009) The acidic Sinestro Corpsman Slushh is briefly able to stop Amon engulfing him in Slushh's goo which causes Amon's ring to come off. However, another ring quickly flies onto the finger of his skeletal remains. Only the combined attack of Hal Jordan and members of the Indigo Tribe is able to cripple and destroy him.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #46 (September 2009) Powers and abilities Due to his Ungaran physiology, Amon can naturally regenerate most of his limbs, even his head. As member of the Sinestro Corps, he uses a yellow power ring built on Qward. The rings can create objects based on the wielders own thoughts as well as provide flight and force field protection. The power rings are fueled by fear instead of willpower. The yellow rings are charged by Manhunter androids that have yellow power batteries built into themselves, which in turn are connected to a large yellow Power Battery based on Qward. The rings have no known weaknesses, unlike a Green Lantern power ring's previous vulnerability to yellow. Also, the yellow rings are not restricted from killing sentient beings as the Green Lantern's power rings were, although it is revealed later that blue rings can deplete yellow rings quickly and indigo tribesman can redirect its energy. As a Yellow Lantern, Amon is an excellent intimidator, his ability to instill fear in others being what led to his recruitment to the Sinestro Corps. However, unlike his father, Amon is a coward, ironic as he wields the power of fear. He initially attacked the Green Lanterns believing that they could only attack him, but once he realized they could kill, he fled in terror. As a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Amon wields a black power ring. It too can provide flight and can create constructs out of black energy. The ring allows Amon's corpse to identify when a person is feeling one of the seven colored emotions. At that moment, a Black Lantern can then remove that person's heart, thereby supplying the entire Black Corps with a .01% power boost. In other media=Video games * Amon Sur appears in the video game Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters (set in the same continuity as the live-action movie) voiced by Steven Blum. He attends his father's funeral on Oa, expressing gratitude that his father met his successor before he died. Sometime after the funeral, the Manhunters attack Oa. However, Amon is later revealed to have betrayed the Corps to the Manhunters as part of a plan to 'avenge' himself against the Corps as he was angry that his father's ring was passed to a 'primitive' like Hal Jordan rather than himself, providing the Manhunters with the chance to gain access to the yellow fear energy that the Guardians had kept contained in a secret vault to give them the power to destroy the Corps. Despite wielding a staff empowered by the yellow energy, Amon Sur is finally defeated by Jordan in a final attack on Oa. * Amon Sur appears in DC Universe Online.

It was variously payable in money, labour, grain or stock and benefited the colonial authorities in four related ways: it raised money; it supported the currency (see chartalism); it broadened the cash economy, aiding further development; and it forced Africans to labour in the colonial economy. Households which had survived on, and stored their wealth in cattle ranching now sent members to work for the colonialists in order to raise cash with which to pay the tax. The colonial economy depended upon black African labour to build new towns and railways, and in southern Africa to work in the rapidly developing mines. South Africa By 1908 the following hut taxes were imposed in southern Africa: * In Natal, under Law 13 of 1857, 14 shillings per hut occupied by natives. Natives that lived in European style houses with only one wife were exempt from the tax. * In the Transkei, 10 shillings per hut. * In the Cape Colony, various forms of the \\"house duty\\" had existed since the 1850s. The tax was legally applicable to all house-owners in the Cape, regardless of race or region, but was only partially enforced, especially in rural areas. A full and universally applicable house tax was imposed in 1870 (Act 9 of 1870), and was more fully enforced, due to the government's severe financial difficulties at the time.For houses valued under ¬£100, five shillings were levied; for houses valued between ¬£100 and ¬£500, ten shillings were levied; for houses valued between ¬£500 and ¬£1,000, twenty shillings were levied; and for every additional ¬£500 above, an additional ten shillings were added to the tax amount. The highly unpopular tax was terminated in 1872 (Act 11 of 1872), but a new and higher duty was applied by the Sprigg government during the wars of 1878, when government expenditure was extremely high. The Cape's most controversial \\"hut tax\\" was established under Act 37 of 1884, and specified 10 shillings per hut with exclusions for the elderly and infirm. It was repealed under Act 4 of 1889. Zimbabwe In Mashonaland, now part of Zimbabwe, hut tax was introduced at the rate of ten shillings per hut in 1894. Although authorized by the Colonial Office in London, the tax was paid to the British South Africa Company, the agent of colonial government in the area. Coinciding with confiscations of cattle, the introduction of forced labour and a series of natural disasters, the tax probably contributed to the Shona part of the rebellion against the colonialists in 1896, known as the First Chimurenga or Second Matabele War. Other countries The tax was also used in Uganda and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). In Sierra Leone it sparked the Hut Tax War of 1898 in the Ronietta district in which substantial damage was sustained to the establishments of the Home Missionary Society. The damage sustained by the Society led to an international tribunal over Great Britain's responsibility, brought by the US on behalf of the Home Missionary Society. Liberia also implemented a hut tax, which in one case led to a Kru revolt in 1915.President Arthur Barclay (1904-1912): External and internal threats to Americo-Liberian rule. liberiapastandpresent.org.

Lyft, Inc. develops, markets, and operates a mobile app, offering vehicles for hire, motorized scooters, a bicycle-sharing system, and food delivery. The company is based in San Francisco, California and operates in 644 cities in the United States and 12 cities in Canada. With a 30% market share, Lyft is the second-largest ridesharing company in the United States after Uber. The legality of ridesharing companies by jurisdiction varies; in some areas they have been banned and are considered to be illegal taxicab operations. Product overview Lyft provides basic vehicle insurance. Riders must download the Lyft mobile app to their smartphone, sign up, enter a valid phone number, and enter a valid form of payment (either a credit card, Lyft Gift card, or link to an Apple Pay, Google Wallet, or PayPal account). Once the trip is completed, funds are debited from the funding source. Car rides Once their account is set up, passengers can request a ride from a nearby driver. Once confirmed, the app shows the driver's name, ratings by past passengers, and photos of the driver and car. Drivers and passengers can add personal information to their profiles about their hometown, music preferences, and other details to encourage drivers and passengers to converse during the ride. After the ride is over, the rider is given the opportunity to provide a tip to the driver, which is also billed to the rider's payment method. Depending on the location, Lyft offers various service levels including shared rides with other passengers traveling in the same general direction (suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic), private rides, or larger or luxury vehicles. Scooters Lyft scooter Lyft scooters cost US$1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute to ride. Driver requirements * Drivers must undergo background checks including Department of Motor Vehicles, sex offender registries in the United States, and personnel-type criminal background checks. The criminal background check goes back seven years and includes national and county-level databases, as well as national sex offender registries. * Drivers must be 21 years or older and have had a driver's license for more than one year. * Lyft has a zero-tolerance drug and alcohol policy. Ratings After a ride is completed, drivers and passengers are given the opportunity to rate each other on a scale of one to five stars. Any driver averaging a low rating by a passenger will not be matched with that passenger again. Lyft does not allow passengers to know their rating. The ratings establish the reputations of both drivers and passengers within the network. Rental cars In August 2020, Lyft began its partnership with rental car company Sixt in order to let users access rental cars through the \\"Rentals\\" tab in their app. Most of the rental cars are owned and operated by Sixt, a predominantly European company (German-owned) with 85 locations in the US. For each car rental made through the app, Lyft will receive a commission. The program began as Lyft Rentals in 2019 with Lyft owning and operating its own rental fleet in Los Angeles and San Francisco. History A Lyft vehicle in Santa Monica, California, with the original grill-stache branding, since retired Lyft was launched in the summer of 2012 by computer programmers Logan Green and John Zimmer as a service of Zimride, a long-distance intercity carpooling company they founded in 2007. Green had the inspiration for Zimride after sharing rides from the University of California, Santa Barbara campus to visit his girlfriend in Los Angeles. He had used Craigslist‚Äôs ride boards but wanted to eliminate the anxiety of not knowing the passenger or driver. When Facebook opened its API to third-party developers, Green said he thought \\"Here‚Äôs the missing ingredient.\\" Zimride linked drivers and passengers through the Facebook Connect application. By using Facebook profile information, student drivers and passengers could learn about each other. Zimride eventually became the largest carpool company in the United States. Green was introduced to John Zimmer through a mutual friend and the pair initially met on Facebook. The company name came from the country Zimbabwe, where, during a trip in 2005, Green observed locals sharing minivan taxis. Zimride launched at Cornell University, where, after six months, the service had signed up 20% of the campus. In May 2013, the company officially changed its name from Zimride to Lyft. The change from Zimride to Lyft was the result of a hackathon that sought a means of daily engagement with its users, instead of once or twice a year. In July 2013, Lyft sold Zimride to Enterprise Holdings, the parent company of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, to enable the company to focus exclusively on the growth of Lyft. Whereas Zimride was focused on college campuses, Lyft launched as a ridesharing company for shorter trips within cities. Lyft became known for the large pink furry mustaches drivers attached to the front of their cars. Riders were also encouraged to sit in the front seat and fist bump with drivers upon meeting. In November 2014, the company distanced itself from the fist bump. In January 2015, Lyft introduced a small, glowing plastic dashboard mustache it called a \\"glowstache\\" as an alternative to the large fuzzy mustaches on the front of cars. The transition was to help overcome the resistance of some riders to arrive at destinations, such as business meetings, in a car with a giant mustache. In December 2016, Lyft introduced a color-changing dashboard indicator called \\"Amp.\\" In 2013, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee proclaimed July 13 as Lyft Day. In April 2014, Lyft launched in 24 new U.S. cities in 24 hours, bringing its total to 60 U.S. cities. In April 2014, Lyft hired two lobbying firms, TwinLogic Strategies, and Jochum Shore & Trossevin, to address the regulatory barriers and opposition it had received since its launch. Due to regulatory hurdles in New York City, the company altered its business model when establishing Lyft on the East Coast of the United States. Lyft's launch in New York City occurred on the evening of July 25, 2014, and, in accordance with the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and the approval of the Manhattan Supreme Court, only drivers registered with the TLC were permitted to drive Lyft-branded vehicles in New York City. In August 2014, the company introduced a shared ride concept, which provides cheaper fares. In September 2015, Lyft announced a relocation of its customer service operations to Nashville and mentioned that a full relocation would be possible in the future from San Francisco. In December 2015, Lyft became the first ridesharing company allowed to pick up passengers at Los Angeles International Airport. In May 2016, Lyft began offering a service to let clients schedule rides up to 24-hours in advance. In November 2016, Lyft began offering riders the ability to make multiple stops during a trip. In January 2017, the company announced its 160 millionth ride. In January 2017, Lyft announced it would add 100 U.S. cities, bringing its total to 300 U.S. cities served. In December 2017, Lyft expanded into Canada, with operations in the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Ontario and Ottawa. In July 2017, the company announced that the Walt Disney World Resort \\"Minnie Van\\" service will be powered by Lyft. Users staying at select Walt Disney World Resort hotels are given the option to hail a \\"Minnie Van\\" via the Lyft app. A Minnie Van, a Chevrolet Traverse with Minnie Mouse inspired exterior theming, driven by a Walt Disney World Cast Member can take guests to and from any destination within the Walt Disney World Resort for a flat fee of $20 per ride. Lyft Founder John Zimmer said of the partnership \\"Playing a part in a family‚Äôs experience at the most magical place on earth is a dream come true.\\" In March 2018, Lyft partnered with Allscripts to create a platform allowing healthcare providers to arrange rides for patients who lack transportation to appointments. The service would be available to 2,500 hospitals, 180,000 physicians, and approximately 7 million patients. In September 2018, Lyft launched a fleet of electric scooters in Denver. In November 2018, Lyft acquired Motivate, a bicycle-sharing system and the operator of Capital Bikeshare and Citi Bike. The company also announced plans to add 28,000 Citi Bikes and expand its service. In December 2018, Lyft launched additional scooter fleets in Arlington County, Virginia, Atlanta, Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, San Diego, Santa Monica, California and Washington, D.C.. In March 2019, Lyft became the first ride- sharing company to IPO raising $2.34 billion at a valuation of $24.3 billion. The company set aside some shares to be given to long-time drivers. In July 2019, the company's Lyft Entertainment division received an Emmy nomination for its co-production of Billy on the Street. In July 2019, Lyft added real- time public transport and subway information for New York City, amidst battles with the city. In December 2019, Lyft launched in Vancouver. In April 2020, Lyft laid off 982 employees and furloughed an additional 288 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The company continued to offer scooters for rent in San Francisco, while Miami government asked Lyft to halt operations. Self- driving car research In 2012, Green wanted to pitch investors on self- driving cars as part of Lyft's future offering. Green envisioned a few big networks of self-driving cars, similar to AT&T; and Verizon. In January 2016, Lyft announced an autonomous car partnership with General Motors. On May 5, 2016, Lyft and General Motors announced, as part of their partnership, that it planned to begin testing self-driving cars within the next year. On June 6, 2017, Lyft announced a new partnership with Boston-based autonomous self- driving car start-up NuTonomy to eventually put autonomous, on-demand vehicles on the road. In September 2017, Lyft partnered with Ford Motor Company to develop and test autonomous vehicles. In March 2018, Lyft partnered with GoMentum Station to test its self-driving technology. On March 14, 2018, Lyft partnered with Magna International to co-fund, develop, and manufacture autonomous vehicle systems to produce self driving technology that will be available to all car manufacturers. In October 2018, Lyft acquired Blue Vision Labs, a London-based augmented reality startup, for $72 million. This expertise is expected to help autonomous cars to extract useful information from street-level images. Criticism=Unwanted text messages In November 2018, Lyft settled a class action suit filed in 2014 alleging that the company had sent large numbers of unwanted commercial text messages. In addition to $4 million in payments to consumers, the plaintiffs sought $1 million in legal fees. Sexual assault lawsuits More than 34 women sued Lyft in the United States alleging that they were raped or assaulted by Lyft drivers, and that the company did not do enough to keep them safe and that Lyft attracts drivers that plan to prey on vulnerable women. Many women claim that, even after they reported their assault to Lyft, the company ignored their report and continued to allow the assailants to drive with Lyft.

Whereas a graphical user interface (GUI) relies upon the sense of sight, a TUI enables not only the sense of touch to innervate and activate computer-based functions, it also allows the user, particularly those with visual impairments, an added level of interaction based upon tactile or Braille input.  Technology  Generally, the TUI requires pressure or presence with a switch located outside of the printed paper. Not to be confused with electronic paper endeavors, the TUI requires the printed pages to act as a template or overlay to a switch array. By interacting with the switch through touch or presence, an action is innervated. The switching sensor cross-references with a database. The database retains the correct pathway to retrieve the associated digital content or launch the appropriate application. TUI icons may be used to indicate to the reader of the printed page what action will occur upon interacting with a particular position on the printed page. Turning pages and interacting with new pages that may have the same touch points as previous or subsequent pages, a z-axis may be used to indicate the plane of activity. Z-axis can be offset around the boundary of the page. When the unique z-axis is interacted with, x,y-axis can have identical touch points as other pages. For example, 1,1,1 indicates a z-axis of 1 (page 1) and the x,y-axis is 1,1. However, turning the page and pressing a new z-axis, say page 2, and then the same x,y-axis content position as page 1, gains the following coordinate structure: 2,1,1. An integrated circuit (IC) is located either within the printed material or within an enclosure that cradles the printed material. This IC receives a signal when a switch is innervated. The firmware located within the IC communicates via Universal Serial Bus (USB) either connected to a cable, or using a wireless protocol adapter to a reference database that can reside on media within a computer or appliance. Upon receipt of the coordinate structure from the firmware, the database correlates the position with a pre-determined link or pathway to digital content or execution command for an application. After correlating the link with the pathway, a signal is sent to retrieve and render the terminal of the path.  Implications for use  Those with special requirements can use touch with fingers or pointer to gain access to the digital environment. Typing, currently a traditional method for accessing the digital world, can be replaced for users who are missing fingers or are not capable of typing. Touching a link on printed paper takes advantage of the ubiquitous presence of printed paper while it removes barriers of entry to the digital world. Further, removing the need to type pathways removes errors from the entry process, potentially protecting companies and organizations that have potential users going to a cybersquatting site due to a misspelling. Typing is also time consuming. A touch interface provides a reduction in time to get where the reader wants to go in the digital world. The coupling of printed advertising with online advertising is promising. A reader can touch a printed advertisement and connect directly to the online experience provided by the advertiser. This can include initiating a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Instant Messaging (IM), or Electronic Mail (e-mail) by simply touching the page. Further, electronic commerce (e-commerce) transactions can be initiated and completed with the TUI. This type of interaction can also exist in the Television Commerce (tcommerce) space with a magazine, catalog, or television guide. The TUI technology applied to the printed world serves to converge the printed world with the digital world. This provides an alternative to the either print or digital paradigm shift currently experienced by today's users. It also serves to facilitate the vast majority of the world's peoples to a linguistic and culturally non-specific experience that can provide an on-ramp to the digital world.  Educational mandate  In the United States, legislation took effect in December 2006, that requires educational publishers in the K-12 education industry to provide a National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS). In essence, educational publishers must provide an inclusive experience to those students who are blind. If they are unable to provide this experience, they are required to provide the digital content source files to a clearing house that will convert the materials into an accessible experience for the student. The TUI has the promise of enabling the publishers to maintain control of their content while providing an inclusive, tactile, or Braille experience to students who are visually impaired. Further, using a Braille approach may serve to help enhance Braille literacy while meeting the mandates of NIMAS.

She is best remembered for her association with the composer George Frideric Handel, in whose operas Strada sang. Career After an initial career in Italy that included performances at Venice ‚Äî in Vivaldi's opera La verit√† in cimento (1720) ‚Äî Milan, and Livorno, Strada moved to London in 1729 to sing for Handel after the composer engaged her for his operas. She made her d√©but as Adelaida in Lotario and was prima donna in all his operas and oratorios until 1737. She sang in a minimum of 24 of Handel's operas and the opera-ballet Terpsicore, a new prologue to a revision of Il pastor fido. Her roles included Angelica in Orlando, the title role in Partenope, Elmira in Sosarme, Thusnelda in Arminio, and Ariadne in Giustino, and the title role of Atalanta. Strada was the only singer of Handel's company who did not defect to the rival Opera of the Nobility in 1733, and in 1732 had turned down the opportunity to sing for Giovanni Bononcini. She left London, however, in 1738 and returned to Italy, where she sang at Naples and Turin before her retirement to Bergamo.Grove Contemporary evaluations 18th-century music historian Charles Burney described Strada thus: Further evidence of Strada's unusual ugliness is provided by Mrs Pendarves ‚Äî formerly known as Mary Granville and later Mrs Delany ‚Äî a close friend of Handel. Poet and librettist Paolo Rolli described her as \\"a copy of Faustina with a better voice and better intonation, but without her charm and brio\\". Her Handel parts reveal her vocal range to have been two octaves during the first part of her career, and the dramatic range required by these roles is varied. While in Naples during the first part of her career, Strada married theatre manager and librettist Aurelio del P√≤, reputedly because he owed her a large sum of money and married her as a substitute for payment.

Bro Gwened is marked in shades of purple. The flag of the former realm. The flag of the former county. Gwened, Bro-Gwened (Standard ) or Vannetais () is a historic realm and county of Brittany in France. It is considered part of Lower Brittany.\\"AM\\". \\"Gwened (Vannes/Vannetais)\\" in Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Vol. I, p. 860\\\\. ABC-CLIO (Sta. Barbara), 2006. Bro- Gwened was an early medieval principality or kingdom around Vannes in Armorica (Brittany), lasting from around 490 to around 635. It was peopled by Christianized Britons fleeing the Saxon invasions of Britain, who displaced or assimilated the remaining pagan Veneti Gauls. Its bishop and (usually) court was at Gwened, the site of the former Roman settlement of Darioritum and the present French city of Vannes. Today its territories are included within the modern French department of Morbihan. Name The Breton placename ' () initially meant a tribe,Baring-Gould, pp. 91-92. but came to signify its territory as well. The standard Breton form of the name mutates Gwened, the Breton name for Vannes, while the local dialect leaves it unchanged as \\"Bro- Gwened\\". The modern French name derives from adjectival form of Vannes. Both ' and ' reflect separate developments of the Latin ', the Romans' name for the Gaulish tribe in the area. (It is unrelated to the Welsh realm and county of Gwynedd, which developed from Latin '.) The historic realm was also known as Bro Erec (, \\"land of Gwereg\\") or Bro Waroch (from the gallicisation of the same name) or by numerous variant spellings, although it is unclear whether the namesake Gwereg was Waroch I or II. History The land was allegedly founded by Caradog Strongarm. In the early 6th century, Macliau served as one of the earliest bishops of Vannes prior to usurping his nephew's inheritance in neighboring Cornouaille. He may have also been king of BroerecFord, David Nash. \\"King Tewdwr Mawr\\" at Early British Kingdoms. 2001. Accessed 1 Dec 2014. or simply the refugee guest of Conmor.Baring-Gould, Sabine.

Major settlements at this time included Gwened (Vannes) and Lokmaria (Locmaria). In the mid-7th century, Bro Gwened was united with Domnonia under its king Saint Judica√´l, who was descended from a daughter of Waroch. Domnonia's rulers thenceforth reigned as the high kings of Brittany, with Bro Gwened forming part of their lands. Dialect A map of the dialects of Brittany The dialect of Gwened's present inhabitants is known in Breton as ' and in French as '. It is distinct from that of the other regions of Brittany to the point of near unintelligibility.Kergoat, Lukian. \\"Breton Dialects\\" in Celtic Culture, Vol. I, pp. 250 ff. A primary distinction is that the Gwened dialect has paralleled Gaelic in developing earlier into rather than ; , meanwhile, has disappeared completely rather than merge with as in Leon although there are certain parts of Gwened (e.g. the city Baud) where it is still used as an initial mutation of d and t and sometimes in the middle and end of a word as a retainment of Middle Breton or Œ∏ where the other dialects substituted d or z (e.g. in hiddi√π [hiÀê√∞iw] (\\"today\\") which would be hiziv [hiÀêziw] or hidiv [hiÀêdiv] in the other dialects (cf. Welsh heddiw [h…õ√∞…™uÃØ])). The dialect also has a tendency to close vowels, places stress on the final syllables of words (as in French and Middle Breton), rather than on the penultimate syllable (as in other Breton dialects and Welsh), and (like English) has completely lost its original 2nd person singular pronoun.

Though this state is often exhibited in young adolescence, people of any age may harbor a fantasy of an imaginary audience.  Early history  David Elkind coined the term \\"imaginary audience\\" in 1967. The basic premise of the topic is that people who are experiencing it feel as though their behavior or actions are the main focus of other people's attention. It is defined as how willing a child is to reveal alternative forms of themselves. The imaginary audience is a psychological concept common to the adolescent stage of human development. It refers to the belief that a person is under constant, close observation by peers, family, and strangers. This imaginary audience is proposed to account for a variety of adolescent behaviors and experiences, such as heightened self-consciousness, distortions of others' views of the self, and a tendency toward conformity and faddisms. This act stems from the concept of ego-centrism in adolescents.Imaginary audience behavior in children and adolescents. Developmental Psychology, 15(1), 38./> Elkind studied the effects of imaginary audience and measured it using the Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS). The results of his research showed that boys were more willing than girls to express different sides of themselves to an audience. This apprehension from girls has given rise to further research on the value of privacy to girls. Imaginary audience influences behavior later in life in regards to risky behaviors and decision- making techniques. A possibility is that imaginary audience is correlated with a fear of evaluation or self-representation effects on self-esteem.  Duration  The phenomenon stems from egocentrism and is closely related to another topic called 'personal fable'. (Personal Fable involves a sense of \\"I am Unique.\\") Imaginary audience effects are not a neurological disorder, but more a personality or developmental stage of life. It is not aroused by a life event; rather it is a part of the developmental process throughout adolescence. It is a natural part of the process of developing a healthy understanding of one‚Äôs relationship with the world. Most people will eventually gain a more realistic perspective on the roles they play in their peer groups as they mature. This natural developmental process can lead to high paranoia about whether the adolescent is being watched, if they are doing a task right and if people are judging them. Imaginary audience will likely cease before adolescence ends, as it is a huge part of personality development. Imaginary audience can be as simple as having to change multiple times in the morning because the adolescent still feels unsatisfactory about arriving at a destination about his/her appearance even though he/she will appear the same as everyone else. The number of adolescents who experience an imaginary audience effect cannot be described with any sort of statistics because an imaginary audience is experienced in all adolescents. According to Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist known for his epistemological studies with children, every child experiences imaginary audience during the preoperational stage of development. He also stated that children will outgrow this stage by age 7 but as we know now this stage lasts much longer than that. Piaget also said imaginary audience happens because young children believe others see what they see, know what they know, hear what they hear, and feel what they feel.Egocentrism in adolescence. Child Development, volume 38(4), 1025-1034./> The extremes to which adolescents experience an imaginary audience, however, varies from child to child. Some children are considered to be more \\"egocentric\\" than others and experience more of an extreme imaginary audience or have more of an elaborate personal fable. Therefore, children then subconsciously put more value on the idea that everyone cares about what they are doing at all times. This is very common in adolescents during this level of development as the child is going through Erik Erikson's identity vs. identity confusion.The imaginary audience, self-consciousness, and public individuation in adolescence. Journal of Personality, volume 62(2), 219-238./>The social reality of the imaginary audience: A grounded theory approach. Adolescence, volume 38(150), 205+./> The child is struggling to figure out their identity and formulating congruent values, beliefs, morals, political views, and religious views. So, on top of experiencing an identity moratorium in which they are exploring different identities, children feel they are constantly being watched or evaluated by those around them. This leads to intense pressure being placed on the child and may also influence later self-esteem.Egocentrism in adolescence. Child Development, volume 38(4), 1025-1034./>  Examples  Examples of imaginary audience: A teen that is affected by imaginary audience might be self-conscious and may worry about what other people think of them. They may change their clothes constantly before leaving the house to make sure they are presentable for everybody that is watching them. They may also spend extra time on make-up and hair to better appeal to the audience they feel they need to impress. A teen may also change their wardrobe to match \\"trends\\" that start. They may also believe that they are better than everyone else and everyone is constantly looking at them and judging, feeling the need to look \\"perfect\\". A teen who has a pimple on their face will think that everyone will notice and that it is covering half of their face. (This is one very common example of imaginary audience.) In reality, only a small percentage of those people have any interest in a person‚Äôs activities, and a maturing worldview will usually reduce the impression that this imaginary audience exists. Some people, however, maintain this misapprehension well into their adult years.  Studies  Gerald Adams and Randy Jones conducted a study to test imaginary audience behavior. They tested total of 115 male and female adolescents between the ages of 11 to 18 using an empathy scale, social sensitivity scale, and a measure of social desirability. They stated Imaginary audience is seen most in teens going through puberty where their bodies are changing rapidly and they are concerned with how everyone is viewing their change. The relationship between age, imaginary audience behavior and self-reported concerns about body image during adolescence questions certain assumptions underlying the development of the Imaginary Audience Behavior scale.Imaginary audience behavior: A validation study.

History The party was established in January 1966 at a meeting of chiefs in Espiritu Santo convened by Chief Buluk of Big Bay. The first territory-wide political movement in the New Hebrides, by 1969 it was estimated to have around 10,000 members (around one in eight of the population), mostly in the north of the territory.\\"Chief President Moses\\": Man with a message for 10,000 New Hebrideans, Pacific Islands Monthly, July 1969, pp23‚Äì25 The name 'Nagriamel' was taken from combining the names of two plants, nagria (a croton) and mel (a cycas). Soon after its establishment, Jimmy Stevens became involved with the party after offering to sell guns to the chiefs. He used much of the funds donated to the party to build an agricultural complex in Vanafo. The party called for the return of all European-owned land that had not been used for agricultural development, It also held the view that the New Hebrides was not ready for independence and the modernization it would bring, though the party was reputedly manipulated by anti-independence French factions and the Phoenix Foundation. In the 1975 elections, the party won two of the 29 seats in the new Assembly. As the independence movement gathered momentum after 1975, led by the more Anglo- centric Walter Lini and the Vanua'aku Pati, Nagriamel sought to delay the end of British‚ÄìFrench condominium. With backing from the Phoenix Foundation, Nagriamel declared the independence of the 'Republic of Vemerana' on Santo on the eve of independence in 1980. Vanua'aku Party and Papua New Guinean soldiers quashed the new state weeks later. Reprisals against Nagriamel supporters spread throughout the northern islands. Following independence, the party contested the 1983 elections, winning one seat, taken by Harry Karaeu. This seat was lost in the 1987 elections, but the party won a seat again in the 1991 elections. The party retained its single seat in the 1995 elections, but lost their parliamentary representation in the 1998 elections. It regained a seat in the 2008 elections, with Havo Moli elected in Malo/Aore.Nagriamel movement still has strongholds support: Patunvanu Daily Post, 2 January 2016 Moli was subsequently appointed Minister for Agriculture. In the 2012 elections the party won three seats, with Moli joined in parliament by Samsen Samson and John Lum. It retained all three seats in the 2016 elections.

Development  A later DB 610 \\"power system\\", similar in design and appearance to the DB 601-based DB 606 powerplant for the He 119. Design was begun in the late summer of 1936. A notable feature of the aircraft was the streamlined fuselage, most likely as an evolutionary descendant of the 1932-vintage Heinkel He 70 record-setting single-engined mailplane design, but without the He 70's protruding canopy-enclosed crew accommodation existing anywhere along the exterior. Instead, the He 119's forward fuselage featured an extensively glazed cockpit forming the nose itself, heavily framed with many diagonally braced windows immediately behind the propeller spinner's rear edge.

The DB 606 was installed just behind the aft cockpit wall, near the center of gravity, with an enclosed extension shaft passing through the centerline of the extensively glazed cockpit to drive a large four-blade variable-pitch airscrew in the nose. An evaporative cooling system was used on the V1, with the remaining prototypes receiving a semi-retractable radiator directly below the engine to augment cooling during take-off and climb. Only eight prototypes were completed and the aircraft did not see production, mainly because of the shortages of DB 601 \\"component\\" engines to construct the DB 606 \\"power systems\\" they formed. The first two prototypes were built as land planes, with retractable landing gear. The third prototype (V3) was constructed as a seaplane with twin floats. This was tested at the Erprobungsstelle Travem√ºnde military seaplane test facility on the Baltic coast, and was scrapped in 1942 at Heinkel's factory airfield in the estuarine Rostock-Schmarl community, then known as Marienehe. On 22 November 1937, the fourth prototype (V4) made a world class-record flight in which it recorded an airspeed of 505 km/h (314 mph), with a payload of 1,000 kg (2,205 lb), over a distance of 1,000 km (621 mi). The four remaining prototypes were completed during the spring and early summer of 1938, the V5 and V6 being A-series production prototypes for the reconnaissance model, and the V7 and V8 being B-series production prototypes for the bomber model. These four aircraft were three-seaters with a defensive armament of one MG 15 machine gun in a dorsal position, V7 and V8 having provision for a normal bombload of three 250 kg (551 lb) bombs or maximum bombload of 1,000 kg (2,205 lb). V7 and V8 were sold to Japan in May 1940, and extensively studied; the insights thus gained were used in the design of the Yokosuka R2Y. The remaining prototypes served as engine test-beds, flying with various prototype versions of the DB 606 and DB 610 (twinned DB 605s) and the strictly-experimental DB 613 (twinned DB 603).

He was also a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic soccer team and U.S. national team. Kapp as a youth played for the New York-based Kolping Soccer Club and Blau-Weiss Gottschee. Kapp attended the University of Connecticut from 1977 to 1980, where he played on the men‚Äôs soccer team and became one of the most decorated players ever at UConn under Joe Morrone. He was named a first team All American in 1981. He was also a second-team All American in 1980 and earned honorable mention in 1978. The New York Cosmos under head coach Hennes Weisweiler of the North American Soccer League (NASL) selected Kapp with the fourth pick in the first round of the 1981 NASL College Draft. He played with the Cosmos and was a teammate of players Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto, Giorgio Chinaglia, Vladislav Bogicevic and Johan Neeskens until the end of the 1983. They were Soccer Bowl finalists in 1981 and won the championship in 1982. Besides competing in the North American Soccer League, the Cosmos traveled all over the world playing against world-class teams in Asia, South America, Central America, Africa and Europe. On November 16, 1983, the Cosmos released Kapp and several other teammates because of salary constraints and downsizing of the club. In December 1983, Kapp signed with the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). After the Spirit folded, he moved to the Los Angeles Lazers in 1986 along with former Cosmos and Olympic teammate David Brcic and remained with the team through 1990. Kapp also was a member of the U.S. Olympic soccer team at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he started all three games under coach Alkis Panagoulias. The 3‚Äì0 win over Costa Rica was attended by 78,265 fans in Palo Alto, California. The U.S. went 1-1-1, beating Costa Rica 3-0,losing 1-0 to Italy, and tying Egypt 1‚Äì1. They failed to make it to the second round despite playing with professional players. Kapp also earned five caps with the U.S. national team between 1983 and 1985. The national team did not play many games during that period. His first cap came in the only U.S. game in 1983, a 2‚Äì0 win over Haiti. Kapp came on for Alan Merrick. He then played three games in 1984, scoring in a 4-0 blowout of the Netherlands Antilles. His last cap came on May 15, 1985, in a victory over Trinidad and Tobago. The U.S. national team did not qualify for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. He owns a soccer retail store in Mamaroneck, New York. He also coaches and runs summer soccer camps in Westchester, New York.

Biography Tony Stradling was born in Solihull, Warwickshire. He received his early education at Solihull School. He took a First in physics from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1955, followed by his DPhil studies in the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford. He was appointed University Lecturer at Oxford and Fellow of Christ Church in 1968. In 1978 he took up the Chair of Natural Philosophy at St Andrews University. He remained in Scotland until 1984, when he moved back to England as Professor of Physics at Imperial College. He held this position until his retirement shortly before his death. His early work was on the cyclotron resonance of semiconductors moving to magnetophonon resonance. He and his team of students used this effect to investigate a wide range of phenomena in the II-VI, III-V and elemental semiconductors. He pioneered the use of infra-red gas lasers combined with high magnetic fields to carry out cyclotron resonance and impurity spectroscopy measurements. Hydrostatic pressure was another tool for investigating band structure and impurity states in semiconductors that he exploited, particularly at St Andrews. He also investigated the spin and giant magnetoresistance properties of the narrow gap III-V compounds. One of the legacies of Stradling‚Äôs research is his measurement of the effective masses and band parameters of many semiconductor materials, which continue to remain useful for semiconductor technologists. For example, his team's measurements of the effective masses of carriers in the III-V compounds are used to design lasers and fast transistors. These devices are used in electronics, optoelectronics and data storage. Tony‚Äôs appointment to a Chair of Physics at Imperial College London rapidly established Imperial as a leading international centre in semiconductor physics. His international renown was enhanced by his editorship of the journal Semiconductor Science and Technology, which he was instrumental in founding. Tony Stradling lived in Oxford and commuted to London daily. He died on 26 November 2002. Honours He was awarded the Institute of Physics C V Boys Prize in 1975.

Rosen (March 20, 1926 ‚Äì January 30, 2017) was an American electrical engineer, known as \\"the father of the geostationary satellite\\", and \\"father of the communications satellite\\".AW&ST;, 24 March 2014, p. 51 He formed and led the team that designed and built the first geosynchronous communications satellite, Syncom, for Hughes Aircraft Company. Career Rosen served in the US Navy as a radio communication and radar technician during World War II. He graduated from Tulane University in 1947 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical engineering.Hagerty, James, Engineer launched commercial satrellite era, Wall Street Journal, February 11‚Äì12, 2017, p.A5 He received his M.S. (1948) and Ph.D. (1951) in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology. While still in graduate school, he began working for Raytheon, where he helped develop early anti-aircraft guided missiles, making many innovations in the fields of radar and missile guidance and control. After joining the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1956, and while he was working on the development of airborne radars, the world was catapulted into the space age by the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite. At the same time, his department's most important program was cancelled. His boss, Frank Carver, challenged him to find a worthwhile new project that could keep the skilled staff gainfully employed. Stimulated by the possibilities of the new Space Age, Rosen wanted it to be some kind of space program. Because at that time international telephony was very expensive and hard to arrange, and transoceanic television was impossible, he decided it should be some kind of communication satellite since these problems could be solved that way. He began to research what kind of communication satellite system would work best for this purpose. At the time, Rosen was unaware of science writer Arthur C. Clarke's 1945 description of a geosynchronous satellite, but he was aware of the conventional wisdom regarding geostationary satellites, expressed most stridently by the highly regarded Bell Labs, at that time the world's leading communications R&D; entity, in a March 1959 IRE Journal titled ‚ÄúTransoceanic Communications Via Satellites,‚Äù written by John Pierce and Rudy Kompfner. They expressed the view that geostationary satellites would be too heavy to be launched by the rockets that were then available. And, even if geostationary satellites could be launched, their presumed complexity would prevent them from having a long enough lifetime to be commercially viable. Rosen, in reading their paper, felt otherwise. He reasoned that since Bell Labs designed communication equipment for ground applications, it had little incentive for keeping the weight down. Also, he was confident that his previous experience in guided missile design was more relevant for designing the control system for such a satellite and that the supposedly-complex control system the authors claimed would be necessary would not be needed. Rosen had an epiphany when it occurred to him that if he used spin-phased impulses on a spin- stabilized satellite, he could have a simple, long-lived control system to go along with the satellite's lightweight electronics. He gathered a small team of gifted colleagues (most notably, Don Williams, Tom Hudspeth and John Mendel) to convert the concept into a design for a practical geostationary communication satellite system. The spin stabilized satellite itself weighed only 55 pounds.Hagerty, James, Engineer launched commercial satrellite era, Wall Street Journal, February 11‚Äì12, 2017, p.A5 When his superiors initially refused to fund the project, Rosen began talking to his contacts at Raytheon; rather than lose him to his previous employer, Hughes' management agreed to support prototype development. He subsequently convinced the U.S. government to fund the Syncom program, a flight program that was based on the Hughes prototype. After a discouraging rocket failure that doomed Syncom I in February 1963, Syncom II was successfully launched in August 1963. It was followed by Syncom III in 1964, in time to relay live television signals from Tokyo during the Summer Olympics. The first commercial satellite, Early Bird, was launched in 1965. With communication satellites a commercial reality, Hughes formed a division to pursue this as a business, and Rosen became its technical director. He later became a vice president of Hughes and a member of its policy board in 1975. In these roles he was key in helping to build the world's largest communications satellite business at Hughes Aircraft Company. Upon his retirement from Hughes in 1992, he joined with his brother Benjamin in another development project. Rosen Motors In 1993 Harold Rosen and his brother Benjamin founded Rosen Motors in Woodland Hills, California. They developed a gas turbine-powered series hybrid automotive powertrain using a 55,000 rpm flywheel energy storage subsystem to provide bursts of acceleration to augment the turbine's more steady power output. The flywheel also stored energy through regenerative braking. The flywheel was composed of a titanium hub with a carbon fiber cylinder and was gimbal mounted to minimize adverse gyroscopic effects on vehicle handling. The prototype vehicle was a Saturn, modified to accept the new engine/flywheel unit. It was successfully road tested in the Mojave Desert in January 1997 but was never mass-produced, when the automakers to whom it was demonstrated chose not to go with the flywheel technology. The company was dissolved in November 1997. Their sister company, Capstone Turbine Corporation (Tarzana, Los Angeles) received the company's technology and continued to develop and market it after 1997. After the closure of Rosen Motors, Rosen became a consultant for Boeing in the design of new satellite systems. Personal Harold Rosen was born on March 20, 1926, in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1944‚Äì1946, he served in the U.S. Navy which provided him with hands-on experience with radio communications and the then- new field of radars. In 1949, Rosen married Rosetta, and they had two sons, Robert (born 1950) and Rocky (born 1966). Rosetta died in 1969. In 1984 he married Deborah Castleman, a satellite systems engineer also working at Hughes Aircraft Company. Rosen died on January 30, 2017, due to complications from a stroke, aged 90.Harold Rosen, satellite communications pioneer, dies at 90 Honors and recognitions Rosen has more than 80 patents.

Social rules systems include institutions such as norms, laws, regulations, taboos, customs, and a variety of related concepts and are important in the social sciences and humanities. Social rule system theory is fundamentally an institutionalist approach to the social sciences, both in its placing primacy on institutions and in its use of sets of rules to define concepts in social theory.  Overview  Social rule system theory notes that most human social activity is organized and regulated by socially produced and reproduced systems of rules. These rules have a tangible existence in societies ‚Äì in language, customs and codes of conduct, norms and laws, and in social institutions such as family, community, market, business enterprises, and government agencies. Thus, this theory posits that the making, interpretation, and implementation of social rules are universal in human society, as are their reformulation and transformation. Human agents (individuals, groups, organizations, communities, and other collectivities) produce, carry, and reform these systems of social rules, and this frequently takes place in ways they neither intend nor expect. This does not mean that social rule systems do not change. They can and do, and that change can be endogenous and exogenous to the society. The implementation of rules ‚Äì and the maintenance of some order ‚Äì always calls for cumulative experience, adjustment, adaptation, etc. In such ways, normative and institutional innovation is generated. There is a continual interplay ‚Äì a dialectic, if you will ‚Äì between the regulated and the unregulated.(Lotman, 1975) What is more, at the same time that social rule systems strongly influence actions and interactions, they are formed and reformed by the actors involved. Human agency is manifest in this dialectical process, played out by participating actors having their specific competencies and endowments, their situational analyses, interpretations, and strategic responses to immediate pushes and pulls to which they are subject.  History  The development of a more systematic conceptualization and theorizing about social rules and systems of social rules emerged in the late 1970s in the collaborative work of Thomas Baumgartner, Tom R. Burns, Philippe DeVille, and later Helena Flam, Reinier de Man, Atle Midttun, Anders Olsson, and others. Its formalization stemmed from a number of articles in the early 1980s.Burns et al. (1985) and Burns and Flam (1987), Machado (1998), Carson (2004), Flam and Carson (2008) Social theory concepts such as norm, value, belief, role, social relationship, and institution as well as game were shown to be definable in a uniform way in terms of rules and rule complexes. Rules and rule configurations may be treated as mathematical objects (the mathematics is based on contemporary developments at the interface of mathematics, logic, and computer science.(Burns and Gomolinska, 2000; Gomolinska, 2002, 2004, 2005) Rules may be imprecise, possibly inconsistent, and open to a greater or lesser extent to modification and transformation by the participants. Rules are key concepts in the new institutionalism,(March and Olsen, 1984; North, 1990; Ostrom, 1990; Powell and DiMaggio, 1991; Scott, 1995, among others) in several variants of socio-cultural evolutionary theory,(Burns and Dietz, 1992; Hodgson 2002; Schmid and Wuketits, 1987) and in work in semiotics,(Lotman, 1975; Posner, 1989) linguistics,(Chomsky, 1957; 1965) and philosophy on ‚Äúlanguage games‚Äù.(Wittgenstein, 1958) Among the many other researchers developing and applying rule concepts in the social sciences.one would also include Cicourel (1974), Giddens (1984), Goffman (1974), Harr√© (1979), Harre and Secord (1972), Lindblom (1977), and Twining and Miers (1982), among many others In general, much of the use of rule concept in the social sciences and humanities has been informal and even metaphorical, with the major exception of Chomsky.Chomsky 1957, 1965  Social rules and the patterning of action  Social rule systems are used to examine all levels of human interaction.(Burns and Flam, 1987; Carson, 2005; Giddens, 1984; Goffman, 1974; Harr√©, 1979; Lotman, 1975; Posner, 1989, among others) They provide more than potential constraints on action possibilities. They also generate opportunities for social actors to behave in ways that would otherwise be impossible, for instance, to coordinate with others, to mobilize and to gain systematic access to strategic resources, to command and allocate substantial human and physical resources, and to solve complex social problems by organizing collective actions. In guiding and regulating interaction, social rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns, and make such patterns understandable and meaningful for those who share in the rule knowledge. Culture and institutional arrangements The Brazilian Carnival parade in Rio de Janeiro is given meanings through shared understanding of culturally defined rules. On the macro-level of culture and institutional arrangements, rule system complexes are examined: language, cultural codes and forms, institutional arrangements, shared paradigms, norms and ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù.. Lotman (1975) and Posner (1989) offer valuable semiotic perspectives with important (not yet analyzed on our part) parallels. On the actor level, one refers to roles, particular norms, strategies, action paradigms, and social grammars (for example, procedures of order, turn taking, and voting in committees and democratic bodies). There are not only role grammars but semantics and pragmatics. There are processes of meaning, interpretation, and adaptation associated with rule application and implementation. Grammars of action are associated with culturally defined roles and institutional domains, indicating particular ways of thinking and acting. In that sense, the grammars are both social and conventional. For instance, in the case of gift giving or reciprocity in defined social relationships, actors display a competence in knowing when a gift should be given or not, how much it should be worth, or, if one should fail to give it or if it lies under the appropriate value, what excuses, defenses and justifications might be acceptable. Someone ignorant of these rules, e.g. a child or someone from a totally different culture would obviously make mistakes (for which they would probably be excused by others). Similarly, in the case of \\"making a promise,\\" rule knowledge indicates under what circumstances a promise may or may not legitimately be broken ‚Äì or at least the sort of breach of a promise that might be considered acceptable. In guiding and regulating interaction, the rules give behavior recognizable, characteristic patterns rules should be adhered to as it should be. magie To varying degrees actors collectively produce and reproduce patterns of appropriate or acceptable possibilities. This can be conceptualized and mathematically developed as an ideal point or collection of \\"approximations\\". Thus, a community of actors sharing a rule complex recognize a wide variety of varying performances of a given rule as a family of resemblances, or \\"the same thing.‚Äù Both in this sense ‚Äì and in the sense that social rules are never learned identically and undergo different rates of adaptation and change over time ‚Äì the concept of rule, and of culture generally, is distributive. ‚Äì making the patterns understandable and meaningful for those sharing in the rule knowledge. Shared rules are the major basis for knowledgeable actors to derive, or to generate, similar situational expectations. They also provide a frame of reference and categories, enabling participants to readily communicate about and to analyze social activities and events. In such ways, uncertainty is reduced, predictability is increased. This is so even in complex situations with multiple actors playing different roles and engaging in a variety of interaction patterns. As Harre and Secord (1972:12) point out, ‚ÄúIt is the self-monitoring following of rules and plans that we believe to be the social scientific analogue of the working of generative causal mechanisms in the processes which produce the non-random patterns studied by natural scientists.‚Äù Cognitive processes Social rule systems play then an important role in cognitive processes, in part by enabling actors to organize and to frame perceptions in a given institutional setting or domain. On the basis of a more or less a common rule system, questions such as the following can be intersubjectively and collectively answered: * what is going on in this situation; * what kind of activity is this; * who is who in the situation, what specific roles are they playing; * what is being done; why is this being done? The participating actors can understand the situation in intersubjective ways. In a certain sense, they can simulate and predict what will happen in the interactions on the basis of the applied rules. Hence, rule systems provide not only a basis for interpretative schemes but also the concrete basis for actors to plan and judge actions and interactions. Social rules are also important in normative and moral communications about social action and interaction. Participants refer to the rules in giving accounts, in justifying or criticizing what is being done (or not done), in arguing for what should or should not be done, and also in their social attribution of who should or should not be blamed for performance failures, or credited with success. Actors also exploit rules when they give accounts in order to try to justify certain actions or failures to act, as part of a strategy to gain legitimacy, or to convince others that particular actions are \\"right and proper\\" in the context. Textually encoded social rules The Magna Carta from 1215 is an early English form of encoded social and legal rules. So called formal rules are found in sacred books, legal codes, handbooks of rules and regulations, or in the design of organizations or technologies that an elite or dominant group seeks to impose in a particular social setting. For instance, a formal organization such as a bureaucracy consists of, among other features, a well- defined hierarchical authority structure, explicit goals and policies, and clear-cut specialization of function or division of labor. Informal rules appear less \\"legislated\\" and more \\"spontaneous\\" than formal rules. They are generated and reproduced in ongoing interactions. The extent to which the formal and informal rule systems diverge or contradict one another varies. Numerous organizational studies have revealed that official, formal rules are not always those that operate in practice. In some cases the informal unwritten rules not only contradict formal rules but take precedence over them under some conditions. Informal rules emerge for a variety of reasons. In part, formal rules fail to completely specify action (that is provide complete directions) or to cover all relevant (or emergent) situations. The situations (in which rules are applied or implemented) are particularistic, even idiosyncratic, whereas formal rules of behavior are more or less general. In some situations (especially emergent or new situations), actors may be uncertain or disagree about which rules apply or about the ways in which to apply them. They engage in situational analyses and rule modification, or even rule innovation out of which emerge informal rules (which may be formalized later). Interpretation and variability However strongly actions are patterned by rules, social life is sufficiently complex that some imagination and interpretation are required in applying rules to a specific action and interaction context. Imagination generates variability in action from actor to actor, and even for a given actor over time. Rules are also interpreted in their application. Even highly formalized, systematic rules such as laws and written rules of bureaucracy are never complete in their specification. They have to be interpreted and applied using situational information and knowledge. Adaptations and improvisations are common, even in the most formally organized institutions. In this sense, rules are generative, and their interpretation and implementation more or less context-dependent. Interpretation varies across a population sharing a rule system, and also across time. In addition, rules will sometimes be learned or implemented with error, providing in some cases an incorrect model for others. Both of these factors result in variability. Moreover, if an action at deviance with cultural rules or standard interpretations is perceived by other actors as advantageous, it may be copied, thus spreading what becomes a new cultural variant. Adherence to and compliance with social rules Actors adhere to and implement rule and rule systems to varying degrees. Compliance with, or refusal to comply with, particular rules are complicated cognitive and normative processes. Typically, there are diverse reasons for rule compliance. Several of the most important factors are: # Interest factors and instrumentalism (stressed by public choice and Marxist perspectives on self- interested behavior). Actors may advocate rules to gain benefits or to avoid losses. # Identity and status. Adherence to rules ‚Äì and commitment to their realization ‚Äì may be connected to an actor's identity, role, or status, and the desire to represent self as identified by or committed to particular rules. It follows that a major motivation in maintaining (or changing rules) ‚Äì e.g. role complexes or distributive rules ‚Äì is to maintain or change their social status. # Authoritative Legitimacy and Sacrality. Many rules are accepted and adhered to because persons or groups with social authority have defined or determined them, possibly by associating them with sacred principles or identifying their causal or symbolic relationship to actors' interests and status. In the contemporary world, we find the widespread institutionalization of abstract meta-rules of compliance that orient people to accepting particular definitions of reality and rule systems propagated by socially defined and often certified authorities, e.g. scientists and other experts. The authority may be scientific, religious, or political (for instance in the latter case, the fact that a democratic agency has determined the rules according to right and proper procedures). Certain rules may even be associated with God, the sacred, and, in general, those beings or things that actors stand in awe of, have great respect for, and may associate with or share in their charisma by adhering to or following their rules. # Normative/Cognitive Order. Actors may follow rules ‚Äì and try to ensure that others follow them ‚Äì because the rules fit into a cognitive frame for organizing their perceptions and making sense of what is going on. People react negatively to deviance ‚Äì even in cases where they are not directly affected (that is, there are no direct apparent self-interests), because the order is disturbed, potentially destabilized, and eroded.Teamsters clash with riot police in the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. Both groups use various methods to assure compliance with institutional rules. # Social sanctions. Laws and formal organizational rules and regulations are typically backed up by specific social sanctions and designated agents assigned the responsibility and authority to enforce the rules. There are a variety of social controls and sanctions in any social group or organization which are intended to induce or motivate actors to adhere to or follow rules, ranging from coercion to more symbolic forms of social approval or disapproval, persuasion, and activation of commitments (in effect, \\"promises\\" that have already been made). In order to gain entrance or to remain in the group, one must comply with key group rules and role definitions. Exclusion from the group, if there are no alternative groups, becomes a powerful sanction. # Inherent sanctions. Many rules, when adhered to in specific action settings, result in gains or payoffs that are inherent in following those rules, such as going with (or against) automobile traffic. In many cases, the reasons for compliance are consequentialist. As many social scientists point out: in automobile traffic, we adhere to or accept as right and proper traffic rules, in particular those relating to stopping, turning, etc. because without them, we recognize that the situation would be chaotic, dangerous, even catastrophic. Most technical rules, for example relating to operating machines or using tools, entail inherent sanctions. Following them is necessary (or considered necessary) for the proper functioning or performance of the technology, or achieving a certain desirable outcome or solution. # veil of ignorance. Actors may not know the consequences of rule compliance and follow rules because they are given, taken for granted, or believed generally to be right and proper. The benefits of adhering to some rule systems can, however, mask hidden costs. # Habits, routines, and scripts. Much rule-following behavior is unreflective and routine. Many social rules are unverbalized, tacit, that is, part of a collective subconscious of strategies, roles, and scripts learned early in life or career, and reinforced in repeated social situations, for instance sex roles, or even many professional roles. Human beings acquire and learn cultural rules and roles ‚Äì in part through being taught, in part through observing and learning the patterns generated by others (that is, both through verbal and non-verbal communication). Of particular importance is the fact that rule systems learned in early socialization are associated with very basic values and meanings ‚Äì even personal and collective identity ‚Äì motivating at a deep emotional level commitment to the rules and a profound personal satisfaction in enacting them. Conformity is then a matter of habitual, unreflected and taken-for-granted ways of doing things. As indicated above, some social rules are enforced, others not: indeed, rules can be distinguished on the basis of the degree to which, and the circumstances under which, they are socially enforced or enforceable. Of course, regardless of the degree of enforceability, they may be complied with because of a desire for order, intrinsic sanctions, or realizing one‚Äôs role and self-identity. Many rules that actors rigorously adhere to are not socially enforceable, but nevertheless actors utilize them in organizing social activities and in shaping social order. Harre and Secord (1972:17) emphasize the freedom of choice in relation to rules and roles: > \\"The mechanistic model is strongly deterministic; the role-rule model is > not. Rules are not laws, they can be ignored or broken, if we admit that > human beings are self-governing agents rather than objects controlled by > external forces, aware of themselves only as helpless spectators of the flow > of physical causality.\\" Social rule system theory and complex institutional arrangements A regular legislative senate is a complex institutional arrangement. On meso- and macro- levels of analysis, social rule system theory is applied to the description and analysis of institutions such as bureaucracy, markets, political systems, and science ‚Äì major orders in modern societies.(Burns and Flam, 1987; Carson, 2004; Flam and Carson, 2008; Machado, 1998) This entails more than a study of social structure, or a contribution to neo-institutionalism. It is a theory that analyses the links between social structure in the form of particular institutional arrangements including role relationships, on the one hand, and social action and social interaction, on the other. The theory shows, for example, in what ways markets and bureaucracies are organized and regulated by social rules at the same time that actors, both inside and outside these institutions, maintain or change the organizing principles and rules through their actions and interactions. The actors involved in a given institution use their institutional knowledge of relationships, roles, norms, and procedures to guide and organize their actions and interactions. But they also use it to understand and interpret what is going on, to plan and simulate scenarios, and to refer to in making commentaries and in giving and asking for accounts. Rule system theory stresses rule-based cognitive processes such as framing, contextualizing, and classifying objects, persons, and actions in a relevant or meaningful way (Carson, 2004). In general, the cultural complex of rule systems contributes to making social life more or less orderly and predictable and solves problems of \\"existential uncertainty\\" within the group, organization, or community bearing and adhering to the rule culture.(Burns and Dietz, 1992; Garfinkel 1981; Luhmann, 1995) As suggested earlier, however, there is always a tension and a dynamic between the regulated and the unregulated, order and disorder (this is also pointed up in empirical studies.such as found in Carson (2004) and Machado (1998) It also considers the production of appropriate or meaningful accounts, discourses, and commentaries in the context of the given institution. In line with the new institutionalism, social rule system theory stresses that particular institutions and their organizational instantiations are deeply embedded in cultural, social, and political environments and that particular structures and practices are often reflections of as well as responses to rules, laws, conventions, paradigms built into the wider environment.(Powell, 2007) Rule system change and evolution Institutional change entails changes in particular rule complexes and/or enforcement activities to the effect that new or deviant patterns of action and interaction are generated and encouraged.(Burns and Flam, 1987; Levi, 1990) Social rule system theorists point to three major power mechanisms of rule system reproduction and change to explain the evolution of social rule systems and institutional arrangements:(Burns and Carson, 2002; Burns and Dietz, 1992; Flam and Carson, 2008; Stinchcombe, 1968) the selective action of the environment; the constraining and facilitating conditions of institutional arrangements with their technologies, available resources, and participants; and creative/destructive human agency. Selective environments operate to bring about the successes of some rule structures and the failure of others and, thereby, shifts in the prevalence of different forms. Rule system changes may be also initiated by social agents. For instance, an elite \\"legislates\\" an institutional change, or a social movement brings about change through coming to direct power or effectively pressuring and negotiating with an established power elite. Changes are also brought about through more dispersed processes, e.g. where one or more agents of a population discover a new technical or performance strategy and others copy the strategy, and, in this way, the rule innovation diffuses through social networks of communication and exchange. The introduction by social agents of new rules and their expression in transformed patterns of action or in innovative physical artifacts ‚Äì such as technologies and socio-technical infrastructures ‚Äì is a major part of institutional change and evolution. In other words, institutionalized changes may be brought about by the \\"selective forces\\" of social as well as physical environments or by the direct action of social agents. This model of change is applicable to economic, political, administrative, socio-technical, and scientific institutional arrangements.(Burns, 2008) References Further reading * Berger, P. L. and T.

It has no foot pedals, no drivetrain, no chain, no gears, no gear shifters, no derailleurs, and no freewheel. Designs Toddler on metal balance bike Balance bikes have been made out of both metal and wood. It can be a normal bicycle with pedals and related parts removed, or it can be purpose-built (especially for very small children, for whom normal bicycles are generally not available). Some are fitted with brakes and come with either air tires or solid foam tires. Most commercially available designs have flat handlebars. To function properly, a balance bicycle must be small enough for the rider to be able to walk the bicycle while sitting comfortably in the saddle, putting both feet flat on the ground. The rider first walks the bicycle while standing over the saddle, then while sitting in the saddle. Eventually, the rider feels comfortable enough to run and \\"scoot\\" while riding the bicycle, then to lift both feet off the ground and cruise while balancing on the two wheels. Learning method Manufacturers of balance bicycles say that children can learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that training wheels slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits, Training wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that training wheels can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear wheel by training wheels that are too low. Adjusting training wheels correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach. USA Cycling President Derek Bouchard-Hall said in a Wall Street Journal article that balance bikes \\"have made training wheels obsolete.\\" History A dandy horse. The first balance bicycle was the dandy horse, and was invented by Karl Drais, the earliest form of a two-wheeler - without pedals. His first reported ride from Mannheim to Rheinau (now a section of Mannheim) took place on June 12, 1817. Drais was a German inventor and invented the Laufmaschine (\\"running machine\\"), also later called the velocipede, draisine (English) or \\"draisienne\\" (French), or nicknamed, dandy horse. This incorporated the two-wheeler principle that is basic to the bicycle and motorcycle and meant the beginning of mechanized personal transport. In 1997, German designer Rolf Mertens developed the first commercially produced Laufrad \\"running bike\\" called LIKEaBIKE. https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/095974-000-A/karambolage-der-gegenstand-die- draisine/  See also  * Jyrobike * Kick bike * Outline of cycling References Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys Category:Road cycles Category:Educational toys de:Draisine (Laufmaschine)#Kinderlaufrad ","title":"Balance bicycle"},{"id":"10150119","text":"Seaton is a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, located in the western suburbs near Findon, Grange and West Lakes.

The capital of the district is Caraz.Official web site of the Huaylas province Its elevation is 2,285 m. In Caraz, the paved road comes from Pativilca. The snow-capped mountains of Tullparahu (6,356 m), Pukarahu (6,259 m), Allpamayu (6,120 m) and others, constitute a splendid frame for the city. Near Parun Lake the snow summits are reflected. There are also mineral-medicinal springs like Colca and Shongor. The settlers produce wool textiles, carpets, ponchos, straw fabrics and the renowned fruit and manjarblanco sweets known as cuarteados. Departing from Caraz to the north, the Santa River is crossed to arrive to the Ca√±√≥n del Pato. The Callej√≥n de Huaylas has become narrow between the highest and vertical walls of rock, without any vegetation and, in this stretch, the rocks of the Cordillera Blanca and Cordillera Negra come closer (less than 5 m of distance). To arrive to Huallanca, at the north end of the Callej√≥n de Huaylas, 33 tunnels must be passed in a trip of 25 km, in which the Santa River breaks, roaring, the Cordillera Negra, to flow to the sea. In Huallanca, 1,410 msnm, the hydroelectric power station of the Ca√±√≥n del Pato is located. In this place, the highway that goes up to Chimbote began. This highway is planned over the ancient embankment of the railroad Chimbote-Huallanca that was destroyed by a cataclysm in 1970. In this place, it also began the highway that leads to the Callej√≥n de Conchucos.

Prodigit Model 2000MU (UK version), shown in use and displaying a reading of 10 Watts being consumed by the appliance The Kill A Watt (a pun on kilowatt) is an electricity usage monitor manufactured by Prodigit Electronics and sold by P3 International. It measures the energy used by devices plugged directly into the meter, as opposed to in-home energy use displays, which display the energy used by an entire household. The LCD shows voltage; current; true, reactive, and apparent power; power factor (for sinusoidal waveform); energy consumed in kWh; and hours connected. Some models display estimated cost. Having a NEMA 5-15 plug and receptacle, and rated for 115 VAC (maximum 125Vac),P4400 specification the Kill A Watt is sold for the North American market. The unit is manufactured by the Taiwanese company Prodigit, which also makes 230 Vac models of similar appearance and functionality for European Schuko, U.K. BS 1363 and Australian AS 3112 receptacles, and a model compatible with 100 VAC for the Japanese market (2022-04,Model 2022-04 Manufacturer's web site. marketed there as the Watt Checker [„ÉØ„ÉÉ„Éà„ÉÅ„Çß„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº] Plus by other companies). The basic models support current up to 15 amperes, power up to 1,875 VA (the 230Vac equivalents also allow up to 15A, corresponding to 3,750 VA). The device can give an indication of the standby power used by appliances. Models There are several models of Kill A Watt meters: P4400 This is the original, most basic version, based on the Prodigit 2000M. From the time it is plugged in, it measures: * Voltage (Volts) * Current (Amperes) * Power (Watts) * Energy Used (Kilowatt-hours) * Frequency (Hertz) * Apparent power (Volt-amperes) * Power factor * Elapsed time The power setting displays instantaneous power, and the kilowatt-hour setting displays energy consumed since last reset. When electricity is disconnected, the P4400's measurements and meters are reset.P4400 Kill A Watt Manufacturer's web site. P4460 Kill A Watt EZ This is an enhanced version, based on the Prodigit 2022, which includes a backup battery to store measurements even when disconnected from electricity. It has the same capabilities as the P4400, and can be programmed with electricity cost information, which enables it to display the cost of the electricity consumed since reset. From this, it can calculate cost per hour, day, week, month, or year. P4320 Kill A Watt PS This model, based on the Prodigit 2024, is integrated into an eight-outlet power strip. Unlike the other models, it does not display frequency or apparent power. It protects against surges and EMI, has a configurable overcurrent shutdown limit, and also measures earth leakage current; one version acts as an earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB).P4320 Kill A Watt PS Manufacturer's web site. It switches power on or off at an AC zero crossing, minimizing current surges and interference.Power Safer ‚Äî New Safety Revolution For Power Strip Fairly thick chinglish, but informative technical description of the features provided. Variations Although identical externally, there have been several different versions of the Kill A Watt and Prodigit equivalents, all essentially of the same design, but with different PCB layout, packaging, and componentsThe Kill-a-Watt: Not all versions are created equal  User modifications  One shortcoming of the Kill-a-Watt range of devices is that they do not have the ability to store, transmit or transfer the readings, thus limiting their usage for any ongoing monitoring purposes. To counter this shortcoming, a couple of openly available modifications have been published on the Web, to enable these devices send data wirelessly to a receiver. A circuit diagram has been drawn up.Kill A Watt P4400/P4460 circuit diagram = Tweet-a-watt = The Tweet-a-watt is a hacked version of the standard Kill-A-Watt Plug in Power Meter. By piggybacking on the device's on- board LM2902N op-amp chip, the creator was able to get readings for voltage and current and transmit to a computer, which then sent this to Twitter via handle @tweetawatt. At the time it gained quite a lot of interest on the Web, but interest waned after some time. The last tweet from this handle was in March 2010. = WattMote = Following the usefulness of the Tweet-a-Watt, designs for the WattMote were released on the Web by another hobbyist, Felix Rusu at LowPowerLab. The modifications use a customized clone of the Arduino chip known as the Moteino, making this version much cheaper, and requires much less soldering than the original design. Further optimizations on the design were done by Mike Tranchemontage, his designs featured a more robust power supply unit to the moteino chip, avoid problems capacitors which discharged too slowly with the original design. =Standby power= Most plug-in wattmeters are not useful for measuring standby power, also called vampire power if the device in standby is not doing anything useful such as being prepared to wake under timer control. Many meters only have a resolution of 1W when reading power; the Kill-a-Watts read down to 0.1W, but this is still too coarse for measuring low standby power. Modification to read standby power has been described and discussed in detail (with oscilloscope waveforms and measurements).Measuring standby power Essentially, the meter's shunt resistor, used to generate a voltage proportional to load current, is replaced by a much larger value, typically 100 times larger, with protective diodes. Readings of the modified meter have to be divided by the resistance factor (e.g. 100), and maximum measurable power is reduced by the same factor.

Southern bushwhacker Silas M. Gordon had been operating out of Platte County, Missouri for a number of months before regional Federal military authorities attempted to capture him and his followers. In November, 1861, two Federal soldiers were killed near the Bee Creek Bridge, a few miles south of Weston, Missouri. By mid- December, elements of the 18th Missouri Infantry had seized neighboring Platte City, and captured three Confederate soldiers: Black Triplett, Gabriel Close, and William Kuykendall. The captives were either on furlough, or had returned home after their enlistment ended. In his history of Platte County, W. M. Paxton, a local resident, related that he spoke to the 18th Missouri's colonel, W. James Morgan, asking on behalf of Triplett's father that he be allowed to speak with his son. Morgan's reply was, \\"Yes, God damn him! Let him say now what he pleases, for he will never see him alive again.\\" Morgan took Triplett and Close near Bee Creek Bridge. Triplett stood and was shot. Close, with his arms bound, fled to the nearby creek bed where he quickly became mired in the mud. A Federal soldier descended upon him and bayoneted him to death. The letters \\"U.S.\\" were scrawled in Triplett's blood on the bridge. The third prisoner, William Kuykendall, was spared.

The facility is a large public indoor shooting range with 32 total lanes. The building's architect was Arrington Watkins of Phoenix, Arizona and the Club is recognized by the National Association of Shooting Ranges as a 'Five Star Facility'.Certificate, National Association of Shooting Ranges The building includes three eight lane public shooting bays, a tactical bay, and a tactical shoot house.  History  The Scottsdale Gun Club opened for business in May 2004. Conceived by Terry Schmidt, Nadine Little and Mark Hanish, the $8.2 million club was to be a full-service facility for military, law enforcement and private citizens alike. Some amount of resistance by the community was met when the club was first proposed. As well, banks were reluctant to finance such a project. However, with the support of shooters and firearms enthusiasts the club was finally approved by the City of Scottsdale in September 2001. Facilities= Indoor shooting range  left There are a total of 32 firing lanes and targets can be set as far as from the shooter. For safety, each lane is separated from the adjacent lanes by bullet-resistant glass. The range's backstop can handle most calibers of rifle and handgun; anything that produces less than 8100 pound/feet of force. Each lane has an advanced system that controls that lane's respective target, increasing safety. This system is also more time efficient because it removes the need to walk down range to check or change targets. The range utilizes 180 air filters to keep the air fresh and clean by moving gasses away from shooters immediately.  Gunsmithing Department  Scottsdale Gun Club has a fully staffed gunsmith department that can repair or modify most makes and models. Turn around time varies depending on the services you would like performed as well the level of volume.  Titanium Lounge  SGC offers different levels of membership, and the highest level (Titanium) offers access to the Titanium Lounge. It has 8 shooting lanes open only to Titanium Members as well as a private attendant and a lounge area that recalls the decor of an exclusive English hunting club complete with pool table, big screen TV, comfortable couches, high back chairs, and a conference table. It is designed to provide a relaxing area for members while they take a break from shooting as well as a comfortable area for their guests.

It has a population of 4,241 inhabitants. Offingen lies in the Donauried between Ulm and Donauw√∂rth on the Danube and Mindel. The Ulm‚ÄìAugsburg railway line crosses the town. Neuoffingen station was an important interchange for decades.  History = Offingen and Landstrost  Offingen is, as can be derived from the name ending -ingen, the foundation of an Alemannic clan. The place name is derived from a clan leader Offo. The village developed as a street village at the intersection of the Roman road from G√ºnzburg to Augsburg with the valley path leading along the Kammeltal. The village was first mentioned in a document dated 4 September 1186, in which Pope Urban III confirmed, among other things, that it was owned by the Augsburg bishop Udalschalk. At that time, the local government was exercised by Augsburg ministers. One of these ministerials was Konrad Schoberlin, whose gift of goods from the year 1209 has given an early mention of the town. At the beginning of the 14th century Offingen became part of the margraviate of Burgau together with the neighbouring castle Landstrost by an area exchange. The town and its citizens were then pledged several times to secure monetary claims against creditors. From 1380 the lords of Westernach appeared in Offingen over such pledged possessions and partly also fief possessions. In 1518 Eustachius von Westernach sold his fief and pledged property to the lords of the Stain zu Rechtenstein at Reisensburg. Around 1550, they found themselves in an economic emergency and sold the Offingen estate to the lords of Schellenberg zu H√ºfingen in 1599. However, they also became indebted with the property and transferred the fiefdoms back to the barons of Freyberg- Eisenberg in Haldenwang in 1659, who held the local sovereignty until the redemption of the feudal rights in the 19th century. Saint George's church, Offingen Offingen around 1840 with church and castle View on Offingen No major incidents occurred in Offingen during the German Peasants' War of 1525. Rather, the Offingen peasants seemed to have held back, since in March 1525 the Leipheimer Haufen moved to Offingen in order to force Offingen peasants into its alliance. After the defeat of the peasant uprising only two Offingen ringleaders were punished; the village got off lightly with a fine. From the Thirty Years' War from 1618 to 1648 little is known about Offingen. A tax register from 1627 still mentions numerous wealthy people in the town. Until 1680 any records about the general development of the village are missing. From 1696 to 1700 a new castle was built in Landstrost by the barons of Freyberg. Around 1748 a castle (today's parsonage) was also built in Offingen. Around 1800 Offingen had the status of an Obervogtamt. Since 1806 the place belongs to Bavaria. The trigger was the Rheinbundakte, an alliance of southern German states with France's Emperor Napol√©on Bonaparte. This agreement determined, among other things, that the noble principalities as well as the knightly possessions, which up to then had been directly linked to the empire, were subordinated to the respective sovereign (mediatisation). The castle in Offingen was inhabited by the barons of Freyberg until 1858 and then sold for lack of further use. After the farmer Johann Haupeltshofer became the new lord of the castle in 1862, the community and the church foundation acquired the property in 1878 and used it as a school and parsonage. The castle in Landstrost was severely damaged in 1871 by several landslides and finally demolished in 1872. After the Second World War, the community took in about 1,000 expellees. In neighbouring Schnuttenbach, today a district of Offingen, around 75 Hungarian-Germans and around 250 displaced persons from the Sudetenland were accommodated in a barracks camp.  Incorporations  The municipality of Schnuttenbach was incorporated into Offingen on 1 May 1978. At the same time, the newly founded administrative community of the towns of Offingen, Gundremmingen and Rettenbach began its work, which is based in the new Offingen town hall.  District Schnuttenbach  The village was first mentioned in a document in 1298. Its special jewel is the chapel of Saint Ursula. It is decorated with frescoes from the 12th century. The attached Church of St. Ursula has artistically remarkable stained glass windows by Munich professor Josef Oberberger. Schnuttenbach was the site of a labour camp during the National Socialist era. The documentary film Verborgen in Schnuttenbach by Thomas Gerhard Majewski is dedicated to this camp.  Politics  Mayor Thomas W√∂rz (SPD) has been in office since the 2008 local elections. He was re-elected in March 2014 with 57.3% of the votes. The Market Community Council has 16 members. Since the local elections in 2014, they have distributed their seats on the following lists: * CSU: 5 seats * SPD: 5 seats * Free voters Offingen: 4 seats * Free voters association Schnuttenbach: 1 seat * Young citizens: 1 seat There are faction communities between the CSU and the Free Voters' Association Schnuttenbach as well as the Free Voters Offingen and the Young Citizens.  Education  * Kindergarten St. Georg Offingen (1 cr√®che group, 4 kindergarten groups) * Kinderhaus St. Ursula Schnuttenbach (1 cr√®che group, 2 kindergarten groups) * Primary school Offingen * Secondary school Offingen * Branch Office Adult Education Centre G√ºnzburg  Sights and Sights  Parsonage (former castle) * The Castle in Offingen was built around 1748 as the manor house of the barons of Freyberg. The building originally housed the Patrimonial Court. After the mediatization of the principalities and the abolition of feudal jurisdiction in 1848, the building changed hands several times before it became the property of the parish and the church foundation in 1879 and served as a school and parsonage. The stork's nest on the building now known as the Parsonage is inhabited by storks, which have been hibernating in the nest for several years. * The Catholic Parish church of Saint George was built between 1615 and 1618 by Hans Christoph von Schellenberg and his wife Dorothea on the site of an older predecessor building on the basis of a foundation. The coat of arms of the founder is preserved in the choir vault. The pulpit in the style of the late Renaissance probably still comes from the original equipment of the church. The main altar in the choir dates from the rococo period, the side altars were put together in their present form during a renovation in 1958.History of the parish church St. Georg * The Leonhard Chapel was built in 1747 at the instigation of the Lords of Freyberg in place of an older chapel dedicated to Leonhard. * The Krieger Memorial Chapel was built in 1954 according to plans by Eduard Haertinger. * The Protestant Church of Reconciliation was built in 1965. A Protestant congregation in Offingen did not form until industrialisation in the second half of the 19th century and only reached a significant size after the arrival of Protestant expellees after the Second World War. * At Landstrost there is the Barbara Chapel, at the Chapel Trail to Landstrost there is also a Trinity Chapel from the 18th century. * Since May 2006, the 25-metre-high observation tower on the edge of the Danube valley slope has offered a panoramic view of the Danube valley and the Swabian Alb.

The bronze memorial to the dairy farmer reminds us that the village enabled more than 100 dairy farmers to make a living. The Augsburg entrepreneurs Johannes and Wilhelm Lembert as well as Franz Baptist Silbermann built the felt factory in 1896. It developed into the economically strongest company in the town. In the 21st century, the BWF Group, which emerged from it, had worldwide business contacts and subsidiaries in several countries. Industrial settlements such as the paper factory, the fertilizer factory or a furniture factory lost importance after a temporary heyday. Since 1950, two markets have been held annually in Offingen. On July 14, 1971, the Bavarian State Government awarded the town the official designation Markt (market). The market Offingen is not to be confused with Marktoffingen, which lies about 50 km further north.  Traffic  The Offingen stop The Offingen Haltepunkt is on the Ulm‚ÄìAugsburg railway line. The official opening of this raiylway line on 1 May 1854 promoted passenger and freight traffic. The express mail wagon connection from Dillingen an der Donau to G√ºnzburg was shortly thereafter routed via Lauingen and Gundremmingen to Offinger Bahnhof. A Bavarian law of 29 April 1869 commissioned the construction of a railway link between G√ºnzburg an der Donau and Donauw√∂rth, now part of the Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen railway. The Neuoffingen railway station was built between G√ºnzburg and Offingen. On 15 August 1876, rail traffic was officially launched on the new route. Passenger trains stopped there until 1988. Neuoffingen is one of the last brick stations in Bavaria to be listed. Offingen is connected to several long-distance cycle routes, including the Danube cycle route (runs from the source to the mouth of the Danube)Donauradweg and, within the European EuroVelo network, the EV 6 long- distance cycle route (runs from the Atlantic to the Black Sea over more than 6000 km along six European rivers).EuroVelo 6: Explore European rivers by bike!

Construction  The arch was built around 1760 by James Bridges, for William Reeve, a prominent local Quaker and business man. It is built from Bath stone, of classical proportions but with Gothic and Moorish detail. A plaque on the arch states that it was moved from its original position, as the entrance to the Black Castle Public House, in 1912 and was fully renovated in 1995.  Carvings  Statue on Arno's Court Triumphal Arch The niches on each side of the arch once contained carvings from the demolished City Gates. The rear elevation is much simpler than the front, and includes a carving of the City's coat of arms. Originally the building was the gateway to Arno's Castle, and was moved to form the entrance to Arno's Court Bath House in 1912. The four statues which decorate the archway are 20th-century copies of 13th- and 14th-century originals. The original statues of King Edward I and King Edward III were set in one of the deep niches on the western side that have tent-like canopies. The original statues were taken from Bristol's Lawfords' Gate that was demolished around the time of construction of the arch. Those on the east- side are 13th-century figures from Bristol's Newgate representing Robert, the builder of Bristol Castle, and Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances, builder of the fortified walls of Bristol. The originals of all four were removed due to their deteriorating condition in 1898 and they are now in the St Nicholas's Church Museum.

The picture was produced by Gregory Peck, the third and last feature film he would produce.. The drama is based on the real life experiences of Robin Lee Graham, a young man who spent five years sailing around the world as a single-handed sailor, starting when he was 16 years old. The story is adapted from Dove (1972), the book Graham co-wrote with Derek L.T. Gill about his seafaring experiences. Plot The film tells of real-life Robin Lee Graham (Joseph Bottoms), a 16-year-old boy who sets sail in a 23-foot sloop in attempt to be the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe solo. He had planned the trip with his sailor father Lyle Graham (John McLiam) for years. On one of his stops after setting sail, he meets and falls in love with the gregarious and attractive Patti Ratteree (Deborah Raffin). After much banter, Patti decides to follow Graham throughout his long journey. She meets him in Fiji, Australia, South Africa, Panama, and the Gal√°pagos Islands. As he travels around the globe, Graham experiences many adventures on the sea and land as he matures from a teenager to a young adult. Graham finds the trip a lonely experience, especially when the wind dies on him on the high seas. At one point he badly wants to quit the voyage but Patti (now his new wife) and his father encourage him to continue. At the end of the film, Graham sails into Los Angeles with crowds welcoming him home.

Pearson * Cecily Polson as Mrs. Castaldi Background=Basis of film Robin Lee Graham (born 1949) set out to sail around the world alone as a teenager in the summer of 1965. National Geographic Magazine carried the story in three issues from 1966 to 1970, and he co-wrote a book detailing his journey called Dove. Graham was just 16 when he set out from Southern California and headed west in his 24-foot Lapworth sailboat. He became married along the way, and after almost five years, sailed back into his home port. After he and his wife Patti - who he had met in Fiji ‚Äì attended Stanford University, they moved to Montana and settled down. He collaborated with a writer on a book of the journey which became a best seller. Development Gregory Peck moved into film producing in the early 70s, following his dissatisfaction with some of his late 60s films such as Marooned and Mackenna's Gold, and the recutting of I Walk the Line. He decided to take time out from acting and work as a producer. His first effort, an adaptation of the play, The Trial of the Catonsville Nine, had not been a success so he spent six months reading material to find his next project. Peck was told about the series of articles on Graham that were in National Geographic and that a book was being written about him. Peck read the book while it was still in galleys. \\"I was attracted really because of the character of the boy\\", said Peck. \\"He was a very odd fella, an eccentric who sailed around the world at 16. Loners make interesting heroes.\\" He also liked that it was \\"a strong adventure story.\\" Peck optioned the screen rights for $10,000 of his own money. He knew Nat Cohen and Bernard Delfont of EMI Films from being on the board of Capitol Records. They gave him $150,000 to purchase the screen rights outright and to write a script. EMI wanted a US partner and Paramount agreed to come on board. Filming began under the title of Here There Be Dragons. However, there was concern this would confuse audiences into thinking it was a martial arts film. Upon a Painted Ocean was considered as a title before selecting The Dove. Director Charles Jarrott said the film will \\"make a positive statement about a youth who set out to do something and succeeded. It's not a Disney story, there is some abrasion to it.\\" \\"You can read one or two things into it, the father-son relationship being what it is in the picture\\", said Peck. \\"The movie will make you wonder why a kid would want to drop out, why he wasn't offered the kind of future he was interested in.\\" Casting Peck says at one time they discussed casting \\"one or two rock stars\\" in the lead roles \\"but they're kind of practiced and slick and a little too sophisticated. We looked for naturalness, sympathetic personalities and original personalities. We looked for kids who weren't hindered by too much self confidence, people that had chemistry.\\" Joseph Bottoms was cast in the lead role. \\"The whole picture depends on the kid\\", said Jarrott. \\"If you're stuck on the other side of the world and he doesn't work out, you can't recast the part.\\" Deborah Raffin was cast has his girlfriend. Shooting The film is a travelogue of sorts and the producers filmed on location throughout the world over a four-month period with a 32-person crew. Filming locations include: Suva, Fiji; Darwin, Northern Territory, Fremantle, Western Australia; Cape Town, South Africa; Louren√ßo Marques, Mozambique; Panama Canal, Panama; Ecuador; and Los Angeles. Instead of sailing a boat around the world, Peck bought nine identical boats and shipped them to nine different locations. \\"It was a terrific gamble\\", said Peck. \\"It was exhilarating. I feel I play a role in every scene, even if I don't direct it or act in it. I helped to shape it. I made the thing happen in the first place. Whatever has happened, over the past two years I've certainly known I've been alive.\\" Reception=Box office The film performed poorly at the box office in the USA but did better in Europe. Critical response Critic Nora Sayre, film critic for The New York Times, thought the film was too wholesome, so much so that Sayre wanted harm to come to the characters. Yet she appreciated Sven Nykvist's cinematography and wrote, \\"The Dove ... is probably far too wholesome for most of the families I know, although there may be a radiant audience lurking just outside the realms of my acquaintance ... Joseph Bottoms, as the young sailor, smiles too much in the first half of the movie; after that, he cries too much. His initial overwhelming sunniness turns the viewer into a sadist: You're glad when his cat gets killed or grateful when a shark appears in the ocean. Deborah Raffin, as his winsome girlfriend, is rarely allowed to stop laughing and wagging her head; the two grin and glow at each other until you yearn for a catastrophe.\\" Others liked the film. Film critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, who reviewed the film much later after the film's release on their website Spirituality and Practice, appreciated the film and its message, and wrote, \\"Producer Gregory Peck was perceptive when he decided to make a film based on the true life on the youngest person to circumnavigate the world alone ... Graham's exploits and his accompanying struggle to sort out his feelings about himself and his loyalties to family and girlfriend are fascinating and provocative.\\" The staff at Variety magazine said, \\"... an odyssey which provides nautical chills and thrills (as well as breathtaking scenics) aplenty ... Pic really takes off when he meets the girl (played with gauche hesitation at first, but then with beauty and considerable charm by Deborah Raffin) ... Their yes-no yes-no-yes affair is nicely handled.\\" Peck gave up producing following the death of his son in 1975 and returned to acting.

Abbot Hall was built in 1759 by Colonel George Wilson, the second son of Daniel Wilson of Dallam Tower, a large house and country estate nearby. It was built on the site of the old Abbot‚Äôs Hall, roughly where the museum is today. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries this was where the Abbot or his representative would stay when visiting from the mother house of St Mary's Abbey, York.Abbot Hall website Abbot Hall Official website The architect is unknown. During the early twentieth century the Grade I listed building was dilapidated and has been restored as an art gallery. Collection Lady Anne Clifford and her family in The Great Picture attributed to Jan van Belcamp It has one of the most important collections of George Romney‚Äôs paintings in Britain and several of his sketchbooks and drawings. Paintings from the eighteenth century include a pair of views of Windermere by Philip James de Loutherbourg. There is also an important group of work by another local artist, Daniel Gardner. It has a significant collection of watercolours, mainly from the second half of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries. Many of the greatest watercolourists of the period are represented, including John Robert Cozens, David Cox, Peter De Wint, John Sell Cotman, John Varley and Edward Lear as well as J. M. W. Turner's watercolours The Passage of Mount St. Gotthard and Windermere (1821). In 2011 a triptych of Lady Anne Clifford, entitled The Great Picture (currently (2011) in the ownership of the Lakeland Arts Trust) went on display. The Victorian art critic and social commentator, John Ruskin, lived in the Lake District and the gallery has one of the most comprehensive collections of his drawings and watercolours. The modern collection concentrates more on painting but has sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Jean Arp, and Elisabeth Frink. There are also works by Ben Nicholson, Kurt Schwitters, Bryan Wynter, Sean Scully, David Hockney, LS Lowry, Graham Sutherland, Victor Pasmore, David Bomberg, Hilde Goldschmidt and many others.

It is owned by the Albury Estate managed by the Surrey Wildlife Trust under an access agreement between the estate and Surrey County Council. Features The site reaches with hill-grazed grass slopes below interspersed with trees. There are areas of chalk grassland and woodlands. Visible are some of the greatest prominences of the Western Greensand Ridge and the site lies on the North Downs Way. There are 129 ancient yews with a girth over 3.5m (over approx 500 years old) with some over 6m girth (probably at least 1000 years old) on the northern wooded slope. Some trees are so old the centre is hollow and the whole tree can be walked through.http://www.ancient- yew.org/userfiles/file/NewlandsCornerMerrowDowns.pdf Newlands Corner was a key location in the crime writer Agatha Christie's disappearance in December 1926. Her car was found in a bush overhanging a chalk pit at Newlands Corner, at the bottom of the south side of the hill. She was found some days later having checked in under an alias at a hotel in Harrogate. As a result, Newlands Corner is the setting of the climax of the final scene of the Doctor Who episode \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\". Drove Road at Newlands Corner is a good site in the region for amateur astronomy as it is a dark sky site close to London and its southern satellite towns. With a downhill slope facing south, the viewer faces many constellations such as Orion and Gemini in winter. Once or twice a year the Guildford Astronomical Society and other local societies hold public events at Newlands Corner with about 25 telescopes and 150 members of the public in attendance . Future Plans In October 2015, Surrey County Council announced the first stage of plans to cut funding of Surrey Wildlife Trust (SWT). The plans have spawned an online petition, drawn criticism from the local residents and parish councils in the area, and a ‚ÄúSave Newlands Corner‚Äù website. In July 2018, parking charges were introduced, although the plans for development of a restaurant, shops, and coach park have been halted.

It was opened on 23 October 1926 in Southfields, Wandsworth. At a cost of ¬£6,223, the construction of the mosque and the purchase of the land on which it stands, was financed by the donations of Ahmadi Muslim women in Qadian, Punjab, British India,Marzia Balzani.'An ethnographer among the Ahmadis: Learning Islam in the suburbs' in Gabriele Marranci (ed.) Studying Islam in Practice. Routledge, 2014, p.111.B. A. Jacobsen et al.'The Ahmadiyya Mission to the Nordic Countries' in J. R. Lewis & I. B. T√∏llefsen (eds.) Handbook of Nordic New Religions. Brill, 2015, p.367. with support from the British Muslim convert Khalid Sheldrake. Between 1984 and 2019 the Fazl Mosque was the residence of the caliphs of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, and therefore its de facto international headquarters. The administrative headquarters now lies at the site of the Mubarak Mosque. History Foundation stone bearing the prayers of Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, the second Caliph The design of the mosque is credited to Thomas Mawson. (subscription required) The plans form part of the Mawson archive held by the Cumbria Archive Service. The foundation stone was laid in 1924 by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, the second Caliph, who was visiting London as the representative of Islam at The Conference of Living Religions that was being held at the Imperial Institute in South Kensington. 200 guests attended the foundation ceremony. Building of the mosque began in September 1925 and was completed 10 months later. It was named the Fazal Mosque by the Caliph (Fazal meaning Grace). The mosque during its opening in 1926 The mosque was due to be formally opened by Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia who, however, was stopped from doing so by the Foreign Secretary of the King of Saudi Arabia only a few hours before the ceremony was to start. The planned inauguration, nevertheless, went ahead and Khan Bahadur Sheikh Adbul Qadir, ex-Minister of Punjab Legislative Council, formally opened the mosque on 4 October 1926. 600 distinguished guests representing numerous countries, as well as local MPs and other dignitaries attended the ceremony and the function was well reported in the press. The mosque accommodates 150 worshippers and is also known as the London Mosque. Its first Imam was Maulana Abdul Rahim Dard and its first muezzin (caller to prayer) was Mr Bilal Nuttall. Since 1926 the London Mosque has had eleven Imams. The current incumbent is Ata'ul Mujeeb Rashid who has served as Imam since 1983. Caliph's residence The Caliph's residence: an apartment above the office block beside the Mosque In 1984 the Government of Pakistan promulgated Ordinance XX which prohibited Ahmadis from any public expression of the Islamic faith, rendering the caliph unable to perform his duties as the leader of the Community. In response Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth caliph, left Pakistan and migrated to London, provisionally moving the Ahmadiyya headquarters from Rabwah, Pakistan to the Fazl Mosque in London. Within the mosque complex, a separate building consisting of a hall, offices, and a small apartment on the top floor for the Imam of the mosque was built beside the mosque earlier in 1967. Upon his migration, this apartment became the home of the caliph and following his death in 2003, the home of Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the fifth and current caliph. It remained the permanent residence of the caliph until 2019 when he relocated to Islamabad, Tilford. Influence Reception in honour of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 1935 In addition to the usual flow of MPs, mayors, councillors, scholars and students, The London Mosque has hosted a number of distinguished visitors from far and wide. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, visited the mosque several times and made his famous speech in its grounds when he decided to return to India to represent the Muslims in the sub-continent. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Faisal Bin Adbul-Aziz also visited the mosque in 1935 as did his predecessor, King Saud. The mosque in about 1945 Sir Chaudhry Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, the first Foreign Minister of Pakistan, a President of the International Court of Justice and President of the United Nations General Assembly, lived at the premises for many years. In July 2011 Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex of the UK also visited the mosque in his capacity as a Patron of ‚ÄòThe London Gardens Society‚Äô and thus took the opportunity to inspect the gardens of the Fazl Mosque, which have won numerous awards over the past few years. The Earl was also able to view a small exhibition about the history of the mosque. In 1955 the second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya movement returned to the mosque when he visited Europe for further medical treatment after he was physically attacked in Rabwah, Pakistan. In London he also held a conference of all missionaries stationed in Europe. The third Caliph also visited the mosque many times. Expansion Front of the mosque As the range and frequency of activities in the mosque progressively increased there was need for more space. This increase saw the construction of the multi-purpose Mahmood Hall, as well as the Nusrat Hall, in the grounds of the mosque. From Sunday school classes and school visits, to question and answer sessions and international meetings, The London Mosque has been and continues to be a hive of activity promoting education and religious awareness. From the premises of the mosque, the fourth Caliph was also able to launch the community's satellite TV channel Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International (MTA) in 1994 through which he could transmit televised messages globally to the community and have his sermons heard throughout the world. With the expansion of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, the capacity of The London Mosque has become insufficient and further premises in Surrey and Morden were acquired for the Baitul Futuh mosque. However, the historic significance and role of The London Mosque continues to ensure its special and indeed unique position for both the global Ahmadiyya Muslim Community as well as Britain.

They see Torngarsuk as their benefactor; when the Anguekkok call upon him, they ask that if he does not come that he leave them \\"in the land of plenty\\". Familiar Each angakkuq keeps a familiar spirit in a leather bottle which he evokes and consults like an oracle. This familiar spirit seeks Torngarsuk in a cave and brings good fortune as well as healing power. Popular culture In popular culture, the term or phrase Tornasuk and angekok are best known from a simple and short reference to this part of Inuit mythology and ideology by H. P. Lovecraft in his famous short-story \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", where these ideas are portrayed as part of an \\"Eskimo diabolist\\" cult who revere Cthulhu as an avatar or tangible form of Torngarsuk.

E. bulbosa is the only species in the genus Erigenia and tribe Erigenieae. This plant is known as harbinger of spring because it is one of the earliest blooming native wildflowers of rich forests in the mid-latitude United States. Throughout most of its range it blooms from late February through early April. Description It is a small spring ephemeral reaching only 5‚Äì15 cm tall when in flower, and slightly larger afterwards. Each spherical bulb gives rise to a single purplish stem, which terminates in an umbel. The flowers have white petals and large dark- reddish anthers. The teardrop shaped petals are 3-4 millimeters long, widely spaced and do not touch each other. As is characteristic of the carrot family, the leaves of this plant are sheathed at the base and pinnately divided into many small sections. Distribution and habitat Harbinger of spring is an occasional plant in rich hardwood forests of eastern North America. It is found as far north as central New York and southern Wisconsin, west to the western Ozarks, and south to central Alabama.USDA PLANTS Database: Erigenia bulbosa It is also found in extreme southern Ontario. Ecology Its typical associates include spring beauty (Claytonia virginica) and cut-leaf tooth wort (Cardamine laciniata). All of these early spring blooming plants are pollinated by solitary bees, and to a lesser extent, flies and honey bees. E. bulbosa has a small daily accumulation of nectar per flower (7‚Äì38 ¬µg sugar/flower), but the presence of numerous, closely arranged, simultaneously blooming flowers in the umbel may increase the overall nectar incentive for the pollinators. The nectar produced by E. bulbosa only contains the sugar fructose.Dailey, et al. 2003. Nectar rewards of co-flowering spring herbs in woodlands and adjacent agricultural fields. Abstracts: 87th Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of America. Erigenia bulbosa does not form vesicular- arbuscular mycorrhizal associations with fungi, in contrast to most plants. These plants are protected in New York and Wisconsin as state endangered plants, and in Pennsylvania as threatened. Uses The bulb is edible both cooked and raw.Plants for a Future Database: E. bulbosa. The Cherokee were known to chew this plant as medicine for toothaches; it is unknown what parts of plant they chewed.Dr. Moermann's Ethnobotanical database: E. bulbosa This plant is sometimes used in native wildflower gardens throughout its range.

He served in this role from the beginning of the Rebbe's leadership in 1950 until his death in 1994. Today he continues to serve as the senior Mashpia in the central Lubavitcher yeshiva at 770 Eastern Parkway. His position as leading Choizer and Meiniach makes him the default authority on the Rebbe's teachings specifically, and he is universally recognized as the greatest scholar of general Chabad Chassidic doctrine and thought. He is referred to familiarly amongst Chabad Chasidim as Reb Yoel. He is the son of Refoel Nachman (Folle) Kahn, author of Shemu'os VeSippurim. He has no children. Biography=Early life He was born in the Soviet Union, on 16 Shevat, 5690 which corresponds to February 14, 1930. His father Refoel Nachman Kahan, studied in the original Yeshiva Tomchei Temimim, in the town of Lubavitch, White Russia and authored Shemu'os VeSippurim an authoritative and multi-volume compilation of historical accounts and anecdotes, culled from the traditions handed down by reliable Chassidim of earlier generations and his own experiences. At a young age he emigrated to the Land of Israel together with his family, and studied in Yeshiva \\"Achai Temimim\\" in Tel Aviv under the tutelage of the famous Mashpia Rabbi Chaim Shaul Brook. During his teen years he also studied privately with the famed Mashpia and teacher of Chassidic thought Rabbi Moshe Gourarie. He also knew and was influenced by Rabbi Nochum Goldshmidt and to a lesser degree, by Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Kesselman. Arrival in New York In 1950 Kahan traveled to New York in order to continue his studies at the central Yeshiva Tomchei Temimim at 770 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. At the time 770 was also the home and synagogue of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth Rebbe of Chabad, and Kahn expected to be able to meet R' Schneersohn, whose teachings he had studied all his life. However, when he finally arrived in New York by sea it was too late, the man who was to become known as \\"the Previous Rebbe\\" had already died. Kahn remained in New York and soon became very attracted to Schneersohn's younger son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who eventually became the seventh Rebbe of Chabad. For decades Kahan served as Schneerson's main choizer, repeater.The empty chair, Neta Sela, Yediot Aharonot, February 7, 2007.

The Asterisk (; Slavonic: –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∏—Ü–∞, Zvezd√≠tsa), or Star-cover (from the Greek Œ±œÉœÑŒÆœÅ, ast√™r, meaning star), is one of the holy vessels used in the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches. The asterisk symbolizes the Star of Bethlehem. Historically, it was also used in some parts of the Roman Catholic Church. Form An asterisk is a small, folding metal covering which keeps the veil and A√´r (larger veil) from disturbing the particles of bread on the diskos (paten). The asterisk is made of two strips of metal laid one on top of the other and joined in the center by a brad or screw. When the two pieces are turned perpendicular to each other it forms a cross. The ends of the metal pieces are bent down so that it makes a standing frame. Sometimes, in Greek Catholic usage, a small star will be suspended from the asterisk where the two strips of metal are joined. Among Orthodox, however, the asterisk itself is considered to be the star, so no addition to it is deemed necessary. As the asterisk is one of the sacred vessels, it is usually kept on the Prothesis (Table of Oblation), where the bread and wine are prepared for the Eucharist, and no one except the priest or deacon should touch it. Often when a chalice and diskos are made, an Asterisk, and a liturgical spoon, and spear will be made to match them. Use During the Liturgy of Preparation, after the priest has prepared the bread and the wine, he will cense the asterisk by holding it over the open censer. He then places it on the diskos as he says the words, And a star came and stood over the place where the young child was (Cf. ). During a Hierarchical Liturgy (i.e., one at which a bishop presides), just before the Great Entrance, the veils and asterisk will be removed and the bishop will make commemorations for the living and the dead, after which he will replace the asterisk and veils. After the Sursum Corda, the deacon will lift the asterisk up from the diskos, and strike the diskos with it on four sides, making the sign of the cross, while the priest raises his hands and says, \\"Singing the triumphant song, shouting, crying aloud, and saying:\\" at which the choir begins the Sanctus. The deacon kisses the asterisk, folds it, and lays it aside on the Antimension, as the priest begins the Prayer of the Anaphora. After the Communion of the Faithful, the veils, spear, spoon, and asterisk are placed on the diskos. The priest hands them to the deacon, who carries them back to the Prothesis. Coptic Use In the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Churches, the asterisk \\"consists of two silver arched bands, held by a screw, crossed over each other into the shape of a cross, usually surmounted by a small cross\\". In Arabic it is referred to as the Dome and is believed to represent both Christ's tomb and the cave in which he was born. Either the asterisk itself or the cross above it also symbolises the Star of Bethlehem. For this reason, the whole item is sometimes simply called the Star. Roman Rite Use In the Roman Rite, a special twelve-ray asterisk was used in Papal Masses, as a covering for the host on the paten, when it was brought to the Pope at his throne for his Communion. Unlike the Eastern asterisk, which has four rays, the Papal asterisk had twelve rays, each inscribed with the name of an Apostle. Its use has been recently revived by Pope Benedict XVI.Image of Papal asterisk ReferencesExternal links *Liturgy of Preparation The Asterisk is in the foreground, resting on a red A√´r *Deacon striking the Diskos with the Asterisk Category:Catholic liturgy Category:Eucharistic objects Category:Eastern Christian liturgical objects Category:Coptic Orthodox Church ","title":"Asterisk (liturgy)"},{"id":"10150747","text":"Ziemetshausen is a municipality in the district of G√ºnzburg in Bavaria in Germany.

Development  The Morelli M-100 was a single-seat sailplane designed in response to a 1956 competition sponsored by the Aero Club d'Italia for a low-cost training glider. The winning design, by Prof. Ing. Piero Morelli, was put into production the following year. As originally designed, the M-100 was of conventional, high-wing sailplane configuration, with a stubby T-tail. In 1958, the FAI published the new Standard Class rules for sailplanes, and since the M-100 was close to this specification, the design was modified to comply. This involved numerous changes to the wing, including lengthening and thickening the structure, and adding larger and more numerous rotating airbrake segments. The tail unit was revised too, and given a conventional fin. This version was designated the M-100S. The M-100 and M-100S were manufactured by Aeromere, CVT, Avionautica Rio in Italy, and S.A. CARMAM, in France as the CARMAM M-100S M√©sange (tomtit). Eighty three aircraft were built in Italy and a further 140 at CARMAM in France.

Howard on bass guitar and Ian Werden on drums. Early years The band began in Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC in the late 1980s. McCain and Howard had been friends since early childhood and played together in the Mt. Vernon Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, which Howard led. Later, while attending West Potomac High School, Howard befriended Werden who had recently moved to Alexandria from Detroit. The two played together in several short-lived bands, notably The Clockmen and Frankly Scarlett, with the guitarist Alex Lane. In 1989, Howard and Werden joined St. Stephens students McCain and Luke Taylor to form The Moorish Idylls. The band frequently played the \\"Open Mike Coffeehouse\\", a monthly gathering at the Mt. Vernon Unitarian Church, which featured local acoustic bands and soloists. The Moorish Idylls were the first band to play \\"electric\\" at the Coffeehouse. After the four band members had graduated from high school and attended separate universities, The Moorish Idylls played only a few shows. One notable gig was the first Cecilfest on July 10, 1993, where several new songs were debuted, indicating a new musical direction for the band. In autumn 1994, Howard's stepfather Harvard told him about his good friend from his 1950s army days whose nickname was Slackdaddy. Slackdaddy was known to be quite flirtatious and popular with women, yet as a married man, he never committed adultery. During an argument with his wife, who was convinced that he had cheated, she shot him dead. Howard was so moved by this \\"patron saint of misunderstood men\\" that he decided to rename the band Slackdaddy. It was also around this time that rhythm guitarist Luke Taylor left the band, leaving Slackdaddy as a power-trio. During summer 1995, the band played several shows in the Washington area, including several at Jenkin's Hill, a basement bar near the U.S. Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue. On December 31, 1995, Slackdaddy played the Laughing Lizard in Old Town Alexandria.  Career  In 1996, the band decided to move to Athens, Georgia, noted for its lively underground scene. Playing many well-known clubs in the area, the group gained enough popularity to tour. They also hosted the 1997 Shanti Festival at their house in Comer, GA.http://www.redandblack.com/variety/slackdaddy-should-not-be-mistaken-for- jam-band/article_4ac91cc6-e0b9-51b4-961f-ba9e34ddf696.html For two years, 1996‚Äì2001, they toured the southeast.http://www.redandblack.com/variety/celebrate-st-paddy-s-with- slackdaddy/article_8791da08-7afb-5c62-94ee-3f58a232e7a4.html Their debut first album, Is, was released in February 1998, on Roundtable Records. This success eventually lead to a 1999 nationwide tour.

Slackdaddy then released its last album in 2004, Karmageddon, which is available as a free download on the Slackdaddy website.  Current status  The band has not recorded since 2003, when McCain left to finish his master's degree. This eventually led to his marriage and a child. The future of the band is unknown at this time. The band has played just a few shows since 2003. On March 12, 2004, the band played Caledonia Lounge in Athens which was recorded on video and can be viewed on the Slackdaddy website.

Uses Canoe with sails made from lauhala. The hala tree is of great cultural, health and economic importance in many Pacific Islands. The fruit of the tree is used as a food source in many Pacific Islands. The fruits are often consumed fresh or as a preserved food while the trunks of P. tectorius can be used as building material, and leaves for thatching. Though many parts of the hala tree are utilized, in Hawaii the most common use of Hala is the leaves. Hawaiians distinguish five kinds of the hala tree according to the colour and size of the fruits:. * hala ula (orange red) * hala lihilihi ula (red tip, becoming yellow to the centre) * hala ƒ´koi (bright orange only at the tip) * hala melemele (yellow) * hala pia (not quite white, small fruit) Weaving Hawaiian woman weaving lauhala mat with rolls of prepared leaves called k≈´kaa German stars made from lauhala in Puna, Hawai ªi Many Pacific cultures weave, plait, or braid the leaves of the P. tectorius to create useful items such as baskets, mats and hats. Though it is a long and arduous process to prepare the leaves for weaving, the final products are works of art with a pleasing earthy feel. Remains of lauhala from burial caves in Hawaii show almost the same patterns as more recent woven objects, therefore the tradition of this craft seems to be very old. The district of Puna on the Island of Hawai ªi was known for the abundance of hala. \\"Puna paia  ªala i ka hala: In Puna the walls are fragrant with hala\\". During the Hawaiian Renaissance the lauhala weaving became popular again, and nowadays also non traditional items. Types of Lauhala Hƒ´nano: the rare male flower of hala (Pandanus tectorius)'' The favored lauhala for weaving was called \\"lauhala kilipaki\\". The leaves of this Pandanus sp. were exceptionally soft and durable. They were highly prized for their beauty in color and the ease with which they could be plaited. Special sleeping mats were created out of the \\"Hƒ´nano\\", male flower, of the hala tree. The light colored bracts were very soft and pliable and made very finely woven mats reserved for the chiefs (moena hƒ´nano' or  ªahu hƒ´nano). They were especially prized because of their scarcity. Male plants are much less common in the wild than female, and they only make a few flowers per season. The bracts are also very short, about long and wide, with only about two thirds of the bract actually usable for weaving.

His 291 carries broke the school record for a season and his 138.5 all-purpose yards-per-game ranked 16th best in the nation. He earned All-SEC and second-team All-American honors in 1994. In the Florida Citrus Bowl, he became the first Bama player to gain over 100 yards rushing and receiving in a postseason game, after posting 166 rushing yards on 27 carries and 8 receptions for 155 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown reception for the winning touchdown with 42 seconds remaining, in the 24-17 victory over Ohio State University. Williams finished his college career with 2,486 rushing yards (fifth in school history), 535 carries (third in school history), 27 rushing touchdowns (fourth in school history) and 424 receiving yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. He is also remembered for his signature touchdown dance, the \\"Sherman Shake\\". Professional career Entering the 1995 NFL draft, the Dallas Cowboys considered their roster so strong, that they drafted players based on their contributions as backups. The team traded their first round draft choice (#28-Derrick Brooks) to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two second-round picks (#41-Ron Davis and #63-Shane Hannah). The Cowboys selected Williams with their first choice in the second round (46th overall), which was criticized by the media and quarterback Troy Aikman, for using a high selection on a backup player. As a rookie, he was a part of the Super Bowl XXX championship team. He tallied 205 rushing yards (second on the team) and one touchdown. In 1996, he had 269 rushing yards. In 1997, he was expected to relieve more of Emmitt Smith's workload, but the additional playing time exposed him as fumble-prone, even though he had a career-high 468 rushing yards. Williams was released during the 1998 offseason, after the team signed Chris Warren to be the backup running back to improve their depth. When Warren strained his groin in preseason, the team re- signed Williams as insurance. He contributed by being third on the team on special teams tackles (17) and while Warren's injury forced him to miss eight regular season games, Williams stepped up against the New York Giants in Week 3, when he rushed for 61 yards on 20 carries (including an 18-yard touchdown run) and in the final game of the regular season against the Washington Redskins, when he rushed for 90 yards on 23 carries and also caught three passes for 19 yards. In the spring of 1999, Williams played for the Mobile Admirals of the short-lived Regional Football League. The Admirals were league champions, and Williams was named league MVP. In the 1999 NFL preseason, after the Cowboys third team running back (Tarik Smith) suffered a season-ending knee surgery, Williams was once more re-signed, but was eventually released after the first game of the regular season. Personal life In 2000, Williams was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison, for three counts of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and a separate plea for passing counterfeit currency. Saying that his time as a professional football player toughened him, Williams said in a prison interview, \\"You know, I would think that things that would kill the average man wouldn't even make me flinch\\". He was incarcerated on April 20, 2000. He was released on March 1, 2014. After his release from prison, Williams started a community assistance program for disadvantaged children and returned to the University of Alabama, receiving his degree in May 2018.

Salvatore continued to gain political influence from Tammany Hall and, after announcing he and the Young Chuck Connors Association intended to hold a grand ball in opposition of Chuck Connors' annual gala, he eventually succeeded in forcing Connors to compromise in which his name would appear on the programme of the Young Chuck Connors Association as a patron in between then World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Jim Jefferies and retired heavyweight champion Jim Corbett.

Ray Dunn was one of the towering figures at Richmond who laid the foundations for the club's greatest era of success. An immensely successful defence lawyer who won many significant cases, Dunn devoted much of his spare time and energy to the Tigers over a period of almost forty years. The son of a cop Born at Geelong, Victoria, he was the second son of Victorian-born parents, police constable Thomas Dunn (1884‚Äì1953) and his wife Mary Ellen (n√©e Hudson). Tom Dunn had a distinguished police career after joining the force in 1906. Intelligent and efficient, he was transferred to Russell Street headquarters in 1924, and for the decade from 1927, he successively worked as a special adviser and assistant to (Sir) Thomas Blamey and to Alexander Duncan. Awarded the Royal Victorian medal in 1934, Tom Dunn retired as the state's second- ranking policeman in June 1944 after 34 years' service. His son Ray was sent to schools in Geelong and Essendon, and attended the University of Melbourne on a scholarship. He received an LL.B. in 1930, an LL.M. two years later and in his final year was awarded the Supreme Court judges' prize. Dunn married Marie Ellen Whelan at St Teresa's Catholic Church, Essendon, in June 1934. Together, the couple had two daughters. They later divorced and Dunn remarried in Sydney during 1951. With his second wife, Kathleen Monica Patricia (n√©e Foster-Wightman), Dunn had a son, Michael, but this marriage also ended in divorce. The Great Defender Dunn was a distinctive figure around the magistrates' courts of Melbourne - he was balding, plump, wore glasses and had a memorable, gravelly voice. He chose to remain a solicitor and declined all inducements to become a barrister. Despite this decision, Dunn built a reputation as one of the outstanding defence lawyers of his time. A man of stunning mental agility, he defended clients against police prosecutions of any type and specialised in gaming legislation. In 1967, he forced the Victorian government to amend the Motor Car Act of 1958, when he secured an acquittal for a truck driver accused of exceeding the blood alcohol limit. Throughout his life, Dunn was closely associated with the police force, both in and out of the courtroom. He lectured on prosecution and criminal law in courses at the Detective Training School and the Victoria Police College, and acted as legal counsel for the police many times. Engaged by the Victoria Police Association to defend members who had been counter-summonsed by people that they had arrested, Dunn only lost twice in more than eighty such cases during the mid-1960s. For more than a decade, he worked part-time as a lecturer in criminal procedure at Melbourne University as well as the new law school at Monash University and at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology's articled clerks' course. He was highly sought-after as an after- dinner speaker. Long association with Richmond However, it was Dunn's long service to the Richmond Football Club that brought him the most fame. He first became involved with the club in the 1930s through railwayman and Tiger player Martin Bolger. A vice-president from 1940, Dunn formed Richmond's first coterie group in 1963. The following year, he was elected president with the specific brief to negotiate the move of the club's home games to the Melbourne Cricket Ground for 1965. From there, Dunn oversaw an era of great success, underwritten by the extra finances gained from the move and the efforts of the coterie. Under his administration, the Tigers broke a 24-year premiership drought in 1967 and followed up with another triumph two years later. Unfortunately, Dunn's health then began to fail. He had battled diabetes since the early 1960s, and finally succumbed to a coronary occlusion on 26 August 1971 at his Metung holiday home. Survived by the three children of his two marriages, Dunn was buried in St Kilda Cemetery and his estate was sworn for probate at $239,264. Dunn was granted life membership at Richmond in 1946, and elected to the club's hall of fame in 2002.

Production By 2003, three series, or seasons, of Coupling had been broadcast on BBC Two, all written by the show's creator, Steven Moffat. The show was loosely based on the beginnings of Moffat's real-life relationship with Sue Vertue. NBC commissioned a remake of the show for the American market, reportedly as a replacement for Friends, which was nearing the end of its run. Moffat and original producers from Hartswood Films, Sue and Beryl Vertue, served as executive producers on the NBC adaptation, alongside Phoef Sutton and Ben Silverman. Unlike most adaptations, the NBC adaptation would reuse Moffat's original scripts, although these were adapted by Sutton and were shortened to comply with the reduced running time (NBC has multiple advertisement breaks compared to the original broadcaster, BBC Two, which has none). Other writers, such as Danny Zuker and Paul Corrigan worked on episodes later in the series. The original unaired pilot starred Breckin Meyer as Jeff, Melissa George as Susan and Emily Rutherfurd as Sally. NBC then fired the writers and replaced Meyer, George and Rutherford with Christopher Moynihan, Rena Sofer and Sonya Walger, respectively. George later commented that she \\"dodged a bullet\\" by being replaced before the show aired. Thirteen episodes were commissioned. However, due to poor critical reception, NBC announced the show's cancellation on October 31, after only four episodes had been broadcast. The final three planned episodes were not filmed, with the remaining six episodes unbroadcast. Reception The show received a dismal reaction from viewers and failed to perform in the ratings, being canceled before the November sweeps, with six episodes remaining unaired despite heavy publicity by the network. It was immediately panned as a poor imitation of the original UK series by viewers and critics. BBC America even ran commercials noting that they would play the original British versions on their station just after the American equivalent episodes on NBC aired, so that viewers could see instantly just how superior the original was. Miscasting and stilted delivery of a nearly identical script were believed to be the reasons for the failure, though creator Moffat blamed the show's failure on NBC's intervention during the creative and production processes. In 2007, he said: \\"The network f --ked it up because they intervened endlessly.\\" The American adaptation came at a time when NBC was having success with remakes of BBC shows, such as The Weakest Link and Dog Eat Dog. NBC would find success in 2005 with a remake of another BBC series, The Office, which aired for nine seasons. Because of what was deemed to be indecent content, two affiliates of NBC refused to air the program; KSL-TV (Channel 5) in Salt Lake City, and WNDU-TV (Channel 16) in South Bend, Indiana. Both stations were owned by religious organizations, as KSL is owned by the Bonneville International division of the LDS Church, while WNDU was at the time owned by a subsidiary of The University of Notre Dame. In those markets, WB affiliate KUWB (channel 30) and a UPN digital subchannel of CBS affiliate WSBT-TV (channel 22.2, now affiliated with Fox), respectively, aired the series after their network's primetime lineups, while nearby affiliates KENV (in Elko, Nevada, now an affiliate of Comet) and WISE-TV (in Fort Wayne, Indiana, now a CW affiliate) aired the series in accordance with the rest of the network. Jeff Zucker, former President and CEO of NBCUniversal, later said of Coupling that it \\"just sucked\\".

The Youth Fair follows the terms of its lease with Miami-Dade County, which includes a provision for early termination. If the county identifies a relocation site that meets the terms of the lease equal to or better than the present site, and if FIU raises more than the $230 million that relocation will cost (plus the cost of land) there would be a three-year notice to move. However any possible move is, at the very least, years away.

He is best known for commanding the Franco-Roman-German at the Battle of Rossbach, losing to the Prussian Army. Early life He was the third but second surviving son of Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Princess Sophie of Waldeck-Pyrmont, daughter of German Field Marshal Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck. His mother died ten days after his birth, on 15 October 1702. He received the typical education of a nobleman of his time, with some educational journeys to the different countries of Europe. When he was sixteen years old, the prince joined the Habsburg Army and became already in 1719 a Staff Captain in the Infantry Regiment N¬∞18 \\"Seckendorff\\", and fought in it in Sicily during the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1717‚Äì1720). After his conversion to Catholicism in 1728, began for Joseph a fast ascent in his military career. In 1729 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel (Oberstleutnant) and the next year (18 July 1730) colonel (Oberst) of the Regiment \\"Palffy\\". In January 1732 he even got his own 8th Infantry Regiment. Briefly after the outbreak of War of the Polish Succession (1733-1735/1738; since 1734 Generalfeldwachtmeister) he served in the following campaigns in northern Italy. He distinguished himself, especially in the Battle of San Pietro, where he was wounded in the face, and was promoted to Lieutenant field marshal (Feldmarschall-Leutnant) before the end of the war (on 30 April 1735). Joseph ended the War of the Polish Succession with the rank of Feldzeugmeister (25 September 1736). Only one year later, during the Austro-Turkish War, 1737-1739, he was entrusted with the command of an Austrian Corps. In 1737, his attempt to conquer Banja Luka failed, but in practically all important engagements of the war, Joseph displayed personal bravery, for example in the Battle of Grocka (on 22 July 1739), where he covered the retreat of the Imperial Army. War of the Austrian Succession After the war, Joseph was promoted on 11 June 1739 to Generalfeldzeugmeister of the Imperial Army and was appointed Governor of Kom√°rom in Hungary. At the beginning of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) Joseph raised in Kom√°rom new Hungarian Regiments and consulted by the Austrian military administration in the conduct of the war. In 1743 he was appointed High Military Director and General Commander of Inner-Austria, Karlstadt and Warasdin. Thus he was responsible for the organization of the Military Frontier and the military supply. for this service, he was promoted to Feldmarschall (18 April 1744). In May 1749 he was relieved of his duties at his own demand. Battle of Rossbach In the following years, he lived quietly in the Archduchy of Austria. After the outbreak of the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), in the spring of 1757, Joseph was appointed Commander of the Imperial Army, with orders to advance against King Frederick II of Prussia. Together with a French Corps, the Imperial Army was defeated in the Battle of Rossbach (5 November 1757). Joseph, shamed by the defeat, decided to renounce all military functions. In the evaluation by later historians the prince was nearly always blamed for the defeat, although he could hardly have changed the outcome of the fight, because of the catastrophic condition of the Imperial Army and the ineffectiveness of the French troops. Rather symbolic was the appointment to the post of Field Marshal of the Imperial Army (9 November 1785), with which the military career of Joseph ended. He died shortly after. Personal life Joseph maintained for most of his life very good relations with the Habsburg family. In 1739 the Emperor Charles VI appointed him Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, the dynastic order of the Habsburgs. On 13 March 1741 he represented King August III of Poland as godfather of the young Archduke Joseph, the son of the Empress Maria Theresa. This illustrates how close he stood to the new Empress, whose close friend he was to remain the rest of his life. On 17 April 1738 Joseph married in Paris to Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy, niece and sole heiress of the enormous fortune of the deceased Prince Eugene of Savoy. She was also twenty years older than he was. Thanks to this union, Joseph came into the possession of large estates and assets. The marriage, however, was unhappy, and in 1752 they separated, but never formalised the divorce. The prince earned himself a reputation as a patron, but also as a spendthrift. He spent most time at his castle in Vienna, but when his relatives the Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen were heavily indebted, he became by order of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1769 manager of the Duchy, in order to avoid the bankruptcy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. His grandnephew, Duke Ernst Frederick III, was incapacitated to rule. When he died (1780) he left a young heir, the seventeen years old prince Frederick, over whom Joseph took on the role of prince-regent, which he retained until his own death, aged eighty-four.
