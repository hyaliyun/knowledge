The game was first described in 1904 by a German soldier, Moritz Merker, who was serving in the Kaiserlichen Schutztruppe in German East Africa. Merker later became the first ethnologist to study the Maasai culture. En Geh√© is traditionally played by men and warriors, and it usually played in teams of six‚Äìeight people. According to the Maasai oral history, it was devised by Sindillo, son of the first man Maitoumbe. Rules The board used to play En Geh√© is one of the biggest mancala boards; it comprises two rows of up to 40-50 pits each. Rows are called el m√°tuan (sing. ol m√°tua); pits are called 'n gurt√≥t (sing. en gurt√≥to). Each team of players own one of the rows. At game setup, there are 4 seeds in each pit, for a total amount of 320-400 seeds needed to play the game. Seeds are called es soido (sing. os soid). Caesalpinia bonduc seeds, or small stones, are traditionally used. Teams take turns. At one team's turn, one of the team members takes all of the seeds from one of the team's pits and relay-sows them counterclockwise. If the last seed falls in empty pit of the team's row, any seeds in the opposite pit are captured and removed from the game, together with the seed that captured them. The game ends when one the teams has no seeds in its row. The opponent team captures all the seeds, and the winning team is the one that captured most seeds. References * Merker, M.

In particular, Culler and Shalen used the Bass‚ÄìSerre theory, applied to the function field of the SL(2,C)-Character variety of a 3-manifold, to obtain information about incompressible surfaces in the manifold. Based on this work, Shalen, Cameron Gordon, John Luecke, and Culler proved the cyclic surgery theorem. Another important contribution by Culler came in a 1986 paper with Karen Vogtmann called \\"Moduli of graphs and automorphisms of free groups\\".

The protest was held due to Selangor state government's intention to relocate a Hindu temple from Section 19 residential area of Shah Alam to Section 23. The protesters were mainly Muslim who opposed the relocation because Section 23 was a Muslim majority area.

In a press conference later, Hishammuddin defended the actions of the protesters saying that they cannot be blamed. He cited several reasons:Holy cow!

Embarrassingly for Hishammuddin, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), the government multimedia agency, sent a letter to Malaysiakini.com appealing for it to take down both videos of the cow head protests and the press conference by the minister.

He graduated with a degree in Economics from University of Genoa in 1927. and would later receive an honorary degree in engineering from the University of Pisa, in 1951. Piaggio and his brother Armando inherited the family engineering business on their father's death in 1938. This had initially manufactured rolling-stock but had moved into aircraft production by the outbreak of World War II. Their factory was seriously damaged by Allied bombing and was unable to continue aircraft production when the war ended. Enrico Piaggio took the decision to diversify into manufacturing Vespa scooters. This proved to be a far-sighted move, as Piaggio would eventually become one of the biggest manufacturers of two-wheel vehicles in the world. Piaggio had also been critically wounded in September 1943, following a shooting incident in the lobby of the Excelsior Hotel in Florence. His life was saved only by removing one of his kidneys. In October 1965, Piaggio was taken ill at work during an industrial dispute. The ambulance taking him to hospital had to make its way through crowds of strikers. Piaggio was released from hospital and died at home ten days later. Thousands of mourners lined the streets as his funeral passed by, including many of the erstwhile strikers.

The fine-toothed leaves are at first deep red, but on maturity become glossy and dark green. The cream-coloured flowers appear in spring, with the male flowers boasting red anthers. Separate shrubs produce either male or female flowers, with the female plants also producing small purple berries. The foliage is dense, and dark-green to red in color. The hardy plant is long-lived. M. africana sends up occasional shoots from its root system that go on to form new plants. It propagates easily from seed.  Uses  Parts of the plant are used in milk and meat-based soups by the Batemi and Masai people of Africa, which is thought to reduce cholesterol levels in tribes that consume large amounts of meat. The flowers are also eaten. Cape myrtle is increasingly popular for topiaries and small hedges, as it can so readily be pruned and shaped.

P. xxxvii (on-line) : https://archive.org/details/a606740200rosmuoft Premise Of the Five Wounds of the Holy Church presupposes an analogy between the Holy Wounds suffered by the Lord's natural Body pierced on the cross, and His mystical body, the Church, pierced by the sins and errors of men in the ages of Christian history. The five main evils of his contemporary Italian Church correspond, in Rosmini's view, to the five wounds of the hands, feet, and side of the Divine Redeemer. Beginning with the wound in Jesus' left hand, he likens it to the lack of sympathy between the clergy and people in the act of public worship, which he sees as a result of a lack of adequate Christian evangelical teaching. This is to be accounted for by the wound in the right hand ‚Äî the insufficient education of the clergy, their secularisation and their alienation from scripture and their bishops. This again was both caused and perpetuated by the great wound in the side, which pierced the Heart of the Divine Sufferer, and which Rosmini sees as a parallel for the divisions among the Bishops, separating them from one another, and also from their clergy and people, forgetting their true union in the Body of Christ. The wound of the right foot is compared to the civil power of the Bishops making them into worldly schemers and politicians, more or less intent on selfish interests. The wound of the left foot is compared to events of the feudal period, when the freehold tenures of the Church were treated as fiefs by an overlord, or suzerain, who saw in the chief pastors of the flock of Christ only a particular variety of vassals or dependants.ROSMINI Antonio, Of the five wounds of the Church, translated and prefaced by Henry Parry Liddon, London 1883. P. xviii (on-line) : https://archive.org/details/a606740200rosmuoft Objectives Rosmini longs for an intelligent union of the clergy and people in public worship, for a well-trained clergy, for an Episcopate united in heart and soul, for a restoration of the primitive method of electing Bishops and for the emancipation of Church property from trammels of feudal tenure.ROSMINI Antonio, Of the five wounds of the Church, translated and prefaced by Henry Parry Liddon, London 1883.

Pilecki volunteered in 1940 to be imprisoned in Auschwitz to organize a resistance movement and send out information about it. His was the first comprehensive record of a Holocaust death camp to be obtained by the Allies. He escaped from the camp in April 1943. The report includes details about the gas chambers, \\"Selektion\\" and the sterilization experiments. It states that there were three crematoria in Auschwitz II able to cremate 8000 people daily. Pilecki's Report preceded and complemented the Auschwitz Protocols, compiled from late 1943, which warned about the mass murder and other atrocities taking place inside the camp. The latter consists of the Polish Major's Report by Jerzy Tabeau, who escaped with Roman Cieliczko on 19 November 1943 and compiled a report between December 1943 and January 1944; the Vrba-Wetzler report; and the Rosin-Mordowicz report. Background On November 9, 1939, after the Polish Army was defeated in the Invasion of Poland, cavalry captain Witold Pilecki together with his commander Major Jan W≈Çodarkiewicz founded the Secret Polish Army (Tajna Armia Polska, TAP). In 1940, Pilecki presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany's Auschwitz concentration camp, gather intelligence on the camp from the inside, and organize inmate resistance. At that time little was known about the Germans' way of running of the camp, as it then appeared to operate as an internment or large prison camp. His superiors approved the plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of \\"Tomasz Serafi≈Ñski\\". On September 19, 1940, he deliberately went out during a Warsaw street roundup (≈Çapanka), and was caught by the Germans along with some 2,000 innocent civilians. After two days' detention in the Light Horse Guards Barracks, where prisoners suffered beatings with rubber batons, Pilecki was sent to Auschwitz and was assigned inmate number 4859. In Auschwitz Inside the camp Pilecki organized an underground Union of Military Organizations (ZwiƒÖzek Organizacji Wojskowej, ZOW), which was connected with other smaller underground organizations. Pilecki planned a general uprising in Auschwitz and hoped that the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp (most likely the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, based in Britain), and that the Home Army would organize an assault on the camp from outside. In 1943, the Gestapo redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, succeeding in killing many of them. Pilecki decided to break out of the camp, hoping to personally convince Home Army leaders about his idea of uprising in Auschwitz. On the night of April 26/27, 1943, Pilecki made a daring escape from the camp, but the Home Army did not accept his insurgency plan, as the Allies considered his reports about the Holocaust exaggerated.  The report  ZOW's intelligence network inside the camp started to send regular reports to the Home Army from October 1940. Beginning in November 1940, the first information about genocide occurring in the camp was sent via ZOW to Home Army Headquarters in Warsaw. From March 1941 onwards Witold Pilecki's messages were forwarded to the Polish government in exile in London and, through it, to the British government and other Allied governments. These reports informed the Allies about the unfolding Holocaust and were the principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz-Birkenau for the Western Allies. On June 20, 1942, four Poles, Eugeniusz Bendera, Kazimierz Piechowski, Stanis≈Çaw Gustaw Jaster and J√≥zef Lempart, made a daring escape from Auschwitz camp.

Hardcover, Wydawnictwo Si√≥str Loretanek, Dressed as members of the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde, fully armed and in an SS staff car, they drove out the main gate in a stolen automobile, a Steyr 220 belonging to Rudolf H√∂ss. Jaster, a member of ZOW, carried with him a detailed report about conditions in the camp, written by Pilecki. The Germans never recaptured any of them. After his own daring escape from Auschwitz on April 27, 1943, Pilecki wrote Raport W. The report was signed by other members of the Polish underground who worked with ZOW: Aleksander Wielopolski, Stefan Bielecki, Antoni Wo≈∫niak, Aleksander Pali≈Ñski, Ferdynand Trojnicki, Eleonora Ostrowska and Stefan Mi≈Çkowski, and it included a section called \\"Teren S\\" which contained a list of ZOW members. Later, after his release from the German Prisoner-of-war camp at Murnau in 1945, Pilecki compiled a version of the report that was over 100 pages long. The first publication of Witold's Report took place in 2000, 55 years after the war. An English translation was published in 2012 under the title The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery.

According to the 2011 census, it had a population of 438 inhabitants. It is the site of the oldest preserved coal mine in Serbia, established in 1853. The mine marks the beginnings of the industrial revolution in Serbia.  History  The coal mine was opened on 11 July 1853 and was operational for almost 120 years. On 13 July 1903, the first mining trade union organization in Serbia was founded in Senjski Rudnik, and already on 6 August they organized the general strike which ended after 9 days with the management accepting to raise wages and to improve working conditions. In 1955, the 6 August was declared a national miners' day. In 1923, the football club \\"Rudar\\" was founded. The cultural center Sokol House was established, which also operated as a cinema from 1934. After World war II, composer , future founder of the popular music in Yugoslavia, was sent to the center to organize the cultural and artistic life in the small town, which together with the neighboring Senje, after which it was named, had some 3,000 inhabitants. Kraljiƒá's piano is exhibited in the local museum. The village had an elementary school. Young engineers were having their practical education in the settlement and participated in economic life, so it was recorded that between 1955 and 1968, the only two major industrial branches which were not represented in Senjski Rudnik were aircraft industry and shipbuilding. There was a large hospital in the settlement, one of the best equipped in the state. Famous military surgeon Izidor Papo performed surgeries in it. However, the mine was soon closed. In 1980, film Petria's Wreath, directed by Srƒëan Karanoviƒá and starring Mirjana Karanoviƒá, was filmed in Senjski Rudnik. The house where it was filmed is today known as the Petrija's House.  Coal mining museum  Remains of Senjski Rudnik coal mine As of 2010, there is an ongoing project, sponsored by the Council of Europe and the Ministry of Culture of Serbia, of restoration of preservation of the mine complex, which will turn the entire site into an open-air museum and historical heritage site. By February 2018, the display included 1,000 exhibits and 5,000 photos and is organized as the Coal Mining Museum (). The industrial heritage complex includes: * Main building; built in 1930, today it hosts the central exhibition which on two levels presents mining history in the region, from the 3rd century until today; * Engineering workshop; it consists of four rooms, displaying the everyday life of the miners and their families; documents show that women worked as miners even decades before World War I, but especially during the war when men were drafted; * Open-air exhibition; hosts exhibits too large for the indoors display: machines, apparatuses, cars, etc. * Mining elevator; the only one of its kind remaining in the world, so it was placed under the state protection; it is still operational; the hoist was constructed in 1872 in Graz, Austria, has hornbeam gear wheels and is steam operated; * \\"Aleksandar's underground mine\\"; entry into the mineshaft and the administrative building above the entry, built in 1860 and completely preserved; * \\"Sokol house\\"; the first Worker's council in Serbia was formed in it; * Church of the Saint Procopius; built in 1900 in memory of the dead miners from the 1893 fire; * Radniƒçka and ƒåinovniƒçka streets; * House of Petrija; * Elementary school \\"Dositej Obradoviƒá\\"; built in 1896; * Lebanese cedar park; named after the Lebanese cedar tree brought from the Mount Athos in 1903; Future additions include the underground museum and restoration of the miners' restaurant which will be used by the tourists. The underground section of the museum is a long abandoned mineshaft. Project is based on the similar facilities in Velenje, Slovenia and Bochum, Germany. The exhibition will be interactive and the visitors would leave the shaft via original mining elevator. In the close vicinity of the museum are the monasteries of Ravanica and Manasija, the Resava Cave and the Lisine waterfall.

The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades assumed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was vengeance for the killing of its leader Raed Karmi.

The film was produced by C. Ashwini Dutt through Vyjayanthi Movies, and the music was composed by Mani Sharma. The follows Sakthi, a tourist guide who accompanies the home minister's daughter Aishwarya and their friends on a journey across various Indian states. Aishwarya has been unwittingly carrying a magical diamond with her, due to which a vengeful Egyptian woman Faqtooni enlists the help of her younger son Bashim and his henchmen. As they try to capture Aishwarya, Sakthi turns out to be her protector and eventually finds himself getting linked to the diamond and its secrets. One of the most expensive Telugu-language films, Sakthi was released on 1 April 2011, with the Tamil dubbed version titled Om Sakthi releasing on 2 April 2011. It opened on more than 700 screens worldwide, receiving worst reviews from critics. Plot Faqtooni, an Egyptian woman, vows to seek revenge for the death of her husband Mukhtar and trains her sons Bashim and Raakha. She wants to retrieve a magical Jwalamukhi diamond and a Rudra trident. Her brother Jaffer reveals that Mahadevaraya, the Home Minister of India, possesses the diamond. In order to retrieve it, they target his daughter Aishwarya who goes on a secret trip with her friends, after unwittingly packing the diamond in her bag. In Jaipur, they meet Sakthi, a tourist guide who comes to their rescue when goons trouble them. Mahadevaraya learns of Aishwarya's escape from home and two police officers are assigned to find her. Mahadevaraya requests his former partner Jackie to hand him over the trident in exchange for his entire wealth, but Jackie declines. While in Kashmir, Aishwarya falls for Sakthi after he saves her life. Later, she is kidnapped by Bashim's henchmen but rescued by Sakthi after a fight. Bashim manages to find out they're now heading to Haridwar, where Sakthi comes across the diamond while taking a dip in the Ganges. A sage senses it and informs Mahadevaraya about the cleansing of the diamond and arrival of Aishwarya's protector. The two cops looking for Aishwarya inform them about her presence in Haridwar. While leaving the city, Aishwarya proposes to Sakthi but he declines. Soon, Bashim and his henchmen attack them but Sakthi, revealed to be an undercover agent, protects everyone and captures Bashim after a huge shootout. On the other hand, Faqtooni tries to retrieve the trident from Jackie but he demands a huge sum. Aishwarya is questioned about the diamond but she doesn't know anything. Sakthi explains to officer Siva, his father, that he went undercover to protect Aishwarya as she was the target of a terrorist group. On the other hand, Raakha is sent to India to rescue Bashim. Aishwarya finds pictures of her in Sakthi's bag, which leads to Sakthi confessing that he loved her from the moment he saw her. Sakthi, along with his parents and Aishwarya, goes to the temple for his birthday and finds the box with the Jwalamukhi and opens it. Siva informs Mahadevaraya and is called to Hampi along with both the diamond and Aishwarya. Raakha attacks the prison and frees Bashim who, having overheard a conversation, tells him Siva is heading to Hampi. Raakha attacks Siva and other officers but is left wounded by Sakthi who gains powers after touching the diamond. At Hampi, Bashim tries to snatch the diamond but is killed by Sakthi with an ancient sword. Proclaiming Sakthi as the protector, the sage explains how Rudra, the protector of a secret Sakthi Peetha, sacrificed his life while protecting his pregnant wife and Mahadevaraya's parents from Mukhtar and his henchmen. Jackie, who was initially known as Janaki Varma, killed Mahadevaraya's parents after being paid by Mukhtar and managed to flee with the Rudra trident. After killing Mukhtar, a dying Sakthi handed over his newborn son to his loyal servant Basava, who sent him away via the river. He was discovered by Siva and his wife and eventually raised by them as Sakthi. Sakthi retrieves the trident after killing Jackie's henchmen, Jaffer and Jackie himself. However, Sakthi is betrayed and shot by Mahadevaraya's partner Prachanda, who then acquires the trident and hands it over to Faqtooni as she arrives with a resurrected Raakha. Mahadevaraya stabs Prachanda to death, and Raakha knocks him unconscious. Faqtooni forcibly takes the sage and Aishwarya to perform the compulsory rites conducted every 27 years, and as Raakha begins destruction, Sakthi arrives and fights using the trident. Faqtooni is thrown into a deep pit, while an indestructible Raakha is killed after the sage instructs Sakthi to stab Raakha in his eyes, which were implanted from Mukhtar's severed head. Mahadevaraya regains consciousness, while Sakthi places the trident back and walks out with the diamond in his hand, accompanied by Aishwarya and the sage.

His principal work is a set of plates for 'The Funeral of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine,' and the Royal entry of his son as the new duke, published at Nancy in 1611. They are from the designs of Claude de La Ruelle and Jean La Hire, and are etched in a slight, spirited manner. One plate has a single horse and rider, out of a large group in a procession, done in a very different style, which is thought to be the first venture into etching of the Nancy court painter Jacques Bellange, now known mainly for his prints. Other noticeable plates of his are a 'View of the large Hall at Stuttgart' (1619), and 'John Frederick I., Elector of Saxony ' (1609). He died in Strasbourg in 1651. The prints of Brentel are etched with a very light point; and his monogram is found on a series of landscapes ornamented with historical subjects and rich borders, and bearing the dates 1617 and 1619. There are proofs of these borders without the landscapes and figures.

Then Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone for the institute on 19 October 2010. It has operated on a campus of near the Hyderabad Central University since moving in October 2017 from a temporary campus in Narsingi. The TIFR Centre for Interdisciplinary Sciences (TCIS) is the first centre of TIFR Hyderabad. The faculty are young and dynamic, and drawn from all the three major branches of the natural sciences and engineering. Nearly a hundred graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and scientific staff already work here on research topics that are carefully chosen across the life sciences, chemistry, physics and materials sciences. Substantial experimental efforts have commenced using tools of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Laser Sciences, Condensed Matter Physics, Synthetic and Biological Chemistry, Cell and Developmental Biology. These experimental efforts are well complemented by wide-ranging theoretical approaches in both Physics and Chemistry. This well-rounded, multi-pronged approach has distinct merits ‚Äì around the world there is increasing cognizance of the fact that some of the most interesting research in solving human problems is done at the frontiers of disciplines using tools from various streams to comprehensively address a scientific question. The department-less structure at TIFR Hyderabad allows scientists to truly understand, engage in and contribute to each other‚Äôs research in ways that cannot be possible in the best of other research institutes in the country. This truly presents a unique opportunity in the context of Indian science.

It was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by Chas Chandler. A football-themed song, it failed to chart on the UK Singles Chart. In 2008, the song was used in a UK TV advert for the football video game Fifa 09. Background Having returned to the UK from the United States in 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour at the time of the UK's Punk rock explosion. Slade's waning success soon led to the band playing small gigs, including universities and clubs, but despite being successful at filling small venues, their new records were barely selling. Although the band's October 1977 single \\"My Baby Left Me - That's All Right\\" had reached the UK Top 40, the successive single \\"Give Us a Goal\\", released in February 1978, was one of a string of singles to fail to chart.We'll Bring the House Down - 2007 Salvo remaster booklet liner notes It had been released to coincide with the band's UK tour during March-April. Having written the tune, the idea for the lyrics of \\"Give Us a Goal\\" came after Holder suggested the band write a song about football as many of the band's fans were also football supporters. For the 1991 video compilation Wall of Hits, Lea recalled: \\"I wrote this tune and Nod said 'Let's do one about football because we've always had this football following\\". I was never really convinced about doing a football song, nevertheless the video was fun.\\"Slade - Wall of Hits - 1991 VHS interview prior to Give Us a Goal video The song was recorded in early 1978. Release \\"Give Us a Goal\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl by Barn Records in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Belgium. It was also released on 12\\" vinyl in Italy, which was Slade's first release on 12\\" vinyl. The B-side, \\"Daddio\\", was exclusive to the single and would later appear on the band's 2007 compilation B-Sides. Promotion In the UK, the band performed the song on the TV shows Cheggers Plays Pop and Get It Together. In Record Mirror, an advertisement for the single featured a cartoon drawing of the band scoring a goal against Lea who appeared as the goalkeeper. Music video A music video was filmed to promote the single, which was shot at Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.'s Goldstone Ground in Hove. It featured shots of the band performing the song in front of a crowd, while other sequences showed the band playing football with the Brighton team. The footage of the band performing the song was shot prior to a home match, while the footage of the band playing football had been filmed a couple of days before during a practice match. On the days of filming, it was so cold that guitarist Dave Hill had to wear a hat, while the band could hardly play football in the weather. The director of the video insisted the film crew keep filming until one of the band members scored a goal against Brighton's goalkeeper. It took a long time for the band to achieve this, with drummer Don Powell scoring the goal. In 1991, Holder recalled: \\"Alan Mullery was the manager at the time and he was shouting to the team from the sidelines, \\"Let them have a kick!\\". I had to take a penalty at one point and could I get the ball in the net? I must have tried ten times and in the end the goalie was rolling on the floor pissing himself laughing.\\" Critical reception Upon release, Record Mirror felt the song had \\"plenty of guts, the typical rasping vocals, all that stuff, but it's missed the goal\\".Record Mirror magazine 4 March 1978 In a review of the band's 1978 concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, New Musical Express writer David Blake described the \\"new anthem\\" as being \\"of considerable interest to rabid footy fans and of no interest to anyone else.\\" Track listing ;7\\" Single # \\"Give Us a Goal\\" - 2:49 # \\"Daddio\\" - 2:30 ;12\\" Single (Italian release) # \\"Give Us a Goal\\" - 2:49 # \\"Daddio\\" - 2:30 Personnel ;Slade *Noddy Holder - lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Dave Hill - lead guitar, backing vocals *Jim Lea - bass, backing vocals *Don Powell - drums ;Additional personnel *Chas Chandler - producer References Category:1978 singles Category:Slade songs Category:Songs written by Noddy Holder Category:Songs written by Jim Lea Category:Song recordings produced by Chas Chandler Category:Hard rock songs Category:1978 songs ","title":"Give Us a Goal"},{"id":"29259085","text":"Eumetriochroa is a genus of moths in the family Gracillariidae.

It is a rather complex mancala game, and bears some similarities to the Layli Goobalay mancala played in Somaliland. Rules=Equipment and gamesetup Enkeshui can be played using a mancala board of different sizes, as long as they have two rows of pits (i.e., it is a \\"Mancala II\\" game). The number of pits in each row may vary; it is usually 8, 10, or 12. 48 seeds are used. As for many traditional mancala games, it is unclear whether the initial setup is fixed or if it may be chosen by an agreement between the players. Anyway, some of the most typical setups for 2x12 and 2x18 boards are like this: :3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 :0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 :4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 :0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 :0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 :4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 Initial race To choose which player will move first, an initial \\"sowing race\\" takes place. Both players take all the seeds from one of their pits and relay-sow them concurrently. The first player who finishes sowing will be the first to play in the remainder of the game. Notice that since the initial race is concurrent, its outcome is quite unpredictable. Thus, each game will actually begin (after the race) with a different initial setup. General play After the initial race, players will take turns. At his turn, the player takes all the seeds from one of his pits and sows them counterclockwise. Depending on where the last seed of the sowing is dropped, the following rules may apply: * if the last seed is dropped in one of the opponent's pits, and this pit is empty, the turn is over; * if the last seed is dropped in a non-empty pit, the sowing will generally go on in a relay-sowing style, with some exceptions related to the \\"bulls\\" (see below). If the initial sowing causes a relay sowing, the player will not be able to capture (see below) for the remainder of the turn. * if the last seed is dropped in an empty pit of the player's row, and the opposite pit is non-empty all seeds in this pit are captured as well as the seed that caused the capture; all captured seeds are removed from the game. Also, if the pit where the last seed was dropped is followed (counterclockwise) by a line of empty pits, each facing a non-empty pit in the opponent's row, then all the seeds in those opponent's pits are captured as well. * if the last seed is dropped in an empty pit of the player's row, and the opposite pit is empty, the turn is over. A couple of additional rules also apply: * if in an individual (not a relay) sowing the player moves across all of the opponent's row (i.e., drops a seed in each of the opponent's pits), he gains the right to choose whether any further relay-sowing will be done clockwise instead of counterclockwise; this privilege only lasts until the player's move is finished; * sometimes, a player may be allowed to make a \\"special\\" move that consists of taking all the seeds from two of his pits and distributing them freely in his row. This will not cause or imply any sowing. Bulls Some pits may become \\"bulls\\". If the last seed of sowing is dropped in a pit holding 3 seeds, the pit becomes a \\"bull\\" belonging to this player. Also, if the last two seeds in sowing are dropped in two pits that hold 2 and 3 seeds, or 3 and 2 seeds, both pits become bulls of this player. Seeds in a bull can never be removed. Every time sowing ends up with the last seed being dropped in a bull, the player's turn is over. Every time sowing ends up in such a way to cause capture (see above), but the seeds that should be captured are in a bull, the capture does not take place and the turn is over. End of the game The game ends when one of the players cannot move anymore, because he has no seeds in his row or because he only has seeds in bull pits. The opponent then captures all the seeds in his row, except for those in bull pits; seeds in bull pits will be captured by the player owning the bull. The player who captured most seeds wins the game. Enkeshui in Maasai culture There are several symbolic elements in Enkeshui rules. The total number of seeds, \\"48\\" (the number of seeds), is considered of good auspice in Maasai culture. The number of pits per row is always even; this is related to the fact that even numbers are considered \\"feminine\\". Most of the game's terminology is based on metaphors that are related to cattle farming: seeds are cows, pits are enclosures, and some pits are \\"bulls\\". Note that the same cattle-based metaphors are used for mancalas found in completely unrelated (but also pastoral) cultures, such as the Mongolian game Unee tugaluulax. Enkeshui games are social events in Maasai's villages. Usually, the game is played by teams; while an individual player must be selected from each team to actually move, the team maintains the right to deny its support to this player (and replace him) and even withdraw his move if there is no consensus over it. Since the rules are quite complex, and Maasais usually play as fast as possible, illegal moves may occur either as a result of a player's mistake or his actual intent to cheat; in either case, it is the opponents' responsibility to detect the illegal move and withdraw it. Non-playing people may also intervene, and often bet on the winner. The system of social rules defining \\"good manners\\" in relation to Enkeshui (both for players and observers) is quite complex and difficult to grasp for young people as well as strangers.

Description=Adult Adults of the genus Phyllocnistis are very small moths with wingspans generally not exceeding 5 mm. Both fore- and hindwings are lanceolate and predominantly white. The forewings are marked with yellow to orange, longitudinal and oblique striae, often bordered by gray or black. A few species are known to possess much darker or strikingly color patterns. The compound eyes of Phyllocnistis are reduced, with an interocular index (vertical eye diameter/minimum interocular distance) of approximately 0.9. The maxillary palpi are the most reduced among Gracillariidae, being barely evident as vestigial, non-segmented lobes at the base of the elongate proboscis. The wing venation is also reduced. Larvae The larvae of Phyllocnistis are among the most specialized Lepidoptera. Four instars appear to be the norm, with the first three instars possessing a sapfeeding morphology and behavior. Sapfeeding instars create a long serpentine, subepidermal mine on either the upper or lower surfaces of the host leaf. A few species also form subepidermal mines on stems and various fruits, including avocado. A characteristic, median frass trail extends the length of the mine, usually as a dark, unbroken line. The fourth instar is a highly specialized, apodal, non-feeding instar whose primary function is to spin the cocoon, at the mine terminus, prior to pupation. Pupae In contrast to the conservative morphology of the larval and adult stages, the pupae of Phyllocnistis are structurally diverse, particularly with regard to the development of the frontal process (cocoon-cutter) of the head. In addition, the mid-dorsal areas of abdominal terga 3‚Äì7 possess a mostly symmetrical cluster of recurved spines that frequently differ in their arrangement and form among species.Davis, D. R. and D. L. Wagner. (2011). Biology and systematics of the New World Phyllocnistis Zeller leafminers of the avocado genus Persea (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae). ZooKeys 97, 39‚Äì73. Ecology Phyllocnistis can be found on many host plants, and have been noted on plants from at least 20 families. One well-known species is the citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella), a pest of plants in the family Rutaceae, especially citrus.Heppner, J. B. Phyllocnistis citrella. EENY-38. University of Florida IFAS. Published 1998, revised 2013. Species As of 2012, about 126 Phyllocnistis species have been described.

He was nicknamed Lo Squalo (\\"The Shark\\"). Biography Sbardella was born in Rome. During his youth, he was a member of a far-right movement, and later was a member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI, a post-fascist party). Later he moved to the Nuova Repubblica movement led by Randolfo Pacciardi. In the early 1970s he entered Democrazia Cristiana (DC).

From Civitates orbis terrarum vol. I, by Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg, 1572 The \\"Shirazi era\\" refers to a mythic origin in the history of Southeast Africa (and especially Tanzania), between the 13th century and 15th century. Many Swahili in the central coastal region claim that their towns were founded by Persians from the Shiraz region in the 13th century. Once accepted as fact, modern research has disproved a Shirazi origin for the Swahili towns, instead emphasizing various social factors that induced claiming this identity. History The most likely origin for the stories about the Shirazi is from Muslim inhabitants of the Lamu archipelago who moved south in the 10th and 11th centuries. They brought with them a coinage tradition and localized form of Islam. These Africans migrants seem to have developed a concept of Shirazi origin as they moved further southwards, near Malindi and Mombasa, along the Mrima coast. The longstanding trade connections with the Persian Gulf gave credence to these myths. In addition, because most Muslim societies are patrilineal, one can claim distant identities through paternal lines despite phenotypic and somatic evidence to the contrary. The so-called Shirazi tradition represents the arrival of Islam in these eras, one reason it has proven so long lasting.Horton, Mark & Middleton, John. \\"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Society.\\" (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 2000) Pg. 59 Extant mosques and coins demonstrate that the \\"Shirazi\\" were not Middle Eastern immigrants, but northern Swahili Muslims. They moved south, founding mosques, introducing coinage and elaborately carved inscriptions and mihrabs. They should be interpreted as indigenous African Muslims who played the politics of the Middle East to their advantage. Some still use this foundation myth a millennium later to assert their authority, even though the myth's context has long been forgotten.Horton, Mark & Middleton, John. \\"The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Society.\\" (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 2000) Pg. 61 The Shirazi legend took on new importance in the 19th century, during the period of Omani domination. Claims of Shirazi ancestry were used to distance locals from Arab newcomers, since Persians are not viewed as Arabs but still have an exemplary Islamic pedigree. The emphasis that the Shirazi came very long ago and intermarried with indigenous locals ties this claim to the creation of convincing indigenous narratives about Swahili heritage without divorcing it from the ideals of being a maritime-centered culture.Meier, Prita. \\"Swahili Port Cities: The Architecture of Elsewhere.\\" (Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University press, 2016) Pg. 101. Heritage One of the most important archeological sites is that of Kaole, north of Dar es Salaam. The remains of the oldest mosque in Southeast Africa can be found there. Royal House There is an extant Imperial Persian royal line that retain the title of Wa-Shirazi Sultans including the Sultanate of Hamamvu of the Comoros and the Sultanate of Aldabra (the current incumbent being Viknesh Sounderajah).

The previous major review of UK defence strategy was the Strategic Defence Review, published in 1998, and updated in 2003 by the Delivering Security in a Changing World white paper. As well as wanting an updated security policy, both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats wanted the ¬£38 billion overspend in the Ministry of Defence (MoD) procurement budget addressed. With the government committed to reducing the national budget deficit, the Treasury asked the MoD to draw up options for a 10-20% real-terms cut in its budget. The final amount was a 7.7% reduction over four years.  Formation Summary The number of Challenger 2 tanks would be cut by 40%. All three of Britain's armed forces would take cuts in manpower. Overall, the largest overseas deployment was expected to be not more than 30,000 personnel, including maritime and air force units. This compares to the 45,000 involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In November 2010, the MoD released its plan to implement the changes. Royal Navy * Personnel to be reduced by 5,000 to 30,000. * One of the Albion class landing platform dock ships to be in extended readiness at any given time. Later confirmed that would be put into extended readiness until 2016, and went into extended readiness thereafter. * Either or to be decommissioned, whichever is least capable as a helicopter carrier. It was announced in December 2010 that would be retained and would be withdrawn from service in 2014. * One of the landing ship dock vessels would be decommissioned. The Bay-class landing dock was subsequently sold to the Royal Australian Navy in January 2011 for ¬£65 million. * The number of warheads carried on each submarine to be reduced from 48 to 40, and the number of operationally available nuclear warheads to be reduced from about 160 to no more than 120. * The decision on replacement of the UK's nuclear deterrent, based on the Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines, to be delayed by four years, deferring ¬£500 million in spending. Changes to the size of the missile tubes to save ¬£250 million. * Seven submarines to be built as planned. * The surface fleet of frigates and destroyers to be reduced to 19 ships: the current 13 Type 23 frigates and the six active Type 45 destroyers. The remaining four Type 22 frigates: 2011, 2011, 2011, and 2011 (all four were subsequently sold for scrap, with Cornwall going to Swansea and the other three to Leyal, Turkey) and five Type 42 destroyers: 2011, 2011, 2012, 2012, and 2013 would be disposed of \\"as soon as possible after 2020\\", and the Type 23 frigates would be replaced by new Global Combat Ships. * The Wildcat (Super Lynx) to be the main naval strike helicopter in the future, along with the Merlin. * A UK Response Force Task Group to be established. =Carrier Strike= Harrier GR9 was retired in order to maintain the Tornado as the RAF's main strike aircraft until the Typhoon matured. The latter and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II would constitute the RAF's fast jet fleet in the future. The SDSR called for the almost immediate decommissioning of the Royal Navy flagship aircraft carrier, , rather than in 2016 as scheduled. This occurred on 11 March 2011. The Report also announced the early retirement of the Joint Force Harrier aircraft, the Harrier GR7/GR9. Both of these measures were to save money for the purchase of the aircraft carriers. The Harrier fleet made its last operational flights in December 2010. In 2011 72 British Harriers were sold to the United States to be used for spares. The SDSR proposed that one of the two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers currently under construction would be certain to be commissioned, with the fate of the other left undecided. It had been suggested that only one carrier, routinely equipped with 12 fast jets, was to be in service at any one time, with the other carrier held in extended readiness. These plans were to be reviewed in 2015. However, in May 2014 it was announced by Prime Minister David Cameron that the second carrier, , would be brought into service alongside . He confirmed the second vessel was already 40% built. The SDSR announced the government's intention to switch its purchase of F-35Bs to the carrier-variant F-35C to allow for a wider range and weapons to be used. However, in May 2012 this decision was reversed, and the F-35B was chosen instead, as the previous government had intended. This was because the cost of converting the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers to accommodate the carrier-variant F-35C had risen to twice the original estimate. British Army * Personnel to be reduced by 7,000 to 95,500 by 2015. To take place within the overall mandate of reducing the army's size to 82,000 regular personnel and 30,000 reservists by 2018. * The withdrawal of all 20,000 British troops from bases in Germany by 2020. * The number of Challenger 2 tanks to be cut by 40% to just over 200. * The number of AS-90 self-propelled heavy artillery guns to be cut by 35% to an estimated 87. Royal Air Force The Nimrod MRA4 was cancelled and all airframes scrapped. * Personnel to be reduced by 5,000 to 33,000. * After long delays, technical difficulties, and a total cost of ¬£3.2 billion, the Nimrod MRA4 maritime patrol aircraft project was scrapped. RAF Kinloss, where the aircraft were to be based, ended its 73-year association with the RAF on 26 July 2012 when it was transferred to the Army. * Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft procurement to go ahead, to replace the ageing VC10 and TriStars. The VC10 made its final flight in RAF service on 20 September 2013. * The purchase of 22 Airbus A400M military transport aircraft was confirmed, with the aircraft to operate alongside the RAF's eight C-17s. *The C-130J fleet to be retired by 2022, ten years earlier than planned. * The proposed purchase of 12 additional Chinook helicopters ‚Äì a cut to the original order for 22. However, in 2011 the Ministry of Defence signed a contract for 14 Chinooks. * The RAF's future fast-jet fleet to be based on the Typhoon and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, with the latter also to be flown by the Royal Navy. * The Sentinel R1 ground surveillance aircraft would be retired when it was no longer required to support forces in Afghanistan. The utility of the aircraft in deployments over Libya and Mali has led to some calls for the retention of the aircraft. Criticism On 3 August 2011, the House of Commons Defence Select Committee published a critical review of the SDSR. The review led to wide-ranging cuts to the Armed Forces, which were widely criticised for damaging the capabilities of the British military.

It is a brick Collegiate Gothic building constructed in the early 20th century. In 2008 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Calvary was the successor to another Methodist church that had met for years in Albany's Mansion neighborhood closer to the city's historic core. The church's members were forced to move in 1912 when the city acquired its land to build a new school. They found a new site in the developing Pine Hills neighborhood in the western areas the city, where streetcar lines had just been extended. The church helped establish the new suburban neighborhood, providing it with a center and focal point after the original developer went bankrupt. The building remains largely intact. Later the congregation merged with another church, St. Luke's. In 1994 they merged again with another Pine Hills Methodist church and took their current name. In the early 2000s the church developed an extensive program for helping refugees and immigrants from Africa and Asia resettle in the Albany area. Buildings and grounds The church is located on the northwest corner of the intersection, two blocks south of Madison Avenue (U.S. Route 20). To the north and west are similarly large commercial and institutional buildings. Across North Lawrence to the east is a Price Chopper supermarket with a large parking lot and some pad site commercial buildings. South of the church, across Morris, are several blocks of large late 19th- and early 20th-century one- and two-family homes. It occupies the entire lot between Morris and Yates streets, at the edge of a small commercial area, along with a parsonage that is not considered a contributing resource to the National Register listing. Most of the lot has been cleared, though some tall mature shade trees remain along the western bound. Exterior At the south end of the lot is the main building. It is a one-story brick structure on a high, exposed basement. Atop is a tall, steep gabled roof with a parapet. A three-story bell tower is attached to the southeastern corner. On the west (rear) is the parish hall, a gabled structure perpendicular to the main block. Below the water table the brick is laid in common bond; above it is switches to English bond, with the header course every sixth row. Buttresses with stone trim divide the bays, four on the north facade and five on the south. Each bay has a Gothic-arched stained-glass window with stone surround. Two larger buttresses on the east (front) flank the tall five-part stained glass window in a pointed arch. A small rectangular window is on the north side. Concrete steps with a brick facing lead up from the sidewalk on the south corner to the main entrance just north of the tower. The parish hall wing has a similar treatment as the main block. Some of its rectangular casement windows have stained glass. They and the wooden doors are mostly original. Two large buttresses project at 45-degree angles from the corners of the bell tower. A pair of narrow rectangular windows with stone trim are on the south face of the tower at the first story. Similar windows are on both the south and east of the second story, inside a slightly recessed area that also includes the arched louvered vents around the bells, again with stone trim. Above them, at the tower's flat roof, is a stone belt course and plain parapet. Interior A stone architrave similar to the other door and window surrounds surmounts the original paired wooden doors at the main entrance. They have their original iron hinges and transom with wooden tracery. They open into a vestibule on the first floor of the bell tower, which in turn opens into the sanctuary. It has beadboard wainscoting and walls of exposed brick, which will eventually be covered with fresh plaster or drywall. On the ceiling are dark wooden planks supported by hammerbeams. The pews are arranged in a gentle arc with center and side aisles. At the rear (west) wall are doors at either end of the side aisles. One leads to the choir space, the other to the parish hall wing. Its interior has a large central parlor with smaller rooms around it used for classrooms and meetings, as well as bathrooms and closets. They are mostly finished in their original plaster. The basement of the main block similarly is a large central space surrounded by smaller rooms. History The church began as the Ferry Street Methodist Episcopal Church. It eventually moved to Trinity Place and Westerlo Street in what is now Albany's Mansion neighborhood, south of downtown. At that point it became the Ashgrove Methodist Episcopal Church, building there in 1863 on the site of a former mansion. Across the street from the church was Public School 14. In 1912 the city decided to build a new school building, and chose the land occupied by Ashgrove. The church decided to move to a new location, with the section of Westerlo west of the intersection renamed Ashgrove Place in its honor. In looking for a new location, the church followed general trends of Albany's population and development at that time. From the city's founding by the Dutch in the late 17th century to the Civil War a half-century earlier, it had remained within an area one mile (1.6 km) west of the Hudson River and two (3.2 km) along it, the area still the city's core. The development of horsecar lines had allowed the population to settle in undeveloped areas. In 1890, those were upgraded to electric streetcar lines, and extended further. One such extension was along Madison Avenue. The Albany Land Improvement Company was founded the same year to subdivide a large parcel around the junction of Madison and what is today Western Avenue, the eastern end of the First Great Western Turnpike, a toll road built almost a century earlier. It named the area Pine Hills. The company failed after two years, but construction continued. St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, two blocks away, was started in the area from central Albany in 1897 as a mission church. Along with the new Calvary Methodist Episcopal Church, its building larger than that had previously been housed in, were institutions that stabilized the growing suburban neighborhood. In 1994, the church, already merged with another Pine Hills congregation, merged again with another one and renamed itself again as Emmaus United Methodist Church, after the village where Jesus appeared to two of his disciples after his resurrection. Beliefs and programs Emmaus believes in \\"God's action in our lives and our community\\". It therefore says members \\"must live open to faith, not trapped by worldliness\\". Active participation in, and service to, both the church community and the outside community is strongly encouraged. The church is particularly known for its services to African and other refugees in the Albany area. In 2007 it was selected by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants to host 17 survivors of the 2004 massacre of Banyamulenge people at the Gatumba refugee camp in Burundi. \\"We fell in love with them,\\" said Denise Stringer, pastor at the time. The refugees found the church community, and Albany, welcoming and healing. That summer they organized a memorial ceremony in Voorheesville, west of Albany, for all the Gatumba survivors who were resettled in the United States. Out of that experience the church founded Refugee and Immigrant Support Services ‚Äì Emmaus (RISSE). It serves new arrivals from other countries and cultures with programs such as English-language instruction, liaison with human-services agencies, child care and paperwork support. Since its founding the program has grown to include immigrants from Asia as well. \\"Emmaus is now a multi-language, multi-cultural congregation\\", said The Rev. Holly Nye, immediate past pastor, in 2009. Other church programs include a youth ministry and food pantry.

The fort is an important landmark and monument in Sarawak's history which goes back to the Brooke Dynasty. The fort, built in the style of an English castle, was designed to protect Kuching from being attacked by pirates. It served as a Police Museum from 1971 before being handed over to the Government of Sarawak and now is a tourist attraction in Kuching. The fort now houses the Brooke Gallery, an exhibition showcasing the history of Sarawak under the Brooke Dynasty. It is situated across the Sarawak River near The Astana, the official residence of the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak and is accessible by road. It is a 15-minute drive along Petra Jaya, or a short river cruise from Pangkalan Batu, in front of Main Bazaar on Kuching Waterfront and located next to the New Sarawak State Legislative Assembly Building. It is part of the Kuching Heritage Trail.  History  Fort Margherita is named after Brooke's beloved wife, Margaret Alice Lili de Windt, whom he married at Highworth, Wiltshire on 28 October 1869; she was raised to the title of Ranee of Sarawak with the style of Her Highness upon their marriage. The fort was built on a hill overlooking the Sarawak River and situated on the north bank opposite the then fast expanding town centre of Kuching. The fort was well equipped to protect the capital from river-borne invasions.  Features  The three-storey tower block's battlement includes a watchpoint on top, a courtyard surrounded by a high wall with sharp glass shards inlaid for protection, and set into the wall itself are wooden windows from where the cannons were fired. Executions of prisoners were carried out in this courtyard, right up to the Japanese occupation during World War II.

It is eaten in both Finland and Sweden. The semolina is cooked with the berries and also some kind of sweetener.

Alternatively, the pot the porridge was made in, can be put in the kitchen sink, partially filled with water and whisk it in there, so it cools down while being whisked with a hand mixer. The dessert is usually served with milk and optionally sugar. Other berries and fruit that can be used are redcurrants, cranberries, apricots, gooseberries and strawberries.

Sturgis' structure was meant to embody the ideals of his mentor, Ralph Adams Cram, which valued the English Gothic styles as ideal for Episcopal and Anglican worship since such buildings were where it had originally been practiced. Accordingly, it is modeled in part on St. Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire, England, and a Roman brick from that location was placed in the hyphen between the church and the parish hall. But it is not an exact copy, and Sturgis himself described it as \\"an attempt to express fundamental truths in a new way to tell an old, old story in new words\\". It is considered one of the best examples of the 20th-century Late Gothic Revival style in Albany. Building The church occupies the western half of the block of North Main between Madison on the south and Western Avenue on the north, two blocks east of where those streets split, in the Pine Hills neighborhood. The College of St. Rose is immediately to the east, with the surrounding buildings on all sides either large institutional buildings or apartments or single-family houses. The terrain is generally level. Three buildings comprise the church complex. The largest is the combined church‚Äìparish house, with the latter joined to the former at a corner. In the eastern corner of the lot is the rectory, also a contributing resource to the National Register listing. A small garage, which was considered too modern to contribute to the listing, was torn down in 2011. A parking lot is in the southeast corner of the property, and a small grove of mature shade trees on the southwest. The church is built of brown granite with limestone trim. It has three parts: a two-story main block with gabled roof, wings on either side with shed roofs, and a one-story projecting entrance pavilion on the south (front) facade. A wide square bell tower rises to three stories from the rear; it has gabled pavilions on the east and west as well. Exterior decoration is minimal. The double-doored main entrance, on the south pavilion, is located within a deeply recessed lancet arch with a molded head flanked by piers topped with cusped niches. It is flanked by two metal lantern-style lights. Above it is a parapet in the pavilion's flat roof. Two large buttresses rise from either side, framing the large lancet-arched window in the gable field. A stone cross is at the apex. The main roof and the gables on the bell tower are tiled; the shed roofs are metallic. Paneled wooden doors open into an anteroom, from which another set, flanked by single wooden doors that correspond to the side aisles, lead to the sanctuary. The high and narrow nave has an arcade; the chancel is even narrower. Flooring is wood beneath the pews and stone elsewhere. All interior furnishings are of white oak. Windows are set with stained glass. The ceiling is framed in Douglas fir, solid except for the trusses, made of curved and straight members bolted together. Half-timbers form a crossing pattern on the ceiling. There are 32 stained glass windows. A columbarium is located on the east wall, with a baptismal font on the west. The east wing of the chancel serves as a small chapel. In the hyphen beneath the bell tower, connecting the church and parish house, there is a Roman brick from the site of St. Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire, England. The parish hall is a two-story structure faced in light brick. On its first floor is a large meeting hall, bathrooms, the rector's office and a cloakroom. The second floor has classrooms for Sunday school. In the basement is a smaller meeting room, more classrooms, and the heating plant for the building. To the northeast of the church and parish hall is the rectory. It is a two-and-a-half-story timber frame house in the Colonial Revival style, topped by a hipped roof with central gable. Along its north (front) facade, facing Western Avenue, is a full-length porch. The Rectory is currently empty. History William Croswell Doane, elected the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Albany upon its 1868 creation, saw the potential for growth of the church in places it had not previously been. Encouraged by that, in 1892 St. Paul's Church on Lancaster Street established the St. Andrew's Chapel in an old bank building on Madison Street, at the end of a trolley line in an area where the city was beginning to expand west from the core downtown areas where it had flourished since being settled by the Dutch in the 17th century. It was soon moved to the former School No. 4 building on Ontario Street. Two years later, that space had been outgrown. A new chapel was built for $10,000 ($ in modern dollars) in 1897 on Western Avenue near North Main, the same space occupied by the rectory today. Two years later, in 1899, the chapel petitioned the diocese to separate itself from its parent church, since its congregation was increasingly composed of residents of the area who had no historical connection to the founding church. It was granted later that year and St. Andrew's became its own parish, after agreeing to assume some of the financial obligations that had previously been St. Paul's. Growth continued. The chancel of the new church was enlarged in 1901. It was still not large enough to handle the expanding congregation. In the late 1910s, the parish began planning for a new building. It bought the land south of the church in 1920 and began a fundraising campaign. Eventually it was able to accumulate enough money and on St. Andrew's Day, November 30, 1930, the cornerstone was laid. It was completed in time for dedication ceremonies the following Easter, at a cost of $250,000 ($ in modern dollars). Architect Norman Sturgis designed the church to reflect the values of his mentor, Ralph Adams Cram, for whom he had worked as a draftsman after graduating from Harvard University's School of Architecture in 1913. Cram's own Episcopal churches had hewed closely to the Gothic designs of historic churches in England, which he deemed the only proper mode for Episcopal buildings. But at the same time he believed that style should be interpreted in modern ways, and the buildings not be mere copies of English originals. This style, as interpreted by Cram and others, became known as Collegiate Gothic since many of its exponent buildings were located on college campuses. alt=A stone building similar to the church, seen from the same angle, but larger and more ornate Upon its completion, Sturgis described St. Andrew's as \\"an attempt to express fundamental truths in a new way to tell an old, old story in new words.\\" Its English model was the St. Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. Many of the craftsmen hired to build the church were local to Albany as the church was trying to help ease the effects of the Great Depression, which had just begun. Despite difficulties raised by World War II, the mortgage was finally paid off and burned in 1947. Bishop Ashton Oldham consecrated the church not long afterwards. With its status now secure, in the 1950s the church began improving its physical plant. In 1956 the original 1897 church, which had been serving as the parish house, was demolished to allow the construction of the attached building that presently serves the same purpose. Its architects used light brown brick to better blend with the church. A Roman brick from St. Albans Abbey in England, Sturgis' partial model for the church, would later be installed in the hyphen connecting the two. Some time afterwards, the 1900 house that served as the church's rectory was purchased. Echoing its own beginnings and reflecting the further suburban development of the Albany area in the mid-20th century, St. Andrew's established the mission parish of St. Boniface in Guilderland, just outside the city, in 1961. Nine years later, in 1970, the church bought and installed a new organ. In 1979 a thrift shop, The Shop at St. Andrew's, was opened. The most recent change to the church has been the installation of the columbarium in 1992, for which some of the original pews were removed. Programs The church holds services on Sunday mornings and Tuesday evenings. Both Sunday services are Holy Eucharist, with the earlier one held in the chapel with a purely spoken liturgy and the later service using the whole church and music. Both use Rite Two from the Book of Common Prayer. Sunday school is also offered during that time. Tuesday's Eucharist and Intercessions service is often led by members of the congregation. St. Andrew's offers many ministry programs. \\"Love Thy Neighborhood\\" dinners are held regularly for the members of the surrounding community. The thrift shop is its major community outreach program, offering items donated by members, primarily clothing. It rents space to groups from the college and elsewhere in the community.

Triflin reduces high potassium-induced smooth muscle contraction, suggesting a blocking effect on L-type calcium channels.  Sources  Habu snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) Triflin is a toxin derived from snake venom. The toxin is produced in the gland of the Habu snake, Trimeresurus flavoviridis.  Chemistry  Triflin is a cysteine-rich secretory protein, which means it belongs to the CRISP family. This is a group of single chain polypeptides found in various organisms. Triflin weighs 25 kDa and consists of 221 amino- acid residues. The first 163 residues of the N-terminal domain forms an Œ±-Œ≤-Œ± sandwich core. This domain is comparable with group 1 plant pathogenesis- related protein (PR-1). The C-terminal domain, has five disulfide bridges. This domain is responsible for the selectivity of the protein and consists of two subdomains: N-terminal subdomain (Cys 167 to Cys 179) and C-terminal subdomain (42 amino-acids residues). The N-terminal subdomain is connected with N-terminal domain through two main-chain hydrogen bonds between Œ≤11 and Œ≤2 and is thereby part of the PR-1 domain. The C-terminal subdomain is stabilized by three disulfide bridges and it is remarkable that this domain does not interact with either the PR-1 domain or the N-terminal sub-domain. The C-terminal subdomain consists of particles, including some hydrophobic residues that are exposed to the solvent. These hydrophobic residues might mediate the interaction with the target proteins and therefore receptor recognition. There are some homologous toxins to Triflin with different percentages of amino-acid sequence similarity, such as Ablomin, Latisemin, Stecrip (88%), Helothermine (49%), Pseudechetoxin (62%), Pseudesin (61%). The snake venoms which belong to CRISP family seem to be homologous to each other, however there are differences in their protein targets.  Target  Triflin reduces high potassium induced smooth muscle contraction, suggesting a blocking effect on L-type calcium channels.  Treatment  One of the small serum proteins (SSP-2), a substance produced by Trimeresurus flavoviridis itself, has high affinity for Triflin, and may thus work as a defensive mechanism against accidental self-poisoning, suggesting a possible role for SSP-2 as an antidote to triflin.

Since the late 1960s, he has been in several major soukous bands, such as Zaiko Langa Langa, Isifi Lokole, and Langa Langa Stars. Biography Evoloko was born in Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). He began his career in Zaiko Langa Langa, one of the biggest Congolese soukous bands, in 1969. His talent was so enthusiastically acclaimed by the public that he quickly became the front man and band leader. Along with other musicians together with Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo, Gina Efonge, they created cavacha, a sound and dance style that became a trademark of Zaiko and a craze in East Africa in the 1970s. He wrote the best song of the year in 1973 (Onassis Ya Zaire) and again in 1974 (Eluzam). The huge success of these two songs and the cavacha dance established Zaiko langa langa as the top band for young people in the country. It is safe to say that Evoloko is the recording artist who put Zaiko on the map. He was the best and most prolific song writer in the band, the lead singer, the best dancer. He was the guy who was drawing the crowd, who was electrifying the audience at the band's performances. He was the first recording artist of his generation to reach the superstardom in the country. In 1974 at the top of his career, he left Zaiko and went to form Isifi Lokole with Papa Wemba and Mavuela Somo. The band also included Bozi Boziana, who was another popular soukous star. Mavuela Somo, Evoloko and Papa Wemba eventually argued with each other and Papa Wemba left Isifi Lokole to found his own band Yoka Lokole. Evoloko renamed his band Isifi Melodia. For a while, Isifi Melodia struggled to become a top soukous band. Evoloko later returned to Zaiko, but left again in 1981. He started the band Langa Langa Stars with the financial assistance of Kiamuangana Verckys. The band included several ex-Zaiko Langa Langa and Viva La Musica musicians such as Bozi Boziana and Dindo Yogo. Langa Langa Stars were also very popular, as was their mbiri mbiri dance. They disbanded in 1984. Evoloko recruited new musicians and got some success in 1984 - 1986 with his band. He relocated to Europe around 1989. After Langa Langa Stars, Evoloko kept playing either in solo projects or with other short-lived groups, such as Langa Langa R√©nov√© (2008). He also occasionally collaborated with his original band, Zaiko Langa Langa.

It and an adjacent chapel were built in the mid-19th century in an early Gothic Revival style designed by Frank Wills. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. A small garden surrounding the church and chapel gives it the feel of an English country parish church despite its urban surroundings. Its interior has several stained glass windows designed by John Bolton, brother of William Jay Bolton. A century after its construction the Episcopal congregation moved to a newer church and sold it to a Russian Orthodox church, which renamed it and added an onion dome. They have subsequently moved out and the building remains vacant. Building The church and chapel complex is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of North Pearl and Colonie Street, roughly one half-mile (1 km) north of downtown Albany and a few blocks east of the Arbor Hill neighborhood. It is located at the point where the terrain, flat all the way to the Hudson River one-quarter mile (500 m) away, starts rising to the west, creating a dropoff at the east end of the property. The surrounding neighborhood is mostly residential, showing the varied effects of past urban renewal programs. Across Colonie, to the north, is a large vacant lot and some unused railroad tracks. To the south are some other older commercial and residential buildings. A pair of modern high-rise apartment buildings, with a complex of small, newer ones to their north, are across North Pearl to the west. Some other properties listed on the Register are nearby. The small Broadway‚ÄìLivingston Avenue Historic District, is to the east and southeast, with the Broadway Row a block to the south of it. A block to the southwest is the northern end of the Arbor Hill Historic District‚ÄìTen Broeck Triangle and one of its contributing properties, Ten Broeck Mansion. The church and chapel are connected by a small hyphen. Both buildings are \\"T\\"-shaped two-and-a-half- story structures built of coursed rubble masonry. They are trimmed in Portland stone and topped by steeply pitched slate covered gable roofs. The main church building is currently covered with ivy, obscuring the view of most of its decorative features. At the top of the front is a green onion dome topped with an Orthodox cross. Underneath that vegetation on the west (front) facade are heavy corner buttresses, an arched central entrance, four lancet windows on the second story and a single triangular window in the gable. The nave is five bays long, with an additional entrance at the northeast. A smaller projecting gable on the east with two small shed-roofed wings is the chancel. Inside the church's decor is restrained. Wooden wainscoting runs along the lower portion of the walls. Above there is a small wooden gallery and a beamed ceiling. The original pews have been removed and chairs line the sides. Screens and icons block the view of the altar. A modern counter is next to the entrance. The stained glass and grisaille windows remain. The chapel is a similar, smaller building. The dropoff in the terrain exposes its brick basement in the rear. The wall above it is also brick. Inside, it too has partitions, screens and icons, but it has been extensively renovated. The floor is linoleum and the ceiling has had skylights added. On May 4, 2015, a section of the church collapsed. In December 2016 a developer purchased the church, saving it from possible demolition. The developer reportedly planned to stabilize the structure and eventually open it as a community center or restaurant. In 2019, as no renovations appeared to have taken place, the Historic Albany Foundation placed it on their ‚ÄúDirty Dozen‚Äù list of Albany‚Äôs most endangered historic structures.

Life He was a priest attached to the parish of Poulpearsay, County Wexford, and formerly of Gorey. He apparently joined rebels encamped at the foot of Corrigrua Hill, under the command of Father John Murphy (1753?‚Äì1798), shortly before the battle of Tubberneering, on 4 June 1798. Information given to him helped the rebels to anticipate and frustrate the attack of Major-general Loftus and Colonel Walpole. His bravery at Tubberneering won him a reputation with the insurgents, and when Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey was three or four days later deposed from his command, Roche was elected commander of the rebels encamped at Slyeeve-Keelter, near New Ross. After unsuccessful attempts to intercept the navigation of the river, Roche moved his camp to Lacken Hill, where he remained for some time almost inactive. On 19 June he was surprised, and compelled to retreat from Lacken Hill to Three Rocks, near Wexford. On the following day he intercepted a detachment under Sir John Moore, who was moving up to join in the attack on Vinegar Hill, at a place called Goffsbridge, or Foulkes Mill, near the church of Horetown. His disposition of his forces was skilled, but after a fierce engagement, which lasted four hours, was compelled to fall back on Three Rocks, effecting a retreat in good order. After the battle of Vinegar Hill and the surrender of Wexford, Roche, seeing that further resistance was hopeless, decided to capitulate, and went alone and unarmed to Wexford. On entering the town he was seized, dragged from his horse, kicked and beaten. He was tried by court-martial, and hanged on Wexford bridge on 25 June 1798, along with Matthew Keogh and seven others, and his body thrown into the river.

His move of the headquarters drew resentment from the people of Lu Prefecture, who threw their support behind Li Keyong the military governor of neighboring Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), whose forces eventually defeated his. Fearful that his subordinates were turning against him, he committed suicide.  Background and seizure of Zhaoyi Circuit  It is not known when Meng Fangli was born, but it is known that he was from Xing Prefecture.New Book of Tang, vol. 187. As of 881, he was serving as the defender of Tianjing Pass (Â§©‰∫ïÈóú, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi). That year, while the Gao Xun () the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit was leading his army as part of the Tang campaign to recapture the imperial capital Chang'an ‚Äî which had fallen months earlier to the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, forcing then-reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu ‚Äî Gao was assassinated by the officer Cheng Lin (), who took over the army and returned to Lu Prefecture. Meng, hearing the news, launched an attack against the mutineers and killed Cheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. After Meng killed Cheng, however, he did not remain at Lu Prefecture, and instead took his army and returned to his home Xing Prefecture. The people of Lu supported the eunuch Wu Quanxu () to serve as acting military governor. Meanwhile, in 882, the overall commander against Huang, the former chancellor Wang Duo, issued an edict in Emperor Xizong's name making Meng the prefect of Xing. Meng refused to accept the commission, and further put Wu under arrest, claiming that a eunuch could not be an acting military governor. He wrote Wang, requesting that a civilian official be made the military governor. Wang made the official Zheng Changtu acting military governor. Subsequently, Emperor Xizong commissioned Wang Hui to be the new military governor, but Wang Hui, not wanting to travel far to his post and knowing that Meng had control of the three Zhaoyi prefectures east of the Taihang Mountains (Xing, Ming (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), and Ci (Á£ÅÂ∑û, also in modern Handan)) anyway, declined to report to Zhaoyi, and instead recommended Zheng. Emperor Xizong agreed, making him instead the director of Chang'an's reconstruction. Zheng reported to Lu, but left after less than three months, leaving Meng in effective control of the circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.  Movement of headquarters to Xing and subsequent warfare  Meng Fangli thereafter moved the circuit headquarters from Lu Prefecture to Xing Prefecture and claimed the title of acting military governor. He made his officer Li Yinrui () the prefect of Lu. (He was apparently then made military governor, as he was later referred to by that title.) Further, to weaken the power of Lu, as he believed that the people of Lu had a history of overthrowing the military governor, he forced the officers and the wealthy to move their families to the three prefectures east of the Taihang. Knowing that the people of Lu were distressed about these acts, the eunuch monitor Qi Shenhui () had the officer An Jushou () secretly write Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit, who had a powerful army, to ask for his intervention. In response, in winter 883, Li Keyong sent his officer He Gongya () to attack Meng, but Meng defeated He Gongya. Li Keyong then sent his cousin Li Kexiu (), who was able to capture Lu and kill Li Yinrui, taking it over. This started years of warfare between Li Keyong and Meng over the control of Zhaoyi, laying waste to the circuit. In fall 884, at Li Keyong's request, Emperor Xizong named Li Kexiu the military governor of Zhaoyi, thus leaving Zhaoyi with two contending military governors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Meanwhile, because of a dispute between Meng's subordinates Ma Shuang () the prefect of Ming and Xi Zhongxin () the commander of the Zhaoyi forces, Ma rebelled in summer 885 to try to force Meng to kill Xi. However, Ma was soon defeated, and fled to neighboring Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan). Meng then sent a gift to Weibo's military governor Le Yanzhen and persuaded Le to kill Ma. In fall 886, Li Kexiu launched a major attack against Meng, capturing a number of cities east of the Taihang and commissioning his officer An Jinjun () as the prefect of Xing. In 888, Meng tried to counterattack by having Xi attack Hedong's Liao Prefecture (ÈÅºÂ∑û, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi). Li Kexiu defeated and captured Xi, delivering him to Li Keyong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257.  Defeat and death  In summer 889, Li Keyong launched a major attack against Meng Fangli, sending Li Hanzhi and Li Cunxiao against him. Li Keyong's forces soon captured Ming and Ci Prefectures. Meng sent the officers Ma Gai () and Yuan Fengtao () to resist, but Meng's forces were defeated at Liuli Slope (ÁêâÁíÉÈôÇ, in modern Xingtai), with Ma and Yuan captured. Li Keyong then put Xing Prefecture under siege. As Meng was suspicious of the officers, the officers resented him, and they were no longer obeying him by this point. In distress, he committed suicide. The soldiers supported his brother or cousin Meng Qian () as the acting military governor, but Meng Qian, after some resistance, surrendered, leaving Li Keyong in control of a reunified Zhaoyi Circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.

Founded in 1869 with a legacy from the composer Gioachino Rossini, the conservatory officially opened in 1882 with 67 students and was then known as the Liceo musicale Rossini. By 2010 it had an enrollment of approximately 850 students studying for higher diplomas in singing, instrumental performance, composition, musicology, choral conducting, jazz or electronic music. The conservatory also trains music teachers for secondary schools and holds regular master classes. Its seat is the 18th century Palazzo Olivieri‚ÄìMachirelli on the Piazza Oliveri in Pesaro. Amongst its past Directors are the composers Carlo Pedrotti, Pietro Mascagni, Riccardo Zandonai and Franco Alfano. Mascagni's opera Zanetto had its world premiere at the conservatory in 1896. History Carlo Pedrotti, the first Director of the conservatory In his will, Rossini left virtually his entire estate to Pesaro, his native city, for the establishment of a free music school there with the provision that the legacy would only come to the city upon the death of his widow, Olympe P√©lissier.Senici (2004) p. 24 In 1869, the year following Rossini's death, the city set up the association which would eventually become the \\"Liceo musicale Rossini\\". Olympe P√©lissier died in 1878. Four years later, on 5 November 1882, the school opened the doors of its temporary home in the former Convent and Church of San Filippo Neri to the first cohort of 67 students, of whom 25 were enrolled in the choral school.The church, once the tallest building in Pesaro, and the attached convent on 44 Via Petrucci were closed in the mid-19th century and had been purchased by the City of Pesaro in 1862. Following the terms of Rossini's will, the school emphasised operatic and choral singing as well as composition. Its first Director, Carlo Pedrotti, was the composer of 17 operas and had previously been the Director of Turin's opera house, the Teatro Regio. He was also a noted voice teacher. Amongst his pupils were the tenors Francesco Tamagno and Alessandro Bonci. During Pedrotti's tenure, the conservatory moved to its permanent home in the Palazzo Olivieri‚ÄìMachirelli and an auditorium was added which now bears his name. Following Pedrotti's retirement in 1893, the conservatory was without a director until the appointment two years later, of another opera composer, Pietro Mascagni. Pietro Mascagni in 1902, his final year as Director of the conservatory Mascagni took up his post in December 1895. Thanks to Rossini's large legacy, the school was well endowed financially. Mascagni's annual salary was 12,000 lire, more than twice that of the much older Parma Conservatory, and was supplemented with a lavish rent-free apartment in the Palazzo Olivieri‚ÄìMachirelli.Mallach (2002) p. 108 Despite its large endowment, the conservatory had made little progress in raising its prestige during the Pedrotti years and was overshadowed by the big conservatories of Milan, Rome, and Naples and even the smaller Parma Conservatory. It had yet to produce any musicians of note and its enrollment had only increased from the initial 67 students to 73. Its location in a small sea-side town also made it relatively less attractive to the more gifted students and distinguished teachers who tended to prefer the conservatories located in major cultural centres. Mascagni was eager to change the situation and to implement his own ideas about what conservatory education for young people should be. He was opposed to the methods used in many Italian conservatories at the time which taught music largely by rote memorization or as he put it, \\"like a catechism.\\" Within three years, Mascagni had started the Liceo Symphony Orchestra, which included both students and faculty and was the first permanent orchestra to be established in an Italian conservatory.Mallach (2002) p. 109 Mascagni himself conducted their concerts. The orchestra also played in the world premiere of his opera Zanetto, which he had completed shortly before taking up his post. Two students from the conservatory sang the leading roles, and went with Mascagni when he took the opera to La Scala. He also established the first conservatory-published music journal in Italy, La cronaca musicale, as well as the first conservatory course specifically devoted to sacred music. Within four years, the faculty had grown and the enrollment had doubled, as had the number of diplomas awarded. However, by 1900 Mascagni's relationship with the governing board of the school had begun to sour, partly due to his frequent absences for conducting tours and the preparations for the premiere of his opera Le maschere, and partly due to his abrasive treatment of local dignitaries. He had also run up fairly large deficits in the previous two years, and the board had taken over the financial management of the conservatory. Budget cuts in 1902 led to a student rebellion in support of Mascagni. In turn, the board closed the conservatory for the remainder of the year and sent the students home. On 20 January 1903, Mascagni was officially dismissed from his post.Mallach (2002) p. 158 It was another two years before a new Director was appointed. In a 1903 address, the President of the governing board recommended that the next Director not be an opera composer because an opera composer \\"in addition to being steeped in liberties, has his mind always focused on his own compositions and all of the interests that flow from them.\\"Tullio Cinotti, a local soap manufacturer and President of the governing board of the conservatory, quoted in Mallach (2002) p. 149 In 1905, Amilcare Zanella, a pianist and composer of instrumental music was appointed as Mascagni's successor, a post he was to hold for the next 35 years.Waterhouse With the appointment of Riccardo Zandonai as Director in 1940, the school was once again led by an opera composer. (Zandonai, whose most well-known opera is Francesca da Rimini, had been a pupil of Mascagni at the conservatory.) Under Zandonai, the governance of the Liceo passed from the city of Pesaro to the Italian Ministry of Education. Zandonai was followed by another opera composer, Franco Alfano, who held the Directorship from 1947 to 1950. The conservatory produced or participated in a number of opera productions during the 20th century, including Il barbiere di Siviglia (1916), La gazza ladra (1941), Le Comte Ory (1942) and later Orfeo ed Euridice, Suor Angelica, Gianni Schicchi, Il Signor Bruschino, Francesca da Rimini, and Dido and Aeneas. In 1999 the school was designated by the Italian government as an \\"Istituto Superiore di Studi Musicali\\" (Higher Institute of Musical Studies) with university status, one which it holds to the present day.Conservatorio Statale di Musica \\"Gioachino Rossini\\", Presentazione e storia (in Italian).

Accessed 19 October 2010. The conservatory offers bachelor and master diplomas in singing, instrumental performance, composition, musicology, choral conducting, jazz and electronic music. It also trains music teachers for secondary schools and holds regular master classes and seminars. Admission to the diploma courses is based on an entrance examination with five ‚Ç¨1000 scholarships awarded annually by the Fondazione Rossini.Fresco by Gianandrea Lazzarini in the Palazzo Olivieri‚ÄìMachirelliThe conservatory has three specialised research laboratories: 20th Century and Contemporary Music; Early Music; and Electronic and Experimental Music (LEMS), which was established in 1971 by the Italian composer Aldo Clementi. There are several permanent ensembles in which both students and faculty participate, including the Symphony Orchestra, Wind Orchestra, Jazz Orchestra, Saxophone Ensemble, and Gregorian Choir. The ensembles and soloists perform a variety of public concerts in Pesaro and the surrounding region during the year, including those celebrating Christmas, Easter, Ferragosto, May Day, Festa della Repubblica, and Saint Cecilia's Day. The conservatory also co-produces Progetto Orfeo, an international university festival of opera and musical theatre,Programme: Progetto Orfeo , 2009 (in Italian). Accessed 19 October 2010. and runs two national music competitions, Harpsichord (established in 1991) and Bassoon (established in 2004). Palazzo Olivieri‚ÄìMachirelli The Palazzo Olivieri‚ÄìMachirelli on the Piazza Olivieri is home to both the conservatory and the Fondazione Rossini, a centre for Rossini scholarship which organizes the annual Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro. The neo-classical palazzo with its monumental central staircase was built in 1794 for Annibale Olivieri, a member of a noble Pesarese family. It was designed by Gianandrea Lazzarini, who also painted the frescos adorning several of the ceremonial rooms, now often used for chamber music concerts. It includes a gallery of illustrious men and women from Pesaro's history.Tourism office of Pesaro.Peri The building was acquired by the city of Pesaro in 1884, initially to house the Biblioteca Oliveriana and its collections, and gradually adapted by 1892 for use as a music conservatory, including an extension to accommodate an 800-seat concert hall, now known as the Sala Pedrotti. Rectangular in shape with a raised stage, stalls and two tiers of balconies, the Sala Pedrotti is one of the few \\"shoebox\\" concert halls in Italy and is known for its good acoustics.Fausti, Farina, and Pompoli (1995) pp. 453‚Äì456 It was inaugurated on 29 February 1892 with a concert conducted by Carlo Pedrotti to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Rossini's birth. In addition to the concert hall, teaching rooms, and offices, the palazzo houses the conservatory's collection of antique and exotic musical instruments and its library. The conservatory library, with 45,000 volumes as well as rare manuscripts and documents dating back to 1500, is one of the largest music libraries in Italy.Sistema Bibliotecario Unificato di Pesaro e Urbino, Biblioteca Conservatorio \\"G.

When he heads to Turkey in an undercover operation, he meets Prashanthi, daughter of Ajay's senior police officer and soon falls in love with her. She initially rejects his advances, so he pretends to give up. However, he is successful in the undercover operation and arrests Nayak's brother Bunty.

On the other hand, an aspiring actor Bokka Venkata Rao and Mallesh Goud are tricked by Ajay with a real estate business deal to exploit his criminal nexus.

Regarding the same, Vaitla said that it would be a romance action film and a majority would be shot in North India using a Super 35. Mahesh's brother Ramesh Babu was a co-producer. Vaitla worked on the script for more than a year and shelved it temporarily for further modification as he felt it became monotonous and resembles his previous work. The film was officially launched on 28 June 2010 in Ramanaidu Studios at Hyderabad. Kona Venkat wrote the dialogues and Gopimohan penned the screenplay. S. Thaman was selected as the music director marking his first collaboration with Vaitla as the latter's regular music composer Devi Sri Prasad had shortage of dates to accommodate. The film was titled Dookudu in mid September 2010 despite initial reports stating that it may be titled Power. Prasad Murella was selected as the cinematographer who walked out after having an argument on the film's sets with Vaitla because of differences. K. V. Guhan was selected to finish the remaining part. Regarding the same, Vaitla said \\"I had made family dramas with Prasad before but in Dookudu, the demand increased from my side and we couldn't get in sync with each other. I liked the photography in Athadu done by Guhan. We gelled and he has done a fantastic job.\\"  Casting  Samantha Ruth Prabhu was selected as the female lead while Sonia Deepti was selected to play the role of her best friend. Srihari was selected for a crucial role but was replaced by Prakash Raj later. Mahesh Babu was reported to be seen as a police officer in the film. Sonu Sood was cast as the antagonist. Earlier, Kajal Aggarwal was rumoured to be the female lead while Daggubati Venkatesh was rumoured to provide a voice-over. Gopimohan denied the latter's inclusion as a rumour while the former's inclusion remained unconfirmed. Ravi Prakash was selected for a supporting role. Brahmanandam and M. S. Narayana were also selected for supporting roles. Parvati Melton was selected for an item number. Meenakshi Dixit was selected for performing the title song. Regarding the limited role of Samantha, Vaitla clarified that a lot depended on the film's subject and it was done mainly to develop the chemistry between the lead pair.  Filming  Principal photography began on 22 October 2010 in Turkey where a few action sequences and a song on Mahesh and Samantha were shot. The schedule lasted till November 2010 and the team returned to India on 10 November 2010. The second schedule was conducted in Dubai. After returning from Dubai, the next schedule began at Hyderabad on 27 November 2010. In mid January 2011, filming then moved to Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Scenes featuring Mahesh, Samantha and Sonia were shot at Levis showroom in Banjara Hills of Hyderabad and the schedule ended on 29 January 2011. Filming continued in Gujarat where a song on Mahesh and Samantha was shot at the Little Rann of Kutch. On its completion on 11 February 2011, the next schedule was planned to be shot in Hyderabad from 15 February 2011 to 3 March 2011. The film's unit planned to leave to Chennai on 24 February 2011 for filming a song but the makers opted to shoot the same along with few scenes at Chiran Fort Club in Hyderabad from the next day. Few chase sequences were shot in Old city area of Hyderabad in mid March 2011. Filming continued at Mumbai from 20 March 2011 after a few action sequences in Ramoji Film City. The film was shot at Padmalaya Studios in late April 2011 after which filming was planned at Switzerland where a song and few scenes were shot. Some scenes were shot in a central jail set erected in Ramoji Film City with which the Hyderabad schedule was completed in mid May 2011. Some comedy and action scenes were shot in the set which was earlier erected for Dhee (2007), Old City and other areas apart from Ramoji Film City. A long schedule was shot in Switzerland later and Mahesh stayed back for taking rest on the schedule's completion and returned on 30 May 2011 to participate in the shoot from the next day. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the film's shoot was delayed multiple times and by late June 2011, 40 days of shoot was pending. Key scenes featuring Mahesh Babu, Brahmanandam, M. S. Narayana and others were shot in a private apartment in Somajiguda in mid July 2011. Few scenes were shot in Jayabheri House in late July 2011. The song \\"Adara Adara\\" was shot at Chiran Fort club in late August 2011 under the choreography of Dinesh. The film's climax sequences were shot in early September 2011 at Tolichowki in Hyderabad. A special set was erected at Ramoji Film City for the shoot of the item number on Mahesh and Parvati Melton which began on 6 September 2011. On its completion, the filming came to an end.  Themes and influences  Many critics have stated that the film's story is inspired by the German tragicomedy Good Bye, Lenin! (2003). Regarding the same, Vaitla said \\"I saw Good Bye, Lenin! when the scripting of Dookudu was 50 per cent complete. It was a coincidence. I had the idea of showing Mahesh in a new way as a young MLA. I also had the idea of the father. Then, Gopimohan came in, and we worked on the script for seven months. It's a multi-layered film and writing the screenplay for it was tough.\\" He added that the idea of how lies are told and you get people to believe them was already shown in his earlier film Ready (2008). He chose father-son relationship in the film as he wanted to show the emotions between them. Apart from that, Vaitla was inspired by other small things from Good Bye, Lenin!. One such inspired sequence is where the protagonist and his team create fake news broadcasts and newspapers for showing them to his father to make the drama believable which includes making N. T. Rama Rao the Prime minister of India in 2011. And, the scene where the protagonist lies to his father about few things without knowing that the latter is aware of the drama is inspired from the climax of Good Bye, Lenin!. A reviewer from Sify felt that some of the scenes and characters are inspired by Mahesh's previous films Athadu (2005) and Pokiri (2006) apart from the Hindi Patiala House (2011). In one of the comedy scenes, M. S. Narayana is seen performing spoofs of Yamadonga (2007), Magadheera (2009), Simha (2010) and Enthiran (2010). According to K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake, authors of the book Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas, the parodies too received positive response.  Music  S. Thaman composed the soundtrack which consists of six songs. Viswa and Bhaskarabhatla penned lyrics of one song each while Ramajogayya Sastry penned lyrics for the remaining songs. In mid June 2011, Thaman planned to record two songs in China and one more song in Czech Republic during the re-recording as some special instruments were not available in India and were exclusively available there. Aditya Music acquired the audio rights. The soundtrack was unveiled by hosting a promotional event at Shilpakala Vedika on 19 August 2011. The event was aired live on MAA TV and on the film's official website from 7:30 pm. The album cover depicts a promotional still of Mahesh Babu from the film's title song. Track listing Reception The soundtrack was successful in its collections. However, it received mixed response from critics. Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India called the film's music impressive. A reviewer from IANS felt that \\"Nee Dookudu\\" and \\"Guruvaram\\" were well shot and composed while the overall music could have been better. Sify wrote \\"Thaman's music sounded average in the theatres, though a couple of numbers ‚Äì 'Guruvaram' and 'Dethadi' ‚Äì could enliven the mood of the spectators. The background score and the music during some romantic moments are dull.\\" IndiaGlitz termed it the first passable album of Thaman and called it a forgettable one.  Release  The distribution rights for Ceded, Nellore, Nizam, Guntur and Karnataka regions were sold for an amount of while the Uttarandhra region distribution rights were sold to Gayathri Films for an amount of .

Parvati Melton's look in the item number was unveiled after the completion of the film's shoot and those stills received positive response. In an interview to Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India, Anil Sunkara said \\"When the pre-release hype was hitting a fever pitch, we (producers) toured all over the state, meeting fan associations and telling them that it was a family entertainer, and distributing merchandise like stickers, badges and ribbons\\". A thanksgiving tour began in Vijayawada where Vaitla, Anil and comedian Siva Reddy promoted the film at Hotel Mid City after which they went to Eluru. The film's success meet was held at Hotel Novotel in Hyderabad on 11 October 2011. Another event was planned at Vijayawada for celebrating the completion of the film's 50-day run. The event was held at Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College grounds on 12 November 2011. Udaya Bhanu hosted the event.  Legal issues  The film was shot at Vikarabad Railway Station on 31 July 2011 after seeking necessary permission to shoot till 5:00 pm with police security. The shoot was called off because of rain and Mahesh left the premises at 4:30 pm. Shortly, seven Telangana Students JAC activists landed at the railway station raising slogans against Samaikhyandra supporters. On seeing them, the crew started preparing to vacate the spot. While they were leaving, the activists started pelting stones at them. Police later dispersed the mob and production manager Rambabu and Ramesh filed a complaint against them. The activists disrupted the screening of the film in six theatres in Ranga Reddy district and accused the unit members for registering false cases against them during the film's shoot at railway station. They entered theatres at Vikarabad, Parigi, Tandoor, Chevella and Shamshabad and asked the managements not to screen the film but were dispersed by the police. Later Rambabu and Ramesh met them and assured them that the cases would be withdrawn immediately. Police protection was given to the theatres screening the film in Hyderabad while the screening was much delayed in many centres in Telangana.

FICUS Inc., released the overseas DVD on 16 March 2012. The film is also available on Disney+Hotstar VIP.  Reception = Critical reception  Suresh Kavirayani of The Times of India rated it 4 out of 5 and wrote \\"Dookudu is a typical Srinu Vytla film with a generous sprinkling of comedy. His narrative manages to keep the audience engaged until the end of the movie. This movie comes as a blessing for not just Mahesh Babu, but also for Tollywood, which is badly in need of a hit, after the recent spate of box office debacles. Srinu Vytla and Mahesh Babu have come out with a winner in Dookudu\\". Bollywood Life stated \\"Dookudu has all the elements of a potboiler ‚Äì the unholy nexus between underworld and politicos, passionate romance, shrill revenge and the glory of father-son relationship. The movie is almost certain to make a box office splash, but if fans are expecting the lofty fizz of Pokkiri, perhaps there is some disappointment in store\\". Sify called the film \\"entertaining\\" and wrote \\"Despite the drawbacks, Dookudu holds the power to lure the crowds, with its commercial values. It is a bonanza to Mahesh Babu's fans and it will not disappoint the family crowds either.\\" IANS rated it 3.5 out of 5 and stated \\"Dookudu is a treat for Mahesh's fans. But others can also enjoy this film for its comedy elements and Mahesh's powerful presence.\\" Vanshika Devuni of Upperstall.com wrote \\"The best thing about the movie is that it comes across as a mass entertainer and makes no attempts to come across as movie or a movie that tries to pretend it is 'hatke'.\\" In contrast, B. V. S. Prakash of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \\"Although, it is a tale of a honest cop who is on the trail of a dreaded don, director Sinu Vaitla relies on a band of comedians like Brahmanandam and M.S. Narayana to sustain audience interests, before his protagonist accomplishes his mission. Audiences have to leave behind their thinking caps at home to enjoy this comic-caper since the screenplay has few gaping holes and is repetitive as well.\\" Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff gave it 2.5 out of 5 and criticised the film's screenplay and logic-defying sequences, but praised Mahesh Babu's performance, calling his role a \\"cakewalk\\" and recommending the film for his fans in particular. Ramchander of Oneindia Entertainment wrote \\"To sum up, Dookudu is just another average entertainer and not in the same league as Mahesh Babu\\"s earlier blockbusters like Athadu and Pokiri\\".  Box office  Dookudu had the largest opening for a Telugu film, and collected a share of 101.1 million and a gross of 125.8 million on the first day of its release.

The film earned a share of 589 million at the worldwide Box office in its lifetime.  Awards and nominations = Legacy  Dookudu became one of the biggest hits in the history of Telugu cinema and was the biggest hit in Mahesh Babu's career by the end of its lifetime run. The film ended the five-year career slump of Mahesh Babu and marked his image makeover. The Times of India called it one of the top ten must watch Telugu films of 2011. The Los Angeles Times wrote a special article about Mahesh and the film's massive collections in United States and called the film \\"The biggest hit you've never heard of\\". After the film's gross crossed 1 billion, Income Tax Department officials conducted a raid on the Jubilee Hills residence of Mahesh as he was rumoured to get a remuneration of more than 120 million for his next projects. The film's success made Samantha Ruth Prabhu one of the most sought heroines in Telugu cinema. Parvati Melton received more offers for performing item numbers post the film's release. Dasari Narayana Rao said the film arrived at the right time and had provided a good amount of relief to the Telugu film industry, which was under a huge loss at that point of time. Samantha auctioned the costumes used by Mahesh in the film for raising funds for the charity organisation \\"Pratyusha\\". Vaitla's next film with Mahesh namely Aagadu (2014), which too was produced by 14 Reels Entertainment and had the same technical crew of this film, was a failure at the box office. The Hindu cited similarities with Dookudu as one of the reasons of the film's failure.  Remakes  Dookudu was dubbed by 14 Reels Entertainment into Tamil as Athiradi Vettai and Malayalam as Choodan in 2013. The film was also dubbed into Hindi as The Real Tiger in 2012. The film was remade into Bengali as Challenge 2 (2012) by Raja Chanda starring Dev and Pooja Bose in the lead roles. The film was also remade into Kannada as Power (2014) by K. Madesh starring Puneeth Rajkumar and Trisha in the lead roles. It marked the latter's debut in Kannada and was also the first Kannada film of 14 Reels Entertainment.

The letters range in date from 1795 to 1821, and illuminate the life of Calvert's plantation household, including the events leading up to and during the War of 1812.Callcott, Margaret Law, Mistress of Riversdale: The Plantation Letters of Rosalie Stier Calvert Retrieved August 17, 2010 Early life Baron Henri Joseph Stier 1743-1821 Rosalie-Eug√©nie Stier was the daughter of a wealthy Antwerp burgher, Henri-Joseph Stier (1743‚Äì1821) and his wife Marie- Louise Peeters. The Stier family fled the Low Countries in 1794 as a French army invaded their home city.Calcott, p.1 Once in America, the family's fortunes would be salvaged from the disasters of European war. Rosalie Calvert would go on to be one of the richest women in America, amassing a large fortune, much of which she managed herself, and she would maintain one of the largest art collections in the country. Riversdale Rosalie Calvert lived at the Riversdale plantation, a five-part, large-scale late Georgian mansion with superior Federal interior, built between 1801 and 1807. Also known as Baltimore House, Calvert Mansion or Riversdale Mansion, it is located at 4811 Riverdale Road in Riverdale Park, Maryland. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Once the manor house and centerpiece of a plantation, Riversdale was built for the wealthy Antwerp burgher Henri Joseph Stier, who lived in the Brice House in Annapolis, Maryland immediately prior to building Riversdale. Stier planned the house in 1801 to resemble his Belgian residence, the Chateau du Mick. Four years later, Stier returned to the Low Countries, leaving the unfinished Riversdale to be completed by his daughter, Rosalie Stier Calvert and her husband, George Calvert, the son of Benedict Swingate Calvert, who was a natural son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. Family life Rosalie and George Calvert had a large family, though four of their children died in infancy or in childhood. Their son Charles Benedict Calvert established the Maryland Agricultural College, now the University of Maryland, College Park, on part of the Riversdale property.

Washington/Custis relations The Calverts were related, through the marriage of George Calvert's sister, to George and Martha Washington. George Calvert's sister, Eleanor Calvert, married Martha Washington's son, John Parke Custis, who was born in 1754 to Martha and her first husband Daniel Parke Custis. John Parke Custis and Eleanor Calvert Custis had four children before his death: Elizabeth Parke Custis (1776), Martha Parke Custis (1777), Eleanor Parke Custis (1779), and George Washington Parke Custis (1781). Rosalie Calvert and George Calvert were thus aunt and uncle to Martha and George Washington's four Custis grandchildren.

Life While young in France he experienced religious persecution for his Protestant religion. He left for England, where he became almost immediately an Anglican. He became a friend of Samuel Clarke, Benjamin Hoadly and William Whiston. De La Roche settled in London and obtained employment from booksellers, mainly devoting himself to literary criticism. Imitating some similar ventures that had been made in Holland, he began in 1710 to issue a periodical, Memoirs of Literature. It was brought to an end in September 1714; there were other issues in 1717. De La Roche, on his own account, was a friend of Pierre Bayle. Early in 1717 he arranged to edit a new periodical, Biblioth√®que Angloise, ou Histoire litt√©raire de la Grande Bretagne, in French and published at Amsterdam; he was still living for the most part in London. The fifth volume of the Biblioth√®que Angloise, dated 1719, was the last he edited. The publisher transferred the editorship in that year to Armand de La Chapelle, giving as a pretext that de La Roche's foreign readers accused him of opposition to Calvinism, hostility to the Protestant Reformation, and a bias towards Anglicanism. Shortly afterwards de La Roche began to edit the M√©moires Litt√©raires, which was published at The Hague at intervals till 1724. In 1725 he started New Memoirs of Literature, which ran till December 1727, and finally, in 1730, A Literary Journal, or a continuation of the Memoirs of Literature, which came to an end in 1731.

It stands on a remote hillside adjacent to Upton Cressett Hall, some 5 km west of the town of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England (). It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The church originates from the 12th century. A north aisle was added in the 13th century, but this has since been demolished. A chapel was built on the south side of the chancel, probably in the 14th century. In the late medieval era a south porch was added. The church was declared redundant on 2 October 1970, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 March 1972. Architecture Interior in 1832, by Henry Harris Lines St Michael's is a small and simple church containing Norman architecture. The body of the church is constructed in stone with tiled roofs, and the south porch is timber framed. Its plan consists of a nave with a south porch, and a chancel with a south chapel. Towards the west end of the nave roof is a weatherboarded bellcote with a short spire covered in lead. The Norman architecture includes some of the windows, the south doorway, the arcade of the demolished north aisle, and the chancel arch. The south doorway has two orders of shafts, and two orders decorated with chevrons on its arch. The arcade is visible from the outside of the church and is in two bays. The chancel arch is described by the architectural historians John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"the most impressive Norman feature\\" in the church. It has three orders of shafts and three orders of chevron on the arch. The font is also Norman. The east window appears to have been reconstructed as a lancet window in the 13th century. On the west wall of the chapel is a painting dating from about 1200. It depicts an enthroned king, and is decorated with foliage scroll-work.

It stars Samuthirakani, Vaibhav, producer A. L. Alagappan and Abhinaya in lead roles alongside several newcomers. The film was known and referred to as Nagaram and Aaga Chiranthavan before the official title was confirmed. It released on 17 December 2010. Plot The story begins with a pub dance where girls and boys enjoy themselves to the fullest in a much spoilt way, which leads to verbal eve-teasing and results in a girl's death. Sangayya IPS (Samuthirakani), the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) of the area, is forced to revoke the case because of Chezhian's (Vaibhav) influence. Chezhian, with his rich and corrupt father MLA Deivanayagam (A. L. Alagappan), the State Minister for Forests and Agriculture, would bail them out even if Chezhian and his friends commit multiple murders. Chezhian falls in love with a girl named Reshma (Aparna), the daughter of a Karnataka-based businessman (largely inspired from Vijay Mallya). There are some political dramas that happen before the families agree to their marriage. Sangayya has been used in this political drama. He gets furious after learning this, but his hands are tied by the police commissioner. When Chezhian is mysteriously kidnapped and beaten up by an unknown character, Sangayya starts an unofficial investigation upon the commissioner's request. Sangayya solves the case and comes to know that an 11th grade student named Easan (Dushyanth Jayaprakash) is responsible. Easan has a flashback sequence. His father was a government employee in their native village, where he and his mute sister Poorani (Abhinaya) did their schooling. Once Poorani finished school, they moved to Chennai so that she can pursue fashion technology. Poorani's classmates are all too rich and spoiled. She is taken by one of her classmates to a party, where she is raped by Chezhian and his friend Vinod (Niranjan Jayaprakash) multiple times. Easan's family, not being able to cope with the incident, commits suicide by drinking poisoned coffee, but Easan survived because he only drank a bit. Easan is rushed to the emergency, where Poorani's friend Shyamala (Thulasi) visits him and reveals what happened to his sister. Due to the strong affection that he has for his sister, he decides to take revenge over the convicts. Easan is a computer tech genius and uses this to change the online prescription of Vinoth, so that he is killed as a medical accident. He has also kidnapped and beaten the hell out of Chezhian. This is revealed to Sangayya by Easan himself, while Deivanayagam and his assistant (Namo Narayana) arrive at the scene of investigation and find Chezhian's dead body. Deivanayagam and his assistant attack Sangayya and attempt to kill Easan by setting him on fire. Sangayya saves Easan and himself from Deivanayagam and his assistant by shooting and killing them. Easan is finally admitted in a juvenile reformatory and is visited by Sangayya and his family. Cast * Samuthirakani as ACP Sangayya * Vaibhav as Chezhian Deivanayagam * A. L.

However, after 90% of the shoot had been completed, Vikram pulled out of the venture, citing that Sasikumar had overshot his budget and the director eventually bought and released the film. Soundtrack Easans soundtrack is composed by James Vasanthan, with whom Sasikumar had worked for Subramaniapuram as well. The audio launch event was held on 19 November 2010 at Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai, with noted and acclaimed directors from various Indian film industries - K.Balachander, Bala and Ameer Sultan from the Tamil film industry along with Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap, Malayalam director Ranjith, Telugu director Trivikram Srinivas and Kannada director Yograj Bhat - participating. Reception Times of India wrote \\"Though \\"Eesan\\" is not in the class of \\"Subramaniapuram\\", it is a very satisfying watch nonetheless\\". Rediff wrote \\"If the director had shored up the second half just as much he's worked on the first, Eesan would have been a brilliant effort all over. As it stands, it's worth a watch, but doesn't really match up to Subramaniapuram\\". Sify wrote \\"The basic plot of Easan is simple, predictable and even clich?d but it is that presentation and performances of all characters big and small that makes the film watchable\\". Behindwoods wrote \\"Through Easan, Sasikumar has attempted to convey the dangers of city life when not dealt with carefully and it could also ring in a warning to people who take things lightly.

He was one of the few California artists invited to exhibit in the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern Art in New York.  Biography = Early life  Francis John McComas was born in Fingal, a small town in a valley of the same name in north east Tasmania. He studied art at the Sydney Technical College and the Sydney Art School.  Personal life  He married wealthy Marie Louise Parrott on June 28, 1905.San Francisco Call, 25 June 1905, p. 20; 29 June 1905, p.1. But within three or four years he began avoiding spending time with his wife. In 1909, they made a few short visits to their home on the Monterey Peninsula, but Parrott spent most of that year in their home in Mill Valley, while her husband, who experienced repeated episodes of ill health, worked at his studio in San Francisco, preparing for a sketching trip to Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico in July. Between 1910 and 1915 McComas spent most of his time outside Monterey. His wife and her family requested a quiet divorce, which he refused or ignored, perhaps attempting to maintain his legal residence in the United States. To avoid living at the family home in Monterey, he briefly established in 1912 a separate residence in Carmel that he used to paint uninterrupted by his wife's demands. He carried on an affair with Gene Francis Baker, 13 years younger than he. In 1916, Marie Louise McComas finally had enough of her husband's open infidelities on the Peninsula. The public divorce was a scandal for her and her family. She was granted the divorce by a Salinas judge on the grounds of ‚Äúabandonment and mental cruelty.\\" Excerpts of the messy divorce were published nationwide. The testimony and evidence revealed McComas' repeated meanness towards his wife: On n October 30, 1917, he married Gene Francis Baker. They lived on the Monterey Peninsula in Pebble Beach. They traveled extensively and McComas neglected his painting for several years. In 1936 McComas had a heart attack while visiting China. He died on December 27, 1938 in his Pebble Beach home.  Professional career  After visits to Hawaii and the Monterey, California Peninsula he exhibited 39 watercolors in February 1899 at the W. K. Vickery, Atkins & Torrey Gallery in San Francisco.San Francisco Call, 12 February 1899, p. 22. This was the start of a brilliant career. He briefly settled in Alameda before embarking that fall on a trip across the United States, including an exhibition in Chicago, and eventually to France, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian.Alameda Daily Argus, 6 December 1899, p. 1.San Francisco Chronicle: 17 September 1899, p.24; 5 August 1900, p. 12. He returned in December 1901 to the Monterey Peninsula, where he established a studio, but spent much of his time in the San Francisco Bay Area exhibiting and fraternizing with the local artists. While living in Monterey, he visited geologically unique Point Lobos nearby, which he famously described as the \\"greatest meeting of land and water in the world.\\" In addition to his regular venues in northern California, which included Vickery's, the San Francisco Bohemian Club and Monterey's Hotel Del Monte, he exhibited in Los Angeles, Boston and New York City, and contributed to shows at the Berkeley, California art colony in 1906 and 1909. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). He returned to Europe on a grand tour in 1907‚Äì08, which included a meeting with the king of Greece, and exhibited his California scenes at London's Obach Gallery and Carfax Gallery to positive reviews in the London Times.San Francisco Call: 19 February 1907, p.8; 28 October 1907, p.7; 18 November 1907, p.7.The Oakland Tribune, 3 April 1908, p.1. In 1913 he exhibited watercolors in the famous Armory Show in New York City. In 1915 he served on the hanging committee and jury of awards at San Francisco's Panama-Pacific International Exposition, where he displayed 10 watercolors in the Arthur Mathews gallery. His extremely problematic marriage ended in divorce in 1916, with the scandalous details published in the national press.Los Angeles Times, 6 October 1916, p. I.4.The Washington (D.C.) Post, 22 October 1916, p.11. The following year witnessed important changes in his career. He began to deemphasize watercolors in favor of mural commissions in oil for the homes of wealthy Californians. On October 30, 1917 he married the young artist Gene (Eugenia) Francis Baker; the couple initially lived in Monterey before building their dream home in the neighboring and rather exclusive enclave of Pebble Beach.San Francisco Examiner, 31 October 1917, p. 11. Between 1918 and 1921 he won awards at the Philadelphia Water Color Club, American Water Color Society (New York), and Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1923 he was hired by Cecil B. DeMille to design the sets for the Biblical epic, The Ten Commandments.Los Angeles Times, 26 May 1923, p. I.6. Criticism of his Cubist-inspired submissions to a San Francisco exhibition may have led to his departure from the Bay Area art scene. By the mid-1920s McComas almost abandoned painting to consort with the idle wealthy of the Monterey Peninsula. In the early-to-mid 1930s he reemerged as a serious artist with several exhibitions of new works, some of which were inspired by recent trips to Mexico and his meetings with Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco.San Francisco Chronicle, 21 November 1935, p.17; 24 November 1935, p.5-D. His two enormous \\"charcoal murals with a background of Capagold\\" for a department store in San Francisco received national praise.The San Francisco News, 14 November 1936, p.16. On July 28, 1988, The Carmel Art Association held an exhibition of paintings and graphics by six early Carmel Art Association members. McComas was one of them.

Room Thirteen said the EP \\"Sounds like Morrissey and Elvis Costello jamming at Elliott Smith's wake\\". Both these releases were produced by Ian Button. Templeton-Ward's work with Paul Hawkins saw him contribute towards six singles and two albums. Templeton-Ward's poetry has been performed in support of members from bands such as Ian Dury and the Noisettes. Templeton-Ward has appeared on radio numerous times including a BBC Radio 1 live session with Huw Stephens and multiple appearances on BBC Radio 6. Templeton-Ward began a new band, Black Coral Groove, in 2013. The songs are co-written with Ruari Meehan, the pair met on a European tour supporting Kasabian. All their music has been produced by Ian Button and the band, they are expected to begin a live tour in 2015.

Templeton-Ward has interviewed many musical artists including Sunn O))), Beirut, E.M.A., Nosaj Thing, James P Honey, CREEP, Yoni Wolf, Band of Skulls and CSS.  Fine art  As a practising fine artist Templeton-Ward's work involves multi-media, and the appliance of computer software to create imaginative landscapes. The artist's painting focusses on the relationship between alchemy, M-Theory and Jungian archetypes. His work has featured as part of the Seventeen collections. Templeton-Ward is set to release debut graphic novel 'The Infinite Cat' in 2020. It comes in conjunction with a series of artworks of the same name, both take their title from the novel's protagonist. The plot follows a talented scientist who freezes his head in the hope of future resurrection. Dr Badge ‚Äì as he is named ‚Äì eventually recovers consciousness in the 88th giga-year. Greeting him upon re-animation is an unexpected character ‚Äì a 600-foot tall, pipe-smoking cat ‚Äì the Singularity or Infinite Cat. After a brief introduction, the creature dramatically plots its life history beginning with prehistoric metallurgists and the dawn of shamanism/magic. It passes through the lives of alchemical luminaries such as Hermes Trismegistus, Moses and Jambres, various psychopomps, John Dee, Giordano Bruno and others, before addressing Jungian ideas of the archetype and the Swiss correspondence with mystical physicist Wolfgang Pauli. The central theme to Templeton-Ward's work is the homogeneity between what the artist believes are the realities of the collective unconscious and the unresolved problem of how (or if) wave function collapse occurs. The paintings allow parallel ideas and innumerable characters to get involved in the plot, expanding new spectrums to the allegory. These extra characters include Charles Bonnet's father, Will-o'-the-wisp, perceptual parapsychologist and ESP fanatic Karl Zener, Nicole Aubrey, Holinshed's witch and others, each revealing separate incidences and new avenues for thought. The characters appear in mock battles reminiscent of arcade games such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, tipping a hat to the world of Haraway's cyborgs, machine fetish/mythology and the tension between the zeitgeist and these emerging realities.

Biography=Shipping Robert Miles Sloman was the son of William Sloman, an English ship's captain who in 1785 settled in Hamburg with his wife and two sons William Palgrave Sloman and Robert Miles Sloman. William Sloman became a Hamburg citizen in 1791 and established his first company in 1798 as a ship broker. On his death in 1800 Robert Miles Sloman, then 17 years old inherited the ship broker business and a few sailing ships. After the Treaty of Amiens (25 March 1802) Robert Miles went to Antwerp to found a shipbroking- company but as war broke out again he had to return to Hamburg. Napoleon I then blocked the harbour of Hamburg as part of the Continental System so Sloman moved his business to T√∂nning at the mouth of the river Eider, then a part of Denmark. In 1806 he married Gundalena Brarens, the daughter of pilot inspector and nautical examiner Hinrich Brarens from T√∂nning. Postage stamp depicting the Helena Sloman Denmark eventually joined the Continental System but the company survived. In 1814 Sloman reopened his shipping business, at first in Cuxhaven English Consul. When French troops gave up Hamburg, Sloman returned but his last ship sailing under English colours was confiscated by the French and it was not insured properly. Under Hamburg laws as a broker Sloman was forbidden to act as a ship owner so his captains, who part-owned the ships founded ghost-shipping-companies. The shipping company Rob. M. Sloman & CO. oHG took passengers to and from England but on 17 February 1836 the shipping company opened the first regular transatlantic service from Hamburg to New York with the bark Franklin and two other sailing packets. On 8 May 1841 Sloman and eight other shipowners formed Hanseati Dampfschiffahrts- Compagnie and built in England two paddle steamers, the Hamburg and the Manchester which sailed to and from Kingston upon Hull and by 1846 the transatlantic fleet had grown to seven. The Sloman Line had a competitor in the Hamburg- Amerikanische Packetfahrt Aktien-Gesellschaft which was formed in May 1847. When their first sailing packet, Deutschland, left Hamburg on her maiden voyage in October 1848, Sloman responded in 1850 by changing from sail to steam with the British-built,iron-hulled screw steamship, Helena Sloman. This ship was lost on only her third transatlantic voyage. Another iron screw ship was ordered by Sloman in 1853, but then Hamburg- America decided to switch from sail to steam. Sloman immediately offered to run a joint service with his rival‚Äôs steamships, but they rejected his proposal. Hamburg-America‚Äôs transatlantic steamship service began on 1 June 1856, when the Borussia set off for New York with sister-ship Hammonia following a month later. Sloman gave up on steamships and remained a sailing packet line. In 1898 R Slowman Company bought the 3739 ton steamer Moravia from the American Hamburg Line and renamed it the Parma. Other activities Robert Sloman with business associates Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy, Johann Christian Jauch, Ernst Merck and Johann Heinrich Schr√∂der organised the Internationale Landwirtschaftsaustellung (International Agricultural Exhibition) at Heiligengeistfeld in 1863 and was a member of its guarantee fund. In 1865 he was a joint founder of the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service. Sloman was a member of the Hamburg Parliament from 1859 to 1861.

It is now cultivated as an ornamental garden tree throughout South Africa. Human usage Cape saffron as a garden subject A wild specimen with its distinctive saffron-coloured trunk Cape saffron has been used locally for centuries for its beautiful, hard wood, which assumes a yellowish-orange colour and was traditionally valued for furniture. Its more common use now is as an attractive ornamental feature in gardens. It grows slowly, but is very tough and resistant to wind. In exposed positions, in direct sun or wind, it will tend to grow shorter, lower and denser. It forms an attractive, domed shape, with a saffron-coloured trunk and often multi- coloured foliage.

Appearance  indigenous forest on Table Mountain. The hard-pear is a large tree that usually grows to 15‚Äì20 meters in height. When exposed to harsh conditions, it forms a smaller tree or shrub. The bark is originally smooth and grey, but it becomes rough, flaky, fissured and reddish as the tree matures. The leathery, dark green, glossy leaves appear in opposite pairs, while the pinkish-white, fragrant, bisexual flowers appear in bunches at branch ends in the spring. The tree very occasionally bears pinkish-red berries. The hard-pear can sometimes be identified by the strong smell of almonds given off by the crushing of its leaves. Distribution Olinia ventosa is a native of the southern and eastern coastal regions of South Africa, from the Cape Peninsula to southern KwaZulu-Natal. Its natural habitat is afro-montane forests, especially the forest margins, as well as coastal scrub and rocky hillsides. It is now increasingly cultivated throughout South Africa, as a hardy and attractive shade tree for large gardens. Uses and cultivation It is very fast-growing, hardy and able to tolerate poor and stony soils. As with most trees, it should not be planted too close to buildings or paved areas. Seeds are readily produced in the fruits, but are difficult to germinate, having a very tough coating that first needs to be removed. Once germinated, the young plants grow very rapidly. While its wood has historically been valued for furniture-making, its primary use now is as a large shade tree for South African gardens.

It was last assigned to Western Transport Air Force of Military Air Transport Service at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. It was inactivated on 22 June 1964 and its remaining squadron transferred to the 1503d Air Transport Group. History The wing was first organized in at Haneda Air Base in June 1948 as the 540th Air Transport Wing by Military Air Transport Service (MATS). Along with its subordinate units, it replaced the 22d Air Transport Group (Provisional) and absorbed the personnel and equipment of the 1539th Air Force Base Unit of Air Transport Command, which had been stationed at Haneda since the summer of 1946. The wing was soon renamed the 1503d Air Transport Wing to comply with United States Air Force requirements that MATS units be numbered between 1200 and 2199. The 1503d became the main MATS organization in the Western Pacific, supporting numerous tenant organizations such as the Air Rescue Service; Air Weather Service, and Far East Air Force theater Troop Carrier Groups (later Wings) which transshipped supplies and personnel from the MATS Aerial Port at Tachikawa throughout the 1950s. The first major mission by the 1503d was the evacuation of large numbers of Americans out of China in 1948 after the Communists defeated the Chinese Nationalist forces during the Chinese Civil War. The Korean War saw operations increase, with Troop Carrier units carrying out the evacuation of American civilians and then transporting the torrent of Allied military men and material flowing into the war zone. Around the clock planes arrived and departed. A typical flight might carry 35,000 pounds of hand grenades to South Korea, with 80 wounded personnel arriving to be transported to the USAF Hospital on the base. For thousands of servicemen whose tours took them into, through or out of Tachikawa, the USAF hospital became the best barometer of American military activities in the Far East. MATS C-118A Liftmaster 53-3265 MATS Navy R7V-B1 Bn 131654 MATS flights arriving on C-118, C-121, C-124, and later C-135 jet transports from Hickam Field, Hawaii or being staged through Alaska. From Tachikawa, outbound MATS flights headed to Clark Air Base heading to Saigon, Bangkok, and on to Karachi Airport, Pakistan or to Guam, Wake or Midway Island in the Central Pacific Region. As United States military forces began to increase in Indochina, more and more equipment moved into first Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam, then to Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base, near Bangkok, and in early 1965 to the huge new Cam Ranh Air Base with the jet C-141 Starlifter transports. In 1964, operations from Tachikawa began to phase down as its location in the urban area of Tokyo made heavy transport operations undesirable, with more and more heavy transport operations going to Yokota Air Base. The 1503d was discontinued and replaced by the 1503d Air Transport Group, and focused more on aeromedical transport operations from the Philippines, and supporting MATS units at deployed locations in the Pacific.

It is maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), based at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK. The database, originally known as StARlite, was developed by a biotechnology company called Inpharmatica Ltd. later acquired by Galapagos NV. The data was acquired for EMBL in 2008 with an award from The Wellcome Trust, resulting in the creation of the ChEMBL chemogenomics group at EMBL-EBI, led by John Overington.  Scope and access  The ChEMBL database contains compound bioactivity data against drug targets. Bioactivity is reported in Ki, Kd, IC50, and EC50. Data can be filtered and analyzed to develop compound screening libraries for lead identification during drug discovery. ChEMBL version 2 (ChEMBL_02) was launched in January 2010, including 2.4 million bioassay measurements covering 622,824 compounds, including 24,000 natural products. This was obtained from curating over 34,000 publications across twelve medicinal chemistry journals. ChEMBL's coverage of available bioactivity data has grown to become \\"the most comprehensive ever seen in a public database.\\". In October 2010 ChEMBL version 8 (ChEMBL_08) was launched, with over 2.97 million bioassay measurements covering 636,269 compounds. ChEMBL_10 saw the addition of the PubChem confirmatory assays, in order to integrate data that is comparable to the type and class of data contained within ChEMBL. ChEMBLdb can be accessed via a web interface or downloaded by File Transfer Protocol. It is formatted in a manner amenable to computerized data mining, and attempts to standardize activities between different publications, to enable comparative analysis. ChEMBL is also integrated into other large-scale chemistry resources, including PubChem and the ChemSpider system of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Associated resources In addition to the database, the ChEMBL group have developed tools and resources for data mining. These include Kinase SARfari, an integrated chemogenomics workbench focussed on kinases. The system incorporates and links sequence, structure, compounds and screening data. GPCR SARfari is a similar workbench focused on GPCRs, and ChEMBL-Neglected Tropical Diseases (ChEMBL- NTD) is a repository for Open Access primary screening and medicinal chemistry data directed at endemic tropical diseases of the developing regions of the Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The primary purpose of ChEMBL-NTD is to provide a freely accessible and permanent archive and distribution centre for deposited data. July 2012 saw the release of a new malaria data service, sponsored by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), aimed at researchers around the globe. The data in this service includes compounds from the Malaria Box screening set, as well as the other donated malaria data found in ChEMBL- NTD. myChEMBL, the ChEMBL virtual machine, was released in October 2013 to allow users to access a complete and free, easy-to-install cheminformatics infrastructure. In December 2013, the operations of the SureChem patent informatics database were transferred to EMBL-EBI. In a portmanteau, SureChem was renamed SureChEMBL. 2014 saw the introduction of the new resource ADME SARfari - a tool for predicting and comparing cross-species ADME targets.

It was written by S. N. Swamy and directed by G. S. Vijayan in his directorial debut. The story is loosely based on the 1958 film Chase a Crooked Shadow, the title of which is openly mentioned in one of the dialogues in the movie. Plot Philip Manavaalan (Mammootty) is the owner of a financing company in Kerala and the movie begins with his wedding preparations. After the wedding, Philip's wife, Cecily (Shobhana) is curious about Raju (Rahman), Philip's dead brother and so Philip relates the story of Raju to Cecily. Raju was young, vibrant and a man of many talents. However, he soon fell prey to the world of drugs and started extracting money to buy drugs from his brother by hook or by crook. Philip, upon learning of his brother's drug problem, admitted him into a rehab facility. Raju appeared to recover and was then sent to Madras (Tamil Nadu) for further studies. On one of his visits to Chennai, Philip realised that Raju had gone back to his old ways and was worse than ever before. One night, Raju stole some money and absconded with Philip's car. Philip came to know of this later when he received a call informing him that his car had met with an accident and the car's driver had perished in the explosion. Philip performed the last rites on his brother's body, which was burnt beyond recognition, in Madras itself and returned to Kerala. Cecily sympathises with her husband and soon gets over this sad incident. However one day, suddenly Raju returns home and surprises everyone. Mammootty has a hard time believing that this man is his brother. He performs many tests to prove whether the man is really his brother Raju. He is assisted by his friends in all these tests, but every test yields positive results. Soon almost everyone is convinced that it was indeed Raju who had come back. However, Mammootty is still doubtful. Meanwhile, Renu (Lizy) the daughter of Philip's friend Cherian (Janardhanan) a police officer, who had been bethrothed to Raju, convinced that Raju had come back, begins an affair with him. Philip sees this and informs Cherian about it. Cherian talks to his daughter trying to convince her what a mistake it would be if it is not Raju. But Renu is adamant and expresses her belief that Raju had returned and also tells that she will marry none but Raju. So, Janardhanan visits Mammootty along with their common friend Murali, who is a lawyer to propose Renu for Raju. But Mammootty refuses, saying that he doesn't believe it is his brother who had come back. Everyone gets frustrated that Philip still won't accept Raju in spite of the positive results of all the tests conducted before. At last, Cherian decides to perform a scientific test to prove the truth. He goes to Chennai where Raju's body had been cremated and excavates the remains. He takes a picture of the skull and a picture of Raju and superimposes the two. It doesn't match! Upon reaching his house, he calls Murali and Jagathy Sreekumar to inform them about this. They go to his house and wait for Mammootty to come. He comes soon after in the hope that Cherian has got evidence to prove that Raju was dead and it was an impostor who had come. But when he got there, he finds Cherian in a happy state. Cherian passes on the information to Philip and shows him the super-imposed picture that doesn't match. But still he is not convinced. When questioned why, he replies that Raju died lying in his hands. Cherian asks him to explain. Philip then reveals that Raju had not died in a car accident as he said to everyone. The day he died, Raju stole money from Philip's cupboard and tried to escape with it. Philip stopped him and asked him where he was going. Raju rudely said that he was leaving as he could no longer live with Philip. He took the money so that he could live the way he wanted to. Philip begged Raju not to go and ruin himself in bad company. Raju did not listen and tried to go, but Philip held him back. Raju pushed him away. In anger, Philip slapped Raju who lost his balance and fell from the first floor to the ground, breaking his neck and head in the fall. Philip rushed down to his brother and lifted him. But Raju died soon. Shocked at what he had done by mistake, Philip cries holding his brother's body. Suddenly he realised that he will be held guilty for Raju's death. Seeing no way to prove his innocence, he decides to dispose of Raju's body.

The particles would usually be of a similar size, often crushed and screened prior to being fed over the jig bed. There are many variations in design; however the basic principles are constant: The particles are introduced to the jig bed (usually a screen) where they are thrust upward by a pulsing water column or body, resulting in the particles being suspended within the water. As the pulse dissipates, the water level returns to its lower starting position and the particles once again settle on the jig bed. As the particles are exposed to gravitational energy whilst in suspension within the water, those with a higher specific gravity (density) settle faster than those with a lower count, resulting in a concentration of material with higher density at the bottom, on the jig bed. The particles are now concentrated according to density and can be extracted from the jig bed separately. In the mining of most heavy minerals, the denser material would be the desired mineral and the rest would be discarded as floats (or tailings). There are some minerals, notably coal, that are lighter (lower in density) than the surrounding rock and in such instances the process of extraction would work in reverse, i.e. the coal would settle on top with the rock below (on the jig bed).

Y. Kitaev, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference of Quantum Communication and Measurement, Ed. O. Hirota, A. S. Holevo, and C. M. Caves (New York, Plenum, 1997). It is the simplest and most well studied of the quantum double models. It is also the simplest example of topological order‚ÄîZ2 topological order (first studied in the context of Z2 spin liquid in 1991). The toric code can also be considered to be a Z2 lattice gauge theory in a particular limit. It was introduced by Alexei Kitaev. The toric code gets its name from its periodic boundary conditions, giving it the shape of a torus. These conditions give the model translational invariance, which is useful for analytic study. However, experimental realization requires open boundary conditions, allowing the system to be embedded on a 2D surface. The resulting code is typically known as the planar code. This has identical behaviour to the toric code in most, but not all, cases. Error correction and computation The toric code is defined on a two-dimensional lattice, usually chosen to be the square lattice, with a spin-¬Ω degree of freedom located on each edge. They are chosen to be periodic. Stabilizer operators are defined on the spins around each vertex v and plaquette (or face ie. a vertex of the dual lattice) p of the lattice as follows, A_v = \\\\prod_{i \\\\in v} \\\\sigma^x_i, \\\\,\\\\, B_p = \\\\prod_{i \\\\in p} \\\\sigma^z_i. Where here we use i \\\\in v to denote the edges touching the vertex v , and i \\\\in p to denote the edges surrounding the plaquette p . The stabilizer space of the code is that for which all stabilizers act trivially, hence, A_v  \\\\psi \\\\rangle =  \\\\psi \\\\rangle, \\\\,\\\\, \\\\forall v, \\\\,\\\\, B_p  \\\\psi \\\\rangle =  \\\\psi \\\\rangle, \\\\,\\\\, \\\\forall p, for any state  \\\\psi \\\\rangle . For the toric code, this space is four-dimensional, and so can be used to store two qubits of quantum information. This can be proven by considering the number of independent stabilizer operators. The occurrence of errors will move the state out of the stabilizer space, resulting in vertices and plaquettes for which the above condition does not hold. The positions of these violations is the syndrome of the code, which can be used for error correction. A section of the toric code. A vertex and plaquette are highlighted, along with the spins used in the definition of their stabilizers. The unique nature of the topological codes, such as the toric code, is that stabilizer violations can be interpreted as quasiparticles. Specifically, if the code is in a state  \\\\phi \\\\rangle such that, A_v  \\\\phi \\\\rangle = -  \\\\phi \\\\rangle , a quasiparticle known as an e anyon can be said to exist on the vertex v . Similarly violations of the B_p are associated with so called m anyons on the plaquettes. The stabilizer space therefore corresponds to the anyonic vacuum. Single spin errors cause pairs of anyons to be created and transported around the lattice. When errors create an anyon pair and move the anyons, one can imagine a path connecting the two composed of all links acted upon. If the anyons then meet and are annihilated, this path describes a loop. If the loop is topologically trivial, it has no effect on the stored information. The annihilation of the anyons, in this case, corrects all of the errors involved in their creation and transport. However, if the loop is topologically non-trivial, though re-annihilation of the anyons returns the state to the stabilizer space it also implements a logical operation on the stored information. The errors, in this case, are therefore not corrected but consolidated. The topologically nontrivial loops of the torus. Moving anyons along these implement logical Pauli operators on the stored qubits. Consider the noise model for which bit and phase errors occur independently on each spin, both with probability p. When p is low, this will create sparsely distributed pairs of anyons which have not moved far from their point of creation. Correction can be achieved by identifying the pairs that the anyons were created in (up to an equivalence class), and then re-annihilating them to remove the errors. As p increases, however, it becomes more ambiguous as to how the anyons may be paired without risking the formation of topologically non-trivial loops. This gives a threshold probability, under which the error correction will almost certainly succeed. Through a mapping to the random-bond Ising model, this critical probability has been found to be around 11%. Other error models may also be considered, and thresholds found. In all cases studied so far, the code has been found to saturate the Hashing bound. For some error models, such as biased errors where bit errors occur more often than phase errors or vice versa, lattices other than the square lattice must be used to achieve the optimal thresholds. These thresholds are upper limits and are useless unless efficient algorithms are found to achieve them. The most well-used algorithm is minimum weight perfect matching. When applied to the noise model with independent bit and flip errors, a threshold of around 10.5% is achieved. This falls only a little short of the 11% maximum. However, matching does not work so well when there are correlations between the bit and phase errors, such as with depolarizing noise. The means to perform quantum computation on logical information stored within the toric code has been considered, with the properties of the code providing fault-tolerance. It has been shown that extending the stabilizer space using 'holes', vertices or plaquettes on which stabilizers are not enforced, allows many qubits to be encoded into the code. However, a universal set of unitary gates cannot be fault-tolerantly implemented by unitary operations and so additional techniques are required to achieve quantum computing. For example, universal quantum computing can be achieved by preparing magic states via encoded quantum stubs called tidBits used to teleport in the required additional gates when replaced as a qubit. Furthermore, preparation of magic states must be fault tolerant, which can be achieved by magic state distillation on noisy magic states. A measurement based scheme for quantum computation based upon this principle has been found, whose error threshold is the highest known for a two-dimensional architecture. Hamiltonian and self-correction Since the stabilizer operators of the toric code are quasilocal, acting only on spins located near each other on a two-dimensional lattice, it is not unrealistic to define the following Hamiltonian, H_{TC} = - J\\\\sum_v A_v - J\\\\sum_p B_p, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, J>0. The ground state space of this Hamiltonian is the stabilizer space of the code. Excited states correspond to those of anyons, with the energy proportional to their number. Local errors are therefore energetically suppressed by the gap, which has been shown to be stable against local perturbations. However, the dynamic effects of such perturbations can still cause problems for the code. The gap also gives the code a certain resilience against thermal errors, allowing it to be correctable almost surely for a certain critical time. This time increases with J , but since arbitrary increases of this coupling are unrealistic, the protection given by the Hamiltonian still has its limits. The means to make the toric code, or the planar code, into a fully self-correcting quantum memory is often considered. Self-correction means that the Hamiltonian will naturally suppress errors indefinitely, leading to a lifetime that diverges in the thermodynamic limit. It has been found that this is possible in the toric code only if long range interactions are present between anyons. Proposals have been made for realization of these in the lab Another approach is the generalization of the model to higher dimensions, with self-correction possible in 4D with only quasi-local interactions. Anyon model As mentioned above, so called e and m quasiparticles are associated with the vertices and plaquettes of the model, respectively. These quasiparticles can be described as anyons, due to the non-trivial effect of their braiding. Specifically, though both species of anyons are bosonic with respect to themselves, the braiding of two e 's or m 's having no effect, a full monodromy of an e and an m will yield a phase of -1 . Such a result is not consistent with either bosonic or fermionic statistics, and hence is anyonic. The anyonic mutual statistics of the quasiparticles demonstrate the logical operations performed by topologically non-trivial loops. Consider the creation of a pair of e anyons followed by the transport of one around a topologically nontrivial loop, such as that shown on the torus in blue on the figure above, before the pair are reannhilated. The state is returned to the stabilizer space, but the loop implements a logical operation on one of the stored qubits. If m anyons are similarly moved through the red loop above a logical operation will also result. The phase of -1 resulting when braiding the anyons shows that these operations do not commute, but rather anticommute. They may therefore be interpreted as logical Z and X Pauli operators on one of the stored qubits. The corresponding logical Pauli's on the other qubit correspond to an m anyon following the blue loop and an e anyon following the red. No braiding occurs when e and m pass through parallel paths, the phase of -1 therefore does not arise and the corresponding logical operations commute. This is as should be expected since these form operations acting on different qubits. Due to the fact that both e and m anyons can be created in pairs, it is clear to see that both these quasiparticles are their own antiparticles. A composite particle composed of two e anyons is therefore equivalent to the vacuum, since the vacuum can yield such a pair and such a pair will annihilate to the vacuum. Accordingly, these composites have bosonic statistics, since their braiding is always completely trivial. A composite of two m anyons is similarly equivalent to the vacuum. The creation of such composites is known as the fusion of anyons, and the results can be written in terms of fusion rules. In this case, these take the form, e \\\\times e = 1, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, m \\\\times m = 1. Where 1 denotes the vacuum. A composite of an e and an m is not trivial. This therefore constitutes another quasiparticle in the model, sometimes denoted \\\\psi , with fusion rule, e \\\\times m = \\\\psi. From the braiding statistics of the anyons we see that, since any single exchange of two \\\\psi 's will involve a full monodromy of a constituent e and m , a phase of -1 will result. This implies fermionic self-statistics for the \\\\psi 's. Generalizations The use of a torus is not required to form an error correcting code. Other surfaces may also be used, with their topological properties determining the degeneracy of the stabilizer space. In general, quantum error correcting codes defined on two-dimensional spin lattices according to the principles above are known as surface codes. It is also possible to define similar codes using higher-dimensional spins. These are the quantum double models and string-net models, which allow a greater richness in the behaviour of anyons, and so may be used for more advanced quantum computation and error correction proposals. These not only include models with Abelian anyons, but also those with non-Abelian statistics. Experimental progress The most explicit demonstration of the properties of the toric code has been in state based approaches. Rather than attempting to realize the Hamiltonian, these simply prepare the code in the stabilizer space. Using this technique, experiments have been able to demonstrate the creation, transport and statistics of the anyons. C.-Y. Lu, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 030502 (2009). More recent experiments have also been able to demonstrate the error correction properties of the code. For realizations of the toric code and its generalizations with a Hamiltonian, much progress has been made using Josephson junctions. The theory of how the Hamiltonians may be implemented has been developed for a wide class of topological codes. An experiment has also been performed, realizing the toric code Hamiltonian for a small lattice, and demonstrating the quantum memory provided by its degenerate ground state. Other theoretical and experimental works towards realizations are based on cold atoms. A toolkit of methods that may be used to realize topological codes with optical lattices has been explored, as have experiments concerning minimal instances of topological order.. Such minimal instances of the toric code has been realized experimentally within isolated square plaquettes. Progress is also being made into simulations of the toric model with Rydberg atoms, in which the Hamiltonian and the effects of dissipative noise can be demonstrated.

Its members are a mix of civilian employees and military personnel. The head of the service holds the military rank Colonel or (naval) captain.  Role and responsibility  NORDSD's primary responsibility is protective security and operative security services within the Armed Forces, including responsibilities related to the Norwegian Armed Forces security intelligence. NORDSD shall, on behalf of the Chief of Defence, Norwegian Armed Forces (CHODNOR):CHODNOR Security Directive (text in Norwegian)CO NORDSD Directive (text in Norwegian) *Counteract security threats, and threats associated with espionage, sabotage and terrorist acts that may affect military activities and/or national security. *Conduct background checks, (the vetting process) to determine if security clearance can be given to military personnel who apply for access to classified information. *Act as the Designated Security Authority in Norway for the \\"request for visit\\" system, by controlling both visits of foreign nationals to the Norwegian Armed Forces or Norwegian defence industry, and issue Norwegian citizens with a certificate of security clearance when visiting other nations where valid security clearance is required. *Liaise with the Norwegian Police Security Service in cases that involve the Armed Forces. NORDSD does this by collecting and assessing information regarding security risks and weaknesses within the Norwegian Armed Forces, to analyze and recommend which counter-measures must be taken. NORDSD is the largest security clearance (vetting) authority in Norway and handles approximately 20,000 security clearance cases annually.  Rule of law and legal mandate  Within any democratic and transparent nation, the rule of law and Rechtsstaat principle of regulating executive powers is fundamental. The Norwegian Constitution, Article 99, forbids the use of military personnel and powers against the citizens unless warranted by act of parliament or insurrection. Article 110c forbids any executive action that is a violation of human rights. Only the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), the Norwegian Intelligence Service (ETJ) and the Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) are defined as \\"secret services\\" and given special executive authority by separate acts of parliament. Since no special executive authority is given, the rule of law principle strongly limits NORDSD to only operate within the Armed Forces. Therefore, all actions or counter-measures must have a legal basis in: # The general provisions of the Protective Security Act,Protective Security Act The Defence Secrets Act,Defence Secrets Act (text in Norwegian) The Military Criminal Justice Actthe Military Criminal Justice Act (text in Norwegian) and the Military Police powers act.Military Police Powers Act (text in Norwegian) # Common law / Chain of command authority within the Norwegian Armed Forces # International treaties/agreements concerning military security regulation through Norway's membership of NATO.  Oversight  As a result of lessons learned by the surveillance scandals after the end of the Cold War, several fail-safe mechanisms are in place to prevent future breaches of human rights and illegal surveillance. NORDSD is under the direct oversight of the legislative and executive branches in Norway. The legislative branch exercises its control through the Norwegian Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee, (EOS-committee), which is an independent watch-dog that has monitored NORDSD activities since 2003. The service was elevated to be one of the 'main inspection objects' (the Norwegian secret services are the others), in 2009. In all of the EOS committee's annual reports to the Stortinget (the Norwegian Parliament), all deviation from what the committee deems to be good standards has, with the rule of law or human rights, been exposed and correctly criticized. These reports are available to the public on the EOS- committee website. The executive branch exercises its control through different means: *By controlling measures pursuant to the Protective Security Act in the Armed Forces, also in matters of personnel security to ensure uniform interpretation of the Act. NORDSD is under the supervisory authority of the Norwegian National Security Authority. *Political control which is exercised through civilian control of the military through the Minister of Defence, and the principle of accountability in the Parliamentary system. *The chain of command which is exercised through the CHODNOR, his Chief-of-staff and the CHODNOR auditory unit, and is responsible to regularly brief the Minister of Defence on NORDSD activities. *The judicial branch exercises indirect control of NORDSD in these cases' legal actionsCriminal Procedure Act brought against persons by the service or if a corporate charge is brought against NORDSD or its personnel.  Insignia  The shoulder patch worn by NORDSD military personnel on no. 2 service uniforms NORDSD insignia is constructed in accordance with Norwegian and continental heraldic rules and tradition; it was approved by the Chief of Defence, Norwegian Armed Forces (CHODNOR) in 2003. The insignia symbolism is as follows: # The crown is, in Norway, the symbol of the sovereign and the executive powers of the state. # The basis livery colour is green. This stems from World War II when the exiled Norwegian Armed Forces in the United Kingdom adopted the British Army's patterns to indicate rank and service branch. Green was the service branch colour for the intelligence and security service (this is seen today in the UK's army Intelligence Corps beret and stable belt colour which is cypress green). # The silver key represents access to knowledge that is the sovereign property and must be protected. # The lion figure is based on the Coat of arms of Norway. It represents strength and determination to protect and guard the nation and its firm hold on the key, affirms the loyalty to protect the sovereign property. Since NORDSD is not a part of the Norwegian Army lifeguard division ((this role is filled by His Majesty the King's Guards (HMKG) and the Military Academy (KS) - Linderud)), the standard gold colour is used.

Few months later, in March 1964, he founded the Democratic Union for the New Republic. The party, which was inspired to Charles de Gaulle's party in France, included several post- fascists such as Enzo Dantini and Antonio Aliotti, from the National Vanguard, and future member of Christian Democracy Vittorio Sbardella. New Republic thus had a right-wing connotation. Its main goals were to transform Italy into a presidential republic and to introduce a plurality voting system. Connected to New Republic was the university movement Primula Goliardica, later absorbed by Lotta di Popolo. The party's journals were Folla (since 1964) and Nuova Repubblica (since 1966). In 1968 Pacciardi and his followers, whose electoral results had been dismal, returned into PRI.Pacciardi, il repubblicano accusato di golpismo References Category:Defunct political parties in Italy Category:Political parties established in 1964 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1974 Category:1964 establishments in Italy Category:1974 disestablishments in Italy Category:Conservative parties in Italy ","title":"Democratic Union for the New Republic"},{"id":"29260556","text":"Homeland is a 2000 album by South African singer Miriam Makeba.

For the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games, the diving, gymnastics, swimming, and water polo competitions were held indoors. These Games have since been nicknamed the \\"Austerity Games\\" for the tight control of costs at a time when the host nation was still under rationing, which resulted in a total expenditure of around ¬£750,000.Findling; Pelle (2004): p. 130 All of the venues were already in place and required only temporary modifications.

This was due to the Empire Stadium's ability to hold a greater number of events, reducing the need for additional venues to be found. A new approach road was required to connect the stadium to the nearby Wembley Park tube station, so it was agreed that Wembley Stadium Ltd. would cover the costs in return for a share of the proceeds for the events held there.Gold; Gold (2011): p. 34 Motorcycle and greyhound races usually held at the Empire Stadium were highly profitable events, which meant that a cinder running track was not laid down until two weeks before the opening ceremony.Findling; Pelle (2004): p. 128 Lacking an infield lighting system, cars were driven inside the stadium to illuminate it for the last two events of the decathlon.Wallechinsky; Loucky (2008): pp. 265-266 The cycling tandem event, which was held in the dark, was another example of the main venue's lighting issues.Wallechinsky; Loucky (2008): p. 521 After the Games it was used as the English national football stadium, hosting numerous concerts and sporting events, including the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and the British leg of Live Aid in 1985. It was closed in 2000, and demolished three years later to allow the construction of the new Wembley Stadium. Adjacent to the stadium was the Empire Pool, which hosted the Olympic aquatic events and was the first-ever indoor Olympic pool. The pool was longer than the Olympic standard of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length. Due to lack of space, the pool was covered over so that boxing events could take place. The blackout paint which covered all of the venue windows ‚Äì still remaining from the Second World War ‚Äì had to be removed before the Games. The Olympics were the last event to make use of this pool, before it was concreted over. Aldershot was chosen over Windsor Great Park to host most of the Equestrian events. The central sports ground at Aldershot Command was selected to host the equestrian events with the exception of the team jumping events, and a demonstration by the individual dressage gold medalist, which were both held at Empire Stadium on the last day of the games. It was also chosen to host several events in the modern pentathlon event; the venue had previously hosted the British Championship in 1947. Bisley and Henley had both been previously used as venues during the 1908 Games. Bisley hosted most of the shooting events while Henley hosted the rowing competition.

Soon after the wedding he dies suddenly in suspicious circumstances, and the autopsy reveals that the police have a murderer on their hands. Everything points to Victoria as the only person with means, opportunity and motive, and as she can provide no sensible explanation as to who else could have killed her husband, she is arrested and put on trial for murder. Victoria is found guilty and sentenced to hang. As she is being driven back to prison, the car is involved in a serious road accident. Victoria is critically injured and is rushed to hospital, where brilliant doctor Noel Penwood (Ritchard) fights desperately against the odds to save her life. He finds a shard of glass has pierced her heart, and has to perform extremely risky surgery to remove it. Once the operation is over and Victoria is off the danger list, Penwood learns that she faces execution. He is appalled by the horrendous irony that he has saved her life so heroically, only for it to soon be taken anyway through process of law. As Victoria recovers, he listens to her story, believes in her innocence and starts to fall in love with her. Against all ethics, he smuggles her out of the hospital and puts her in hiding. The now romantically-involved couple do some sleuthing of their own, and finally stumble on the identity of the real killer. The police are extremely grateful and apologetic, and Victoria is exonerated, leaving her free to pursue the romance with Penwood.

It is the county seat of Fayette County and is located between Cincinnati and Columbus. The population was 14,192 in 2010 at the 2010 census. The area was initially settled by Virginia veterans of the American Revolution, who received the land from the government as payment for their service in the war. Name Officially named Washington as far back as 1910, the \\"Court House\\" suffix was used to distinguish the city from other places in the state with \\"Washington\\" in their name (Ohio also has an Old Washington, New Washington, Washingtonville, and Port Washington). The suffix is attributed to settlers who had come from Virginia, where \\"Court House\\" was used with county seats (e.g. Appomattox Court House). \\"Washington C. H.\\" was added to maps and postal guides, and the de facto use of \\"Washington Court House\\" persisted over time. The name was made official when the city adopted a new charter in the early 2000s. \\"Washington Court House\\" is the longest city name in the state of Ohio. History Washington Court House's first settlers appear to have been Edward Smith Sr., and his family, who emigrated from Pennsylvania in 1810. Smith and his family constructed a crude house in the thick woodlands near Paint Creek, but their efforts to clear the land were interrupted by his departure for military service in the War of 1812.Allen, Frank M., ed. History of Fayette County, Ohio: Her People, Industries, and Institutions. Indianapolis: Bowen, 1914, 752. Comparatively soon after returning from his martial pursuits, Smith drowned while attempting to cross a flooded creek,Dills, R.S. History of Fayette County, Together With Historic Notes on the Northwest, and the State of Ohio. Dayton: Odell and Mayer, 1881, 459. but his widow and 10 children survived and prospered despite the absence of their patriarch. Smith's descendants remained prominent in Fayette County for more than a century after his arrival from Pennsylvania, although many had left Washington Court House for other parts of the county. A family residence still stands on U.S. Route 62 not far outside the city's eastern boundary. In 1833, Washington Court House (then known as Washington) contained a printing office, seven stores, two taverns, two groceries, a schoolhouse, a meeting house, and about 70 residential houses. Numerous locations in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Downtown, the courthouse square has been named a historic district, and a similar designation has been accorded the city cemetery. Nine individual buildings are separately listed on the register: Judy Chapel at the cemetery, the former Washington School, the Fayette County Courthouse, the former William Burnett House (no longer standingFayette County Comprehensive Use Strategy Plan , Fayette County, 2006, 13. Accessed 2013-05-23.), and the Barney Kelley, Jacob Light, Rawlings-Brownell, Robinson- Pavey, and Morris Sharp houses. Streets within the downtown part of the city around the courthouse building are arranged northeast‚Äìsouthwest and northwest‚Äìsoutheast, rather than east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth, so that each side of the courthouse receives some sunlight every day of the year. 1894 riot Ohio Historical Marker on the front lawn of the Fayette County Courthouse On October 16, 1894, a crowd gathered outside the Fayette County Courthouse with intent to lynch convicted rapist William \\"Jasper\\" Dolby, a black man who had raped a white woman. Ohio Governor William McKinley called out the militia to subdue the crowd. On October 17, the crowd rushed the courthouse doors and was warned to \\"disperse or be fired upon.\\" They ignored the warning and continued to batter the doors. Colonel Alonzo B. Coit ordered his troops to fire through the courthouse doors, killing five men. Colonel Coit was indicted for manslaughter, but was acquitted at trial. After the trial, Governor McKinley stated, \\"The law was upheld as it should have been ... but in this case at fearful cost ... Lynching cannot be tolerated in Ohio.\\" The courthouse doors were not repaired or replaced and the bullet holes from the 1894 riot are still present in the southeast doors.

After primary school the family moved to Vienna, where his father worked at the Greek embassy. In Vienna he was educated at the Theresianum and later studied at University of Vienna School of Law, graduating in 1994 with a paper on the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. Political career Dimitrios Droutsas as Greek Foreign Minister meeting with Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar in October 2010 Droutsas with Gombojavyn Zandanshatar in June 2011. In 1999, Droutsas went back to Greece to serve as the Special Advisor to Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, George Papandreou. Among the important issues, he advised on were political rapprochement with Turkey, Cyprus‚Äôs accession to the EU and the Cyprus problem. In March 2004, he was appointed the Director of the Diplomatic Cabinet of the President of Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) George A. Papandreou. From March 2008, he served as the spokesperson of Pasok and in May 2008, he was appointed its Secretary for Foreign Policy and International Relations. On September 7, 2010, Droutsas was appointed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece in a cabinet reshuffle. His first tour as a foreign minister was to the Middle East from October 17 to October 20 with stops in Jordan, Israel and Palestinian territories, Egypt and Lebanon. In the 17 June 2011 cabinet reshuffle, Droutsas was removed as Minister of Foreign Affairs to take over as Member of the European Parliament from Stavros Lambrinidis for the remaining period of the 7th Parliamentary Term (June 22, 2011 ‚Äì June 30, 2014). In turn, Stavros Lambrinidis became the new Minister of Foreign Affairs. The demotion of Droutsas came after revelations that he had misrepresented his background, both formal qualification and experience, with claims that he had completed his doctoral thesis at the University of Vienna and that he had worked as a professor or assistant professor, claims that were proved to be untrue. Droutsas' works on European Law, International and European Commercial Law, and Foreign and Defense Policy have been published extensively in Greece and abroad. He speaks German, English, French and Russian. He is married to Faye Karaviti, who is a journalist.

Family  Messalla was the son of Marcus Valerius Messalla Niger and Hortensia (sister of the consul of 69 BC). He had a sister, Valeria Messala, who was the fifth wife of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Messalla had two sons: Marcus Valerius Messalla (consul 32 BC) and Potitus Valerius Messalla (suffect consul 29 BC).  Career  Messalla Rufus probably served as Praetor in 62 BC.Cicero described him as a candidate for the praetorship in 63 BC (Broughton 1952, p. 173). His appointment as consul in 53 BC was delayed due to a scandal involving the consular elections, followed by public disorder between the followers of Publius Clodius Pulcher and Titus Annius Milo. It was only in July 53 BC that he entered the office. He and his colleague's attempts to hold elections for 52 BC were also disrupted.Broughton 1952, p. 227. Messalla Rufus was also elected augur at an early date, for he was a member of the collegia of augurs for 55 years.Lewis 1955 p. 39. Messalla Rufus was accused more than once of illegal practices in connection with the elections; on the first occasion he was acquitted, in spite of his obvious guilt, through the eloquence of his uncle Quintus Hortensius; on the second he was condemned. He took the side of Gaius Julius Caesar in the civil war. He was a legate under Caesar probably by 48 BC.Broughton 1952, p. 282 In 47 BC, Messalla Rufus had to deal with mutinous troops under his command at Messana.Broughton 1952, p. 291.

In recent times, sounds have been increasingly used as trademarks in the marketplace. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect sounds as trademarks through registration, as a sound was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,TRIPs is an international treaty which sets down minimum standards of protection and regulation for most forms of intellectual property in all member countries of the WTO. which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass \\"any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertaking\\" (article 15(1)). Despite the recognition which must be accorded to sound trademarks in most countries, the graphical representation of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue. Sound branding Sound branding (also known as audio branding, music branding, sonic branding, acoustic branding) is ‚Äúthe strategic use of sound ‚Ä¶ in positively differentiating a product or service, enhancing recall, creating preference, building trust, and even increasing sales.‚Äù Audio branding can tell you whether the brand is romantic and sensual, family-friendly and everyday, indulgent and luxurious, without ever hearing a word or seeing a picture. And it gives a brand an additional way to break through audiences‚Äô shortened attention spans. Sound logos The sound logo (or audio mnemonic) is one of the tools of sound branding, along with the jingle, brand music, and brand theme. A sound logo (or audio logo or sonic logo) is a short distinctive melody or other sequence of sound, mostly positioned at the beginning or ending of a commercial. It can be seen as the acoustic equivalent of a visual logo. Often a combination of both types of logo is used to enforce the recognition of a brand. An example is the T-Mobile logo and ringtone composed by Lance Massey, the Intel logo composed by Walter Werzowa, or the Michelin logo composed by Sixi√®me Son. The sound logo leads to learning effects on consumer's perception of a certain product. A melody is the most memorable sequence of sound, since, when a melody starts, the human brain automatically expects the ending. However, some brands realize the importance the sound their brand can make and attempt to capitalize on its own uniqueness. A good example is the motorcycle brand Harley-Davidson, which, in 1994, filed a sound trademark application for its distinctive V-twin engine sound. It realized that if it could capture its own sound, it could distinguish the brand at every point of customer interaction. Communicate magazine 'Sonic Branding' July 2010. Just like a visual logo, the most essential qualities of a sound logo are uniqueness, memorability, and relevancy to the brand promise. Some widely known examples include: * 20th Century Studios Fanfare (composed by Alfred Newman) * AT&T;'s sonic logo. (composed by Joel Beckerman and Man Made Music) * ABC's 3-note leitmotif * Audi \\"heartbeat\\" sound logo * BMW sound logos * Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 (allegro) used by American Public Media * Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment fanfare (composed by Stephen Dewey and Machine Head) * ITV News at Ten \\"The bongs\\" * Kroger grocery stores and its subsidiaries * NBC chimes * Duracell's 3-note \\"coppertop\\" logo * \\"Fourscore\\", the four note audio ident used by Channel 4 * HBO fanfare themes (composed by Ferdinand Jay Smith III) * \\"Intel inside\\" musical jingle\\" (composed by Walter Werzowa) *Lufthansa's Sonic Logo * Macintosh startup chime * Michelin sound logo (composed by Sixi√®me Son) * McDonald's Corporation's five-note \\"I'm lovin' it\\" jingle * Netflix sound logo * New Line Cinema fanfare (composed by Michael Kamen) * Nissan \\"Innovation that excites\\" sonic logo * Nokia tune * \\"O Canada\\" (first four notes) CTC advertising (as well as ads issued from the Government of Canada) and the CBC ID * PlayStation robot sound (\\"zong\\" at beginning and \\"play-sta-tion\\" at the end of commercial) * Peugeot \\"Motion and e-motion\\" * Renault \\"Passion for life\\" * Samsung ringtone * Samsung Galaxy \\"Over the Horizon\\" jingle * SNCF 4-note identity * Sony \\"ding\\" sound logo * Sony Pictures Home Entertainment fanfare (composed by Lee Sanders) * Deutsche Telekom/T-Mobile sound logo (composed by Lance Massey) * Taco Bell \\"bong\\" sound * Tarzan yell used by ERB Inc, since the first Weissmuller film * THX's Deep Note * Nintendo Switch click sound * Warner Bros.

Notable examples include the short variations of the BBC Radio 2 or Classic FM jingles. In recent years, television station idents have also introduced their own audio identities to strengthen their brand recognitions.Audio Identities at imagedissectors.com, URL accessed September 3, 2010 There are typically four to six steps involved in creating a sound logo: # The audio strategy development phase where the brand essence and other foundational elements is confirmed. # The audio touch point analysis phase where all places the brand will come in contact with customers and other stakeholders is identified. # The concept phase where an audio collage is created to help define texture, rhythm, melody, harmony, and instrumentation that best convey the brand values and then the unique sound or piece of music is composed to convey the distinctive brand essence and values. # The test and refine phase to where the combination of sound elements are optimized to ensure that they communicate essence, values, and promise of the brand. In this phase, psycho-acoustic research would be conducted, if needed. # The implementation stage to create the adaptations for each touch point. # The handover phase where an audio style guide is developed to help the supervisor or manager of the brand recommend, plan, and supervise the installation of the audio brand elements into devices, expo booths, displays, call centers, and other places where it will be used. Additionally, the licensing or ownership of the branding elements or all applicable usage rights, depending on the agreement, are formally transferred to brand. Once completed, the audio elements should be managed just like the rest of a company‚Äôs brand assets. Environmental sound design Creating a brand experience using sound is also within the area of sound branding. The opportunities for creating a sound branding experience that conveys a brand essence and soul is possible. Bentley Motors, for instance, recently looked to create a unique brand experience by replacing all interior mechanical sounds with sound that had been created for their Continental GT car. Roland Garros, home of the French Open created an audio identity that is used in its facilities and played during award ceremonies as well as opening and closing ceremonies. In a retail environments, sound branding extends to the use of sound in order to enhance the consumer experience and influence behavior . ‚ÄúFor instance, an academic study that took place in a Scotland supermarket found that sales of wines displayed side-by- side and priced similarly responded to music. On days when French music played, French wines outsold German wines. German wines, however, outsold French ones on days when typical German music was playing. British department store chain Selfridges is one of the notable brands to have enjoyed success with this approach, creating distinct consumer ‚Äòzones‚Äô within its stores, which change visually and sonically so customers know they have passed into a new department. These zones are often tailored to suit a particular product, customer profile, season or even times of the day and week. Article The Swedish Mall, Emporia, has also found success using soundscapes to help guide customers. Unibail Rodamco upscale malls have an audio identity that is adapted to their parking lots, entryways, walkways, even chairs and plant walls and extends into their advertising. Branding sound technology and devices Sound design for mobile phones, ATMs, laptop computers, PDAs, and countless other devices can improve the user experience by making tasks easier and more enjoyable. These sounds can also reveal something about the company that created the experience (and, in the case of personalized ringtones, something about the user themselves). Sound branding also encompasses the use of targeted audio messages by organizations to communicate with customers over the telephone, known as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging. These messages are typically deployed on an organizations interactive voice response (IVR) switchboard system or when customers are placed on hold and incorporate short, informative voice messages often accompanied by music. A study commissioned by audio branding specialist PHMG provided insight into consumer perceptions of on-hold marketing. It revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls and 68% of consumers are put on hold for longer than one minute. When on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence and 76% preferred to hear something other than muzak.ArticleArticle Other forms of sound in branding Sound branding encompasses many other tactics intended to convey organizational or product identity (who an organization is and what it stands for); enhance consumers' experience of a product or service; or extend an organization's relationship with its audience. Another form of sound branding involves an organization's public association with or sponsorship of a musical enterprise‚Äîa non-profit music organization, for instance, or perhaps a music artist or group of artists. For example, some companies completely unrelated to music offer free music downloads on their websites. Ostensibly intended to demonstrate the sponsoring organization's good will from a cultural patronage stand point, practices like these also brand the organization by calling public attention to its beliefs, its values, and its aesthetic sensibilities. It's arguable that sound branding is now using ‚Äòsubliminal‚Äô brand placement in pop song lyrics to echo a corporate slogan, a company‚Äôs ‚ÄòUnique Selling Point‚Äô or ‚Äòbrand values‚Äô (rather than the ‚Äòold fashioned‚Äô mentioning of brands / products directly). An example of this would be Pharrell Williams‚Äô 2005 song ‚ÄòCan I Have It Like That‚Äô (featuring Gwen Stefani), with the chorus which echoed the Burger King advertising slogan \\"Have It Your Way‚Äù. MP3 file of sound logo Audio marketing Audio marketing, also known as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging, is increasingly being seen as an important element of audio branding. It involves the creation of brand-congruent voice and music tracks, which are used by companies to communicate marketing messages to customers over the telephone. Typically, these messages are played while a customer is waiting on hold or while they are being transferred. They are also frequently used as part of interactive voice response systems designed to handle large volumes of calls. Different attributes of voice and music, including tempo, tone, pitch and volume, are all taken into account in order to create messaging that reinforce the values conveyed through a company's visual branding. Changes in consumer perceptions towards audio marketing have played a large part in its adoption. Negative perceptions were traditionally attached to on-hold marketing but a more recent survey conducted by CNN found that 70% of callers in the United States who are made to hold the line in silence will hang up within 60 seconds, while further research by PHMG found 73% of consumers want to hear something more than beeps or silence on hold. Registration of sound marks in different jurisdictions=AustraliaGraphic representation= In Australia, sound trademarks are generally acceptable if they can be represented by musical notation. According to the Australian trademarks Office, an application for a sound trademark which cannot be graphically represented with musical notation must include the following requirements. * a graphic representation of the mark (e.g. \\"CLIP CLOP MOO\\"); * a clear and concise description of the trademark (examples are given below); **The trademark is a sound mark. It comprises the sound of dogs barking to the traditional tune \\"Greensleeves\\" as rendered in the audio tape accompanying the application. **The trademark consists of the sound of two steps taken by a cow on pavement, followed by the sound of a cow mooing (clip, clop, MOO) as rendered in the recording accompanying the application. **The trademark consists of the sound of a soprano voice singing wordlessly to the tune represented in the musical score attached to the application. The trademark is demonstrated in the recording accompanying the application form. **The trademark consists of a repeated rapid tapping sound made by a wooden stick tapping on a metal garbage can lid which gradually becomes louder over approximately 10 seconds duration. The sound is demonstrated in the recordings accompanying the application. * a recording of the trademark which can be played back on media which is easily and commonly accessible. Other requirements are set out in the trademarks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure issued by IP Australia. European Union In the European Union, Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94 of 20 December 1993 (\\"signs of which a Community trademark may consist\\") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of \\"any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\\". In Shield Mark BV vs Joost Kist (case C-283/01) the EcJ basically repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.Shield mark B.V. v Joost Kist (case C-283/01) Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) This definition generally encompasses sound marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use musical notation to graphically represent their trademark. A piece of music‚Äîa tune, or a ring tone on a telephone‚Äîcan be easily registered as a trademark (provided, of course, that it meets the Community trademark tests for registrability and distinctiveness). While tunes are capable of registration, before 2005 noises were not. The sound of a dog barking or the crash of surf cannot be recorded in musical notation and sonagrams were not accepted by the OHIM trademark registry. A change in legislation occurred in 2005 so that now the Office accepts sonograms as a graphical representation of a trademark if they are accompanied by an MP3 sound file when filing a trademark electronically.The Manual Concerning Proceedings Before the Office fort Harmonization in the Internal Market ‚Äì Part B ‚Äì Examination United States In the United States, the test for whether a sound can serve as a trademark \\"depends on [the] aural perception of the listener which may be as fleeting as the sound itself unless, of course, the sound is so inherently different or distinctive that it attaches to the subliminal mind of the listener to be awakened when heard and to be associated with the source or event with which it struck\\". This was the fairly strict test applied by the US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in the case of General Electric Broadcasting Co., 199 USPQ 560, in relation to the timed toll of a ship's bell clock. More famously, Harley- Davidson attempted to register as a trademark the distinctive \\"chug\\" of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine. On February 1, 1994, the company filed its application with the following description: \\"The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use.\\" Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed oppositions against the application, arguing that cruiser- style motorcycles of various brands use the same crankpin V-twin engine which produces the same sound. After six years of litigation, with no end in sight, in early 2000, Harley-Davidson withdrew their application. Other companies have been more successful in registering their distinctive sounds: MGM and their lion's roar; the NBC chimes; famous basketball team the Harlem Globetrotters and their theme song \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\"; Intel and the three- second chord sequence used with the Pentium processor; THX and its \\"Deep Note\\"; Federal Signal Corporation and the sound of their \\"Q2B\\" fire truck siren; AT&T; and the spoken letters \\"AT&T;\\" accompanied by music; RKO with a combined moving image and sound mark depicting the RKO Pictures radio tower transmitting a Morse-code like signal; and 20th Century Fox with the very famous fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.

Its thickening agent is usually starch which makes the soup translucent and smooth. Many soups can be cooked in this way, such as expensive shark fin soup, Madame Song's fish soup (ÂÆãÂ´ÇÈ≠öÁæπ), and corn soup. History Geng dishes have been important in Chinese cuisine since early dynastic China, during or prior to the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC -1046 BC). In the past, the term \\"geng\\" was used to refer to any cooked soup or stew, with households serving it daily and for festive events. Fujian style beef geng In modern times, geng dishes consist of different ingredients commonly found in the night markets of Taiwan, and quite commonly in Fujian and Taiwanese cuisine. In Taiwan, the character for geng is sometimes written as \\"\\" and sometimes as \\"\\". The Lao (, ) and Thai language (, ) terms for curry, stew, or soup, are believed to have been derived from the Middle Chinese pronunciation of geng (). The Vietnamese term for soup, (e.g., canh chua), descends from the Sino-Vietnamese form of Áæπ. Cultural significance Due to its cultural prevalence, the food has been featured in various Chinese cultural sayings and idioms: *\\"Share a cup of geng\\" (ÂàÜ‰∏ÄÊùØÁæπ): To boldly partake in a pool of profit or spoils, regardless of the pleasantness or the morality of these profits' origin. The expression is typically attributed to Liu Bang's infamous rebuff against Xiang Yu during the Chu-Han contention. Xiang had previous routed Liu's army and captured his family as hostages, and publicly threatened to cook Liu's father alive if he refuses to surrender. Liu responded humiliatingly (and rather shamelessly) by pointing out that he and Xiang were once sworn brothers, and if Xiang was willing to commit patricide by killing \\"our father\\", then \\"share me a cup of geng when you are done cooking\\". *\\"Shop-closing geng\\" (ÈñâÈñÄÁæπ): To shoo-off clients or guests that a host does not wish to receive by a disingenuous action or excuse. *\\"Washing hands to make geng\\" (Ê¥óÊâã‰ΩúÁæπÊπØ): From a poem of Wang Jian, implying the trials of a new bride to appease and gain acceptance in her new family. The traditional Chinese spoon is called \\"di√†o gƒìng\\" (Ë™øÁæπ), which means \\"the implement that carries geng\\".

Launched in 2004, as Rick Mercer's Monday Report, or simply Monday Report, by comedian Rick Mercer, the weekly half-hour show combined news parody, sketch comedy, visits to interesting places across Canada, and satirical editorials, often involving Canadian politics. The show's format was similar in some respects to satirical news shows like Mercer's prior series, This Hour Has 22 Minutes. The first two seasons aired on Monday nights, and aired its remaining seasons Tuesday nights at 8:00 p.m. on CBC. The program was recorded in front of a live audience at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto, Ontario, except for the on-location and rant segments. These segments were shown to the studio audience during taping, with their reactions recorded for broadcast. In September 2017, Mercer announced that the show would conclude on April 10, 2018, after a total of 15 seasons. Segments *Monologue ‚Äî At the beginning of each show, Mercer delivers a brief monologue. In the earliest episodes this was similar to a late-night talk show monologue, with Mercer joking about Canadian politics. In more recent seasons, the opening monologue has been rarely more than an outline of the on-location segments to come, punctuated with a related joke or two. *On-location ‚Äî On each programme Mercer travels to one or more different parts of Canada, often to communities that are currently in the news or celebrating some event, and collects opinions, reactions, and quotes from people on the street. Often Mercer will participate in some demonstration related to the location (e.g. driving a TTC bus while visiting the agency's bus compound), with comic results. Two on-location segments (sometimes different locations in the same area, sometimes two distant locations; occasionally one may be a direct continuation of the other) appear in a typical episode. * Ad spoofs ‚Äî Mercer does a parody ad, often spoofing a real one. Usually appears at least once per episode, right before a commercial break. *The Front Page ‚Äî Mercer makes comical comments on certain photos of famous people in the world. Normally seen at the start of segment 2. *Rant ‚Äî Mercer does a 'streeter'-style tongue-in-cheek monologue about current issues, using the same format that he popularized on 22 Minutes with a long take and camera tilting; the main variation is that his old 22 Minutes rants were filmed in black and white, while his RMR rants are filmed in colour. These are almost always taped while Mercer walks up and down Rush Lane,Graffiti in Toronto#Legalization a graffiti-strewn Toronto alleyway. Usually used to begin segment 3. *Newsdesk ‚Äî Additional topical jokes, similar to the newsdesk segments on 22 Minutes, are sometimes seen in the latter part of the programme to pad time. * Conclusion ‚Äî During the brief final segment, Mercer invites the audience to visit his website with his blog, video clips and photo challenge. He then mentioned a local event happening in a (usually) small town somewhere in Canada. In early seasons, this is also where Mercer would give updates on the monthly contest. Recurring *Celebrity Tip ‚Äî A Canadian celebrity gives how-to advice to the audience, such as Geddy Lee showing viewers how to properly ride a toboggan, Shirley Douglas demonstrating how to boost a car's battery, Pierre Berton demonstrating how to roll a joint or Conrad Black demonstrating how to wax a maple leaf. The humour in this segment often comes from the juxtaposition between the celebrity and their ability to demonstrate something the viewing public might not have expected them to know how to do. Currently airs sporadically. * Monitor PieceAs indicated on titles of videos on the show's YouTube channel (accessed 2010-10-02) ‚Äî Occasionally Mercer will perform a \\"lecture\\"-type monologue in-studio, usually standing next to a TV screen and waving a metal pointer, attempting to explain a complicated issue or point out the absurdity of a particular policy. Typically the piece will end with an instrumental version of \\"O Canada\\" playing in the background. This is a continuation of a sketch style Mercer also used from time to time on 22 Minutes, most famously for the Stockwell Day/Doris Day petition sketch. Discontinued *Daryn Jones ‚Äî Correspondent Daryn Jones goes out and checks out cool things. This segment was discontinued in Season 3, with Jones leaving the show for MTV Canada. *Contest ‚Äî Early seasons featured a monthly contest in which viewers were encouraged to send in pictures. Mercer would show these pictures at the conclusion of the show throughout the month, and declare the winner on the final show of the month. Some examples include \\"Canada's Biggest Pothole\\" or \\"Canada's Best Shed.\\" The prize was usually a free trip to Toronto to attend a taping of the show. Production details Rick Mercer Report was produced by Island Edge Inc and the CBC. The show was produced in HD beginning in its third season. Reruns of the program air on The Comedy Network and CBC Television.

It has at least two tracks with continuous overhead electrification. The line was built by the Aachen-D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company and is one of the oldest lines in Germany, opened in 1853 and 1854. History  The Aachen-Neu√ü-D√ºsseldorf Railway Company (Aachen-Neu√ü- D√ºsseldorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft, AND) was founded to build a railway line from Aachen via Gladbach (now M√∂nchengladbach) and Neuss to D√ºsseldorf. This company depended on Prussian government guarantees and from 1850, it came under the management of the government-controlled Aachen-D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company (Aachen-D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn), along with the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company, which opened the Duisburg- Ruhrort‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach line in 1849 and 1851. Prior to the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussian military opposed the building of fixed bridges across the Rhine for military reasons, except in fortified cities such as Cologne, Mainz, Koblenz and D√ºsseldorf. The line was built from Gladbach to Obercassel (now Oberkassel) and completed on 16 December 1852. Passenger services opened a month later on 17 January 1853. After completion of the line to the Belgian border at Aachen on 16 October 1854, freight traffic ran on the entire line. At the same time, Rhine station (Rheinstation) in Obercassel was opened. In 1866, the Aachen-D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company was acquired by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME). In July 1870, the Hamm Railway Bridge was opened over the Rhine, connecting to the BME‚Äôs Rheinknie station in D√ºsseldorf and bypassing the Neuss Hauptbahnhof‚ÄìObercassel section. In 1882, the BME was nationalised and became part of Prussian state railways. In 1891, the new D√ºsseldorf Hauptbahnhof was opened and the line from M√∂nchengladbach was realigned to run to it. The line from Neuss to Oberkassel was closed in 1996. Current situation  Following the establishment of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 8, part of the line was upgraded. Between D√ºsseldorf Hbf and Neuss Hbf, there is a separate two-track S-Bahn line next to the two-track main line. Rail services The route is served (as of 2018) by Regional-Express trains on lines RE 4 (Wupper-Express) and RE 13 (Maas-Wupper-Express). It is also served by S-Bahn lines S 8 (on the whole line), S 11 and S 28 (both between D√ºsseldorf and Neuss). Planning  It is planned to establish a new station at Neuss Stadtwald between Neuss Hbf and B√ºttgen.

Oxford University Press published the book in March 2011. It examines what limits ‚Äî if any ‚Äî should be placed on a government's efforts to spy on its citizens in the name of national security.Oxford University Press UK Advance praise included a quote from former CIA Inspector-General Frederick Hitz: :\\"This book squarely faces the taboo subject of domestic privacy in an era of Islamist terrorism. Our enemies are not nation-states, so the targets of the intelligence services seeking to pre-empt terrorist attacks must be individuals. The casualty will be individual privacy. People will struggle against heightened surveillance, Chesterman notes, 'but the war will be lost.'\\"Oxford University Press USA Gareth Evans, president emeritus of Crisis Group and former Foreign Affairs Minister of Australia has written: :\\"This is an important book, breaking new ground in the sweep of its analysis, its analytical insights, and the policy implications it draws out. It shows just how often foreign and domestic intelligence gathering in the major democracies has been insensitive to public accountability, legality, and its consequences for individuals, to the detriment of both liberty and security--and how this can and must change. Simon Chesterman writes, as always, with compelling clarity and authority.\\" Oxford University Press USA Writing in the New York Review of Books, David D. Cole observed that Chesterman :\\"argues convincingly that the specter of catastrophic terrorist attacks creates extraordinary pressure for intrusive monitoring; that technological advances have made the collection and analysis of vast amounts of previously private information entirely feasible; and that in a culture transformed by social media, in which citizens are increasingly willing to broadcast their innermost thoughts and acts, privacy may already be as outmoded as chivalry.\\"New York Review of Books, 22 Dec. 2011 References Further reading  * Review in Times Higher Education by Gary T.

The band's lineup consists of lyricist and drummer Jake Huffman, bass guitarist Jason Ott, guitarist Justin Berger and keyboardist Atticus Kelly. Inspired by an eclectic mix of influences like The Meters, The Band and The Flaming Lips, McLovins combine their songwriting skills with extended improvisations and instrumental ingenuity. Taking a page from their jam band forefathers, McLovins always try to keep their audiences guessing at what's to come. Their eclectic setlists and individual musical personas define the band's live shows. Hailing from Hartford, Connecticut, McLovins have appeared at Gathering of The Vibes, Mountain Jam, The Peach Festival and the legendary Nateva Music Festival, as well as many acclaimed venues across the country. They have also performed with some of the most influential artists on the scene, including Buddy Guy, George Porter, Jr. and Oteil Burbridge. Personnel *Jake Huffman - Vocals, Percussion *Jason Ott - Bass Guitar, Vocals *Justin Berger - Guitar, Vocals *Atticus Kelly - Keyboards, Vocals History The band was founded in the summer of 2008 after a series of chance meetings between the trio at local music camps. The band toured locally in Southern New England playing a mixture of covers and their own original compositions, though it was a video cover of Phish's \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" that gained them attention on YouTube. In the spring of 2009 they released their first studio album Conundrum, which featured original songs inspired by the Norton Juster novel The Phantom Tollbooth. Conundrum featured graphics by Ink Design Studios, which is also responsible for the band's psychedelic skull logo. The band was featured in Rolling Stone magazine. In the summer of 2009 the band performed on the Green Vibes tent at the Gathering of the Vibes where they played to a crowd of over 1,000 people. McLovins commissioned a pair of posters from poster artist AJ Masthay to commemorate McLovins Phish Pre-Shows in Hartford and Satatoga Springs as part of the celebration for Phish's 2009 reunion tour. During the fall of 2009 and Winter of 2010 they continued to tour regionally throughout New England, including their first appearance at Moe.'s spring festival Snoe.down as well as playing Nectar's in Burlington, Vermont. They have managed to cultivate a loyal following due to multiple appearances at Keene State College. McLovins have done several shows at Troy, New York's Revolution Hall including a double bill with 7 Walkers on the venue's closing night. In the spring of 2010 the band released their second studio album, Good Catch, featuring original songs written by the band. In the summer of 2010 the band scheduled numerous festival appearances including StrangeCreek, Mountain Jam, the inaugural Nateva Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Bella Terra Festival and WormTown. The band continued to play locally and regionally with favorite venues including Black Eyed Sally's, The Main Pub and they have made several appearances at Brooklyn Bowl as well as Sullivan Hall in NYC. In the fall of 2010, McLovins collaborated with Phish lyricist Tom Marshall and his partner Anthony Krizan (of Spin Doctors fame) to co-write \\"Cohesive\\", which they recorded with Marshall and Krizan at Krizan's Sonic Boom studios. They debuted the song during a performance at Brooklyn Bowl where they were joined onstage by both Marshall and Krizan. The band also released a commemorative poster of this show, produced by AJ Masthay. They set an aggressive touring schedule for 2011 with return trips to Nectars, Fairfield Theatre Company, Infinity Hall and the band's first trip to The IronHorse Music Hall in Northampton, Massachusetts. Moving into spring of 2011, the band continued to tour and scored opening slots for Buddy Guy and Bill Kreutzmann's 7 Walkers among others. They also began work on their third album utilizing Marshall and Krizan to co-produce with the band. Marshall also contributed two songs to the disc along with their previous collaboration, the single \\"Cohesive\\", with all songs recorded at Krizan's Sonic Boom studios. The summer tour included stops at Strangecreek, Camp Creek and their first ever Main Stage performance kicking off Saturday's Gathering of the Vibes festivities. In the fall, the band's academic pressures began to limit their touring schedule until just after Thanksgiving when founding guitarist Jeff Howard decided he was leaving the group. Jeff finished the year out with four shows in December, his last concert with the band was December 30, 2011 at Pearl Street in Northampton. The debut show featuring new guitarists Justin Berger and Atticus Kelly was New Year's Eve 2011 at Arch Street Tavern in Hartford, Connecticut.

She is a Canadian citizen, currently Vice-President Academic & Provost at Concordia University of Edmonton. Henitiuk has been a visiting scholar at both Harvard and Columbia Universities in the US and at Kokugakuin University in Japan. She was previously Executive Director of the Centre for the Advancement of Faculty Excellence and Professor of English at Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton, Alberta, on the faculty of the University of East Anglia (UK) and Director of the British Centre for Literary Translation (BCLT).  Early years  Henitiuk was born in Manning, Alberta in 1963, and grew up in various locations in western and northern Canada. An interest in acting led her to participate in a number of drama workshops while in her teens. Following extensive travels in USA and Central America she completed a BA (French + Latin, 1985) and MA (French Translation, 1988), was then employed by the Alberta Government Translation Bureau, and operated a freelance translation business. Ms. Henitiuk subsequently returned to the University of Alberta, obtaining an MA in Japanese Literature in 2000 and a PhD in Comparative Literature in 2005.  Educational background  Henitiuk has a PhD (Comparative Literature) from the University of Alberta. She also holds a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes linguistiques fran√ßaises, Universit√© de la Sorbonne-Nouvelle. Her PhD was supported by Killam Prize and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) fellowships, the Dorothy J. Killam Memorial Graduate Prize, as well as an award allowing her to spend a year at Kokugakuin University in Japan conducting research (2002‚Äì03). Upon the completion of the PhD in 2005 Henitiuk was awarded the prestigious Governor General's Gold Medal as the foremost graduate at the University (all faculties). In September 2005, Henitiuk began a two-year post-doctoral fellowship at The Center (now Institute) for Comparative Literature and Society directed by Gayatri Spivak. Her sponsor was David Damrosch.

Her first major, and most frequently cited, article is \\"Translating Woman\\", an analysis of gender translation issues which she has continued to explore during her research. She has also discussed feminist aspects of literature in the context of magic realism. Recent scholarship has concentrated on examinations of the way translations of 10th-century Japanese women's writing has entered the western consciousness and the political/cultural dimensions of translation of such work. Henitiuk has authored a monograph on liminal imagery in a cross-cultural selection of women's writing and another book, designed to assist in the teaching of translation, looks at some fifty different translations from Japanese of a single passage from The Pillow Book. She has also co-edited two collections of stories by women from India, and a collection of critical essays on W. G. Sebald. Book chapters have analyzed boundary metaphors in Elizabeth Inchbald and rape as a motif in literature.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 18 December 1973, and was vested in the Trust on 23 July 1975. Only the chancel remains of St Cuthbert's Church, which would have been one of the last to be built before the Reformation, following the demolition of the nave in the 1860s. The neglected chancel was restored in the 1930s, when a new incumbent began to restore it, taking advice from A. R. Powys (secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings) who was also responsible for the restoration of St Andrew's Church at Winterborne Tomson. The parish of Oborne had been given to Sherborne Abbey by the Saxon King Edgar in the 10th century and it remained a chapel of ease to the abbey until the Dissolution in 1539. The interior includes mediaeval slip tiles and communion rails, pulpit and monuments from the 17th century. The pillar piscina and font were brought to St Cuthbert's from North Wootton. Above the lintels of windows on the east and north sides are inscriptions entreating prayers for the good standing of Abbot John Myer (1533) and Sacristan John Dunster of Sherborne. A new parish church, designed by William Slater, was built on a fresh site in the village and consecrated in 1862.

In 1762, France, anticipating that Great Britain would take Louisiana at the end of the French and Indian War, in the Treaty of Fontainebleau transferred to Spain all of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, as well as a newly-defined area east of the Mississippi which included New Orleans, called the Isle of Orleans. As the French had expected, in the Treaty of Paris (1763) the British took all of Louisiana east of the Mississippi, except for the Isle of Orleans, and incorporated it into their colony of West Florida, with the capital at Pensacola. Spanish possession of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, and of the Isle of Orleans, was also confirmed in the Treaty of Paris. The Isle of Orleans was bounded by the Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico, Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas as well as Bayou Manchac, previously known as Iberville River, and the Amite River. The Isle of Orleans was included in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. It formed the southern border of the short-lived Republic of West Florida, a few years later. References * Leroy E.

United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court established that the right to counsel can only be legally asserted by an \\"unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel.\\" Background A bloodstain on one of the pool cues in the recreation hall led Naval Investigative Service (NIS) agents to Robert L. Davis.Davis v. United States, . During questioning, Davis said, ‚ÄúMaybe I should talk to a lawyer.‚ÄùDavis, 512 U.S. at 455. When asked by the interviewers to clarify his ambiguous request, Davis responded that he did not want counsel. After his conviction of murder, Davis tried to appeal, claiming that his right to counsel was declined. However, his conviction was affirmed when his request for counsel was reviewed, deemed ambiguous, and it was concluded that the NIS indeed clarify his intentions before continuing with questioning. Opinion of the Court According to the court, the interrogators opted for the clarification method to determine if Davis's request for counsel was ambiguous or not. When Davis said ‚ÄúMaybe I should talk to a lawyer‚Äù, the interrogators replied by saying that they would not violate his rights. They made it clear that if he wanted a lawyer, they would have stopped the interrogation. When the interrogators asked for clarification, Davis answered that he was not asking for a lawyer.http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2582&context;=llr Therefore, the interrogators did not believe his request for counsel was ambiguous since Davis announced he was not requesting counsel in the first place. Nevertheless, Justice O‚ÄôConnor decided otherwise. She declared that the threshold of clarity approach was legally required for this case. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that an ambiguous and unclear request for counsel, such as David's ‚ÄúMaybe I should talk to a lawyer‚Äù, does not establish the right.Davis, 512 U.S. at 4561-62. The reasoning was that the defendant's rights under Edwards were not sufficiently requested with his utterance. The request for a lawyer must be clear and unambiguous. Justice O‚ÄôConnor understands that fear, intimidation, and lack of linguistic and interrogation knowledge may affect the way the defendant requests a lawyer. However, she held that the Miranda Rights should be enough for the defendants to understand their right for counsel which lead to the decision that Davis's request was ambiguous. Related Cases Davis‚Äô case is not independent in legislative history. Many cases have dealt with ambiguous requests for counsel. Among these include Smith v. Illinois. Smith was arrested, understood his Miranda rights, and when asked if he wanted a lawyer, Smith responded yes. However, his request for counsel was deemed ambiguous because he continued to answer questions during the investigation before a lawyer was present, thus terminating his request.. In the following case, State v. Demesme, defendant Warren Demesme's request for counsel was declined when he asked ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just give me a lawyer, dog.‚Äù Under review, his statement was deemed ambiguous. In another case, People v. Krueger, Michael Krueuger claims investigators continued to question him after his request to counsel, thus violating his Miranda rights. His request ‚ÄúMaybe I ought to have an attorney,‚Äù was deemed ambiguous.

The company's management predicts that the new approach will be able to produce wafers at half the cost of current methods. The company's name is a reference to the solar constant, representing the watts of solar energy that hits each square meter outside of earth's atmosphere. Technology The company used a $4 million grant obtained from the United States Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) program in December 2009 to fund research over an 18-month period. Grants from ARPA-E are designed to provide money to relatively small projects offering the potential for high-payoff results in fostering advanced techniques. 1366 Technologies was able to announce eight months into the grant period that it had achieved success in its casting technology, in which molten silicon is poured directly into a mold to produce wafers in their final form, a square on each side that is 200 micrometres thick and are then extracted from the mold using a proprietary technique to ensure that the wafer doesn't break while being removed.Wald, Matthew L. \\"A Cheaper Route to Solar Cells\\", The New York Times, October 19, 2010.

Before 1947, the Collar was also conferred upon extremely eminent Cabinet ministers, senior members of the Imperial family and certain senior military officers of the rank of Marshal. It may be posthumously awarded to extremely distinguished Prime Ministers of Japan; the last such award was to Yasuhiro Nakasone in 2019. **Grand Cordon ‚Äì Typically conferred upon royals of the Imperial House of Japan, foreign royalty who are not reigning monarchs, certain foreign non-royal Heads of State, and select Japanese Prime Ministers. Until 1947, the Grand Cordon was often conferred upon eminent military officers of the rank of Marshal. Often conferred posthumously. *Order of the Paulownia Flowers ‚Äì Established in 1888 as a Special Grand Cordon to the Order of the Rising Sun, but made a separate order in 2003. Ordinarily the highest regularly awarded honor, it is conferred in a single class (Grand Cordon); typically awarded to Japanese prime ministers, senior statesmen, select foreign heads of government, distinguished cabinet ministers and jurists.

Biography Fleischbein was born in Godramstein, Palatinate, nowadays Germany, in 1804. He studied painting in Paris with Anne-Louis Girodet. In 1833, he and his wife, Marie Louis Tetu, immigrated to cosmopolitan New Orleans, thus joining the community of international painters seeking fame in Louisiana.Brief biography @ Louisiana State Museum. Although born Franz Joseph, Fleischbein decided to change his name to Fran√ßois in order to fit with his Creole clients of Gallic descent. His paintings show a French academic style as well as a sweetness and charm common to 19th-century German painting. With the invention of the daguerreotype in 1839, Fleischbein also worked as an early photographer, an enterprise in which his wife took part.

He won three Group 1 races including Prix de la For√™t, Queen Anne Stakes and Lockinge Stakes. Paco Boy was known as a hold up horse, usually coming from behind with a devastating turn of foot. Background Paco Boy was bred by Joan Browne, and was sired by Desert Style, a Group 3 winning sprinter and son of outstanding sire Green Desert, out of the mare Tappen Zee. Paco Boy is a bay with a distinctive white stripe on his face. Paco Boy was sold as a yearling for 30,000 guineas and bought by the Calvera Partnership and put into training with Richard Hannon Sr.. He was described as \\"an old favourite\\" by his trainer due in part to his high-class ability in spite of his relatively cheap price. Career=Two-year-old season Paco Boy made his debut on 5 September 2007, finishing third in a six furlong maiden race on the all-weather at Kempton. He won his next race on the grass at Newbury, winning by two and a half lengths as the 2/1 favourite. He finished off his season with a win in a conditions race at Newmarket, beating the favourite Wid by three-quarters of a length. Three-year-old season Paco Boy made his season debut in the Listed Spring Cup over seven furlongs at Lingfield. Held up at the back of the field, he made rapid progress in the final fifty yards before winning impressively by nearly two lengths. He next ran in the Group 3 Greenham Stakes at Newbury, a recognised trial for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. Held up in his now customary style, he again won comfortably by three-quarters of a length, with the favourite Confront back in fifth. Paco Boy next entered the Group 2 Betfair Cup over seven furlongs at Glorious Goodwood. Ridden more forwardly, he led inside the final furlong and, despite edging left, held on to win by a neck from Stimulation. The Group 2 Hungerford Stakes over the same distance at Newbury was the next target, and Paco Boy registered an impressive victory by four and a half lengths as the 6/4 favourite. With this taking win, Paco Boy stepped up in class for the Group 1 Prix du Moulin over a mile at Longchamp. He faced an extremely strong field with dual 2000 Guineas winner Henrythenavigator, 1000 Guineas winner Natagora, 2007 French 1000 Guineas winner Darjina, and Prix Rothschild winner (and future Horse of the Year), Goldikova. Paco Boy finished third behind Goldikova and Darjina, but was disqualified after the banned substance salnuterol was found in his system. Paco Boy restored his reputation with an excellent win the Group 1 Prix de la For√™t over seven furlongs on the Arc undercard at Longchamp, where he beat Natagora by three lengths. Four- year-old season Paco Boy made his debut as an older horse in the Group 1 Dubai Duty Free over nine furlongs in Dubai in March. Held up at the rear of the field, he made little progress and finished eighth behind runaway winner Gladiatorus. Returning to Britain, Paco Boy ran in the Group 2 Sandown Mile in April, where he registered a three-quarters of a length win over Dream Eater. This race served as a prep for the Group 1 Lockinge Stakes at Newbury in May. Sent off the 11/8 favourite against a field that included Twice Over and Dream Eater, Paco Boy came with a strong challenge but faded in the final furlong to finish fourth behind Virtual. The Hannons felt that he had run below form, and it afterwards transpired that he was suffering from a broken navicular bone in the hoof that also affected him in the Sussex stakes group 1 where he finished second, beaten 2 1/2 lengths by Rip van winkle. In Paco Boy's next race he had another crack at winning a Group 1 over a mile in the Queen Anne Stakes, the opening race of Royal Ascot in June. Although his Dubai conqueror Gladiatorus was sent off favourite, Paco Boy won by a length and a half from Ascot specialist Cesare, despite running across the track in the final furlong. Hannon said afterwards, \\"I think it's put a few old jokers to bed. If he didn't stay a mile he stayed it better than the others anyway.\\" Due to his swift turn of foot, the Hannons decided to bring Paco Boy back in trip and run him in the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket. Sent off at 9/2, Paco Boy was held up and outpaced by the specialist sprinters before running on strongly to finish fourth behind Cartier Champion Sprinter, Fleeting Spirit. Back at a mile, Paco Boy's next target was the Group 1 Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, where he faced two outstanding horses from the Classic generation: 1000 Guineas and Coronation Stakes winner Ghanaati, and the Aidan O'Brien- trained Rip Van Winkle, who had recently finished second behind Sea the Stars in the Eclipse Stakes. Sent off the third favourite at 7/2, Paco Boy finished second to Rip Van Winkle, who triumphed by two and a half lengths. The Sussex Stakes was Paco Boy's final run in 2009 and he was rested for the following season. Five-year-old season Paco Boy did not run in Dubai in 2010, and instead reappeared in the Sandown Mile, which he won for the second time by over three lengths from Group 1 winner Pressing. He then attempted to make amends for the previous year and win the Lockinge Stakes, which he did in extremely impressive style; coming to challenge on the bridle before quickening to lead in the final furlong. After the Lockinge, he was made favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/5550825/Royal-Ascot-Paco- Boy-wins-Queen-Anne-Stakes.html The race at Ascot featured a highly anticipated clash between dual Breeders Cup Mile winner Goldikova and Rip Van Winkle, who had also won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Goldikova was sent off the favourite and duly prevailed by a neck from Paco Boy, who was gaining on the mare throughout the final furlong but could not get past before the line. He faced Goldikova again in the Group 1 Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville, but both older horses were beaten by the 2000 Guineas winner Makfi, who relished the soft ground to beat Goldikova by two and a half lengths, with Paco Boy a neck behind in third. Paco Boy attempted to get back to winning ways in the Group 1 Prix du Moulin, but was blocked half a furlong from home before running on again to finish fourth to upset winner Fuisse. Paco Boy clashed with Goldikova for a third time in the Prix de la For√™t, but again the mare was too good and recorded a record breaking eleventh Group 1 victory, with Paco Boy half of a length behind her in second. Paco Boy faced Goldikova for the fourth and final time in the Breeders Cup Mile at Churchill Downs in the United States, where the mare was attempting to win a record third Breeders Cup race. Held up near the back of the field as usual, Paco Boy ran on late down the straight to finish fourth behind Goldikova, who won comfortably. Paco Boy was sold to Highclere Stud and Waikato Stud after his fourth-placed finish in Kentucky, and his previous owners believed that he would not race again. However, his new owners decided to run him one last time in the Group 1 Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin where, despite being sent off the 2/1 favourite, he ran very poorly and finished last in a field of thirteen. His connections suggested that the long season and hard races had caught up with him and he was retired to stud. Assessment Trainer Richard Hannon described Paco Boy as \\"a horse with everything. He's got a cruising speed and then, when you get him into the race, he's got a turn of foot, which is what shows how good he is.\\" He earned a Timeform rating of 128, and an official rating of 124, making him the joint 14th best horse in the world in 2010. Retirement Paco Boy is standing at Highclere Stud for ¬£8,000, and Waikato Stud for $12,500. His first crop made their racecourse debuts in 2014. His second crop son Galileo Gold won the 2000 Guineas in 2016.

Herzog, a newspaper reporter living in Santa Ana, decided to change her career to law after reading a matchbook ad in the early 1950s. She signed up for mail-order law classes through the La Salle Extension University in Chicago. In 1957 she passed the bar, and in 1960 set up her own practice. The New York Times described the start of her landmark case: > One day in 1978, Janet Sullivan walked into Ms. Herzog's office and said > that she and her husband, Mark, who had just graduated from medical school, > were getting a divorce. Ms. Sullivan insisted that her work as an accountant > during the marriage meant that her husband's medical degree had been a > \\"joint investment in time and money....Ms. Sullivan sought a share of the > value of her husband's medical practice as part of the divorce settlement. \\" After the lower courts ruled against her, Herzog filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of California. In the meantime, \\"publicity surrounding the case prompted the Legislature to pass an amendment to California's marital property law in 1985. While it stated that advanced degrees do not constitute property ‚Äî and thus a divorced spouse was not entitled to a former spouse‚Äôs future earnings ‚Äî it did authorize courts to reimburse the supporting spouses for their expenses. Their share of the costs of tuition and books, for example, could be included in alimony settlements.\\" This law became known as the Sullivan Law. Sullivan and Herzog were disappointed in the ruling, contending that the cost of the education didn't approach the value of the medical license. Herzog noted that she felt \\"half a loaf was better than none, but I did feel it was half a loaf.\\" After Herzog's death, retired state appellate judge Sheila Prell Sonenshine noted: \\"The Sullivan case, and then the Sullivan Law, was one of the first in the country to expand property rights for spouses and to recognize their contributions to the accumulation of marital property.\\" References Category:1922 births Category:2010 deaths Category:California lawyers Category:La Salle Extension University alumni Category:American women lawyers Category:American women journalists ","title":"Patricia Herzog"},{"id":"29261544","text":"Koreanosaurus (meaning \\"Korean lizard\\") is a genus of neornithischian dinosaur.

In particular, the charity aims to increase awareness and testing; to provide services on a national and local level to people with, affected by, or at risk of contracting hepatitis C; and to campaign for greater public understanding of the impact of hepatitis C. It is the only national hepatitis C-specific charity in the UK and has offices in London and Edinburgh. History Formed in 2001 by Charles Gore, The Trust was the first charity in the UK to be set up in response to hepatitis C. He had contracted the virus himself and was moved to act as a result of the general lack of information and apathy he encountered during his own eventual diagnosis and treatment. Gore is also the founder of the World Hepatitis Alliance, organiser of World Hepatitis Day on 28 July each year. The Trust differs from other charities in the field in that its ethos is rigidly ‚Äòpatient perspective‚Äô so that all issues can be faced with empathy and from the point of direct personal experience of the virus. Its literature states ‚Äúthe large majority of our staff, either paid or voluntary either have hepatitis C or have had it and cleared it after treatment.‚Äù Gore‚Äôs statement, \\"once the problem of hepatitis C is solved, we‚Äôll pack up, go home and get on with our lives\\" further demonstrates the charity‚Äôs attitude. Until her death in 2007, The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick was a patron and supporter of the Trust. Roddick was convinced she had contracted hepatitis C through contaminated blood from a large blood transfusion in 1971 after the birth of her younger daughter, more than 30 years before she was diagnosed. The Trust currently provides the secretariat of the All Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group, consults with the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Department of Health, UK, is a founder member of the European Liver Patients Association (ELPA) and the International Alliance of Patient‚Äôs Organizations (IAPO) and plays a lead role in the organisation of World Hepatitis Day in the UK.

He served as President of the Rome Forum for African Archaeology and was Vice-President of both the Council for British Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society. John Alexander in 1960 Early years John Alexander was born near Brighton, and grew up in Haywards Heath, Sussex. His electrician father, having fought in and survived the First World War, died in a motorbike accident two years after the end of the war, when John and his younger brother were four and two years old. The boys were looked after by female relatives for some years, until their mother Lily was able to qualify as a teacher to support the family. From 1933 to 1941, he was educated at Varndean School (formerly Varndean Boys School) in Brighton. He was keen on drama, and recalled that in a school production he once played Juliet to Paul Scofield's Romeo. In March 1942, John enlisted in the R.E.M.E., and was discharged to a commission in the Indian Army Ordnance Corps in August 1943, serving in Burma as a Captain until December 1946, when he was discharged with the rank of Major. In 1946, he obtained a place at Cambridge University assisted by a scheme for those whose education had been interrupted by the war. He was admitted to Pembroke College to study Modern History. While leading a walking tour in Austria during the long summer vacation, John met Yvonne Villeneau, daughter of a French family resident in London. They married, and John achieved his BA (Hons), in 1948. John then took up a teaching post at the secondary school at Hantoub, south of Khartoum in what was then Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, working for the Sudan Government Service, moving to Ahlia School, Omdurman in 1950. This was the start of a lifelong warm relationship with the people and culture of the Sudan. He was already following up an interest in archaeology, as related by Peter Shinnie, with whom he worked for the Sudan Antiquities Service during this time. Archaeology In 1951, John and Yvonne returned to England and John undertook a Postgraduate Academic Diploma in Prehistoric Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology in London (now part of UCL), studying under the visionary Gordon Childe, and specialising in pre-Roman Yugoslavia. Archaeology as a modern academic discipline was then coming into being, and John was inspired by the combination of fieldwork and theory that it offered. After competing the Dip Arch, John undertook a PhD in Archaeology at Cambridge University, focusing on the European Iron Age, which he gained in 1960. From 1956 to 1957, he held a Yugoslav Government Research Fellowship, which later formed the basis of his book 'Yugoslavia before the Roman Conquest' He then became a Lecturer in Archaeology, initially for the University of London, and then from 1970 for the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, becoming a Fellow and Lecturer in Archaeology for St John's College in 1976, when he retired from the Department. During this time he also taught in the extramural departments of both Universities and conducted several practical Summer Schools. In 1967, he spent three months as Visiting Senior Lecturer at the University of Ghana, and in 1971 the same length of time as Visiting Professor at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria.

Pacific built both highway and off- road trucks, particularly for the logging industry, heavy haulers, and fire trucks. In 1947, three former Hayes Truck employees set up their own truck building shop, Pacific Truck & Trailer. Initially based on a shipping wharf at West Coast Shipyards on False Creek, in 1948 it moved to Franklin Street, East Vancouver. In 1967 it moved to North Vancouver. By this stage it had manufactured 350 trucks and many trailers. In 1970, the business was sold to International Harvester. International managed worldwide sales, but left Pacific the design and manufacture of the products; however some of the Pacific models featured International cabins.Across the Pacific Vintage Trucks & Commercials issue 59 May 2020 pages 18-24 In 1981, International Harvester sold Pacific Truck and Trailer to Inchcape Berhad (Singapore). In October 1991, the last Pacific truck was built and the manufacturing plant was closed and torn down, with only the parts department left in operation in Vancouver. In 1994, the remnants of the company was sold to Crane Carrier Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. Crane continued until 2002, selling the Pacific name, intellectual property, and rights to Coast Powertrain of New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.Pacific Truck Manufacturing Coast Power Train In addition to the Canadian and USA markets, Pacific was selling too in Australia, New Zealand, and South East Asia. However its most impressive order was for four ultra-heavy road tractors to pull massive loads up to 370 tons for the South African Railways. These units were delivered in 1972, featured 600 hp Cummins engines, and were known as the \\"largest on-highway trucks in the world\\". Sometimes they all worked coupled forming an extra-long road train, including an extra-capacity lowloader trailer to total 860 tons gross combination mass. The well-known World War II M25 Tank Transporter (also known as Dragon Wagon) truck, commonly referred to as Pacific was not a product of Pacific Truck and Trailer but of Pacific Car and Foundry.

Its name refers to Calliope, the muse of epic poetry and a daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne (memory). The name may very possibly have been taken in direct allusion to The Calliopean Society of New York City, organized in the 1780s, which remained active up to 1831. The New York City Society has been described as \\"a queer assemblage... a club of bachelors who celebrated their indolent disengagement from the Anglo-American power establishment... and used their marginal position to prospect truths not viewed by useful and virtuous citizens of the Republic. They were one of the first of the type of masculine literary cabal that would become common after 1800: the sort of club that Washington Irving, the prince of old bachelors, nourished and that the young Federalist bachelors of arts formed after graduating from Harvard and finding themselves locked out of the halls of power by Thomas Jefferson. The groups collected the odd fellows who had given up on cultivating character and civic virtue and domestic responsibility and patriarchy and opted instead for projecting personality, indulging genius, pursuing pleasure, and damning commerce. [It] was an early version of that sort of humorous society of eccentrics portrayed by Charles Dickens in The Pickwick Papers.\\" Another literary society of the same name had been formed in Bermuda in 1790 by George Tucker, at that time under the tutelage of Josiah Meigs, who later became Professor of Moral Philosophy at Yale. Calliopean was distinguished at Yale from its rival societies Linonia and Brothers-In-Unity by a larger proportion of membership from Southern states. Increasing sectional tensions prior to the American Civil War caused Calliopean to disband in 1853. It was revived in the mid-1950s as a stricter conservative alternative to both New Deal liberalism and mainstream Republican student groups at Yale. For a bit over a decade from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, the Calliopean Society conducted a program of debates and meetings featuring guest speakers, and maintained its own library. M. Stanton Evans, Class of 1955, later a syndicated columnist and conservative activist, was one of the presidents of Calliopean during that period. In the mid-1960s, Calliopean officership became an honorific distinction passed down among prominent libertarian leaders of the Party of the Right of the Yale Political Union. Party of the Right membership commonly overlapped with Calliopean. Calliopean was subsequently remodeled into a Senior Honorary Society, on the models of the Aurelian Honor Society and the Torch Honor Society. Membership was limited to people in the Yale College senior class, but officers (appointed by the president) could be chosen from any class. Membership was annually awarded each spring by the Calliopean president and director (on a non-political basis) to rising seniors of exceptional spirit, intelligence, and talent. Calliopean became increasingly active during the 1970s during the presidency of Martin D. \\"Chip\\" Gatter, Class of 1973, holding annual parties and special events in unusual locations in accordance with a cryptic constitutional provision permitting official meetings to be held only \\"on street corners and in dark alleys\\" and adopting a program of promoting \\"intellectual diversity at any cost\\". For many decades, the Calliopean Society had no physical location, listing itself as located at \\"1985 Yale Station, New Haven, Connecticut 06520\\". Its 1985 box number had been chosen to refer to the inevitable victory of the West over the collectivist totalitarianism described in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. During much of the 1970s and 1980s, Calliopean was given by the university use of the attic space in Bingham Hall equipped with an old observatory dome. Calliope is commemorated on the Yale University campus by Calliope Court, one of three small courtyards within Branford College. These courtyards were named for literary societies that donated their libraries to Yale.

In 1914, the park became the home of the Beddington family until 1945, when it was sold to John Spedan Lewis, founder of the John Lewis Partnership. Lewis lived at Longstock House throughout his retirement until his death in 1963, after which the house became a retreat for the company's executives. The park is today home to a retail horticultural emporium, the Longstock Park Nursery, and also accommodates an arboretum and water gardens.

A Mist Propagation House, one of the earliest of its kind, was built soon afterwards, and John Brooks hired as Propagator. The nursery is set in and around a brick and flint walled garden, and is home to the NCCPG National Collections of Buddleja and Clematis viticella, and the Gilchrist Collection of Penstemons. Immediately to the south is an 80 m herbaceous border; running parallel with it is a clematis and fruit tree archway, flanked by beds of Buddleja cultivars. The nursery and walled garden are open to the public throughout the year. Water gardens The water gardens comprise three hectares of woodland garden with lakes and interconnecting islands, declared 'the finest water gardens in the world' by the International Water Lily Society. The gardens were formed by accident; in 1870, Alfred and Arthur East, the owners of Longstock House, had gravel dredged from the banks of the River Test to construct a private road to their property, creating the lake in the process. After the Easts sold the property in 1914, Reginald Beddington, son of the new owner, elected to make an aesthetic feature of the lake. The water gardens are usually open to the public on alternate weekends during the summer. An entrance fee is levied; no dogs except guide dogs are admitted. Arboretum The arboretum was started in 1869, and now comprises 28 hectares of mature trees including a pinetum with many exotic conifers. The arboretum is opened to the public in concert with the water gardens. Location The Park is near the town of Stockbridge, which lies 2.7 miles (3.5 km) to the south-west.

Publications are made available in English, Hebrew, Hungarian, Russian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Yiddish. The organization maintains a circulating library of books particularly related to Judaism and Jewish culture. History JBI International was founded as the Jewish Braille Institute of America on April 22, 1931, in the Manhattan borough of New York City by Leopold Dubov, with the assistance of Rabbi Michael Aaronson. JBI was funded in large part by the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods, to whom Aaronson appealed on Dubov's behalf for assistance. In spite of its location specific name, its foundational purposes included compiling a census of blind Jews throughout the world and publishing a free international Braille magazine of Jewish culture. It also intended to adapt the Moon type writing system into Yiddish and Hebrew and to devise an international Hebrew Braille code. Other focuses included the religious instruction of blind Jewish children and the development of a Braille library for blind Jewish people of all ages. By 1932, the JBI had begun publication of its monthly The Jewish Braille Review and opened its library. The National Federation, now known as the Women of Reform Judaism, continued to support the JBI, not only financially but through service, developing an international network of members to assist in translating for and disseminating books to its target audience. The International Hebrew Braille Code One of the primary challenges faced by the JBI was the lack of a uniform Hebrew Braille. JBI assembled an international panel to address the problem, and the first iteration of the International Hebrew Braille Code was produced in 1936, undergoing further refinements until its completion in 1944. One of the early masters of the new alphabet, Mrs. Harry A. Cole of Cleveland, Ohio, was called upon by JBI to under the first translation of the Hebrew Bible into Braille. She worked on the task of translation single-handedly for five years, although proofreaders scrutinized her work, before she completed the first Braille edition of the Hebrew Bible. In 1950, JBI International published the first Braille Torah. In 1955, the JBI began a drive to help blind Jewish children achieve maturity in the Jewish faith through direct intervention or correspondence courses. In 1956, the Canadian Jewish Review opined that, \\"the institute has become the source of Jewish culture and learning for the blind\\", noting that the International Hebrew Braille Code it had created had been used \\"to supersede and replace several regional Hebrew Braille alphabets that had long been considered inadequate.\\" Relocation 110 East 30th St As the institution grew, it relocated several times. In 1953, it moved to 101 West Fifty-fifth Street. In 1959, it relocated its headquarters to East 48th Street of New York City; Helen Keller, then in her late 70s, sent a message to its dedication ceremony indicating that \\"With pride, I still read the Jewish Braille Review, which the Institute publishes for the blind, and bless the spirit of sympathy and brotherhood in which it serves both Jews and Christians in many lands.\\" By 1961, it housed in its library there 10,000 books in Braille as well as an extensive collection of audio books. In 1968, it moved again to 110 East 30th Street in Manhattan, where it has remained. In 1972, when its library consisted of over 20,000 volumes, the new headquarters made press by developing a \\"touch-and-smell fragrance garden\\" on its grounds for the benefit of the blind. At that time, the JBI facilities also included a sound studio wherein it could produce its audio books. The Institution was renamed in 2001.

It is aimed at \\"readers and lapsed readers\\" of all ages and commuters with limited time, and was originally launched in 2010 as a sister paper to The Independent. It was later acquired by Johnston Press in 2016 after The Independent shifted to a digital-only model. The i came under the control of JPIMedia a day after Johnston Press filed for administration on 16 November 2018. The paper and its website were bought by the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) on 29 November 2019, for ¬£49.6 million. On 6 December 2019 the Competition and Markets Authority served an initial enforcement order on DMGT and DMG Media Limited requiring the paper to be run separately pending investigation. The i was named British National Newspaper of the Year in 2015. Since its inception, the i has expanded its layout and coverage, adding special sections for notable events and revamping its weekend edition. The paper had an average daily circulation of 302,757 in March 2013, significantly more than The Independent, though that figure has since continued to decline, and had dropped to 233,869 by February 2019. The paper is classified as a 'quality' in the UK market but is published in the standard compact tabloid-size format. History= Founding  A press statement released on the website of The Independent on 19 October 2010 announced the launch of the i. Also in October 2010, Independent Print Limited launched an advertising campaign to promote the new publication. The first issue of the i went on sale for 20p on 26 October 2010, along with a new-look version of The Independent. Starting on 7 May 2011 a Saturday edition was published, with more pages and at the price of 30p. This increased to 40p in January 2014, with the weekday edition rising to 30p. In September 2016, the price was raised to 60p, with the weekday edition rising to 50p. The i was then named National Newspaper of the Year in 2015. At the start of September 2017, the price rose once again, to 60p for the weekday edition and 80p for the relaunched i weekend beginning later that month. The paper cited the rising cost of materials needed to print the paper and the increasingly difficult environment in which print journalism finds itself.  2016‚Äì2018  On 11 February 2016, it was revealed that regional publisher Johnston Press, which owned the Yorkshire Post and The Scotsman, were in the advanced stages of talks to buy the i for around ¬£24 million. The acquisition was completed before The Independent became a digital-only publication, and a \\"significant number\\" of staff joined the team from The Independent. The new editorial team was announced in April 2016 and moved one floor down in Northcliffe House. On 30 September 2017, a new, redesigned, version of the weekend edition of the i went on sale, costing 80p. This relaunch of the weekend paper saw circulation rise by around 30,000, to around 290,000 of the first edition of the redesigned paper being sold. By August 2018, the weekend edition had become the strongest day of trading for the i. In December 2017, the owners of the i, Johnston Press, announced the newspaper was bringing in a monthly profit of around ¬£1 million. They stated that this was the result of: \\"Johnston Press management‚Äôs strategy of investing in improved content under editor Olly Duff's clear leadership, increased brand awareness, distribution, and advertiser solutions, while delivering efficiencies\\". A February 2018 trading update from parent company Johnston Press stated that the paper held a 20% market share of the 'Quality' weekday market. The i website, inews.co.uk, was reported to attract around two million unique viewers at the start of 2018, but that figure had grown 457% by November, with Comscore reporting unique visitors to the website then stood at 5.2 million, surpassing the reach of The Times and Huffington Post UK.  2018  In November 2018, ownership of the i alongside the other assets of Johnston Press were transferred in a pre-packaged administration deal to JPIMedia, a company set up by the bondholders of Johnston Press, after several attempts to restructure the debt or sell the business were unsuccessful.  2019‚Äìpresent  On 14 September 2019, The iweekend price rose from ¬£1 to ¬£1.20. On 29 November 2019, it was announced that JPIMedia had sold the i newspaper and website to the Daily Mail and General Trust, which owns the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline. Lord Rothermere, the chair of DMGT, said that the paper would maintain its politically independent editorial style.  Format  The i is tabloid-size and stapled, and the first issue contained 56 pages. The Friday edition of the paper, which contains the \\"Friday\\" section, has a slightly increased page count, at around 65. The weekend version of the paper is significantly larger than the weekday version, containing 87 pages. The i prides itself on having no supplements, something common in many other quality British newspapers, saying they want to give readers the best experience without supplements that \\"clog up\\" recycling bins. The newspaper contains \\"matrices\\" for news, business and sports‚Äîsmall paragraphs of information which are expanded upon in full articles further on in the paper. The title also includes a features section titled iQ, Arts and Business sections and a television guide. The managing director of The Independent stated several days before the newspaper went into print that the publication is designed for people who do not have much time to read a newspaper. On 20 April 2011, editor Simon Kelner announced that a Saturday edition of the i would be published, starting from 7 May 2011 and costing 30 pence, 10 pence more than the weekday version. The paper is now 65p on weekdays and ¬£1.20 at the weekend, running Monday to Saturday (although the Saturday edition is also sold on Sunday). The paper now runs a subscription, whereby customers can buy pre-paid vouchers to exchange for their copy of the paper. The subscription can be either six months or a year long and can be chosen Monday to Friday or including Saturday. There is also a discounted student subscription that lasts for one academic year. Political stance The i takes a political stance on the centre of the political spectrum, with many front-page headline articles being concerned with social issues and inequality - but it also claims to be politically balanced and to publish points of view from both left and right. Nick Clegg, former UK Deputy Prime Minister and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, a centrist party, is a fortnightly columnist for the i. His column usually features in the \\"My View\\" comment section of the paper. During an interview for the i in December 2017, Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn declared himself to be a dedicated reader of the i, saying that its compact size and concise articles suited his busy lifestyle as Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. During the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union, held in June 2016, the paper chose not to declare for either \\"leave\\" or \\"remain\\", unlike a majority of other British newspapers who came out for either side of the debate. In the 2017 UK general election, the i chose not to endorse a political party.i‚Äôs 2017 election manifesto. i. Published 19 April 2017. Retrieved 4 June 2017.  Reputation  The i has developed a strong national reputation over time. The paper is understood to be highly regarded by many journalists, especially the former employees of The Independent who had worked on the title. The i was also found in a 2018 poll to be the second-most trusted news brand in the UK after The Guardian. Since being named National Newspaper of the Year at the 2015 News Awards, the i has also gone on to win and be shortlisted for numerous awards in the UK. At the 2017 Press Awards, the i secured six nominations. Katy Balls was a finalist alongside Stephen Bush for Political Commentary of the Year, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown for Broadsheet Columnist of the Year, Alice Jones for Critic of the Year, Steve Connor for Science Editor of the Year, Kim Sengupta for Foreign Reporter of the Year, Sam Cunningham for Sports Journalist of the Year, while the paper itself was nominated for Best News Site of the Year. At the 2017 British Sports Journalism Awards, Hugo Lowell was nominated for Young Sports Writer of the Year. At the 2018 British Media Awards, the i won Gold in the Launch of the Year category for i weekend and Editorial Campaign of the Year category for its coverage of NHS Cuts. The paper were also runner-ups for Print Product of the Year and Media Brand of the Year. In March 2019, the i overtook The Guardian to become the most trusted digital newsbrand. At the 2019 British Media Awards, the i won Gold in the Media Brand of the Year category, Silver for the Digital Product of the Year, and Bronze in the Print Product of the Year category.

Built in the 1860s by the village and a fraternal society, it has served as home for both entities throughout its history, as well as providing space for Chester Township officials and community gatherings. Along with numerous other buildings in the village, it has been named a historic site. Community history The vicinity of Chesterville was one of the first-settled parts of Knox County, as pioneers began arriving soon after 1803, and Chester Township was created in 1812, but the advance of civilization was slow;Perrin, W.H., and J.H. Battle. History of Morrow County and Ohio. Chicago: O.L. Baskin, 1880. only after the conclusion of the War of 1812 did the area begin to prosper. Merchant Enos Miles, who moved to the township in 1815, platted the village of Chester in 1830. During its first decades, the village prospered; multiple schools were established,McQuillin, Steven. '. National Park Service, 1978-11. and numerous grand Greek Revival buildings lined the streets, but Chesterville lost to Mount Gilead in its attempt to be named the county seat when Morrow County was established in the 1850s, and Chesterville withered as the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway built through Mount Gilead. The village was incorporated in 1860. Building history Among the community organizations active in Chesterville was Lodge 204 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, organized in 1852. Prosperous within a few years of its establishment, the lodge soon owned its own hall, and in 1867 the members joined with the village and helped to construct the town hall, the upper story of which the lodge constructed at a cost of $1,200. Besides serving as a place for village officials to meet, the hall served as a community center; in 1880, the residents debated adding a stage and scenery, using money obtained from railroad taxes, and it ended up serving as a music performance venue for part of its history. In later years, the building also became home to Chester Township officials. Architecture Built on a foundation of sandstone, the Town Hall is a weatherboarded structure with a metal roof pierced by a single chimney. Two and a half stories tall, the narrow facade and rear rise to gables, while the sides are substantially longer than the ends. Fourteen side windows are present in seven bays, while the facade features six sash windows in three bays: a small window in the gable, one in each second-story bay, and one in each end bay on the first story, while the double doors of the main entrance occupy the middle of the first story. Shutters are provided for the windows in the first story of the facade., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-23. Preservation During the 1970s, a community group known as Chester Community Concerns was formed to encourage preservation of the village's historic architecture. In 1978, the group sponsored a project to record the village's historic buildings with the Ohio Historic Inventory, a historic preservation survey, with the goal of nominating the most important historic properties for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Using the multiple property submission process, nine Chesterville buildings were added to the Register in August 1979: the town hall, the Methodist Church, the Jarvis and Enos Miles Houses on Portland Street, the Old Union School, the post office and the A.B. Sears House on Sandusky Street, and the Old Bartlett and Goble Store and an unnamed commercial building at the village's main intersection. The town hall qualified both because of its well-preserved historic architecture and because of its place in local history.

The game is the sequel to Skidmarks and as such was also termed Skidmarks 2 and Super Skidmarks 2 by commentators. The game features ‚Äúminimally realistic‚Äù action viewed from an isometric perspective as well as novelty vehicles such as wheeled cows and caravans. Various methods such as joypad adapters and link systems are employed to allow multiple players to compete, up to a maximum of 8. The game was critically acclaimed and a best- seller in the UK. Several upgrades to the Amiga original were released as well as conversions for the Amiga CD32 and Sega Mega Drive, the latter published by Codemasters. Development Super Skidmarks was developed by New Zealand- based Acid Software, predominantly designed and written by Chris Blackbourn. The game is the sequel to Skidmarks and was originally intended as an expanded version containing new tracks and a track editor before being developed into a full sequel (though the final game featured no track editor). The first game suffered problems with disk accessing and crashes which were fixed for Super Skidmarks, partly through the ability to install the game on a hard drive. The game includes twice the number of tracks as in the original as well as an increased number of vehicles and competitions and a more difficult single- player mode. The artificial intelligence was made to be more intelligent and realistic. Skidmarks has a two-player split screen mode while the sequel allows a three-way split screen or four players to play using a whole screen in a mode inspired by Micro Machines. Players can use multiple joysticks rather than share a keyboard. Another additional feature is the ability to attach a caravan to the player's vehicle, dramatically affecting the handling. A Mega Drive conversion was published by Codemasters. Reception Amiga Power said that the widescreen link mode, which allows up to 8 players simultaneously, ‚Äúelevates the game to near divine status‚Äù though pointed out that only a small minority of players who owned two A1200s could experience the feature and gave the A1200 version a higher score. The game went on to be ranked the 24th best game of all time in the magazine.Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996 Amiga Computing praised the variety of humorous vehicles such as cows, caravans, Volkswagens and Minis. The magazine wrote that the graphics were simple but enjoyable, but felt the menus could have benefited from a more functional user-interface. It concluded: ‚ÄúThis is one of the most playable and fun race-em-ups around with the vast amount of new features added it‚Äôs certainly worth a look‚Äù. Amiga Format called the game ‚Äúnigh on perfect‚Äù and ‚Äúa completely social sport‚Äù which ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be realised through any medium other than a computer‚Äù. It felt the game was best when played by multiple people and said: ‚ÄúDo yourself a favour, buy this game‚Äù. CU Amiga called the wheeled cows ‚Äútremendous fun‚Äù but complained of a difficult learning curve. On balance the magazine felt Super Skidmarks was ‚Äúone of the best games I‚Äôve ever played, certainly the best so far this year‚Äù. ACAR said: ‚ÄúSuper Skidmarks is where it‚Äôs at in fun to play, thoroughly unrealistic race games. Brilliant fun.‚Äù The game was a best-seller in the UK.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 June 1972, and was vested in the Trust on 26 March 1974. The small flint and stone Norman Anglican Church of St Andrew has an apse at the east end and a barrel vault roof which curves around it. The roof was replaced and windows inserted in the 16th century. The oak door is heavily studded. The interior has limewashed walls, a 15th-century font and flag stone floor, along with early 18th-century oak fittings. The eighteenth century oak pews, the pulpit, screen, communion rails and matching table with barley sugar turned legs, and other woodwork were provided by William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, who had been raised in the village of Shapwick and whose family lived locally. The west end has a late medieval gallery with a panelled front which was probably originally a rood screen. The roof is topped by a small weatherboard belfry which resembles a dovecote. By the early 20th century, the church had fallen into disrepair and was being used as an animal shelter by a local farmer. Repairs were paid for by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings who sold a collection of Thomas Hardy‚Äôs manuscripts to raise the funding. The work was supervised by A. R. Powys who also oversaw the work at the Old St Cuthbert's Church, Oborne.

Day's unconventional style of releasing and distributing music helped him reach more than 1,000,000 subscribers and over 130 million views on his YouTube channel. Personal life Alex Richard George Day was born in Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering. Day grew up in Hornchurch, where he started his YouTube channel, nerimon, in 2006. He attended university but never received his degree, instead treating his independent music and video blogging as a full-time profession. He worked in the Regent Street Apple Store during 2009. Until 2013, Day used to live with friend, collaborator and bandmate Charlie McDonnell. In August 2010, Day briefly lived in Zambia whilst taking part in the World Vision Vlogger charity event. He filmed and shared his experiences on YouTube. He has also described music producer Jonathan King as a 'dear friend'The Underground Storyteller (2014) p. 224 and remains a staunch defender of King's innocence of sexual assault charges. Day announced on 14 February 2014 that he had been dating fellow YouTuber Carrie Hope Fletcher since October 2013. However, Fletcher announced their break-up via Twitter on 14 March 2014. Day originally identified as an atheist but began to follow Buddhist teachings after visiting the Plum Village Monastery in mid 2014. Day also identifies as a minimalist.  Sexual Manipulation allegations  In March 2014, Day admitted to having previously engaged in \\"manipulative relationships\\" with some women, saying \\"the model of consent that I followed... was that only, 'no' meant, 'no'. That is not what consent is\\". This led to a previous friend and coworker Charlie McDonnell stating \\"I just don't feel able to call Alex a friend of mine any more.\\" Following the release of the news, Day posted on his official blog, announcing that he has taken down his merchandise and artist pages from his label's website. Allegedly, Day attempted to reach out to McDonnell but his attempts fell through as he 'wanted to have a conversation with him over the phone or preferably face-to-face and he didn't want to do that because he felt it would be upsetting. He said 'I'd only be happy to do it over email' because that makes him more comfortable. So I didn't want to do it his way and he didn't want to do it my way so we never had the conversation'. On 5 October 2014, after a seven-month hiatus, Day released a statement defending himself from the allegations, announcing that he \\"didn't realise at the time that [the women] felt pressured\\", and apologised to them. He also commented on the 'militant' reaction from social networking site Tumblr, stating \\"At some point you have to just start sticking up for yourself and especially when there's such an angry torrent of abuse, like verbal abuse‚ÄîI don't know if it counts as verbal when it's written down‚Äîbut like slander I guess... whatever the thing is, people just being absolutely horrible to anyone who doesn't agree with them\\". His response was criticised by several YouTube contributors such as Laci Green, Jack Howard and Tomska.

In June 2009, the band released its first self-titled album by YouTube musicians' record label DFTBA Records and a second album Still Got Legs in July 2011. Wired noted that Chameleon Circuit \\"puts out titles that could pass for chart-toppers ‚Äì if they weren't excessively nerdy in the subject matter department.\\" Day released his debut album Parrot Stories in April 2009 through DFTBA Records, which was produced by fellow musician and friend Tom Milsom. This was then followed by an EP, 117% Complete, in March 2010 which contained songs referencing various video games such as Pok√©mon. His second album, The World Is Mine (I Don't Know Anything), was released in June 2010 contained a more electronic-dance sound than his previous folk album. To ensure he did not alienate his fans of his debut album, Day released an EP of acoustic songs, Soup Sessions: Acoustic, in November 2010 which contained newly recorded acoustic versions of half the songs on the album. Day was a featured artist on the BBC Two reality show Chartjackers in 2009. The programme challenged four YouTube video producers to write, record and release a pop song in 10 weeks, using YouTube as a tool to get lyrics and singers, with the proceeds going to the BBC Children in Need charity. The completed single, entitled \\"I've Got Nothing\\", was sung by vocalists Miranda Chartrand and Adam Nichols, and was released worldwide through the iTunes Store on 9 November 2009. It was reviewed with varying degrees of approval by various media outlets, including The Times, Yahoo! Music's James Masterton, BBC Radio 1's Chart Blog and Popjustice. The song peaked at No. 36 on the UK Singles Chart and raised almost ¬£10,000 for Children in Need. Day also appeared with the Chartjackers at the Hammersmith Apollo for the BBC Switch Live 2009 show, along with artists such as Black Eyed Peas, N-Dubz, and Pixie Lott. Day was also a member of Youstage, an ad-hoc group of YouTube vloggers who competed successfully on the BBC Three talent show Upstaged during March 2008. ‚Äì Includes group photo Epigrams & Interludes: 2011‚Äì2013 For Christmas 2011, Day released his single \\"Forever Yours\\", which reached No. 4 in the UK Singles chart after selling over 50,000 copies in one week. Day released the single without support from a record label or TV coverage, and outsold songs from multi- platinum artists such as Coldplay, Rihanna, and Katy Perry. The Official Charts Company lauded Day's success, stating \\" 'Forever Yours' is certainly one of the most successful self-released tracks we have ever seen, the Official Charts are based on sales, and sales alone, so Alex's achievements this week are a genuine reflection of the passion of his army of fans, and of course, the power of social media.\\" Day also released 11 alternate versions of \\"Forever Yours\\", which he confirmed that all sales revenue made from the alternate versions would be going to charity, chiefly to World Vision. On 1 April 2012, Day released his second single, \\"Lady Godiva\\", a cover of the 1966 Peter and Gordon song. The single was Day's first to get a physical release in UK record stores following a one-single distribution arrangement with HMV and other stores. Within its first week of release, the song charted at No. 15, making it Day's second UK Top 20 hit. The song also charted in 15 other countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Sweden, Norway, and Spain as well as reaching No. 1 in Slovenia.

Forbes. 13 June 2012. This \\"disruptive\\" model largely ignored the conventional method of releasing one single every few months, and its success was profiled in MTV and Billboard. Day has received millions of plays for his music by releasing music videos on YouTube, with his most popular being the 2011 single \\"Forever Yours\\", whose music video reached 1.5 million views in its first week of release. The video has since been removed from the website by Charlie McDonnell. On 16 December 2012, he attempted to break a world record with his song \\"Stupid Stupid\\". The song later peaked on UK charts at No. 25. In order to promote the single, Day held a one-day tour entitled Stupidfest, which was free for entry.http://alexdaymusic.com/post/37789723604/why-music-should-be-an-event Announcement of Stupidfest Day released his third album, Epigrams and Interludes, on 17 March 2013.

The album debuted at No. 2 on the UK iTunes charts. Day partnered with the file sharing service BitTorrent for an exclusive bundle with the release of Epigrams and Interludes. The package was downloaded over 1 million times in the first week of release. Hiatus, Return and Nowhere Left To Hide: 2014 - 2015 In March 2014, Day removed his artist pages, merchandise and information from his record label, DFTBA Records following accusations of sexual manipulation. His official website alexdaymusic.com has also been taken down, the content being replaced with generic landscape photos. On 5 October 2014, Day uploaded a video on his YouTube channel, his first video since February 2014. It was titled \\"The Past\\". In the video, Day talks about his side of the allegations accused of him, as well as his thoughts and opinion on the matter. Day also mentioned that he planned on creating and uploading more videos talking about the situation. On 10 January 2015, Day uploaded his new single, \\"Scared Like Me\\", to YouTube and thus announced his musical return. It was his first new song in two years. Day also announced that he would be releasing a new album on 4 October 2015 and throughout the year he would release three more singles from this album. It was later announced that this album would be called 'Nowhere Left To Hide'. On 3 April 2015, Day uploaded a new track to his channel, which was a cover of Chumbawamba's Ugh! Your Ugly Houses!. It was intended as a protest single, to be released on the week of the 2015 UK General Election, focusing on the lack of representativeness of the UK government and electoral system. Day aimed for the single to chart at number 1 in the UK on the track's week of release, however it failed to chart. He later announced that this song would not be part of his fourth album, but instead a cover album he would release at a later date. On 17 May 2015, Day released a new single available to download on his website, entitled 'Keep Me Up'. His fourth and final single, titled 'Beyond You' was released on 26 July 2015. On 3 October, Day announced he would release the album a day early for all of those who signed on for the newsletter. He also announced that rather than a physical CD edition, Nowhere Left To Hide would be released as a physical USB with the album on. On the album, Day stated 'This was a hard album to make. In a lot of ways, it was an album I needed to make. It‚Äôs quite raw and makes me feel a bit exposed. But I love it and I‚Äôm very proud to have it and to share it. I think parts of it are my best work and overall it‚Äôs probably the most cohesive release I‚Äôve ever put out'. Further releases:Split Infinities , Sunset & retirement from YouTube: 2016 ‚Äì 2019 In December 2015, Day announced he had recorded five new songs for an untitled studio release in the future. On 28 January 2016 he confirmed the album would be called Split Infinities and would be the first of his solo albums to feature a backing band. He released it on 30 September 2016. Day released his sixth album Sunset on streaming platforms in October 2019. Day has now deleted his main channel Nerimon and a majority of his online presence to pursue a career outside of YouTube. He still creates content on Patreon. Other work=YouTube Alex Day at VidCon 2010 Day was called \\"one of Britain's most popular YouTubers.\\" He created his first YouTube channel, Nerimon, as a teenager making videos in his bedroom, stating, \\"I was making a video podcast to entertain family and friends ‚Äì just a little comedy series.\\" He received international attention for his video entitled 'Alex and Liam Do Walmart' in which he visited the American Superstar Walmart megastore alongside fellow YouTubers and Chameleon Circuit band members, Liam Dryden and Michael Aranda. CBS called the titular vloggers 'delightfully confused,' while the Huffington Post described the video as possibly providing detail into American Pop Culture, placing a poll at the end of their article. Day further found success through a popular series of videos entitled Alex Reads Twilight, in which he read and critically analysed the popular young-adult novel Twilight, by Stephenie Meyer. The videos have received a total of over 14 million views. Amongst these, Day's YouTube channel also contains travel vlogs, music videos and satirical rants. In June 2014, he had reached over a million subscribers and his videos had been watched over 100 million times. On his celebrity, Day has stated he became disillusioned with it. He said \\"I like the focus not being on me. I‚Äôve never really liked the recognition very much. I just wanna make the best work I can make\\". After losing an average of over 10,000 subscribers per month after sexual abuse allegations were made against him, as of May 2015, Day has less than one million subscribers. In early 2015, Day stated that he was discontinuing his Nerimon channel in May 2015 after releasing what was then his final video on that platform, in order to set up a new channel entitled The Daily Day. In December 2015, Day announced his return to Nerimon. After dwindling success, Day retired and deleted the Nerimon channel. He eventually set up a patreon and continues to produce music, videos and content through donations. =The Daily Day= On 10 May 2015, Day uploaded his final video to his Nerimon channel, entitled \\"Goodbye Nerimon\\" (last video!). Within it, he explained that he was launching a new YouTube channel called The Daily Day, which would feature a new vlog everyday, on different themes to his original channel. Day stated that the creation of a new channel was to \\"define a fresh start and have a channel focused on my new direction, with an active audience I know is there just for that\\", and to clear out dead subscribers from the old channel after the loss of viewership. As of 18 May 2015, the Daily Day channel has accumulated 13,000 subscribers and 44,000 video views. Unlike his previous channel, Nerimon, The Daily Day is a shared channel in which other creators can share and distribute their own videos on mindfulness. Therefore, the channel has featured various other hosts, featuring videos created by people other than Day. After a steady decline in viewers over the following years, in 2020 Day posted a final video to his channel, stating he would be moving away from his online presence as he was pursuing other employment. He has been inactive online since. Writing In late 2013, Day announced that he had completed work on his first book; with the working title The Underground Storyteller, the book was about his experiences with the London Underground. It was 12 chapters in length and was scheduled to be published in July 2014. It was cancelled by the publishers. On 13 October 2014, Day announced online that he was releasing his book independently, keeping the name of The Underground Storyteller, and that he will sign and number the first thousand copies. Day's second book was the memoir Living and Dying on the Internet, which detailed his personal experiences as a YouTuber and the controversies surrounding his sexual abuse allegations. During its conception and writing, Carrie Hope Fletcher threatened legal action in regards to her inclusion in the book. Though nothing came of this, Fletcher and many other YouTubers and ex-colleagues of Day spoke out against the release of the book and encouraged their followers not to purchase it. The book was released on 5 August 2018. Reception Day's \\"disruptive distribution\\" strategy has been lauded as \\"the future of music\\". He has been noted as one of the most successful and popular YouTubers in Britain. Day has been profiled on BBC and CNN and in world publications like Forbes, The Guardian and Holy Moly. Day unlisted a video about cosplaying entitled \\"Big Girls in Costumes\\" after criticism that he was belittling obese women who took part in the activity. He stated that it was \\"satirical\\" and that, \\"I'm not going to take the video down because I don‚Äôt want to pretend this didn't happen ‚Äì running away from mistakes isn't how you solve them ‚Äì but I have made the video unlisted so you can only see it if you have the link. I think that's a good compromise between not risking more people being hurt by the content but also not trying to hide the mistake. I‚Äôve also taken the ads off it.\\" Day's return to YouTube in October 2014 was met with an extremely negative response, in particular his decision to monetise response videos to the sexual abuse allegations.

She is immortalized on a frieze in a Voortrekker monument in Pretoria, South Africa  Biography  Born to an Italian family originally from Piedmont, Theresa Viglione moved to South Africa with her family in the early 19th century. Her family is believed to have belonged to the Valdese congregation, a Protestant church in western Piedmont, whose members were forced to flee Piedmont--then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia --because of discrimination against Protestants by the local authorities.  Background  On February 6, 1838, a group of Voortrekkers and their servants went to negotiate with the Zulu king Dingane. The party was led by Piet Retief, an Afrikaner leader. The king received Retief and his group at his cattle-kraal, and they began to discuss a treaty amending a previous treaty signed in January 1836. Initially he was obstructive about drawing up the treaty, but eventually he signed it. He invited the Voortrekkers to share some sourgbeer with him. The trekkers left their muskets outside, entered the kraal and sat at the King‚Äôs feet. While beer was served the surrounding warriors began to dance and shout. The King leapt to his feet and yelled ‚Äùbuladani abatagati!‚Äù (‚ÄúKill the wizards!‚Äù). The Voortrekkers were taken to be executed. They were impaled and their bodies left on a hillside to be eaten by wild animals, as was Dingane's custom with his enemies. Piet Retief was the last to be killed. Dingane gave orders for the Voortrekker laagers to be attacked, which would have plunged the migrant movement into disarray. The Zulus headed towards Natal to annihilate the rest of the Voortrekkers, who were encamped in the countryside watered by the rivers Bloukrans, Bushman and Mooi streams. Gerrit Maritz, the acting commander in Retief‚Äôs absence, was near Bushman's River. The Zulus, with a total strength of about three regiments, almost killed all of the Lieberberg, Prinsloo, Botha, and Bezuidenhouts laagers. A band of Italian traders were encamped not far from the laagers, where many women and children were killed. Theresa Viglione was one of them.

History Little is known about the origins of the festival. A book published in 1904 by Harold Sadler suggests the festival was a local event held in the grounds of Aston Hall to the east of the town. Aston Hall was at the time owned by Colonel Howard-McClean. Sadler's book marks the festival as being The Hadley Orpheus Choir's first competitive success. Revival Research carried out as part of the Shifnal Town Planhttp://www.shifnaltownplan.org in 2008 suggested residents of the town were interested in staging a festival of arts, culture and entertainment. A committee was formed of volunteers and a date was announced for the first modern Shifnal festival in September 2010. The committee secured funding from the town council and applied for a series of grants from a number of sources. The Shifnal Festival should not be confused with V Festival, a music festival at the nearby Weston Park (although the Weston Park address is classed as \\"Nr Shifnal\\"). Format The festival aimed itself at all age group and claimed to provide something for everyone. Typically incorporated into the programme were: *Live Music. *An art exhibition which featured pieces my local artists. A theme was often given for the pieces to conform to. *A photographic exhibition, which was often themed and formed part of a competition. *A form of drama or performing arts show. *Dance workshops or classes. *Craft workshops and fairs. *A spirituality element such as choral singing or religion based art. *Spoken word and poetry events. *A Film event. *A family fun day. *Fringe events organised by local businesses and groups. Awards In 2010 the Festival was Commended by the Action for Market Town Awards.

He is best known for his pioneering work in wetland archaeology and Iron Age hillforts in Ireland. He was Professor of Celtic Archaeology in University College, Dublin (UCD) for more than thirty years, and served as chair of the Department of Celtic Archeology at UCD from 1996 to his retirement in 2007. Early life and education Barry Joseph Raftery was born in Dublin, Ireland on 16 August, 1944. He was the son of an Irish father and German mother, Joseph and Lotte Raftery. His father, Joseph, was an archaeologist who specialized in prehistoric Ireland and was keeper of Irish antiquities and Director of the National Museum of Ireland during his long career. Barry Raftery developed an interest in archaeology at the age of ten, after spending two summers working with his father in the excavations at Lough Gara. Raftery attended Belvedere College secondary school in Dublin. He studied archaeology and geography at UCD where he earned a BA in 1965. He met his future wife, Nuala Sproule at the University. Rafferty earned an MA at UCD in 1967. He completed his PhD in 1977 after ten years of further studies and research in Europe and Ireland. Career From 1969 to 1970, Raftery spent a year as a visiting professor of European prehistory at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He travelled throughout Europe, visiting museums, research institutes and excavations, furthering his studies of the European Iron Age. In 1970, he was appointed to a lectureship in the Department of Archaeology at UCD. During the 1970's, his research centered on late prehistoric hillforts in Ireland; His most important project was the excavation of Rathgall Hillfort in County Wicklow. In 1981, Raftery was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt research fellowship at the University of Marburg, where he spent two years. During the 1980's, Raftery research interests turned to wetland archeology. In 1985, he initiated a new research program at UCD on prehistoric Irish wetland sites. His initial project was the study of the trackways of raised bogs in Ireland. His first excavation resulted in the most important find of his career, the massive, Iron Age Corlea Trackway in County Longford. Raftery was instrumental in establishing the Irish Archeological Wetland Unit (IAWU] at UCD in 1990. He led the IAWU excavation at the Corlea site again in 1991. His team was able to successfully lift and preserve a large portion of the ancient track and understructure. It was the largest conversation project undertaken in Ireland at the time. In 1994, Raftery published his seminal work, Pagan Celtic Ireland: The Enigma of the Irish Iron Age. Raftery was visiting prof at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich from 1988 to 1990, at Kiel University in 1991 and the University of Vienna in 1997. He was appointed chair of Celtic Archeology at UCD in 1996. Raftery retired in 2007.

A double fold is made by first folding the test piece backwards and then forwards to its initial position (one complete oscillation). A double fold is a process of folding a paper sample first backwards and then forwards about the same line, i.e. one complete oscillation. The number of double folds that is required to make a test piece break is used to determine the material's folding endurance and fold number. The total folding angle (about the folding line) differs depending on which folding tester is used, for instance the K√∂hler‚ÄìMolin instrument folds about 156¬∞ on each side of the vertical line, resulting in a complete oscillation of about 2 √ó 312¬∞ for each double fold, while the MIT instrument employs a folding angle of about 135¬∞ on each side (that is, a complete oscillation of about 2 √ó 270¬∞ for each complete double fold).ISO 5626:1993 Paper - Determination of folding endurance, Annex A.

This institute is located at Hyderabad near Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL). Being the only major balloon facility in the world close to the geomagnetic equator, this facility is extensively used by researchers from all over the world. History Ballooning activity in India was prompted by research into atmospheric exploration and cosmic ray studies. During the 1940s, Dr. Homi J. Bhabha of TIFR started sending balloons up to an altitude of 25 km to study secondary cosmic radiation. Due to unique geographic reasons Hyderabad was selected for stratospheric balloon launches. After various diplomatic meetings arrangements were made by US and Indian organisations to jointly launch balloons from Hyderabad. The first launch had support of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) and TIFR. The launches were carried out from two locations. US balloons were launched from Begumpet Airport and Indian balloons from Osmania University Campus. The first balloon was launched on 2 February 1961. During the first stage of the facility's operation, forty balloons were launched. After five years all the facilities were consolidated at Osmania University and under management of National Center for Atmospheric Research & TIFR and around 170 balloons were launched. After a few years with increasing demands for balloon flights, a relatively low population density and proximity to the geomagnetic equator, a permanent site at Hyderabad near ECIL was selected. However, presently due to rapid development this facility is today surrounded by several population settlements: by the Cherlapally Central Jail in the east; Kamala Nagar in the west; and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. in the south. Activities The campus contains a complete balloon manufacturing facility. The institute conducts balloon-based scientific experiments in X-ray and Infrared Astronomy, and in Aeronomy. Balloons from this facility are launched twice in a year, i.e. in summer and winter. NBF also regularly monitors and analyses local weather at tropospheric and stratospheric altitudes, required for making decisions about balloon launches. Under the High Altitude Balloon Development Project, a 61,000m¬≥ indigenously developed balloon penetrated into the Mesosphere on 7 January 2014, for the first time in India. Until that time, only balloons from USA and Japan had accomplished this feat.HAA Records See also * High-altitude balloon ReferencesExternal links * Category:Research institutes in Hyderabad, India Category:Atmospheric sciences Category:Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Category:Atmospheric sounding ","title":"National Balloon Facility"},{"id":"29262202","text":"German post card showing the fortifications of Paris The Fort de Nogent or Fort de Nogent-sur-Marne is a French fortification forming part of the fortifications of Paris.

The fort is now occupied by the recruitment organization for the French Foreign Legion.  Construction The Fort de Nogent is one of seventeen forts built to protect Paris at the instigation in 1840 Adolphe Thiers, prime minister of the government of Louis-Philippe. Work began in 1841, with completion in 1848, under the direction of Guillaume Dode de la Brunerie. The fort is surrounded by a pentagonal bastioned rampart on a side, in the manner of Vauban. Siege of 1870 During the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì1871), the fort was commanded by Commandant Pistoulet, with artillery under the command of Chef d'Escadron David, engineers commanded by Chef de Bataillon Revin and medical services commanded by Doctor-Major Aude of the Navy. The infantry was composed of the 31st, 61st and 77th companies of line infantry (590 men and 8 officers, and the 11th battalion and two companies of the 13th battalion of mobile forces of the Seine, with 114 men and 30 officers. All of the mobile forces were sent north to Saint-Denis on 22 September. Artillery was composed of the 2nd battery bis of the 4th Regiment with 205 men and two officers, engineers with 40 men and two officers, 18 supply personnel, and three doctors and three attendants. In December 1870, the Prussian guns bombarded the fort. The fort held out until it was given up to the Prussians at the French surrender on 26 January 1871. 1944 On 23, 24 and 25 August 1944 there was violent combat between German troops and units of the French Resistance.

The fort is part of the Thiers Wall fortifications of Paris, built under a program of defensive works initiated by Adolphe Thiers. The fort served as a prison for those involved in the French coup of 1851. Occupied by the Prussians in 1871, the fort was briefly occupied by communards during the Paris Commune. After 1874, under the direction of General Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the ring of Thiers fortifications was reinforced by a second ring of forts, reflecting the increased range of artillery during the intervening years. The Fort de Bic√™tre was not modernized at this time, since it was considered too close to Paris to be useful. From 1940 to 1944 the fort was occupied by German troops. After World War II the fort remained a military post, successively accommodating an artillery unit, an Marine infantry battalion, and from 1946 a military radio facility.  Description  In the 1840s, prime minister Adolphe Thiers proposed that Paris be transformed into a fortified city. The Thiers plan envisioned a wall around the city, reinforced by a ring of forts in the city's suburbs. Built between 1841 and 1845, the Fort de Bic√™tre was one of seventeen bastioned forts. The forts were cited in advance of the city walls to keep an enemy out of artillery range of the capital. As a result of shortages of money, manpower and materi√®l, some of the forts' armament and personnel were drawn from the Navy. The Fort de Bic√™tre was initially commanded by naval Capitaine de Fr√©gate Fournier, with an armament of 86 artillery pieces. Like many locations around Paris, the ground under the fort had been tunneled and quarried for stone. These quarries were sealed or fortified. Like all of the detached forts, the Fort de Bic√™tre was composed of an enclosing masonry wall with battlements and interior earth embankments, and was surrounded by a cleared glacis. WIth an area of , the fort is pentagonal in shape, enclosed by a wall, ditch and counterscarp.  Entry and drawbridge  The fort is entered by a large gate with flanking guardhouses. A counterweighted Poncelet drawbridge originally spanned the ditch.  Magazines  The magazines, located in the bastions flanking the entrance and on the fort's surface amount to in area, holding fifty tons of black powder. The rectangular magazines are constructed of stone with wall thicknesses of over two meters, with a blast wall at the main door to limit damage in the event of an explosion. The interior of the magazines has two levels, with wooden floors, fastened with wood pegs or bronze nails to avoid inadvertent sparks. The top of the magazine was protected by a lightning conductor.  Officers' quarters and barracks  The officers' quarters are joined with the troop barracks along the place d'armes. In 1859-60 a separate infirmary was constructed to free space for married officers. The barracks was a four story building, accommodating about seven hundred men. The roof was a terrace, less prone to fire than a roof, and offering a firing platform under combat. The ground floor housed the mess halls and non-commissioned officers' quarters. A separate kitchen was later built to expand the barracks. Only one well remains of the barracks, which have been replaced by more modern buildings.  Casemates  The Fort de Bic√™tre features thirty casemates in two groups of fifteen, one located between bastions 2 and 3, and the other between 3 and 4. The casemates measure by , on a vaulted platform covered with earth. Three mortars for close defense were located on the south side. Each casemate protected a thirty-eight-man gun crew. At present, the casemates have been renovated as office space.  Latrines  Located behind the barracks and officers' quarters, the latrines were served by an aqueduct system.  History = Construction to the Second World War  In 1851 the Fort de Bic√™tre was a prison for plotters in a coup d'√©tat against Napoleon III. Several casemates were transformed into jails to hold prisoners before execution or deportation. During the Franco- Prussian War, the Fort de Bic√™tre and the other southern Paris forts were shelled by the Prussians. In early 1871 the French government capitulated and the Prussians occupied the fortifications of Paris. Bic√™tre was occupied by the Prussian 6th Corps from 29 January to 20 March 1871. As the Prussians began to withdraw in March, the Paris Commune uprising took place, occupying several southern forts including Bic√™tre. After bloody attacks by French government forces, the communards left the fort during the night of 24‚Äì25 May. In 1914 the fort was again manned by naval personnel. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the fort, a strategic point on the road to Fontainebleau. The Germans built three concrete blockhouses, a subterranean hospital and a water reservoir. The hospital totaled in area under of earth and of concrete. The facility also sheltered a command port. The reservoir was used in the 1960s as a swimming pool.  After the Second World War  From 1946, the fort was transformed into a military radio communications facility manned by the 1st Battalion of the 8th Transmissions Regiment. From 1949 the Munitions Service (ERGM) moved to Bic√™tre from Versailles and the Etablissement R√©gional du Mat√©riel des Transmissions was moved there from 1967. From 1968 the Etablissement annexe du Mat√©riel des Transmissions (EAMT) became the Centre Sp√©cialis√© des Transmissions Nord (CST Nord). In 1979 the fort acquired the Direction des Transmissions d‚ÄôInfrastructure/Administration Centrale DTI/AC). In 1983 the Centre de Contr√¥le des Fr√©quences (CCF/Nord) moved to Bic√™tre from Mont Val√©rien. In 1991 the Centre National de Soutien des Transmissions arrived at the fort, becoming the Centre de Soutien Sp√©cialis√© des Transmissions 2 (CSST2). In 1992 the Direction Centrale des Transmissions (DCT/DCTSI/DCTEI) arrived. In 1994 CSST2 amalgamated with CSST1 in Suresnes and CSST3 in Toulouse to become the Centre National de Soutien Sp√©cialis√© des Transmissions (CNSST). In 1996 the Centre d‚Äô√âtudes et de R√©alisation des Syst√®mes d‚ÄôInformation de l‚ÄôArm√©e de Terre, Bureau Architecture √âtudes (CERSIAT/BAE) was created to manage Army information technology. In 1997 the Syst√®me d‚ÄôInformation des Formations de l‚ÄôArm√©e de Terre (SIFAT) appeared. From July 2003 the units were reorganized into the Direction interarm√©es des r√©seaux d'infrastructure et des syst√®mes d'information (DIRISI) under the Ministry of Defense.  Public access  Since it is still used by the Ministry of Defense, the fort is closed to the public. However, tours are organized for European Heritage Days in September.

Established in 1926, ACI's goal is to advance public understanding of the safety and benefits of cleaning products, and protect the ability of its members to formulate products that best meet consumer needs. ACI develops and shares information about industry products with the technical community, policy makers, childcare and health professionals, educators, media and consumers. ACI includes over 100 manufacturers who make approximately 90% of all cleaning products produced in the United States, at the household, industrial, and institutional level. (The cleaning products industry is a $30 billion a year industry in the U.S.) In addition to companies that manufacture soaps and detergents directly, the association also includes producers of oleochemical products and other chemicals used in producing cleaning products, as well as companies that produce packaging and labeling for cleaning supplies. Like many trade associations, it acts as the industry's liaison with academia, the government, and the general public. In recent years, a good deal of the ACI's activities have focused on issues about which the government and the general public are concerned and the environmental impact of soaps and detergents. These concerns about human safety and environmental concerns lead the ACI to be in frequent contact with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Food and Drug Administration.

Ashcroft could not be personally sued for his involvement in the detention of a U.S. citizen in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States..  Background  The plaintiff, Abdullah al-Kidd (born Lavoni T. Kidd in Wichita, Kansas), was an American citizen and a prominent football player at the University of Idaho. While at college, Kidd converted to Islam and adopted the name Abdullah al-Kidd. Al-Kidd was arrested by federal agents in 2003 at Dulles International Airport. He was travelling to Saudi Arabia to attend school. He was held for two weeks under the federal material-witness statute. and controlled by supervised release for 13 months because he was to testify in the trial of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen. The latter was tried and acquitted on charges of supporting terrorist organizations. At the time of al-Kidd's arrest, the FBI Director Robert S. Mueller told Congress that it was one of the FBI's \\"success\\" stories. Al-Kidd was never charged or called as a witness, and he was ultimately released. Al-Kidd filed suit against John Ashcroft, who was U.S. Attorney General from 2001 to 2005. Al-Kidd alleges that he was denied access to a lawyer, shackled, and strip-searched. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented al-Kidd, claim that he is one of 70 Muslim men who were similarly treated. The federal government said that Ashcroft has absolute immunity from such civil suits because he was acting within the scope of his duties as US Attorney General. In the alternative, Ashcroft has qualified immunity that prevents such suits unless the official violated a right that was clearly established at the time of the violation. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that Ashcroft could personally be sued and held responsible for al-Kidd's wrongful detention. On October 18, 2010, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear Ashcroft's appeal of the Ninth Circuit's ruling.  Opinion of the Court  On May 31, 2011, the Supreme Court, in an 8‚Äì0 ruling, stated that al-Kidd's lawyers had not met the high burden of proof needed to show that Attorney General Ashcroft could be personally sued, that he was directly involved or had explicit knowledge of the events (suggesting the matter was handled mostly by distant subordinates). The ACLU had sued him personally because it is very hard to sue a senior agent of the government in his or her official capacity (unless an individual commits a felony or other serious crime, in which case an elected official may be impeached) because American government bodies enjoy immunity from being sued. In the majority opinion written by Justice Scalia, the court ruled that \\"Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions. When properly applied, it protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. Ashcroft deserves neither label\\" (internal citation omitted). Justice Kagan did not participate in the case as she had previously worked on the government's preparation of its case while serving in the Obama administration.

As well as giving a clean look to the engine, with the pushrod passages part of the cylinder block casting, unit construction reduced the number of places oil could leak from. A range of A65 Star twins was produced between 1962 and 1972. Development The decision by Lucas in the late 1950s to switch production of motorcycle electrical components (from magneto/dynamo systems to alternators/coil systems) forced British motorcycle manufacturers to completely redesign their engines. Triumph and BSA took the opportunity to move from pre-unit and semi-unit construction to full unit construction, that is, with the engine and gearbox together in an integrated casting. At the same time, Bob Fearon, managing director and general manager of BSA, recognised the need for a new look that built on the best features of the A10s but would succeed in the potentially lucrative, but competitive, US market. Working with chief development engineer Bert Perrigo, he developed the unit construction Star twins. A range of these Star twins were produced between 1962 and 1972, and improved on the old pre-unit A7 and A10 series, being lighter and easier to manufacture, with more up to date styling. Not enough time was spent on testing and development as BSA were struggling to remain competitive with Triumph models and the emerging Japanese motorcycles. Large side panels were fitted to cover the space behind the engine but they contributed to a dated look. This was reinforced by engine vibration, but acceleration was good to a top speed of . BSA Spitfire Twelve volt electrics were introduced in 1966 and the top of the range BSA Spitfire with a claimed top speed of . In 1967 BSA won a special Queens Award to Industry and by 1969 80% of the BSA factory production was going to America. In the US the 650 Star twins were selling well with styling changes including high rise handlebars and more streamlined fuel tanks. In 1970 a new 'oil in frame' design was adopted but this proved unpopular with shorter riders, as it increased the seat height. This was sorted out by 1972 but by then BSA were facing serious financial problems and stopped production of the outdated 650 Star twin.

The church sits next to a farmhouse directly under the wooded heights of Bubb Down. It is a single-celled building. The porch has the date \\"1636\\" inscribed, reflecting the fact that the church was rebuilt to some extent in the seventeenth century when a bell turret was also installed. However, John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner in their Buildings of England volume describe it as \\"Perp, with Henry VIII side windows and a three- light E window with panel tracery,\\" and also refer to the \\"delightfully naive bell-turret, round, with a cap on four stumpy columns and a big grotesque face.\\" Inside, the church is very plainly furnished.

Background  The city, which is now in modern-day Greece, was in 904 A.D. a part of the Byzantine Empire, and was considered the greatest city in the empire, second to only Constantinople. Following the weakening of centralized power in the Abbasid Caliphate due to the Fourth Fitna and the Anarchy at Samarra, many areas of the vast Abbasid Caliphate began to breakaway from the Caliph's control and while still paying religious lip service, acted independently on military and state matters. The attention of these largely autonomous Muslim dynasties was subsequently turned to the Mediterranean sea. In 860 the Muslim dynasties attempted to reassert their dominance over the Mediterranean seaway and built naval bases at Tripoli and Tarsus. In 898, the eunuch admiral Raghib, a former mawla of al-Muwaffaq. decisively defeated a Byzantine fleet and carried off 3,000 Byzantine sailors of the Kibyrrhaiotai as prisoners. This naval battle proved to be a turning point as it opened the Aegean up to raids by the Muslim fleets.  The battle and sack  A Muslim fleet of 54 ships, led by the renegade Leo of Tripoli, who was a recent convert to Islam, set sail from Syria with the imperial capital of Constantinople as its initial target. The Muslims were deterred from attacking Constantinople, and instead turned to Thessalonica, totally surprising the Byzantines, whose navy was unable to react in time. An old tradition recounted by John Kaminiates tells that the part of Thessalonica's wall that faces seaward was low, and totally unequipped to deal with any military threat. On that side the city was for many years completely unwalled, and it was only when the Persian king Xerxes had caused panic, by campaigning against Greece that the then ruler of the city had a hastily improvised fortification erected there. From then to the time of the Muslim sack of the city, this fortification had remained the same, and unimproved, as it was never supposed that it would enter into anyone's head to inflict damage from that quarter. Word came from the Byzantine Emperor of the planned attack by the Abbasids. When word of this reached Thessalonica's citizens, panic gripped the city. The name of the Emperor's messenger was Petronas, who held the rank of protospatharios. Petronas advised the Thessalonicans not to concentrate their efforts on repairs of the walls. John Kaminiates relates that Petronas devised an alternative strategy. Knowing that work on the walls would be superfluous not having the benefit of time, Petronas designed an underwater fence that would have protected the city by not letting ships near the walls. In 1777 a French abbot, Belley, in his study on the history and monuments of the city of Thessalonica, wrote: \\"There exist a great number of inscriptions, although a multitude of them were thrown into the sea, in order to prevent the fleet of the Saracens from landing at the city, which they sacked at the beginning of the tenth century.\\" Which corroborates Kaminiates' account. However, before the fence could be completed, along came yet another envoy from the emperor to take over responsibility for the welfare of the city and to expedite the recall of Petronas. This was Leo Chitzilakes who had been appointed Strategos of the region and put in charge of military operations. He decided to call a temporary halt to the work on the underwater fence and to have the building up of the wall completed. Leo VI sent yet again another Strategos named Niketas to replace Leo Chitzilakes to take command of the city. Despite a fearful reputation as a military commander, he was only able to marginally improve the city's chances for defense. Pleas for help to the outlying lands and vassals were largely ignored, while repair work on the wall would prove to be insufficient. The Abbasid raiders appeared and after a short siege lasting less than four days, the attackers were able to storm the seaward walls, overcome the Thessalonians' resistance, and take the city on 29 July.  Aftermath  The sacking continued for a full week before the raiders departed for their bases in the Levant, having freed 4,000 Muslim prisoners while capturing 60 ships,Faith and sword: a short history of Christian-Muslim conflict By Alan G. Jamieson, pg.32 gaining a large amount of loot and 22,000 captives, mostly young people, and destroying 60 Byzantine ships in the process.cf. the account of John Kaminiates A contemporaneous account by Al- Tabari stated that there were 5,000 Byzantines killed during the bloodbath and each Arab sailor was given 1,000 gold dinars as booty. St. Elias the Younger visited Thessalonica after the sack and described the city as one of sheer misery. The Abbasids withdrew after the siege and returned to Tripoli while the captives were sent to Tarsus. Most of the captives, including John Kaminiates, who chronicled the sack, were ransomed by the Empire and exchanged for Muslim captives. It is said that the Byzantine raid led by General Andronicus Ducas on the region of Germanicea in late 904 was launched to avenge the sack of Thessalonica. The Arabs of Tarsus were defeated and an exchange of prisoners transpired. Leo of Tripoli tried again to sail against Byzantium in 907 and 912 but was thwarted both times.  Problems With Primary Sources  There exist only two major primary sources for the Sack of Thessalonica. The first is the Greek John Kaminiates, and the second the Muslim historian al-Tabari. Despite there being short references to the event in other letters (mostly by clergymen) in the years following the sack, little historical evidence is found for this event. Combined with the fact that al- Tabari claims that Leo of Tripoli sacked Attaleia and not Thessalonica has led some scholars to claim that the Sack of Thessalonica never happened. Others claim that it is the product of a number of stories combined, while others argue over the historicity of the character of John Kaminiates. The major historical issues found in Kaminiates' account are as follows: \\\\- Conflicting information with al-Tabari who claims that Leo of Tripoli attacked Attaleia. \\\\- The writing style of John Kaminiates does not match the historical genre of his contemporaries. \\\\- Dates given by John Kaminiates do not match dates in Arab sources. \\\\- John Kaminiates provides very few historical facts that can be corroborated with other sources. \\\\- Very little sources by fellow Byzantines mention or reference John Kaminiates. In fact only one does so in passing. \\\\- The language that John Kaminiates uses is reminiscent of 15th century Greek, raises questions whether he was alive during the sack itself. Despite this, even scholars who cast the account of John Kaminiates into doubt, especially the dates he uses, most scholars agree that the sack indeed took place, and roughly around the dates provided by John Kaminiates.

Early life Originally hailing from Dublin, Paul spent the 1970s in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Ghana - an eclectic upbringing that would later influence his design work. His early working life spanned the music industry, as a singer in a band, metal work, shipbuilding, and the fashion industry.Theme Magazine November 1998, p. 39 Paul's career in design began shortly after the completion of his studies- a foundation course in fashion at The National College of Art and Design in Dublin, followed by a BA degree at Goldsmiths College, London.Design Matters Magazine, November 2000, p. 37-38 Daly's graduation year was shared by other noteworthy names in the design industry, including Gary Hume, Sarah Lucas and Fiona Rae.The Dubliner Magazine, January 1998, p. 22 In 1987, Paul relocated to Manhattan, working with many recognised artists and designers. It was here he founded his own business, designing and creating functional furniture such as tables, chairs and doors. Expanding projects Paul returned to London in 1988 and set up his own Design Studio and Workshop. The first club project embarked upon by Daly came in the form of Ri Ra, a Dublin venue, in 1993. The same period saw Paul work with U2 on their ‚ÄòZoo TV‚Äô tour.Chill Magazine January 2001, p. 23 In 1994, work commenced on The Elbow Room in Westbourne Grove - a venue that fused modern design concepts with the humble pool club. It was here that Paul first met fashion designer Ozwald Boateng. This chance encounter led to Paul designing Boateng's Saville Row showroom in 1995. Following this high-profile commission, Daly's volume of work increased dramatically: the following year saw Paul commence work on B Square, Saint, and U2's ‚ÄòPop Mart‚Äô tour.Homes and Houses, Sunday Independent 3 October 1999, 14 Since this period in the mid-90s, the focus of his studio has remained largely on design work for the bar and restaurant scene. London designs In 2003, Paul Daly opened his first bar, Zigfrid, in London's Hoxton Square, expanding it to incorporate a basement bar, Underbelly, in 2005. The success of these first forays into hospitality was closely followed by the opening of his third venue, Roadtrip, on nearby Old Street in 2008, which serves as the most recent project in his own venue portfolio. However, he has continued to take commissions for outside work, and in 2009 his design for Mayfair nightclub 'Vendome' won Best Designed Venue at the London Club and Bar Awards. A growing career Despite concentrating largely on the bar industry, Paul's success has continued to attract residential projects, with the biggest to date being the design of 13 high-end apartments in the Spencer Dock development in Dublin. He has also completed charitable commissions, and in 1999 turned his design skills towards the revamp of the homeless centre, ‚ÄòThe London Connection,‚Äô in Covent Garden.'The Elbow Room' FX Magazine February 2000, p11Evening Standard 31 March 1999, p. 29 His latest venue in Islington \\"Rattlesnake\\" failed and is now closed.

Starting from June 1960, he was member of Rome's municipal council for his party, Christian Democracy (DC). Within the DC, he was a member of the faction of Amintore Fanfani first, and Arnaldo Forlani later. He was elected mayor of Rome on 30 July 1969, being confirmed on 17 March 1972. In 1974 he formed a city council including only DC member, with indirect support by the councillors of the Italian Communist Party. In 1976 he resigned as mayor to participate in the 1976 general elections. He was elected in the Chamber of Deputies, being confirmed until 1992, when he was not re-elected. Darida served as Undersecretary at the Ministry of the Interior from 1976 to 1980, and, from 1980 to 1987,he served as Minister for the Parliamentary Relations, as Minister of Post and Telecommunications, as Minister of Public Function, as Minister of Justice and as Minister of State Holdings. During the Tangentopoli corruption scandal in the early 1990s, he was accused of bribery and imprisoned for a short period in San Vittore Prison. Later he was acquitted of all accusations and obtained from the Ministry of the Treasury a compensation of ‚Ç§ 100 million. In 2006 Darida participated with Publio Fiori in the constitution of a new political movement of Christian inspiration, the Christian Democratic Refoundation, of which he was appointed President of the National Council. In 2012 Darida accepted the invitation of several former Christian Democrat national councilors in office in 1993 and convened the National Council of Christian Democracy, after the Court of Cassation acknowledged that this party had never been dissolved, since the National Council that sanctioned the birth of the Italian People's Party in 1994 also didn't have the power to deliberate dissolution of the DC. On 30 March 2012 Darida proceeded, together with 48 other members, the self-convocation of the DC National Council, electing the new National Directorate. Gianni Fontana was appointed secretary of the reborn Christian Democracy, Silvio Lega was appointed president of the National Council, while Clelio Darida was appointed honorary president of the party. A few months after having contributed personally to the reconvening of the 1993 DC National Council, Darida abandoned the Christian Democracy led by Fontana to join the Christian Democracy led by Angelo Sandri, of which he became honorary president.

Biography Sears was born to a wealthy Yankee family in Boston in 1863. Her parents were Knyvet Winthrop Sears and Mary Crowninshield (Peabody) Sears. Sears was educated at private schools in Boston and by tutors in Europe. She authored several historical works as well as poetry, romantic works and popular songs for World War I.Cynthia H. Barton, History's Daughter: The Life of Clara Endicott Sears Founder of Fruitlands Museums (CLB Publications, 1988) () In 1910 Sears purchased a summer estate in Harvard, Massachusetts, which included the farmhouse that was part of a failed Transcendentalist community known as the Fruitlands or consociate family. After restoring the house, and collecting numerous materials, Sears opened the building as the Fruitlands Museum in 1914. Her research about the experiment brought her into contact with the last of the Harvard Shakers. When the Shaker community in Harvard closed in 1918, it was purchased by Fiske Warren a proponent for a single tax enclave. Sears bought the first building built by the Harvard Shakers, a 1794 office building from the Harvard Shaker Village from Warren and moved it to her property; it opened in 1922. Sears also worked with Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University in acquiring a Native American collection to display at the museum. Sears transferred all the museum assets to Fruitlands and the Wayside Museums, Inc., in 1930. By this time the property included about 458 acres. Also during the 1930s, she collected early 19th-century primitive portraits and built a gallery to display them in 1939. She also collected Hudson River School paintings and other America folk art for the museum. Sears was awarded a gold medal by the National Society of New England Women in 1942. She was a member of the Colonial Dames of America, the New England Historic Genealogical Society, and Society of Mayflower Descendants. Clara Endicott Sears died in Boston in 1960.

This is the complete version of the 1996 story called \\"La fuerza de Sheccid\\" (Sheccid's Strength). Plot The story begins when Jose Carlos, a shy fifteen-year-old, realizes he has fallen in love for the first time with the new girl in his school. After school, a strange man arrives with Carlos's classmate, Mario, and lures him into his car. The man is a porn producer, and he tries to convince Carlos to get his classmate Ariadne to make porn with them. Finally Carlos escapes with the help of Ariadne, who is a friend of the new girl. Carlos tells his parents to go to the police, but they are unable to locate the man, who abducted Mario. One day he decides to talk with the new girl, Sheccid (her real name is Justiniana Deghemteri, but Carlos changes it for the name of an Arabic princess). He confesses his love, but things go wrong when Ariadne recognizes him and tells Sheccid he is related to the pervert who tried to abduct her. Carlos does not give up and, moved by the love he feels, he overcomes the fears he has. At first he begins writing, like his grandparent, realizing he is good at it. His new journal is filled with all his thoughts and poems that he writes for Sheccid. As time goes by, Carlos realizes he is changing. First he begins giving speeches that impress his teachers and classmates, specially the class leader, Beatriz. Of course the speeches also impress Sheccid, who is good at giving speeches too. Ariadne realizes he is a good guy and he is not a pervert, so she begins a friendship with Carlos. They become good friends and Ariadne realizes he is in love with her friend. Suddenly a new boy who goes to the same school begins to get along with Sheccid. After some time he becomes her boyfriend. Carlos dislikes the new boy, because he knows that the guy is not truly in love with Sheccid. The new guy is bigger, stronger and more popular; however, Carlos is not afraid. One day the new guy punches Sheccid and Carlos stands up for her. Sheccid likes the actions of Carlos but her boyfriend organizes a big fight between Carlos's friends and his own friends. Almost all his classmates help Carlos; however, the other guys are gang members, carrying blades and chains to the fight. The fight is unfair, but with the help of teachers, the police arrive to calm the brawl. After that, Sheccid decides to break up with her boyfriend. Everything seems to be fine until Sheccid begins to skip school. At first Carlos does not give this much importance; however, she continues to miss class. He decides to face the problem and talks with her; she says he should just forget about her, and then she kisses him. (The following part was divided and published as ‚ÄúEl secreto de Sheccid‚Äù, Sheccid‚Äôs secret). Desperate, Carlos asks Ariadne for help. She agrees, and then he learns that her family is going to move to another the city, apparently because the mother is ill and the father is having an affair. Before the brawl, he gave her his journal but Sheccid does not say anything else and asks him to forget her. He falls into depression because Sheccid has left him, and does not seem to feel the same way Carlos feels for her. Ariadne tells him to go to her house, to see the \\"real\\" Sheccid. After the brawl, he goes to Sheccid's house where he discovers that Sheccid has a brain tumor, and the family is leaving the city to get her special medical attention, the day after she gets out of the hospital from a very dangerous and risky surgery: the father will leave with Sheccid first, followed later by Sheccid's mom and brother. The day of the surgery, he calls Ariadne (who knows everything), only to learn that Sheccid died from complications. Ariadne gives him a letter that Sheccid left for him. In the letter, she explains him that she loved him until the last day of her life. She tells him that there were two options for her: to die during surgery, or survive and then leave to receive attention in another city. Either way, they could not be together. She confesses him she had turned him down so he would not get hurt, whatever the outcome. He then writes in his journal a poem for Sheccid, telling that she will always be a part of him, and he will always remember her the way he knew her. This is the end of Carlos's first love, but not the end of the story. Carlos wrote \\"Sheccid's Secret\\" as a means to overcome the events that really happened. After Ariadne tells him to go see Sheccid at her house, he walks into a party. There, he sees Sheccid's mom sitting in a chair in a catatonic state. He gets introduced to Sheccid's father, who is at the party with another woman; the rumors about the problems in Sheccid's family were true. When he sees Sheccid, she is drinking, smoking and in a drug induced state, doing a dance for some men. He then faces the painful truth: he loved Justiniana because he thought of her as the embodiment of Sheccid, his ideal of the perfect woman. But Justiniana was not Sheccid. Facing this fact, he leaves the party. Heartbroken, and about to go insane, he locks himself up in his room and writes a different ending to his story; in his journal he kills Sheccid to free not only the love he felt for her, but to free himself from the pain he felt when he realized he was in love with an illusion. It is at this point that we find out that Mario, the classmate abducted by the pervert, was found alive in a car accident. The book ends with Carlos realizing that, by the love he felt, he changed for good; love made him a stronger, better person, and by keeping the innocence of his lost love, he could remain like that. Sheccid In the book the main character calls the new girl in his school \\"Sheccid\\". The name Sheccid comes from a story told by his grandfather. In the story a young man is sent to prison unfairly; in the jail the man began to fill his heart and mind with despair and revenge. Then Sheccid, the king's daughter, appears and her beauty and kindness make the young man regain a good-hearted nature. Finally the princess helps him escape from jail; however, the young man never told her about his feelings and the princess married another man. The moral of the story is that true love makes people grow in every way of their lives.

From the artist‚Äôs CV, received from the Indigenous Art Centre David studied studio art and art education at Concordia University in Montreal. The Oka crisis In 1990, Joe David's life and career moved in an unexpected direction as a result of the Oka crisis, a 78-day armed stand-off between the Kanehsatake Mohawks and the Canadian army that began during the summer of that year. The Oka Crisis began as a non-violent occupation of the Pines, a stand of hundred-year-old trees located in Kanehsatake and planted by the ancestors of the Mohawks who live there now. The protesters erected a barricade to protest a golf course expansion and the construction of a parking lot over the cemetery where the ancestors of the Kanehsatake Mohawks are buried. The land dispute exploded into armed conflict on 11 July 1990 when the Mohawk protesters‚Äô barricade was attacked by the Quebec provincial police, the S√ªret√© du Quebec (SQ). During the attack, SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay was killed.

On 26 September, the Mohawks (including Joe David) who had remained behind the barricade in Kanehsatake dismantled their guns and threw them in a fire. They burned tobacco and then walked out of the Pines holding their ceremonial masks. Many were detained by the Canadian Forces and arrested by the SQ.Oka Crisis, CBC and Historica, Peace and Conflict Historica, Peace and Conflict Joe David was among those who were charged as a result of the Oka Crisis.

Butler persuaded Andrew Carnegie to fund the construction of Carnegie Lake near Princeton University, supervised the construction of the Carnegie Mansion, designed an astronomy hall, and painted a solar eclipse for the U.S. Naval Observatory. Biography=Science, law and art Butler was born in New York City. He was the son of William Allen Butler, a lawyer and satirist. His early artistic training with William Shannon was complemented by visits to the National Academy of Design, where his parents were both fellows, and the studio of his uncle, William Stanley Haseltine. Butler attended Princeton University and obtained a degree in Science in 1876 and he was invited to stay on for a year as an assistant professor of physics. From 1878 to 1879 he was doing technical illustrations in New York where he knew Thomas Edison. In 1881 he graduated from Columbia University where he had studied law. Whilst he was at Princeton he was an active member of the rowing team despite there being poor facilities. Butler practiced patent law until 1884 when he decided to concentrate entirely on painting. Art and leadership Butler reapplied himself studying under Frederic Edwin Church, who was wintering in Mexico for his health, in January 1884 before returning to study with J. Carroll Beckwith and George de Forest Brush at the Art Students League in New York. In 1885, he went to France for two years and lived in Paris, a member of the artistic American colony in Paris, and Concarneau.http://www.concarneau- peintres.fr/etranger/americains/butler.htm In 1889 Butler was able to find the capital to build the Fine Arts building at 215 West 57th Avenue. This building was to be the home of the Art Students League, the Society of American Artists, the Architectural League of New York and the newly formed American Fine Arts Society which Butler led for its first 17 years. Whilst raising these funds he first met Andrew Carnegie who employed him for ten years as president of the Carnegie Music Hall Company allowing him time off each day to paint. Butler married his wife Virginia Hays in 1890. By 1899 he was a National Academician of the National Academy of Design and a member of the Architectural League and the Society of American Artists. Carnegie Lake Art and Carnegie Lake In 1902 he was invited to join the Society of Artists and he was asked to make another portrait of the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Whilst Carnegie was sitting for the portrait, the problem of finding places to row at Princeton was discussed. Carnegie noted that Scottish lochs were created by just constraining the flow of water. Butler and the rowing team had just such a scheme in mind to create an artificial lake. With Carnegie's permission, Butler contacted a building firm in his home town and obtained an estimate of US$118,000 to construct a lake. Lake Carnegie and the purchase of hundreds of acres of land resulted from this meeting. It was while employed by Carnegie that Butler supervised the construction of Carnegie's mansion on Fifth Avenue, which was designed by Babb, Cook, & Willard and is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, but he and Carnegie differed and Butler left his employ in 1905. From 1905 until 1907 he was in California and again in the early 1920s when he was living at Pasadena and Santa Barbara. He may therefore have missed the opening of the lake in 1906 that was three and a half miles long and eight hundred feet wide. It was reported that President Wilson tried to later persuade Carnegie to give funds to Princeton but he was told that he had already given a lake. Wilson is reputed to have said, \\"We needed bread and you gave us cake.\\" 1918 Solar eclipse painting Solar eclipse and art In 1918, Butler's association with Carnegie led to him being invited to witness and record the 1918 Solar eclipse that was observed from Baker City in Oregon. The expedition was organized by the U.S. Naval Observatory and included Samuel Alfred Mitchell as its expert on eclipses. Butler noted later that he used a system of taking notes of the colors using skills he had learned for transient effects. Usually a sitting for a portrait took two hours but an eclipse would take just over 112 seconds. It has been noted that he had painted Carnegie thirteen timesAnother source says 17 times and like the eclipse he could never keep still to allow Butler to make considered notes. His revived interest in physics led to his 1923 book Painter and Space which coincided with his second visit to a solar eclipse. He also created pictures of planets that were as seen from one of their moons. His last known eclipse visit was in 1932. Butler is known particularly for paintings of seascapes and for his views of the eclipse of the sun, but he also painted people and landscapes. Butler also designed an Astronomy Hall for the American Museum of Natural History. Butler's paintings of solar eclipses were on display for many years at the Hayden Planetarium at that museum. Butler died in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1934 near the lake that he had organized for their rowing team. His work can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, American Museum of Natural History and of course Carnegie Lake.

The film was written and directed by Michael Morrissey and stars Caleb Steinmeyer, Zulay Henao, Bill Sage, Tracy Middendorf, Daniel Stewart Sherman, Chuck Cooper, and James Russo.  Plot  A young boy named Sean Donovan lives with his mother and abusive alcoholic father. A carjacker attacks his family one night, which results in his mother's murder. Afterward, his father Terry moves them to a nicer neighborhood. Ten years later, Sean is an excellent student but is antisocial and distant from his peers. He sees abuse in everyday arguments among those around him. He trains in self-defense skills and begins to carry a weapon at night. During an attempted mugging, he kills a man. An eyewitness statement draws the interest of Teresa Ames, who has recently been promoted to the NYPD homicide division. She takes an interest in Sean, who frequents the police station as he searches for the information on his mother's murderer. Teresa befriends him and learns about his life, including his interest in a toxin named Tricelaron. He insists it was part of his research for a chemistry paper. She also finds that he speaks fluent Chinese after he angrily berates rude staff in a Chinese restaurant. Later on, Sean defends a young woman who is being abused by her pimp. He fights with the pimp before shooting and killing him. While riding the train, Sean encounters an unkempt man under the influence who is verbally threatening a Chinese family and other passengers of the train. In Chinese, Sean tells the boy to tell his family to leave the car. He puts on black face paint and brutally beats the man with brass knuckles. Teresa and her partner, who happen to be on the train, investigate, but Sean gets away without being identified. Teresa learns that the perpetrator spoke fluent Chinese and suspects Sean. Despite her supervisor's warning not to investigate Sean, she persists. Finally, the now- retired supervisor tells Teresa that the young Sean was able to clearly identify his mother's murderer from a photo book, but his father Terry convinced him to change his story. The murderer is identified as Larry Childs, a contract killer, whom Teresa arrested six months ago, but has just managed to get a two-year sentence, and entry into the witness protection program through a plea bargain. As Sean walks down the street, he sees parents disciplining their children, but they are inflated in his mind to abusive violence. During a school party, Sean has a violent flashback of his mother's murder, and recalls hearing the killer call his father by his old boxing nickname. Enraged by the memory, he savagely beats a fellow student who has been harassing a female friend. Teresa, while investigating Sean, finds a picture at his house of Terry and the murderer Larry together and realizes that they knew each other before the attack. Sean believes that Terry staged the attack to obtain his mother's life insurance. Sean confronts his father, but Terry adamantly denies he killed his own wife. Convinced of his father's guilt, Sean shoots and kills Terry. Teresa finds Sean, but he says someone broke into their home and killed his father. Teresa sees the murder weapon and disposes of it. Sometime later, Sean sends a letter to Larry, who is currently serving his two-year sentence. In the letter Sean expresses his forgiveness to Larry but pleads with him to reveal the truth of his mother's murder: was his father involved? He offers a simple way to reply and includes an self- addressed, empty envelope, a red stamp, and a black stamp. He asks Larry to use the black stamp if his father is guilty or the red stamp if his father is innocent. Larry licks the stamp and after handing it to a guard, falls to the floor of his jail cell, unable to breathe. Sean has laced the stamp glue with Tricelaron and Larry dies. When Sean receives the letter, he stares at the red stamp it bears, indicating that his father was in fact innocent of the murder and Sean had killed him for nothing.  Cast  * Caleb Steinmeyer as Sean Donovan * Zulay Henao as Teresa Ames * James Russo as Larry Childs * Bill Sage as Terry Donovan * Tracy Middendorf as Mary Donovan * Chuck Cooper as Bill Baldwin  Production  Cinematographer Chris LaVasseur used a RED One camera to shoot the film. He used the digital intermediate process to tweak the colors according to director Michael Morrissey's desires. Morrissey, who had never worked with a RED One camera before, was initially skeptical, as he found the colors to be too saturated. LaVasseur was able to demonstrate to him that this could be easily corrected. Filming took place in Canarsie, Brooklyn, New York.  Release  Boy Wonder premiered at the Rhode Island Film Festival. It was released on DVD in the United States on November 8, 2011.  Reception  Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 50% based on 6 reviews from critics; the average rating is 6.4/10. Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote, \\"Morrissey displays a flair for moody atmospherics as his protagonist wanders Gotham's streets and subways at night, but the film relies too heavily on cryptic flashbacks and deliberate gaps in the narrative to create suspense, revealing rather than fleshing out connective tissue.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter described it as an intriguing and smart exploration of vigilantism that could become a cult film. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated it 3.5/4 stars and wrote, \\"In a genre populated with formulas and dreck, Boy Wonder is an ambitious exception, well-made, drawing us in.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Despite its aura of rebellious cool, Boy Wonder is as frigid and empty as Sean‚Äôs vengeful heart.\\" J.

Velsius started his career as a highly respected professor of liberal arts in Leuven, Strasbourg, and Cologne. Later on he portrayed himself as a prophet, and promoted his own particular view of Christianity, outlined in a pamphlet \\"Christiani Hominis Norma\\" which he wrote in London. He came into conflict with civil and ecclesiastical authorities all over Europe, and spent his final years as a preacher and faith healer in his native Holland. While in Cologne Velsius was married to Beatrix van Steenhoven, and later on, in Groningen, to Grete Cassens. Life De mathematicarum disciplinarum vario usu dignitateque, 1544 After studying arts and medicine in Bologna, Velsius graduated as doctor medicinae in 1538 and settled down as physician in Antwerp, 1540/41. In 1541 he moved to Leuven, where he met Portuguese humanist Dami√£o de G√≥is, and maintained friendly relations with Vesalius. Even though Velsius did not have a university position he held public lectures in Greek, Latin, philosophy and mathematics. In 1544 he proposed a course on Trebizond's Dialectica. The authorities balked, and in the ensuing controversy they forced Velsius, whose theological purity was suspect, out of the university. In 1542 he had failed in his bid to succeed Nannius, and he moved to Strasbourg in 1544 at the recommendation of Bucer, after a short teaching stint at the Marburg Latin School and possibly in Basel. Strasbourg From Easter 1544-50 Velsius taught dialectic and Aristotelian ethics in the higher grades of the gymnasium in Strasbourg, as a co-worker of Johannes Sturm. On November 17, 1545 he received a canonicate at St. Thomas collegiate church, through the mediation of Bucer. Some time before October 17, 1548, he married Beatrix van Steenhoven. When Velsius got in trouble because he accepted the Interim and the resulting conflict with his Protestant colleagues, he moved to Cologne in the spring of 1550; he probably only gave up his Strasbourg canonicate in 1553. Cologne: prosecuted by the Inquisition Velsius matriculated at Cologne on June 3, 1550. The Council of Cologne wanted to build a Trilingual school following the example of the University of Leuven, and appointed Velsius professor of philosophy and Greek, in August 1550. Since Velsius was married, he could not obtain a university prebend, but was instead remunerated by the council. His compensation was increased in 1551 and 1552, and he was charged with teaching mathematics as well. Velsius and his colleague Jakob Leichius, who was instrumental in establishing the Gymnasium Tricoronatum, drafted guidelines for a curriculum of eight grades, similar to Sturm‚Äôs humanistic curriculum in Strasbourg. Velsius attended the meetings of the Anabaptists in the Bookbinder's Guildhall at the Pfaffengasse, where he met Anabaptist martyr Thomas von Imbroich.Neff, Christian. (1958).

Velsius‚Äô philosophical writings, in particular the work of Krisis led to suspicion of heresy. On October 29, 1554 Krisis was condemned by Cologne University, and Velsius‚Äô teaching license revoked (December 11, 1554, confirmed March 29, 1555), since he did not distance himself from his writing. Emperor Charles V, who had become involved at the instigation of the cathedral chapter, the clergy and the university, urged the council in vain to take action against Velsius, who on March 25, 1555 had published a defense, Epistola ad Ferdinandum. Only after Velsius attempted to give theological lectures at his home, and rejected the Eucharistic adoration and celibacy, did the magistrate banish him in April 1555. Velsius refused to leave, and went voluntarily in detention, from December 1555 to the end of March 1556. He asked his influential friend Viglius to support him, but Viglius declined to get involved. Greatly offended by this refusal, Velsius apparently accused his friend of Protestant leanings, and severed all connections with his former friend. Because of this precedent the council adopted in 1555 a comprehensive directive against all heretics. The Dominican Johannes Slotanus served as papal inquisitor for the Ecclesiastical province of Mainz, Cologne and Trier against Velsius and three other imprisoned people, whom he described as Anabaptists. The Protestant Princes intervened at the council on his behalf, in particular Christoph von Oldenburg. Since in December 1555 he had declared to adhere to the Augsburg Confession, Velsius was protected by the recently concluded Peace of Augsburg. On the night of 26 to 27 March 1556 he was taken by boat across the river and put ashore on the other side, in the Duchy of Berg. From there he made it to M√ºlheim, where he wrote Apologia, addressed to the Emperor Charles and King Ferdinand. Slotanus replied in 1557 with the Apologia JV Hagani Confutatio. In response Velsius wrote in September 1557 the Epistolae. 1558 followed Slotanus' Disputationes adversus haereticos liber unus. Frankfurt: disputation with Calvin Velsius arrived in Frankfurt on July 15, 1556, approached Robert Horne, pastor of the English Church, and informed him of the revelations on which he wished to conduct a public dispute. Hearing of the arrival of Calvin, who came to arbitrate conflicts within the French Refugee Church, he offered the latter to preside. He proposed to defend the free will against the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. The debate with Calvin, Johannes √† Lasco and Horne lasted two days; Velsius' argument boiled down to this: aut esse liberum arbitrium, aut Deum tyrannum esse (Either there is free will, or God is a tyrant). In a letter addressed to Melanchthon, dated September 17, 1556, Calvin commented as follows: > I have been dragged hither by the dissensions with which Satan has rent, for > nearly two years, the little French church established here, and reduced to > such extremities that it must have disappeared, unless some remedy had been > very promptly applied. Since I entered the town I have not had a moment‚Äôs > repose, and as if I had not had sufficient occupation in this affair, a > madman called Velsius, to whom you had written twice, involved us in new > fooleries. But we have devoted only two days to this importunity. I am > continually distracted up to this moment, in appeasing those dissentions > which, from the long lapse of time, have struck deep root. On April 15, 1557 Velsius was expelled by the Council of Frankfurt. Heidelberg: trouble with the Kurf√ºrst August 5, 1557 Velsius matriculated at Heidelberg, and obtained a license to give public lectures in philosophy. In June 1558 this license was revoked by the Senate of the University at the orders of Kurf√ºrst Ottheinrich because he spread theses that were against the Holy Scriptures. Velsius attacked the pastor of the Heiliggeistkirche, Johann Flinner, on his position on the Eucharist, sent him a series of theses on new birth and free will, and accused the pastor of being a false apostle and misleader of the prince and people. In November 1559 he was also disallowed to give private lectures, after intervention of Kurf√ºrst Friedrich III, and was expelled by the Senate of the University. Velsius shook the dust off his shoes, , , as he left. In 1560 Velsius was back in Frankfurt. He asked the council for permission to have a book printed he had written die Summa christlicher Lehre und Lebens (The Summary of Christian Doctrine and Life). The council referred his request to the Lutheran pastors, who on August 2, 1560 reported back that his book contained theses that were against orthodox doctrine. They also expressed concern that these doctrines could lead to unrest in the foreign churches in the city, as had happened in M√ºnster. On March 18, 1561 the council ordered Velsius to leave the city, since he had his book printed without permission. The innkeeper where he was boarding, Hansen Braun, was told to no longer allow him to stay in his house. In May 1561 Velsius was in Strasbourg. He wrote to Flinner (who had returned from Heidelberg) and the preachers, and to the council as well, submitting 20 propositions, probably the same ones as he announced in Heidelberg and in Frankfurt. These were not accepted, since they disagreed with the catechism then in use in Strasbourg. A month later, in June 1561, Velsius was in Basel. He was luckier there, at least he could count on Sebastian Castellio, with whom he had corresponded before, and advocates of tolerance such as Cellarius and Celio Secondo Curione. He submitted a summary to the Council of the University, who considered it on June 16. The council forwarded it to the Faculty of Theology, since it was outside their area of expertise. Cellarius proposed a number of theses for an academic disputation, but Velsius declined after the council had refused a public debate. On June 25 Velsius departed for Z√ºrich, where he arrived the next day. He wrote to the council, and Bullinger responded on behalf of the council, pointing out that his criticism didn't apply since it was directed at Luther and at the Roman Catholic Church. On July 4 Velsius had left town. On August 1 Velsius was back in Heidelberg, where he wrote a last time to Bonifacius Amerbach and to Johannes Sturm. He matriculated in Marburg at the end of August 1561, where he lectured at the medical school. However, he remained only a few months in Marburg. London: more religious turmoil In 1563, Velsius had crossed the Channel to England where he joined the Dutch Church in London. Again he sought controversy, this time with Nicolaus Carinaeus, the minister of the Dutch refugee church, who had died from the plague in September 1563. Carinaeus had explained his thoughts about regeneration through Christ. Velsius opposed him publicly developing at length his idea that the perfection of Adam could be reached on earth after inner rebirth had taken place in the individual. Velsius wrote a summary of his religion Christiani Hominis Norma (The Rule of a Christian Man), in which he explained his notion that through regeneration man could become God-in-man, like Christ. He sent copies of this pamphlet to the Bishop of London Edmund Grindal, to Secretary of State William Cecil, and to Queen Elizabeth. Justus Velsius' signature on his letter to Queen Elizabeth He also wrote a letter to the French Ambassador denouncing the vengeance of God on all who refused to receive his propositions. In his letter to the Queen, Velsius claimed to have confirmed his calling by performing miracles. The servant to the ambassador, Cosmus, fasted five or six days by Velsius' persuasion that after his abstinence he might receive illuminations a c≈ìlo. According to Grindal in the end he fell mad, so neither of those miracles stood the test of further investigation. Bishop Grindal wrote a rebuttal, showing that Velsius' teachings were against orthodox doctrine. Velsius was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission, consisting of Bishop Grindal, the Bishop of Winchester Robert Horne, and the Dean of St. Paul's Alexander Nowell, who had a frank discussion with him, and charged him in the Queen's name to leave the kingdom. This he complained of in very rude words to the Queen, and predicted the death of the bishop of Winchester and other important public figures. Imprisoned in Groningen Velsius returned to his native Holland, in April 1566 he was Groningen. In 1574 he was in prison there, presumably because of religious reasons. The authorities felt sorry for him, because he was an elderly gentleman, and apparently depressed. They therefore proposed to release him, also because of the hardship imprisonment caused him and his wife Grete Cassens, as they had to provide for his own cost of living. The proposal was considered by the Stadtholder de Robles, who had a conversation with Velsius, and referred it to the bishop, who charged the dean of the cathedral to look into it. On August 24, 1574 the bishop endorsed Velsius' release. However, Velsius refused to leave prison, because he only wanted to be released by God's grace, not by human intervention. This unusual situation lasted until May 1575, when de Robles required the jail to be vacated, since the adjacent castle had to be strengthened and readied for the garrison. Faith healer in Holland In April 1570 he was again in Cologne and then traveled through the Netherlands as a Protestant preacher. In 1578, 1580 and 1581 he was in Leiden. Place and year of death are unknown. Work Velsius published the Greek text of Proclus's De Motu (On Motion), along with a Latin translation. Theology Justus Velsius is interesting because his life reflects so well the unsettled intellectual conditions of 16th-century Europe. His theological profile in the religious landscape is not clearly defined: first, he did not agree with Luther‚Äôs dogma of \\"sola fide\\" and instead held on to the free will of man; on the other hand, he supported the Lutheran Eucharist and rejected transubstantiation. Also, Velsius cannot be identified as Anabaptist, and is distinct from Spiritualism. What sets Velsius apart is that he taught justification by new birth, not by forgiveness of sins. He thought of himself as a messenger of God, sent to warn people for eternal damnation, and claimed to be able to confirm his teachings by miracles. It has been suggested that Velsius may have known Servetus, since both were close to Vesalius. Velsius' position about predestination is reminiscent of Servetus', and it is noteworthy that the Calvin-Velsius disputation on this subject took place less than three years after Servetus was executed outside Geneva. Rembert suggests that Velsius may have known Flemish Anabaptist religious reformer Johann Campanus, or at the very least that they were aware of each other's work. Velsius' teachings appear to be related to those of the Family of Love. Velsius was a contemporary of Hendrik Niclaes, the founder of the Family of Love, and it seems likely that they may have known each other.

In this process, the motif is developed into an entire musical structure by using sequences, intervallic changes or simple repetitions. As a principle it exposes a thematic capus (German: Themenkopf) and from there on opens itself to a (mostly) counterpuntal structure, while the reentry of same Themenkopf (often transposed) diverts from the fact, that there is no actual closing formula in the Fortspinnungsthema. Thus the Forspinnungsprinzip counters the principle of the German Periode, common to the Wiener Klassik sonata, which is metrically finite (albeit not closing, as such): Everything in the Periode points to a metrically defined point, where its 'end', its 'right border' is to expect. This pointing structure is missing, i. e. carefully averted in the Fortspinnung. Thus the Gestalt of the Fortspinnungsthema has a 'rag margin', while the Periode ends more predictably. It is also possible to use the fortspinnung form term that stands for a structure with three parts: *Vordersatz: The antecedent or exposition of the motif. *Fortspinnung: The fortspinnung itself where the motif is developed. *Epilog: The epilogue or cadence section. In Baroque music, melodies and their lyrics were prose. Rather than paired lines they consist of rhetorical sentences or paragraphs consisting of an opening gesture, an amplification (often featuring sequence), and a close (featuring a cadence); in German Vordersatz-Fortspinnung-Epilog.Kelly, Thomas Forest (2011). Early Music: A Very Short Introduction, p. 53. . For example: When I was a child, [opening gesture] I spake as a child, [amplification...] I understood as a child, [...] I thought as a child; [...] But when I became a man, I put away childish things. [close] ‚Äî1 Corinthians 13  Examples  The use of this process of development and musical structure is focused mainly in the Baroque period. Here is an example of the fortspinnung process in the first section of the Johann Sebastian Bach Invention No. 4 in D minor (BWV 775): Bach's Invention 4 (section). Even though it is a Baroque technique, it is also possible to find this process in scores from other composers in different periods, such as Johannes Brahms in the Romantic period: Brahms' Intermezzo 4, Op. 76 (section)  References  Category:Musical form Category:Motifs (music) ","title":"Fortspinnung"},{"id":"29263018","title":"Good Friend and a Glass of Wine"},{"id":"29263053","text":"Phyllonorycter graecus is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

Description A small, scrambling, deciduous tree reaching a height of about 3m, its purple, star-shaped flowers appear in summer, followed by distinctive four-lobed berries (from where it gets its common names \\"crossberry\\" and \\"four-corner\\"). These shiny reddish-brown fruits remain on the tree for long periods and are favoured by fruit-eating birds. The simple leaves are shiny, deep green and sometimes slightly hairy. Natural distribution The natural range of this plant extends from Cape Town in the south, across South Africa, to Mozambique in the north and inland as far as Zimbabwe. Across this region, it can be found in a variety of habitats, from arid karoo to evergreen afro-montane forest and on wooded grasslands. Growing Grewia occidentalis This decorative garden plant tolerates both light frost and drought. It also grows in both full sun or shade. The root system is not aggressive and can therefore be planted near buildings and paving, and it is very good at attracting butterflies and birds to the garden. The crossberry is best propagated from seed, although even then it can be erratic, as usually the seed needs to pass through the gut of a monkey before germination commences. The berries are eaten locally, either fresh and raw, fermented with traditional beer, or used with goats milk to make berry yoghurt.

Early life and criminal career Crowe was born on a farm outside Davenport, Iowa, and had 11 siblings. He was of Irish descent. Soon after he turned 13 his mother died, and Crowe moved to South Omaha, Nebraska, a new town centered on a growing meat packing industry. Along with a partner named Pat Cavanaugh, Crowe opened a butcher shop in the area at age 17. Soon after, his shop was closed by the large operation owned by Edward Cudahy. He was hired by the Cudahy Meatpacking Plant shortly thereafter. Cudahy fired Crowe after he was caught stealing money from the operation.Galluzzo, J. (2005) When Hull Freezes Over: Historic Winter Tales from the Massachusetts Shore. The History Press. p. 92. Crowe held a variety of jobs and committed small crimes until the early 1890s. Using the alias Frank Roberts, Crowe perpetrated a variety of crimes. After being detained by police in a pawnbroker's shop in Chicago, Crowe got in a gunfight with police. He was arrested and sentenced to six years in the Joliet prison for the gunfight and the alleged attempted robbery of the pawnbroker's shop. However, he did not serve this entire sentence: Governor Fifer pardoned him after having only served 17 months. In 1894, a local newspaper was granted an interview with Crowe, whose crimes had brought him international notoriety. The newspaper painted a flattering portrait of Crowe: > Pacing back and forth in a real cell at the central police station when > alone and readily entering in conversation with all who came to see him, > yesterday, was Patrick Thomas Crowe, who in the past has become so notorious > as a crook that his fame extends to two continents.

During the interview, he told the reporter that he had been married at 18 and had three children, all of whom had died young. In 1897, Crowe, again as Roberts, was sent to trial in Denver, Colorado, for burglary and larceny of a jewelry store. However, he jumped bond and was never tried.The Jewelers' Circular and Horological Review. Volume 34. May 19, 1897. p 16. Crowe resurfaced in South Omaha around 1900 with his old comrade Pat Cavanaugh. That winter they kidnapped Edward Cudahy, Jr. After scoring the first successful ransom for a kidnapping in the United States, Crowe disappeared, resurfacing a number of times(December 12, 1904) \\"Elusive Suspect Escapes from Federal Detectives\\".

That year, he walked down the streets of Butte, Montana, asking to be arrested for the kidnapping. In February 1906, despite the prosecution's 40 witnesses, a firsthand account of a confession to a priest, and no testimony by his defense, Crowe was acquitted by a jury. After the kidnapping After his acquittal, Crowe was not implicated in any more major crimes, but was arrested for panhandling in New York. He wrote two autobiographies, in both of which he admitted his responsibility for Cudahy, Jr.'s kidnapping.

Caucasus Military District is shown in purple at the left. The Caucasus Military District (, Kavkazskiy voenniy okrug) was a military formation of the Imperial Russian Army. It was created in 1865 as the successor to the Caucasus Army, and was dissolved in 1917. History The Caucus Military District was created as part of the military reforms of the minister Dmitry Milyutin. During the entire existence of the District, the District Commander in Chief was also supreme civil authority in the Caucasus and Ataman of Caucasian troops. In 1865 - 1881 and again in 1905 - 1917, the District Commander in Chief was also His Majesty's Viceroy in the Caucasus. On the formation of the District, the Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolayevich (who had already been His Majesty's Viceroy in the Caucasus and Commander in Chief of the Caucasus Army since December 6, 1862) became its first Commander in Chief. On August 23, 1915 (during the First World War), the Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich was appointed to this post, a post he held until February 3, 1917. The Caucasus Army was formed in July 1914 from units of the Caucasus Military District. This army ceased to exist in April 1917 when it was reorganized by the new Russian Republic as the Caucasus Front, although this Front contained many of the same units and continued fighting in the same theater. This Front in turn dissolved and formally ceased to exist in March 1918. Area After a series of changes in 1866, 1868, 1878, 1881, 1883, 1898 and 1899, by 1914 the area of the District included seven provinces (Stavropol, Tiflis, Kutaisi, Elisavetpol, Baku, Erevan and the Black Sea) and five regions (Kuban, Terek, Dagestan, Kars and Batumi) - a total of 12 administrative divisions, of which three were in the north and nine in the Caucasus, these nine forming the Caucasian Viceroyality of which the Commander in Chief of the district was viceroy.

Materials transported typically include ore, coal and overburden (also called variously spoils, waste, slack, culm,culture noted and terms listed: culm. and tilings; all meaning waste rock). It is little remembered, but the mix of heavy and bulky materials which had to be hauled into and out of mines gave rise to the first several generations of railways, at first made of wood rails, but eventually adding protective iron, steam locomotion by fixed engines and the earliest commercial steam locomotives, all in and around the works around mines. History=Mine rails Minecart shown in De Re Metallica (1556). The guide pin fits in a groove between two wooden planks. Wagonways (or tramways) were developed in Germany in the 1550s to facilitate the transport of ore tubs to and from mines, using primitive wooden rails. Such an operation was illustrated in 1556 by Georgius Agricola of Germany (Image right).Georgius Agricola (trans Hoover), De re metallica (1913), p. 156 This used \\"Hund\\" carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the truck fitting into the gap between the planks, to keep it going the right way.The miners called the wagons Hund ‚Äî \\"dog\\" ‚Äî from the noise they made on the tracks. Such a transport system was used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s.Warren Allison, Samuel Murphy, and Richard Smith, 'An Early Railway in the German Mines of Caldbeck' in G. Boyes (ed.), Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008 (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), 52‚Äì69. An alternative explanation derives it from the Magyar hint√≥ ‚Äì a carriage. There are possible references to their use in central Europe in the 15th century.Lewis, Early wooden railways, 8-10. A funicular railway was made at Broseley in Shropshire, England at some time before 1605. This carried coal for James Clifford from his mines down to the river Severn to be loaded onto barges and carried to riverside towns.Peter King, 'The First Shropshire Railways' in G. Boyes (ed.), Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008 (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), 70‚Äì84. Though the first documentary record of this is later, its construction probably preceded the Wollaton Wagonway, completed in 1604, hitherto regarded as the earliest British installation. This ran from Strelley to Wollaton near Nottingham. Another early wagonway is noted onwards. Huntingdon Beaumont, who was concerned with mining at Strelley, also laid down broad wooden rails near Newcastle upon Tyne, on which a single horse could haul fifty to sixty bushels (130‚Äì150 kg) of coal.M. J. T. Lewis, Early Wooden railways. By the 18th century, such wagonways and tramways existed in a number of areas. Ralph Allen, for example, constructed a tramway to transport stone from a local quarry to supply the needs of the builders of the Georgian terraces of Bath. The Battle of Prestonpans, in the Jacobite rising of 1745, was fought astride the 1722 Tranent ‚Äì Cockenzie Waggonway. This type of transport spread rapidly through the whole Tyneside coalfield, and the greatest number of lines were to be found in the coalfield near Newcastle upon Tyne. They were mostly used to transport coal in chaldron wagons from the coalpits to a staithe (a wooden pier) on the river bank, whence coal could be shipped to London by collier brigs. The wagonways were engineered so that trains of coal wagons could descend to the staithe by gravity, being braked by a brakesman who would \\"sprag\\" the wheels by jamming them. Wagonways on less steep gradients could be retarded by allowing the wheels to bind on curves. As the work became more wearing on the horses, a vehicle known as a dandy wagon was introduced, in which the horse could rest on downhill stretches. Coal, iron, rail symbiosis A tendency to concentrate employees started when Benjamin Huntsman, looking for higher quality clock springs, found in 1740 that he could produce high quality steel in unprecedented quantities (crucible steel to replace blister steel) in using ceramic crucibles in the same fuel shortage/glass industry inspired reverbatory furnaces that were spurring the coal mining, coking, cast iron cannon foundries, and the much in demand gateway or stimulus products of the glass making industries. These technologies, for several decades, had already begun gradually quickening industrial growth and causing early concentrations of workers so that there were occasional early small factories that came into being.James Burke (science historian), Connections (1985), pages: 136-137, pbk: 304 pages, Little Brown & Co., New York, ISBN This trend concentrating effort into bigger central located but larger enterprises turned into a trend spurred by Henry Cort's iron processing patent of 1784 leading in short order to foundries collocating near coal mines and accelerating the practice of supplanting the nations cottage industries. With that concentration of employees and separation from dwellings, horsedrawn trams became commonly available as a commuter resource for the daily commute to work. Mine railways were used from 1804 around Coalbrookdale in such industrial concentrations of mines and iron works, all demanding traction-drawing of bulky or heavy loads. These gave rise to extensive early wooden rail ways and initial animal powered trains of vehicles, then successively in just two decades protective iron strips nailed to protect the rails, steam drawn trains (1804) cast iron rails. Later, George Stephenson, inventor of the world-famous Rocket and a board member of a mine, convinced his board to use steam for traction.George Stephenson#Early locomotives Next, he petitioned Parliament to license a public passenger railway, founding the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Soon after the intense public publicity, in part generated by the contest to find the best locomotive won by Stephenson's Rocket, railways underwent explosive growth worldwide, and the industrial revolution gradually went global. Company towns and child labour Today, most mine railways are electrically powered; in former times pit ponies, such as Shetland ponies, donkeys, and/or mules were used to haul the early mine trains. In the very cramped conditions of hand-hewn mining tunnels, children were also often used, and the animals were led and tended by boys (called 'mule boys' in the USA, aged 10-12). Until the movement against child labour pushed passage of laws requiring universal mandatory education of children to the sixth grade in the United States, in the Appalachian anthracite coal fields in Eastern Pennsylvania, these urchins were used and known as mule-boys into the 1920s, a position one step up the ladder towards the better pay as an apprentice miner (age 12+) from breaker boys, while the earnings of each stage allowed each group to return considerably more to their hard-scrabble families. Since many US mines were founded in remote areas and the joint stock companies imported workers from Europe who had to work off their passage in a company town purpose-built to staff the mine - a typical miner's family was constantly in debt to the company for board, rent, groceries, and tools most of their lives, so there was considerable social pressure from family and community for children to earn wages as soon as someone would pay them. Practices in Europe were little different, the mining interests owned the town lands, the buildings, the commercial enterprises established to support the workers from beer gardens, company stores to barbers, dentists, theaters and even doctors offices. The mining companies even ran the real estate offices, and happily sold lands to all comers so individuals gradually invested in such busy communities, including rights of way to railway companies. Rails Mine wagon on wooden rails from Transylvania, end of the 16th century There is usually no direct connection from a mine railway to the mine's industrial siding or the public railway network, because of the narrow-gauge track that is normally employed. In the United States, the standard gauge for mine haulage is , although gauges from to are used. Original mine railways used wax-impregnated wooden rails attached to wooden sleepers, on which drams were dragged by men, children or animals. This was later replaced by L-shaped iron rails, which were attached to the mine floor, meaning that no sleepers were required and hence leaving easy access for the feet of children or animals to propel more drams. Wood to cast iron These early mine railways used wooden rails, which in the early industrial revolution about Coalbrookdale, were soon capped with iron strapping, those were replaced by wrought iron, then with the first steam traction engines, cast iron rails, and eventually steel rails as each was in succession found to last much longer than the previous cheaper rail type. By the time of the first steam locomotive drawn trains, most rails laid were of wrought iron which was outlasting cast iron rails by 8:1. About three decades later, after Andrew Carnegie had made steel competitively cheap, steel rails were supplanting iron for the same longevity reasons. Motive power Riding on a mine car in Ashland, Pennsylvania The tram (or dram) cars used for mine haulage are generally called tubs. The term mine car is commonly used in the United States Pit ponies A preserved Dandy wagon of the Ffestiniog Railway. Before locomotives, slate trains would travel down to Porthmadog under gravity, and be pulled back up by horses The Romans were the first to realise the benefits of using animals in their industrial workings, using specially bred pit ponies to power supplementary work such as mine pumps. Pit ponies at work in 18th century French mine workings Ponies began to be used underground, often replacing child or female labour, as distances from pit head to coal face became greater. The first known recorded use in Britain was in the County Durham coalfield in 1750; in the United States, mules were the dominant source of animal power in the mine industry, with horses and ponies used to a lesser extent.H.H. Stoek, J.R. Fleming, A.J. Hoskin, A Study of Coal Mine Haulage in Illinois, Bulletin 132, University of Illinois Engineering Experiment Station, July 1922; pages 15-16. At the peak in 1913, there were 70,000 ponies underground in Britain. In later years, mechanical haulage was quickly introduced on the main underground roads replacing the pony hauls and ponies tended to be confined to the shorter runs from coal face to main road (known in North East England as \\"putting\\", in the United States as \\"tramming\\" or \\"gathering\\"H.H. Stoek, J.R. Fleming, A.J. Hoskin, A Study of Coal Mine Haulage in Illinois, Bulletin 132, University of Illinois Engineering Experiment Station, July 1922; page 70 and page 12.) which were more difficult to mechanise. As of 1984, 55 ponies were still at use with the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. Dandy wagons were often attached to trains of full drams, to contain a horse or pony. Mining and later railway engineers designed their tramways so that full (heavy) trains would use gravity down the slope, while horses would be used to pull the empty drams back to the workings. The Dandy wagon allowed for easy transportation of the required horse each time. Probably the last colliery horse to work underground in a British coal mine, Robbie, was retired from Pant y Gasseg, near Pontypool, in May 1999. Cable haulage In the 19th century after the mid-1840s, when the German invention of wire rope became available from manufacturies in both Europe and North America, large stationary steam engines on the surface with cables reaching underground were commonly used for mine haulage. Unsurprisingly, the innovation-minded managers of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company pioneered the technology in America using it to allow the dead-lift of loaded coal consists up the Ashley Planes, and the augmentation of their works in and above the Panther Creek Valley with new gravity switchback sections and return cable inclines, but most notably by installing two cable lift sections and expanding the already famous Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway with a 'back track' dropping car return time from 3‚Äì4 hours to about 20 minutes, which the new inclines then fed from new mine shafts and coal breakers farther down into the valley. Sometimes, stationary engines were even located underground, with the boiler on the surface, though that was a minority situation. All of the cable haulage methods were primarily used on the main haulage ways of the mine. Typically, manual labor, mules or pit ponies were used in gathering filled cars from the working areas (galleries were driven across seams as much as possible) to main haulage ways.Francis M. Fultz, An Iowa Coal Mine, Chapter V of Out of Door Studies in Geography, I, The Making of the Surface and Soils of the Upper Mississippi Region, 1908; pages 97-105, see page 101. In the first decade of the 20th century, electric locomotives were displacing animal power for this secondary haulage role in minesSydney F. Walker, Electrical Mining Notes, Electrical Review, Vol. 48, No. 1, January, 1906. where sparking triggered explosive methane buildup was a lesser danger. Several cable haulage systems were used: In slope mines, where there was a continuous downgrade from the entrance to the working face, the rope from the hoisting engine could be used to lower empty cars into the mine and then raise full cars. In shaft mines, secondary hoisting engines could be used to pull cars on grades within the mine. For grades of a few percent, trains of 25 cars each carrying roughly half a ton were typical in the 1880s.Wilhelm Hildenbrand, Section II, The Simple Engine Plane, The Underground Haulage of Coal by Wire Ropes, John A. Roebling's Sons Co., 1884; page 16. In mines where grades were not uniform or where the grades were not steep enough for gravity to pull a train into the mine, the main hoisting rope could be augmented with a tail rope connected to the opposite end of the train of mine cars. The tail-rope system had its origins on cable- hauled surface inclines prior to the 1830s.Nicholas Wood, Chapter IV ‚Äì Motive power, Section III ‚Äì Steam-engine fixed upon ascending planes, A Practical Treatise on Railr-Roads, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1832; page 114. This was the dominant system in the 1880sWilhelm Hildenbrand, Section III, The Tail Rope System, The Underground Haulage of Coal by Wire Ropes, John A. Roebling's Sons Co., 1884; page 22. Frequently, one engine was used to work both ropes, with the tail rope reaching into the mine, around a pulley at the far end, and then out again. Finally, the most advanced systems involved continuous loops of rope operated like a cable car system. Some mines used endless chains before wire-rope became widely available.Thomas J. Waters, Rope Haulage at the Westport Coal Company's Coalbrookdale Colliery, Westport, Papers read at the Mining Conference held at Dunedin, March 1890, George Didsbury, Government Printer, Wellington, NZ, 1890; page 12 The endless chain system originated in the mines near Burnley (England) around 1845. An endless rope system was developed in Nottinghamshire around 1864, and another independently developed near Wigan somewhat later (also in England).Report of the Tail-Rope Committee, Transactions of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, vol. XVII, Appendix I (1867-8), Newcastle upon Tyne, 1868. In these systems, individual cars or trains within the mine could be connected to the cable by a grip comparable to the grips used on surface cable car systems.Carl Volk, Haulage and Winding Appliances used in Mines, Scott, Greenwood & Co. London, 1903; page 113. In some mines, the haulage chain or cable went over the top of the cars, and cars were released automatically when the chain or cable was lifted away by an overhead pulley. Where the cable ran under the cars, a handheld grip could be used, where the grip operator would ride on the front car of the train working the grip chained to the front of the car. In some cases, a separate grip car was coupled to the head of the train.Wilhelm Hildenbrand, Section IV, The Endless Rope System, The Underground Haulage of Coal by Wire Ropes, John A. Roebling's Sons Co., 1884; page 37. At the dawn of the 20th century, endless rope haulage was the dominant haulage technology for the main haulage ways of underground mines. Steam locomotives A tank locomotive advertised in the H.K. Porter, Inc. 1908 catalog for use in underground mines Gnom, used on a mine in Switzerland For as long as it was economical to operate steam locomotives on the general railway system, steam locomotives were also used on the surface trackage of mines. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some large mines routinely used steam locomotives underground. Locomotives for this purpose were typically very squat tank engines with an 0-4-0 wheel arrangement. Use of steam power underground was only practical in areas with very high exhaust airflow, with engine speed limits of 1/2 the air velocity to assure adequate clean air for the crew on outbound trips. Such engines could not be used in mines with firedamp problems.Mine Haulage, The Elements of Mining Engineering, Vol. III, The Colliery Engineer Co., Scranton, 1900; paragraphs 2436-2437. Porter, Bell & Co. appears to have built the first underground mining locomotives used in the United States around 1870. By 1874, the Consolidation Coal Company and Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company were using several Porter locomotives in their underground mines in the Georges Creek Valley of Maryland. Other users included several coal mines near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company and an iron mine in the Lake Superior Iron Ranges. Porter's mine locomotives required a minimum 5-foot clearance and 4-foot width when operating on 3-foot gauge track, where they could handle a 20-foot radius curve.Light Locomotives, Saward's Coal Trade Journal, July 29, 1874; pages 39-40.Porter Bell & Co. 1873 advertisement. The Baldwin Locomotive Works built similar locomotives, starting in 1870.Baldwin Locomotive Works, Illustrated Catalog of Locomotives, second ed., Burnham, Parry, Williams & Co., Philadelphia, 1881; page 47.Mine Locomotives for Gold Mines, Railroad Gazette, October 12, 1877; page 453. Has good scale drawings. By the early 20th century, very small British-made oil-fired steam locomotives were in use in some South African mines.A Novel Mining Locomotive, The Locomotive Magazine, Vol. IX, No. 125 (Oct. 10, 1903); pages 214-215. Includes photo. Porter and Vulcan (Wilkes-Barre) advertised steam mine locomotives in 1909 and 1911.H.K. Porter Co., Advertisement, Engineering Magazine, Vol. XXVII, No. 6 (September 1909); advertising page 111.Vulcan Locomotives, Vulcan Iron Works, Wilkes- Barre, 1911; pages 70, 72, 86 and 105. By the early 1920s, only a few small mines in the Pocahontas Coalfield in West Virginia were using steam locomotives underground.H.H. Stoek, J.R. Fleming, A.J. Hoskin, A Study of Coal Mine Haulage in Illinois, Bulletin 132, University of Illinois Engineering Experiment Station, July 1922; page 17. Nonetheless, both Baldwin and Vulcan continued to advertise steam locomotives for underground use outside the coal industry as late as 1921.The Mining Catalog (Metal and Quarry Ed.), Keystone, Pittsburgh, 1921; pages 273 (Baldwin) and 275 (Vulcan). Compressed air locomotives Compressed air mine locomotive Compressed-air locomotives were powered by compressed air carried on the locomotive in compressed-air containers. This method of propulsion had the advantage of being safe but the disadvantage of high operating costs due to very limited range before it was necessary to recharge the air tanks. Generally, compressors on the surface were connected by plumbing to recharge stations located throughout the mine. Recharging was generally very fast. Narrow gauge compressed air locomotives were manufactured for mines in Germany as early as 1875, with tanks pressurized to 4 or 5 bar.Compressed Air Locomotives, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers Monthly Journal; vol. X, no. 1 (January, 1876); page 16. The Baldwin Locomotive Works delivered their first compressed air locomotive in 1877, and by 1904, they offered a variety of models, most with an 0-4-0 wheel arrangement.Compressed Air Locomotives, Record of Recent Construction No. 46, Baldwin Locomotive Works, 1904; page 14, mentions the first delivery; page 9 shows storage and working pressures; pages 13-14 discuss operation at 2000 psi. Compressed air locomotives were introduced in the Newbottle Collieries in Scotland in 1878, operating at 200 psi (14 bar).Professional Notes, Compressed Air Mine Locomotives, The School of Mines Quarterly, vol. II, no. 4 (May 1881), Columbia College, New York; pages 215-216. Ordinary mine compressed-air systems operating at 100 psi (7 bar) only allowed a few hundred feet of travel. By the late 1880s, Porter was building locomotives designed for 500 to 600 psi (34-41 bar).Compressed Air Mine Locomotive, The Colliery Engineer, vol. XII, no. 8 (March, 1892); page 183. By the early 1900s, locomotive air tank pressures had increased to from 600 to 800 psi (41-55 bar), although pressures up to 2000 psi (140 bar) were already envisioned. In 1911, Vulcan (Wilkes-Barre) was selling single-tank compressed-air locomotives operating at 800 psi (55 bar), double-tank models up to 1000 psi (69 bar) and one 6-tank model that may have operated at a much higher pressure.Vulcan Locomotives, Vulcan Iron Works, Wilkes-Barre, 1911; pages 74-78 and 97. The Homestake in South Dakota, USA used such high pressures, with special compressors and distribution piping. Except for very small prospects and remote small mines, battery or diesel locomotives have replaced compressed air. Overhead-electric locomotives Mine locomotive U 28 from AEG at the Verein Rothe Erde, Esch-sur-Alzette 1894 The electric motor technology used pre-1900 to DC with a few hundred volts and a direct supply of power to the motor from the overhead wire enabled the use of efficient, small and sturdy tractors of simple construction. Initially, there was no voltage standard, but by 1914, 250 volts was the standard voltage for underground work in the United States. This relatively low voltage was adopted for safety's sake.David R. Shearer, Chapger VI: Direct-Current Power Plant Design, Electricity in Coal Mining, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1914. The first electric mine railway in the world was developed by Siemens & Halske for bituminous coal mining in Saxon Zauckerode near Dresden (now Freital) and was being worked as early as 1882 on the 5th main cross-passage of the Oppel Shaft run by the Royal Saxon Coal Works.F.M.F. Cazin, How can Mining and Metallurgical Industry be Benefited by Electric Contrivances? Part II, [ Electric Power], Vol III, No. 35, (Nov. 1891); pages 405-409 (see pages 408-409 for a discussion of early German and U.S. electric mine haulage). In 1894, the mine railway of the Aachen smelting company, Rothe Erde, was electrically driven, as were subsequently numerous other mine railways in the Rhineland, Saarland Lorraine, Luxembourg and Belgian Wallonia. There were large scale deliveries of electric locomotives for these railways from AEG, Siemens & Halske, Siemens-Schuckert Works (SSW) and the Union Electricit√§ts-Gesellschaft (UEG) in these countries. The first electric mine locomotive in the United States went into service in mid 1887 in the Lykens Valley Coal Company mine in Lykens, Pennsylvania. The 35 hp motor for this locomotive was built by the Union Electric Company of Philadelphia.Schlesinger Electric Locomotive Motor, The Electrical World, Vol. XI, No. 8 (Feb. 25, 1888); page 88. Includes pictures of the traction motor. The 15000 pound (6800 kg) locomotive was named the Pioneer, and by mid 1888, a second electric locomotive was in service at that mine.The Electric Railway in the Lykens Valley Coal Mine, The Electrical World, Vol. XI, No. 24 (June 16, 1888); page 303. Includes a picture of the locomotive.The Union Electric Company, Philadelphia (Advertisement), The Electrical World, Vol. XI, No. 26 (June 30, 1888); page xv. Includes locomotive weights.T. C, Martin and Joseph Wetzler, Chapter XIII: Latest American Motors and Motor Systems, [The Electric Motor and its Applications, third ed.]; W. J. Johnston, New York, 1891; pages 218-224. Includes good illustrations of the Pioneer. Use in the Appalachian coal fields spread rapidly. By 1903, there were over 600 electric mine locomotives in use in America with new ones being produced at a rate of 100 per year.George Gibbs, The Electric Locomotive for Mine Haulage, Cassier's Magazine, vol. 22, no. 3 (July 1902); pages 323-343. Well illustrated. Initially, electric locomotives were used only where it was economical to string overhead line for power. This limited their usage for gathering loads at the mine face, where trackage was temporary and frequently relocated. This motivated the development of battery locomotives, but in the first decade of the 20th century the first successful electric gathering locomotives used cable reels. To run on tracks away from overhead lines, the power cable was clipped to the overhead line and then automatically unreeled as the locomotive advanced and reeled up as the locomotive returned.Seward Mighell, Locomotive, , granted July 7, 1903.Kenneth Rushton, Reel Attachment for Mine Locomotives, , granted Aug. 25. 1903.Cable-Reel Locomotives, The Coal Miners' Pocketbook, 11th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1916; page 826-827. Crab locomotives were equipped with a winch for pulling cars out of the un-powered tracks. This approach allowed use of temporary track that was too light to carry the weight of the a cable-reel or battery locomotive. The disadvantage of a crab locomotive was that someone had to pull the haulage cable from the winch to the working face, threading it over pulleys at any sharp turns.W. E. Hamilton, Locomotive Car Puller, , granted July 26, 1904.Crab Locomotives, The Coal Miners' Pocketbook, 11th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1916; page 827. Explosion-proof mining locomotives from Schalker Eisenh√ºtte are used in all the mines owned by Ruhrkohle (today Deutsche Steinkohle). Internal- combustion locomotives Deutz mine railway locomotive. The Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (Deutz Gas Engine Company), now Deutz AG, introduced a single-cylinder benzine locomotive for use in mines in 1897. Their first mining locomotives were rated at and weighed .A Benzine Lgocomotive for use in Mines, The Petroleum Industrial and Technical Revikgew, vol. 2, no. 68 (June 23, 1900); page 388.

Includes scale drawings. By 1914, Whitcomb Locomotive Works, Vulcan Iron Works, and Milwaukee Locomotive Manufacturing Co. (later merged with Whitcomb) were making gasoline mining locomotives in the United States with 4 and 6 cylinder engines.Joseph A. Anglada, Gasoline Locomotives for Mines, The Gas Engine, Vol. XVI, No. 2 (Feb. 1914); pages 100-103. Includes photos. Late 19th and early 20th century mine railway locomotives were operated with petrol benzene and alcohol / benzene mixtures.Heise-Herbst, Bergbaukunde, Springer-Verlag 1910, p. 345 ff. Although such engines were initially used in metal mines, they were in routine use in coal mines by 1910. Firedamp safety was achieved by wire gauze shields over intake and exhaust ports as well as cooling water injection in the exhaust system. Bubbling the exhaust through a water bath also greatly reduced noxious fumes.A Unique English Internal Combustion Mining Locomotive, Mining Science, Vol. LXI, No. 1573 (Mar. 24, 1910); page 272. Includes photo. For safety (noxious fumes as well as flammability of the fuel) modern mine railway internal combustion locomotives are only operated using diesel fuel. Catalytic scrubbers reduce carbon monoxide. Other locomotives are electric, either battery or trolley. Battery-electric locomotives Trainload of chrome ore emerging from a mine tunnel at the Ben Bow chromite mine in Stillwater County, Montana Battery powered locomotives and systems solved many of the potential problems that combustion engines present, especially regarding fumes, ventilation and heat generation. Compared to simple electric locomotives, battery locomotives do not need trolley wire strung over each track. However, batteries are heavy items which used to require long periods of charge to produce relatively short periods of full-power operation, resulting in either restricted operations or the need for the doubling-up of equipment purchasing. In the 19th century, there was considerable speculation about the potential use of battery locomotives in mines.Electric Underground Haulage, The Coal Trade Journal, Oct. 3, 1894; page 726.J. S. Doe, The Iser vs. the Waser, Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual Meeting of the Ohio Institute of Mining Engineers, Jan 19-21, 1898, Columbus, published as The Ohio Mining Journal, No. 27, (1899); pages 60-66, see particularly page 62.Francis A. Pocock, Accumulators and Mining, presented at the New York Meeting, Sept. 1890, Trans. Amer. Inst. of Mining Engineers, Vol. XIX (1891); pages 278-282. By 1899, Baldwin-Westinghouse had delivered an experimental battery locomotive to a Virginia mine; battery recharging occurred whenever the locomotive was running under trolley wire, while it could run from battery when working on temporary trackage near the face. This locomotive was eventually successful, but only after the voltage on the trolley system was stabilized.Harry K. Myers, A Combined Trolley and Storage Battery Locomotive for Mines, American Electrician, Vol. XI, No. 11 (Nov. 1899); page 512-513. A Siemens and Haske pure storage battery locomotive was in use in a coal mine in Gelsenkirchen (Germany) by 1904.J. F. Gairns, Industrial Locomotives for Mining, Factory and Allied Uses, part III, Cassier's Magazine, Vol. XXVI, No. 5 (Sept. 1904); pages 474-496; see photo on page page 474, text on page 489. One problem with battery locomotives was battery replacement. This was simplified by use of removable battery boxes. Eventually, battery boxes were developed that included wheels so that they could be rolled off of the locomotive.Eugene W. Schellentrager and Bradley E. Clarkson, Storage-Battery Locomotive, , granted April 25, 1922. While the initial motivation had to do with battery maintenance, the primary use for this idea was at charging stations where a discharged battery box could be rolled off and replaced with a freshly charged box.William T. Petterson, Locomotive Battery Changing Mechanism, , granted Feb. 7, 1961. While popular, battery systems were often practically restricted to mines where systems were short, and moving relatively low-density ore which could explode easily. Today, heavy-duty batteries provide full-shift (8 hours) operations with one or more spare batteries charging. In operation Passenger wagon on a mine railway Until 1995 the largest single, narrow gauge, above-ground, mine and coal railway network in Europe was in the Leipzig- Altenburg lignite field in Germany. It had of ‚Äì the largest network in existence. Of this, about 215 kilometres was removable track inside the actual pits and 511 kilometres was fixed track for the transportation of coal to the main rail network. The last gauge mine railway in the German state of Saxony, a major mining area in central Europe, was closed in 1999 at the Zwenkau Mine in Leipzig. Once a very extensive railway network, towards the end it only had of movable track and of fixed railway track within the Zwenkau open cast mine site itself, as well as a , standard gauge, link railway for the coal trains to the power stations (1995‚Äì1999). The closure of this mine marked the end of the history of mine railways in the lignite mines of Saxony. In December 1999, the last railway in the Central German coal mining field in Lusatia was closed. In the United States, Consol Energy's Shoemaker Mine, covering a large area east of Benwood, West Virginia was the last underground coal mine to use rail haulage. Starting in 2006, 12 miles of underground conveyor belt and 2.5 miles of above ground conveyor belt were installed. The last load of coal was hauled by rail in January 2010.Shoemaker Mine banks on future, The Times Leader, Martin's Ferry Ohio, Jan 28, 2010.

It tells of the friendship between Pwyll, prince of Dyfed, and Arawn, lord of Annwn (the Otherworld), of the courting and marriage of Pwyll and Rhiannon and of the birth and disappearance of Pryderi. This branch introduces a number of storylines that reappear in later tales, including the alliance between Dyfed and Annwn, and the enmity between Pwyll and Gwawl. Along with the other branches, the tale can be found in the medieval Red Book of Hergest and White Book of Rhydderch. William John Gruffydd proposed that the tale represented a medieval representation of the stories of Maponos and Dea Matrona.Gruffydd, W. J. Rhiannon: An Inquiry into the Origins of the First and Third Branches of the Mabinogi Synopsis Whilst hunting in Glyn Cuch, Pwyll, prince of Dyfed becomes separated from his companions and stumbles across a pack of hounds feeding on a slain stag. Pwyll drives the hounds away and sets his own hounds to feast, earning the anger of Arawn, lord of the otherworldly kingdom of Annwn. In recompense, Pwyll agrees to trade places with Arawn for a year and a day, taking on the lord's appearance and takes his place at Arawn's court. At the end of the year, Pwyll engages in single combat against Hafgan, Arawn's rival, and mortally wounds him with one blow and earns Arawn overlordship of all of Annwn. After Hafgan's death, Pwyll and Arawn meet once again, revert to their old appearance and return to their respective courts. They become lasting friends because Pwyll slept chastely with Arawn's wife for the duration of the year. As a result of Pwyll's successful ruling of Annwn, he earns the title ; \\"Pwyll, head of Annwn.\\" Some time later, Pwyll and his noblemen ascend the mound of Gorsedd Arberth and witness the arrival of Rhiannon, appearing to them as a beautiful woman dressed in gold silk brocade and riding a shining white horse. Pwyll sends his best horsemen after her, but she always remains ahead of them, though her horse never does more than amble. After three days he finally calls out to her asking her to stop. Rhiannon does so immediately and says she will gladly stop and it would have been better for the horse if he had asked sooner. She then tells him she has come seeking him because she would rather marry him than her fiance, Gwawl ap Clud. They set their wedding day a year after their first meeting and on that day Pwyll sets out for the court of Hyfaidd Hen. At their wedding feast a man shows up and asks to make a request of Pwyll who replies the man may have whatever he asks for. The man then reveals himself as Gwawl ap Clud and asks for Rhiannon and the wedding feast, which Pwyll is obliged to give. Rhiannon, unhappy with this turn of events explains that the feast is hers and not Pwyll's to give away and it has already been promised to the guests and hosts. She explains that after another year an equal feast will be prepared for her and Gwawl ap Clud, and he leaves back to his realm. One year later the day of the feast arrives and now it is Pwyll Pen Annwfn who comes to the wedding feast, in disguise and with an enchanted bag given to him by Rhiannon, to ask for a request. Gwawl ap Clud, being more clever than Pwyll replies that if the request is reasonable he shall have it. Pwyll then asks for only enough food to fill his bag and Gwawl ap Clud complies. The bag being enchanted though, could not be filled and eventually Gwawl ap Clud himself enters the bag to honour his promise and Pwyll closes it and the bag is hung and struck repeatedly by Pwyll's men. Under the advice of his noblemen, Pwyll and Rhiannon attempt to supply an heir to the kingdom and eventually a boy is born. However, on the night of his birth, he disappears while in the care of six of Rhiannon's ladies-in-waiting. To avoid the king's wrath, the ladies smear dog's blood onto a sleeping Rhiannon, claiming that she had committed infanticide and cannibalism through eating and \\"destroying\\" her child. Rhiannon is forced to do penance for her crime. The child is discovered outside a stable by an ex-vassal of Pwyll's, Teyrnon, the lord of Gwent Is Coed. He and his wife claim the boy as their own and name him Gwri Wallt Euryn (English: Gwri of the Golden hair), for \\"all the hair on his head was as yellow as gold.\\"The Mabinogion. Davies, Sioned. 2005. The child grows to adulthood at a superhuman pace and, as he matures, his likeness to Pwyll grows more obvious and, eventually, Teyrnon realises Gwri's true identity. The boy is eventually reunited with Pwyll and Rhiannon and is renamed , meaning \\"anxiety\\". The tale ends with Pwyll's death and Pryderi's ascension to the throne. Mythology A common feature in Celtic myths is fairy folk, or sidh. They could take many forms and sizes, but they would often appear human. They could change the appearance of things as well. Arawn being able to change his and Pwyll‚Äôs appearances implies that he was of the fairy folk. In fact, Annwn was a sort of fairy kingdom, or otherworld. Rhiannon was likely also one of the fairy folk because of the illusion she created of her horse being always ahead of Pwyll‚Äôs knights even though it only ever seemed to amble. Fairies were known to have sexual relationships with humans from time to time. Sometimes these relationships were fleeting, but sometimes they were lasting, as was the case with Rhiannon and Pwyll. Because Rhiannon was a fairy, her son would have been half-fairy, which is why he was able to grow at a superhuman pace. It was also somewhat common for fairies to steal children, as with Rhiannon and Pwyll‚Äôs son. Magic often plays a very important role in Celtic Literature. Pwyll, The Prince of Dyfed, is involved in many instances of magic throughout the Mabinogi. Shapeshifting is one example of magic of which Pwyll is a part. There is always one individual who holds the power to shape shift, and that power can change hands during different parts of the story. One example of this is in the first branch of the Mabinogi, the power to shift shapes lies with Arawn (the king of the Otherworld) and in the fourth branch, the power lies with Math and his nephew Gwydion. Some other examples of magic that involve Pwyll include the magic that surrounds his wife, Rhiannon. She rides a magical horse, who can outrun any other horse, including that of Pwyll. Rhiannon also has a bag which can never be filled unless a magical phrase is said in its presence. In Celtic mythology, there were also several common themes and symbols. One was a cauldron that was never empty, like Rhiannon‚Äôs bag which can never be filled. Another one was a trip to a mysterious land, where the hero would have to perform impossible feats. Examples of this are when Pwyll went to Annwn to fight Hafgan and when he had to win Rhiannon back from Gwawl ap Clud. There were also sometimes seasonal contests such as Pwyll waiting a year to fight Hafgan or win back Rhiannon.

Indy and 1990 Preakness Stakes winner Summer Squall. She was sired by the famous Triple Crown winner Secretariat. Although best known as a broodmare, Weekend Surprise was also a success on the track, winning seven races including the Schuylerville, Golden Rod and Pocahontas Stakes in 1982 as a two-year-old. She also placed in multiple stakes races at ages three and four. Racing career Weekend Surprise raced nine times as a two-year-old, winning five times with one second place and two third-place finishes. She won in her first start at Keeneland on April 21, 1982, then finished second in the Rosedale Stakes at Belmont on June 2. She next won the Schuylerville Stakes before finishing fifth in the Spinaway Stakes, both races held at Saratoga in August. She then finished third in two Grade I stakes at Belmont Park ‚Äì the Matron and Frizette Stakes. She finished the year with two stakes wins at Churchill Downs in the Golden Rod and Pocahontas Stakes. On the Experimental Free Handicap, she was rated 114 pounds ‚Äì 7 pounds below the two-year-old champion filly Landaluce. Her three-year-old campaign was less successful, with only 1 win from 10 starts. The highlights were second-place finishes in the Cumberland Handicap and Pleasant Hill Stakes, both at Churchill Downs, and third-place finishes in the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico and the La Troienne Stakes at Churchill Downs. At age four, the durable mare raced 12 times with only 1 win. The year started with promise when she finished second in both the El Encino and La Canada Stakes, then third in the Santa Margarita Invitational, but she had a series of poor performances over the spring and early summer in California. Shipped back east, she improved to finish third in the Grade I Delaware Handicap, followed by a third and her lone win of the year in allowance races. In her final race on November 9, she finished third in the Grade II Long Look Handicap at the Meadowlands. Broodmare career Weekend Surprise produced 14 foals, 9 of whom became winners. She is one of the few mares to have produced two winners of American Classic races, Summer Squall and A. P. Indy. In 1992 she was voted the Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Her offspring also include Honor Grades, Tiger Ridge, Devongate, Amirati, Weekend Storm, Norway, Eavesdropper, Welcome Surprise, Saithor, and Weekend In Seattle. She died on March 13, 2001 shortly after foaling a filly by the sire Belong To Me. Pedigree Weekend Surprise was sired by Secretariat, the 1973 American Triple Crown winner and two-time Horse of the Year. Thanks in part to the success of Weekend Surprise's son A.P. Indy, Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America of 1992. Her dam Lassie Dear was a stakes winner by Buckpasser, another Horse of the Year and leading broodmare sire. Lassie Dear also produced Group I winner Wolfhound and multiple stakes winners. Another of Lassie Dear's daughters produced American champion Lemon Drop Kid, while a third daughter is the second dam of Epsom Derby winner Ruler of the World. The family traces back to Missy Baba, who also produced Kentucky Broodmare of the Year Toll Booth. Because of her success as a broodmare, some believe that Weekend Surprise was a \\"double copy\\" mare, referring to a hypothetical \\"X-factor\\" (a gene or genes carried on the X-chromosome that can result in a large heart). When the \\"X-factor\\" is present on both sides of the pedigree, a mare is more likely to pass it on to her offspring. A mare with only one copy of the X-factor has a 50-50 chance of passing on the trait. Sires can only inherit the trait from their dam and can only pass it on to daughters. Secretariat would thus have received his copy from his dam Somethingroyal. Weekend Surprise's dam Lassie Dear may have inherited the trait from her sire, Buckpasser, or through her dam, who also descends from Somethingroyal. Weekend Surprise is inbred 2s √ó 4d to Somethingroyal, meaning Somethingroyal appears in the 2nd generation of the sire's side of the pedigree and in the fourth generation of the dam's side.

Professional Wrestling career=The Beginning Originally from Philadelphia PA (born) and later moved to Southern California to be trained by Jesse Hernandez(EWF) & Joey Ryan(M1W) and wrestle shows for companies such as National Wrestling Alliance, Empire Wrestling Fed, Alternative Wrestling Solution, New Wave Pro, & Mach 1 Wrestling. He also has wrestled up north in Oregon for West Coast Wrestling Connection.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhr2FF7yjAA David started as a rather cocky typical heel wrestling character with a phenomenal body but is rather short in stature. Within short time he grew to being an overly flamboyant character with a touch of being that personal trainer you would never want to hire due to his ridiculously mean comments directed towards the crowd and their physique issues. Flex was mainly used as a filler heel character but got over with the crowd by his outlandish antics and because he included the crowd into the show by having them do certain exercises and then yelling at them to sit back down in their chair and that they will never look like him. Wrestling Journey Flex made his debut on October 2 for EWF in wrestling another independent wrestler who was making their debut in one Gregory Sharpe. In this encounter Flex went over Sharpe with a roll-up with the tights signifying that Flex wasn't going to be playing by the rules. The very next day Flex had tagged with Brandon Parker at Mach1Wrestling's ‚ÄúWrath of Con 2009‚Äù at the Long Beach Convention Center for the largely known Comic Con Event. In this encounter Flex would take his first lose in the ring getting pinned by visiting Australian Kiel Steria with a Yakuza Kick busting Flex wide open. Flex would go on to sparsely work for EWF but never develop an actual feud with any one star in particularwrestling opponents such as Sonny Samson, Vizzion and at the current time EWF Cruiserweight champion Chris Kadillak. Flex wrestled at California's big joint promotion ‚ÄúEWF & AWS United Forces 2‚Äù wrestling Brandon Gatson and coming up short in a lackluster performance to Gatson's twiltawhirl flapjack finisher.

Flex was managed by then local Oregon wrestler/manager Brian Zane who helped Flex get under the Ore-o-gon fans skin! Flex had wrestled a few shows for the NWA in Phoenix AZ with which he was billed by NWA branded name David Frazier or David ‚ÄúFlex‚Äù Frazier. Flex had his most exhibitions in the Anaheim, CA based promotion an affiliate of NWA Mach1Wrestling in which he competed against the likes of many M1W and NWA rising stars.

The episode is set during Saint Patrick's Day and progresses the relationship between Nucky and Margaret. The title is taken from the title line of an Irish folk song, Carrickfergus.

Nucky is skeptical of Eli's efforts to improve at public speaking, but reluctantly accedes. Local dwarves, who work at a boxing ring, are hired to dress up as leprechauns for the Dinner. When they complain about the degrading gig, their leader Carl promises to have Nucky double their pay. In Chicago, Jimmy takes care of Pearl after her disfigurement, but she continues her spiral into depression and laudanum addiction. Torrio orders her evicted because her scarred face prevents her from working as a prostitute. Jimmy offers to pay for her keep, but realizes he cannot afford to. Pearl seems to understand her predicament: later that night, she drunkenly flaunts her scarred face in the lounge and, after a last kiss with Jimmy, fatally shoots herself while he is washing up. Subsequently, Jimmy visits an opium den in Chinatown. Nucky meets with his ward bosses, who anticipate large profits from selling booze on St. Patrick's Day. Nucky jokes about Eli's upcoming speech at the Dinner, to the amusement of everyone but an offended Eli. Carl comes to see Nucky, who bribes him into selling the other dwarves on a much smaller raise. Elsewhere, in New York City, Rothstein reads a newspaper article about the unfolding Black Sox Scandal and tells his lawyer he is worried about his involvement becoming known. Meanwhile, Gillian suggests that Jimmy's wife Angela should start over with another man, even offering to raise Jimmy's son for her. Angela angrily rejects her offer and leaves to meet a \\"friend\\", who is later revealed to live in the Boardwalk's photography studio. At the Dinner, Eli's speech is a debacle, inflaming a factional dispute and forcing Nucky to intercede. Eli drinks heavily and reveals his resentment of his brother's easy charm and diplomatic skill. Van Alden, acting on Margaret's information, raids the Dinner, arrests Neary in front of Nucky, and shuts the event down. Nucky sees Margaret with the Temperance League, cheering on the raid, and realizes what she has done. Later that night, he visits Margaret's home unannounced. They abruptly embrace and begin a physical relationship.  Reception = Critical reception  IGN said the episode was \\"Outstanding\\" and gave the episode 9/10. They said \\"For those who are still on the fence about Boardwalk Empire's greatness, shut up and watch episode five, \\"Nights in Ballygran\\". The episode features the show's strongest character interactions yet, as Margaret's role in the Temperance League threatens both Nucky's political and criminal enterprises as Federal Agent Van Alden applies pressure to both.\\" \\"The more shows like this make it harder for their main characters to do the right thing - the farther away they get from what the right thing is - is when television approaches being great.

This phenomenon underlies the mechanism of action of several antibacterial, antimalarial and anticancer agents, such as trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, methotrexate and fluorouracil.  History  The phenomenon was first reported in 1954 by Hazel D. Barner and Seymour S. Cohen in Escherichia coli when thymine-requiring mutants of the bacteria lost viability when grown in a medium lacking thymine but containing other essential nutrients.50 years ago in cell biology - A virologist recalls his work on cell growth inhibition Subsequently, this discovery led to the development of theories to explain the mechanism of action of several pyrimidine analogs that targeted thymine metabolism in bacteria and tumor cells. The phenomenon was commonly attributed to \\"unbalanced growth\\" wherein cells continued fundamental processes of RNA transcription, protein synthesis and metabolism in the absence of DNA replication. However, nutrient starvation does not generally kill cells to the extent observed in cells that lack thymine. The molecular mechanism of thymineless death remains unknown; DNA breaks were observed during thymineless death, which could explain the killing. Possible pathways involved with the killing mechanism include: replication initiation, breakage of ongoing replication forks, futile DNA repair, replication origin destruction, and an addiction module.
