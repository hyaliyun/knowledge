She was a patroness of the arts, having commissioned works of art and calligraphy during her lifetime. Most of her collection dated to the period of the Song dynasty.Elliot, Jeannette Shambaugh; Shambaugh, David (2007). The Odyssey of China's Imperial Art Treasures (Samuel and Althea Stroum Books), pp. 32-33  Early life  Sengge Ragi was the daughter of (posthumously known as Shun- tsung) (b. ca. 1265 ‚Äì d. 1310), who, according to the History of Yuan, was the eldest son of Zhenjin, second son of Kublai Khan as well as his heir apparent until his death. Darmabala had a close relationship with his father, who greatly valued Chinese culture and learning.Weidner, Marsha (1990). Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese and Japanese Painting. p. 61 Her mother was Dagi, who came from the influential Khongirad tribe. The princess had three brothers: the eldest, a step-brother, was eventually invested with the title of Prince of Wei. The other two brothers were full brothers and became emperors. Khayishan, her elder brother, ruled from 1307 until his death in 1311, and was succeeded by his brother, Ayurbarwada, who ruled from 1311 to 1320. It was from these two brothers that Sengge Ragi first rose to great prominence. In his first year as emperor, her elder brother, as K√ºl√ºg Khan, granted her the titles of Grand Princess of Lu () and Princess Supreme of Lu (). Normally an emperor's sisters are only accorded the title of \\"grand princess\\", as \\"princess supreme\\" is traditionally reserved for his aunts. Her husband, Diwabala, was granted the title of Prince Consort of Lu. The following year, he granted her the Route of Yongping, from which she could receive income. He also desired that she have Yongping‚Äôs salt taxes, but this was opposed by officials of the Secretariat. Sengge Ragi‚Äôs younger brother, as Buyantu Khan, also increased his sister‚Äôs fortune. He gave to her a grant of 10,000 ding in currency (equal to 500,000 ounces of silver), and soon after granted her the title of ‚ÄúImperial Elder Sister and Princess Supreme‚Äù ().  Religious Charity  In 1319, the princess sponsored a series of charitable acts in accordance with her Buddhist faith. The most notable of these acts was the release of twenty-seven important prisoners from the Ch‚Äôuan-ning District. These prisoners were later recaptured, however, as the pardoning of criminals was solely the prerogative of the emperor.Watt, James Y. C. (2010). The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty (Metropolitan Museum of Art), p. 19  The ‚ÄúElegant Gathering‚Äù  In 1323, Sengge Ragi held a historic ‚Äúelegant gathering‚Äù, which was made unique by the fact that the event was hosted by a woman.Weidner, Marsha (1990). Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese and Japanese Painting. p. 62 During the event, a number of scrolls were brought out and the scholars present were instructed to add colophons to them. A series of notable calligraphies and paintings were presented at this event, most dating from the Song period, and today there are some fifteen extant works of art that bear either one or both of the princess‚Äôs seals: the ‚ÄúLibrary of the Imperial Elder Sister‚Äù () and ‚ÄúPrecious Plaything of the Imperial Elder Sister‚Äù ().Weidner, Marsha (1990). Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese and Japanese Painting. p. 65  The ‚ÄúImperial Aunt‚Äù  Although the elegant gathering of 1323 stood as the pinnacle of the princess‚Äôs career, it was not the end of her power and influence. The following year, her daughter, Budashiri, married Tugh Tem√ºr, Sengge Ragi's nephew (the son of her elder brother Khayishan). When Tugh Tem√ºr ascended to the throne in 1328, he increased his mother-in-law's position considerably with new titles and wealth, as well as the title of ‚ÄúImperial Aunt‚Äù (). Early in 1329, he granted her 20,000 ding in currency in order to build a residence, and some months later gave her another 20,000 ding for building costs. Late in that year, Tugh Tem√ºr issued an imperial edict, which was for the collection of rent from princes, princesses, government offices and temples, though the grand princess was excepted by name.Weidner, Marsha (1990). Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese and Japanese Painting. pp. 67-68 Several times over, the emperor granted his mother-in-law many gifts, not least in the form of vast sums of money, which she channeled into the construction of her residence, completed sometime in 1330 or early 1331. He gave her large acres of land, and appointed an administrator to oversee the construction of her residence. However, the illustrious grand princess would have had very little time to enjoy the completed work, as she died in early 1331.Weidner, Marsha (1990). Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese and Japanese Painting. p. 69 Although heavily involved in the collecting of Chinese art and calligraphy, no stamps make any reference to the ‚ÄúImperial Aunt‚Äù. It appears that in her later years, though her position was elevated and she became increasingly lavish in her spending, Sengge Ragi did not advance much as an art collector. Nevertheless, her unique role in hosting the elegant gathering and collecting many fine pieces of art during her lifetime grant her a unique position in the cultural legacy of the Yuan Dynasty.Weidner, Marsha (1990).

Commercial General Liability (CGL) is the specific name for a policy of this type in the United States insurance market. It is the \\"first line\\" of coverage that a business typically purchases, and covers many of the common risks that can happen to any type of business, such as bodily injury or property damage on the business premises or due to the business operations, personal and advertising injury, and medical payments. As with other types of liability insurance, CGL insurance normally imposes on issuing insurers duties both to defend and to indemnify insureds with respect to covered claims. CGL insurance is generally categorized as an \\"all-risks\\" type of insurance, under which it provides coverage for risks unless specifically excluded. Specific risks that are normally excluded from CGL coverage include professional services, pollution, liquor, automobile liability, and directors and officers liability, and separate insurance policies are available to cover these situations. A wide variety of other coverage exclusions, extensions, limitations, and other policy terms and conditions may be included by endorsements to a CGL policy.  Construction defects coverage  Whether or not general liability insurance covers construction defects or \\"faulty workmanship\\" is a matter of some debate, as some insurers have viewed poor workmanship as a risk that is covered by a surety bond rather than an insurance policy given that a construction professional may have some influence (through attention to detail, skill, and effort) over whether such a defect occurs.

A substantial reduction in the number of railway employees resulted from these changes. In both its scope and consequences, the Bland Report was similar to the Beeching Review in Britain.

While portrayed as Algerian when she gained fame as an actress, she is of French nationality. Film career Outcast of the Islands was set in Indonesia and her role was that of a native girl. In casting the role, director Carol Reed sought someone \\"seductive, radiant\\", \\"as the soul of the country with its mysterious forests.\\" He felt no available actresses were right for the part. In an interview with Der Spiegel, he claimed to have searched for almost a year in Egypt, Singapore, and Borneo, auditioning \\"dancers, fashion models, beauty queens\\" before friends recommended Kerima, \\"daughter of a very wealthy Arab in Algiers\\". Although her background was not Indonesian, film publicity sought to portray her as an indigenous islander. In London, she was quoted as saying \\"I live the life of Nature. I ride bareback, I walk barefoot, I swim bare.\\" As she had no acting experience, her role was completely non-verbal. Reed never used the voice of amateurs or children in his films. Had her voice been used, a French accent would have been obvious. A heavily publicized kissing scene in the movie lasted 112 seconds. This \\"marathon kiss\\" was the subject of a Life magazine article which included the photo of Kerima on the cover. This scene was used in advertising to entice people to see the film. It was considered \\"shocking\\" to some critics and \\"met with difficulty\\" by American censors. Kerima was active in film throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, working with Italian and American directors including Joseph Mankiewicz and Howard Hawks. Her last known work were minor parts in 1972, the last being a bellydancer in one episode of The Adventurer, a British TV series.https://itctv.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/the-adventurer- season-1-episode-7-love-always-magda/ Ethnicity To create more publicity for Kerima and the movie Outcast, an exotic-island-girl image consistent with her role was created by the film's executive producer, Alexander Korda. He claimed she was born in Algeria. A search of birth records in Algerian newspapers was conducted around 2006 without locating any documentation of her birth. Her husband Guy Hamilton, an assistant director of Outcast, was then contacted and asked about Kerima's background. He confirmed that she was born in France to French parents, is a French citizen, and that Korda created the name Kerima and the associated persona of an exotic Javanese native to promote the movie. Another source claims her real name was Miriam, but instead of having her study medicine, she was \\"selling jewellery in the South of France\\". Her exotic looks did enable her to play various different nationalities, including an Egyptian in Land of the Pharaohs, a Vietnamese woman in The Quiet American and even a \\"she-wolf\\" in the Italian horror film La Lupa. In addition to Algerian, she has also been described as \\"a beautiful Pakistani actress\\", as well as Italian, Indonesian, and Tunisian. Personal life She was born in Toulouse, France to French parents. She studied medicine before finding success in acting. \\"Kerima\\" is a stage name created at the time of her first role when she was known as Miriam Charri√®re, a non-professional actress. She was \\"discovered\\" in Paris by the director of Outcast of the Islands, Carol Reed. By age 23, she was fluent in French, Spanish, and Italian. Kerima was first married in 1953 to Greek actor Alexis Revidis. They were secretly married in Rome in January, but did not publicize the marriage until October. They were later divorced.

It was established in Chicago, Illinois in 1853. In 2013, it was announced that Central National-Gottesman had acquired the assets and business of Bradner Central Company which operated Brander Smith. History The firm of Bradner Smith & Co., manufacturers and dealers in paper, was established in 1853 at No. 12 LaSalle Street in a store. It became one of the largest paper firms in the world, doing a business of US$2,000,000 a year. The firm had three establishments in the city of Chicago, branch houses at Kansas City, Missouri, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Saint Paul, Minnesota. It operated six paper mills, manufacturing and selling every sort and size of news, book, wrapping, writing, blotting, and other papers, card board, envelopes, twines, wood pulp, and paper manufacturers' supplies. There was very little paper manufactured in the West when Bradner Smith & Co. commenced business, and most of their stock was brought from East Coast mills. The company was able to make their own stock, and to supply hundreds of other houses with their manufactures, shipping paper by the trainload from their several mills. Bradner Smith & Co. commenced manufacturing in 1854 at Rockton, Illinois. Its purchased a Winnebago mill, which manufactured ten tons per day of express, manilla, rag, and straw wrapping paper. Their other manufactories were the Ledyard Pulp Mill, at Ledyard, Wisconsin, which made four tons of dry pulp per day; the Rozet Mill, at Three Rivers, which produced four tons per day of print and book paper; the Tippecanoe Paper Mill, at Monticello, Indiana. which made two tons of print paper daily, the Marinette Mill, at the place of the same name in Wisconsin, manufactured five tons of print paper, and the mill at Menominee, Michigan, which produced four tons of manilla paper and six tons of wood pulp daily. Products Besides their own manufactories, Bradner Smith & Co. carried wedding and other stationery, imported and domestic, the Hurlbut plate paper, Crane's pure linen flats, the Germanic flat and ledger papers, and all other classes of goods used by stationers, printers, book-binders, and publication houses. Regular sizes and standard weights were stocked, but special sizes and weights could be made to order and furnished at mill prices. A stock of colored papers was on hand, and specialized papers for special purposes would be made to order in quantities to suit. They were also manufacturers of map paper, and furnished any weight or size requested. In cover papers, Bradner Smith & Co. had the largest and best-assorteded stock in the US. The firm was the sole agent for the sale of Weston's pure linen ledger and record papers, which were awarded the gold medal at the Paris Exposition and the highest award at the Centennial Exposition for a combination of all the desirable qualities. They were also sole agents for the celebrated \\"commercial safety paper,\\" for checks, notes, bills of exchange, bonds, letters of credit, and so on, which had been officially endorsed and recommended by the clearing-house authorities of the principal cities in the US. Bradner Smith & Co. used the finest inks, which were known for their brilliancy of color and durability. They also carried a full line of all colors, sizes, and styles of envelopes, and made odd sizes to order. All kinds of fancy stationery and stationers' sundries were kept in stock, and also a full line of illustrated advertising cards, manufactured by Marques, Gair & Bailey, of Paris, London, and New York City.

The standards and procedures she created became a model for the federal government and other social work agencies. She was the first to identify the term \\"clinical social work\\" as a specialty standard with its own personnel specifications. Rinaldo was born in Sioux City, Iowa in 1906 (some accounts say 1906) and lived in Wheaton, Illinois until she started attending Smith College in 1923. Rinaldo graduated with honors in 1927. She continued at Smith and received a master's degree in Social Science in 1929. Her thesis was entitled, \\"The altering of family attitudes toward the child with prolonged illness as a causative factor of behavior problems : a study of fifty cases selected at the Institute for Child Guidance, New York City, from Child Guidance Clinic Records to weigh the importance as factors influencing behavior problems of prolonged illness on a child as compared to the effect of the illness in altering parental and siblings attitudes.\\" After receiving a social work degree she worked for the Children's Aid Society in Philadelphia. She later transferred to the county welfare agency in Philadelphia. In 1943 she moved to New York to work for the Social Security Agency. In 1946 she moved to Washington, DC to join the Veterans Administration where she worked until her retirement in 1972. At the Veterans Administration, Renaldo recruited hundreds of social workers to support the post World War II VA Medical Services expansion. In this position she established job standards and definitions which later influenced Civil Service requirements for other federal agencies, and for state and local health care programs. Rinaldo served on various committees at the National Association of Social Workers and was a key member of the Committee on the Study of Competence from 1963 to 1970. She was on the Academy of Certified Social Workers (ACSW) Board that developed the first examinations for the ACSW.

She is perhaps best known for conducting a milestone, multi-year three-volume study in the 1970s for the American Cancer Society which provided the first systematic evidence that cancer patients faced discrimination in the workplace. Her areas of teaching had to do with social welfare, including its history, welfare policy, and administration. Her research and writings examine the psychological, social, and economic meanings of money and work in American families.  Biography = Early years = Frances Lomas Feldman had five older siblings and was born on December 3, 1912 in Philadelphia to Jewish parents who had immigrated to the US from Ukraine. At eight years old, she and her family moved to Los Angeles, Ca. She became a student in 1931 at the Los Angeles University of Southern California. There's some evidence she provided laundry services to pay for her tuition, and graduated in 1935 with a bachelor's degree. She went back to USC and in 1940 she graduated with a master's degree for Social Work. In 1935 she married a research chemist named Albert Feldman, who also became a social worker. He worked at the University of Southern California Andrus Gerontology Center as deputy director, which he continued until he died in 1975. = Social work and research = Her research provided evidence that employers and co-workers often imposed harsh and illegal conditions on cancer survivors. According to the National Association of Social Workers, several states modified fair employment legislation because of the study. In 1934, she became a social worker and administrator in the public welfare and the family service fields, focusing on social policy and administration. Her initial research was on the effect money stress has on families. This led her to found a national network of nonprofit credit counseling services called Consumer Credit Counselors with George Nickel, and 280 continue to exist under the auspices of the National Consumer Credit Association. She established the first faculty and staff counseling center at USC, now a blueprint for employee assistance programs across the country. She has served on a number of state and national committees and commissions, including chairing the Governor's Advisory Committee on Mental Health. In 1954 she became faculty member at University of Southern California for the School of Social Work. She worked as a professor and then as a professor emerita until 1982 when she officially retired. She continued to visit the campus twice a week and continued to pursue research in the psychological and social meanings of money and work in family life. She died on September 30, 2008, a week after having a stroke. Feldman was the author of 10 books and published many research papers and journal articles dedicated to the social or psychological meaning of life and work. She won the 2004 Wheat Award from the Southern California Historical Society for one of her works entitled \\"Human Services in the City of Angels: 1850-2000,\\" which she completed under the auspices of the Los Angeles City Historical Society. In 2005, she was inducted into the California Social Work Archives Hall of Distinction.

Her boyfriend, Ronald Roldan, says he saw her there later that day. She has not been seen since. While Decker did not show up at her job or classes she took at nearby George Mason University, her absence was not noted for another three weeks, since messages to her friends purportedly from her continued to be posted on her Facebook account. After her family noted her absence otherwise, they found her car parked near her apartment. Apart from the Facebook posts, there had been no other evidence she had done anything since the day she was last seen. They reported her missing to Loudoun County police. Decker was five months pregnant at the time of her disappearance. Extensive searches have found no trace of her or the child she might have given birth to. Roldan, who had a criminal record prior to the disappearance, is considered a person of interest in the case. In 2015, he was arrested in North Carolina and charged with the attempted murder of another girlfriend after he shot her during an incident in 2014; he has not said anything about the Decker case. After she recovered, the victim claimed on the Dr. Phil show that he had made statements to her that might implicate him in Decker's disappearance. Roldan pled guilty to two lesser charges in 2016; after he serves his sentence, he will be deported to his native Bolivia. The incident has been the subject of a segment of the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared. Background A native of Fredericksburg, Virginia, Bethany Decker attended George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax after graduating high school. She majored in global and economic change while working full-time. During her time at GMU, she became pregnant by Emile Decker, an Army National Guardsman. The two married in 2009; their son was born six months later. Emile was often deployed to Afghanistan with his unit for months at a time. During those times, Decker often left the boy with her in-laws in Columbia, Maryland, while she worked and attended classes. While working at a Centreville Italian restaurant, Decker met Ronald Roldan, a Bolivian immigrant then around 30, and began an extramarital affair with him. By late 2010, there were strains in the Deckers' marriage; Bethany moved to a separate apartment in Ashburn, Virginia. The relationship with Roldan soon followed, and he moved in with her. According to her family, Decker quickly found that Roldan was abusive, possessive, and controlling. Several times a day, he demanded that she send him a picture of herself from her cellphone to show who she was with. Her parents began developing a plan to get her out of the relationship. By the end of the year, she was pregnant. Disappearance In January 2011, Emile came back from his deployment for a month-long leave. Near the end of that period, he and Bethany went on a vacation to Hawaii for a week. They returned on January 28 and spent the night at his parents' home in Maryland. Emile's parents were unaware of the couple's marital difficulties. The next morning, Emile saw Decker before she went back to the Ashburn apartment. Roldan said he saw her there later that afternoon. Since then, no one else is known to have seen her. During that day, Decker called her employer to confirm her work schedule for the coming week, the last known contact she has had with anyone other than Emile or Roldan. On February 2, Emile's leave ended and he returned to Afghanistan. Friends who came to see him off at the airport noted that unlike previous such occasions, Decker was not there. They attributed her absence to the couple's marital problems. Investigation Friends and family say Decker did her best to keep in contact with them. But due to her busy life, balancing her classes in what was to be her final semester at GMU with a full-time job, they had gotten used to not hearing from her for several days at a time, so they were not worried as February 2011 began without any news from her. However, later in the month, several of Decker's friends called her mother, Kim Nelson, saying that they had received messages from her via her Facebook account that did not seem to them to have come from Decker. By February 19, not having heard from her daughter herself, Nelson asked her parents, who lived near Ashburn, to drive by and see if she was there. Decker's Hyundai was still out front, but it was parked at an unusual angle, with one tire flat, and noticeably dusty. This was not the condition it had been in one week earlier, when the grandparents had last driven by. No one answered when they knocked on the door. Decker's grandparents called Loudoun County police and reported her missing. Investigators found that Decker had not used her bank accounts or cell phone since the last day she was seen, nor had she reported to work or attended her classes. They initially focused on Emile and Roldan, since both of them might have had a motive to harm Decker due to the love triangle they were involved in. With the help of the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), they were able to reach Emile at his remote post in Afghanistan and talk to him on the phone. Later they were able to have him return to the U.S., where he spoke with police at length and took a polygraph test. Roldan had moved out of the apartment shortly after Decker's disappearance, since the lease had expired, and gone to live with his mother in Centreville. He told police that he had just assumed that she had gone back to live with her family when she failed to return. But investigators became more interested in him when they learned that he had a prior criminal record, including one arrest for identity theft and later convictions for public intoxication and destruction of property after a 2006 incident where he smashed a woman's car window. He also reportedly gave them inconsistent answers to questions about when he had seen the Hyundai parked outside the apartment. In March, police searched a field near the apartment complex. They obtained a search warrant for Roldan's current residence, specifying murder as the possible criminal offense on the affidavits. Among the items seized for forensic examination were several cell phones, a laptop computer and some documents. However, police were not able to develop any evidence from this material that might have helped them locate Decker. Roldan later stopped cooperating with the investigation; he has subsequently been described by law enforcement as a person of interest. Emile later obtained a divorce from his missing wife. It has since been reported that he will no longer talk with investigators unless his lawyer, who says his client has nothing to hide, is also present. No record was ever found suggesting that Decker had given birth by her expected due date later that summer, although Loudoun County police distributed to the public pictures of what she might look like near the end of a pregnancy. \\"We feel we have probably interviewed folks in this investigation already that probably have information that we would like to have and have been reluctant to hand that information over yet,\\" Sheriff Steve Simpson told a local newspaper later in 2011. \\"So, we're hopeful that as the days go by that they'll realize that if they have information, no matter how insignificant they think it is, they will give it to us.\\" A year later, Roldan made his only public statements on the case, through his attorney. \\"My client remains hopeful and prays daily that Bethany will come home,\\" said Andi Geloo on his behalf. She said he had cooperated with investigators. \\"He has complete confidence they're working hard on the case.\\" In late 2012, the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared visited the area to produce a segment on the case. Producers interviewed Decker's friends and family, newspaper reporters who had covered the story, and law enforcement. One of the journalists interviewed speculated that the show was interested in the case because Decker was pregnant at the time of her disappearance, and involved in a love triangle, \\"so there are a couple of ways this could go.\\" The episode aired at the end of November. On the third anniversary of Bethany's disappearance, Nelson challenged Roldan to take a polygraph test. \\"I would like to hear what happened,\\" she told Washington-area news radio station WTOP-FM. \\"I'd like him to join the polygraph list like the rest of us did. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about.\\" In response, Geloo repeated that Roldan had answered all questions he was asked during the original investigation and was innocent of any crime that may have been committed. 2014 Roldan arrest and trial Roldan remained in northern Virginia for several years after Decker's disappearance. In 2014 he began another relationship with Vickey Willoughby, a woman he met in a Manassas restaurant. She said that Roldan later grew controlling, and that she attempted to flee the relationship by moving to Pinehurst, North Carolina, a few months later, but Roldan found out and followed her there. Their relationship turned violent. During an argument at the house in November, Willoughby pulled out a handgun she had hidden in the living room to protect herself. She was able to shoot Roldan twice, although he continued to struggle, and eventually gained control of the gun himself, shooting Willoughby three times, once in the head. Both survived, although Willoughby lost one of her eyes to the head wound. She was not charged since investigators believed she had been acting in self-defense; he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a female and discharging a firearm in an occupied dwelling. After being released from the hospital, he was taken to Moore County jail and held on $1 million bail. Detectives from Loudoun County visited Roldan in jail to ask if he was now interested in speaking with them about Bethany's disappearance again; he referred them to his attorney. In April 2015, he was additionally charged with attempted murder over the incident with Willoughby. His attorney said he intended to plead not guilty to the charges. Shortly afterwards, Willoughby appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil devoted to the Decker case, and she said that Roldan had told her, during their fight the previous November, he could \\"make people disappear.\\" In May 2016, after some of the evidence in the case had been suppressed, Roldan accepted a plea bargain from prosecutors. He pled guilty to two felony assault charges and was sentenced to six to eight years in prison. After his sentence is completed, Immigration and Customs Enforcement will begin deportation proceedings against him.

Considered similar to the telephone game, it was created by Jeremiah Freyholtz (aka \\"Reed\\") and released as an early beta on March 26, 2012. The game is currently owned by Freyholtz's company Blue Flame Labs, which also owns MobyGames. Gameplay Drawception is a combination of drawing with telephone game rules that is played by 12, 15 or 24 random players (With some exceptions. With specific settings a player can create 6 player games and in the past, there used to be glitched games with hundreds of players). A game begins with a phrase, which is then drawn by a player. That drawing is then described by another player. This process repeats until all players have taken their turn. Once a game has been completed, players are notified and can view the resulting chain of drawings and descriptions. Games typically transform in unexpected ways and end completely different from where they began. Players can optionally purchase cosmetic color palettes and tools from the game's virtual store. They are purchased with ducks, a virtual currency that they get from other players or with microtransactions, which, once made, gives the player access to Drawception Gold, which gives the ability to create Draw First games and award ducks to others as a way to reward helpful players.  Reception  Drawception has often been compared to games like Draw Something or Draw My Thing, and is noted to \\"combine the weird Pictionary-style guessing of Draw Something with the weird-to-weirder design of a game of Telephone\\". It has also been compared to Broken Picture Telephone, an earlier online game that had been shut down.http://www.instantfundas.com/2012/04/drawception- humorous-game-based-on.html The game has been recommended by publications such as Rock Paper Shotgun, Kotaku, PC Gamer and personalities such as Felicia Day, Harry Partridge and Jazza.

This timeline of the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge describes the progression of events leading up to, during, and after the occupation. The 2016 event played out over several weeks of public statements, occupying activity, and rallies. Prelude (December 2015January 2, 2016) Harney County. Ranchers must pay fees for their cattle to graze on federal lands. Safeway parking lot in Burns, Oregon where participants gathered prior to the occupation. Ammon Bundy, the leader of a group now calling themselves Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, said he began leading the occupation after receiving a divine message ordering him to do so. By early December 2015, Ammon Bundy and Ryan Payne had set up residence in Burns, Oregon. The same month, they organized a meeting at the Harney County Fairgrounds to rally support for their efforts. At the meeting, a \\"committee of safety\\" was organized to orchestrate direct action against the sentences of Dwight and Steven Hammond, the central figures of a case of arson on federal land. According to that group's website, the Harney County Committee of Safety considers itself \\"a governmental body established by the people in the absence of the ability of the existing government to provide for the needs and protection of civilized society\\" (during the American Revolution, committees of safety were shadow governments organized to usurp authority from colonial administrators). On December 30, 2015, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) staff members at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (MNWR) were dismissed early from work. With tensions rising in nearby Burns, supervisors left staff with the final instruction not to return to the refuge unless explicitly instructed. Meanwhile, some residents of Burns reported harassment and intimidation by private U.S. militia members. According to the spouses and children of several federal employees and local police, they had been followed home or to school by vehicles with out-of-state license plates. On January 1, 2016, a privately organized public forum held at the Harney County Fairgrounds was attended by about 60 local residents and members of militias. A Burns-area resident who organized the event described it as an opportunity to defuse tensions that had been simmering between locals and out-of-town militia in the preceding days. According to press accounts, the event lasted about two hours and \\"shifted from sometimes profanity-laden declarations to agreements the Hammonds had been too harshly treated and that a peaceful rally might do some good.\\" At noon on January 2, a rally of about 300 gathered in the parking lot of a Safeway supermarket in Burns, organized by the Pacific Patriots Network (PPN), a militia umbrella organization that includes the 3 Percenters of Idaho. Following 40 minutes of speeches, the crowd marched one mile to the home of Dwight and Steven Hammond, stopping briefly en route to protest outside the sheriff's office. The crowd then returned to the same Safeway and broke up, the entire march lasting approximately ninety minutes. According to KOIN, the CBS-affiliated television station in Portland, Oregon, there was \\"no visible police presence at any point.\\" First week=Initial occupation (January 2)= Jon Ritzheimer, pictured here in May 2015, was identified as one of the leaders of the militant occupation. Notice posting on the MNWR's website stating its closure \\"until further notice.\\" Before the protest crowd broke up, Ammon Bundy announced to the crowd his plan to occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, and he encouraged people to join him. His announcement surprised a PPN rally organizer, who later stated he felt betrayed. Ammon and Ryan Bundy‚Äîalong with armed associates‚Äîseparated from the crowd and proceeded to the refuge headquarters, located south of Burns. The militants settled into the refuge and set up defensive positions. There, they began occupying unstaffed buildings on the property and set up a roadblock on an access road. In a video posted to his Facebook page, Ammon Bundy called on supporters to converge on the facility which he described as \\"the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the Hammonds.\\" According to The Oregonian, Ryan Bundy stated that the militant group wants the Hammonds to be released and for the federal government of the United States to relinquish control of the Malheur National Forest. Right before the occupation began, the militants notified the Harney County Sheriff's Office and also contacted a utility company with the intention of taking over the refuge's electric and other services, according to a motion to dismiss and memorandum filed by Ammon Bundy's lawyers on May 9. At 4:02 p.m. on January 2, the official Facebook page of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge posted an update that read: \\"The Refuge will be CLOSED until further notice.\\" The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which operates the MNWR, said that all of its staff were safe and the refuge was closed until further notice. The Bureau of Land Management announced that its office in Burns would be closed until further notice. As of January 2, the militia leaders claimed to have 150 armed personnel available at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. A reporter personally witnessed \\"no more than a dozen\\" potential combatants. A separate report by public broadcasting network Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) put the number of the militants at the MNWR at \\"between six and 12.\\" In a statement posted to the Facebook page of the 3 Percenters of Idaho (one of the militias identified by media as involved in the takeover), the group disclaimed involvement, stating that the seizure was \\"carried out by a small group of persons who chose to carry out this takeover after the rally.\\" The Harney County Sheriff's Office initially reported that the Oregon State Police (OSP) was \\"handling the incident.\\" At the same time, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said the agency was \\"aware\\" of the situation. Later that same day, The Guardian observed that there was no visible law enforcement presence in the area. Authorities had not approached the refuge or blocked access to it. Maureen Peltier, a soldier with the Washington Army National Guard who traveled to Burns to participate in the protest, reported to media on January 3 that the militias who had seized control of the MNWR were in high spirits and had \\"a good security team.\\" Peltier also said that the militants were moving children onto the MNWR grounds and had called upon like-minded persons to join them. The leader of the occupation, Ammon Bundy, and some other Oregon militants are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and have cited the Mormon scripture as justification for defying government authority. One member of the group told the media that his name is \\"Captain Moroni,\\" a reference to a heroic warrior figure in the Book of Mormon. After the occupation began, the LDS Church issued a statement strongly condemning the seizure and stated that the armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis. Story originally titled, \\"Why the Oregon occupiers are citing the Book of Mormon's 'military stud muffin'\\". The event was connected with the lengthy and complex history of conflict between Mormons and the federal government; Alex Beam describes the Bundys as \\"Mormon religious fanatics.\\" =January 3= USGS satellite image of the MNWR headquarters complex is labeled to show key locations referenced in news reports of the militia occupation: (1) fire lookout used by militants as watch tower, (2) MNWR offices used as headquarters building, (3) residential buildings used by militants as barracks and canteen. At 11:00 a.m. on January 3, Ammon Bundy called a press conference at the MNWR headquarters building. During the conference, Bundy said the ultimate goal of the militants was to \\"get the economics here in the county revived\\" for logging and outdoor recreation, and claimed that they were being supplied by area residents. Despite the smaller estimates of militia at the refuge in early press reports, a reporter from The Oregonian who attended the press conference said he believed there were roughly 20 to 25 people present and that the militants had deployed into defensive positions with elements manning a roadblock, guarding the headquarters entry, and stationed in a fire lookout usually used to watch for forest fires. Additional militiamen occupied the facility's buildings. Later that day, Harney County Sheriff David M. Ward issued a statement asking residents to avoid the scene and saying that the militants aimed to overthrow the government. He explained, \\"These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives, to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.\\" The following day, Ward said at a press conference: > I want to directly address the people at the wildlife refuge: You said you > were here to help the citizens of Harney County. That help ended when a > peaceful protest became an armed and unlawful protest. The Hammonds have > turned themselves in. It is time for you to leave our community. Go home, be > with your own families and end this peacefully. On the evening of January 3, Oregon State Police officials announced that a multi-agency command post would be established the following day to coordinate a response to the situation. The command post was ultimately set up at Lincoln Junior High School in Burns, which had been closed as part of a district-wide school shutdown. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that he had been briefed by the special agent in charge of the Portland, Oregon, FBI field office and said that federal, state, and local law enforcement were monitoring the situation in detail. =January 4= On January 4, the FBI assumed the lead role in the investigation and announced that it was working with local and state authorities to seek \\"a peaceful resolution to the situation.\\" The statement also read: \\"Due to safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved, we will not be releasing any specifics with regards to the law enforcement response.\\" Revised article published January 5, 2016, with title, \\"Oregon Protesters Vow to Dig In Even as Their Heroes Surrender\\", by Alexander Smith, Alex Johnson, Joe Fryer and Elisha Fieldstadt. It was later announced by Sheriff David Ward that the Harney County Court had officially appealed for police reinforcements from the sheriffs of neighboring counties. Meanwhile, media reported that the entrance gates to Burns Municipal Airport had been blocked by the Oregon State Police using patrol cars and armored vehicles. Despite the increased presence in and around Burns, by the end of the day on January 4, media noted that no overt police presence was visible in the between the town and Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters, seemingly underscoring the cautious approach authorities sought to take. In taking a cautious approach, federal authorities were thought to \\"be mindful of prior clashes with people who did not recognize government authority,\\" such as the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993. These events \\"ended in bloodshed and became rallying cries for antigovernment militants,\\" in contrast to similar incidents which ended peacefully, such as the 1996 standoff with the Montana Freemen, which was resolved by extended negotiations leading to the group's surrender. \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2016, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Occupying Federal Land, to Little Response.\\" Steven E. Grasty, the judge-executive of Harney County, emailed Ammon Bundy requesting that he leave Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. According to Grasty, he received \\"roughly 100 'F you'\\" emails in reply. On January 4, the militants announced a formal name for their group, Citizens for Constitutional Freedom. At 1:37 p.m. the same day, Dwight and Steven Hammond voluntarily reported to Terminal Island FCI in California to begin serving the remaining four years of their prison sentences. In an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting, Ammon Bundy's brother, Ryan, said that he and the other militants would leave the property \\"if the county people tell us to.\\" Following the interview, Sheriff David Ward issued a statement requesting the Bundys and others to leave. In response, Ryan Bundy said he wasn't convinced Ward spoke for all of the people in the county. In a public meeting held on January 6 at the Harney County Fairgrounds, nearly every attending person, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting, raised their hands on a question asking if the militants should leave. Ward then announced he would be willing to provide passage to the militants to the county line if they would depart voluntarily. All schools in Harney County closed on January 4 as a safety precaution taken by the local school district. On January 5, the county sheriff's office announced it would host a community meeting to \\"discuss safety concerns and the disruptions\\" on the next day. =January 5‚Äì7= On January 5, The Guardian, quoting a confidential federal government source, reported that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was preparing to cut power and telephone lines to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, while authorities would seal roads leading to the MNWR headquarters compound. Temperatures in Harney County at the time were well below freezing and the move would be designed to flush out the militants. Speaking of a potential police siege, Ammon Bundy said militants were \\"ready and waiting\\" and, in response to the reports, the group began making preparations to repel a potential attack, including moving logs and construction equipment across access roads to the refuge. An Oregon Public Broadcasting report later discredited The Guardians story and the militants \\"stood down\\" from a higher state of readiness. Sheriff David Ward, meanwhile, told reporters that steps were underway to break the occupation and that the measures authorities were taking would \\"not be visible to the public.\\" Ward also reported law enforcement personnel from nine Oregon counties had begun converging to Harney County in response to the Harney County Court's plea for help, but that they would be used to bolster courthouse security and increase the visible police presence in populated areas, rather than respond to the situation at the MNWR. Among the agencies to send personnel were the sheriffs of Wasco, Clackamas, Marion, Deschutes, Crook, Umatilla, Multnomah, Baker, and Linn Counties, along with the Burns Paiute Tribal Police. The sheriffs of Benton and Yamhill Counties both declined a request to deploy some of their deputies to Harney County due to what they described as existing manpower shortages. Ward assured residents on January 4 that deputies from outside the county would not \\"harass the good citizens of Harney County\\" and called on residents at a community meeting at the Harney County Fairgrounds on January 6 to form a \\"united front.\\" In an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting on January 5, he said that any resident providing supplies to the militants would only be \\"prolonging the situation.\\" Two Reuters reporters spent the night of January 5 with the militants at the refuge headquarters. They found that Ammon and Ryan Bundy had moved into the office of a federal biologist. The brothers told the reporters that the biologist would be allowed access to the office, but only to retrieve her personal belongings. Regarding the biologist's work, Ryan Bundy said, \\"She's not here working for the people. She's not benefiting America. She's part of what's destroying America.\\" At his Oregon trial, Ammon Bundy testified that he never intended to prevent federal employees from doing their work at the refuge. The next day, Kenneth Medenbach's \\"hybrid counsel,\\" Matthew Schindler, asked Bundy how the biologist would be able to conduct her work at the refuge if he was using her office and sitting in her chair. Bundy replied, \\"I didn't really think of it.\\" A fistfight erupted at the MNWR on the evening of January 6 when three members of a group calling themselves Veterans on Patrol attempted to enter the headquarters compound. According to the group, they had arrived to convince women and children and Ryan Payne to leave. Instead, they were repelled by militants, leaving one member of the Veterans on Patrol with a black eye. On January 7, the Harney Electric Cooperative began disconnecting power to the fire guard station in the MNWR in the community of Frenchglen. According to officials, the move was done to prevent militants from relocating to other sites within the refuge. Later that day, Sheriff David Ward, accompanied by the Sheriff of Malheur County, Oregon, and the Sheriff of Tillamook County, Oregon, met with Ammon Bundy and Ryan Payne. The meeting occurred in what was described as \\"one of the most remote spots in Oregon,\\" at a location along Lava Bed Road, approximately from the site of the occupation. In the meeting, which lasted between five and ten minutes, Ward repeated his earlier offer to provide safe passage to the militants to the Harney County line. Bundy rejected the offer, saying he and his confederates would hold out until the federal government had surrendered all of its land holdings to local residents. Second week=January 8‚Äì11= Matt Shea, a member of the Washington House of Representatives, was part of a coalition of five out-of-state politicians to meet with the militants on January 9 over objections expressed by local officials. On the morning of January 8, in preparation for a rumored protest that was being organized in Burns, sheriff's deputies began fortifying the county courthouse, including ring-fencing it with concrete barriers. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported \\"heavily armed sheriff's deputies\\" patrolling in the immediate vicinity of the building. Later that day, members of other militias arrived in the area, met with the militants, and asked them to establish a perimeter around the occupied area to avoid a \\"Waco-style situation.\\" A number of other militia and anti-government groups, including multiple armed men, arrived in Burns, the nearest town, and at the refuge. The views of the militants to these new groups were mixed. On January 8, the 3 Percenters of Idaho, an Idaho-based militia who had earlier disclaimed support for the occupation, announced it was sending some of its members to \\"secure a perimeter\\" around the MNWR compound and prevent a repeat of the Waco siege. Bundy welcomed the arrival of the additional militants, saying, \\"If they weren't here, I'd worry [about a law enforcement raid].\\" However, hours after their arrival at the refuge on the morning of January 9, the convoy of new militants from the Pacific Patriots Network, led by Brandon Curtiss, president of the 3 Percenters of Idaho, were asked to leave by Utah attorney Todd MacFarlane, who acted as a mediator. The new militants left the refuge that afternoon. In what The Oregonian characterized as \\"the latest bizarre turn of events,\\" Oregon Representative Dallas Heard traveled to the refuge on January 9 with a coalition of five out-of-state elected officials that included Judy Boyle, Heather Scott and Sage Dixon of Idaho, and Graham Hunt and Matt Shea of the State of Washington. The trip was described by Heard as a \\"fact-finding mission\\" and occurred over the objections of Oregon Representative Cliff Bentz and Harney County Judge Steven Grasty. The coalition returned to Burns after a brief meeting with the militants. By January 10, to the apparent exasperation of local officials, an influx of armed groups and individuals was rotating through Burns, with some declaring they were there to support the armed occupation, others to try to convince the militants to quit, and still others with undefined purposes. At that point in the occupation, militants continued to come and go from the refuge without apparent hindrance, with a militia spokesman noting that the Bundys had left the refuge for a period of time that morning to attend church. Some militants, meanwhile, left the occupation completely. On January 11, schools in the Harney County School District 3 were reopened, albeit with heightened security. Regional offices of the United States Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) remained closed, with those employees who could work remotely doing so; officials said there was no schedule for reopening the offices. Meanwhile, the militants used a government-owned Caterpillar 257B tracked loader to take down an stretch of barbed-wire fence between the refuge and an adjacent ranch, apparently to give the adjacent ranch access to land that had been blocked for years. \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 12, 2016, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Protesters Rip Out Fence at Refuge in Oregon.\\" However, the ranch owners said the militants did not have their permission to take down the fence and have since repaired it. The militants began searching through government documents stored at the complex in order to find alleged proof of government wrongdoing toward local ranchers. The computers on site have also been used by David Fry to make a website for the occupation called Defend Your Base. Fry also claimed that his online comments appearing to sympathize with Adolf Hitler and the Salafi jihadism militant group Islamic State were \\"just a joke.\\" Sheriff David Ward also expressed concern that the militants were intimidating federal employees, including following individuals home and observing them there. =January 12‚Äì15= On January 12, a militant announced that the group will hold a community meeting on January 15 to explain their motives and inform residents when they will leave; however, the group later stated that the meeting would no longer take place. The same day, Bruce Doucette, the owner of a computer repair shop in Denver, Colorado, and a self-proclaimed judge, announced that he would convene a \\"citizens grand jury\\" to charge government officials with various crimes. Present via cell phone during a previous militia rally in Colorado in 2015, Doucette, who has not attended law school nor ever held judicial office, referred The Denver Post to his Facebook page when asked for documentation of his magistracy. Doucette's claims to be a judge are consistent with legal frauds often practiced by the sovereign citizen movement and other anti-government movements. The Southern Poverty Law Center noted a similarity between Doucette's planned trials and the false trials held by the Montana Freemen group in the 1990s. Oregon members of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a sportsmen's group, removed tarps the militants used to cover an official refuge sign. On January 12, members of the group also posted notices to social media that they viewed the occupation as \\"extremist attempts to grab our public lands\\" and predicted that public access to the lands would quickly cease to exist if the militants were successful in their goals. On January 13, the Harney County fire chief, Chris Briels, announced his resignation and decision to take sides with the militants. On January 14, Ammon Bundy announced that the militants planned a longer stay and were reaching out to nearby county sheriffs for support. Michael Ray Emry, speaking for Bruce Doucette, threaten to hold \\"a trial with the redress of grievance\\" against county and other government officials. Oregon Public Broadcasting's John Sepulvado described the threats as an intimidation tactic commonly used by sovereign citizen groups who \\"act in extralegal means. They'll harass those who have been indicted, they'll stalk them, they'll kidnap them in some cases.\\" Harney County Judge Steven Grasty, Sheriff David Ward, and other county officials were served false legal documents by the militants. A man from Hamilton, Montana, was arrested on January 14 on charges of being a \\"felon in possession of a firearm.\\" On January 15, the Oregon State Police made the first arrest of a militant since the occupation began. 62-year-old Kenneth Medenbach, of Crescent, Oregon, was apprehended at the Safeway in Burns while driving a government vehicle stolen from the refuge headquarters; a second vehicle stolen from the refuge was also recovered at the scene. Both vehicles bore altered markings of \\"Harney County Resource Center\\" on the doors, the unofficial name the militants have used for the refuge since shortly after the takeover. Mendenbach previously had a history of troubles with the law, including a prior conviction for illegal occupation of government land that included setting up a makeshift shelter with booby traps and a stockpile of explosives, and was on bail awaiting trial for a similar charge from 2015. It was reported that Medenbach used many legal quirks and filed legal documents in a way consistent with the anti-government sovereign citizen movement ideology. Medenbach had previously told news reporters that \\"I feel the Lord's telling me to possess the land, and I can legally do it, because the U.S. Constitution says the government does not own the land.\\" On January 15, the Oath Keepers anti-government militia group warned of a prospective \\"conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war\\" if the situation declined to violence. Birders and other environmental and outdoors groups protested against the loss of access to the refuge caused by the occupation. Third week=January 16‚Äì18= Militant numbers continued to grow to \\"several dozens\\" according to one report or about 40 in another. On January 16, Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum, an occasional spokesman for the militants, told The Washington Post that \\"[i]t needs to be very clear that these buildings will never, ever return to the federal government,\\" reiterating the group's demands for the federal government to cede ownership of the wildlife refuge. Also on that same day, a group of environmental protesters confronted the militant group. The shouting between the groups became heated after Peter Santilli used a megaphone to shout down the counter-protesters. The militants began to vandalize the property, which local community leaders characterized as an attempt to provoke violent confrontation. On January 17, brothers Jake and Zach Klonoski started a group known as \\"Getting Occupiers of the Historic Oregon Malheur Evicted,\\" or \\"G.O.H.O.M.E.,\\" aiming to restore federal control of the refuge. By the end of that day, they had received over in donations, which they stated will go to organizations such as the Burns Paiute Tribe and Southern Poverty Law Center. =January 19‚Äì22= On January 19, Ammon Bundy and several other militant occupiers appeared unannounced at a community meeting in Burns without addressing the crowd. Attendees of the meeting were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the occupation, with some jeering Bundy to leave. Harney County Judge Steven Grasty directly addressed Bundy with the statement, \\"It is time for you to go home,\\" provoking cheers from the crowd. Others expressed support for the occupation and its goals. An open letter from the staff of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was read to the crowd, marking the first time the staff had broken their silence since the occupation began. The letter was posted to the refuge's official Facebook page; it expressed a reminder to the community that the staff members are part of said community too, that their silence was out of a desire not to make the situation more inflamed, and that the employees hoped to return to their homes and jobs within the community soon. The next morning, Ammon Bundy gave a 90-minute lecture at the refuge firehouse to his supporters describing his views on law and the United States Constitution, which he claims are justification for lending control over land rights from the federal level to the state level. The Harney County Sheriff's Office released a detailed summation of the ongoing troubles with the militants. This included notations of the arrests and citations made to militant members, including a felon in criminal possession of a weapon, armed individuals wearing body armor present under false pretenses who have harassed law enforcement and the media, and a detailed timeline of the group's broken promises to leave when asked to. The statement concluded with a reminder that the group is \\"considered by law enforcement (local, state and federal) to be criminals -- and they need to vacate the refuge.\\" Writer Ursula K. Le Guin penned a letter to the editor condemning The Oregonians apparent bias in covering the events as \\"inaccurate\\" and \\"irresponsible,\\" and referred to the militants as \\"bullyboys\\" and \\"a flock of Right-Winged Loonybirds.\\" A video released by the militants showed them inspecting a locked storage room for archaeological artifacts held in agreement with the Burns Paiute Tribe, an Indian nation in Harney County. The Tribe subsequently delivered a letter demanding that the federal government prosecute the militants under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and a \\"protection against bad men\\" requirement of the tribe's treaty with the U.S. government dating back to 1868. Tribal statements referenced the stored artifacts as well as the group's indiscriminate bulldozing of areas where tribal artifacts may be buried. Another heavily armed group of militants arrived at the compound on January 20, with one militant telling local news, \\"God wants us here.\\" Also on January 20, Oregon Governor Kate Brown appealed to President Barack Obama for a quick resolution to the occupation, writing, \\"I conveyed the harm that is being done to the citizens of Harney County by the occupation, and the necessity that this unlawful occupation end peacefully and without further delay from federal law enforcement.\\" On January 21, Ammon Bundy started negotiations with the FBI. Despite demanding to talk to an agent directly, he had a brief discussion with a negotiator on the phone after showing up unexpectedly at the local airport. He discussed about relinquishing federal government control of the refuge as well as the releases of Dwight and Steven Hammond. He proclaimed that he would not talk about or negotiate a resolution to the militant occupation until the demands were met. Bundy then agreed to meet with the FBI again on the next day. However, when the meeting occurred, Bundy left prematurely after the agent present declined to hold their negotiations in front of the media. Fourth week=January 23‚Äì25= Ammon Bundy speaks to a FBI negotiator via speaker phone at the MNWR on January 21. An online petition was started demanding the government arrest Ammon Bundy, and urged President Barack Obama to bring an end to the occupation. By January 23, over 17,000 signatures had been collected. That same day, about 40 people gathered to protest the occupation about from the refuge. Ongoing problems were reported in the local education system. Also on January 23, the militants hosted a press conference at the refuge, promising news reporters that an Oregon rancher and one from New Mexico would be present to sign papers renouncing their federal grazing permits. Only one rancher, Adrian C. Sewell of Grant County, New Mexico, a convicted felon, renounced his federal grazing permit at the conference. The Oregon rancher was absent. Surprising other law enforcement officials, Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer made a statement saying that freeing the Hammonds \\"would be a start\\" in ending the occupation. On January 25, a man on his way to the occupation was arrested in Hines, Oregon, for driving under the influence of intoxicants and resisting arrest. Armed with a pellet gun, he claimed that he was planning on becoming a bodyguard for Ammon and Ryan Bundy, and also threatened to kill federal agents. =January 26= Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum FBI surveillance footage shows Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum's truck being pursued by police vehicles on U.S. Route 395. In this one-minute excerpt, Finicum encounters a police roadblock and drives into a roadside snowbank. Finicum immediately walks away from his truck, and an OSP officer with a Taser approaches from his right, while OSP officers and FBI agents with rifles position themselves to his left. Finicum moves his hands from over his head to grab his jacket, then turns around to the left to face the way he had walked from. He is then shot three times in the back by two OSP officers. (One-minute excerpt from 26-minute FBI aerial footage.) The FBI report that they recovered a handgun from Finicum's jacket pocket. Around 5:00 p.m. on January 26, state and federal authorities conducted a traffic stop on U.S. Route 395. George T. Bretzing, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Portland field office, later announced that the traffic stop was set up deliberately as an effort to arrest militants, having been set up far from residents to avoid collateral damage. At the traffic stop, Ammon and Ryan Bundy, along with four other militants (Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox, Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum, and Ryan Payne), were stopped while on their way to a community meeting in John Day, Oregon, where Payne was invited by a Canyon City, Oregon, logger to speak. A confrontation between the militants, OSP officers, and FBI agents ensued, leaving one militant, Finicum, dead and Ryan Bundy with a minor wound. Both of the Bundy brothers and the three other militants were arrested, and two other individuals were released without charges. They will face \\"federal felony charges of conspiracy to impede federal officers from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats.\\" 1st pub. January 26, 2016, with the headline \\"Oregon protest leader Ammon Bundy is arrested, says source,\\" by Dana Ford, et al. The charges are per Title 18, United States Code, Section 372, a statute originally created during the American Civil War to facilitate arrests of anti-government conspirators. Reports say that the group were pulled over and everyone present obeyed orders to surrender except Finicum and Ryan Bundy, with shots then being fired. Medical assistance was given to Finicum approximately 10 minutes after the shooting. Prior to the video of the action being released, some of the militants and supporters had claimed that Finicum was cooperating with the police when he was shot. This included a claim by controversial Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore who was not present at the arrest that \\"he was just murdered with his hands up.\\" Cliven D. Bundy, father of Ammon and Ryan Bundy, was quoted as saying that Finicum was \\"sacrificed for a good purpose.\\" Three other militants were arrested in separate actions: Peter Santilli and Joseph O'Shaughnessy were arrested locally, while Jon Ritzheimer was arrested by the FBI in Arizona after handing himself in. =January 27‚Äì28= All eight arrested militants faced a felony charge of conspiracy to impede officers from their official duties by force, intimidation, or threats. All but Ritzheimer were transferred to the Multnomah County jail. Despite these arrests, the occupation at the refuge continued. Early on the morning of January 27, militant Jason Patrick said women and children had left the occupation. Various officials called for the remaining militants to end the occupation. Later in the day on January 27, federal and state police forces moved into the region, formed a perimeter around the refuge, and blocked access to it by setting up roadblocks. One militant still in the compound said that five or six remained inside the refuge. The remaining members debated on what to do next, with some angry about the recent events. They also continued recording a livestream that had been started at some point during the occupation. At one point, a militant proclaimed to viewers that the authorities were coming to kill the occupiers. In one video uploaded to YouTube, Sean Larry Anderson urged supporters to join them inside the refuge and to kill any police officers standing in their way. On January 27, Ammon Bundy, through his lawyer, urged those remaining at the refuge to stand down and go home. Later, several vehicles were seen leaving the refuge before the police perimeter had been set up. Three more militants, including Patrick, turned themselves in at the perimeter on January 27, while five other individuals were allowed to leave the refuge by authorities without incident. Reports stated that five to seven militants remained, \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Jailed Oregon Protest Leader Urges Followers: ‚ÄòPlease Go Home‚Äô.\\" though that number had dropped to four by the following morning, including one woman. One of the remaining militants reported that there is a warrant for the arrest of one of their own; the Associated Press reported that Sean Anderson was facing misdemeanor charges in Wisconsin for resisting arrest and drug possession. The militant added that the others are free to go. However, they refused to do so unless they are all allowed to go freely. They were identified as David Lee Fry of Blanchester, Ohio; husband and wife Sean Larry Anderson and Sandra Lynn Anderson of Riggins, Idaho; and Jeff Wayne Banta of Elko, Nevada. At an initial court appearance, seven of the militants were denied bail as possible flight risks. On January 28, the four remaining militants announced that they are ready to leave the refuge, but still fear arrest. Also on January 28, Lisa Bundy, the wife of Ammon Bundy, reiterated her husband's statement in an audio-recording, urging the remaining militants to follow his wishes and return home to their families. =January 29‚Äì30= As of January 29, the four remaining militants remain in contact with the FBI and reiterated their wish to leave despite their fears of being arrested. The FBI reportedly offered a deal where Sean Anderson, the militant with the arrest warrant placed on him, would be arrested and the others would go free; this was acceptable to Fry and Banta, but not Sandra Anderson, at which point all four made a pact to remain together. The FBI would not comment on possible arrests, but confirmed they are talking to the group. By January 29, the four had ended negotiations with the FBI and were planning to remain at the refuge until their supplies run out. Meanwhile, also on January 29, Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy, Ryan Payne, Jason Patrick, and another jailed militant named Dylan Anderson were all refused bail in a hearing, with Magistrate Judge Stacie Beckerman saying she would not release them while the occupation continues. Bundy's lawyer said that he is not aligned with those remaining in occupation and that he did not recognize Fry's name. The defendants will return to court in the week beginning February 1. Bundy and his wife separately continued to call for the occupation to end. On January 29, the Pacific Patriots Network appealed for those supporting the occupation to come to Burns. They also organized a rally that went through Burns on the night on January 30. Also on January 29, Shawna Cox was bailed. A detention hearing was held on January 30 for seven of the militants arrested on January 26. Also on January 30, the FBI stated that they were continuing negotiations with the four remaining militants. Fifth week=January 31‚ÄìFebruary 2= By January 31, FBI agents have scrutinized social media postings, interviews, and online talk shows that have been made during the occupation since its beginning. The four remaining militants claimed that federal authorities have shut down their ability to communicate with the outside world, including by locking down their ability to make or receive mobile phone calls, an action later confirmed by the FBI. Ammon Bundy repeated his calls for them to surrender. However, the militants were still able to maintain contact with Oregon Public Broadcasting using David Fry's personal cell phone. The 3 Percenters of Idaho planned a protest rally at the Harney County Courthouse on February 1 in support of the remaining militants. The rally saw around 200 demonstrators in Burns, some from out of town, in support of the occupation, but also a counter-demonstration of about 300 against the occupation. In Bunkerville, Nevada, Cliven Bundy reacted to his son Ammon's call for the remaining militants to stand down and return home by sending a letter to Sheriff David Ward, dated February 1. Governor Kate Brown and President Barack Obama each received a carbon copy, and another copy was posted on his Facebook page. The letter informed Ward that the militants will retain possession of the refuge. Bundy writes, \\"This is notice that We the People of Harney County and also We the People of the citizens of the United States DO GIVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL RETAIN POSSESSION OF THE HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER.\\" Bundy also demanded that federal and state police leave Harney County and that a Harney County sheriff guard post be placed at the entrance road leading to the refuge to stop anyone from entering or exiting for the time being. On February 2, through his lawyers, Ammon repeated his call for the four remaining militants at the refuge to return home, saying, \\"Because of the restrictions of solitary confinement for 23 hours per day, I have not been able to speak to my father. I am requesting that the four remaining protesters go home now so their lives are not taken....\\" =February 3‚Äì6= On February 3, the militants' line of communication with OPB was cut. At 2:15 p.m. that same day, the network received a call from a blocked number, informing them about the situation and saying that the four militants were safe. The caller turned down multiple requests of identification, explaining that doing so would \\"compromise ongoing negotiations between the FBI and the remaining militants.\\" On February 6, police added a lighted sign on the roadblock, warning that anyone passing it would be subjected to an arrest. Also on February 6, more than 1,000 supporters attended the funeral of Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum in Kanab, Utah, while others rebuilt a razed memorial on U.S. Route 395. About another 100 people led by the 3 Percenters of Idaho rallied at the Idaho Statehouse in the afternoon in honor of Finicum, who they believed was unarmed at the time of his death. Sixth week=February 7‚Äì9= After a week without communication, David Fry was able to reestablish online communications, posting several videos on YouTube and claiming that he managed to find a way around the FBI's lockdown of their communication to the outside world. In one video, he showed a large collection of empty water and soda bottles, which he claimed to be \\"booby traps\\" to protect the remaining militants from the FBI if they breached the refuge. =February 10‚Äì11= At about 4:30 p.m. on February 10, one of the remaining militants rode past the police barricades on an all- terrain vehicle before returning to the refuge at a high rate of speed. As a result, federal authorities began to surround the refuge at around 5:45 p.m. Mike Arnold, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, learned of the escalation from a live feed where the remaining holdouts were talking of murder and asking to speak to Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore. Fiore was informed of the request as she touched down at the Portland International Airport. Meanwhile, Arnold sent text messages to a FBI negotiator saying, \\"Fiore is landing now. Can you get her on the phone with the people at the refuge? ... We can slow this down by offering Michele Fiore to talk to them.\\" Fiore stated on a YouTube livestream with the militants that she would try to mediate the situation. While she talked to the four militants, Arnold worked on getting the FBI on the phone. At 7:38 p.m., a FBI agent told Arnold that Fiore was doing a good job and they should go to Burns. Later that night, it was reported that the remaining members would be turning themselves in to the FBI at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. On February 11, Sean Anderson, Sandra Anderson, Jeff Banta, and David Fry surrendered without incident to the FBI. Fry was the last militant to remain at the refuge before his arrest. The previous night, Cliven Bundy was arrested for events during the 2014 Bundy standoff, after he flew into Portland to support Fry, Banta, and the Andersons. Post-occupation The Oregon State Police received death threats following Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum's shooting by one of its officers. =Further arrests= The final arrest of the 26 militants indicted for felony conspiracy, was of Travis Cox, and took place on April 12 in Cedar City, Utah. A 27th militant, Scott Alan Willingham, was also arrested on March 16. Willingham pleaded guilty to one count of theft of government property on May 12. Michael Ray Emry, who had described himself as being an \\"embedded reporter\\" for the 3 Percenters of Idaho, was arrested by the FBI on May 6 in John Day, Oregon, on federal weapons charges relating to his possession of a stolen fully automatic .50-caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun. Willingham told The Oregonian that Emry spent time at the refuge for media purposes and to share his expertise with weapons, and supplied another militant at the refuge with a semi-automatic AK-47 rifle. =FBI investigation of scene and damage to refuge= During the occupation the militants illegally dug a new road using a government-owned excavator, expanded a parking lot, dug trenches, destroyed part of a USFWS-owned fence, and removed security cameras; the full extent of the damage is not yet known. In a court filing in February 2016, federal prosecutors said that the FBI had discovered \\"significant amounts of human feces\\" at \\"two large trenches and an improvised road on or adjacent to grounds containing sensitive artifacts\\" of the Burns Paiute Tribe. A USFWS spokesperson said that the damage risked \\"the destruction and desecration of culturally significant Native American sites\\" and called it \\"disgusting, ghoulish behavior.\\" The Burns Paiute Tribe condemned the damage. Two of the militants, Sean Larry Anderson and Jake Edward Ryan, were subsequently indicted for \\"depredation of government property,\\" an offense that carries a potential ten-year jail sentence. A group of 600 volunteers signed up to restore the refuge, after the Oregon Natural Desert Association sought assistance. The FBI's Art Crime Team has conducted an archaeological field assessment to determine if the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act or the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 were violated; additional charges may result if so. Following the surrender of the last militants, the FBI labeled the entire refuge a crime scene and canvassed the buildings in search of explosives and any previously existing hazardous materials. A collection of firearms and explosives were found inside the refuge. The FBI also found evidence that the militants used a boat launch area, about northeast of the refuge, for firearms training. At the boat launch area, investigators recovered about 1,685 spent shell casings. The refuge remained closed after the FBI left the site in late February, with the entrance road blocked off from public access by armed officers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge's manager described it as \\"one big mess\\" at the end of February. Although he and 15 other employees at the refuge were able to return to their jobs at the end of February, they found that while there had not been much structural damage to the buildings, there had been a great deal of disruption to files, heavy equipment and fittings, in addition to the problems caused by a lengthy break in the maintenance of the refuge's infrastructure. There was no contingency funding for the repairs and rehabilitation needed, and it was not thought likely that the refuge would be able to reopen to the public for several months. =Costs= According to an analysis by The Oregonian, the occupation \\"cost taxpayers at least $3.3 million to cover the massive police response, a week of shuttered schools and a long list of supplies ranging from food to flashlight batteries,\\" and that number is almost certainly an underestimate. Most of the costs was for around- the-clock police work: the Oregon State Police spent million on wages, overtime, lodging, and fuel; while an additional was paid for help from other police and government agencies from outside Harney County. Harney County, its schools, and the municipalities of Burns and Hines spent . The million figure also includes wages paid to employees who could not work because of the occupation, such as for about 120 BLM employees whose offices were closed. The figure of the costs does not include additional costs, such as lost time in the field, delayed or canceled BLM projects, or added demand for food and services at local nonprofits, such as the Harney County Senior Center. =Investigation of FBI shots fired during Finicum's death= Investigators with the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office, assigned to process the scene of Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum's shooting, were accounting for the two known sets of shots fired by the OSP officers during the event (the shots that killed Finicum, and the earlier shots that struck his vehicle) when they discovered a bullet that struck the roof of the truck at a different trajectory. After ascertaining the bullet's existence with cell phone video taken by Shawna Cox, investigators modeled the bullet's trajectory using computers, and determined that the bullet was fired from the direction where two FBI agents were standing. They later determined that an operator with a FBI Hostage Rescue Team fired twice at Finicum, missing and injuring militant Ryan Bundy in the process. The agent, whose identity was withheld, was under investigation, along with four other FBI agents who were suspected of attempting to conceal evidence of the gunshots. They reportedly told investigators that none of them fired a shot during the incident. During initial processing of the scene, rifle casings ejected from the weapon fired by the FBI agent were reported not present. However, an OSP officer later described seeing two rifle casings at the scene near where the FBI agents were positioned. FBI aerial surveillance video shows agents searching the area, then huddling together before breaking up moments later, with one agent bending over twice to pick up an unknown object. Law enforcement officials began the investigation into the gunshots after watching the full surveillance video and suspecting something was amiss. Two FBI pickup trucks were searched for rifle casings, but none were found, while at least three OSP officers were interrogated about their initial processing of the scene. On March 8, officials revealed their findings to the public. The U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into the conduct of the agents.

The text is attached to the Rig Veda, and is one of the 20 Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads. It is a short text and notable for its distilled, aphoristic presentation with metaphors and allegories. The Nirvana Upanishad describes the sannyasi (renouncer), his character and his state of existence as he leads the monastic life in the Hindu Ashrama tradition. The Upanishad is notable for not mentioning any rites of passage, qualifications or discussion of the sannyasi's life before renunciation. It just describes the Sannyasi, his external state, his inner state. The Upanishad asserts that the life of the sannyasi is of reflection, not rituals, dedicated to Jnana-kanda (knowledge section of the Vedas), finding home when he is in union with truth and perfection. Self-knowledge is his journey and destination, a solitary place his monastery of bliss. History The composition date or author of Nirvana Upanishad is unknown, but its sutra-style suggests that it originated in the sutra text period (final centuries of the 1st-millennium BC), before it was compiled and classified as an Upanishad. This text was likely composed in the centuries around the start of common era. Gavin Flood dates the Sannyasa Upanishads like Nirvana Upanishad to the first few centuries of the common era. This text has been sometimes titled as Nirvanopanishad in manuscripts.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 439 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 47. Contents The Nirvana Upanishad is written in Sutra-style. A Sutra means \\"string, thread\\",Monier Monier-Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Article for Sutra, page 1241 and in Indian literary traditions, it also refers to an aphorism or a collection of aphorisms in the form of a condensed manual or text. Each sutra is like a theorem distilled into few words or syllables, around which \\"teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar or any field of knowledge\\" can be woven.M Winternitz (2010 Reprint), A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 249 This Upanishad deals with Vedanta philosophy. The aphoristic style implies that the text can be interpreted with multiple meanings, is full of metaphors and allegories, and its sutras implicitly refer to Hindu scriptures. \\"The sky is his belief\\" in its third sutra for example, states Patrick Olivelle, is a metaphor for consciousness, spanning everything visible yet indivisible; it also means that the sannyasi is not enslaved to any specific doctrine but instead follows his own consciousness, his own conception of the absolute. The text asserts that the life of the sannyasi is of reflection, not rituals. Jnana-kanda (knowledge section of the Vedas) is the scripture of the sannyasi, states the Upanishad, and not the section on Karma-kanda (rituals section of the Vedas). He is marked by fearlessness, fortitude, equanimity, a conduct that is both respectful of others and his own wishes, he does not revile others nor find faults in others, states the Upanishad. The verse 36‚Äì37 of the text asserts a position reverse of the Sunyavada of Buddhism, states Olivelle, where the Hindu sannyasi does not accept void-emptiness as ultimate reality, but believes Atman-Brahman as the ultimate reality. The primordial Brahman, states sutra 40 of the text, is self-knowledge for the renouncer. The sannyasi finds home when he is in union with truth and perfection, states sutra 38 of the text. Self-knowledge is his journey and destination. His state is of an entranced mind, solitude his monastery. He is virtuous, he knows no fear, no delusions, no grief, no anger, no selfishness, no egotism. He contemplates on the true nature, silence is his mantra, he conducts himself as he pleases, his own nature is his liberation, translates Olivelle. Reception The text is obscure, states T.M.P. Mahadevan, while Paul Deussen states the text may have been a memory aid that went with the glossary sections of the 108 Upanishads, namely the Sarvasara Upanishad and Niralamba Upanishad. Patrick Olivelle concurs with Deussen and considers this Upanishad as an early text in the Sutra tradition of Hinduism. The text, state Olivelle, has a distinct Advaita Vedanta of Hindu philosophy flavor, like most Sannyasa Upanishads, but this may be because major Hindu monasteries of 1st millennium AD belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition. Buddhadasa, a Thai Buddhist, in a commentary on Nirvana between two Indian religions, states that the Upanishad's view is that an eternal, uncreated Atman exists. In contrast, states Buddhadasa, there is no Atman terminology in Buddhism.

It was nominated for a Philip K. Dick Award, a Locus Award and a Lambda Literary Award. Setting In the future, control of the preservation of interplanetary natural resources has been given over to ecological artificial intelligences called the Governors, who enforce carbon neutrality with strict population controls and energy consumption regulations, and even calculated genocide called \\"assessment\\". The parliament of the fascistic Old Earth Colonial Coalition, ruthless in its own support of the AIs, serves as a buffer to prevent unnecessary disruption to humanity. With colonists having left Earth generations before seeking freedom from these restrictions, the Coalition has now, for decades, been subsuming autonomous worlds back under its control. One of these is New Amazonia, a lush planet on which a matriarchal, primarily lesbian society has risen up amidst abandoned alien technology that includes a seemingly inexhaustible power supply. The Amazonian women are aggressive and warlike, but also pragmatic and defensive of their freedom from the male- dominated Coalition that seeks to conquer them. Distrustful of male aggression, they subjugate their men, a minority they seem to tolerate solely for reproduction and labor. Plot A diplomatic mission to the matriarchal planet New Amazonia reunites ex-lovers Vincent Katherinessen and Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones after a separation of 17 years. Arriving in the capital city of Penthesilea, the men are ostensibly repatriating looted artwork, but in truth the ambassador-spies have been tasked with obtaining the Amazonians' secret energy technology by any means necessary, and doing what they can to facilitate a Coalition conquest. However, both Vincent (a master of observation) and Angelo (a trained liar and fighter) each have hidden plans to undermine their own mission. Meanwhile, multiple factions among the Amazonians are engaged in covert political intrigues rooted in the gender dynamics of their society. Characters * Vincent Katherinessen, OECC senior diplomat, originally from the planet Ur * Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones, Vincent's attach√© and former partner, born on Old Earth * Lesa Praetoria, deputy chief of Security Directorate of New Amazonia * Claude Singapore, Prime Minister of New Amazonia * Maiju Montevideo, Claude's wife * Elena Pretoria, Lesa's mother * Katya Pretoria, Lesa's daughter * Julian Pretoria, Lesa's son * Robert, the father of Lesa's children * Kii, an alien intelligence residing in Penthesilea Themes Annalee Newitz of io9 explained that, faced with strict population controls, the Earth-centric humans in Carnival have become obsessed with reproduction, and have outlawed homosexuality as directly opposing this function. She wrote that \\"Bear's idea that an eco-regime like this would breed conservatism rather than progressivism is really quite smart\\", and praised the author's \\"careful attention to how ideologies might evolve over time\\". Paul Kincaid of SF Site noted that Vincent and Michelangelo \\"are homosexuals from a world whose regressive and repressive mores mean that this could get them killed, but for the fact that they are exceptionally well-skilled at their job and also well-practiced in deception\\". Of the New Amazonian civilization, Newitz wrote: Explaining that the Amazonian women subjugate their men as a means to diffuse the potential of male aggression, Kincaid compared the matriarchal premise to \\"the feminist science fiction of twenty or perhaps thirty years ago\\". Joe Tokamak of The Internet Review of Science Fiction called the novel \\"a fantasy of societal alternatives reminiscent of the sixties or seventies\\" and yet \\"fresh, sophisticated material\\". He also noted how Bear's contrast of the societal differences between the New Amazonians and their visitors initiates conflict that evolves as the characters interact. Critical reception In 2007, Carnival was nominated for a Philip K. Dick Award, a Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and a Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror. Newitz wrote that the novel \\"manages to do what so few SF novels can ... it offers an intriguing, intellectually-rewarding glimpse at one human possible future while also telling a rip-roaring yarn.\\" Liz Bourke of Tor.com called it \\"a vivid book, vital and alive\\", and cited it as her favorite of Bear's science fiction novels. Kincaid wrote, \\"Strip away the sexual politics overlaid on the story, which add complexity to the plot but not necessarily depth to the novel, and this is a book that could have come straight from the so-called golden age.\\" Though suggesting that \\"there are too many layers of betrayal and deception for a book of this length\\", Kincaid wrote that \\"Bear keeps the whole thing moving at a brisk and satisfying pace ... this is exactly the sort of vivid, pacy novel that used to make science fiction such an exciting genre to read.\\" Writing for SF Crowsnest, Tomas L. Martin called the characters \\"interesting and very dynamic\\", the galactic politics \\"top-notch\\" and some of the technology \\"breathtaking\\", while noting that the novel occasionally \\"gets a little bogged down and hard to navigate\\". Tokamak praised the \\"intriguing, three dimensional characters\\" and the \\"compelling and complex plot that gradually gets its hooks into the reader and doesn't let go\\", while calling the resolution \\"hasty and disconnected from all the misery the characters go through to get there\\".

It was built in 1883. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The building was constructed for Edmund Harris Thornburgh Plant, mill owner, company director of a number of mines in the Charters Towers-Ravenswood area and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council from 1905 to 1922. After construction in 1883 it was occupied by Pollard's Music Store and by the Royal Bank of Queensland from 1890. In 1892 Rooney & Co., the leading builders of the region, took out a lease and traded from there for the next 49 years. In 1917 Rooney Ltd purchased the building and in 1928 modernised the ground floor as a large furniture showroom. The produce firm of Samuel Allen & Sons Ltd, established in the city in 1872, purchased the site in 1953. In 1979 the windows on the first floor were replaced with aluminium and the ground floor facade altered to accommodate three shops or restaurants. In 2016, an Italian restaurant is operating from the ground floor.  Description  The Rooney Building, constructed in 1883, has a plain symmetrical facade with some classical features such as arched windows and a decorative parapet which conceals the corrugated iron roof. The ground floor facade of this cement-rendered brick building has been altered and the original awning replaced with one of a modern cantilever design. This floor is now divided into three shops. Aluminium windows have replaced the timber framed windows on the upper level while the interior of the first floor has been renovated to house offices.  Heritage listing  Rooney Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Its importance is enhanced because of the contribution these commercial firms made to the development and consolidation of Townsville in the 1880s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. While this building is representative of commercial structures of the it is also important as a unifying part of the Flinders Street East area.

It covers the life of professional boxer Muhammad Ali. The film tells his story using personal audio recordings Ali made himself during the 1970s. Additionally, interviews of friends, family members, and people associated with professional boxing, combined with archival footage of Ali, are used throughout the movie. Notable appearances in the film include George Foreman, Jim Brown, and Mike Tyson. Overview The film begins with a phone call between Ali and his daughter Hana that took place on November 30, 1979. In the call Ali tells Hana, a young child at the time, that he might fight in one final boxing match. Hana tells him not to do it. The film then transitions to Ali's last professional fight, which took place in 1981, two years later. According to director Clare Lewins, she did not want to cover Ali's entire life in a linear manner, but instead wished to start with his decision to accept that final professional fight. From there, glimpses of Ali's life are shown through archival footage, interviews with friends and family, and many more of Ali's personal audio recordings. Notable periods of his life are covered by interviews with those who knew him best, and others who considered themselves fans and admirers. Through these devices the documentary looks back at Ali's life, beginning with early childhood. Scenes include a retelling of the theft of Ali's bicycle when he was a child. That crime played a key role in his entering the sport of boxing when he was twelve years old. Ali's brother Rahaman states that even from those early teen years Ali felt he would become one of the greatest boxers of all time. Numerous audio clips from various sources featuring Ali's voice are presented throughout the movie. A wide range of moments are covered in these recordings. They include Ali singing with his daughter Hana, his discussions with the White House, and a conversation with a pizza delivery man who stopped by Ali's home. The documentary also focuses on Ali's relationship to the boxing world. Ali's boxing matches with various rivals, including Joe Frazier, George Foreman, and Sonny Liston are discussed. Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson talks about how he aspired to fight at the same level as Ali. George Foreman shares how Ali would tease and taunt him during their boxing matches. Singer Tom Jones talks about his admiration for Ali's boxing skills and persona. Former business manager Gene Kilroy weighs in on several topics. Also interviewed is photographer Carl Fischer, who took photos of Ali for the cover of Esquire. Another topic touched on is Ali's conversion to Islam, including why he changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. That line of exploration also includes Ali's conscientious objector status to the Vietnam War, and his refusal to join the military based on his religious beliefs. Ebony described the film as follows: > I Am Ali shows the rarely seen personal side of a man who outside of > changing the world and moving like a butterfly inside the ring, managed to > bring together a family through phone calls strengthened by blood and > purpose. Reception Of the film, Ali's daughter Hana felt her father would be happy with Lewins' direction of the film, especially the depiction of Ali's \\"loving side.\\" The Chicago Tribune said, \\"At its best, I Am Ali offers something the big-budget biopic Ali could not: casual intimacy.\\" NPR stated, \\"What distinguishes Lewins' entertaining-if-not-terribly-revelatory film from the many Ali documentaries that have come before is its focus on this most public of personalities as a friend and father.\\" The Guardian called the film \\"warm hearted and respectful\\" and a \\"very watchable tribute\\" though it felt it might not live up to other films about Ali.

The aircraft sank over an hour after ditching. Four passengers died, out of 8 crew and 34 passengers. The flight originated from Paris and was destined for Tehran, including stopovers in Rome and Beirut, with the accident occurring on the Rome-Beirut leg of the journey. The aircraft serving the flight, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, likely experienced a propeller blade failure resulting in strong vibrations causing the No. 3 engine to detach in-flight. Aircraft and crew The aircraft, Lockheed L-749A Constellation, (F-BAZS c/n 2628), which first flew in 1950, had flown for a total of 10,058 hours and was powered by four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines, (type ‚Ññ 749C18BD1). The flight was piloted by captain Raymond Terry (born 1923), and first officer Jacques Steens (born 1923). The remaining six crew included radio operator Ren√© Debiais, flight engineers Christian Dihau and Andr√© Lemaire, and flight attendants Hazera, Fran√ßois Yvon Tinevez and Simone Rospars. Terry had 5,300 flying hours, co- pilot Debiais 5,500 hours and flight attendant Rospars 7,373 hours of flying experience. Flight and accident Flight path of AF152 on August 2‚Äì3, 1953 The scheduled flight AF152 departed from Orly Airport in Paris, France at 18:38 hours on 2 August 1953, destination Tehran, with two planned stopovers in Rome, and Beirut. At 21:25 hours, the airliner landed at Roma-Ciampino Airport and took off at 22:32 hours with 34 passengers including an infant on board for the next stopover at Beirut International Airport. The planned flight path was over Catanzaro, Araxos, Athens, Rhodes and Nicosia. The flight time for the leg was calculated as 4 hours and 52 minutes. At 02:10 hours on 3 August, while cruising at an altitude of about off Rhodes, the No. 3 engine suddenly began to vibrate violently. At 02:15 h, a radio message was sent to Nicosia giving the aircraft's position flying over the coastline of Rhodes. The No. 3 engine soon detached from its mounts, hit and damaged the rear of the fuselage before dropping away. Ongoing vibrations subsequently led to the loss of control on the No. 4 engine. As the aircraft quickly began losing altitude, the flight crew transmitted a three minute long distress signal at 02:22h and decided to make an emergency water landing, avoiding a risky landing in mountainous terrain. They chose a site off the coast of Fethiye in South-Western Turkey after spotting the flashing light of the Kƒ±zƒ±lada Lighthouse. During the descent the flight attendants informed the passengers about the situation, calmed them down and instructed them to put on life jackets. At 02:28, the aircraft ditched into the calm sea flawlessly, about off Kƒ±zƒ±lada in the Gulf of Fethiye approximately from Fethiye. The passengers and the crew promptly evacuated the airplane using the four emergency exits, and initially remained on the wings of the floating aircraft for over an hour before it finally sank. Rescue Lighthouse keeper Durmu≈ü Arƒ±kan noticed the airliner's ditching, however, neither he nor his supervisor could sight it in the pitch-dark night. Only sometime later, with the beginning of twilight, could they see the aircraft and the victims on the sea surface. They rushed to the accident site by boat, rescuing some passengers, including flight attendant Rospars, who held a five-month old infant girl Roxane on her lap, and the baby's mother, to the island shore. Meanwhile, crew members and some passengers tried to swim the distance to the island in order to call for relief. Alerted by the lighthouse keeper, customs officers and fishermen sailed towards the scene, picking survivors on the water. Four elderly passengers of the 42 people on board of the airliner died by drowning. The survivors received clothing, warm food, drink and shelter from residents during their stay in Fethiye. Aftermath At 04:30 the same day, Beirut alerted Air France by telegram of Flight 152's failure to arrive, and asked for a search and rescue operation. At 10:30 the stopover office of Air France in Athens asked Orly Airport for news about F-BAZS. At 17:30 hours, a telegram from the airliner's captain, sent from Fethiye, arrived at Air France stating that 38 people survived the accident. After being informed of the accident, seven officials of the French aviation accident investigation agency Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile arrived at the accident site the next day at 17:00. The investigation lasted almost eight months; the final report was released on 16 March 1954, stating the cause of the accident as \\"the failure of a propeller blade resulting in the separation of the No. 3 engine from the aircraft, and loss of control of the No. 4 engine. The cause of the propeller blade fracture could not be determined.\\" Didier Daurat, Director of Orly Operations Centre, was tasked with shedding light on the cause of propeller blade's failure. The crew, the passengers and the investigators were transported to Rhodes, from where they were flown to Paris four days after the accident. As a consequence of the accident, it was made obligatory to carry liferafts on all flights. In media In 2013, 60 years after the accident, an underwater search operation was undertaken in the Gulf of Fethiye, which led to finding of an aircraft engine, but not the airliner itself. A documentary film about this search was aired by ƒ∞Z TV. The wreckage of the aircraft was discovered by the Turkish Navy in 2018.

It is common to dialects spoken in Shizuoka and Chita Peninsula, but never used in Nagoya city. * -rin or -n is a soft order form and compared to Nagoya style -yaa. -rin is connected to -masu form of ichidan verbs such as yoke taberin \\"eat a lot\\" and are mirin \\"look that\\"; -n is connected to -masu form of godan verbs such as hayaku ikin \\"go quickly\\". Soft order forms of suru \\"do\\" and kuru \\"come\\" irregular verbs are differ from person to person; shirin, serin, sen or shin for suru and korin, kirin or kin for kuru.

The Zero COT commenced in Nigeria on 1 January 2016. The CBN through the Revised Guide to Bank Charges (RGBC) of 1 April 2013, provides gradual steps towards the application of this policy. The guide stipulated a phase-out plan from =N=3 (2013), to =N=2 (2014),to =N=1 (2015) and =N=0 (2016). Also, the policy permits customers to negotiable COT in each of the relevant year subject to the maximum stated in the plan. Central bank Nigeria Overview The Guide to Bank Charges was introduced in 2014 to provide a standardize means of bank charges on all products and services between customers and DMBs in the country. The guide was revised on 1 April 2013 in order to accommodate current developments in banking industry. The guide is the compilation of all charges on all services and products rendered by the DMBs and their applications. The policy was established to boost the lost confidence of Nigerian in banking industry. Financial experts believe, the application of the policy will drag more people into financial net. In January 2016, the monetary regulatory body noticed the persistence in charging the banned charges by the DMBs. This was led to the committee in charged of Bank and Currency in the House of Representative (HOR) to demand for immediate refund of all COT charges from 1 January 2016. Implementation The implementation of Zero COT started in Nigeria on 1 January 2016. This policy was initiated via a circular called RGBC from CBN to all the DMBs in the country on 1 April 2013. The CBN provided a graduating plan which provide for the removal of the COT on all induced debit transactions by the bank to be removed from 2013 thus; =N=3 in 2013 to =N=2 in 2014 and =N=1 in 2015 and zero =N= in 2016. This plan was arranged to provide a soft landing for all the DMBs in order to cushion the effect of one off removal from their Net profit. While the burden suffers by customers by the effect of these charges are removed. The policy had received the backing of many Nigerian financial experts. Mr. Femi Ekundayo, a financial expert and former president of Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) said ‚ÄúThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policy on financial inclusion is to get more people into the financial net‚Äù. House of Representatives and Zero COT The HOR in Nigeria has decided that all COT charged by all DMBs after the deadline stipulated by the RGBC from all customers in the country must be refunded. The house gave a thirty-day ultimatum for the perfection of this motion. A committee on Bank and Currency was organised by the house to look into the implementation of this policy. According to Edward Gyang Pwajok, a house member representing People Democratic Party (PDP) from Plateau, the zero COT policy intended to be used by CBN to boost the economy is not being implemented by the banks because the CBN has not directed that it be implemented.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1878-1879 by C A Ward. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 January 1994.  History  This two-storeyed rendered brick building was erected in 1878-1879 as the Townsville branch of the Queensland National Bank (QNB), on a site acquired by the bank in December 1877. It was erected during the boom which accompanied Townsville's growth in the 1870s as the port for the goldfields centred around Ravenswood and Charters Towers. The QNB, established in Brisbane in 1872 by a group of prominent Queensland businessmen, flourished during the last quarter of the 19th century. In the 1870s and 1880s it was patronised by Sir Thomas McIlwraith and Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer, and for 42 years, from 1879 until 1921, the QNB held the Queensland Government's banking account. Despite financial scandals and collapse in the early 1890s, the QNB contributed substantially to the development of North Queensland, lending generously to mining, pastoral and sugar interests. It was the third bank to establish a branch in Townsville, in a small timber cottage in 1873. In 1875, the QNB purchased a site in Wickham Street, on which larger premises were erected in 1876. This building was destroyed by fire in 1877, following which the bank operated from temporary rented premises until the present Flinders Street building was completed in 1879. Queensland National Bank, Townsville, 1890s The new offices were designed by then colonial architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, who from the late 1870s to the late 1890s designed a substantial number of bank buildings in Queensland for the QNB, the Australian Joint Stock Bank, and the Union Bank. The contractor was Townsville builder CA Ward. Total cost of the new premises, including land, was just over . At the time, it was the most substantial building in Townsville. The ground floor offices comprised a large banking chamber, manager's room, strong room, and stationery store. The manager's accommodation on the first floor consisted of a large drawing room, bedrooms and a bathroom. The dining room was located on the ground floor at the rear, with easy access to the kitchen. Verandahs to both levels at the front and sides, demonstrating what appears to be the first use of elaborately decorative cast-iron balustrading in North Queensland, were an important adaptation to the climate. The building functioned as banking premises for one hundred and three years, first as the QNB, and from 1948 as the National Bank of Australasia Limited, following the merger of the QNB with the NBA in that year. The NBA closed the branch in April 1982, and sold the property in 1983. In 1984 the building was refurbished and re-opened as commercial offices. The principal lessee in the 1980s was the Queensland Tourist Travel Corporation. In 2016, the former bank is used as an antiques and vintage shop.  Description  Queensland National Bank, 1993 The former Queensland National Bank, located on the northern side of Flinders Street Mall, is a two-storeyed rendered masonry building with a hipped corrugated iron roof and classical revival facade. The building is built to the site's front and side boundaries, with the side verandahs being enclosed. The facade, consisting of verandahs to both floors, is divided into three bays. The ground floor features Tuscan Order columns supporting an entablature with cornice, and the first floor features paired Egyptian inspired, Lotus Bud capital, cast iron columns supporting a corrugated iron awning. The arched centre entrance bay projects on both floors, and is surmounted by a gable and both floors have cast iron balustrade, but of a different design. The ground floor has a timber framed glass entrance door with an arched fanlight, with a large sash window on the west and a casement on the east. The first floor has french doors with timber louvred shutters. Each of the side verandahs have been fitted out as a shop at ground level. The first floor has paired timber posts with the rear being enclosed with glass louvres. The rear of the building has a single- storeyed masonry wing, with a corrugated iron gable roof, which has had recent concrete block additions. The east verandah tenancy has a long single-storeyed concrete block addition with a skillion corrugated iron roof. The rear of the site is concreted and used for car parking. Internally, the ground floor has a large front office, with a strongroom, some partitioning, false ceilings, floor vents and two steel columns. Windows onto side verandahs have been enclosed. At the rear, a timber stair with turned balustrade leads to the first floor from a rear foyer which has double timber doors with arched fanlight and sidelights. The rear wing has been refitted and extended to house staff amenities. The first floor contains a kitchen at the rear, large offices opening onto the front and side verandahs, plaster ceilings, painted timber joinery and panelled doors with fanlights.  Heritage listing  The former Queensland National Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 January 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Its location demonstrates the development of Townsville as a port for the Ravenswood and Charters Towers goldfields and as the principal town in North Queensland at that time. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Queensland National Bank, erected in 1878-1879, is a characteristic 1870s regional bank building adapted to a tropical climate, and is one of the few remaining 1870s buildings in Townsville. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The quality of design and composition of classical elements are of considerable aesthetic value, and it is a fine example of the work of Queensland colonial architect FDG Stanley. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is part of the Queensland National Bank's contribution to the development of North Queensland in the last quarter of the 19th century.

Another revised edition was published in 2008.  Biography  Grimes was born into slavery in King George County, Virginia, in 1784. In column 5. His father was Benjamin Grymes, a wealthy plantation owner; Grimes' mother was a slave on a neighboring plantation. During his years of slavery, Grimes was owned by at least ten different masters, in the States of Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia. He worked as a house servant, valet, field worker, stable boy, and coachman. In 1814, at the age of 30, Grimes escaped from slavery by stowing away on a ship that sailed from Savannah, Georgia to New York City. Grimes settled in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a successful barber. His clients included students from nearby Yale College and Litchfield. Grimes' former master tracked him down and demanded that Grimes purchase his freedom with \\"my house and land, all I had,\\" or else face arrest and re-enslavement. Grimes had no choice but to pay, and wrote his memoir in hopes of recovering his finances. Grimes died on August 20, 1865, about 81 years old, in New Haven, Connecticut.

Atanackoviƒá who, encouraged by the ideas of romanticism, changed his name Timotej into Bogoboj for artistic reasons at the age of eighteen.  Biography  Atanackoviƒá was from a very respectable bourgeois family, where Serbian tradition was honoured scrupulously. He started school at an early age in his village. He attended high school at the Gymnasium of Karlovci before pursuing higher studies at the universities of the Hungarian and Austrian capitals. Atanackoviƒá resumed his law studies, which he had begun at universities in Budapest and in Vienna, where he frequented the circle of Serbian romanticists, followers of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá; he was friends with ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá and poet Branko Radiƒçeviƒá. As a result of his participation in the Serbian Movement of 1848 and at the May Assembly in Sremski Karlovci, he was forced to flee to Vienna and later to Paris, from where he travelled throughout France, Switzerland, Germany, England and Italy. He came to Novi Sad in 1851 and worked as a secretary of the Orthodox bishop, Platon Atanackoviƒá. He continued his literary work, which he had started during his studies in Vienna, and in 1852 he returned to Baja, where he opened a law office. He died in 1858 of tuberculosis. He was 32. He posed for a portrait when he was around fourteen, probably at the end of the first years of high school, a child from a respectable merchant family in Baja; the portraitist was either of Austrian or Hungarian origin, but his identity still remains unknown. Atanackoviƒá was painted with a book in his right hand, in a manner customary at the time for portraits of older children who attended school or came from educated families. He was predestined to study law. Neither a child, nor an adult, with a serious expression on his face, but with the size of a child, clothed according to the style of the upper classes, bourgeoisie or nobility (Artist Jovan Popoviƒá painted the portrait of distinguished and ageing Sava Tekelija wearing such clothes), the future lawyer was depicted in a typical, slightly stiff pose, characteristic of a Biedermeier painting. His body and his arms are somewhat disproportionate to his head, but his face is painted carefully, with extraordinary warmth and directness. The details on his clothes - the decorative stripes, the buttons, the folds of his coat, the bow on his shirt - are accentuated in their simplicity to emphasize the importance of the depicted person. \\"Dva idola (1851)\\" made him famous. He suddenly found himself in demand as a novelist of the first order. Today Atanackoviƒá is not looked upon that way by current critics, but then we're living in a different time. His stories are in part autobiographical or based on lives of people he knew: to invent for him was to remember. His stories usually had a foundation in fact and, in addition, his choice of realistic detail within loosely spun plots gave his work an air of verisimilitude. Even so, he achieved his effects by his \\"easy, plain, and familiar language of the common folk,\\" taught him by Karadziƒá and Daniƒçiƒá when he was studying in Vienna for his law degree. Bogoboj Atanackoviƒá brought to the Serbian novel a sense of tragic pessimism expressed with stoic restraint. Nothing in his external circumstances of his life explains this point of view, except for the current events which he witnessed a wrote about both in the guise of his novels, sentimental patriotic stories, and autobiography. He was brought up in Baja, Hungary , and his closeness to simple rural life probably helped him to penetrate to the central motives of existence. After travelling through Western Europe for two years, Atanackovic settled in Novi Sad, preferring to try his hand at writing novels than practicing law. In subsequent novels his world became increasingly one of grim tereenism‚Äîcrass casualty‚Äîequally devoid of divine intent and of materialistic logic. Chance, accident, coincidence determine the outcome of human effort in his case, and the case for most of us. As a novelist and short story writer Bogoboj Atanackoviƒá came to hold definite theories of the purposes and values of fiction, which he set forth in the essays collected after his death in the \\"Collection of the Works by Bogoboj Atanackoviƒá.\\" Legacy On the ground of literary reception of Bogoboj Atanackoviƒá's work, according to Jovan Skerliƒá, it has been found out that he belongs to a group of writers who were at the beginning praised too much, and later on completely disdained. Atanackoviƒá aimed to educate and entertain his readers, and the attitudes he supports in his poetics shows that he was familiar with the contemporary pedagogical teachings. He was writing for the female part of his audience and for the youth. Atanackoviƒá was influenced by Serbian writers of the previous epochs along with his contemporaries, first of all Branko Radiƒçeviƒá, also the contemporary Russian, French, German and Hungarian writers, as well as the oral folk and urban lyrics. In his works he described the events of the 1848-1849 Revolution. His contribution to the development of Serbian literature is seen in abandoning the Vojvodina dialect in accordance with Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's reform of the Serbian language, combining the sentimental and romantic style with the elements of realism in the Serbian prose, also in turning to the themes from contemporary life and including the social aspects into the literature, while in the prose accounts of his travels he used meditative reporter style and the epistle form.

He signed his literary work as Milo≈° Svetiƒá and was an influential figure in the drafting of the Civil and Criminal Code of Serbia in 1844. Serbia is the fourth modern-day European country after France, Austria and the Netherlands to have a codified legal system because of Had≈æiƒá's work. Biography Jovan Had≈æiƒá is remembered as a founder of the Matica Srpska and as the most persistent opponent of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's orthographic reform. However, Had≈æiƒá was also a poet and translator, a legislator in the Principality of Serbia, as well as an active public figure. Having established a commendable reputation through his early poetry, many thought he could be a worthy successor to Lukijan Mu≈°icki. As a student in Pest, Had≈æiƒá founded Matica Srpska in 1826, modeled in part after the recently established but dormant Magyar Tud√≥s T√°rsas√°g (Hungarian Scholarly Society) which eventually became the Hungarian Academy of Science. In addition to books, it published journal Serbski Letopis, founded two years earlier by Georgije Magara≈°eviƒá, Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik and Lukijan Mu≈°icki in Novi Sad, where Magara≈°eviƒá was professor and ≈†afarik the director of the Serbian gymnasium there. Vuk Karad≈æiƒá foresaw that the biggest battle in the future would be the battle for orthography. Had≈æiƒá wrote Sitnitze jezykoslovne (Language Details) in 1837, in which he attacked Vuk's reforms. He signed it with a pseudonym, Milo≈° Svetiƒá. Once a supporter of Vuk, Had≈æiƒá was now an opponent, like Metropolitan Stevan Stratimiroviƒá who died a year earlier (1836).

He had a great love of nature which is reflected in all his works. Biography Mileta Jak≈°iƒá was born on 29 March 1863 in Srpska Crnja in Banat. He was the nephew of one of the best-known Serbian poets of the 19th century, Djura Jak≈°iƒá (1832-1878). He was the son of Jovan and Emilija Jak≈°iƒá; his grandfather Dionisije and his father Jovan were parish priests of Srpska Crnja. At the age of seven Mileta's mother died. From his mother he inherited most of his characteristics, one of insatiable love of nature, an almost pedantic love of order and the most rigorous sense of duty. In 1879 Mileta went to Novi Sad, where he was enabled to attend gymnasium. After an interval of private study in Osijek he went in 1889 to the Theological College in Sremski Karlovci and in 1893 he went to Vienna, where he fell under the influence of Vatroslav Jagiƒá and Jakob Minor and others. On the completion of his university course in philology he returned home, was for three years rector of the Serbian Orthodox Seminary of Hopovo where he taught Serbian language, history and homiletics. From 1891 to 1899 he worked in Temisvar before returning to Srpska Crnja where he took over his father's parish until 1920. At the age of fifty he renounced the priesthood, and married Zorka Andrejeviƒá, a teacher from a nearby village of Klarija. They had a daughter, Emilija, who died in a car accident in 1949. During World War I he collected funds for the Red Cross societies of Serbia and Montenegro and when the Axis occupied Serbia Jak≈°iƒá was imprisoned for 15 days. After leaving Srpska Crnja and priesthood, he became chief librarian of Matica Srpska at Belgrade. Mileta Jak≈°iƒá died there on 8 November 1935, and was buried in Novo groblje. Poetry Mileta Jak≈°iƒá's first poems appeared in the literary review called Javor in 1891. In them we sense a strong influence of Vojislav Iliƒá with whom he shared a mutual friendship and literary sympathies with Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky. His own relationship to the Vojislavist movement, which is itself continuously recruiting new founding fathers (or grandfathers as in Vojislav Iliƒá's tracing of the movement to Pushkin) and claiming an almost meaninglessly wide circle of progeny. The most fundamental question raised by these poets is, to be sure, Nature itself. He followed ‚Äî Vojislavism ‚Äî of the time, though not the only one. Among the best known Serbian poets who looked up to Vojislav Iliƒá's genius, during that period were Milorad Mitroviƒá (poet), Aleksa ≈†antiƒá, Danica Markoviƒá, and for a short while even Jovan Duƒçiƒá who soon went on to abandon \\"Vojislavism\\" and start his own movement with Milan Rakiƒá. Mileta Jak≈°iƒá has written a large number of poems, some of which have appeared in volume form. He was the first to part company with Vojislavism and his Pesme (Poems), published in Velika Kikinda in 1899 (in volume form), demonstrates an original poet in the making. He started as a follower of Vojislav Iliƒá, but soon freed himself from all the \\"influences\\", to find his own original tone. He's a rare and sincere poet of his period: he writes what he sees around him and what he feels within himself. Mileta Jak≈°iƒá also wrote prose, his best work is \\"Mysteries\\". When poet Veljko Petroviƒá (poet) started writing stories Mileta Jak≈°iƒá withdrew, though his prose work was considered of high literary value. Both Veljko Petroviƒá and Mileta Jak≈ùiƒá are considered the best poets of old Vojvodina in their day. Any Serbian poet who is playing a high game ‚Äî as poet and worshipper ‚Äî in the presence of nature, must surely feel himself to be standing in the shadow of Vojislav Iliƒá and Pushkin, or in their light. According to critic Jovan Skerliƒá, Mileta Jak≈°iƒá was able to acknowledge the romantic poets and the nature poets. \\"For he follows a path that was plowed before him by Jovan Subotiƒá and Jovan Grƒçiƒá- Milenko.\\" Works * Pesme, Beograd 1922. * Deƒçija zbirka pesama i proze, Novi Sad 1929. * Sunƒçanica, Beograd 1929. * Legende i priƒçe za decu i odrasle, Beograd 1931. * Mirna vremena, Beograd 1935. * Deoba vrlika, Novi Sad * Sveti apostol Pavle, ≈æivot mu i rad, Novi Sad * Velika ti≈°ina * Neƒçista kuƒáa * Roman usamljenog mladiƒáa * Urok ;As editor * Deƒçija zbirka, J.

Biography Joksim Noviƒá was born in Zalu≈ænica, in Lika, on 15 March 1807. He completed his secondary education at the Serbian Gymnasium in Sremski Karlovci, studied philosophy at Jena, G√∂ttingen, The Hague, and law in S√°rospatak and in Vienna. Very little is known about him after graduation. We know he was in the royal guard of Mihailo Obrenoviƒá in the Principality of Serbia for a while. Then he went to Bosnia to fight the Ottoman occupiers and was captured. He was subsequently loaded with irons and sent a prisoner to a Turkish goal at Sarajevo. For the next two years, he was kept in close confinement. When he was released he was famous for defying the authorities. In 1847 he wrote a book of verse called Lazarica and had it published in Novi Sad. With Joksim Noviƒá, now nicknamed Otoƒçanin (the Incarcerated), a new voice seems to enter Serbian writing, or an old voice speaking virtually a new language. The advice was given to him years back by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá (to write as common folk speak) and Adam Mickiewicz (the exiled Polish poet who suggested that he take the Kosovo cycle and turn it into a national epic) now bore fruit. Before the 1848 Revolution, the Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy were being faced by grave challenges. Otoƒçanin played an important part in the revolutionary events of 1848/4, first as a member of a delegation to Vienna and later joining a group of Serbs formed to draft the constitution of Serbian Vojvodina. Prominent among them was the young lawyer Mojsije Georgijeviƒá of Osijek, and physician writer Jovan Stejiƒá. Joksim Noviƒá-Otoƒçanin was exposed to some of the dangers of the 1848 Revolution, and, it is said, escaped getting killed only by his presence of mind. In 1849 he moved to Serbia, and resided in Novi Sad till his death. There he wrote some of the most memorable romantic poems about Hajduk Veljko, Vasa ƒåarapiƒá, Janko Katiƒá, Stanoje Glava≈° (1860‚Äì61), Ilija Birƒçanin (1862), Du≈°anija: Znati Dogadjaji za Vremena Carstva (Du≈°an and the Matter of the Serbian Empire; 1863), Moskovija: Krimski Rat (Moscow: the Crimean War; 1863), Karaƒëorƒëe izbavitelj Srbije (Karageorge: Emancipator of Serbia, 1865).

It was designed by the Rooney Brothers and built by Cowell & Holt in 1888. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 January 1993.  History  St Mary's Church was erected in 1888, as a West Townsville mass centre and school for the Catholic parish of Townsville. It is the second oldest Catholic church in North Queensland. The former St Mary's Convent is a s residence acquired by the Catholic Church in 1917. Early settlement in Townsville began in the mid-1860s at the mouth of Ross Creek, and along the beach front to the north, but later development was concentrated along the creek to the west. By the late 1880s, West Townsville was a well settled area, and catholics in this area lived a considerable distance from St Joseph's Church and School on The Strand (established in the 1870s). Fr William Mason Walsh, second parish priest of Townsville, made the decision to establish a church and school in West Townsville, acquiring the St Mary's Church site in 1887. The West Townsville church was designed by Rooney Bros, who were the premier builders, and frequently also the designers, of vernacular architecture in Townsville and North Queensland during the latter part of the 19th century. Matthew and John Rooney and their families were strong supporters of the catholic church. thumb When St Mary's was erected by contractors Cowell & Holt in 1888, it was a simple rectangular structure with a nave and entrance porch. The present cedar pews in the nave date from this period. The sub-floor was enclosed to provide classroom space for the Sisters of Mercy, who opened St Mary's School there in the same year. The Sisters taught beneath the church until a new school building was erected on an adjacent block at the rear of the church in 1917. The Sisters of Mercy, an Irish teaching and nursing order of catholic nuns, had arrived in Townsville in 1878, in response to a request from Fr Walsh. For ten years the Mercy nuns taught solely at St Joseph's on The Strand. From 1888 some of the nuns travelled by sulky to teach in the classrooms established under St Mary's Church at West End, and only took up residence near St Mary's when the parish of St Mary's was established in 1917. St Mary's was Townsville's second catholic parish, and comprised the suburbs now known as Mundingburra, Hyde Park, Belgian Gardens and Garbutt. To accommodate the Sisters of Mercy within the new parish, the diocese purchased a timber residence in Castling Street, adjoining the church and school, early in 1917. The Castling Street residence is thought to have been constructed in the 1880s, but not on its present site. The original location is unknown, although it is likely to have come from one of the goldfields - probably Ravenswood or Charters Towers - to the west of Townsville. It was moved onto the site, possibly in 1897, when a mortgage for ¬£130 was taken out on the property by the owner, Gustave Anderson, who had purchased the site at a Crown land sale held on 23 December 1890. Anderson died at his Castling Street residence in January 1898, but his widow remained resident in Castling Street for some years. In May 1901, she married Lauritz Henriksen Hoyer, and a Lawrence Hoyar is listed in Castling Street in the 1904 Queensland Post Office Directory. Mrs Hoyer had sold the property to the Pritchard family by 1912, and they in turn sold to the Catholic Church. In 1917 the house, which was set on low stumps when acquired by the church, was raised on high wooden blocks, and the front southern room was extended into the front verandah to create a small chapel for the nuns. The front porch infill and rear extensions appear to date from this period also. Rooneys Ltd carried out the improvements, and St Mary's Convent was opened and blessed by Dr Joseph Shiel, Bishop of Rockhampton, on 12 August 1917. The sisters occupied this building until 1964, when it became the parish house for the priest. In 1975 the priest moved out and the house is now let. Major alterations to the church were carried out in 1923 by Doig & Ritchie, under the supervision of Ardel Rooney of Rooneys Ltd. The building was widened to include transepts on either side of the main altar, side aisles and a sacristy. The marble altar, wooden side altars, baptismal font, altar rails, pulpit, pine pews in the aisles, and wood and plaster Stations of the Cross, date from this period. Also in 1923, cottage style gardens were constructed around the church. Their cement edgings were used in 1988 to recreate gardens for the centenary year. Some large fig trees, planted in 1923, still shade the lawns along Castling Street. The palms, African tulips, crepe myrtles and callistemons and various other shrubs and trees were planted in the 1980s. The interiors of most catholic churches in Australia were modified as a result of changes in church thinking following Vatican II in 1963, but no alterations were made to St Mary's Church at West Townsville. The school closed on 16 July 1997.  Description  Rear view of St Mary's Church, 1994 = The Church = St Mary's Catholic Church is a Gothic Revival influenced, single-storeyed chamferboard building with a triple gable corrugated iron roof and is supported by square concrete posts. The building is located on a level corner site fronting Ingham Road to the north, which is divided by the North Coast railway line, and is surrounded by associated buildings including the Presbytery, School, Parish Hall and the former St Mary's Convent, which is currently a rented dwelling. The building has a T-shaped plan, with the nave facing north, a vestry to the west and confessionals to the east. The central, north entrance porch has twin timber stair and a gable roof. Gabled entrance porches are also located to the vestry and confessionals and the building has lancet hopper windows. Internally, the building has exposed timber scissor trusses with a diagonally boarded ceiling and ventilated centre ridge. Timber columns support the central gable and divide the nave into three volumes. An organ and choir gallery is located over the north entrance and is partially cantilevered. The building has pointed arch doors, with the entrance doors having timber battened ventilation panels above and the walls are lined with plywood. The building has an ornate grey marble altar and Calvary Arch, high quality plaster statues and carved timber pews, font and Stations of the Cross. Evidence of the original extent of the church can be seen underneath with a masonry supporting wall. A steel support structure has been installed under the altar. The grounds include mature fig trees to the Castling Street boundary. = The former Convent = The former Convent is a high-set single-storeyed timber building with a corrugated galvanised iron roof, situated at 15 Castling Street, West End, Townsville. In form, the building comprises a six-roomed core under a hipped roof, with a gabled entry porch to Castling Street and an encircling verandah of lesser pitch that meets the walls below the eaves line. Although the house is large and spacious, its proximity to the Church and Hall, its surrounding garden, its low pitched roof and its enclosure by horizontal timber louvres, all diminish its visual scale. The six central rooms are placed three to a side, each with a doorway to the central passage and french doors to the verandah. There is a kitchen, a bathroom and two sitting rooms in the rear enclosed verandah. At the front of the house, the southeast room has been extended into the verandah and rebuilt as a chapel, with a Gothic pointed arch opening inserted into the west wall. There are pointed arch ventilating openings to the internal doorways of the two front rooms, and ornamental crosses cut into the front porch panels. The core walls are of exposed frame construction with horizontal chamferboards with curved rebates, fixed to the inside face of vertical studs, with one bracing member in the centre of each wall. The house has pine floors throughout, nailed to joists on doubled bearers and supported on adzed round hardwood stumps; cover strips conceal the central cut along the passageway that is evidence of the house having been moved onto the site. Verandahs have raked ceilings lined in pine, and are enclosed with painted timber louvres. Interior walls and ceilings are lined with painted pine boards, with wall linings to the passage side. The area under the northern verandah has been built in to form a suite of rooms, with maps painted on the walls, illustrating their former function as school rooms.  Heritage listing  St Mary's Church & Convent was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 January 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Mary's Church, erected in 1888 with 1923 additions, is important in demonstrating an aspect of the pattern of Queensland history, namely, the establishment and growth of the Catholic Church in North Queensland. It also retains its s layout and fabric, and is significant as an early, intact residence of substantial proportions in Townsville. It demonstrates part of the pattern and evolution of Queensland history, surviving as important physical evidence of the widespread removal, transportation and re-erection of timber buildings in Queensland in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and more precisely, of the large numbers of buildings removed from Ravenswood and Charters Towers to Townsville in this period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Mary's Church remains substantially intact, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a simple, evolving timber church of the late 19th/early 20th centuries, in Townsville. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its scale, form and materials, St Mary's Church makes a significant contribution to the Ingham Road streetscape and Townsville townscape. The building is significant also for the quality and craftsmanship of the interior and fittings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. St Mary's Church is the second oldest catholic church in North Queensland, and is significant for its strong and special association as a centre of catholic worship, education and community life in Townsville for over a century. St Mary's Church is significant also for its special association with St Mary's parish, created in 1917, as only the second catholic parish in Townsville. St Mary's Church is significant for its special association with the Rooney family and their important North Queensland building firms of Rooney Bros, Rooney & Co. and Rooneys Ltd. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former St Mary's Convent is significant for its association with the contribution of the Sisters of Mercy to the educational and cultural life of West Townsville for nearly fifty years, and retains clear physical evidence of its function as a convent.

The building on Grundtvigsvej 14 is now part of University of Copenhagen's Frederiksberg Campus. History Interior The main entrance in the 1910s In the beginning of the 19th century the site belonged to a country house known as Christianshvile. In 1847, Christianshvile was sold to Christian P. Bianco Luno, who then sold off the land in lots prior to his death five years later. Two streets were named after him: Bianco Lunos All√© still exists today, whereas Bianco Lunos Sideall√© was renamed Grundtvigsvej in 1872. One of the lots on Bianco Lunos Sideall√© was sold to Martin Hansen-Gissemann in 1865. He initially built an apartment building on it. In 1873, he also opened Gimle, a two-storey building used as a sort of privately run community centre. The great hall could accommodate up to 1,400 guests and was used for a wide range of activities, including dancing, amateur theatre, political meetings and social events. The facilities also included a shooting range used by a lower- class clientele than that of the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society on Vesterbrogade. In 1876, the venue played host to the Danish Social Democratic Party's first congress. The party had been founded by Louis Pio, Harald Brix and Paul Geleff in 1871, but they had been imprisoned and were not released until 1875. The 75 representatives on the congress adopted the so-called \\"Gimle Programme\\". The building was also used as a venue by Borgerforeningen, but they later moved their social gatherings to Josty. The building was purchased by the Royal Danish Agricultural and Veterinary College in 1956. The building was modernized and converted into a canteen for students. Storm P murals In 1922, Storm P, together with his friend and colleague Christian Arhof, created a series of murals in the cellar under Gimle. They were restored by experts from the National Museum in 1997. One of the murals is an early representation of the character Peter Vimmelskaft who would later feature and the comic strip Peter and Ping.

He is the former Chief Content Officer for BitTorrent Inc., author of The Pirate‚Äôs Dilemma, and the founding editor-in-chief of RWD magazine.  Career =Early career= Mason grew up in London, and began DJing as a teen on the pirate radio stations Ice FM and Mac FM. He attended the University of Bristol where he graduated with a degree in Economics. After graduating, he worked in music and advertising industries at companies including Warner Music, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Mediacom. =RWD= In 2001, Mason became the founding editor-in-chief of RWD magazine. RWD was created to push new sounds emerging from the UK, most notably UK garage, grime and dubstep, and Mason became the first journalist to interview a number of prominent UK artists, including Dizzee Rascal, Skepta and Tinchy Stryder. RWD became the largest music magazine by circulation in the UK, growing from 5,000 copies a month to almost 100,000 copies a month. Based on his work at RWD, Mason was selected as one of the faces of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Start Talking Ideas campaign, and was presented the Prince's Trust London Business of the Year Award by Prince Charles in 2004.http://www.mattjmason.com/about Between 2001 and 2004, Mason also ran the independent label Tuned Plastic, specializing in UK garage, grime and dubstep. \\"Submarine\\", a record produced by Mason and released on Tuned Plastic, was included on DJ EZ's seminal Pure Garage: Bass Breaks and Beats compilation in 2001. Between 2003 and 2005, Mason also anonymously wrote the Grimewatch column for Vice magazine, only outing himself as its author in his last column before leaving RWD and moving to New York. =The Booo Krooo= Between 2002-2004, Mason teamed up RWD magazine's Online Director Alex Donne Johnson and illustrator Art Jaz to create the animated adult sitcom series The Booo Krooo. After the first 3-episode web series, the concept was co-signed by Missy Elliott who asked to be featured to promote her single \\"Work It\\". From here, Channel U commissioned a 6-episode series to launch their European music TV channel. This was later cited by Ransom Note as the first in the \\"grime comedy\\" genre. =The Pirate's Dilemma= In 2005, Mason moved to New York and began working on his first book, The Pirate‚Äôs Dilemma, released by Simon & Schuster in the US and Penguin in the UK in early 2008. The book was met with critical acclaim and became the first book to hit the number one spot on both Amazon's hip hop and economics bestseller lists at the same time. Wired gave the book 9 out of 10, and BusinessWeek named Mason 'Pirate of the Year'. In the book, Mason makes the case that the best way to beat piracy is to compete with it, by determining the value pirates are creating and creating legal alternatives. ‚ÄúBy short-circuiting conventional channels and red tape, pirates can deliver new materials, formats, and business models to audiences who want them,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúCanal Street moves faster than Wall Street. Piracy transforms the markets it operates in, changing the way distribution works and forcing companies to be more competitive and innovative. Pirates don't just defend the public domain from corporate control; they also force big business and government to deliver what we want, when we want it.‚Äù The paperback was released in 2009, and The Pirate‚Äôs Dilemma has since been published in ten countries. As a journalist, Mason's work began to appear outside of RWD and Vice. By 2009, he had been published in The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer Music Monthly, Dazed & Confused, Adweek, Complex, Lib√©ration, and other publications in more than 20 countries. = BitTorrent = Mason spent the next few years speaking on his work and consulting as well as working as Director of Innovation and Strategy for New York-based creative agency Syrup LLC. In 2011, he joined BitTorrent as head of marketing,http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/bittorrent- pirates-dilemma-matt-mason-interview taking on ‚Äúa full-time job reshaping BitTorrent‚Äôs tattered image,‚Äù as Fast Company would later describe it. When Mason started at BitTorrent, there was a plan on the table to rename the company. But according to Fast Company, ‚Äú(Mason) ran an experiment that gave everyone there pause. BitTorrent released a file-sharing product called SoShare and advertised it in two ways‚Äîas simply SoShare and as SoShare by BitTorrent. The ads with \\"BitTorrent\\" in them attracted five times more clicks. 'If you just put the word BitTorrent in front of something people already do on the web,' Mason says, 'people understand it means something different.' Changing the name was out.‚Äù Mason saw another opportunity at BitTorrent based on his previous work on piracy. BitTorrent had begun promoting specific artists‚Äô content in its download clients and he wanted to expand upon that. Mason transformed the experimental promotion of artists into a full-fledged product he called BitTorrent Bundles, which made it easy for artists to put packages of content into the BitTorrent ecosystem, which BitTorrent then promotes to its 170 million users. The company officially launched BitTorrent Bundle with the artist Kaskade in May 2013. The early results were encouraging. As Fast Company described it, \\"Best-selling self- help author Tim Ferriss‚Äîdesperate after being boycotted by bookstores for using Amazon as a publisher‚Äîreleased the first chapter of his book The 4-Hour Chef in a bundle, with recipes, an audiobook, and live workshop video content available in exchange for a user‚Äôs email address. About 210,000 people downloaded the bundle in the first week, and 85,000 of them followed a link to where Amazon sells the full book. Linkin Park used bundles to distribute a free trial of its recording software, StageLight, and soon after saw a 200% increase in the number of upgrades to the paid version. Madonna released a 17-minute film, which was downloaded 2.7 million times.\\" Under Mason‚Äôs leadership in marketing, BitTorrent reintroduced itself as a credible technology company with a 2013 billboard campaign that garnered a great deal of attention. The company anonymously posted billboards in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles depicting controversial statements such as \\"Your Data Should Belong to the NSA\\" and \\"The Internet Should Be Regulated\\". After several weeks of media confusion, including an investigation by the LA Times, Mason revealed in a blog post that BitTorrent was behind the ads. That same day, the statements were altered, displaying more positive messages such as \\"Your Data Should Belong to You\\" and \\"The Internet Should Be People Powered\\". \\"With the reveal, we are showing people that things don't actually have to be like that,\\" Mason told Mashable in an interview, referring to the original bleak messages. \\"If you look at BitTorrent's technology and protocols, things can be a different way.\\" A BitTorrent billboard in San Francisco, 2013 In May 2014, Mason was promoted to Chief Content Officer. On September 26, 2014, BitTorrent released their first pay-gated Bundle, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, an album by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke. Mason revealed that he had been working on the project with Yorke and Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich in secret for over a year. By February 2015, the album had been downloaded more than 4.5 million times. Today there are more than 30,000 artists using Bundle, and during 2014, more than 250 million fans legally downloaded a piece of content via the platform. = 1-800-N0TH1NG = In September 2015, Mason started at 1-800-N0TH1NG.

He left BitTorrent in June of that year and began working on his second book, a sci-fi novel about piracy in the near future, entitled Broadside. In 2013, Mason collaborated with Zegna brand designer Stefano Pilati on the tumblr based gN project to launch the designer‚Äôs first collection. In 2010, Mason made London Pirate Frequencies, a documentary with Vice on the past, present and future of pirate radio in London. In 2009, Mason collaborated with Nicholas Felton on Hard Times, an ‚Äòinfo-graphic novel‚Äô for Penguin which won best in show that year at SXSW.

From July 2015, the university stopped paying Rohith his monthly stipend of (excluding HRA), with friends alleging that he was targeted for raising issues on campus under the banner of Ambedkar Students' Association (ASA), an Ambedkarite student organization. The university official denied the allegation, blaming the delay on \\"paperwork\\". On 5 August, the university set up an inquiry against Rohith and four other ASA members, two days after they allegedly assaulted ABVP leader N. Susheel Kumar. On 17 August, BJP MP and Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya wrote to the HRD Minister urging action and claiming that the \\"Hyderabad University‚Ä¶ has in the recent past, become a den of casteist, extremist and anti-national politics\\". After a series of flip- flops, the five were suspended in September. On 17 December, the decision was upheld. After the confirmation of the suspension Vemula died of suicide on the 17th of January 2016. His death sparked protests and outrage across India and gained widespread media attention as a case of discrimination against Dalits in universities. Background and death Vemula was born on 30 January 1989 in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to Manikumar Vemula and Radhika. His father is from the Vaddera caste, classified as an Other Backward Class (OBC) in India's system of Reservations, and his mother, Radhika Vemula, is said to be from Mala community by birth, which is a Scheduled Caste, but was adopted by an Vaddera family. It is reported that Radhika was treated differently from the rest of her adoptive family because of her caste. A witness also said that she was abused by her. Rohith's own distress in seeing his mother abused and treated as inferior was made clear to his friends. His political activities, based on his and his mother's experiences, suggested that he identified as a Dalit, and was advocating for Dalit rights. A District Level Scrutiny Committee that looked into the caste status of the family declared that neither Rohith nor his mother were Dalits but belonged to the OBC category. A PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad, in July 2015 the University reportedly stopped paying Vemula the fellowship of per month after he was \\"raising issues under the banner of Ambedkar Students Association (ASA)\\", though a university official denied the allegation of non-payment of scholarship, citing the delay on \\"paperwork.\\" At the beginning of August 2015, Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) claims that they organised a seminar or public meeting to discuss the death penalty for Yakub Memon, a convict in 1993 Bombay bombings in which 257 people were killed. But ABVP claims \\"Vemula and four ASA members held a funeral prayer\\". ASA also condemned the ABVP protest on the screening of the documentary Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai in Delhi University. On 3 August 2015, he and other ASA activists demonstrated at the Hyderabad campus. In response, ABVP's university unit president, Nandanam Susheel Kumar, called them \\"goons\\" on Facebook. The next day, Kumar was taken to hospital and operated for an acute appendicitis, but stated that he was \\"roughed up by around 40 ASA members who barged into [his] room.\\" According to The Indian Express, an anonymous ASA member stated that \\"When we confronted Susheel in his hostel room, he tendered a written apology in the presence of the university‚Äôs security officer. But the next day he got himself admitted in a hospital and alleged that members of ASA had manhandled him. The university ordered an inquiry while ABVP lodged a police complaint.\\" According to the publication, \\"the ABVP wrote to BJP MP from Secunderabad and Union Minister Dattatreya, alleging that the ASA members were indulging in 'casteist' and 'anti-national' activities. Dattatreya stated that he \\"forwarded the letter on my official letterhead to Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani. I do not know what happened after that. ABVP or BJP has nothing to do with that.\\" The letter was then forwarded to the University's Vice- Chancellor professor P. Appa Rao. In response, further action was taken against Vemula by the college on 5 August 2015, expelling him from his hostel along with the other four members of the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), while \\"ABVP‚Äôs Kumar was let off with a warning.\\" In September, the five students were suspended, a decision which was upheld on 17 December 2015. Meanwhile, his family struggled to help him, and Vemula had to borrow money from a friend. On 3 January 2016, after the suspension was confirmed, \\"the five moved out of their hostel rooms to a tent they set up inside the campus and began a \\"relay hunger protest.\\" On 17 January 2016, Vemula committed suicide, hanging himself with an ASA banner. In his suicide note, he blamed the \\"system\\" for his death. According to the suicide note, he committed suicide in the room of one Umma Anna, in whose room he was staying after being expelled from the hostel by the authorities at the University of Hyderabad. The note also said: Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha that no doctor was allowed to help Vemula and that \\"Instead, his body was used as a political tool. No police was allowed till 6:30AM the following morning.\\" However, the Chief Medical Officer of the university, M. Rajashree, denied that was the case. His father, Manikumar, has alleged that his son's death was not suicide and demanded a judicial inquiry. Dattatreya was accused of being responsible for the suicide. According to Dattatreya's critics, his letter to the Education Minister, complaining about degraded student politics, had led to Vemula's suspension and ultimate suicide. Vemula's suicide letter did not blame anyone, and Dattatreya denied these allegations. After a complaint from students of the University of Hyderabad a police case was filed under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against Bandaru Dattatreya, Bharatiya Janata Party's MP from Secunderabad and Indian government's Minister of Labour and Employment; Ramachandra Rao (BJP MLC); and Appa Rao Podile (University of Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor). Caste status controversy Rohith had a Scheduled Caste certificate for Hyderabad University admission. After External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj claimed that Rohith Vemula was not a Dalit, a police investigation was started to determine his caste status. The case against Dattatreya, Rao and Podile was likely to collapse if Vemula was not a Dalit. His brother's caste certificate lists him as Vaddera, and Vemula's uncle gave a statement to the police that Rohith's father was from that caste, which is classified as a Backward and non-scheduled caste in Andhra Pradesh. The District Level Scrutiny Committee in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, which was reviewing the Dalit status of Rohith Vemula, submitted its final report to the government stating that neither Rohith nor his mother Radhika were Dalits. However, according to a documentary film made by Srikanth Chintala,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beSyOEhh94A Radhika Vemula's foster mother clearly stated that Radhika Vemula was adopted by her and she belonged to a Dalit community. A video of Rohith Vemula's father Mani Kumar also stated in the documentary film that Radhika Vemula belonged to a Scheduled Caste. The existing law states in Rajendra Shrivastava vs State of Maharashtra (2010), the question for determination was: ‚ÄúIf a woman who by birth belongs to a scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe marries to a man belonging to a forward caste, whether on marriage she ceases to belong to the scheduled caste or the scheduled tribe?‚Äù The full bench of the Bombay high court relied on the constitution bench decision of the Supreme Court in the case of V.V. Giri vs D. Suri Dora (1959), where it was held that caste is acquired by birth and does not undergo a change by marriage or adoption.https://thewire.in/law/legal-precedent-establishes-radhika-vemula- and-her-children-are-dalits On 14 April 2016, on Ambedkar Jayanti, Rohit Vemula's mother Radhika Vemula and brother Raja Vemula converted to Buddhism in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Reactions His suicide sparked protests and outrage from across India and gained widespread media attention as an alleged case of discrimination against Dalits and low status castes in India, in which elite educational institutions have been purportedly seen as hotbeds of caste-based discrimination against students belonging to lower caste. In his suicide note, 26-year-old Rohith had shared that he always wanted to be a science writer like Carl Sagan. Ann Druyan, Sagan's third wife, depressed by discrimination against Dalit students, said that she mourned Rohith's death and lost promise, and responded to Rohith's words in a letter: Rohith's suicide was described as \\"institutional murder\\" by Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati, The poet Ashok Vajpeyi returned his D.Litt. degree awarded to him by the University of Hyderabad in protest against the circumstances which led to the death of Vemula, for which Vajpeyi holds the university culpable. An open letter was written to the vice-chancellor of the University of Hyderabad by over 120 worldwide academics, protested the role of the university in the events.

Over the 17 years when he had horses in training, Miller won 161 races, worth ¬£114,005. Life Miller was the eldest surviving son of Sir William Miller, 1st Baronet, by Mary Anne, daughter of John Farley Leith, a Queen's Counsel and Member of Parliament for Aberdeen. He was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst. Miller was a Captain in the 14th Hussars from 1885 to 1892, and Adjutant from 1888 to 1892; and served in the Second Boer War from 1900 where in 1901 he was second in command of the sixth battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. He was made an Hon. Major in the army in 1901 and became a full Major in the Lothians and Berwickshire Imperial Yeomanry from March 1902. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Manderston House Stables Miller was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Berwickshire. His father's fortune, made from herring, allowed Miller to commission the complete rebuild of Manderston House as a stately home, near Duns, Berwickshire. His town residence was 45 Grosvenor Square, Belgravia, London. On 22 January 1906, Miller died at Manderston. His remains were interred at Christ Church, Duns. On the turf In 1889 Miller, who had previously owned steeplechasers, became an owner of Thoroughbred racehorses. In May 1890, he bought a racehorse called Sainfoin. Less than a month later, the horse won The Derby. The purchase was from Sir Robert Jardine and John Porter; Sainfoin had won the Esher Stakes at Sandown Park easily. The price was ¬£6000, plus half the value of the Derby, if the horse won. Sainfoin came in first, ahead of Le Noir, Orwell, and Surefoot. Sainfoin, Derby winner 1890 Miller's next stroke was the purchase in 1894 for 4100 guineas, as a yearling, of the mare Roquebrune (foaled in 1893), by St. Simon, who had been bred by the Duchess of Montrose. With Roquebrune he won the New Stakes at Ascot and the Zetland Stakes at Doncaster. Mated in 1899 with Sainfoin, Roquebrune produced Rock Sand, her first foal. With this colt Miller won in 1902 the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom, the Coventry Stakes at Ascot, the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, and the Dewhurst Plate at Newmarket. In the following year Rock Sand won the Two Thousand Guineas, Derby, and St. Leger. During the three seasons he was in training, the horse won stakes to the value of ¬£45,618, and helped place Miller at the head of the list of winning owners in 1903 and 1904, with totals of ¬£24,768 and ¬£27,928 respectively. Rock Sand, Derby winner 1903 In 1895 Miller won the Oaks with La Sagesse, a daughter of Wisdom, and in 1901 his filly Aida, by Galopin, won the One Thousand Guineas. His major success in handicaps was the victory in the Cesarewitch of 1898 with Chaleureux, the sire of the filly Signorinetta, who in 1908 won the Derby and Oaks for Edoardo Ginistrelli. Miller established a breeding farm at Hamilton Stud, Newmarket, where Rock Sand was foaled. He was elected a member of the Jockey Club in 1903, and became a steward of the Club. In December 1905 he sold by auction most of his mares, and Roquebrune was purchased by a Belgian breeder for 4500 guineas. Rock Sand was sold, after Miller's death, to August Belmont, Jr., for ¬£26,000. Family Miller married, 19 January 1893, Eveline (1864‚Äì1934) daughter of Alfred Nathaniel Holden Curzon, 4th Baron Scarsdale (1831‚Äì1916) by his spouse Blanche (1837‚Äì1875), daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse, of Netherhall. They had no issue, and he was succeeded by his brother John Alexander Miller.

He was assigned to the 1st Company of the Regiment of Senegalese soldiers of Chad and in February 1942 was promoted to Adjutant. While training in Morocco, his regiment was evacuated to England. From there he took part in the D-Day landings and went on to fight German tank and infantry divisions in the For√™t d'√âcouves. Badly wounded in a battle on the outskirts of Paris, he was discharged and sent to a hospital from which he escaped and hitch-hiked to Paris to rejoin his unit. He then fought with them in a series of battles at Andelot, Hourcourt, and Ch√¢tel-sur-Moselle. For his role in establishing the bridgehead across the Moselle, he was promoted to Sub-lieutenant in September 1944. In November, he was again wounded (so seriously this time that he was given the Last Rites), but recovered and rejoined his unit to fight in the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign and eventually in Germany at Berchtesgaden. After the war ended, Teisseire was promoted to Lieutenant and assigned to French Indochina, arriving in Saigon in December 1946.

It was designed by Robert Hoggan and built in 1891. It is also known as Townsville Observatory. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  In 1891 an astronomical observatory and trigonometrical (trig) station were constructed at the top of Stanton Hill in Townsville, to the design of government surveyor and astronomer Robert Hoggan. The observatory no longer survives, but the concrete trig station remains. In the late 19th century, trig stations were erected in most of the principal towns of Queensland, as part of the first attempt to map Queensland on a large scale using common data. Despite the passage of years this data remains important because of its comparative value for modern surveyors. Most of the Queensland trig stations were timber posts, only remnants of which survive, erected to support a theodolite which measured vertical and horizontal lines. At Townsville and Thursday Island, concrete pillars rather than timber posts were erected, and these have survived largely because of their more substantial construction. Although surveyors no longer need to use the Townsville trig station, it is still in a serviceable condition.  Description  The Townsville Astronomical Trigonometrical Station is situated on the northern boundary of a home units complex which occupies the summit of Stanton Hill. It is constructed of concrete and is cone shaped. The pillar stands high by in diameter with three holes in the top, which supported the theodolite. A paved area and gardens surround the trig station.  Heritage listing  Townsville Astronomical Trigonometrical Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Townsville Astronomical Trigonometrical Station, erected in 1891, is significant for its historical role in land surveying in Queensland, and typologically, as one of only two concrete astronomical trig stations constructed in Queensland in the 19th century.

Hubert Bourgin is clearly a socialist and syndicalist doctrinal position: socialism Lucien Herr and Jean Jaures. He is a member of the Socialist Party. Mobilized August 6, 1914, he began the war as an instructor at Prytan√©e La Fl√®che, second lieutenant of infantry (Department forges); he became Head of Information to the Undersecretariat of State Artillery and ammunition.

He remained during this correction period to contest the Polytechnic and repeater at Conservatoire National des arts et M√©tiers. He was a member of the editorial staff of the right-wing newspaper Le Nouveau si√®cle founded on 26 February 1925, along with Georges Valois, Jacques Arthuys and Philippe Barr√®s. He joined Valois's Faisceau, the first party with fascist allegiance in France. The new party was violently opposed to the Action Fran√ßaise of Charles Maurras. He then wrote a series of highly controversial books (Fifty years of democratic experience, 1925; The Normal School and politics, 1938; The National School, 1942; The academic socialism, 1942). The general idea of his works is that with proletarian education at all levels, the bourgeois state is playing a dangerous game and is the architect of its own downfall. During World War II, he evolved into a main right position approximated French Action and ideas, without adhering to it, and defended anti-Germanic and nationalist positions. There is also general secretary of the newspaper Civic Progress, \\"social development diary\\". He has written many books on socialism, trade unionism, the Pan-German, German militarism, and biographical books about Fourier and Proudhon. On a personal level, he adopted Georges and Marcel Viennot Viennot which then took the name of Georges-Viennot Bourgin and Marcel Viennot-Bourgin.

The first espresso coffee was drunk in space by astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti on 3 May 2015. ISSpresso is one of nine experiments selected by the Italian Space Agency for the Futura mission.  History  In 2014, Argotec and Lavazza partnered to determine the feasibility of the project. Argotec then approached ASI, with Lavazza as a partner, and ASI agreed to sponsor the ISSpresso as an ASI payload on the ISS. NASA approval was then obtained. During the same year a feasibility study with the creation of some subsystems was conducted in order to validate the technological choices. On 14 April 2015, the flight model of ISSpresso was sent with SpaceX CRS-6 to the International Space Station and on 3 May 2015, Samantha Cristoforetti drank the first espresso in micro-gravity conditions. On 30 September 2017, Paolo Nespoli used the espresso machine on board the ISS to celebrate International Coffee Day. The ISSpresso's \\"Coffee in Space\\" mission came to an end on 14 December 2017.  Objectives  Use of the machine was done in conjunction with a zero-g espresso cup that uses capillary action to wick fluid into the mouth. This is an Earth-bound image taken in 2015 (gravity is acting on the fluid) Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti drinking espresso out of the cup on ISS, 2015 ISSpresso is designed to prepare espresso. Prior to this experiment only soluble coffee was available in space. The astronauts can select the drink of interest between the following options: short black (30 ml), long black (60 ml), and hot drink (tea or broth, 120 ml). It also has a flush cycle (60 ml) to clean the hydraulic circuit at the end of supply. The possibility of delivering broth allows for the rehydration of space food. ISSpresso also offers the opportunity to study some physical phenomena related to the fluid dynamics in microgravity of (pure and mixed) liquids at high pressure and temperature. The analysis of the foam formation with respect to that of the terrestrial coffee was of particular interest, starting from the design of the system in order to obtain it in microgravity. There are a number of aspects to espresso brewing and consumption that are related to or affected by gravity. One of the challenges was trying to produce the beverage in micro-gravity environment.  Differences in respect to a commercial espresso maker  The first noticeable difference concerns the size and weight: and nearly . ISSpresso is heavier and more complex primarily because of the materials choice and the introduced redundancies to meet the safety requirements in all phases of the mission. The ducts of the hydraulic circuit are made from steel, not plastic, to support operational loads up to . The brewer has been designed to minimize the amount of water remaining after the infusion. Furthermore, it hosts a set of microswitches that prevent the leakage of hot water under high pressure in case of unsuccessful or improper closure of the brewer itself. The system to remove the used capsule in microgravity works via means of an aluminum piston that is activated by the astronaut, who drives the capsule into a disposal pouch. This is installed in the proximity of the brewer. The liquid taken from the water container is almost entirely used during the preparation. The resulting mixture is collected in a drink pouch. Contrary to the terrestrial machines, it is not necessary to have a collection tank considering that there is very limited waste water.  Operation  Cristoforetti next to ISSpresso machine, which can also produce other beverages including tea The machine has conditions of use that are similar to the traditional ones, in order to facilitate the operations of the astronauts without requiring specific training. After verifying that the water container is installed properly, the astronaut inserts the coffee capsule into an opening on the top surface of the machine, then they close the small door and select the drink size. After that, they attach the drink pouch to the adapter and start the process of making coffee. The interfaces of the water container as well as of the drink pouch are the same used with the potable water dispenser installed on the space station, in order to facilitate the use of the system by the astronaut.  Design and qualification  Through the safety process, NASA verified that the hardware would meet the necessary requirements and it has certified the system for the flight on the ISS. The external and internal structure of the machine was designed and tested to support the loads transmitted by the launch of the SpaceX CRS-6 spacecraft.  Prototypes and models  ISSpresso has been designed, built and tested by Argotec in four main models over 18 months. *The first model, called 2-D, represents a prototype of the hydraulic and pneumatic systems. A pump and a commercial brewer were used. *The second model, known as the Elegance Model, was developed to test the mechanical functions of the machine: many of the mechanical components correspond with those used for the flight unit. *The third model, the so-called Ground Model, is the \\"Earth model\\". It is almost functionally identical to the flight model. A campaign of extensive testing to obtain the launch qualification was carried out on this model. *The Protoflight model, i.e. flight model, is the final version that incorporates all the best technical solutions implemented in the previous models. The flight model has been subjected to the processes of qualification and has been certified by NASA for use aboard the International Space Station.

History  In 1929 Siberian Institute of National Economy was launched in Novosibirsk, and was based in the contemporary building of Novosibirsk State architectural and art Academy. The main aim was to provide the economic managers for the national economics. Teaching staff in 1929 consisted of 10 people and in 1931 it gained up to 57, within them: 4 professors, 19 associate professors. In the first academic year Institute launched 4 faculties: planned economy, industrial, product exchange and distribution, economic and agricultural management. In 1967 according to Administrative order by the Minister of high and secondary education ) Novosibirsk Institute of National Economy (NINE) was launched on the basis of All Union correspondence financial-and-economic Institute branch. NINE was launched on the 1 of August 1968. The first rector was Victor Pervushin. In 1986 Peter Shemetov became rector. He was aimed on pre-entry preparation and bringing up a multi-level educational system in Institute. He launched Doctorate degree education and printing and publications center. An important place was given to the pre-higher education faculty, which was later transformed into Economic lyceum ‚Äì the first behind the Urals. In those years there was shortage of qualified specialists in the fields of economics (financiers, accountants, etc.), and the Institute met this demand. In 1994 the Institute received the status of the Academy, and in 2004, the status of the University. The University status led NSUEM to a new name: Novosibirsk State University of Economics and Management. Most structures of modern NSUEM were created in post-soviet time. NSUEM graduates There are: * Faculty of Information and Technologies (reformed), * Faculty of Law, * Faculty of Social and Humanitarian Science (reformed), * Center of training and certification for auditors under the Ministry of Finance of Russian Federation, * Training center for crisis managers, * Center of information technologies, which is responsible for implementing information technologies at the whole university, * Case-club of NSUEM, where student can develop their skills to find the best options and decisions in complicated working situations, * International business school, where some international educational programs are realized, * International center of computer education \\"APTECH NSUEM\\" (the official center of corporation APTECH WORLDWIDE), * Children computer school of animation, where teenagers and children can learn how to use modern technologies, * Center of graduates support, etc. In 1991 Thesis board was organized. In 1992 Institute has become an experimental place to launch double level education system: Bachelor's Degree and master's degree. In January, 2001 for the first time issued its magazine ‚ÄúOur Academy‚Äù In September 2012 the 5th academic block was delivered, and before that NSUEM launched the 4th academic block. Since 7 June 2014 NSUEM is headed by Alexandr Novikov. University was reorganized: * Institutes were formed into faculties; * New management system was formed (Departments of youth policy, external affairs, informational technologies and scientific policy)  NSUEM rectors  * Viktor Aleksanrovich Pervushin (19 May 1967 ‚Äì 17 May 1974) * Viktor Nikolaevich Schukin (17 May 1974 ‚Äì 19 July 1983) * Anatolii Danilovich Korobkin (14 July 1983 ‚Äì 15 September 1986) * Petr Vasiljevich Shemetov (27 November 1986 ‚Äì 16 February 1998) * Yurii Vasiljevich Gusev (28 April 1998 ‚Äì 29 April 2013) * Olga Vitaljevna Molchanova (29 April 2013 ‚Äì 22 May 2014) * Alexandr Vladimirovich Novikov (7 July 2014 ‚Äì to the present day)  NSUEM today  Novosibirsk State University of Economics and Management (NSUEM) is the biggest educational complex in the field of economics in Western Siberia.

Arteche develops equipment and solutions for the electric power industry, including generation, transmission and distribution. The company employs almost 2,400 people on 4 continents (2014). Arteche equipment is installed in more than 150 countries. Arteche divides its operations into three business units: instrument transformers, power grid and turnkey solutions.  History = First years = Mr. Aurelio Arteche, December 1946. After nine years in exile due to the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, Aurelio de Arteche y Arana (1908‚Äì1983) returned to Bilbao, his hometown, in 1946 to accomplish his main life objective: creating a company like Usines Balteau, S.A., a company he knew during his exile in Belgium. Thanks to help from friends, family and Marcel Balteau, Aurelio founded EAHSA, Electrotecnica Arteche Hermanos, S.A., in December 1946. EAHSA manufactured Balteau's Instrument Transformers for the Spanish and Portuguese markets. = 1954 to 1974 = 1954-74 was a period of stronger growth for Arteche. Manufacturing Balteau's Instrument Transformers and ICE-Paris's Auxiliary Relays. The company grew over 22,8% per year. During these years, Arteche expanded in the national market, becoming a benchmark for the Spanish power industry. Aurelio decided that producing under license presented major disadvantages, primarily inability to develop its own technology, and inability to export to other markets. = 1974 to 1995 = In 1973, Arteche ended its relationship with Usines Balteau, S.A. and with ICE- Paris. The company sought the ability to export beyond the Iberian Peninsula, objected the grant of a license to a rival Portuguese company, and Usines Balteau's refusal to create a common technology center. The separation from ICE-Paris was triggered by frequent supply problems. However, the main reason was Arteche's desire to internationalize and develop its own products, technologies and solutions. During this period growth shrank to 1,5% per year. A substantial portion of the company resources were devoted to the development of new products and solutions and to open new markets. Arteche completed several milestones during this period, such as the production of its own Auxiliary Relays (1976), Instrument Transformers up to 765 kV (1981) and Electronic Instrument Transformers (1990). During these years, Arteche had its first sales in South America (1976) and North America (1993). = 1995- = Arteche entered Asia (2004) and Oceania (2010), while adding products include Voltage Transformers for GIS substations and Optical Current Transformers (2010). Arteche added solutions for Automation and Distribution equipment (2003), Power Quality solutions (2005), solutions for substation construction (2005) and Turnkey Projects for wind farms. In 2012 Arteche changes its visual identity, adapting its logotype. The new logo is based upon a fractal, a succession of almost parallel lines, a structure that repeats itself at different levels, with Arteche's colours in gradients.

Various legal actions followed, including eight women who took action against the Metropolitan Police and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), stating they were deceived into long-term intimate relationships by five officers, including Mark Kennedy, the first officer to be identified as such, who was publicly identified on 21 October 2010 as infiltrating social and environmental justice campaigns, and Mark Kennedy himself who claimed in turn that he had been incompetently handled by his superiors and denied psychological counselling. According to The Guardian, Kennedy sued the police for ruining his life and failing to \\"protect\\" him from falling in love with one of the environmental activists whose movement he infiltrated. Although the units had been previously disbanded, other cases continued to emerge. In 2015 a public inquiry under a senior judge was announced. In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police published an unreserved apology in which it exonerated and apologised to those women who had been deceived and stated the methodology had constituted abuse and a \\"gross violation\\" with severely harmful effects, as part of a settlement of their cases. In 2016 new cases continued to come to light. Background  Mark Kennedy (also known as Mark Stone and Flash) is a former London Metropolitan Police officer who, whilst attached to the police service's National Public Order Intelligence Unit, (NPOIU) infiltrated many protest groups between 2003 and 2010 before he was unmasked by political activists as an undercover policeman on 21 October 2010. In January 2011, it was reported that Kennedy worked for several years as an undercover infiltrator for the National Public Order Intelligence Unit with seven years work in the environmental protest movement. During this time he had entered into intimate relationships on false grounds, which came to light during 2010 as being part of a systemic pattern of exploitation and manipulation of women in such movements. It also emerged that some of these undercover police relationships had resulted in children whose fathers later \\"vanished\\" when their role was completed.  Other related undercover controversies  It later emerged that Kennedy had previously undertaken criminal acts as part of his role for other countries, including Denmark where he stated that, in the guise of an environmental activist, he was used by the police forces of 22 countries and was responsible for the closing down of the Youth House community centre in Copenhagen, and in Germany, for German police, including arson. German MP Andrej Hunko raised questions in the German Bundestag concerning what the German authorities knew about Kennedy's activities amongst the Berlin protest movement. Kennedy had been arrested in Berlin for attempted arson, but was never brought to trial. Hunko also asked: \\"How does the federal government justify the fact that [Mark Kennedy], as part of his operation in Germany, did not only initiate long-term meaningful friendships but also sexual relationships, clearly under false pretenses?\\" The German government refused to answer all questions relating to Kennedy. The use of undercover officers also caused the collapse of trials and led to the revelation of unlawful withholding of evidence by the Crown Prosecution Service. Six activists accused of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass at Ratcliffe-on- Soar Power Station collapsed following the revelation of undercover police involvement, in which the police were described as having been not just observers, but agent provocateurs: \\"We're not talking about someone sitting at the back of the meeting taking notes - he was in the thick of it.\\" Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) barrister Felicity Gerry was forced to withdraw the case against the activists after Kennedy confessed to the set-up, evidence of which the CPS had withheld from the defence. The CPS also withheld the fact that Kennedy was giving testimony under the false name Mark Stone using a false passport supplied by the police. Secret tapes \\"that could have exonerated six activists, known as the \\"deniers\\" because they claimed not to have agreed to join the protest\\" and \\"evidence gathered by the Guardian now suggests it was the Crown Prosecution Service rather than the police that withheld the tapes.\\" CPS lawyer Ian Cunningham faced dismissal after a report by Sir Christopher Rose criticised Cunningham for failing to ask questions about Kennedy‚Äôs involvement in the Ratcliffe plot.  Impact, Inquiry and aftermath of disclosures  As of 2016 the legal cases continue. In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police force apologised to seven women \\"tricked into relationships\\" over a period of 25 years by officers in the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU). The officers involved had eventually \\"vanished\\", leaving questions and deceit behind, described by victims as \\"psychological torture\\". Financial settlements estimated at ¬£3 million for the seven claimants were also made as part of the settlement. The disclosures also led to the closing of the units concerned, and a public inquiry, the Undercover Policing Inquiry, concerning the conduct of police in undercover operations. The inquiry is headed by senior judge Lord Justice Pitchford, a Lord Justice of Appeal and member of the Privy Council. One group representing victims of such practices is the Undercover Research Group, whose website provides alternate coverage and comments on the inquiry. As of April 2018 the inquiry has confirmed that undercover police had infiltrated the following groups and movements: :Anarchist groups, Animal Liberation Front, Anti-Apartheid Movement, Anti- Fascist Action, Big Flame, Black Power movement, Brixton Hunt Saboteurs, Colin Roach Centre, Dambusters Mobilising Committee, Dissent!, Earth First!, Essex Hunt Saboteurs, Friends of Freedom Press Ltd, Globalise Resistance, Independent Labour Party, Independent Working Class Association, International Marxist Group, International Socialists, Irish National Liberation Solidarity Front, London Animal Action, London Animal Rights Coalition, London Boots Action Group, London Greenpeace, Militant, No Platform, Antifa, Operation Omega, Reclaim the Streets, Red Action, Republican Forum, Revolutionary Socialist Students Federation, Socialist Party, Socialist Workers Party, South London Animal Movement (SLAM), Tri-Continental, Troops Out Movement, Vietnam Solidarity Campaign, West London Hunt Saboteurs, Workers Revolutionary Party, Young Haganah, Young Liberals, Youth against Racism in Europe. Former policeman Andy Coles was elected in 2015 as a Conservative councillor on Peterborough City Council and appointed a deputy to the Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner in 2016. After a mention in his younger brother Richard Coles' autobiography, he was accused of having deceived a 19-year-old political activist into a sexual relationship while he was a 32-year-old undercover police officer in the 1990s. In February 1995 the then Detective Sergeant Coles wrote the \\"Tradecraft manual for undercover police\\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20180319-TC- Documents_Final_Version.pdf. He resigned as deputy commissioner on 15 May 2017 but remains a councillor and school governor. Eventually at least 12 women received compensation from the police in the High Court of Justice, though the police avoided making internal documents about the relationships public. =Investigatory Powers Tribunal trial= Kate Wilson, one of the women who had sued the police in the high court over the relationship with undercover officer Mark Kennedy, started a case in 2018 at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, alleging the police had infringed her human rights in five ways. In court documents, the police admitted that Kennedy‚Äôs line manager and other officers were aware of the sexual relationship, stating \\"sexual relationship with [Wilson] was carried out with the acquiescence of his cover officers and line manager\\". Previously the police had suggested such relationships were not officially sanctioned. Scope for criminal charges Rape in English law is defined as \\"unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who (a) at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and (b) at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she consents to it.\\" The basis of a prosecution therefore revolves around whether or not consent is given in law, or its absence was ignored. The CPS statement clarified that misrepresenting identity, and obtaining sexual consent due to a false identity, was not generally a crime in UK law, other than in specific situations such as impersonating a person's partner, or deceit as to gender. Other than in specific limited situations set out in statute, the general rule in UK law is that deceit only creates a case of rape (known as \\"rape by deception\\" or \\"rape by fraud\\") if \\"the act consented to was not the act undertaken\\". Crown Prosecutors declined to bring charges against any police officers or their supervisors, including charges for rape and other sexual crimes (covering sex under false pretences, unconsented sexual acts, and other potential offences), on the basis that rape charges would be unlikely to succeed. For similar reasons, indecent assault, procurement for sexual intercourse by false pretences, and misconduct in office were also felt to lack sufficient basis for a conviction. A leading case on \\"rape by fraud\\" is R v Linekar,R v Linekar [1995] 3 All ER 69 73 in which the Court of Appeal had previously held that very narrow restrictions should apply to such cases of deceit in the context of rape prosecutions. (The reasoning being that otherwise rape could be alleged following any minor broken promise or any misrepresentation with sexual activity, and would risk no longer being a uniformly serious offence.) http://www.rjerrard.co.uk/law/cases/linekar.htm - legal analysis of when deceit can cause a case to be chargeable as rape, in English law Police response In November 2015, the Metropolitan Police Service issue the following statement:  Victims' ongoing concerns In January 2016, further cases continued to come to light. A complainant stated that they sought disclosure of the cover names of officers who were engaged undercover in this way, and their supervising officers, so that those who had been deceived into relationships, and potentially suffered thereby, would be able to discover the fact.  Changes to UK undercover policing practices  At present, the inquiry is in process and the final report not yet created; the sole known impact on police practice is the above statement combined with the alleged disbanding of the units involved.

Born in north London into a family with strong left-wing links, she was personal secretary to Count Mihaly Karolyi, exiled socialist president of Hungary, and later became secretary to the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London. Galton joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, travelled several times to Russia, and Kim Philby, who was actually working for the KGB, took an interest in her. She was under some form of surveillance for much of her working life but no conclusive evidence of espionage was ever found against her. In retirement she became an expert in beekeeping and wrote several books on the subject. Early life Modern view of Galton's childhood home (centre) in Wood Green, London Dorothy Galton was born on 14 October 1901 at 66 Rathcoole Avenue, Hornsey, London, to Frank Wallace (or Wallis) Galton and his wife, Jessie Jane Townsend Galton, n√©e Cottridge. Her father was secretary to Sidney and Beatrice Webb and later, the Fabian Society.\\"Mr. F.W. Galton\\", The Times, 12 April 1952, p. 8. She had an older sister Beatrice Jessie Galton. At the time of the 1911 census, the family were living at 49 Bounds Green Road, Wood Green, London.1911 England, Wales & Scotland Census Transcription. Retrieved 22 February 2016. She was educated at home and then at a secondary school in Wood Green. She attended Bedford College, the University of London's college for women, but soon left and did not earn a degree. She studied Slavonic languages privately. As a young woman she underwent an operation that prevented her from having children.Karl Showler, \\"Galton, Dorothy Constance (1901‚Äì1992)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Online edition. Retrieved 19 January 2016. Early career Galton's early working life was as an assistant in the research and information department of the Labour Party from 1920‚Äì25 and then in 1925-26 as private secretary to Count Mihaly Karolyi, the exiled socialist president of Hungary, during which time she travelled with him and his wife to France. It was around this time that Galton first came to official notice after her work for Karolyi was noted in a report to Scotland Yard from Paris.National Archives, KV 2/3049. It seems that after she stopped working for Karolyi she was occupied translating from French to English, √âmile Faguet's Politiques et moralistes du XIXe si√®cle which was published by Ernest Benn in 1928 as Politicians & moralists of the nineteenth century in their Library of European Political Thought. Bernard Pares, later first director of SSEES, in Russia during the First World War In 1928, Galton became secretary to professor Bernard Pares at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), at that time part of King's College London. When the school became an independent body in 1932, Galton became its administrative secretary.Roberts, I.W. (1991) History of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, 1915‚Äì1990. London: School of Slavonic and East European Studies. p. 31. Later, Galton's tenure at SSEES included the directorships of William Rose and George Bolsover. While at SSEES, Galton got to know D.S. Mirsky (\\"Prince Mirsky\\") well. She wrote that they dined together when Mirsky had money and he indulged his prodigious appetite for food and drink and recited poetry in one of his four languages while she sipped wine. Mirsky's letters to Galton from Moscow from 1932, when he returned to the USSR, to 1937, when he was arrested, were published in the Oxford Slavonic Papers in 1996. Mirsky died in a gulag in 1939.The strange case of D.S. Mirsky. Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, January 2002. Retrieved 25 February 2016. Political activity The cover of Dorothy Galton's security services file at the British National Archives From 1932 to 1936, Galton was an active member of the Communist Party of Great Britain in the St Pancras branch. In August 1934 she visited Leningrad on the SS SibierBeekeeper was spy for Stalin. Duncan Gardham, The Telegraph, 1 September 2009. Retrieved 22 January 2016. and made an additional visit in 1935‚Äì36 with Bernard Pares who wrote it up in Moscow admits a critic (1936).Roberts, p. 38. From 1936, however, she stopped her political work in favour of \\"special research work\\", apparently on the orders of senior party officials. The British security services continued to monitor Galton throughout the 1930s, reporting in their files on her movements, contacts, correspondence and telephone calls which they intercepted. Second World War During the Second World War, SSEES was partly moved to Oxford to avoid the bombing of London. Galton remained in London in the school's temporary home at 1 Thornhaugh Street. When that building was hit by a bomb on the night of 10‚Äì11 May 1941, all the school's administrative records were destroyed but \\"by good fortune\\" Galton had a list of the names and addresses of all the staff and students at home.Roberts, p. 43. In 1941, Galton organised a Slavonic studies summer school in Oxford that was attended by 78 students. The summer schools continued in various location in Britain until 1950 when the last one was held in Paris.Roberts, p. 44. It is not clear whether Galton organised them all. From May to July 1945 she toured American universities following an invitation from the Rockefeller Foundation and subsequently prepared a report for them on the state of Slavic studies in the universities of the United States, the manuscript of which is held in the SSEES library along with a 59-page diary of her trip. In August 1942, British police of Special Branch made \\"discreet inquiries\\" around Galton's home in Hampstead, which they noted was an area \\"which is well populated with persons of communist type and sympathies\\". Reports stated that she was 5 ft 8ins or 9ins tall, and \\"well built and athletic, fresh complexion, dark bobbed hair, oval face, sharp features, wears spectacles, wears no hat\\". The MI6 double agent Kim Philby, who was also working for the Russians, enquired what the British Security Services knew about Galton. According to Philby, the FBI thought that Galton had been \\"instrumental in effecting reconciliation\\" between Josef Stalin and Sir Bernard Pares. Roger Hollis, later director general of MI5 and also suspected by some of having been a Russian spy, wrote to Philby detailing Galton's visits to Russia in 1934 and with Pares in 1935‚Äì1936. He stated that Galton had been told by a Communist Party superior in 1936 to stop her political work in favour of \\"special research work\\". In September 1946, MI5 wrote again to Philby saying that in their opinion the FBI should ignore Pares and pay attention to Galton instead. Post-war A modern view of South Hill Park Gardens, Hampstead, where Galton lived in the 1940s Galton remained an object of interest to the British security services in the post-war years. In February 1947, they noted that the mathematician, professor Hyman Levy, described by the security services as a \\"well known communist\\" had moved in with Galton at her home at 15 South Hill Park Gardens, Hampstead. Also in 1947, she was involved in the Joint Services School of Languages which caused some concern in official channels given Galton's political views. Through the interception of Galton's mail, which continued until 1952, they learned that she had rejoined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950. In April 1952, Galton's father died.\\"Mr. F.W. Galton\\", The Times, 12 April 1952, p. 8. Her mother died in February 1953Probate Calendar 1953. Retrieved 22 February 2016. and around this time she seems to have come into some money. The security services noted that she had acquired a cottage near Windsor and \\"She goes down to it every weekend on her mini-motorcycle.\\" Later they noted that she was moving to a cottage in Parndon, Essex, which was part-owned by her brother-in-law, Albert Evans, the Labour Party member of Parliament for South West Islington, and she had \\"disposed of her motor-scooter and invested in a car.\\" Despite the long- running suspicions of the security services that Galton was a Russian spy or at least a plant of the Communist Party of Great Britain, they were never able to prove anything.Dorothy, a secretary and a spy? Richard Osley, Camden New Journal, 3 September 2009. Retrieved 22 January 2016. Character Opinions were divided over Galton's character. She was described by Karl Showler of the International Bee Research Association as having a gift for languages and administration, and a \\"warm personality\\", and by an MI5 informant as \\"a most unpleasant and seriously unbalanced woman and ... by no means efficient\\". She was described in The Times as \\"formidable\\" and \\"autocratic\\" but also having many friends and willing to help those in need. Olga Crisp, a former student at SSEES, described Galton as shy and forthright and avoiding eye-contact. Galton told Crisp, an exile from Poland, that she thought it was Crisp's duty to return to Poland but as she was clearly determined to stay in Britain, she would do what she could to help her, which she did.\\"Dorothy Galton\\", Olga Crisp, The Times, 12 October 1992, p. 17. Retirement and death Galton retired from SSEES in December 1961. She was replaced by former army officer and alumnus of SSEES, Ronald Whitworth.Roberts, p. 65. She spent her retirement in Norfolk and devoted herself to the study of beekeeping, particularly in Russia, an interest that she first developed in the 1950s. In 1971 the Bee Research Association published her book A survey of a thousand years of beekeeping in Russia, with a foreword by Professor Robert E.F. Smith. In 1987, The International Bee Research Association awarded her honorary membership. Her second book, The bee-hive: An enquiry into its origin and history (1982) theorised a \\"civilisation of the bee\\" which she thought contributed to the development of the languages of Eurasia. Her finally work, Bees, honey and beeswax in early historical times, was completed not long before her death\\"Dorothy Galton\\", The Times, 6 October 1992, p. 15. but unpublished and the manuscript of it is now lost.Appeal over spy suspect Dorothy's lost manuscript. Richard Osley, Camden New Journal, 11 January 2016. Retrieved 22 January 2016. Galton was active in her local Labour Party branch, travelled to Russia, and taught English at the University of Budapest. In 1972 she had a letter published in The Times from her home at Garden House, Peacock Lane, Holt, Norfolk, in which she condemned proposed changes to the status of SSEES as another example of \\"the distasteful, competitive world in which we have to live.\\"\\"Slavonic Studies School\\", Dorothy Galton, The Times, 25 January 1972, p.15. At the age of nearly 90, she who had never owned a home or had a bank account because she considered interest immoral, inherited a property and a sum of money and had to learn to manage both. Dorothy Galton died at her home, 3 Hooks Hill Road, Sheringham, Norfolk, on 27 August 1992. She had been suffering from stomach cancer. She donated her body to medical research. She did not marry and left no descendants. Papers Papers relating to Dorothy Galton are held at the SSEES library as the Galton Collection.Catalogue of Galton Collection.

Since the early 1970s, she has taken a special interest in the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, making a careful analysis of his recorded performances as a pianist. Two books document the results of her work: Dmitri Shostakovich, Pianist and Shostakovich's Music for Piano Solo, Interpretation and Performance. She also contributed a chapter on piano music to A Shostakovich Companion, edited by Michael Mishra. Biography Moshevich was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, in 1949, where she studied at the school of Professional Music for Gifted Children. From 1967, she studied piano at the Gnessin Institute in Moscow under the Soviet master Naum Shtarkman. She emigrated to Israel in 1975, continuing her studies in musicology under Joachim Braun at the Bar Ilan University (1976‚Äì78) while teaching at Jerusalem's Rubin Academy. She also gave public performances as a soloist and accompanist, including recordings for the Israel Broadcasting Authority. She often played pieces by Shostakovich. She moved to South Africa in 1981, where she studied and taught at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and participated in broadcasts for the South African Broadcasting Corporation. She was granted scholarships from the University of Witwatersrand, the Abraham and Olga Lipman Fund and the South African Jewish Board of Deputies Benjamin Newman Bursary (1983‚Äì84). Shostakovich research Moshevich's interest in Shostakovich goes back to the early 1970s when she was studying at the Gnessin Institute. She was surprised to find that, despite generally accepted views to the contrary, early recordings of his music demonstrated that his piano performances compared favourably with those of the great Soviet pianists. On that basis, she built up and analysed an extensive collection of his recordings. In 1987, while at Witwatersrand, she completed a 120-page doctoral thesis titled \\"Shostakovich as Interpreter of His Own Music: a Study of Recorded Performances\\". In Dmitri Shostakovich, Pianist, Moshevich reviews the composer's recordings as well as the reception of his performances. The book has received mixed reviews. Shostakovich expert David Fanning describes it as \\"richly rewarding\\" when considered as \\"an enthusiastic fact-gathering mission\\" but criticises it for a failure to develop a \\"richer critical vocabulary to articulate the strengths in his playing\\". Writing in DSCH Journal, Nigel Papworth compliments the work on its coverage of important gaps in the composer's biography and its careful attention to detail. By contrast, Mark Mazullo criticizes the work as presenting a \\"superficial commentary\\" on the music of Shostakovich although he admits it contains some new reminiscences and quotes which unfortunately are not adequately discussed. She has also published on pianist Glenn Gould's Russian tour. Family Moshevich is the daughter of Mark and Matlia (Matilda) Moshevich and is married to Arik Moshevich (n√©e Poupko). Her maiden name is thus the same as her married name. She has two children: Avital (Tali) Kellerstein and Jonathan.

History In the middle of the nineteenth century the counties of Galloway, Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire (now all part of the administrative region of Dumfries and Galloway) were devoted to agriculture but lacked efficient land communications links with the rest of the United Kingdom. Mail from the northern part of England and Scotland to Ireland passed this way through the ports of Portpatrick and Donaghadee, but the poor roads made the passage difficult.Fryer, C E J, The Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railways, The Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway (GD&CR;) was authorised in 1846, and the authorisation appears to have included a branch from Dumfries to Kirkcudbright, but the shortage of money at that time led to abandonment of the plans for the branch.First Report of the Directors of the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway, quoted in Fryer.Highet, Campbell, The Glasgow & South-Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965 The line opened on 7 November 1859 and was immediately commercially successful; the preference share dividend was paid in full, and sufficient surplus enabled a 1% dividend to be paid on ordinary shares in the first full year. The line was operated from the outset by the G&SWR.; In 1861 the Portpatrick Railway completed a connection from Castle Douglas to Stranraer and Portpatrick, and through traffic ran from Carlisle and points south and east over the CD&DR; line. The Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway was amalgamated with the Glasgow and South Western Railway on 1 August 1865, by the terms of the G.&S.W.R.; Amalgamation Act of 5 July 1865. In the twentieth century the amalgamated G&SWR; formed part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1923 grouping of the railways. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway then became part of British Railways. The station was closed for passenger traffic on 1 March 1939Passengers No More by G.Daniels and L.Dench but trains continued to pass the station until the line was substantially closed, under the Beeching Axe, on 14 June 1965. The section between Maxwelltown and Dumfries remained open to serve an oil depot, but this section of line was subsequently closed and lifted and is a cycleway/footpath.

Since their introduction, the fees have been reformed multiple times by several bills, with the cap on fees notably rising to ¬£9,000 a year for the 2012‚Äì13 academic year. Background=Fees prior to 1962= Before the Education Act 1962 fees existed in the United Kingdom- usually making up around a third of a university's income, the remainder supported by state subsidies and other sources of income. =1962‚Äì1998= David Eccles, Secretary of State for Education, under Harold Macmillan's Conservative Government, published the Education Act 1962, which granted an exemption for \\"ordinarily resident\\", full-time, students from University tuition fees, along with introducing a right to a means-tested maintenance grant. Fees remained in place for part- time and non-resident (overseas) students. The act remained in place till repealed in 1998.http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy- papers/papers/university-fees-in-historical-perspective =Dearing Report= In May 1996, Gillian Shephard, Secretary of State for Education and Employment, commissioned an inquiry, led by the then Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, Sir Ron Dearing, into the funding of British higher education over the next 20 years. This National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education reported to the new Labour Government, in the summer of 1997, stating additional billions of funding would be needed over the period, including ¬£350 million in 1998-9 and ¬£565 million in 1999‚Äì2000, in order to expand student enrolment, provide more support for part-time students and ensure an adequate infrastructure. The committee, as part of its brief, had controversially investigated the possibility of Students contributing to the cost of this expansion, either through Loans, a Graduate tax, Deferred contributions or means testing state assistance, as their report notes: > 20.40 We do not underestimate the strength of feeling on the issue of > seeking a contribution towards tuition costs: nor do we dispute the logic of > the arguments put forward. A detailed assessment of the issues has, however, > convinced us that the arguments in favour of a contribution to tuition costs > from graduates in work are strong, if not widely appreciated. They relate to > equity between social groups, broadening participation, equity with part- > time students in higher education and in further education, strengthening > the student role in higher education, and identifying a new source of income > that can be ring-fenced for higher education. 20.41 We have, therefore, > analysed the implications of a range of options against the criteria set out > in paragraph 20.2. There is a wide array of options from which to choose, > ranging from asking graduates to contribute only to their living costs > through to asking all graduates to contribute to their tuition costs. We > have chosen to examine four options in depth The inquiry favoured means tested tuition fees and the continuation of the means tested maintenance grants as well as student loans. It recommended that graduates made a flat rate contribution of 25 percent of the cost of higher education tuition and that a mechanism for paying for this should be established by 1998‚Äì9. Following the publication of the report, the Labour education secretary David Blunkett proposed the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, on 26 November 1997, to introduce means tested tuition fees from September 1998. He also announced that the student maintenance grant would be abolished and replaced by student loans.Fazackerley, A.& Chant, J.\\"More Fees Please - The Future of university fees for undergraduate students page 19Bolton, J.\\"Library of the House of Commons, \\"Value of Student Maintenance Support\\" Page 2, section 1.1 The government issued a response entitled \\"Higher Education in the 21st Century\\" to the Dearing Report. It stated \\"The Government plans to introduce an annual tuition fee of ¬£1,000, representing about a quarter of the average cost of a course. Tuition will continue to be free for students from lower income families. Other full-time students will pay up to ¬£1,000 per year depending on parental income. The cost of the fees will be balanced by increased loans for maintenance, also related to parental income. The overall effect will be that the total contribution required from the parents will be no greater than it is now.\\"Bolton, Paul. \\"Tuition Fee Statistics\\", Library of the House of Commons, 23 November 2010, page 2, section 1.1 David Blunkett United Kingdom Secretary of State for Education and Employment 1997-2001 introduced tuition fees of ¬£1000 a year. Introduction of the fees: The Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 The teaching and higher education bill was passed into law on 16 July 1998. In addition to introducing tuition fees, it established General Teaching Councils in England and Wales, introduced measures to reform the teaching profession and gave a provision for certain young workers to have time off for study. Prior to the passing of the act, the House of Lords passed three successive amendments to the bill which would have meant that English, Welsh and Northern Irish students studying in Scotland would pay a total of ¬£3,000 for a four-year course to bring them in line with Scottish students. The amendments were overturned in the Commons but only after David Blunkett promised an independent review of tuition fees and how they operated in Scotland. The length of a typical honours degree in Scotland was four years compared to three years elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The difference presented a potential anomaly for when fees were introduced. It meant that students studying at Scottish universities would be charged an extra year of tuition fees compared with students studying a comparable course elsewhere in the UK. An independent review was led by Sir George Quigley, the Chairman of Ulster Bank, looked into the issue and reported on 29 March 2000. It recommended that a fees concession should be given to students studying at Scottish universities in the final year of a four-year honours degree, if they were domiciled in other parts of the UK. It also recommended that the cost of meeting this provision should be born by the newly established Scottish Executive. The recommendations of the report were accepted by the executive at an estimated cost of between ¬£2.5 million and ¬£3.2 million a year.The Independent review into the funding of tuition fees in Scotland (The Quigley Report) was established as part of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 which introduced tuition fees in the UK. However following the passing of the Scotland Act 1998 devolved parliament was established in Scotland. The first meeting of the new Scottish executive was held on 12 May 1999 with responsibility for tuition fees passing from the parliament in Westminster to Scotland. The Quigley report published on 29 March 2000 meant that its recommendations were now the responsibility of the Scottish and not the Westminster governments House of Commons - The Scottish Debate =Payment arrangements= The act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned. Students whose families earned less than ¬£23,000 would be exempt from fees whilst those families earning between ¬£23,000 and ¬£35,000 a year would be charged a percentage of the fees on a sliding scale. Those families who earned over ¬£35,000 a year would be charged the full fees which amounted to ¬£1,000 a year. The maximum fees rose in line with inflation, reaching ¬£1225 in 2007‚Äì08. Starting with 1999‚Äì2000, maintenance grants for living expenses would also be replaced with loans and paid back at a rate of 9 percent of a graduate's income above ¬£10,000. All loans would be government funded and administered by the Student Loans Company, the organisation responsible for administering loans throughout the UK.The Student Loans Company was established in order to administer the Student Loans Scheme introduced as a result of the Education (Student Loans) Act 1990 and the Education (Student Loans) Northern Ireland Order 1990. It administers tuition fee loans to cover the cost of tuition fees; maintenance loans to cover the cost of living expenses; grants for living costs to cover the cost of living expenses and bursaries and scholarships from universities. It also administers the repayment of loans through the tax system via a method known as income-contingent repayment (ICR) meaning that the obligation to repay the loan is dependent on the gross income of the account holder Student Loans Company - About Student FinanceStudent Loans Company - Remit =Reaction to the introduction of tuition fees= March against fees, November 2000 The decision signalled the end of the principle of free higher education and was met with concern by some in the Labour Party. Former Labour education secretary Ted Short said that he was ashamed to be a member of the party and Ken Livingstone accused ministers of \\"whipping away a ladder of opportunity which they themselves had climbed\\". On the other side of the argument top universities in the United Kingdom actually wanted to raise tuition fees further so that they could compete more on the global stage. Some universities argued for a \\"United States-style\\" system where institutions were able to charge fees at whatever rate the \\"market will bear\\". Howard Newby, the President of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said that the challenge for universities would be in ensuring new income was \\"recycled\\" into bursaries for poorer students. Blunkett said that after the next general election it would be likely that there would be another debate on the issue revisiting the issue of university funding but that whilst he was Secretary of State there would be no top up fees. Howard Newby acknowledged that any further changes to the public funding of universities would need to wait \\"until after the General Election\\" although he added \\"Afterwards, the question is how to bring more resources into higher education. Fees have to be part of the equation.\\" Post-devolution developments in the countries of the UK=Scotland= Following the passing of the Scotland Act 1998, devolved government was established in Scotland with the first meeting of the new Scottish Parliament taking place on 12 May 1999. The parliament had been given primary legislative powers meaning that over many areas elected representatives were able to pass their own laws. In particular its responsibilities included student fees, school standards and the training and supply of teachers. The Cubie Report University funding became an issue following Scottish devolution when the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government. The Liberal Democrats had made tuition fees a \\"non-negotiable\\" element of their election manifesto and therefore a potential stumbling block to forming the coalition. Labour, the majority party in the coalition had, only one year previously, introduced tuition fees in the United Kingdom of up to ¬£1000 a year and had also abolished maintenance grants. The Cubie committee led by the lawyer Andrew Cubie was formed in July 1999 to look into the funding of higher education in Scotland to try to find a solution to the issue of student financing which threatened to destabilise the coalition. =Recommendations of the Cubie report= The Cubie report recommended that tuition fees should be replaced with an endowment scheme with the Scottish Executive paying the fees up front with students only required to pay back ¬£3,000 worth of fees when their earnings reached ¬£25,000. It also recommended that poorer students would be entitled to a bursary similar to the old maintenance grant. The estimated cost to the Scottish government of the recommendations were set at ¬£71 million. In the end the government announced that students would only pay back ¬£2,000 of their fees but starting when their earnings reached ¬£10,000 a significant drop on the recommended ¬£25,000. With such changes, the Scottish executive estimated that the scheme would cost ¬£50 million. =Response to the Cubie report= Speaking following the publication of the report the Liberal Democrats deputy first minister Jim Wallace said \\"we welcome the fact that Cubie recommends the abolition of tuition fees. This remains the party's policy... Andrew Cubie and his team have done a thorough job over the last six months. As he himself says, the extent of the need for change would not have been identified if the committee had not been established.\\" The Scottish National Party's (SNP) John Swinney described the report as a \\"humiliation\\" for Labour saying that it left their policy on student financing in \\"tartan tatters\\". The Conservatives Brian Monteith was sceptical of the report saying \\"the Cubie Committee says it is abolishing tuition fees but they will be replaced with a graduate tax that recovers exactly the same amount that would have been paid in fees.\\" The findings of the report were considered by a joint ministerial working group established by Scottish First Minister Donald Dewar. The abolition of tuition fees would commence in August 2000 with the endowment scheme taking their place the following year. Scottish students studying elsewhere in the United Kingdom would still be required to pay fees but Scottish students choosing to study in Scotland would not. English, Welsh and Northern Irish students studying in Scotland would be liable to pay tuition fees but would not be required to pay the graduate endowment. Students from outside the United Kingdom but from within the European Union would not be required to pay tuition fees if studying in Scotland but would be required to pay the graduate endowment upon graduation. In order to qualify as a Scottish student and be exempted from paying tuition fees, the student must have lived in Scotland for at least three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of the course. Students would also be exempt if they were classed as \\"ordinarily resident\\" in the country on the first day of their course. This meant that those students who had moved to Scotland for a reason other than study would also be exempt. The graduate endowment and its abolition The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Act 2001 established the criteria by which the graduate endowment would be paid. Scottish domiciled or European Union students from outside the United Kingdom\\\\- \\"The Scottish Parliament information centre\\", \\"The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Bill\\", \\"research paper 00-18\\", \\"page 2\\" The GE will be paid by those who have undertaken a full-time first degree course at an institution funded by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council or the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. This is in recognition of the fact that many students study for their first degree at a further education college. Regulations to be made under the Bill will establish further criteria for eligibility: Liable individuals will be: \\\\- Scottish-domiciled or EU students. \\\\- Students whose full-time degree study exceeds a specified minimum period. \\\\- Those who have satisfied the criteria for being awarded a degree ‚Äì i.e. to prevent students from not graduating when they complete their course.\\"\\"page 2\\" who had undertaken a first full-time degree course on or after 1 August 2001 were eligible to pay the endowment.\\"The Scottish Parliament information centre\\"\\"The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Bill\\", \\"research paper 00-18\\"\\"page 2-3\\" On completion of their degree, students would pay a fixed amount initially set by the Scottish government at ¬£2000 and later rising to ¬£2289 for students commencing their studies during the academic year of 2006‚Äì07. The amount would become payable after the student successfully completed their degree and could be paid either by taking out a student loan, paying a lump sum or by a combination of both. The first students began paying back the endowment on 1 April 2005. Not all students had to pay. Those taking qualifications below degree level were exempt as were mature students over the age of 25, lone parents in receipt of a lone parent grant and those in receipt of Disabled Student Allowance. Students who dropped out of university would also not have to pay as they would be allowed \\"one false start\\". Certain courses, such as teacher training courses, were also exempt from the endowment. In the summer of 2007, the Scottish government proposed the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill that would scrap the graduate endowment altogether. It meant that no future students would pay the endowment and that would also apply to graduates who graduated on or after 1 April 2007.Bolton, Paul. \\"Tuition Fee Statistics\\" , Library of the House of Commons, 23 November 2010, page 3, section 1.4 On 28 February 2008 the bill was approved in a move which restored free higher education in Scotland. The Scottish education secretary Fiona Hyslop speaking at the time said \\"We believe access to education should be based on ability to learn, not ability to pay. Today's removal of the graduate endowment fee is great news for current and future students and last year's graduates, helping to significantly reduce their debt burden.\\" Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin however said that its abolition would not tackle student poverty. Voting against the measure she said that ministers had \\"failed miserably\\" to produce evidence that scrapping the endowment would increase the numbers of people going to university. =Wales= Following devolution, the Welsh Assembly was given what were known as \\"secondary legislative powers\\" which meant that unlike their Scottish counterparts, they were only able to vary some laws set by Parliament in London. The assembly could vary specified devolved issues including setting and monitoring school standards, the content of the national curriculum and the training and supply of teachers. The cap on the amount of tuition fees that Welsh universities could charge rose to ¬£3000 in the academic year of 2007-08 bringing Wales in line with England and Northern Ireland although the Welsh Assembly up until 2010-11 gave all Welsh students studying in Wales a grant of ¬£1890 towards their fees. Maintenance grants in Wales Maintenance grants, initially up to ¬£1,500 were re-introduced by the Welsh Government in 2002 in a move that was, at the time, seen to put pressure on the United Kingdom government who still favoured the use of student loans. The Welsh education secretary, Labour's Jane Davidson, said that ¬£41 million had been ring-fenced for less well off families meaning that up to 250,000 Welsh students would be eligible for a means-tested grant of up to ¬£1,500. Welsh students studying outside Wales would also still be eligible for the grants if studying within the United Kingdom. Students from the rest of the United Kingdom or the European Union however would not be eligible for assistance from the Welsh Government if studying in Wales. At the time the National Union of Students president Owain James welcomed the move saying \\"this is a great victory for Welsh students.... Maintenance grants are crucial to keep students in education.\\" Speaking about the re-introduction of maintenance grants, the Conservatives education spokesperson Jonathon Morgan said that Labour had performed a U-turn and said that the party should apologise for introducing tuition fees in the first place. The maximum maintenance grant provided by the Welsh Assembly has since risen to over ¬£5000. =England=Introduction of variable tuition fees Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Blair won a key vote on the introduction of variable tuition fees in 2003 with the votes of Scottish MPs making the difference On 22 January 2003 the new Labour education secretary Charles Clarke published a white paper with proposals allowing universities to set their own tuition fees up to a cap of ¬£3,000 a year. The proposal was controversial as during the election campaign for the 2001 General Election their manifesto stated that Labour \\"will not introduce top-up fees and has legislated against them.\\" The white paper stated that the fees would only be repaid once the graduate earned over ¬£15,000 a year. The likelihood of a backbench rebellion from Labour MPs forced Clarke to introduce a number of concessions to the rebels in order to avoid a Commons defeat in a vote held on 27 January 2004. Amendments to the bill included an increase in the amount poorer students could claim in a maintenance grant, a promise to review the ¬£3,000 cap after three years and the promise to write off all student debt after 25 years.Think Money - Student Debt Guide - Is there a \`cut-off point\` for Student Loan repayments?\\"Your Student Loan will eventually be written off if you never earn enough to make payments, or if you haven\`t repaid the full amount within a certain period. For loans issued before September 2006, any remaining debt will be written off when you reach 65, while loans issued after September 2006 will be written off 25 years after the first April of your graduation.\\" Eventually the vote was passed with Labour winning by 316 votes to 311 with 71 Labour MPs voting against and 19 Labour MPs abstaining. The result provided relief for Tony Blair in what had been seen as his biggest test yet as Prime Minister. Education Secretary Clarke said \\"had we lost it, it would have been a blow to our authority but as it is we have the ability to take the legislation forward.\\" The Conservatives shadow education and health secretary Tim Yeo said the result was an \\"utter humiliation\\" for ministers and said that the vote had only been won because of the votes of Scottish MPs who had voted to impose fees on English students which would not apply north of the border. The Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said that \\"nobody has emerged from this shabby compromise with any credit.\\" He added \\"it took a dodgy deal between the prime minister, the chancellor and backbenchers to get this Bill through.\\" The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) however said before the vote that the plans were \\"essential\\" for the revitalisation of British universities. University vice-chancellors meanwhile had previously warned the government that universities were facing a shortfall in funding. In their submission to the governments 2004 comprehensive spending review, the lobby group Universities UK requested a further ¬£8.79 billion,Universities UK \\"Achieving our Vision - 2004 spending review submission for England and Northern Ireland\\" page 20 section 1.5 a figure it was feared would grow should legislation to increase tuition fees fail. Such was the level of underfunding, vice chancellors argued, and assuming that all universities would charge the full ¬£3,000 a year, the measures would only \\"ameliorate, not solve, the funding crisis\\" recouping only ¬£1.4 billion extra revenue a year. Michael Driscoll, chair of the Coalition of Modern Universities, said \\"Universities face a financial black hole, but the real black hole is in teaching. We do not have enough money to pay our staff.\\" =Scottish MP vote controversy= The vote on 27 January 2004 caused controversy as, because of the close nature of the result, the votes of MPs with constituencies in Scotland proved crucial in terms of getting it through. With university funding devolved in Scotland, the result of any increase in tuition fees would not affect students who chose to live and study in Scotland. Peter Duncan, the Conservatives' only Scottish MP, had abstained from the vote saying \\"This is a dark day for British democracy, and the actions of Scottish MPs are reprehensible.... The constitutionally cavalier actions of Scottish MPs undermine the devolution settlement and play into the hands of the separatists on both sides of the border.... Those Scottish MPs who walked through the lobbies today should hang their heads in shame.\\" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Yeo said in a point of order \\"It is completely wrong that a bill which imposes higher charges on students attending the English universities should only be carried by this house using the votes of Scottish MPs when the students attending universities in the constituencies of those Scottish MPs do not have to pay those higher charges.\\" In all 46 Scottish Labour MPs voted with the government with the 5 SNP and 10 Liberal Democrat MPs representing constituencies in Scotland voting against. Labour's Frank Doran, a Scottish MP who voted with the government said \\"my fundamental objections were about the variable fees and the effect on Scottish universities, but I think the effect of the variable fees has been mitigated in a huge way by the various concessions the government has made.\\" =Higher Education Act 2004= On 1 July 2004 legislation to enable the introduction of variable tuition fees was given royal assent and became the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, universities in England could begin to charge variable fees of up to ¬£3000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006‚Äì07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006‚Äì07 and introduced in Wales in 2007‚Äì08. In 2009‚Äì10 the cap rose to ¬£3225 a year to take account of inflation. Students from the European Union (EU) would be eligible for the same level of tuition fees as students from within the United Kingdom. Students from outside the EU would have to pay the fees set by the individual university. To cover the cost of the fees UK and EU students could take out a tuition fee loan meaning that there would be no requirement to pay fees upfront.Bolton, Paul. \\"Tuition Fee Statistics\\" , Library of the House of Commons, 23 November 2010, page 2, section 1.2 The loan, which would not depend on household income, would be paid directly to the university or college from the student loans company. The act also established the Office for Fair Access (OFFA) in an effort to ensure that the \\"introduction of higher tuition fees in 2007-08 did not deter people from entering higher education for financial reasons\\". It also would ensure that \\"universities and colleges were explicitly committed to increasing participation in higher education among under-represented groups\\". The fees also became known as top up fees as prior to September 2006 the amount paid for tuition would be a flat rate whereas from September 2006 the fees became variable and would help universities to \\"top up\\" the shortfall in funding to cover the cost of certain degrees. Speaking about the introduction of variable tuition fees in 2005, Higher Education Minister Bill Rammell, claimed that the changes were necessary saying \\"I think we have to get real. In an ideal world you wouldn't bring in these changes, but we don't live in an ideal world. To maintain and develop a world class system of higher education would cost the equivalent of 3p or 4p on the standard rate of tax\\". He elsewhere provided a different estimate stating that to replace the income from top-up fees, estimated by the government to be ¬£1.4 billion., would necessitate a requirement \\"to put up income tax by 3%\\" Calls for review in university funding In their Changing Landscapes report published in 2009, Universities UK said that \\"in practice, although institutions theoretically had the choice whether to charge the full tuition fee, almost all chose to set the fee at the ¬£3,000 cap\\".Universities UK  changing landscapes report Page 7 It also said that the \\"current fee arrangements\\" had not \\"created an economic market in which the price of an institution is a significant factor in how potential students choose the institution they want to go to and in which institutions compete on price to attract students.\\" In their Conclusions on the Changing Market they said that raising tuition fees to ¬£5,000 a year would be just the \\"maintenance of the status quo\\" and claimed that \\"students are insensitive to tuition fees below this level.\\" The report suggested that \\"increasing fees above ¬£5,000 would lead more and more institutions to review their practice of setting fees below the cap\\".Universities UK  changing landscapes report page 18, section 2.4 Responding to the report Wendy Piatt, Director General of the Russell Group who represent 20 British universities, said \\"There is a growing consensus that without increased investment, there is a real danger that the success of our world-leading universities will not be sustained. In a difficult economic climate there is even greater urgency to find additional funding\\". She quoted research from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) which said that universities needed an additional 15-20 percent worth of funding for current teaching levels to be sustained and suggested that an increase in tuition fees should be something that should be an option as the increase in 2006 had no adverse impact on recruitment. Browne Review Peter Mandelson UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills 2009‚Äì2010 commissioned a review into fees and university funding to be published after the 2010 general election On 9 November 2009 Business Secretary Peter Mandelson announced a further review into fees and university funding in England, led by John Browne, former chief executive of BP. Browne, a cross-bencher in the House of Lords and also known as Lord Browne of Madingley, was joined on his panel by David Eastwood, vice- chancellor of the University of Birmingham and Julia King, vice-chancellor of Aston University as well as a number of other professionals.The Times - Lord Browne of Madingley heads team to look at raising tuition fees Members on the Browne inquiry were Lord Browne of Madingley former chairman of BP; Sir Michael Barber former chief advisor to David Blunkett; Diane Coyle former journalist and Treasury economist; Professor David Eastwood vice chancellor of Birmingham university; Julia King vice chancellor of Aston university, Peter Sands chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank, Rajay Naik UK board member of the Big Lottery Fund Speaking at the launch, Mandelson said that the review would take into account the goal of widening participation in higher education, the need for affordability and the desire to simplify the student- support system. He said that variable tuition fees currently provided universities with a secure income of ¬£1.3 billion a year and \\"since they were introduced, student numbers have continued to rise, along with the numbers coming from lower-income backgrounds.\\" The review would look at funding for both full-time and part-time students, considering tuition fees and alternatives to them, such as a graduate tax. Speaking on the launch of the review, National Union of Students President Wes Streeting said \\"there is a real danger that this review will pave the way for higher fees and a market in prices that would see poorer students priced out of more prestigious universities and other students and universities consigned to the 'bargain basement'\\". However, the Russell Group's Wendy Piatt argued that the current level of funding was inadequate, saying \\"as universities are facing severe economic conditions and ferocious global competition it is clear that the status quo is not viable\\". =Political background prior to review publication= Following the 2010 general election on 6 May 2010 no one party commanded a majority in the House of Commons and so following negotiations the Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties formed a coalition government.The Times  Britain wakes up to a hung parliament With David Cameron installed as Prime Minister and Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister the two men produced a coalition agreement setting out how the two parties would work together. In response to the issue of university funding and higher education, the agreement said that higher education policy would have to await the outcome of the Browne report which had not yet been published. The agreement also made mention of the desire to increase the number of university places available. For the Liberal Democrats the findings of the review were a big unknown and potentially problematic for the party as they had made the abolition of student tuition fees within a period of six years one of their manifesto commitments and many of the party's MPs had signed a National Union of Students pledge stating that they would not vote for any increase in tuition fees. As a result of this potential conflict, the agreement stipulated that the Liberal Democrats could abstain on any vote which may require fees to be increased. =Findings and recommendations of the review= The Browne Review into the future of Higher Education Funding published its report on 12 October 2010 in a document entitled Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education. The report based its recommendations on six principles which were: *More investment should be available for Higher Education *Student choice should be increased *Everyone who has the potential should be able to benefit from Higher Education *No-one should have to pay until they start work *When payments are made they should be affordable *Part- time students should be treated the same as full-time students for the costs of learning The main recommendations of the report were: *Removing the cap of ¬£3,290 a year that universities could charge for tuition *Raising the point at which tuition fees loans are paid back from ¬£15,000 to ¬£21,000 a year *Changing the repayment scheme such that loans were only to be paid back at nine per cent of any income earned over ¬£21,000 *Giving part-time students equal entitlement to tuition under the Student Finance Plan =Reaction to the Browne Report= The recommendations contained within the report issued by the Browne commission contained one particularly controversial area in the removal of the cap on tuition fees. Lord Browne however in an interview with BBC Breakfast predicted that few institutions would put fees up very high. For the Liberal Democrats in particular it was predicted that the review would cause deep political divisions both within their own party and within the coalition government as many had signed a pledge promising not to vote for any increase in tuition fees prior to the election. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, said the proposals were \\"probably on the right lines\\" whilst the Liberal Youth section of the party described the fee rise as a \\"disaster\\". Backbench Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland immediately said he would vote against the plan. Within the media the Financial Times called the report by Lord Browne a \\"genuinely radical document that would, if implemented, lead to a free-market revolution in higher education provision\\". David Blackburn of the Spectator called the proposals a \\"sustainable and permanent solution\\" and described the plan as \\"progressive\\". The Guardian Martin Hall however said that there would be a \\"social cost of variable tuition fees\\" and said that institutions rated highest in the league tables would be able to charge more and so force out poorer students. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, also defended the report saying \\"Everybody wants the same thing, not only sustainable funding for universities, but also a system where the teaching you receive at university, the upfront costs of it are free at the point of use, that we encourage more students from poor backgrounds into university than is presently the case and, crucially, that when people pay back for their university tuition, they only do it when they can afford to do it and that people who earn more pay a bit more back than others. I think that is a fair and sustainable approach and that is what we are looking for in the Browne report today.\\" For Labour, the shadow Business Secretary John Denham said that the report deserved \\"careful study\\" and said that it was \\"right that some students make some contribution towards their education\\". However he added \\"We are concerned that many graduates will be shackled by debt for the majority of their working lives; that those on middle incomes in typical graduate jobs may pay more than their fair share and the highest earners will pay less and be free of debt much earlier.\\" Vince Cable United Kingdom Business Secretary (2010-2015) in charge of implementing the changes resulting from the Browne review =Government response= On 3 November 2010 the government responded to the review by making a number of adjustments to the recommendations, the main one being the rejection of Browne's recommendation that the cap to Universities be completely lifted, instead agreeing a ¬£9,000 per year cap. In terms of paying back the loan, Browne had suggested a flat rate of interest should be charged at 2.2 per cent plus inflation. On this the government opted for a tapered rate which would rise to 3 per cent depending on earnings in an effort to make the system more progressive. The earnings limit at which loans would begin to be paid back would rise in line with the Browne recommendations from ¬£15,000 to ¬£21,000.Universities UK  Government response to the Browne report Business Secretary Vince Cable said that access to higher education would be on the basis of ability and not the ability to pay. He said \\"no-one will have to pay up-front tuition fees. We are extending loans for the cost of tuition to the majority of part-time students. No one will contribute until they can afford to do so ‚Äì when they are in well paid jobs ... The graduate contribution system that we have designed will protect the lowest earning graduates and ensure that their contributions are linked to their ability to pay; indeed, under our new more progressive repayment system, 25%, maybe as many as 30% according to the IFS, of graduates with the lowest lifetime earnings will pay back less than they do now.\\" David Willetts, the Universities Minister claimed that the \\"progressive package\\" would put universities on a sustainable footing with extra freedoms and less bureaucracy. However, in return for that he stated that there would be \\"greater choice for students with a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\\" =Other criticism= The UK Youth Parliament, an affiliate of the British Youth Council also responded to the Browne Review. Their criticism centred around both the way in which the review was conducted and the conclusion it reached. The UK Youth Parliament believed that lifting the cap on University tuition fees would force young people to make \\"financially driven choices when it comes to choosing where and what to study\\". Former Member of UK Youth Parliament and UKYP National Spokesperson Harrison Carter commented on behalf of the organisation saying: \\"Fees themselves are unfair and act as a barrier to education, widening the rich- poor divide which exists in this country. I and many other members of the UK Youth Parliament seriously condemn this action. The news that fees are set to go up, and that the graduate tax is to be dropped is truly worrying for young people.\\" \\"We are deeply concerned that young people under the age of 18, those whom increased fees will actually hit, haven‚Äôt been adequately consulted about the proposed changes to university funding.\\"http://harrymyp.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/response-to-the-review- of-higher-education-and-student-finance-in-england-october-2010.pdf The Government made the decision to increase University tuition fees to a maximum of ¬£9,000 with a view that higher education institutions should invest some of the extra income from fees above ¬£6,000 in promoting fair access.http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher- education/docs/g/11-1046-government-response-to-browne-review =Protests against the proposals= Students staged a number of demonstrations leading up to the Commons vote on 9 December 2010 On 10 November 2010 students staged the first in a series of marches to demonstrate against the proposed increase in the rise in tuition fees. The demonstrations in London received negative publicity after a group of protesters attacked the Conservative party headquarters. The National Union of Students, who had staged the protests, condemned the violence as \\"despicable\\" with union president Aaron Porter saying \\"this was not part of our plan\\". Protests continued on 24 November 2010 with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) organising a mass national walk out of education and protest. The police came under fire for the practice of \\"penning in\\" protesters for long periods with Simon Hardy, the spokesperson for NCAFC describing the tactics as \\"absolutely outrageous\\". On 30 November 2010 further protests were held in London with demonstrators congregating in Trafalgar Square as well as in other cities around the UK. The protests in London resulted in 153 arrests and with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts accusing the police of pre-emptively \\"blocking\\" the protest route and so keeping them in the square. The police replied that they never had \\"any intention to contain the protesters.\\" On 9 December 2010, the day of the House of Commons vote on whether to approve measures which could see the rise in tuition fees, further demonstrations were held in London. The protests, this time policed by 2800 officers, saw tensions running high and angry scenes as the debate on the proposals was discussed in the Commons. =House of Commons vote= On 9 December 2010, MPs approved raising the cap on tuition fees by a 323 to 302 vote. The result gave the Government a Commons majority of 21. The majority represented a substantial rebellion in the Government with the coalition's majority being cut by almost three- quarters and with 21 Liberal Democrat and 6 Conservative MPs actually voting against the government. A plurality of Lib Dem MPs (28 to 21) voted in favour of the Bill, including Nick Clegg, Vince Cable, Jo Swinson, Sarah Teather, Ed Davey, Danny Alexander and Steve Webb.See How Liberal Democrat MPs Vote Amongst those voting no were former Lib Dem leaders Sir Menzies Campbell and Charles Kennedy. Three junior ministerial aids acting as Parliamentary Private Secretaries also chose to defy the government with Liberal Democrat aids Michael Crockart, Jenny Willott voting no whilst Conservative Lee Scott chose to abstain. All three did so knowing that in order to defy the government whip they would also have to resign from the positions they held. Speaking on the governments victory Business Secretary Vince Cable said the coalition had been through a \\"difficult test\\" and added \\"I think the job now is to try and explain this policy to the country. It is nothing like as threatening to young people going to university as has been portrayed.\\" Universities Minister David Willetts said the proposals struck the \\"right balance\\" and said \\"The package is fair for students, fair for graduates and affordable for the nation\\". Speaking against the proposals during the debate MP Greg Mulholland however said that sometimes governments get things wrong and added \\"I am voting against the government today because I simply cannot accept that fees of up to ¬£9,000 are the fairest and most sustainable way of funding higher education.\\" Labour's shadow Business Secretary John Denham said that the fees increase had been driven by the government's decision to make deep cuts in university funding alleging that \\"Even if they had just cut universities the way they are cutting other public services, students would be facing fees of no more than ¬£4,000.\\" Peers in the House of Lords voted to approve the plans on 14 December 2010 by a clearer majority of 283 to 215. Speaking during the debate, the author of the report on which the government proposals were based, Lord Browne, said that he believed the reforms were \\"essential for this nation to maintain its hard-won pre-eminence in higher education\\". =Judicial review= In 2012, the High Court granted permission for a judicial review to be heard in regards to the increase in top up fees. However the challenge was not successful. Adjustments in the 2015 budget During the budget announcements of July 2015, George Osborne announced that tuition fees, which had been capped at ¬£9,000 since 2012, would rise with inflation from the 2017‚Äì2018 academic year onwards. He also announced that maintenance grants were to be scrapped from September 2016. The changes were not debated or voted on in the commons, instead being considered by the Third Delegated Legislation Committee in January 2016. The lack of a vote on the matter has drawn criticism, as by circumventing the commons the measures \\"automatically become law\\". The committee lacks the power to reject legislation independently.

The company was founded by the brothers John, Thomas and William Loake in 1880, in an outbuilding at Thomas Loake's house at 62 King Street, Kettering. Northamptonshire is the centre of the English shoemaking industry. In 1894, the Loake brothers built a new factory and moved to Wood Street, where it can still be found today. The factory was initially named the Unique Boot Factory. It has a floor area of approximately 20,000 sq ft, accommodates over 300 workers. It was considered one of the finest and most advanced shoe factories in the country, at the time. The factory is split into three parts - bottom stock (soles), the making room, where the shoes are finished, and a warehouse. Loake specialises in men's traditionally crafted handmade Goodyear-welted shoes. Construction of some styles involves using 130 skilled workers, up to 75 shoe parts and over 200 different operations and can take 8 weeks to make from start to finish. During the First World War, Loake contributed to the war effort with the manufacture of Terrain boots, Convalescent boots and Despatch Riders boots for the British Army. Cossack boots were also made for the Russian army. Loake participated in the British Empire Exhibition, which was held at Wembley Park, Wembley, England from 23 April 1924 to 31 October 1925. It was hoped that the Exhibition would strengthen the bonds within the British Empire, stimulate trade and demonstrate British greatness both abroad and at home. During the Second World War, factories in Great Britain were required to allocate production space to the war effort. Loake produced footwear for both the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. At its peak, production was 2,500 pairs of boots per week. In 1997, due to the decline of British manufacturing, market conditions and in-line with other British shoemakers, Loake made the decision to move about two-thirds of its closing operation - the stitching of its uppers - to India. Loake is involved in a joint venture with a privately owned Indian company, whose factory is located near Chennai. Loake have held a Royal Warrant since 2007, for providing men's footwear to Her Majesty the Queen. In 2011, Loake opened their first standalone retail store in Jermyn Street, London. In 2015, The Independent wrote of \\"the brand‚Äôs durable, comfortable but stylish footwear\\".

The Archbishop of Palermo was Jean Carondelet (:nl:Jan II Carondelet) a Burgundian cleric, politician, jurist and one of the most important advisors to the Habsburg rulers, Philip I and his son Charles V. Such connections ensured his rapid advancement in the church hierarchy and the award of rich benefices such as the Archbishopric was simply a financial perquisite. Fortunately, Carondelet published the text of the letter in a pamphlet which was widely circulated and reprinted several times.The latest edition known is dated 1565 The image of the letter shows it beginning with a forthright condemnation of the nonsense (geographorum hallucinatio) of Ptolemy and other early geographers and by implication it contradicted Aristotle's view of the world‚Äîand to disbelieve Aristotle's views, which were at the centre of religious orthodoxy, was officially heresy.The Louvain university statutes formally declared that contradiction of Aristotle was heresy which would be punished , p47 Monachus had his own views of geography which were based on investigation, observation and observation rather than Aristotelian dicta., p54 Such beliefs exposed Monachus to suspicion. The hemispheres shown in the pamphlet are presumed to be rough sketches printed with two small woodcuts about in diameter. The actual globe was certainly larger and finer in every respect since the reply to Monachus contains the following statement: Orbis globum, in quo terrae ac maria luculenter depicta sunt, una cum epistola accepimus‚ÄîWe accept the globe of the world on which the land and sea are elegantly depicted, together with the epistle. pp96‚Äì98 As noted by Jan Denuc√©, we probably have a fairly faithful image of the lost globe in Oronce Fine's map of 1531, who adopted the views of Monachus.Jan Denuce, ‚ÄòEenige onzer minder bekende kartografen uit het begin der XVIe eeuw [Quelques-uns de nos cartographes peu connus du d√©but du xvie si√®cle/Some of Our Less Well-Known Cartographers from the Beginning of the XVI Century]', Handelingen van het eerste Taal- en Geschiedkundig Congres gehouden te Antwerpen den 17-18-19 September 1910, (Antwerpen, [1910]), pp.258-267, p.260. The content of the map is discussed in great detail by Stevenson and Harrisse and a summary of their findings by Siebold is readily available online. The most important features as follows. :*North America is no longer an island as shown in the Waldseemuller map made about 20 years previously. Instead it is shown as an extension of mainland Asia. However, Monachus did accept Waldseemuller's concept of separate North and South Americas although he reduces the separation to a channel (coincidentally close to the modern Panama Canal) which he admits (in the epistle) might be dubious even if wished for as providing easy access to the Moluccas (Spice Islands). This was one of the first maps to deny the existence of a Pacific ocean extending into the northern hemisphere. :*The Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Florida peninsula and all of South America are remarkably accurate. Many later maps would lack this fidelity. :*The existence of a Southern continent is confidently asserted on the hemispheres shown in the pamphlet, which bear the inscription in Latin which translates:\\"This part of the coastline that has been revealed to us by voyages is not yet evident\\".HEC PARS ORE IS NOBIS NAVIGATIONIBUS DETECTA NONDUM EXISTIT: Robert J. King, ‚ÄúFranciscus Monachus' Southern Continent, in his own words‚Äù, The Globe, no.81, 2017, pp.101-104 . A paragraph in the text explains: > To the south, land has been found in two places south of America toward the > South Pole, stretching in longitude 43 degrees westward, to latitude south > sometimes to 54, sometimes 53, sometimes 55 degrees as the topography > reveals.

Carondelet was the principal advisor of Charles at a time when Spain and Portugal were again debating the division of the world into two hemispheres. The 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas (and its amendments) had agreed a demarcation line that divided the Atlantic and cut through South America. Everything to the east, from Brazil to India, was Portuguese; everything to the west was Spanish. Twenty or so years later the discovery of the riches of the Moluccas (Spice Islands), at a time when the mineral wealth of South America was untapped, gave rise to a great debate as to who should possess those Islands. In 1528, Monachus presented Carondelet a geographical globe which implied that the anti-meridian of the Tordesillas dividing line would clearly put the Moluccas in the Spanish hemisphere. In his accompanying tract, De Orbis Situ, he said: \\"Maximilian Transylvanus recently published a letter concerning the Moluccas islands, which exist in the sea called variously the Mar del Sur, or of the Sinae, or of Syn [China Sea], finally revealed to the men of our age excellently, and clearly all in the portion and dominion of the King of Spain, except for Java and Porne or Borneo, of which a part toward the west is subject to the King of Portugal, the part which faces the east being subject to the King of Spain\\".Maximilianus Transylvanus meminit ex epistola, quam de Moluccensibus insulis aedidit, quae in mari tum Sur, tum Syni, tum Syn, aliter atque aliter dicto extant, praeclarae san√® et nostri saeculi hominibus demum patefactae, ditionis omnes, et portionis regis Hispaniae praeter Iavam et Pornen seu Borneu, quarum pars in occasum vergens, regi Lusitaniae, pars spectans in Orientem Hispaniae regi subdita est. It is therefore no surprise that Carondolet published as widely as he could.Jerry Brotton ‚ÄúTerrestrial Globalism: Mapping the Globe in Early Modern Europe‚Äù, in . One year later the Treaty of Zaragoza was concluded whereby Spain lost the Moluccas despite the globe of Monachus.

History  The first source to mention the castle of Ocre is a Papal bull of Pope Alexander III in 1178 in which it is mentioned among the possessions of the diocese of Forcona. In 1254 it was mentioned with the name of \\"Cassari Castro\\" between those saved from destruction during the founding of the town of L'Aquila. in 1266, the reign of Charles I of Naples, the castle was ravaged by troops from L'Aquila after the reconstruction of the city previously destroyed by Manfred, King of Sicily with the support of the barons of the castle. Charles of Anjou confiscated the castles close to L'Aquila as a result of their support to Conradin, and in 1269 the castle of Ocre was given to Morel de Saours. In 1283 the castle was assigned to Giovanni di Bissone and in 1293 suffered another plunder by troops from L'Aquila. The most destructive attack, however, was launched in 1423 by the condottiero Braccio da Montone. Lost the role of defending the city of L'Aquila, the castle will start a gradual decline: at the beginning of the 16th century Ocre is no longer mentioned as \\"castrum\\" but as a \\"villa\\", with the population gradually abandoning the fortified village.  Architecture  The castle is actually more properly classified as \\"fortified village\\". The walls, in fact, include old houses, a tower houses and streets. The plan is an isosceles triangle, with a perimeter of 470 m, the base (which is also the shortest side) to the northwest and the apex of the triangle to the southeast. The walls includes seven towers. The only entrance to the castle is located at the corner tower on the west side and consists of an arched door dated back to the 13th century and protected by a defense system. In the southern part of the village there is a church, dedicated to the Holy Saviour \\"inter castrum Ocre\\". Built on a nave and two aisles with an apse at the end and known since 1581, it is completely ruined now. From this church come the remains of a fresco of the mid 12th Century, depicting the Madonna and Child, today at the National Museum of Abruzzo.

To the east of the road is the original 19th century cemetery and to the west of the road lies the 20th century addition. Today, it caters for all faiths with separate burial grounds and chapels for Jews and Catholics and a growing one for Muslims together with two military cemeteries. The 19th century cemetery is designed with an informal garden cemetery layout with winding paths while the remainder is a more formal grid type which was favoured by cemetery designer John Claudius Loudon. Much of the original cemetery is a County Wildlife Site and contains grassland and a wide selection of mature trees. History In the 19th century a link had been established between the overflowing city churchyards and the outbreak of diseases. As a result of a cholera epidemic in the city in 1848‚Äì49, the Mayor of Norwich received an order from the Home Secretary that all burials must cease in the city's churchyards from 1 February 1855. A number of possible sites were considered but eventually former farmland in Earlham was acquired and purchased with a loan of ¬£5000 from Gurney's Bank. Edward E Benest, the city surveyor, designed the cemetery to cater for all faiths with consecrated sections for Church of England burials and unconsecrated for non-conformist burials together with a separate burial ground and mortuary chapel for Jews. Included in his original plans were lodges, offices, twin Gothic chapels and the planting of trees and shrubs. In 1874 a further were added to the north- east of the site and a Roman Catholic chapel was built. A piece of land was reserved in this new section for the burial of soldiers from the city's Britannia Barracks. Money was raised by public subscription to raise a monument in their memory. A statue designed by John Bell and made by Doultons and named The Spirit of the Army ‚Äì Armed Science was unveiled by Lord Waveney in 1878.

Both earthquakes had epicentres in the eastern Mediterranean between Rhodes and the coastal city of Fethiye in Muƒüla Province, southwestern Turkey. Tectonics As noted by a scientist from Istanbul Technical University, the tectonics of the Aegean Region of Turkey, which incorporates many faults, produces earthquakes frequently. The quakes can reach magnitudes up to 7.2 with aftershocks of 5.1. A geological fault in the southern part of the region stretches from the Greek island of Rhodes northeastwards to Burdur and passes close to the vicinity to Fethiye. Earthquake characteristics The first earthquake hit at 21:17 hours local time on April 24, 1957 and lasted 25 seconds having a magnitude of 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale; a stronger second quake occurred at 04:26 hours on April 25; this one lasted for 60 seconds and had a magnitude of 7.3. The earthquakes also shook many locations around Fethye, the epicenter, including Isparta, Burdur, Tefenni, Acƒ±payam, Denizli, Nazilli, Aydƒ±n, Yataƒüan, Milas, Bodrum, √ñdemi≈ü, Muƒüla, Marmaris, K√∂yceƒüiz, Ka≈ü and Finike as well as the Greek islands of Kos, Symi and Rhodes. Damage and casualties Around 1,500 structures, including public buildings such as schools, hospital, prison, gendarmerie station, community health center and city hall, were damaged. The number of affected people was around 8,000. A section of the harbor quay broke away and sank into the sea, and asphalt road surfaces split and cracked. The earthquake ruined almost the entire city, with 90% of buildings being damaged. Thanks to the strict evacuation order of the district governor Nazif Oku≈ü after the first quake, the number of dead remained at only 19 for the city and the villages around with a total population of around 60,000. According to another source, a total of 67 people were killed, 27 in the city and in its villages, 40 in the surrounding districts. Telecommunications were interrupted as the telephone lines broke, but communications were restored two days later by the use of field telephones. Aftermath The first actual relief came on April 26 from the Turkish Red Crescent () with 2,500 blankets, 1,350 tents and a field hospital. President Celal Bayar, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and high government officials visited the disaster region on April 28. Wreck removal works were hampered by uninterrupted rainfall. On April 29, the destroyer , a warship of the British Mediterranean Fleet delivered 2,000 blankets, 500 tents, medicine and food to the earthquake victims in Fethiye.

It is prepared using the liquid collected from steamed clams. Clam juice is used as an ingredient in various dishes, as a beverage that is drunk in its whole form, and as an ingredient in various beverages. Preparation Clam juice is typically prepared from the liquid obtained from steamed clams. Clam juice may be prepared fresh or obtained in prepared bottled form. Some companies mass- produce prepared clam juice, which is made by steaming fresh clams in water with salt, collecting the extracted liquid known as clam extract or clam liquor, and then filtering it. In 1937, William G. Frazier invented a clam opener devised to easily open clams and retain all of the clam juice, which was collected in a bowl. A patent for the clam opener was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on November 15, 1938. Use in dishes Bottled clam juice being used in the preparation of clam chowder Clam juice is sometimes used in the preparation of clam chowder and other chowders. It may be used as an ingredient in various sauces and meat sauces, seafood dishes, in soup bases, and as a condiment to top foods, similar to the manner that fish sauce may be used. Italian chefs sometimes use clam juice as an ingredient in seafood dishes and pasta sauces. It is sometimes used during the deglazing process in cooking. It may provide a mineral-like flavor to dishes, and serve as a substrate to assist in combining flavors present in a dish. As a beverage Some restaurants and bars in the US serve shots of pure clam juice. For example, the Old Clam House in San Francisco, California serves a shot glass of hot clam juice at the beginning of each meal. In the early 1900s in the United States, clam juice was purported to be a hangover remedy. Exterior of the Everleigh Club, circa 1911 The Everleigh Club, a former brothel in Chicago, Illinois, that was in operation from 1900 to October 1911, would serve iced clam juice and a tablet of aspirin as a starter for breakfast, which began at 2:00 in the afternoon. Beverages with clam juice=Soda fountains= In the United States in the early 1900s, clam juice was used as an ingredient for various beverages at soda fountains. Beverages prepared with clam juice included hot clam juice, hot clam soda, hot ginger clam broth, hot celery punch, hot clam cream, clam night cap, tomato clam broth and others. During this time, a recipe for hot clam juice used one-half to one-ounce of clam juice in an eight-ounce glass, the remainder of which was filled with hot water. Accompaniments included soda crackers, celery salt, salt and pepper. The beverage was sometimes prepared with the addition of milk or hot milk. The addition of a small portion of butter would enhance the flavor of hot clam juice. =Cocktails= In contemporary times, clam juice is sometimes used as an ingredient or drink mixer in cocktails, such as the Caesar, also known as a Bloody Caesar. =Clamato= Bloody Caesar cocktail prepared with Clamato juice Clamato is a mass-produced beverage prepared with tomato juice concentrate, clam juice and spices. It also contains high fructose corn syrup, monosodium glutamate, salt and ascorbic acid. Clamato is used as an ingredient in the Caesar cocktail.

The couple divorced In 1980. She has three children (Heather Titus, Carina Driscoll, and David Driscollhttps://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/carina-driscoll-says-shell-run- for-burlington-mayor-her-way/Content?oid=11038297) from her marriage with Driscoll, who were later adopted by Sanders. O'Meara finished her college degree at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont, with a bachelor's in social work. She met Bernie Sanders in 1981, ten days before his first campaign victory as Mayor of Burlington, and again at his victory party; the couple married in 1988. In 1996, she earned a doctorate in leadership studies in politics and education from Union Institute & University headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Sanders is Roman Catholic. She does not regularly attend Mass, but sometimes visits Saint Anne's Shrine when facing problems. Career Early in her career Sanders worked in the Juvenile Division of the Burlington Police Department, and then as a community organizer with the King Street Area Youth Center, and as a volunteer for AmeriCorps VISTA. From 1981 to 1991, Sanders served as founding Director of the Mayor's Youth Office and Department Head in the City of Burlington. She was also active in K-12 education, elected as a School Board Commissioner, and was a founding member of the Women's Council & the Film Commission.

In 1996, Sanders was appointed as Provost and Interim President of her alma mater, Goddard College, to help the college through a difficult period. The Board, faculty, staff, students and Sanders worked together to improve the accreditation, finances and governance of the institution.Burlington Free Press; August 31, 1996, Just Jane: Activist Roots Pull Sanders Home to Goddard College\\" From 2004 through 2011, Sanders was President of Burlington College, a small liberal arts college founded in 1972 for non-traditional students. It closed due to financial problems in 2016. As senior partner in the Burlington-based consulting firm, Leadership Strategies, O'Meara worked as a political and educational consultant for federal, state, and local political campaigns. Sanders was instrumental in founding The Sanders Institute, a progressive think tank which launched in June 2017, and is one of its 11 original fellows. Like the other fellows, she does not receive payment for her work, although she does receive compensation for travel expenses. =Adviser and aide to Bernie Sanders= Bernie Sanders has described his wife as \\"one of [his] key advisers\\", and he has employed her at various times as \\"an administrative assistant, spokeswoman, policy adviser, chief of staff, and media buyer\\". In a 1996 article in The Washington Post, she was credited with helping him draft \\"more than 50 pieces of legislation\\". She has served in Sanders's Congressional office as Chief of Staff and as Policy and Press Adviser, and also serves as an Alternate Commissioner for the Texas Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission. =Burlington College presidency= In 2004, Sanders was named President of Burlington College, a private, non-profit liberal arts school founded in 1972 in Vermont. She increased the small college's fundraising. During her tenure as President, Burlington had an endowment of \\"about $150,000\\", and fundraising revenue had increased from about $25,000 when Sanders first arrived to $1.25 million by 2011. In 2010, Sanders oversaw the purchase of property formerly owned and occupied by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington. The College based the real estate purchase on projections that enrollment would rapidly grow from fewer than 200 to as many as 750 students, with a corresponding income increase from tuition fees. In 2011, the College's Board of Trustees, while crediting Sanders with acquiring a permanent campus for the 200‚Äëstudent college, called a meeting for September 2011 and accepted Sanders's resignation. \\"We reached a decision which I believe is best for both the College and me,\\" Sanders said after the meeting, \\"The board and I have different visions for the future and that's perfectly fine.\\" On departure, she received the title of President Emeritus and a $200,000 severance, consisting of one year's pay, along with certain retirement and bonus payments. With the College unable to collect on some promised pledges after Sanders had resigned, and the enrollment increase plans failing, the Diocese settled the loan debt with the College in 2015 for $996,000, less than the agreed amount, and with $1 million of the repayment made in shares of an unidentified LLC company.

It is characterized by three forms: a stripped neoclassicism (typified by the designs of Albert Speer); a vernacular style that drew inspiration from traditional rural architecture, especially alpine; and a utilitarian style followed for major infrastructure projects and industrial or military complexes. Nazi ideology took a pluralist attitude to architecture; however, Adolf Hitler himself believed that form follows function and wrote against \\"stupid imitations of the past\\".Nazi architecture, in \\"Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture\\", 2006, p. 518. While similar to Classicism, the official Nazi style is distinguished by the impression it leaves on viewers. Architectural style was used by the Nazis to deliver and enforce their ideology. Formal elements like flat roofs, horizontal extension, uniformity, and the lack of decor created \\"an impression of simplicity, uniformity, monumentality, solidity and eternity,\\" which is how the Nazi Party wanted to appear. The construction of new buildings served other purposes beyond reaffirming Nazi ideology. In Flossenb√ºrg and elsewhere, the SS built forced-labor camps where prisoners of the Third Reich were made to mine stone and make bricks, much of which went directly to Albert Speer for use in his rebuilding of Berlin and other projects in Germany. These new buildings were also built by forced-laborers. Working conditions were harsh, and many laborers died. This process of mining and construction allowed Nazis to fulfill political and economic goals simultaneously while creating buildings that fulfilled ideological expression goals. The crowning achievement of this movement was to be Welthauptstadt Germania, the projected renewal of the German capital Berlin following the Nazis' presumed victory of World War II. Speer, who oversaw the project, produced most of the plans for the new city. Only a small portion of the \\"World Capital\\" was ever built between 1937 and 1943. The plan's core features included the creation of a great neoclassical city based on an East-West axis with the Berlin victory column at its centre. Major Nazi buildings like the Reichstag or the Gro√üe Halle (never built) would adjoin wide boulevards. A great number of historic buildings in the city were demolished in the planned construction zones. However, with defeat of the Third Reich, the work was never started.

The decision by the ECB to go ahead and create what is now known as AnaCredit was made in February 2014. The purpose is to support: * monetary policy analysis and operations; * risk management; * financial stability surveillance. Seat of the European Central Bank and Frankfurt Skyline at dawn 20150422 1 AnaCredit focuses on the collection of granular credit data to address the main data needs of the ESCB. While some of the data could be also helpful for prudential supervision, AnaCredit is not set up to meet banking supervisory needs and no specific requirements pertaining to the ECB‚Äôs Banking Supervision (Single Supervisory Mechanism) are included in the Regulation. Eurozone states are obliged to participate, while Member states of the European Union outside the eurozone can voluntarily participate. Two of the Scandinavian countries: Denmark and Sweden have announced their intention to do so. The project was initiated in 2011 and data collection is scheduled to start in September 2018. The final regulation was decided by the ECB's Governing Council on 18 May 2016.  The reporting population  The following entities are subject to the reporting requirements: * Credit institutions resident in a euro area Member State; * Branches of credit institutions, provided that the branches are resident in a euro area Member State. = Derogations = The relevant national central bank may grant derogations to small reporting agents in accordance with national criteria. Derogations may be granted by the relevant national central bank provided that the total commitment amount for all derogations in the country concerned does not exceed 2% of the total commitment. For instance, it is possible that in those Member States in which credits are extended by a large number of relatively small credit institutions the derogations may lead to a large number of small credit institutions being exempted.  Reported credits  Only credits extended to legal entities and other entities that are not natural persons fall under the scope of the data collection. Loans and deposits are the only instruments that will be considered, with credit derivatives and off-balance-sheet items being excluded from the scope of the regulation. Loans and deposits include * deposits other than reverse repurchase agreements; * overdrafts; * credit card debt; * revolving credit other than overdrafts and credit card debt; * credit lines other than revolving credit; * reverse repurchase agreements; * trade receivables; * financial leases; * other loans.  Reporting threshold  A given instrument has to be reported if it is held by a debtor whose total commitment amount for all relevant instruments equals or exceeds ‚Ç¨25,000 at the reporting reference date. In such cases, every single credit instrument of the debtor is subject to reporting, even if the commitment amount of an individual instrument does not exceed the threshold.  Reporting frequency  The frequency of reporting is monthly or quarterly dependent on data set.  First reporting  The first reporting to AnaCredit relates to data for 30 September 2018 and covers both data reported monthly and data reported quarterly.

His father, Emil Ziehl, founded ZIEHL-ABEGG, a company which was later led and rebuilt by G√ºnther Ziehl. Childhood G√ºnther Ziehl was born in Berlin-Wei√üensee. His father‚Äôs company had been in business for three years by then,The Electro-locomotives of the Berharnd Station and Emil Ziehl used to take his son with him to work. This woke G√ºnther Ziehl's early interest for technology and motors. Start at ZIEHL-ABEGG After successfully passing the German Abitur, G√ºnther Ziehl started his Engineering studies at the Technical University of Berlin in 1934. As his father laid on his deathbed in 1939, he gave G√ºnther Ziehl full power of attorney and control over the company. At that time, G√ºnther Ziehl was preparing to take his final university exams. Emil Ziehl‚Äôs will was for his son to inherit the company, so at the age of 25 G√ºnther Ziehl became the owner and leader of ZIEHL-ABEGG. The young student was now responsible for over 1000 employees.Where It All Started on www.ziehl-abegg.com A few weeks after his father‚Äòs funeral, G√ºnther Ziehl took his final exams and graduated as an Engineer. He then focused his time and energy to the family business and pushed the further development of ZIEHL-ABEGG. The production in Berlin got so big, that most of the German lift Motors were supplied by ZIEHL-ABEGG in the early 1940s. End of WWII and restart of the company The war left the facilities in Berlin fairly untouched. The Soviet Administration expropriated the company after war‚Äôs end and demanded G√ºnther Ziehl to dismantle the facilities and to load them in railroad cars. Everything was to be sent to Russia. G√ºnther Ziehl himself was in danger to be deported, in order to accompany the transport and re start the production line there. G√ºnther Ziehl saw no other possibility for his family and for himself than to secretly flee. The company was dismantled and the Berlin Villa confiscated. In order to feed his family, G√ºnther Ziehl started to work as a transport worker in F√ºssen. At night he would talk to local farmers, and convinced them to let him repair their electrical devices. He would take food as payment. Due to his open manners and his ability with electronic motors, his clientele grew rapidly. This led to the registration of an official electronical business in 1947. The reliability of ZIEHL-ABEGG as a motor manufacturer and supplier was still remembered by many customers. One of them, Stahl Aufzugstechnik, sought to renew contact with the Ziehl family. The swabian business had been removed from Stuttgart to K√ºnzelsau, in order to protect it from allied bombings. There, they still needed an expert in all things electronics and started searching for the known partner.The Blue Wonder Continues on www.ziehl- abegg.com The fact that G√ºnther Ziehl was the sole manager and director of ZIEHL-ABEGG until end of the WWII made the restart of the company easier and swifter. The name and the patents could be used again. G√ºnther Ziehl also took plenty of construction documents and drawings with him as he fled. This proved to be a very wise idea. From 1949 on, K√ºnzelsau‚Äôs ZIEHL-ABEGG grew to become once again a respected company and a reliable supplier. Heinz Ziehl was brought to the company after his war‚Äôs imprisonment and together with his brother G√ºnther, they further led the company. Social engagement In K√ºnzelsau, G√ºnther Ziehl dedicated himself to the matters and issues of elderly people. He was one of the drivers behind the ‚ÄúHouse of Encounter‚Äù, a meeting place for senior citizens. He donated a building of his property for this end. He organized visits every year to the different nursing homes in the district, to which he brought small presents, together with the Hohenloher Wine Queen. The ‚ÄúHouse of Encounter‚Äù received praise nationwide, as it was the first institution of the kind. G√ºnther Ziehl‚Äôs engagement did not end in K√ºnzelsau, for he was involved across country in several organizations for the elderly. He actively participated in many of these organizations. For his commitment he received the Federal Order of Merit. On 20 July 2002, G√ºnther Ziehl died at his home in K√ºnzelsau.

He was particularly renowned for his wearable art designs. Early life Born Christopher Louis Nemeth in Birmingham, Nemeth studied painting at the Camberwell College of Arts, London, between 1979 and 1982, when he graduated. Among his paintings were works using glue, sand and printing on deconstructed old clothing used as a canvas. He subsequently decided to start making clothing for himself, as he could not find garments to suit his tastes. Fashion At first, Nemeth hand- sewed his designs from discarded materials, including his own paintings. He was particularly known for his use of linen mail bags found discarded on the streets of London, but also used rope and charity shop clothing to assemble his pieces. He then began selling his work through the Kensington Market, London. His clothing was mainly androgynous menswear, although he produced some designs specifically for women. In 1985, Nemeth met the photographer Mark Lebon, who showcased his designs in a shoot for i-D magazine. This led to Nemeth's designs being retailed in the Mayfair boutique Bazaar. At the same time, Lebon introduced Nemeth to the jewellery and accessories designer and stylist Judy Blame, who had co-founded The House of Beauty and Culture with the shoe designer John Moore. Soon afterwards, Nemeth met his future wife, Keiko, the first person to sell his work in Japan, at a John Galliano fashion show. In June 1986 he decided to relocate to Tokyo to be with Keiko, where he sold his clothing through the Sector boutique in Harajuku. Sector also retailed Blame's work and the early work of Galliano. In 1993, Nemeth took over Sector, renaming it after himself, and opened branches in Osaka, Fukuoka and Nagoya. He continued to use recycled fabrics, combining discarded offcuts and remnants from tailoring shops into patchwork yardage to use for his designs. Although Nemeth achieved popularity and a cult following in Japan, as a result of his move, his reputation back in Britain has remained low-profile. His name is better known among fashion insiders than among the general public, with his higher-profile admirers including designers Martin Margiela and Rei Kawakubo. Kawakubo, who is said to have been inspired by Nemeth's deconstructive approach, sold his work through her Dover Street Market in London. In 2015, Kim Jones presented a menswear collection for Louis Vuitton inspired by Nemeth, and celebrating his life and work. The collection incorporated Nemeth's own prints, and jewellery designed by Blame. Jones, who is a renowned collector of 1980s London clubwear design, described Nemeth as \\"the most important designer to come out of London alongside Vivienne Westwood. He is Savile Row, he is the street, he is the club.\\" Death Nemeth died on 22 September 2010 from lung cancer. Nemeth's daughters, Lui and Riyo Nemeth, have launched a venue for young designers and artists in London called Primitive, designed to carry on their father's legacy.

Grill, in √ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950, vol. 10, Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1991, p. 102, http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl?frames=yes In his lifetime best known for his literary essays and reviews, he is the author of Asylum, a vivid account of his experiences as a Jewish refugee in France during the Second World War, first discovered and published more than sixty- five years after his death.Moriz Scheyer, Asylum, Profile Books, 2016, vii- viii; 274-7  Biography  Moriz Scheyer was born in Foc»ôani in Romania on 27 December 1886, the son of Wilhelm Scheyer, a businessman, and Josefine (n√©e Krasnopolsky). By the time of his secondary education the family had moved to Vienna, where they lived in the pleasant suburb of Hietzing.His childhood and school career are recalled in 'Encounter with my Own Youth' ('Begegnung mit der eigenen Jugend'), in Moriz Scheyer, Genius and Its Life on Earth (Erdentage des Genies, Herbert Reichner Verlag, 1938), pp. 153-65. After high school (Gymnasium), where he excelled in humanities and languages,Genius and Its Life on Earth, pp. 157-8. Scheyer studied at the University of Vienna, from which he graduated with a law degree in 1911.Degree certificate 'Doctor Juris', University of Vienna, November 1911. He began his career as a writer with short pieces for newspapers, joining the staff of the Neues Wiener Tagblatt (NWT; one of Vienna's two 'quality' dailies) in 1914.Moriz Scheyer, Asylum, p. 12 A committed 'good European' and devotee of the internationalist and pacifist Romain Rolland,Moriz Scheyer, Europeans and Exotics (Europ√§er und Exoten, Strache, 1919), p. 12; Asylum, pp. 279-80; 285; 288. he expressed his horror at the atrocities of the First World War;Poem by Scheyer, 'Lonely Battlefield' ('Einsames Schlachtfeld'), in Arbeiterzeitung, 17 November 1914: 'Under the pale first snow / Many a sorrow lies buried. // The late moon, indifferent and cold, / Shines down like a funeral torch. // The night utters prayers for the dead. / In the east there glimmers a distant light.' a chronic health condition may in any case have exempted him from active service.M. Grill in √ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950 (n. 1 above) describes Scheyer as 'unfit for military service' ('kriegsdienstuntauglich') and as a committed opponent of the War ('√ºberzeugter Kriegsgegner'). He also wrote bitterly of the devastating aftermath of the conflict, the Great Depression, in Austria.Moriz Scheyer, Escape to Yesterday (Flucht ins Gestern, Georg M√ºller, Berlin 1927), pp. 10-11, quoted in Asylum, p. 288: 'They have disappeared without trace ... those ... bright Palaces of the Grail that were pointed out to us by cunning deceivers on the Horizon of Peace ... Dynasties were overthrown; oppressors put aside; but in their place came a thousand other dynasties, a thousand other oppressors ...' He travelled extensively - making a sea voyage via Egypt to South America before 1919 ‚Äì and these travels inspired much of his early writing.Europeans and Exotics, Tralosmontes, Amalthea-Verlag, 1921 and Cry from the Tropical Night (Schrei aus der Tropennacht, Georg M√ºller, Munich, 1926). A lover of French culture and literature, Scheyer had lived in Paris in the period before 1924, as a cultural correspondent for the NWT, and continued to visit regularly after his return to Vienna.Asylum, p. 12 He also seems to have spent some time as a correspondent in Switzerland.'Campione', Neues Wiener Tagblatt, 25 April 1919, written from Lugano, with the byline 'von unserem Schweizer Sonderberichterstatter' ('by our special Swiss reporter'). From 1924, in Vienna, until his dismissal at the Anschluss, Scheyer was arts editor of the Neues Wiener Tagblatt.After 1938, and its ‚ÄòAryanization‚Äô by the Nazis, the NWT was amalgamated with other titles; it appeared for the last time in 1945 He was in charge of the review section (‚ÄòTheater und Kunst‚Äô) and thus held a position of significant cultural influence. Acquainted with many of Vienna's prominent literary and musical figures, such as Arthur Schnitzler,Moriz Scheyer, 'Arthur Schnitzler', in Escape to Yesterday, pp. 170-6 Joseph RothAsylum, p. 286 and Bruno Walter, he was a personal friend of Stefan Zweig,Asylum, pp. 107; 260-2; 285-6. Zweig mentions Scheyer in letters to the French author Georges Duhamel in 1922 and 1923: Duhamel, Correspondance: l'anthologie publi√©e de Leipzig, Leipziger Universit√§tsverlag, 2001, pp. 114, 124; F. Zweig, Stefan Zweig, p. 205, lists Scheyer amongst friends visiting the author at Salzburg. with whom his work has some strong affinities (see 2.4 below). In October 1927 he married Margarethe Schwarzwald (n√©e Singer), the daughter of a successful Czech-Jewish industrialist and widow of Dr Bernhard Schwarzwald, and through the marriage acquired two adoptive sons, Stefan and Konrad (after emigration to UK: Stephen Sherwood and Konrad Singer). With the advent of the National Socialist regime in Austria in March 1938 (the Anschluss), Scheyer, at the height of his career, lost his position on the NWT, as well as any possibility of further employment in Austria. He escaped via Switzerland to Paris, accompanied by his wife and their long-term housekeeper and companion, Sl√°va Kol√°≈ôov√°. This experience, as well as that of life in Paris both immediately before and after German occupation, the flight south in the 'Exodus', a period of incarceration in the French camp of Beaune- la-Rolande, life in the 'free zone', a series of extraordinarily narrow escapes from deportation to a death camp, and a final rescue by the Rispals,Gabriel Rispal (1875-1970), H√©l√®ne Rispal (1903-79) and Jacques Rispal (1923-86), who became a successful stage and film actor. On the Rispal family and Resistance in Belv√®s, see Georges Rebi√®re, Aimez-vous cueillir les noisettes: message personnel', PLB √©ditions, 2012 and Asylum, pp. 265-72. a family involved in the Resistance, followed by life in hiding in a Franciscan Convent in the Dordogne, are recounted in vivid detail in Asylum. Scheyer remained in France (through the generosity of the Rispals) for the rest of his life, without returning to Austria. He had suffered from a chronic heart condition even before the traumatic experiences of 1938-44, and died in 1949. It seems that he made some effort to have his autobiographical work published, but ultimately despaired of finding anyone interested in what had happened 'only' to Jews.Asylum, pp. vii-viii; 2; 244; 274-7.  Work  Until the posthumous discovery and publication of the autobiographical work Asylum, Moriz Scheyer's main literary output consisted of travel writing, book and theatre reviews (in particular for the Josefst√§dter Theatre) and, especially, essays in the distinctively European genre of the feuilleton - pieces inspired by a particular event, e.g. a book publication or exhibition, but going beyond mere review in their personal reflection or historical analysis. His first three published books are travel writings; the remaining three published in his lifetime are collections of feuilletons, previously published in the NWT. His autobiographical 'survivor's account', Asylum, was discovered by his step grandson P. N. Singer many years after his death, and first published in English translation in 2016.  Travel writing  Scheyer's early books Europeans and Exotics, Tralosmontes and Cry from the Tropical Night are inspired by his travels, especially in the near East and in South America. Largely factual (although Tralosmontes seems more in the style of a novella), they consist of vivid depictions or vignettes, and are preoccupied with the 'exotic', in terms of both place and character. Examples are Saadi ibn Tarbush, a young Egyptian boy who acts as Scheyer‚Äôs guide in Cairo, but is seduced by the glamour of the European‚Äôs life; Mr Dronnink, a Dutch musical genius ruined by a woman and by drink, ‚Äòburnt out‚Äô and reduced to playing the piano on cruise ships; and Gly Cangalho, a morphine-addicted ‚ÄòCreole‚Äô character who spends her life travelling on cruises, known to all the captains. There are also parodic Englishmen - themselves exotic in their ability to be at home everywhere and lack any emotional response to the exotic around them. Vivid pictures are painted of the experience of a tropical night on the ship; of storms, of cockfights, of the ‚Äòcoffee coast‚Äô; Scheyer creates an eerie, exotic world, both through his character portraits and through his evocation of atmosphere and place.P. N. Singer, 'Moriz Scheyer: Writer', in Moriz Scheyer, Asylum, pp. 282-4  Literary and historical essays  Scheyer's remaining books of the 1920s and 1930s - Escape to Yesterday, Human Beings Fulfil Their Destiny and Genius and its Life on Earth - are essentially collections of feuilletons; they focus especially on the lives and works of great men or women, especially great artists, of the past, from Balzac to Verlaine, from Mata Hari to Wilde. Although mainly focussed on historical figures and their artistic work, these essays share with the previous writings the atmosphere of nostalgia and the concern with vivid evocation of personality and place.  Asylum  Scheyer's account of persecution by and rescue from the Nazis, Asylum, is utterly different from his previous writing in genre and purpose. As he claims at the outset, 'it has nothing to do with literature';Asylum, p. 1. a work raw with emotion, it is concerned to recount the lived experience of the persecution, the 'mental misery' and 'broken souls'Asylum, pp. 2-3. suffered by Jewish people under the Hitler regime. Nonetheless, it brings the same critical and evocative skills that Scheyer used in his professional life to bear upon these traumatic experiences. One may also - with terrible irony - draw a connection between Scheyer's earlier literary work and that lived reality. In the book published just before his exile, Genius and its Life on Earth, he suggests that men fulfil their destiny or achieve greatness through suffering (examples are Tolstoy, Verlaine, Wilde),Genius and its Life on Earth: 'Verlaine', pp. 90-100; 'Leo Tolstoi', pp. 101-13 and 'Oscar Wilde', pp. 114-22. while Scheyer's own later experience of persecution led to the writing of what is undoubtedly his most significant work. Moroeover, his interest in women in history who sacrifice themselves for the men in their lives (Lady Hamilton, Anna Grigoryevna Dostoyevskaya, Sofia Andreevna Tolstaya)Human Beings Fulfil Their Destiny: 'Sophia Andrejewna', pp. 137-50; Escape to Yesterday: 'Anna Grigorjewna', pp. 74-83, 'Die Hamilton', pp. 200-11. finds a real-life echo in the immense debt that he owed to his wife Margarethe and companion Sl√°va, as well as to the self-sacrifice of the sisters of the Convent at Labarde - which he describes in moving detail.Asylum, pp. 164-9.  Style and literary milieu  Scheyer's reviews and essays show a strong engagement with contemporary Viennese writers, such as Hofmannsthal, Roth and Schnitzler. His own literary work, both in its emotive, evocative style and in its characteristic preoccupations, belongs distinctively within the Viennese literary milieu of the early twentieth century,P. N. Singer, 'Moriz Scheyer: Writer', in Moriz Scheyer, Asylum, pp. 282-92. and in particular shares much with his better-known friend and almost exact contemporary, Stefan Zweig (1881-1942). Three tendencies, especially, seem to link Scheyer's writing both with that milieu and with Zweig in particular: nostalgia, an obsession with 'great men', and a reverence for music. A preoccupation with a vanishing, irrecoverable world runs through the work of many of the best-known writers of Vienna in the early twentieth century, e.g. Joseph Roth,Joseph Roth, The Radetzky March (Radetzkymarsch, 1932), trans. Michael Hofmann, Granta Publications, 2002; The Emperor's Tomb (Die Kapuzinergruft, 1938), trans. John Hoare, Hogarth, 1984; for Scheyer on Roth see Asylum, p. 286. Arthur Schnitzler, and especially Zweig. In the short story Buchmendel, Zweig laments the passing of the old-world literary caf√© society of Vienna;Stefan Zweig, Buchmendel,1929, English trans. in Selected Stories, trans. Anthea Bell, Eden Paul and Cedar Paul, Pushkin Press, 2009. in Chess, the result of the chess game is symbolic of the defeat of the old, gentlemanly order;Chess (Schachnovelle, 1943), trans. Anthea Bell, Penguin Books, 2006. and his last work, The World of Yesterday, nostalgically recalls the world of his parents' generation.The World of Yesterday (Die Welt von Gestern, 1943), trans. Anthea Bell, Pushkin Press, 2011 Scheyer, explicitly responding to Schnitzler, writes of Vienna as 'The reflection of a city that has since lost its own I'. Schnitzler‚Äôs Vienna ‚Äì that world of tradition and culture, of clear social orders and customs, of elegant love-affairs ‚Äì is gone; it is a ‚Äòdisappearing dream, the resonance of a memory. Perhaps it will soon be no more than a barren word, an abstract concept without reference.‚ÄôEscape to Yesterday, p. 176, quoted in Asylum, p. 286. Already in his first published book, Scheyer writes ‚Äò... I have sought, again and again, to take refuge from the desolate reality of the last years in the only truth that still makes existence tolerable, opening wounds but at the same time healing them: memory.‚ÄôEuropeans and Exotics, p. 5. Nostalgia is the explicit theme of Scheyer's 1927 volume, Escape to Yesterday.'Yesterday ... it seems so many years since there still was a yesterday. It has become something so distant, so improbable, that ‚Äì even if you have actually experienced it ‚Äì you think of this yesterday as of a lost dream. ... It is spring now; then it will be summer, autumn, winter; and then spring again. But all of that is seems distant and devoid of light; none of it has the capacity to touch you any more. The time of expectations is past. Beyond the realm of hope, of fulfilment, of beauty and excitement, we watch unmoved as a present which is at once harsh and ghostly passes us by ‚Äì a present which is nothing but discontented noise and emptiness ... between yesterday and today everyone has become a stranger to himself: more troublesome than even a dead man for the living ...', Escape to Yesterday, pp. 9-11. Both quotations belong to specific historical contexts, the former looking back over the War years, the latter over those of the Depression. With still greater poignancy, Scheyer in Asylum talks of the lost innocence of the world of 1944, and of the past as seeming more real than the present.Asylum, pp. 208-9, 216. The fascination with the 'great man' (and sometimes woman) of history is another preoccupation central to Scheyer's work, again one shared with Zweig. Zweig's most substantial published books are studies of historical figures: of Balzac, Dickens and Dostoevsky; of Casanova, Stendhal and Tolstoy; of Romain Rolland.Romain Rolland: The Man and his Work, 1921; Casanova, Stendhal, Tolstoy: Adepts in Self-Portraiture, 1928; Three Masters: Balzac, Dickens, Dostoevsky, 1930. Each of the above individuals was also the subject of a feuilleton by Scheyer - probably directly inspired by the previous Zweig publication. Scheyer's last two books consist largely of essays dramatizing the life-stories of such 'greats'; to the above names are added amongst others those of Baudelaire, Victor Hugo, Rembrandt, Verlaine and Wilde. Music plays a pivotal role in Scheyer's world-view, in a way which is impossible to understand outside the culture of early-twentieth-century Vienna.P. N. Singer, 'Moriz Scheyer: Writer', in Asylum, pp. 290-1. Practitioners of classical music - especially the opera - enjoyed enormous popular and intellectual esteem; the composer and conductor were godlike figures, their realm of endeavour lifting them far above normal mortals.Again, Zweig exemplifies this most strongly: he was an avid collector of autograph manuscripts of the great composers, and kept a piano that had belonged to Beethoven in his study Scheyer, though not himself a music critic, had a pass to attend dress rehearsals at the Opera; and his rediscovery of music while in hiding, via the radio, is one of the most vivid emotional experiences in Asylum.Asylum, pp. 179-82. Nowhere is his nostalgia more real than in the evocation of the vanished faces of Mahler - 'the noble, illuminated face - the devotee at the altar of genius' - and of a previous generation of performers at the Vienna Opera.Asylum, pp. 180-1. Music has the capacity to take him back, but also to take him outside normal reality. Music also recurs (in a way which can again be paralleled in Zweig) as a metaphor in his writing: the sound of Nazi boots provides ‚Äòthe new theme tune of Parisian life‚Äô;Asylum, p. 58 and in the camp at Beaune there is the ‚Äònightly symphony of misery and sorrow, with the rustling of straw running through it like a pedal note on the organ.‚ÄôAsylum, p. 95.  Discovery and publication of posthumous work  The manuscript of Scheyer's dramatic survivor's account, Asylum (original German title 'Ein √úberlebender'), thought to have been destroyed, was discovered fortuitously by the sons of Scheyer's stepson Konrad Singer in the process of the latter's house move in the 2000s.Asylum, pp. vii- viii; 274-7. The text was translated, and published with notes and epilogue based on his further research, by P. N. Singer, Scheyer's step-grandson, in January 2016. It is published in the UK by Profile Books, with a US edition (Little, Brown), as well as German, French, Italian and Spanish editions. P. N.

Its main building, a handsome Romanesque structure, stands at the eastern end of the Milford Dam. Built in 1906, it was at that time the largest hydroelectric facility in the state, and its construction marked a shift from water to electrical power of area industries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description The Bodwell Water Power Company Plant stands at the eastern end of Milford Dam, although it is technically not a part of the dam; a log sluiceway and fish ladder separate the facilities. The dam and power plant are located at one of the major falls on that stretch of the river, and its largest single source of power. The plant is a monumental steel-framed structure faced in brick, measuring , and projecting over the river on a two- story concrete foundation. The base of foundation is an arcade of arches, with square windows above aligned with those of the structure resting on top. The main structure is roughly that of a basilica, with a tall central section flanked by lower side sections, with clerestory windows at the sides of the central section. The interior has original tile floors, iron railings, and other features, including a traveling industrial crane that can be used to maneuver heavy equipment throughout the building. History The site where the power plant stands was the location of a large sawmill in the 1880s and 1890s. Joseph Robinson Bodwell was a major owner of the Milford Land Company, which owned that mill, and it was under the aegis of that company that the power plant and dam were built in 1905-07. The reasons for the architectural sophistication, especially for a comparatively remote site, of the main plant are not known, but follow a trend for high-style architecture in large public buildings during that period. It was designed by Wallace C. Johnson, a civil and mechanical engineer who had worked on hydroelectric projects in Niagara, New York. The plant was originally designed to produce 12,000 horsepower, and the power was mainly sold to industrial customers in nearby communities. (The mill standing across the river in Old Town was not one of these customers‚Äîit had its own internal power plant.) In 1998 Bangor Hydro, then the owner of the plant, sold it (along with its other hydroelectric power generation assets) to PP&L; Global of Fairfax, Virginia. It is now owned by Black Bear Hydro Partners LLC, and has an authorized capacity of 8 megawatts.

She studied at the New York School of Art, and then went abroad to study in Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid with Robert Henri. She exhibited work in the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1912. In the United States, she exhibited at the National Academy of Design , the 1910 Exhibition of Independent Artists, the 1913 New York Armory Show, and the 1915 Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture by Women Artists for the Benefit of the Woman Suffrage Campaign, among others, contributing to the introduction of European Modernism to the United States. Education Louise Josephine Pope, of New York City, attended Wellesley College from 1890‚Äì1894, graduating with her B.A. She went on to study at the New York School of Art, where Robert Henri was teaching. On June 15, 1907, Louise Pope and Kathleen McEnery led the list of awards for the school with Portrait class scholarships; Louise Pope received a Composition scholarship as well. Career Pope reportedly moved to Paris with her mother, Josephine B. Pope, to study art, but exactly when is unclear. She may have traveled back and forth frequently between New York and Europe. In the 1908 American Art Annual, she is listed as living at 74 South Washington Square, New York. In the 1913 catalog, she is listed at 50 Washington Square, New York. She attended Robert Henri's summer school in Madrid, Spain in 1906, as well as his summer school in Haarlem and Amsterdam in 1907. She was mentioned frequently in letters by Robert Henri and John Sloan, and apparently was considered a possible second wife for Robert Henri, whose first wife had died in 1905, and who remarried in 1908. She exhibited her work at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1912. She also exhibited repeatedly in the United States. At the Winter exhibition of the National Academy of Design in 1906, she showed a Street Scene and a Park Scene. She was included in the 1910 Exhibition of Independent Artists. In the 1913 New York Armory Show, she displayed an oil painting, Portrait of Mrs. P. She exhibited in two group shows at the MacDowell Club in 1913, one in one in March‚ÄìApril, and one in October‚ÄìNovember. In the October show she included four nude studies. She also exhibited in the 1915 Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture by Women Artists for the Benefit of the Woman Suffrage Campaign. Stylistically, she explored the early modern painting styles of Futurism and Cubism. Not uncommonly for painters in the new styles, her work was heavily criticized. A review of a group show at the MacDowell Club in 1913 sniped: 'Louise Pope, who went to Paris, where she now is, a few years ago, a sane and healthy painter, has felt the lure of the \\"Futurists,\\" and has not yet recovered. She shows four nude studies, presumably females.' At the Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture by Women Artists for the Benefit of the Woman Suffrage Campaign in 1915, her work was identified as \\"Cubist\\" and described as \\"incoherent and quite barbarous\\" and as depicting \\"prophecies of subway explosions.\\" Marriage Louise J. Pope was married to Henri Hourtal (1877‚Äì1944) of Paris, on December 30, 1916, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. Hourtal, also a painter, was attached to the French army in Morocco and was later recognized for his paintings of Algeria. Louise J. Pope has been incorrectly identified as the wife of Dr. Robert Ticehurst, but Dr. Ticehurst's obituary clearly identifies his wife as \\"Alice Louise Pope, R.N. (1914‚Äì2004)\\", born after the 1913 Armory Show. It is also easy to confuse Louise Josephine Pope with another Louise Pope who graduated from Wellesley College in 1892, later marrying Homer Johnson to become Louise Pope Johnson.

Labor feminists advocated for protectionist legislation and special benefits for women. They helped pass state laws regulating working conditions for women, expanded women's participation in unions, and organized to oppose the Equal Rights Amendment. 1920s to 1970s  After gaining the right to vote, the National Woman's Party proposed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA was bitterly opposed by the social feminists who saw it as undermining many of the gains they had made in the treatment of women workers. The charge was led by labor feminists, who were the successors to Progressive Era social feminists. Labor feminists did not want to end all distinctions based on sex, only those that hurt women. For example, they felt that state laws that put in place wage floors and hour ceilings benefited women. Thus, they continued to advocate for protectionist legislation and special benefits for women. In addition to state wage laws, they sought to expand maternity leave, health coverage during childbirth, and disability and unemployment coverage for mothers. Their view was that women had different needs than men and should not be penalized for performing the function of motherhood. By the 1940s, labor feminists began to broaden their advocacy efforts at the national level. Led by prominent labor figures such as Esther Peterson, an AFL‚ÄìCIO lobbyist, and Myra Wolfgang, a trade union leader, labor feminists came together at the Women's Bureau at the U.S. Department of Labor to advance their social reform agenda. This included equal pay for comparable work, shorter workdays for women and men, and social welfare support for childbearing and childrearing. In 1945, they introduced the Equal Pay Act in Congress, which sought to abolish wage disparity based on sex. Their version of the bill, which was different than what passed in 1963, advocated for equal pay for comparable work in addition to same work because employers often undervalued the contributions of women in roles that women tended to occupy. Labor feminists re-introduced the bill every year until 1963 when the Equal Pay Act was passed. During this time, labor feminists also expanded women's participation in unions. They viewed union organization as an effective way to pressure employers to close the gender wage gap. In 1947, they helped orchestrate the largest walkout of women in U.S. history when 230,000 telephone operators nationwide went on strike against AT&T;, cutting off telephone service at the White House. The merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955 created a unified labor movement with greater political and economic power. The AFL‚ÄìCIO adopted the CIO position on equal pay, and by the late 1950s, federal equal pay legislation became a priority of the merged organization. In 1960, President Kennedy appointed Peterson the Director of the Women's Bureau, and she became the highest-ranking woman in President Kennedy's administration. In her new position, Peterson helped draft a report for the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW). The PCSW had been established by President Kennedy in 1961 to examine the gains of women and role of government in addressing the changing needs of women and their families. Their report American Women published in 1963 expressed a desire for the elimination of gender difference, but not where it would remove protections for working-class women.  Legal debate over the ERA  Labor feminists supported the Hayden Rider to the ERA, which said that the ERA could not impair any existing benefits conferred to women. Many labor feminists, including Peterson, believed that legislation could promote equality and special benefits for women and did not see these as incompatible. These feminists located women's rights within a framework of women's service as workers and homemakers, rather than the framework of liberal individualism used by equal rights feminists. Legal scholars challenged the idea of a legally viable model of promoting equal rights that did not erode those protections already in place for women. First, they argued that this would be problematic from an application standpoint. Legislation that afforded privileges to women that were not available to men would be valid, but disabilities imposed on women because of their sex would be invalidated. Deciding when a statute conferred a benefit rather than a disability would be difficult. Second, they argued it was problematic from a sociological standpoint. Legal constructions of difference reinforced cultural stereotypes and limited the definition of the role of women. While there were valid biological differences between men and women, it was thought that these definitions invoked generalities and ignored the capabilities of the individual.  Decline in labor feminism  The labor movement remained a powerful presence throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. The passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963 without the desired comparable pay language represented a significant defeat for labor feminists and shifted the terms of the debate with equal rights feminists. ERA supporters had opposed the language out of a desire for true equality. Labor feminists remained united in their opposition that the ERA would erase protectionist legislation, but split in their approach as it became apparent that they would not be able to achieve expansions of equality without sacrificing some protections. The passage of Title VII in 1963 further undermined their position. Protectionist legislation violated Title VII's prohibitions against discrimination based on sex. The rapidly changing economic and cultural landscape of the 1960s contributed to the successes of equal rights feminists over labor feminists. One of the biggest opponents of comparable pay language had been American businesses. In the aftermath of World War II, American businesses flourished, and the power of the American business lobby grew. US business leaders opposed government support for people not in the labor force and government intervention in the labor force. As the federal government retreated from the private sector, it left the task of caring for workers to employers. In the backdrop of the Cold War, American politicians and the public interpreted this economic success as validation of American ideals of individualism and free enterprise, which provided further justification for the emerging corporate welfare state and opposition toward socialist measures. By the 1970s, there was a decline in labor feminism. Some labor feminists hoped that the movement could regroup around an agenda of equal rights and equal opportunity. A group of labor women helped secure support for the ERA from the United Auto Workers, the American Federation of Teachers, the Newspaper Guild, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Women's Bureau switched its position on the ERA in 1970. In 1971, Peterson also changed her mind, reasoning that history was moving in this direction. However, some labor feminists, including Wolfgang, remained staunchly opposed and testified against the ERA in Congress. The passage of the ERA in 1972 enabled equal rights feminism to solidify its place as the dominant women's movement in the US.

They restored the right of appeal to the people and introduced measures which were favourable to the plebeians. The consuls' actions came after a plebeian rebellion, the second plebeian secession, which overthrew the second decemvirate, which had ruled tyrannically. The two consuls had shown sympathy towards the plebeians and, as a result, had been chosen to negotiate the resolution of the rebellion. Their new laws quelled the plebeian unrest.  Background  In 454 BC, during what was to be the 200-year Conflict of the Orders between the patricians and the plebeians, the patricians gave ‚Äúconsent to the appointment of a body of legislators, chosen in equal numbers from plebeians and patricians to enact what would be useful to both orders and secure equal liberty for each.‚Äù Livy, The History of Rome, 3.31.7 The plebeians wanted a published set of laws so that there were clear and known rules and protections as well as punishments. Up until that time, the laws were unwritten and open to arbitrary use and, at times, abuse. A ten- man commission was appointed to develop the laws, the Decemviri Legibus Scribundis Consulari Imperio (decemviri means ten men). The consulship (the office of the two annually elected heads of the republic) and the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) were suspended. The decemviri were also to act as a government exempt from the right to appeal to the people against arbitrary actions on their part. The conduct of the first decemvirate was exemplary and it drew up ten bronze tablets of laws. It was felt that two more laws were needed to complete the legislation. A new decemvirate was elected. According to Livy, the second decemvirate was despotic and abused the people, taking advantage of their exemption from the right to appeal. This eventually led to the plebeian rebellion known as the second plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to Mons Sacer (Sacred Mount) outside the city and pledged to remain there until their demands were met. Their demands were the resignation of the decemviri, the restoration of the right to appeal to the people and the restoration of the plebeian tribunes and their powers. Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, two patricians who had stood up to one instance of abuse of a plebeian by the decemviri and had shown sympathy towards the plebeians, were sent to Mons Sacer negotiate. The negotiations were successful, the decemviri resigned and the secession was called off. Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius were elected as the consuls for the year. They restored the right to appeal to the people and passed measures which were favourable to the plebeians to address their grievances which had emerged during the rebellion.  The laws  Lex Valeria Horatia de plebiscitis. This established that the resolutions passed by the Plebeian Council were binding on all. The plebeians had created this body as their own assembly where they could debate their own issues during their first rebellion, the first plebeian secession (494 BC). The patricians were excluded from the Plebeian Council. The Council could also vote on laws which concerned the plebeians. It was convened and presided over by the plebeian tribunes, positions which had been created during the first plebeian rebellion. These tribunes proposed resolutions to the vote of the Council. These plebeian institutions were created for the self-defence of the plebeians against abuse by the consuls and the Roman aristocracy and were separate from the institutions of the patrician-controlled Roman senate. The patricians refused to recognise the Council's resolutions as laws binding on the whole people and therefore on the patricians as well. Livy wrote that as ‚Äúit was as it were a point in controversy, whether patricians were bound by regulations enacted in an assembly of the commons, they [the consuls] proposed a law in the assembly of the centuries [the Assembly of the Soldiers, which voted on laws proposed by the consuls], that whatever the commons ordered collectively, should bind the entire people; by which law a most keen-edged weapon was given to motions introduced by tribunes.\\"Livy, A History of Rome, 3.55.3-4 Lex Valeria Horatia de provocatione. This was restoration of the right of appeal to the people (provocatio ad populum), which means calling out to the people. A citizen could call out to the people against the summary use of power against him by the consuls or officials. With this type of appeal the summary action undertaken would be stopped. This law also forbade the creation of any official positions that were exempt from the people‚Äôs right of appeal. Livy stated that through this law the right of appeal to the people ‚Äúwas not only restored but strengthened for the future by a fresh enactment. This forbade the appointment of any magistrate from whom there was no right of appeal, and provided that anyone who did so appoint might be rightly and lawfully put to death, nor should the man who put him to death be held guilty of murder.‚Äù Livy, The History of Rome, 3.55.4-5 Lex Valeria Horatia de tribunicia potestate. This law restored the potestas tribunicia, the powers of the plebeian tribunes (often referred to as tribunician powers). It also put in place the principle of the inviolability (sacrosanctitas) of the plebeian tribunes, the aediles (the assistants of the tribunes) and the decemviri into law. This principle was based on the lex sacrata (sacred law), which was a religious sanction according to which a temple, sacred object or person could be declared physically inviolable (sacrosanct). According to Festus \\"Sacred laws are laws which have the sanction that anyone who broke them becomes accursed to one of the gods, together with his family and property\\".Festus, On the meaning of words, Epitome of Paul The violator became sacer (accursed), was considered as having harmed a god or the gods in addition to the sacrosanct object or person, became forfeit to the god(s), anyone who killed him/her was performing sacred duty and would not be punished and the dead violator was surrendered to the god(s) in question. The principle of the inviolability of the plebeian tribunes had been established following the first plebeian rebellion. Besides being the leaders of the plebeians, the plebeian tribunes were the protectors of the plebeians. They had the power to stop actions by the consuls or officials which they deemed as summary and harmful to individual plebeians. This power rested on the principle that the person of the plebeian tribune was sacrosanct. Anyone who hurt him would be declared sacer. In effect this meant that the plebeians swore to kill whoever hurt their tribunes and this was given a religious basis.Cornell, T.J., The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 259-260 The plebeians undertook to protect their protectors. Livy said that the consuls renewed the potestas tribunicia ‚Äúwith certain sacred rites revived from a distant past, and in addition to securing their inviolability by the sanctions of religion, they enacted a law that whoever offered violence to the magistrates of the plebs, whether tribunes, aediles [the assistants of the tribunes], or decemviral judges, his person should be devoted to Jupiter, his possessions sold and the proceeds assigned to the temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera ‚Ä¶‚Äù.Livy, The History of Rome, 3.55.6-8  Views of modern historians  In both the case of the law on the right of appeal and that on the plebiscites, there were three instances of such law. There were two other laws on appeal which were proposed by two consuls who were also members of the Valeria family, one by Publius Valerius Publicola in 509 BC and one by Marcus Valerius Corvus in 300 BC. Two other laws which provided for the plebiscites to be binding on the whole people were also proposed, one by Quintus Publilius Philo in 339 BC and one by Quintus Hortensius in 287 BC. This has led some historians to argue that in both cases the first and second laws are unhistorical and that only the third one is historical.Beloch, Romische Geschichte bis zum Beginn der punischen Kriege, 1896, p. 326Drummond A., Cambridge Ancient History2 VII.2 1989, pp. 113-142Forsythe, G., A Critical History of Early Rome, pp. 223-324Pais, E. Storia crtica di Roma, II (1913), p. 465De Sanctis, G., Storia dei Romani, II (1960), pp. 49-50Staveley, E. S, Historia (1955), p. 412-14Ogilvie, R.M., A Commentary on Livy, (1965) p. 252 Cornell disputes the above view. He points out that Roman legislators repeatedly dealt with the same subject and incorporated the provisions of the existing law into the amendments or the new provisions of a new law. He argues that it cannot be proved that the three laws on appeal were identical, that the purpose of the Valerio-Horatian Law was ‚Äúnot to grant the right of appeal per se [in fact, it was a restoration], but to prohibit the creation of magistracies not subject to appeal,‚Äù and that we do not know anything about the content of the law of 300 BC. He notes that Livy said that Marcus Valerius Corvus‚Äô law of appeal had was ‚Äòmore carefully set down‚Äô and that this must be in comparison with previous laws on appeal.Cornell,T. J., The Beginnings of Rome, p. 277 Livy also wrote ‚Äúthis was the third time since the expulsion of the kings that such a law had been introduced, by the same family in every instance‚Äù He specified that the second and third laws were renewals and said that he thought that the reason for this was that the wealth of a few carried more power than the liberty of the plebs. He added that the law forbade the scourging or execution of those who appealed, but merely provided that if anyone should disregard [its] injunctions it should be deemed a wicked act.Livy, The History of Rome, 10.9.3-6 Regarding the law on plebiscites constituting laws binding the whole people, Cornell, again, thinks that the record of three subsequent laws on the same subject need not imply that the first two were unhistorical. He notes that between 449 BC (the year of the Lex Valeria-Horatia) and 287 BC (the year of the Lex Hortensia) there were thirty-five plebiscites which had the force of law. He argues that the law of 449 BC probably established the general principle, ‚Äúbut in some way restricted its freedom to do so, for instance, by making the plebiscites subject to the auctoritas partum or to the subsequent vote of the comitia populi, or indeed both.‚Äù Auctoritas patrum meant authority of the fathers (the patricians) through the patrician-controlled senate.The meaning of this term is uncertain. Cornell rules our that it meant veto of laws and thinks that it meant confirmation that the law did not contain religious flaws. Cornell, T.J., p 341 This would explain the difficulties in getting proposals passed into law, such as the various failed attempts at agrarian reform to help the poor, which must have had the support of the poor plebeians and the Plebeian Council. The law of 339 BC might have partially removed these restrictions and that of 287 BC probably abolished them altogether and, therefore these two laws were not repetitions, but re- enactments which introduced specific amendments which decreased patrician obstruction of the plebiscites. This could be possible as the sources do not provide the ‚Äòdetailed provisions of these laws.‚Äô Cornell,T.

Here his scholarly potential was identified, and for his secondary schooling he attended the local Gymnasium (school) where he passed his School final exam (Abitur) at the age of just 17¬Ω. His subsequent study of Evangelical Theology at Breslau was interrupted by military service in 1834/35, but he nevertheless completed his studies and received his degree in 1838/39. In 1843 he became a Protestant minister at Arnsdorf a short distance to the south of Strehlen, still in Lower Silesia. He would retain this incumbency until 1879 when poor health led to his reluctant retirement from it. In the meantime, in 1862 he received his doctorate from the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Wroc≈Çaw for a piece of work on Gregory of Nazianzus' Carmen LIV. In 1879 Schimmelpfennig relocated to Breslau where he was able to apply his scholarly proclivities to work as librarian for the Silesian Society for German Culture.

Their products are sold in branches of Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose, the Co-operative Food, Asda, Morrisons and Booths.  History  The village's renowned pies are a tradition dating back 220 years, usually baked to celebrate events and occasions of national importance. A total of ten commemorative pies have been baked, as part of the 9 festivals held since the year 1788. The first of these is thought to have marked the return to sanity of King George III, with the home of the first Denby Dale pie being the White Hart Inn. 200 years later, in 1988, another was baked to mark two centuries since the first. The BBC Radio One Roadshow broadcast live from the event, which served over 90,000 people and would see the village awarded a Guinness World Record for the world's biggest meat and potato pie. Pies have been baked in Denby Dale to celebrate Wellington's victory at Waterloo, as well as the 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, which would see lower bread prices. The original 1887 pie baked to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee spoiled, \\" the most famed incident in pie history is recorded for this, the fourth pie - once the pie appeared at Norman park, having been cooked at the White Hart by Halifax bakers led by a London chef, crowds swamped it. Yet as they dug into it, a rather unpleasant smell arose! - ‚Äúemitted such an intolerable stench that a number of persons were injured in the stampede to escape.‚Äù \\".( and was this the pie trampled underfoot ? ) A second was created a week later, known as the Resurrection Pie. 50 years later, another pie was created to mark the anniversary of the move. Ten years after the end of the First World War, a belated victory pie was created to raise funds for Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. In 1964, another was baked to celebrate the year's four royal births, though the event was marred by tragedy as four of the main organisers were killed in a car crash on returning from filming a program about the pie at the ITV Studios. In 2000, a special Millennium Pie was baked, serving over 22,000 people. The first slice was cut by well-known cricket umpire Dickie Bird. In time for the UK's National Pie Week 2012, Yorkshire laureate Ian McMillan wrote and performed a 'Piem' devoted to Denby Dale's creations. The Denby Dale Pie Company was sold to Chapel Foods Ltd. in 2013, and became part of Country Style Foods in 2015.  Television features  Denby Dale's pies have been featured several times on mainstream television. In 2011, the Hairy Bikers featured the village's most famous export in an episode of their series The Hairy Bikers' Mum Knows Best. The pie which marked the 1887 Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria was recreated, based on historical accounts of the recipe, in a 2012 episode of Channel 5's The Great Northern Cookbook ‚Äì weighing in at 1.5 tons. The pies were also featured in a September 2015 episode of the hit BBC One show The Great British Bake Off.  Awards and recognition  Denby Dale Pies was judged to produce the country's best meat and potato pie in a contest held by ITV's The Paul O'Grady Show in 2004, with the final of the competition held live on the teatime chat show. In 2012, the Denby Dale Chicken and Gravy Pie was awarded silver in the British Pie Awards. In July 2013, Princess Anne visited the company's flagship factory in Denby Dale. Two of the company's products were shortlisted for recognition in the 2015 FreeFrom Food Awards.

Foundation  The institute was established in January 2011 as ‚ÄúNational Center of Excellence‚Äù for application-oriented fundamental research in the area of batteries. Being part of the Helmholtz Association, it was jointly founded by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), University of Ulm, and two more associated partners, the DLR German Aerospace Center, Stuttgart, which is also member of the Helmholtz Association, and the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden- W√ºrttemberg (ZSW), Ulm. The Helmholtz Institute Ulm is supported by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The new institute building, which was inaugurated in October 2014, is located on the campus of University of Ulm and can accommodate about 120 employees.  Research  HIU picks up on fundamental issues related to electrochemical storage systems and, on this basis, develops entirely new materials and cell concepts. The objective of HIU is to develop sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices of the next and next-but-one generation i.e., storage systems that store more energy and are more efficient, lighter, more durable, safer, and less expensive than conventional systems. Batteries of that kind are an answer to the urgent demand for better storage systems for portable electric devices and electric vehicles and contribute, in addition, to solving the problem of fluctuating availability of renewable energy sources. To be able to achieve the above objectives, HIU gathers under its roof the expert knowledge of four leading research organizations. The skills of the partners involved cover almost all areas of battery research. KIT is considered to be leading in the development of altogether new storage concepts and the synthesis and analysis of the necessary storage materials and electrolytes. In addition, KIT has renowned expertise and uses the latest methods for the structural, chemical and electrochemical characterization of materials and cells as well as for overall system analyses. The groups from Ulm University focus on the investigation of electrochemical fundamentals and the modelling of elementary processes on electrode surfaces and inside materials. ZSW for decades has been successfully researching into battery material applications and, in close cooperation with the industry, develops new cells and tests the suitability for daily use of batteries. DLR is highly competent in the development and application of mathematical models and simulations of entire battery cells as well as in system development. HIU hence links excellent fundamental research with practical application. Together with Ulm University and KIT, HIU moreover expands teaching and promotion of young talents to train highly qualified young scientists in the strategically relevant field of battery research and industry.  Building  The HIU building In a 2015 competition, the new HIU building, which was planned by architects Nickl & Partner Architekten AG and was inaugurated in October 2014 after a two-year construction period, was awarded the Best 16 Architects Award in the category Educational Buildings. The 2,400-square-meter HIU building has three floors and a full cellar to accommodate 120 employees. The research building is divided into different types of usable space: The atrium is adjoined towards the inside by the chemistry and physics laboratories, and the offices are found on the outer sides. The ground floor accommodates additional special-purpose laboratories which are illuminated naturally either through roof light walls or upstream lighting panels. The architecturally characteristic fa√ßade of the building consists of punched-sheet elements whose differently sized punched holes create a pattern of optical interferences. The elements can be folded up in front of the office windows and can thus be used as sun protection and glare shields.

It is both charming and meaningful. In that Sabbagh‚Äôs film reminded me of a lesson I relearn every year at the Toronto International Film Festival: there are beautiful cinematic wonders to be found if you take the time to venture outside the buzzed-about Hollywood movies.\\" The Guardian critic Jordan Hoffman, gave it 3/5 stars.

The libretto was discovered in 20th century. The title refers to the bride's name (Stein) and to the special jewelry given to her by the electress as a wedding gift.

It offers an undergraduate 3 year full-time Diploma course in Fashion Design as well as short courses in Fashion Design, dressmaking, pattern drafting, garment construction, millinery, art and design on a full or part-time basis.  History  The Grafton Academy of Fashion Design was founded in 1938 by Pauline Elizabeth Keller Clotworthy. Born in 1912, Pauline was brought up in a large house in Glenageary, with several generations of family around her. Pauline showed a keen interest in sketching and writing and went on to study at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art (now the National College of Art and Design). It was there that one of Pauline's tutors, artist Se√°n Keating cautioned her on turning her life drawing into fashion illustrations, this only encouraged Pauline who then went on to study the art of representing fabrics and textures using watercolour in Browns Paris School of Fashion in London. Upon her return to Dublin, Pauline was advised by Arnotts department store manager Ronald Nesbit, to further educate herself on how to realise her fashion drawings. Pauline returned to London to train at the British institute of Dress Designing (Hardy Amies was a fellow student). Pauline, understanding that she had benefited from an education that was not available in Ireland, decided she wanted to share the skills she had acquired. Shortly after graduating in 1938, Pauline established the Grafton Academy, Ireland's first design school and within a year it had staged its debut show. Early graduates from the college include Neilli Mulcahy, Ib Jorgensen and Clodagh Phillips, all of whom made a significant contribution in promoting Irish fashion culture, both home and abroad. As of 2018, the Grafton Academy is managed by Pauline's daughter Suzanne Marr.

She worked as a commercial photographer for magazines and NGOs and completed assignments on refugees. Her work was exhibited widely and is held in the collection of Qatar Museum. Alaoui died from injuries suffered in a terrorist attack in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  Life and work  Alaoui was born in Paris to a Moroccan father and a French mother, and grew up in Marrakesh, Morocco. During her childhood and adolescence, she was regularly exposed to tragic stories of migrants drowning at sea while undertaking hazardous journeys, which she interpreted as stories of social injustice. When Alaoui turned 18, she moved to New York City to study photography at the City University of New York. Alaoui felt that studying in the United States allowed her to become \\"even more exposed to questions of belonging and identity construction.\\" She returned to Morocco in 2008. Alaoui believed that photography and art could be used for social activism, and should be used for \\"reflecting and questioning society\\". As a result, she chose to focus her work on social and national realities of cultural identity and diversity, migration and displacement. To do this, she used image creation, reports and studio video installations. One of her commonly used techniques was to set up a portable studio in a public place such as a market square and to invite interested passers-by to be photographed. Alaoui stated that her inspiration for this type of portrait photography came from Robert Frank's portrayal of Americans in the post-war era, such as in The Americans (1958). Alaoui often emphasizes her subjects, minimizing the background of some of her portraits. Art critics described her work as \\"post-Oriental\\", referring to the theory of Orientalism proposed by Edward Said. Her photos were published in The New York Times and Vogue. She also completed assignments for the Spanish TV reality show El Mago. In 2013, she was commissioned by the Danish Refugee Council to create a series of portraits of refugees in Lebanon. The project was called \\"Natreen\\" (\\"We Wait\\"). In 2013, she created a video installation entitled \\"Crossings\\", describing the journeys of Moroccans travelling to Europe. In 2015, she completed a photographic assignment \\"Everyday Heroes of Syria\\", in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, focusing on Syrians living in refugee settlements. The project was completed for the Danish Refugee Council, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office and ActionAid.  Death  Alaoui was hired by UN Women and Amnesty International to work on a photographic assignment on women's rights in Burkina Faso. On January 16, 2016, during her first week working on the assignment, she was seriously wounded by gunshots while sitting in a parked car with her driver outside the Cappuccino caf√© whilst gunmen attacked the Cappucino and the Splendid Hotel. Mahamadi Ou√©draogo, the driver, sustained critical injuries and died in the vehicle. Alaoui was quickly taken to a hospital and seemed initially in a stable condition following an operation. She died three days later of a heart attack. Her remains were flown to Morocco at the expense of King Mohammed VI of Morocco. On her death, the director of the Maison europ√©enne de la photographie and the president of Arab World Institute made a joint statement praising her work giving \\"a voice to the voiceless\\" and noting that she was \\"one of the most promising photographers of her generation.\\" Legacy The humanistic commitment displayed by Leila Alaoui throughout her life and work led after her passing to several tributes in Morocco, France and many other countries. The 6th Marrakech Biennale (February‚ÄìMay 2016) was dedicated to her memory, as well as the 2nd Photography Biennale of the contemporary Arab world in Paris (2017). Her family created the Leila Alaoui Foundation in March 2016 to preserve her work, defend her values and inspire and support artists working to promote human dignity.

Nowadays it is still run by volunteers as an infoshop and social centre in order to keep it an independent and non-profit harbour within Utrecht's nightlife.  History  The car centre ACU existed from 1935 to 1967. In 1976, the premises were squatted and adapted for habitation. Over time, multiple small businesses settled there as well, for example a bike-shop. The residents started a cinema in the former showroom in 1979. After two years the cinema was replaced by a coffeehouse to be able to provide a public space for the squatting community. Eventually this developed into a venue providing a stage for local and international bands since 1985. After almost being evicted the squatters realized the premises had to be bought. A foundation \\"stichting Voorstaete\\" was established to buy the property. In 1994 Stichting Voorstaete bought the ACU and the squatted premises around the corner, which now houses the hostel Strowis. After years of refurbishing the building, the ACU reopened in 1998, and was completed as the current venue in 1999.

Teochew porridge is served as a banquet of meats, fish egg, and vegetables that is eaten with plain rice porridge. It may be simply prepared plain (i.e. without toppings), or include sweet potatoes. The rice grains, while softened from cooking, are still whole and not in an overly starchy state. Because the porridge is served plain, it is suitable to accompany salty side dishes. The recipe originated in Chaozhou and was later modified by early immigrants prepared in Malaysia and Singapore over the generations to suit local tastes. In Singapore, Teochew-style porridge is usually consumed with a selection of Singaporean Chinese side dishes like nasi Padang. There is no fixed list of side dishes, but in Singapore, accompaniments typically include lor bak (braised pork), steamed fish, stir- fried water spinach (kangkong goreng), salted egg, fish cake, tofu, omelet, minced meat, braised tau kway, Hei Bee Hiang (fried chili shrimp paste), and vegetables. Teochew porridge dishes emphasize simplicity and originality, and every dish is cooked with minimum seasoning to retain its original taste. Teochew is famous for steamed fish, which is usually only seasoned with light sauce, spring onion, slices of ginger and a sprinkle of freshly crushed red pepper, so that the freshness and sweetness of the seafood can be fully appreciated.

The slogan of the station is We Love Music, and many internationally known DJs have a program on this station. The station broadcasts around different frequencies in Flanders at FM or DAB (in Flemish Brabant) and is located in Ghent in the Flemish Region of Belgium.  History  In mid 1981, four students from Ghent decided to launch an innovative radio concept. The new radio station aimed to focus on the age group from 15 to 35 years, and Flemish music was also forbidden. In February 1982 Ghent station launched under the name Radio One. Later, in 1987, a name change was implemented. Since then, the station sent out under the name of Radio SIS. In the frequency recognition round of 1990 Radio SIS was awarded a full frequency licence to broadcast every day on 102.8 MHz. The radio station identified by the further expansion a success in the region of Ghent. In 1994 signed a transmitter in Bruges and a transmitter from Kortrijk itself with Radio SIS From that moment under a new nickname Dansradio Vlaanderen aired in the three cities with a common programming. In 1996 the name was changed to TOPradio. Two years later in 1998, a partnership was entered into with the VMMa, the current Medialaan. The holding company of television channel VTM and then Channel Two took over the production and distribution of the TOPradio programs. For example, the radio programs of TOPradio (including Land van Hoogland with Peter Hoogland) were broadcast live on TV at Channel Two, but in May 2003 it came to a split with the VMMa. VMMa had plans to rebrand TOPradio into JIMfm a new station with the same name of the TV-channel JIM , a radio station with a wider music format. However, this station has been never launched. TOPradio got a restart with programs for Flanders from the studios in Ghent.

The only example was used for an uncompleted journey to Saigon. Design and development The D-40 was designed and built by Roger Dupuy, with the assistance of the Proven√ßal Aero Club, to be a robust aircraft fit for flights over large bodies of water and unfamiliar lands. It had a mostly wooden structure and was plywood covered. It was a monoplane with a thick section, three part wing. Its inner section was rectangular in plan, only occupying 20% of the span and without dihedral. The outer sections were trapezoidal out to briefly blunted tips and initially had 11.24¬∞ of dihedral. There were plans for further optimization of the dihedral angle during flight testing, though it is not known if it was changed. Ailerons occupied about 35% of the trailing edges. There were six span-wise members on both the tops and bottoms of the wings, the forward pair forming the rear of a ply covered leading edge box spar and the third and fourth pairs defining a second box spar around mid-wing. A layer of fabric, easily doped and smoothed was stretched over the ply skin, a technique widely used at the time. Each wing was braced from the upper fuselage longerons by V-struts rooted on the two wing spars at about 30% span. The fuselage of the D-40 was built around four longerons and divided into eight sections; the forward section was aluminium framed and covered as it housed the small diameter, nine cylinder Salmson 9AD radial engine. In photographs the engine was uncowled though early plans show a Townend ring-type cowling; it was mounted as high as possible to provide propeller clearance on rough landing sites. Behind it the underside fell away rapidly to maximum depth at the wing; overall it was deep, flat sided and bottomed, with rounded decking. The longerons were ash in the more highly stressed forward and tail sections, with spruce elsewhere. Its single seat, open cockpit was over the wing trailing edge, with a small windscreen and long, faired headrest. The D-40 had a triangular fin and trapezoidal rudder, the latter hinged forward of the one-piece, blunt tipped, rectangular tailplane and with the rectangular elevator hinged behind its trailing edge. Its fixed undercarriage had its main wheels mounted without axles, with a track of . On each side a V-strut, with the hub at its vertex, was hinged at about 45¬∞ to the vertical from the lower fuselage longerons. A vertical bungee strut acted as a shock absorber, placing the wheel below the joint between centre and outer wing panels. Its tailskid was of the steel leaf spring type. Operational history The exact date of the Dupuy D-40's first flight is not known but it was before the first week in January 1933. It received its certificat de navagbilit√© around the beginning of August 1933 after several modifications, particularly to the cockpit, had been made. Homologation trials, flown by Joseph Chartoire, were complete by early December. A year before, Ren√© Lef√®vre had flown from Paris to Saigon, departing on 18 December 1932 and taking only 10 days, 7 hours and 50 minutes in a Peyret-Mauboussin PM XI aircraft with a low power Salmson engine similar to that of the D-40. Chartoire had planned a repeat of that flight on its anniversary, though he left Paris on 14 January and, after travelling largely over French colonies or territories, arrived in Gab√®s where he damaged his hand in the propeller. He stayed at Damascus from 19 to 29 January to recover, then flew to Beruit. For uncertain reasons, he abandoned his flight and the D-40 to continue his travels but when he returned to Beirut the D-40 had been destroyed there. Only one D-40 was completed though Dupuy had hopes of marketing the aircraft. The cost, with a Salmson engine, was FF40,000; a lowered powered Anzani was offered as an alternative at FF28,000.

On the American side, the crossing is connected by Interstate 29 (I-29) and U.S. Route 81 in Pembina County, while the Canadian side is connected by Manitoba Highway 75 in the Municipality of Emerson ‚Äì Franklin. Over one million travelers are processed at this border crossing each year, making it the second busiest of such along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border west of the Great Lakes, behind only the Pacific Highway Border Crossing found between British Columbia and Washington state. The Pembina border station is the easternmost in North Dakota, located approximately west of the Red River of the North, the state's boundary with Minnesota. A separate border crossing between Emerson and nearby Noyes, Minnesota was in operation until 2006. The POE sits along an international trade corridor, making it an important commercial port. It is among the top five Canada-US crossings in terms of truck trade value, which was at (approx.) in 2011. Likewise, around 360,000 commercial trucks crossed at this location in that year, which grew to around 400,000 by 2013. This number is forecast to grow by about 58% by the year 2035.WSP/MMM Group Ltd. 2016. \\"Southern Red River Valley Review of Trade Route Network and Red River Crossings\\", final report (May). Government of Manitoba Transportation Systems Planning: https://www.gov.mb.ca/mit/transpolicy/tspd/pdf/rr_valley_transportation_study_final.pdf The Pembina and Emerson ports also manage the rail inspection stations next to the former Noyes‚ÄìEmerson East border crossing, where the BNSF Railway connects with the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway connects with the Soo Line Railroad, its U.S. subsidiary. History Original Emerson Customs facilities in West LynneIn 1871, the port of Emerson was established as the first land border customs station in Canada. It was created to protect and ultimately collect duty for trade with the Hudson's Bay Company trading post that was attacked in a Fenian Raid, and subsequently liberated by the U.S. Cavalry earlier that year. Though no longer active, the original customs building in Emerson still stands today. For many years, there were two roads entering Canada at Emerson: the popular Jefferson Highway (U.S. Route 75) entered from Noyes, Minnesota, and the Meridian Highway (U.S. Route 81) entered from Pembina, North Dakota. All Canada-bound traffic was directed to the brick customs building in downtown Emerson, which has since been converted into the Emerson Health Centre. In the mid-1950s, Canada built separate inspection stations at the border on both roads. The crossing across from Pembina was called \\"West Lynne\\"‚Äîthe name of the small village that had been absorbed by the Town of Emerson in 1883‚Äîwhile the larger crossing across from Noyes was known as \\"Emerson East.\\" The modern Pembina-West Lynne border crossing opened in 1964 while I-29 was under construction (the final section of I-29 from Joilette to the border was not completed until 1977). The facilities on the former U.S. Route 81 a short distance to the east were closed and subsequently demolished a few years later. Following the reconfiguration of PTH 75 and PTH 29 in 1985, most U.S.-bound traffic was diverted to the Pembina crossing. Also located near this crossing is Fort Dufferin, a former Canadian police post and base of the North American Boundary Commission, which surveyed and marked the international border as defined in the Treaty of 1818. During the 1870s, Fort Dufferin also served as a customs and immigration for steamboats entering Canada via the Red River. =Recent History= Emerson border station prior to expansion The Canadian and American governments closed the Emerson East and Noyes border stations in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and merged rail inspection operations with the ports at West Lynne and Pembina. The West Lynne border station was renamed Emerson following the closure of Emerson East in 2003. Both countries underwent an extensive expansion project, starting in 2017, providing significant upgrades to their facilities, as well as road infrastructure at the Pembina-Emerson Crossing. This was the first renovation project for the U.S. POE since 1996 and for the Canadian POE since 1999. Illegal immigration The number of persons crossing the border illegally into Canada (referred to as \\"irregular migrants\\") through the Emerson-Pembina-Noyes area has increased significantly following U.S. President Donald Trump's Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States executive order in January 2017. However, the port had begun to see a considerable increase of irregular migration as of early 2016, prior to the election of Trump. The increased levels of asylum seekers trying to enter Canada at the Pembina- Emerson and former Noyes-Emerson border crossings and other regions along the international border have garnered international media attention, resulting in the Canadian government renegotiating the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. government. The majority of recent irregular migration has been by migrants from African nations seeking asylum in Canada to avoid potential deportation from the U.S. Although persons claiming refugee status are not permitted to migrate to Canada from the U.S. (or vice versa) under the two countries' Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers who have crossed the border illegally in some cases have been allowed to stay in Canada while their applications are processed. The practice of crossing the border illegally is not without danger, especially during the cold prairie winter. On December 24, 2016, two Ghanaian men successfully made it across the border by walking several miles along the Red River in sub-zero temperatures. However, both suffered severe frostbite that required amputation of their fingers. In May 2017, a 57-year old Ghanaian asylum seeker died of hypothermia while attempting to cross into Canada via the closed Emerson-Noyes border crossing.

Most are ensiform (sword-like) but a few were falcate (sickle-shaped). They can grow up to long and between 3 cm wide. Although, the leaves at the stem base are smaller. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. They normally have 2 branches, the lowest branch is about long. The branches have one small, narrow stem leaf, around long. The upper branch has a slightly inflated spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are slightly violet stained or marked. The stems (and branches) hold between 1‚Äì2 terminal flowers, blooming between February and early March. The flowers come in shades of violet, or violet-purple. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. Some flowers are bi-toned, with the falls darker than standards. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which has not yet been described. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. In 1993, Colasante & Saur (in Linzer biol. Beitr. Vol.25, Issue2 on page 1189) stated that Iris setina could be regarded as an allopolyploid and theorise that it may have derived from other bearded dwarf species such as Iris pseudopumila Tineo and Iris pallida Lam. It also has a chromosome count of 2n=40, which is the same as Iris bicapitata, Iris relicta, Iris lutescens and Iris revoluta. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet setina refers to 'Setia', which is an old form of Sezze, a town in the region of Latium (which is now Lazio, one of the administrative regions of Italy). In 1958, Professor Ignazio Ricci (1922‚Äì1986), found the iris on Monte Trevi (near the town of Sezze) in Latium, south of Rome. He then reported and published the discovery in 'Annali Botanica' (Roma) Vol.26 (Issue 1) on pages 43‚Äì49, as being different to forms of Iris germanica L. Then on 15 February 1974, more specimens of the iris were found on the Monte Trevi and then sent to Maretta Colasante, who named the iris as Iris setina and then described and published it in Giornale Botanico Italiano (Giorn. Bot. Ital.) Vol.120 (1‚Äì2) Supplement 1 on page 112. on 30 September 1989. It was then published in Bulletin of the American Iris Society Vol.292 on pages 82‚Äì85 on January 1994. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and is listed on the Catalogue of Life, but has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List as of October 2015. Distribution and habitat It is native to Europe. =Range= It is found near the town of Sezze, within the region of Latina, in Italy. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C.

Certain elements are predictable, such as a waiting room with a receptionist and a separate room for ministry. If a location has additional space, they may have multiple rooms dedicated to ministry in order to service a larger number of visitors during a limited span of time. The hours of a Healing Room vary, but it is most common for a location to be open one or more days per week, with a two or more hour block of time, according to people involved in the ministry.  Organizational Structure  The International Association of Healing Rooms uses a mapping structure of Divisions, Nations, Regions, States or Provinces, Areas (within large states), and then individual Locations. The levels of Regions and Areas are optional, and are more common within the United States of America. Each office has at least one Director, with the possibility of having two Co- Directors, and optionally an additional person serving as an Associate Director.

The text is attached to the Shukla Yajurveda, and is one of the 20 Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads. History The composition date or author of Yajnavalkya Upanishad is not known, but the chapter 4 of the text is likely a late medieval era text since it references texts which were composed in 1st millennium CE and early 2nd millennium. Olivelle and Sprockhoff suggest it to be 14th- or 15th-century text. This text has been sometimes titled as Yajnavalkyopanishad in some manuscripts.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 526 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 97. Contents The Yajnavalkya Upanishad describes the state and expected behavior from a sannyasi as he leads the monastic life after renouncing all material and social ties. It is a short text, and notable for being identical in first three parts to the more ancient Sannyasa text and influential Jabala Upanishad. The later additions in the text are also notable for referencing and extensively quoting text from the early-2nd millennium CE Yoga Vasistha, as well some quotes from the Suta Samhita of Skanda Purana and the Pancadasi of 14th-century Vidyaranya. The first three of four chapters of the text are identical to chapters 4, 5 and 6 of the Jabala Upanishad. The last chapter of the text declares that the verses that follow are from other texts. The compiled verses describe the observed diversity of behaviors among those who have renounced. Renouncers, states the text, include those who have renounced in name only, are quarrelsome and are still attached to worldly things, in contrast to those who reside in their inner world, with self-knowledge and are kind. The fourth chapter is notable for socio-cultural topics from the renouncer's point of view. The successful Sannyasi, states the Upanishad for example, is one who sees \\"a portion of the Blessed Lord as soul in every living being\\", such as a dog, donkey, cow and outcast. However, it also includes sections for the ascetic monk giving him reasons to never desire women or children. Women, states the text, are like \\"a brilliant splendor of a pearl necklace\\" but are a source of sin, both lovely and cruel, they ensnare men into evil tendencies, and they get old, die and their bodies becomes food for other creatures. Women are chains of suffering and hold gems of sins, asserts the text. This characterization in this text, states Olivelle, is an attempt to create revulsion for a woman's body in the mind of an ascetic who has sworn to a celibate lifestyle, and similar characterization is also found in Buddhism and Jainism texts.Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, , pages 114, 178-181 with footnotes; For a comparison of monastic traditions and the ascetic views on women, see Karma Lekshe Tsomo (2004), Buddhist Women and Social Justice: Ideals, Challenges, and Achievements, State University of New York Press, , pages 55-67 The Yajnavalkya Upanishad, similarly, calls the desire for son as vain.Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, , pages 111-112 with footnotes He causes pain to his parents by miscarriage, in delivery, then through illnesses. The text depicts how boys tend to fall for mischief, go to Gurukul but may not learn, commit adultery and other sins in their youth, become penniless, grow old into sorrow and suffer the vicissitudes of life. This sentiment, states Patrick Olivelle, is similar to those found in the early Buddhist text Suttanipata, in a conversation between the god of death and evil named Mara and Buddha, wherein the latter states a father grieves on account of his sons. A renouncer, states Yajnavalkya Upanishad, has no desire for sons or married life, and goes past all these vicissitudes. He is detached. A mendicant's behavior may be perceived as madness by those caught up with cravings for the material world, but he is not. He sees his own body as a source of internal sorrow, just like he sees a prison or enemy as the source of external torture. In the closing verses, the Upanishad emphasizes that the sannyasi must seek to perfect his own inner nature, such as renunciation of anger. Translates Olivelle, the text questions, \\"if you are angry at the wrongdoer, why are you then not angry at anger itself?\\" One must abandon all anger, because it is against one's Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. Every time one is angry, one should introspectively pay homage to it, as it reveals one's inner faults, states Yajnavalkya Upanishad.

Seagrass bed sediment (soil) is typically anoxic, containing a reduced form of sulfur: hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S is a phytotoxin that results from anaerobic digestion, the decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. However, seagrass can persist in this environment because of physiological adaptations, as well as functional adaptations of other organisms in the ecosystem. For example, bivalves (clams) in the family Lucinidae host symbiotic bacteria that oxidize sulfides. Lucinid bivalves' gills house the bacteria, and the siphon supplies the bacteria and surrounding pore water with oxygenated water from above the sediment. Bacterial oxidation of the sulfides results in sulfates, reducing toxicity.

Tuan Mami's works are often based on site-specific and re-constructional concepts to deal with questions about art, life, meaning and social interactions between people. Constantly exploring new mediums and methods of expression, Tuan Mami is known for his daring, and increasingly meditative experimentations with installation, video, performance and conceptual art. Life Tuan Mami graduated from Hanoi Fine Art University in 2006. He was Visiting Faculty at San Francisco Art Institute in 2013. He founded MAC-Hanoi, a Mobile Art Center in 2012 and co-founded of Nha San Collective in 2013 - a group of young artists who dedicate ourselves to pushing boundaries for freedom of expression within the Vietnam context in relation to globalization. Work=Myth in East Mist (2015)= Myth in East Mist is a project based on research about the Vietnamese community in South Korea, where about 65,000 multicultural Vietnamese‚ÄìKorean families live. Most of the families consist of Vietnamese brides who have come to South Korea to marry a Korean man. Many brides bring their mothers from Vietnam to stay with them, most of which cannot speak Korean, have no friends, and remain isolated. This artwork is a way of remedying dismissed cultures, pressures from non-stop journeying to find a better life, and of filling the borders between geographical gaps, spaces, times and different cultures. To express feelings such as absence, love or remembrance, Tuan Mami chose to use the ritual and hobby of knitting - inspired by a lot of stories and old myths of Vietnamese women who stayed quiet and lonely waiting for their beloved ones to come back home from the battle zone safely. These were women who knitted sweaters and scarves to send to their men as a symbol of protection and as a love message. By utilizing the old myths, Tuan Mami creates a platform in the gallery space for Vietnamese women in South Korea where they not only enact a knitting ritual, but also where they can meet each other and share their stories. =Physicality (2013)= The artwork is based on research done at Room 1, Nha San Collective space at Zone 9, Hanoi - the former Central Pharmaceutical Factory II, which originated from Army Medical Department Pharmaceutical Factory (established in 1947 with the purpose of producing medicines for the army). The permeation of perennial chemicals makes the room reeked of medicines and it is deeply ingrained in the humid walls, creating a haunting atmosphere about life, death and the invisible existence of the physical world. Tuan Mami chose the most suitable cacti to grow in boxes filled with of humid wall mortar from Room 1 itself to and then put the cacti there right in the room. Through the retention and transformation of material, the material itself becomes a historical existence.tudiennhasan.com/2013/12/07/tuan-mami-2/ =The Utopia (2012)= Tuan Mami covered Japan Foundation Library floor with 100 kg of rice seeds and a thick sheet of glass. This installation created a field of rice - an ‚Äúutopia‚Äù within a normal library. The pressed rice seeds by glass gradually grew day by day even without water and soil throughout the exhibition duration. The visitors might paradoxically feel the freedom of the rice plants that grow in such difficult conditions as well as the risky and impossible temptation of touching to feel the rice plant. In the exhibition opening, Tuan Mami invited his mother to be an art tour guide and invited 100 of her female friends to come to visit the exhibition. It was the first time in their life to see an art exhibition. The artworks re-constructs the relationship between different generations, between audience-art-artist-artspace, re-analyzes the definition of social view while dig into the structure of an artwork. =1000 Art Objects Which Have Lost Their Context (2012)= Inspired by the questions: What is art? What have artists used to present their art practice? Tuan Mami made a book classifying daily life/art objects. He chose single images of things that exist around us and that are in our lives, then separated them from their context and reproduce them on transparency paper. All the images represent the temporality of life, of culture, and of the worlds surrounding our life. =Protest Against The Void No.2= The work includes an Artist, a Gallerist, a Couple, and a Young man. They are anonymous actors with particular actions. The audience is directed to go through an art manifesto made by rice powder, a hidden masturbating man, a hidden couple having sex, a young man who fighting intensely with the void corner by using chilly powder. In the performance, Tuan Mami created a sort of mysterious space but with a realistic orientation. An ambiguous play drives people to the zone of knowing and unknowing. Exhibitions Tuan Mami has participated in international art events and exhibitions including Plastic Myths, Asian Culture Center, Korea (2015) Changwon Sculpture Biennale (2014); Pharmacide Project, Traveling Between Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, And France (2012) ; Beyond Pressure; Burma (2011), The 7th Asia-Europe Art Camp ‚Äì Art Workshop Luxembourg/Shanghai (2009-2010); Institute of Contemporary art in Singapore(2011); A Crossroads At The Institute Of Contemporary Art Singapore (2011); Utopia, Japan Foundation, Hanoi, (2012); Celebration Of Our Moment And Farewell Party, Halle 6, Munich (2011); And What Is Mom Waiting For?, Hooyong Art Center, South Korea (2011); H√† n·ªôi- Berlin, Berlin(2009).

It is responsible for about 9% of brain 2-AG hydrolysis. Together, ABHD12 along with two other enzymes, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and ABHD6, control 99% of 2-AG hydrolysis in the brain. ABHD12 also serves as a lysophospholipase and metabolizes lysophosphatidylserine (LPS).  Protein structure  ABHD12 is a ‚âà45 kDa integrated membrane glycoprotein, with an active site proposed to face into the extracellular space. Currently, the crystal structure of ABHD12 is not known.  Function  ABHD12 is a lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) lipase responsible for regulation of immune and neurological processes, and shown to act on the endocannabinoid arachidonoylglycerol (AG) as a monoacylglycerol lipase. Endocannabinoids are associated with a range of physiological processes. ABHD12 acts on 2-AG, and accounts for approximately 9% of 2-AG hydrolysis in the brain. Along with MAGL and ABHD6, ABHD12 is responsible for 99% of 2-AG hydrolysis in the brain, and has also been shown to act on the 1(3)-AG isomer. Based on the extracellular face of the ABHD12 active site and its ability to act on multiple isomeric substrates, ABHD12 has been suggested to act as a guard to the extracellular 2-AG-CB2R signalling pathway in microglia, and peripheral 2-AG signalling, however this has not been confirmed. ABHD12 transcription is abundant in the brain, specifically microglia, but has also been identified in peripheral cell types like macrophages and osteoclasts. Murine models have shown ABHD12 plays a role in regulation of lysophosphatidylserine pathways in the brain.  Clinical significance  Mutations that compromise the catalytic activity of ABHD12 have been causally linked to the rare neurodegenerative disease PHARC (polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts) and a small proportion of retinitis pigmentosa.  History  Identification of ABHD12 was first reported in genetic profiling of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in 1995. In 2010, mutations in ABHD12 were reported as a causal link for the neurodegenerative disease PHARC .  Mutations  Mutations in ABHD12 are associated with the rare neurodegenerative disorder PHARC, as well as retinitis pigmentosa. Null mutations have been shown to lead to development of PHARC, while other mutations can result in a range of phenotypes, from non-syndromic retinal degeneration to PHARC. Currently, PHARC has been identified in at least 27 individuals, with 15 identified loss of function variants of ABHD12, comprising four nonsense, four missense, four frameshift and one splicing mutation. ABHD12 missense mutations have been identified in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa, and a growing range of phenotypes associated with ABHD12 mutations from PHARC to non-syndromic retinal degeneration are being discovered. In vitro, enzymatic activity of ABHD12 can be eliminated by site mutation the residues Serine-246, Aspartate-333, or Histidine-372, which form a catalytic triad in the hydrolase domain.  Inhibitors  Inhibitors of ABHD12 have been identified. Orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin; THL) and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), so-called \\"universal lipase/serine hydrolase inhibitors\\" that are extremely non-selective enzyme inhibitors, were found to inhibit ABHD12. Selective reversible inhibitors have also been identified, including betulinic acid, maslinic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid.  Models  The Œ±/Œ≤ hydrolase domain including lipase motif and catalytic triad is conserved between murine and human ABHD12. Based on the observation of ABHD12 mutation in PHARC affected subjects, PHARC cell lines have been considered as human models of ABHD12 knockout. Mouse knockout (ABHD12 -/-) models demonstrate cerebellar microgliosis, motor and auditory impairment, alongside elevated neuroinflammation with progression associated with age. These characteristics are considered PHARC-like phenotypes as a murine model for human PHARC, however the mouse knockout model doesn‚Äôt demonstrate ocular or myelination defects, or early onset typical of PHARC. The ABHD -/- murine model shows increased long-chain lysoPS accumulation in the brain suggesting lysoPS signalling contributes to PHARC-like pathology. A zebrafish knockdown (+/-) model has been developed which demonstrates ophthalmic defects including microphthalmia, lack of lens clarity, and disrupted retina architecture.  Interactions  Elevated lysoPS accumulation in ABHD12 knockout mice suggests lysoPS as an in vivo substrate of ABHD12. Elevated lysoPS production in ABHD12 null cells from PHARC subjects can be reversed using an inhibitor of ABHD16A. In vitro studies demonstrate enzymatic hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol long lipid chains by ABHD12. ABHD12 can use both 1(3)-AG and 2-AG as substrates at comparable enzymatic rates. ABHD12 has been shown to be associated with AMPA type glutamate receptors in the brains of rats.

It advocates showing respect for a baby‚Äôs experience and encourages parents to treat their children as active participants rather than passive objects. The name RIE is also used to describe the approach to childcare that the organization advocates. RIE was founded by the educator Magda Gerber and the pediatric neurologist Thomas Forrest in 1978. It rose to prominence in the 21st century, when it was adopted by Early Head Start programs.  History  The roots of RIE go back to Hungary in the 1930s. Magda Gerber worked with the pediatrician Emmi Pikler at Loczy, also known as The Pikler Institute, an orphanage located in Budapest, Hungary, and named after the street of which it was located. Their approach was based on documented, naturalistic observations of many hundreds of babies. After the Second World War, Gerber took what she learned from Pikler and morphed it into an approach that could be used for parents and their children naming it the Educaring Approach. Respect and Authenticity are the basis for RIE and the Educaring Approach. In the late 1950s, the family fled to Los Angeles. Together with Tom Forrest, Gerber established RIE in her new home in 1978. The group remained there until her death in 2007. When Gerber‚Äôs family sold her house, the group moved to a space on Melrose Avenue. The method attracted media attention when several celebrities started attending RIE baby groups or employing RIE educators. They included Hollywood stars Tobey Maguire, Pen√©lope Cruz, Helen Hunt, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jason Alexander, and Felicity Huffman and her husband William H. Macy, as well as fashion designer Minnie Mortimer and her husband, screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, and L.A. Philharmonic conductor Gustavo Dudamel. In Hollywood, the requests for nannies knowledgeable in RIE increased in 2015. In 2009, the Resources for Infant Educarers group started offering teacher training in Manhattan. The organization also has outposts in New York, Sacramento, Santa Cruz, Boulder, Tulsa, Tampa and Melbourne, Fla., as well as in Alberta and Ontario. In addition to parenting classes and educator certification, RIE publishes parenting books, teaching manuals, and DVDs. In October 2010, the method went mainstream as RIE teaching materials arrived at 1,700 federally funded Early Head Start programs for families with infants and toddlers nationally.  Method  RIE advocates showing respect for a baby‚Äôs experience, such as talking to them in a clear simple way but without ‚Äúbaby talk.‚Äù Parents are helped to raise self-confident, self-reliant and co- operative children. RIE opposes the trend of helicopter parenting and advises \\"stepping back and giving your baby a chance to develop at her own pace rather than constantly bothering her with stimulating activities and educational toys\\". This is achieved by interpreting cries as communication, rather than alarms; by making a safe, quiet environment filled with simple toys that promote active imaginations (no mobiles or TVs); and by taking a backseat instead of steering the baby toward a certain place or goal. Objects that are considered disrespectful to a baby include sippy cups, high chairs, baby gyms, baby carriers, baby swaddles, and baby walkers, which Gerber called \\"a moving prison.\\" Parents practising RIE tell their children what they‚Äôre doing with them and why, such as asking them if they can pick them up and pausing so they can be prepared. Parents are taught the method in weekly sessions for children from three months to three years. Many of the babies who attend RIE classes subsequently attend Montessori pre-schools. The more devoted parents are encouraged to take RIE training, where adult students experience what it feels like to be ignored or over-parented. The RIE philosophy is explained in the book \\"Baby Knows Best\\" by Deborah Carlisle Solomon, who was the executive director of RIE for eight years. RIE has been described as \\"a kinder, gentler, slowed down way of parenting\\", encouraging parents to treat their children as active participants rather than passive objects.

Developed between about 1880 and 1930, the neighborhood has a collection of 15 historically significant well- preserved worker housing units. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Williams Street Extension is a residential dead end street in the northwestern part of Bellows Falls, running west from Atkinson Road (United States Route 5) to end at a steep hillside at its western end. Myrtle Street, another residential street, ends in a T junction roughly midway through its length. The street has eighteen primary residential structures, most of which are two or three story multiunit wood frame buildings. All have slate roofs, and most have wooden clapboard or shingle siding, although some have been clad in synthetic siding. They are basically vernacular in style, with elements of the Queen Anne revival predominant, although Greek Revival and Colonial Revival features are also found in a few buildings. The Williams Street Extension was developed beginning about 1880, in order to address the need for worker housing in the industries of Bellows Falls, Rockingham's most populous and economically significant village. The area was platted out as early as 1872, when the land was owned by the Bellows Falls Canal Company. Between 1880 and 1900 twelve of the street's buildings were built, and the last major construction took place in 1920. Since then, only modest alterations have taken place, including the addition or loss of outbuildings, changes in siding materials, and minor alterations to building exteriors. Residents who lived here were typically employed either by the railroads that served the village, or the paper companies that had plants here.

Design and description The Bangor class was initially to be a scaled down minesweeper design of the in Royal Navy service.Brown, p. 124Chesneau (1980), p. 61 However, due to the difficulty procuring diesel engines led to the small number of the diesel version being completed.

They were long with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 185 However, the size of the ship led to criticisms of their being too cramped for magnetic or acoustic minesweeping gear. This may have been due to all the additions made during the war with the installation of ASDIC, radar and depth charges. The Bangor class came in two versions. Transcona was of the diesel-powered version, being equipped with a 9-cylinder diesel engine driving two shafts that produced . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The vessels carried of oil. The vessels had a complement of 6 officers and 77 ratings. The Canadian diesel-powered Bangors were armed with a single quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt gun mounted forward. The ships were also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII gun aft and were eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 58 For those ships assigned to convoy duty, they were armed with two depth charge launchers and two chutes for the 40 depth charges they carried. Service history Transcona was ordered as part of the 1940‚Äì41 building programme. The minesweeper's keel was laid on 18 December 1940 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel, Quebec. The ship was launched on 26 April 1941 and Transcona was commissioned at Sorel on 25 November 1942. She was the last Bangor to join the Royal Canadian Navy.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 188 After commissioning, Transcona escorted to Halifax, Nova Scotia and remained at the shipyard there from 22 December 1942 to 6 March 1943 due to engine defects. Once those were repaired, the minesweeper performed her workups and was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in April. In June, WLEF's escorts were divided into groups and Transcona was placed in W-2. She remained with that unit until May 1944 when the minesweeper was transferred to Halifax Force, a local escort force based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 23 December, with sister ship and the frigate , Transcona sailed from Halifax on a pre-convoy escort submarine sweep of the swept channel near the Sambro Light Vessel. While the convoy was forming up, the fired a torpedo which hit Clayoquot, sinking the minesweeper. Transcona dropped four Carley floats for the survivors while searching for the submarine. Ten minutes after Clayoquots sinking, a torpedo detonated close to Transcona. The submarine was not found and the corvette collected survivors.Darlington and McKee, pp. 197‚Äì99 From February to May 1945, Transcona was under refit at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She remained with this unit until June, after which the ship was deployed on various local tasks until her decommissioning. The minesweeper was paid off on 31 July 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and laid up. On 1 September 1945, Transcona was transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Marine Division and renamed French.

The label's hook for this new group would be that its members were international, to appeal to a larger fan base. Auditions were held, and the five members selected represented five distinct nationalities. Kate Macalino, from the Philippines, had worked as a model in her home country. Tal B.

History  The first Liulin device was developed in 1986‚Äì1988 time period for the scientific program of the second Bulgarian cosmonaut for the flight on MIR space station. All Liulin type dosimetric instruments use one or more silicon detectors and measure the deposited energy and number of particles into the detector(s) when charged particles hit the device, that allowing it to calculate the dose rate and particle flux. The measurements in the LIULIN instrument were based on a single silicon detector followed by a charge- sensitive shaping amplifier (CSA). The number of the pulses at the output of CSA above a given threshold was proportional to the particle flux hitting the detector; the amplitude of the pulses at the output of CSA was proportional to the particles deposited energy. Further the integral of the energy depositions of the particles accumulated in the detector during the measurement interval allowed calculation of the dose rate.

The haunt of royals and car dealers, gangsters and landed aristocrats, it was a fixture in London nightlife, with the most famous years of the club being the decades between 1950 and 1970. The Astor was one of the most prestigious of a number of nightclubs and \\"hostess clubs\\" which flourished particularly in the period between the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the opening of the 1960s and 1970s discoth√®ques. Such watering- holes had almost all disappeared by the 1980s, when discos and nightclubs merged into the nocturnal \\"clubs\\" of those years, a situation which led up to the present-day London night-time economy.  Bertie Green  The Astor was established in the 1930s and flourished even during the dangerous times London experienced during the Second World War, including London Blitz of 1940-1941 and the V-1 and V-2 rocket attacks of 1944-1945. The venue was owned by Bertie Green, a businessman and manager of show business performers. Green has been described by Michele Monro, daughter of Matt Monro, as \\"[not] one of nature's gentlemen. He had a very bad reputation as a villain and used to sign artists up with the sole intention of doing nothing and then suing them... a greedy bastard, a no-good greedy bastard.\\"  Postwar London nightlife  Like the Stork Room, an attempt to copy the American Stork Club in Manhattan, the Astor was one of the London nightclubs which attracted wealthy revellers, members of the aristocracy, young Guards officers and occasionally minor royals, as well as successful criminals (both \\"working\\" criminals and gangsters). Other clubs vied for the same clientele, or, in contrast, attracted very niche crowds. They included the Embassy Club, the Blue Angel, Annabel's (founded only in 1963, more select than the others, originally the haunt of the very wealthy and the aristocracy; still operating), the Gargoyle Club, the Bagatelle, the Continental, the Colony Room (not to be confused with the Colony Club), Churchill's (a hostess club which existed until about 1990, was later revived as New Churchill's and still operates), the Gaslight Club (still operating in different format), the Pink Elephant Club (gay), Danny la Rue's (drag) etc. There was also The Saddle Room, which (despite the horsey-set name, aristocratic and royal clientele and off-Park Lane address) was one of the first discotheques in London, the disco trend having begun in Paris and on the Cote d'Azur. In a London still very class-riven, these clubs provided a place where a wide spectrum of London society rubbed shoulders. It has been said of the Gargoyle that \\"its membership embraced toffs and artists: from Nancy Cunard to Nancy Mitford, Victor Rothschild to Roland Penrose, Lee Miller to William Burroughs, and, occasionally in the mix, the odd spy, such as Guy Burgess.\\" The famous American syndicated columnist Walter Winchell wrote in 1953 that \\"there's more night-life in London than anywhere in U.S... Everyone dines after theater--shows start at 6.15 and 8.30... Great Latin band at the Astor Club...\\"  Patrons and reputation  The Astor was usually described in the press as in such terms as \\"glittering\\", \\"ritzy\\", \\"chic\\" and, in the American newspapers, \\"swanky\\". Princess Margaret, younger sister of the Queen, no stranger to London nightlife (and what was then called \\"cafe society\\" in contradistinction to \\"Society\\"), was seen at the Astor on occasion, as in 1952, when she and her entourage enjoyed the performance of the Deep River Boys, a group which mainly sang American gospel music. The Princess described the Deep River Boys as \\"my very favourite entertainers\\". Lord Lichfield (Patrick Anson, aka Patrick Lichfield), cousin of the Queen, ex-Guards officer and fashionable photographer, was often to be seen there in the early 1960s. Another royal personage linked with the Astor was the young King Hussein of Jordan, whom Bertie Green claimed (rather implausibly and somewhat suggestive of lese-majeste) as a friend. Hussein was supposed to have fallen in love with an equally young hostess, Helene Morris. Because Miss Morris was Jewish, the rumours of the affair, including rumours that she was pregnant by the King, threatened to cause a crisis for the King. Green appeared on television and defended King Hussein, flatly denying all of the rumours; he dismissed Miss Morris when the newspapers caught wind of the alleged affair. An account by the transsexual, April Ashley (the first British citizen to have had a sex- change operation performed, albeit in Casablanca) describes the Astor in the early 1960s as having been \\"black tie and full of tarts\\". The Astor in the 1950s has been described as having been \\"littered with prostitutes, which the club politely called hostesses, who'd wait for a table to be filled and then order champagne for the guests at ¬£2 a bottle. They'd get a pound for each bottle purchased, earning up to a tenner on good nights.\\" This at a time when most workers were paid between ¬£2 and ¬£9 per week. It has been said that the Astor clientele was markedly more prestigious in the early 1950s than it became later, especially in the 1960s era of the Krays and others; however, in 1950, long before the active years of the Krays and Richardsons, another habitu√©, George Ellis, had been attacked outside the Astor, slashed with a razor and the girl with him kicked into the gutter, allegedly at the behest of the woman he later married, Ruth Neilson, better known to history as Ruth Ellis, who was later to be hanged for the murder of another of her lovers. Ruth was a club hostess herself, though not at the Astor.  Artistes and showbusiness  Bertie Green, the owner of the Astor, discovered the British singer Yana, who shot to fame in the 1950s after having sung as a dare and at a private party held at the club. Another singer who first performed (solo) at the Astor (in 1959) was the 1960s star Kathy Kirby. Yana was not the only amateur singer to have been offered a job at the Astor by Bertie Green. In 1957, he suggested to American tennis player Althea Gibson, who had just won the Ladies' Singles tournament at Wimbledon and who had sung for fun at a private party held at the Astor to celebrate her victory, that there was a job for her if she wanted to take it (she didn't). Other singers, famous or about to be so, performed at the Astor in the 1950s and early 1960s. Tom Jones sang there, though he was not top of the bill. That position was taken by Engelbert Humperdinck. Tom Jones was still almost unknown to the British public and is said to have been so hungry at that stage of his career that‚îÄ while supporting Humperdinck at the Astor---he stole and ate a steak about to be served to one of the Kray twins, the most notorious British gangsters of their era. At that time the Krays were getting a \\"pension\\" (i.e. protection money) of ¬£200 per week (arguably, ¬£10,000-¬£20,000 or more in 2016 money) from the Astor management. It was when she was singing at the Astor in 1955 that Shirley Bassey was discovered by bandleader and impresario Jack Hylton. Others who were auditioned there and taken on for a while included singers Elkie Brooks and Anita Harris, amid many whose fame was lesser or fleeting.  Gangsters  The address of the Astor, off Berkeley Square, Mayfair, reinforced its \\"respectable\\" credentials, despite the fact that gangland not infrequently came to clubland, as when the psychopathic gangster, Frankie Fraser, buried a hatchet in the skull of one Eric Mason, an associate of the Krays, outside the club (Mason was later dumped, \\"barely alive\\", outside Whitechapel Hospital in East London). However wealthy and respectable were many of the Astor's patrons and despite the royal visits, London gangsterism was never very far away from the club, as when (in 1956) the notorious gangster, Billy Hill, was accused, in the course of a trial, of having offered a \\"monkey\\" (¬£500) and the cost of plastic surgery to a man, if that man would allow himself to be slashed across the face outside the Astor. In 1958, the doorman at the Astor, Jimmy Nash, a member of a \\"well-known\\" London family, was tried at the Old Bailey for murder, at the time a capital offence. The accusation was that he had shot and killed a man in a club in the‚Äîat the time‚Äîvery disreputable area of West London known as Notting Hill. He was acquitted amid talk of \\"jury nobbling\\" and interference with witnesses, but the following year was accused of Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH), convicted and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. It was at the Astor in December 1965 that the infamous East End (East London) Kray twins had a confrontation with the South London criminals known as the Richardson Gang; during that face-off, the gangster George Cornell is said to have referred to Ronnie Kray as a \\"fat poofter\\" (in another version, \\"a big fat poof\\"), a remark which led to a gangland war (Cornell himself being shot dead in March 1966 in front of witnesses at the bar of the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel) and so, ultimately, to the trials and sentences which destroyed both the Kray and Richardson gangs. Indeed, when the Krays were arrested for the Cornell murder (two years after the fact), they were drinking (at 6 a.m.) at The Lion pub, Bethnal Green, intending to move on later to the Astor.  Later years  The Astor survived beyond the era of the Krays and Richardsons and continued to attract wealthy customers. An Astor Big Band was formed by bandleader Terry Steel; it played before Frank Sinatra at the club in 1971 and outlived its original one-month engagement, playing for five years and becoming particularly popular in Denmark, where it performed at the famous Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. It re-formed, for a charity performance, as late as 2015. The Astor Club closed in the late 1970s.

Eligibility A means-test, similar to that for Income Support is applied unless the application is made for the benefit of a child or a young person under the age of 19. The first ¬£6,000 of any savings are ignored. The applicant must be an owner occupier, a private tenant, a landlord with a disabled tenant, housing association tenant; or a local authority tenant. However, many councils have separate budgets and staff to deliver adaptations to their tenants . Provision Local authorities may carry out the work either through provision of money to the applicant or through an agency service. Where an agency service is offered grant applicants are not obliged to take this up in order to receive a grant. In order for adaptation's to be provided an occupational therapist is usually required to carry out an assessment of the needs of the applicant. A grant can be used for adaptations to give better freedom of movement into and around the home and/or to provide essential facilities within it. Examples of the work which may be covered by this assistance are: *widening doors and installing ramps *providing or improving access to rooms and facilities - for example, by installing a stair lift or providing a downstairs bathroom *bathroom conversion e.g. providing level access shower, accessible WC and wash hand basin *improving or providing a heating system which is suitable for the disabled person's needs *improving access to and movement around the home to enable you to care for another person who lives in the property, such as a child *alterations to door widths and ramps *specialist equipment i.e. baths/ kitchens The maximum mandatory value of works is ¬£30,000 in England; however the local authority can use discretionary powers to increase the value of works. Performance Home improvement agencies generally help people to apply for a grant working with occupational therapists to design the adaptations and arranging for contractors to carry out the work. The average payment in 2015 was a little less than ¬£7,000 and about ¬£300 million a year is spent. From 2015 the funding is transferred to the Better Care Fund. In most areas home improvement agencies (HIAs) help people to apply for a DFG by working with occupational therapists to design the adaptations and then arranging for contractors to carry out the works ‚Äì taking the stress out of the process and assuring a fit for purpose solution.

Mary Phinney von Olnhausen (1818‚Äì1902) was an American nurse, abolitionist, and diarist. Historians look to the book extracted from her diaries -- \\"Adventures of an Army Nurse in Two Wars\\" to understand the medical techniques of the Civil War. Born in Massachusetts to Elias and Catherine Bartlett Phinney, a lawyer and her mother the daughter of a doctor, Phinney was well educated at several academies. When her father died in 1849 at age 69, the farm was sold and she \\"sought employment as a designer of print goods\\" at the mills. There she met Gustav, Baron von Olnhausen (‚Äì1860) who left Saxony after the 1848 unrest and financial troubles, which led to selling of his castle. He was making a meager living as a chemist in a dye-house of the Manchester Mills. They married when she was 40 years old on May 1, 1858 and he died two years later in 1860. During the US Civil War, von Olnhausen served as a nurse at the Mansion House Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia and Mansfield General Hospital at Morehead, North Carolina. After the war, she was discharged in August 1865, returning home to help raise her brother's children in Illinois. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, she volunteered to serve as a nurse with the Prussian Army and was accepted on the basis of being the Baroness von Olnhausen. She served in field hospitals in Meung and Vendome, work for which she was awarded an Iron Cross in 1873 by Kaiser Wilhelm I. She died in Boston in April, 1902. Fictional portrayal In 2015, the PBS Masterpiece Theatre series-produced the twelve-episode cancelled miniseries, Mercy Street, about the Mansion House Hospital, where Phinney was stationed, that relied heavily on her diaries.

His beatification process is ongoing.  Life = Childhood = A son of Italian immigrants established in Southern Brazil, John was born in S√£o Jo√£o do Pol√™sine to simple and pious peasant family, that prayed the Rosary every evening. The third of nine brothers, when he was 10 years old he says to his father that he would like to become a Catholic priest. For that reason, he goes to study in the Pallotines seminary in Vale V√™neto, not far from his hometown. After some 10 months there, he decides to return to his home, because of his poor physical health. At 14, he begins to have serious sight problems, so he could not continue his school studies. For the same reason, he was not deemed fit for military service. Years later, John will say about his health: \\"God, in his infinite goodness, did not deem me incapable. He employed me as such I am and entrusted me to his Mother for the Campaign of the Holy Rosary. No one is unable to serve God.\\" = Husband and father = He marries at the age of 23 and has two children, but at 28 his wife dies. He had moved to the city of Santa Maria during the illness of his wife. It is in this city that, at 32 and with two young children, he forms a new household by marrying Victoria Filipetto, with whom he has five other children. He quits his occupation of peasant to open a small shop in the front part of his house. He becomes very respected by the people of his town, especially thanks to his honesty. He said: \\"I could be a rich man, but I applied only the legitimate profit margin; you can't get what belongs to others.\\" This practice was very different from that of other traders at the time, who sold goods by twice the price they were purchased. = The first contacts with Schoenstatt = It is in 1947 that his life crosses the path of the Schoenstatt Movement. He begins his journey of spiritual formation with the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary and Father Celestino Trevisan. He participates in the blessing of the foundation stone of the Schoenstatt Shrine in Santa Maria. In this ceremony is present Fr. Joseph Kentenich, founder of Schoenstatt. This fact will mark him forever: \\"I felt like a little pupil of Father Kentenich,\\" said Pozzobon later. \\"Since when I was twelve I felt a void, a lack of something I did not understand. But from that time, I discovered that it was the lack of God and His Mother.\\" John Pozzobon carrying the Pilgrim Mother pictureJohn sealed his Covenant of Love with Mary on 11 April 1948,A consecration to Our Lady according to the Schoenstatt spirituality. the day of the blessing and inauguration of the Shrine in Santa Maria. = The beginnings of the Pilgrim Mother Campaign = In 1950, Pope Pius XII had called a Holy Year for the Church. On 1 November of that year would see the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In September, John had attended, with a hundred men, a series of spiritual exercises that Father Celestino Trevisan had given with Sister Teresinha Gobbo. They discussed the importance of praying the Rosary and how to stimulate a prayer crusade in the families. On 10 September 1950, a replica of the Mater Ter Admirabilis picture, present in the Schoenstatt Shrine is blessed and entrusted to John Pozzobon for that he goes to pray the Rosary with the image in families. \\"In that moment, I understood that the goodness and mercy of God and the Mother and Queen had given me a great evangelizing mission: the Holy Rosary Campaign.\\" He is convinced that \\"when something comes from God, one man can move the world. I said to Mary: 'I have seven children and a wife, and I am accountable to God for my children and my wife. But if it is the will of God and Yours, one man can move mountains.' But all went well. In the early years, I had dedicated to the Mother and Queen two hours a day of my time. When the children were already older and could work in the shop, I passed to dedicate myself fully to the Campaign. If God wants that someone performs a task, He also concedes the time to dedicate to his family.\\" Requests to receive the visit of the Mother Thrice Admirable picture were increasing. John remains in his store in the morning and, after delivering all orders, he leaves the counter to his wife or children to spend the afternoon by visiting the families to pray the rosary. He begins to visit schools, hospitals and even prisons in the region. And always on foot, carrying the image on his back, weighing over . John also organizes \\"missions\\" in the villages: he brings the picture in the villages and families gather to pray the Rosary. Then he preaches the Gospel, speaks about conversion and inquires about the material and spiritual status of families. So he leaves the village and returns a few days later, bringing material aid and also a priest to celebrate Mass, to confess and marry couples and to baptize children.The Pilgrim Mother's smaller image used todayAnd then the fruits begin to appear. Many families return to the Church; pilgrimages to the Schoenstatt Shrine are organized; Eucharistic adoration is established in several parishes; farmers build chapels in villages. = Development of the Campaign = Over time, John cannot arrive alone to do more visits with the Pilgrim Image; then the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary make copies of the pilgrim image, but in a smaller size to make it easier its transportation by other voluntaries, that visit thirty families each with them. On 30 December 1972, he is ordained Permanent Deacon by Bishop Eric Ferrari. Deacon John Pozzobon is therefore put to severe hardship. At first, his work is not understood and it is often criticized. But he remains in obedience to his bishop and his parish priest. \\"Sometimes, forlorn, I asked myself: What am I doing? I give up what is most dear to me, away from my family, alone in this way. Then I realized: I bring the Mother of God. The world needs heroism. And that gave me back the strength and courage to go on.\\" = Commitment to the poorest = John visiting a peasant family Around 1955, Jean founded the \\"Noble Village of Charity,\\" where he builds free homes for the poor who lived with his family in the streets: \\"There, I understood the meaning of the Via Crucis, the distress of the Christ that we can only imagine. The suffering of our brothers caused by those who make no effort to sacrifice for the other. I trust in the Divine Providence. I have never been a rich man, but I know God does not forsake those who serve his neighbor. Once, I received a small amount of money that made possible the purchase of a lot of land and the necessary building material. Generous people have contributed, hands were put to work, and in a few time the first houses were built.\\" After that, Pozzobon and a group of volunteers began to distribute clothes, food and educate the people of the Village of Charity to the work. They also planted fruit trees and flowers. Their objective was to help the poor to conquest dignity and self-respect. \\"I wanted so much to change this world so dominated by materialism. Bring Jesus, bring His message, and that all became good and loved each other. I felt a lot of strength and joy, and I put myself at the disposal of the Mother to accept all the sacrifices she sent me. For love to this sacred image, I've had two thousand different beds in the darkness of the night, among the lilies of the fields and the woods. She always accompanied me in the long marches, crossing valleys and rivers, and when I was sitting by the road and said to her, 'Mom, I cannot stand it anymore!' When I passed by humiliations and hardships, she always accompanied me. With only my strength I could never have done all this. = Pozzobon's death and the continuation of his work = Pope John Paul II blesses the first Pilgrim Mother, on 1984 On 15 June 1985, John offers his life in the Sanctuary for the flourishing of the Rosary Campaign. On the morning of 27 June 1985, Deacon John Pozzobon is deadly hit by a truck in the middle of a thick fog in Santa Maria while on his way to the Shrine of Our Lady of Schoenstatt to attend Mass, as he did every day. The Pilgrim Mother Campaign, according to the wishes of Pozzobon, continues to flourish. It is now present in over 100 countries worldwide, in the six continents. Even in Antarctica there is a statue of Our Lady of Schoenstatt, in a scientific research station. Pozzobon traveled more than with the image of the Pilgrim Mother of Schoenstatt in his almost 40 years of apostolate. Recent data from the Campaign secretariat in Brazil indicates that today only in this country there are almost two and a half million families receiving the pilgrim image of the Mother Thrice Admirable, what represents one in every seven Brazilian Catholics. = Canonization process = His canonization process was opened in 1994 in the diocese of Santa Maria. In May 2009 the diocesan phase has been completed and the case was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. Its Roman phase began on 3 June 2009, just a week after the arrival of the more than 10,800 documents instructing the cause, which surprised its postulators, who expected a much longer await, between three months and one year for the reception of the case at the Vatican. Since then, John Pozzobon can be called \\"Servant of God\\".  Bibliography  Uriburu, Esteban. A Hero Today, Not Tomorrow: The Life of John Louis Pozzobon a Poor Pilgrim and Deacon, 1904‚Äì1985.

It was developed by Ornstein and Davis. This method produces high resolution and good band definition. It is widely used technique for separating proteins according to size and charge. Method In this method, the gel is divided into two parts, resolving and stacking gel, both have different concentrations of polyacrylamide. The one with lower concentration is stacked on top of the one with higher concentration. Discontinuity is based on four parameters: gel structure, pH value of the buffer, ionic strength of the buffer, and the nature of the ions in the gel and electrode buffer. The electrode buffer contains glycine. Glycine has very low net charge at pH 6.8 of stacking gel, so it has low mobility. The proteins are separated according to the principle of isotachophoresis and form stacks in the order of mobility (stacking effect). Mobility depends on net charge, not on the size of the molecule. Proteins move towards anode slowly at constant speed till they reach limit of separation gel. Suddenly, frictional resistance increases but glycine is not affected and it passes the proteins and becomes highly charged in resolving zone. Proteins present in homogeneous buffer start to separate based on principles of zone electrophoresis. Now their mobility depends on size as well as charge. pH value rises to 9.5 and net charge increases.Disc Electrophoresis and Related Techniques of Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Author H. R.

It is now displayed in the Cloisters in New York City.

History of a theft.\\" historia-y-arte.com The Spanish confiscation was the Spanish government's seizure and sale of property, including from the Catholic Church, from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. It was a long historical, economic, and social process beginning with the so-called \\"Confiscation of Godoy\\" in 1798‚Äîalthough there was an earlier precedent during the reign of Charles III of Spain‚Äîand ending on 16 December 1924. Confiscation consisted of the forced expropriation of land and property from the \\"mortmains\\" (i.e., the Catholic Church and religious orders, which had accumulated it from grants, wills, and intestates) and from municipalities. The government then sold the property on the market or through public auctions. A similar phenomenon occurred in other countries, such as Mexico.For example, in Mexico, the Law of confiscation of the rural and urban properties of the civil and religious corporations of Mexico, nicknamed the lerdo law, was issued on 25 June 1856 by President Ignacio Comonfort. 500 years of Mexico in documents: Lerdo Law. Law of confiscation of properties of the church and corporations The principal goal in Spain was to obtain money to pay off the public debt securities, known as vales reales, that the state issued to finance itself. The government also hoped to increase national wealth, to create a bourgeoisie and a middle class of farmers who owned the lands they cultivated, and to foster capitalist conditions (e.g., privatization and a strong financial system) so that the state could collect more taxes. Confiscation was one of the political weapons with which Spanish liberals modified the system of ownership of the Ancien R√©gime during the first half of the 19th century.  Confiscation in the Ancien R√©gime = Proposals of Olavide and Jovellanos = A portrait of Pablo de Olavide by Juan Moreno Tejada, painted before 1805. Officials attributed the struggles of Spanish agriculture during the Ancien R√©gime to the amount of amortized property held by the \\"mortmains\\" (primarily the Church and municipalities). These lands were generally poorly cultivated and remained outside the market because they were inalienable‚Äîthat is, they could not be sold, mortgaged or given away. This led to an increase in the price of \\"free\\" land, and the amortized property was not taxable because of the privileges of its owners. In a report in 1787, Jos√© Mo√±ino, the 1st Count of Floridablanca and minister to Charles III, complained of \\"major damages of the amortization\\". Pablo de Olavide and Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos both proposed selling disused solars: uncultivated and uninhabited municipal lands that were generally used as pasture for cattle. Olavide viewed the protection given to livestock as a cause of agricultural backwardness and argued that \\"all the lands should be put to work\\". Under his proposal, disused solars would be sold mainly to the rich, because they had the means to cultivate the land, with a smaller number reserved for farmers who had two pairs of oxen. The proceeds would be used to establish a provincial savings bank that would provide funds for public works such as roads, canals and bridges. Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, portrayed by Goya.Jovellanos's proposal was much more radical, because unlike Olavide‚Äîwho called for the sale only of disused solars, thereby respecting municipal resources‚Äîhe suggested privatizing \\"council lands\\", including municipal properties that brought in tax revenue. Jovellanos, a fervent supporter of economic liberalism, defended the \\"free and absolute\\" sale of these properties, with no distinctions among the potential buyers. Unlike Olavide, he was not worried about the possibility that the land would pass into the hands of a few magnates, because, as noted by Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente, he considered the \\"liberation\\" of disused solars and council lands to be \\"a good in itself\\". Jovellanos's ideas, which were widely disseminated through his 1795 Report on Agrarian Law, influenced the liberals who launched the confiscations of the 19th century much more than Olavide's proposals, which were not as well publicized. Olavide and Jovellanos did not advocate the confiscation of Church property, but they suggested limiting, by peaceful means, the acquisition of more land for ecclesiastical institutions. This proposal was rejected by the Church and by most members of the Royal Council when it was put to a vote in June 1766. Two leaflets defending it were included in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum of the Spanish Inquisition: Report on Agrarian Law (1795), by Jovellanos, and Treaty of the Royalty Payment of Amortization (1765), by Pedro Rodr√≠guez, Count of Campomanes. = Charles III = In an effort to quell the Esquilache Riots in the spring of 1766, the corregidor-intendente of Badajoz ordered the renting of city property to \\"needy neighbors\\", with priority given to day laborers who could work the land. The 10th Count of Aranda, newly appointed by Charles III, extended the measure by royal decree to all of Extremadura on 2 May 1766, and to the whole kingdom the following year. A subsequent order in 1768 explained that the measure was intended to serve the poorest farmers and laborers, to promote the \\"common good\\". However, the measure was repealed on 26 May 1770. Strictly speaking, this measure was not a confiscation, because the land in question was not sold; it was leased and remained the property of the municipalities. The royal decree that replaced it prioritized leases \\"to the laborers of one, two and three yokes\\", thus abandoning the initial social purpose. To justify the change, the government alluded to \\"problems that have followed in the practice of the various provisions issued earlier about distribution of lands\\", referring to the fact that many laborers and poor peasants who had received plots of lands had been unable to cultivate them properly and lacked the means to pay the censuses, since the original decree was not accompanied by loans. Olavide‚Äîwho had openly criticized the first measures because he believed the beneficiaries lacked the means to put the land to full use‚Äîwent on to direct projects in Andalusia and the Sierra Morena region, in which settlers received enough money to begin to cultivate the land they were granted, and were initially exempt from taxes and censuses. As Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente noted, the actions of Charles III were driven more by economic concerns (the need to farm uncultivated land) than by a desire for social reform. However, they were connected to a wider goal of reforming Spain's agricultural economy. = Confiscation of Godoy = During the reign of Charles IV, in September 1798, the Confiscation of Godoy was launched by Mariano Luis de Urquijo and Miguel Cayetano Soler, the Secretary of the Treasury (who had held that position during the government of Manuel Godoy, removed from power six months before). Charles IV obtained permission from the Vatican to expropriate land belonging to the Jesuits and other religious entities, including hospitals, hospices and residential colleges. Altogether, the confiscations accounted for one-sixth of the Church's property. Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente called the Confiscation of Godoy a turning point in linking confiscation to the problems of public debt, unlike the approach taken by Charles III, who presented confiscation as a way to reform (to a very limited extent) the agrarian economy. The subsequent liberal confiscations of the 19th century continued the approach of the Confiscation of Godoy, not that of Charles III.  Confiscation in the 19th century = Joseph Bonaparte (1808‚Äì13) = On 18 August 1809, Joseph Bonaparte ordered the removal of \\"all regular, monastic, mendicant and clerical Orders\\", whose assets would automatically belong to the nation. Many religious institutions were thus dissolved with no consideration of canon law. Bonaparte also ordered a lesser confiscation, which did not seize property, but rather the income derived from property. The money went to support the French troops in the Napoleonic Wars. This confiscation ended in 1814. = Cortes of C√°diz (1810‚Äì14) = Jos√© Canga Arg√ºelles, portrayed by Jos√© Cabana. In March 1811, the deputies of the Cortes of C√°diz (the Spanish national assembly) recognized the huge debt accumulated in the form of vales reales during the reign of Charles IV‚Äîa debt that the acting treasury secretary, Jos√© Canga Arg√ºelles, estimated to be 7 billion reales. After rejecting the argument that the vales reales should only be recognized for their market value‚Äîwhich was well below their nominal value, and would have bankrupted the holders and made it impossible to obtain new loans‚Äîthe Cortes of C√°diz approved a proposal made by Arg√ºelles. The proposal called for the confiscation of certain goods from the mortmains, which would then be auctioned. Two-thirds of the auction price would go toward the payment of national debt securities, which included the vales reales of the previous reign as well as new \\"notes of liquidated credit\\", which were issued from 1808 on to defray the expenses of the War of Spanish Independence. The remainder of the auction proceeds was dedicated to the payment of interest and the capital of the national debt. A decree on 4 January 1813 called for the confiscation of all disused solars in order to provide \\"relief\\" to non-landowning citizens and \\"an award for the meritorious defenders of the homeland\\". To achieve three purposes at once‚Äîfiscal, patriotic and social‚Äîit divided the confiscated property in half. The first portion would be sold at auction, and the proceeds used to pay the national debt. The second would be divided into lots of land to be given for free to people who had served in the war, and for a fee to landless citizens. If the latter recipients failed to pay the fee, they lost the assigned lot, which diminished the social aim proclaimed in the decree. In a decree on 13 September 1813, which included the Arg√ºelles proposal, the term \\"national goods\\" was applied to the properties that were to be confiscated. The targets of the confiscation included supporters of Manuel Godoy, the French, the Knights Hospitaller and four Spanish military orders (the Order of Santiago, Order of Alc√°ntara, Order of Calatrava and Order of Montesa); the convents and monasteries suppressed or destroyed during the war; the farms of the Crown, except sites intended for the service and recreation of the king; and half of the disused municipal solars. This decree was never carried out because of the return of Ferdinand VII and the absolute state, according to Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente, but it established the legal principles and mechanisms of subsequent confiscations. = Trienio Liberal (1820‚Äì23) = In 1820, after the Constitution of 1812 was restored, the Trienio Liberal once again faced the problem of the national debt, which had not been resolved during six years of absolutist rule (1814‚Äì20). On 9 August 1820, the new courts revalidated the Cortes of C√°diz's decree of 13 September 1813, but added properties obtained in the Spanish Inquisition to the list of confiscation targets. The new decree differed from previous ones in that it measured vales reales by their nominal value, which was much higher than the market value. Because the market value of debt securities was so low compared with their nominal value, the cash paid by buyers was much lower than the appraised price‚Äîin some cases, less than 15 percent of the nominal value. As a result, in 1823, some deputies proposed suspending the confiscation decree and the delivering ownership of the properties in question to their tenants. One of these deputies declared that \\"the farms have been taken over by rich capitalists, and these, once they have taken possession of them, have made a new lease, generally increasing the rent to the poor farmer, threatening to spoil if they do not pay on time\\". But despite the criticism, the confiscation process continued unchanged. By an order of 8 November 1820 (which would be replaced by another decree on 29 June 1822), the Trienio revived the Cortes of C√°diz's decree of 4 January 1813 on the sale of unused lands and goods from the municipalities. A decree on 1 October 1820 also included ecclesiastical confiscation, which the Cortes of C√°diz had not addressed. This decree concerned the monasteries of the monastic orders; the regular canons of Saint Benedict, St. Augustine and the Premonstratensians; the convents and colleges of the military orders, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Orders of Saint John of God and the Bethlehemite Brothers; and \\"all other hospitals of any kind\\". Their goods and immovable properties were \\"applied to the public credit\\" as \\"national assets\\" subject to immediate confiscation. A few days later, on 11 October 1820, a law was issued prohibiting real estate purchases by mortmains, a measure first advocated in the 18th century by Rodr√≠guez and Jovellanos. = Confiscation of Mendiz√°bal (1836‚Äì37) = Prime Minister Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal. Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal (prime minister of Queen Regent Maria Christina) and Pascual Madoz (finance minister of Queen Isabel II) were responsible for the two most important liberal confiscations. The 1836 Ecclesiastical Confiscation of Mendiz√°bal, in particular, had major consequences for the economic and social history of Spain. The division of land was entrusted to municipal committees, which took advantage of their power to create large lots that were affordable only for very wealthy oligarchs. Small farmers could not enter competitive bids, and the land was bought by nobles and the urban bourgeoisie, preventing the development of a true middle class that could pull Spain out of stagnation. Because the confiscation applied only to regular clergy members, the Church decided to excommunicate both the sellers and buyers of the land. As a result, most people chose not to buy lots directly. Instead, they made their purchases through intermediaries or strawpersons. = Confiscation of Espartero (1841) = On 2 September 1841, the newly appointed regent, Baldomero Espartero, ordered the confiscation of the estates of the Church and religious orders, with a bill authored by the finance minister, Pedro Surra Rull. The law was repealed three years later. In 1845, during the Moderate Decade, the government tried to restore relations with the Church, leading to the signing of the Concordat of 1851. = Confiscation of Madoz (1855) = During the bienio progresista period (at the forefront of which were Espartero and Leopoldo O'Donnell), Finance Minister Madoz carried out a new confiscation, which was executed with greater control than Mendiz√°bal's. The order was published in La Gaceta de Madrid on 3 May 1855, and the instruction to carry it out was given on 31 May. It included the lands and censuses of the state; of the clergy; of the military orders of Santiago, Alc√°ntara, Montesa and St. John of Jerusalem; of confraternities, sanctuaries and shrines; of a former infante, Don Carlos; and of the mortmains. The religious schools and hospitals of John of God were exempt because they reduced government spending in these areas. Confiscation had long been a subject of confrontation between conservatives and liberals, but there came a time when all political parties recognized the need to put idle assets to use in order to promote Spain's economic development. The application of the Madoz law was suspended on 14 October 1856 but resumed two years later, on 2 October 1858, when O'Donnell was president of the Council of Ministers. The changes of government did not affect the auctions, which continued until the end of the century. Although the Confiscation of Mendiz√°bal has received more attention from historians because of its duration and societal repercussions, the Confiscation of Madoz involved far more sales. In 1867, 198,523 rural properties and 27,442 urban properties were sold. The state collected 7,856,000,000 reales between 1855 and 1895, almost twice that obtained in the Confiscation of Mendiz√°bal. The money went mainly toward the budget deficit, public debt repayment and public works, with 30 million reales per year reserved for the \\"reconstruction and repair\\" of certain churches. The Madoz law has been called a civil confiscation, but this is a misnomer. A large number of farms that had been the common property of the people were, in fact, auctioned, but many more of the properties that were sold had belonged to the Church, and especially to the secular clergy. Nonetheless, the confiscation of farms belonging to rural Spaniards who depended heavily on them condemned millions to emigration and proletarianization in cities. Of all the property auctioned off, it is estimated that 35% belonged to the Church, 15% to charity and 50% to municipalities. The Municipal Statute of 1924, pushed by Jos√© Calvo Sotelo, repealed confiscation laws and thus ended the Confiscation of Madoz.  Consequences = Social = At the time of the confiscations, Spain could be roughly divided into a southern area with a predominance of large estates and a northern area of small and medium-size farms. According to the historian Richard Herr, one result of the confiscations was that the demographics of the two regions diverged dramatically based on the size of the lots put up for auction, and the structure of land ownership changed.Richard Herr: Contemporary Spain, Marcial Pons, Ediciones de Historia S.A., Madrid, 2004, . Small lots were typically bought by the inhabitants of nearby villages, while larger lots were acquired by rich Spaniards who lived in cities, often far away. In the south, very few small farmers had the financial resources to bid for the large estates, which reinforced the region's landlordism. In the north, however, this did not generally happen. Another consequence was the privatization of communal properties that had belonged to the municipalities. Many farmers were deprived of resources on which they depended for survival (e.g., firewood and pastures), which fueled the emigration of the rural population to industrialized areas of the country or to the Americas. This migration reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. = Religious = The confiscations also led to the exclaustration of thousands of religious by the government of the Count of Toreno. The Royal Order of Ecclesiastical Exclaustration of 1835, issued on 25 July, suppressed convents with fewer than twelve professed members. On 8 March 1836, a new decree suppressed virtually all monasteries (with some exceptions, such as Piarists and Hospitallers), and a decree on 29 July 1837 did the same for female convents (except for the Sisters of Charity). Julio Caro Baroja has drawn attention to the figure of the old, exclaustrated priest, who‚Äîunlike young men, many of whom joined the Carlists or the National Militia‚Äîlived \\"enduring their misery, emaciated, teaching Latin in the schools, or doing other underpaid odd jobs\\". Thus, in addition to economic consequences, the suppression of the religious orders had a \\"huge impact on the social history of Spain\\". Caro Baroja quotes the liberal progressivist Ferm√≠n Caballero, who wrote in 1837, shortly after the secularization, that \\"the total extinction of the religious orders is the most gigantic step Spain has taken in the present time; it is the real act of reform and revolution\\". The confiscations also changed the appearance of Spain's cities by secularizing them. For example, Salustiano de Ol√≥zaga, the Basque-born governor of Madrid, tore down 17 convents there. = Economic = The confiscations brought in more than 14 trillion reales from auctions, thus improving public finances. They also increased the nation's agricultural productivity and cultivated acreage, and improved and specialized crops through new investment by landowners. In Andalusia, for example, olive and wine production grew considerably. These gains, however, were accompanied by the negative effects of deforestation.Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente: El proceso de desamortizaci√≥n de la tierra en Espa√±a, Agricultura y sociedad, ISSN 0211-8394, N¬∫ 7, 1978, pp. 11-33 Additionally, most ordinary Spaniards suffered because of the harm done to the subsistence economy when communal lands that had been used primarily for grazing passed into private hands.Francisco Mart√≠ Gilabert: La desamortizaci√≥n espa√±ola, Ediciones Rialp S.A, 2003, = Cultural = The Museum of Fine Arts of Seville has a large collection of confiscated religious art from convents and monasteries of Seville. The building itself was once a convent. Many paintings (including some Romanesque) and monastery libraries were sold at low prices and eventually exported to other countries, though many books also went to public libraries or universities. Others fell into private hands and were lost. The confiscations left numerous buildings of artistic interest, such as churches and monasteries, to ruin, but others, such as the Church of San Mart√≠n in Cu√©llar, were preserved as museums or other public institutions. = Political = One of the goals of the 19th-century confiscations was to consolidate the liberal regime. However, although the people who bought properties in the north formed a new class of small and medium-size landowners who supported the regime, the goal was undermined by large landowners' acquisition of most of the confiscated lots in southern Spain. Around half of the lands that were confiscated had belonged to peasants and other rural people, and rural areas still account for 90% of the territory of Spain. These communal lands supported the peasants' precarious economy, and their confiscation meant the destruction of the peasants' way of life and self-governance. = Ecological = As a result of the confiscations, millions of hectares of forest fell into private hands and were cleared and plowed, causing immense environmental damage that is still visible today. Indeed, the cost of reforestation, ongoing for 70 years, far exceeds what was obtained from the sales. The confiscations of the 19th century were one of the biggest environmental disasters for the Iberian Peninsula in centuries. The Confiscation of Madoz, in particular, resulted in the privatization of huge expanses of publicly owned forest. The oligarchs who bought the land paid, for the most part, with wood obtained from it. Much of the deforestation of the Iberian Peninsula occurred at that time, leading to the extinction of many plant and animal species in the region. = Other = The confiscation of convents contributed to the modernization of Spanish cities, transforming them from cities dominated by religious structures to bourgeois cities with taller buildings and new public spaces. Many former convents became public buildings, including museums, hospitals, offices and barracks. Others were demolished to make room for streets, squares and even multistory car parks. Still others became parishes or, through auctions, passed into private hands. Many old landmarks, mainly in Castile and Madrid, were demolished during or as a consequence of the liberal confiscations.

Organized as an intermunicipal company, the agency acts as the municipal archives for 67 municipalities in Buskerud, Telemark and Vestfold, as well as for Buskerud County Municipality and Telemark County Municipality. IKA Kongsberg is located at Frogs vei 48, in a complex situated next to the Regional State Archives in Kongsberg. This allows them to share a reading room and conservation facilities. IKA Kongsberg has capacity for 33 shelf- kilometers of material. History Irgensg√•rden 2 was the site of the archives until 2014 Traditionally the three countries had their state archives stored at the Regional State Archives in Oslo. During the 1980s it was decided that they would receive a separate institution, located in Kongsberg. This resulted in the opening of the Regional State Archives in Kongsberg in 1994. In the wake of this establishment, IKA Kongsberg was established in 1992 to serve an initial 14 municipalities. The catchment area grew gradually, with an average two municipalities a year joining. A new archives act was passed in 1999, which set new and significantly more stringent demands on the long-term municipal archival facilities. This included demands both for conservation, facilities, training, digitization and availability to the public. Traditionally most municipalities in Norway had kept their depot archives locally, often using non-professional staff to maintain the collections. The National Archival Services, who were given the task of monitoring the process, with a deadline for implementation set to 2012. Only the largest cities were deemed able to create their own archival institutions and the period saw an increase in the establishment of inter-municipal archival institutions. The new demands would give all municipalities a hike in their archival costs. IKA Kongsberg proposed the construction of a joint archives facility next to the Regional State Archives in Kongsberg, a project known as Arkivsenter √òstafjells. This facility would meet all the legal requirements. The joint location would allow the two archives to share conservation facilities and have a common reading room, allowing visitors to access municipal and state archives simultaneously. IKA Kongsberg argued that by locating both sites in Kongsberg, a larger and better archival professional environment could be established. Several municipalities came with counterproposals. Alternatives included locating the facility in Notodden, Porsgrunn and Tokke. A major cause of this debate was the price hike the new requirements would incur. The new facility opened on 24 March 2014.

They occur in bacteria, archaea, fungi, unicellular eukaryotic protists, slime molds, plants and animals. They vary in length, being as small as 350 residues and as large as 850 residues. The smaller proteins are generally of prokaryotic origin while the larger ones are of eukaryotic origin. Most of them possess twelve transmembrane Œ±-helical spanners but have a re-entrant loop involving TMSs 2 and 3. The APC Superfamily was established to encompass a wider range of homologues. Members of APC Family Members of one subfamily within the APC family (SGP; TC# 2.A.3.9) are amino acid receptors rather than transporters and are truncated at their C-termini, relative to the transporters, having 10 TMSs. The eukaryotic members of another subfamily (CAT; TC# 2.A.3.3) and the members of a prokaryotic subfamily (AGT; TC #2.A.3.11) have 14 TMSs. The larger eukaryotic and archaeal proteins possess N- and C-terminal hydrophilic extensions. Some animal proteins, for example, those in the LAT subfamily (TC# 2.A.3.8) including ASUR4 (gbY12716) and SPRM1 (gbL25068) associate with a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is essential for insertion or activity of the permease and forms a disulfide bridge with it. These glycoproteins include the CD98 heavy chain protein of Mus musculus (gbU25708) and the orthologous 4F2 cell surface antigen heavy chain of Homo sapiens (spP08195). The latter protein is required for the activity of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (2.A.3.8.5), which maintains cellular redox balance and cysteine/glutathione levels. They are members of the rBAT family of mammalian proteins (TC #8.A.9).

The stretch to be built between Milan and Verona will measure a total of around 165 kilometers. The route will pass through 31 municipalities in Lombardy and 4 in Veneto. Construction The project between Milan and Treviglio was approved in 1995. The connection between the Lambrate station in Milan and the station Pioltello-Limito was completed in 2000, while the section to Treviglio was opened on 10 June 2007. The line has a total of just under thirty kilometers long and has cost just under ‚Ç¨290 million. The final design of the stretch Treviglio - Brescia was approved by CIPE in November 2007 with funding from the Economic Financial Planning Document (DPEF) between 2007 and 2011 of ‚Ç¨2.05 billion. An agreement was signed between Rete Ferroviaria Italiana and Cepav Due to the start of work on the first construction lot of this on 7 March 2011, to the value of ‚Ç¨700 million. Work began in May 2012 and was completed in 2016. The railway signaling along the route of the line in operation is the same as on most of the conventional lines, while that of the under construction section will feature ERTMS/ETCS, which ensures interoperability between the European rail lines. Testing of the section Treviglio-Brescia has begun in August 2016. The route Leaving Milan Centrale station, the railway shares a common route with conventional tracks to Milan Lambrate station. After leaving Lambrate, it branches off east towards the mainline to Verona and Bergamo. At Melzo (near Pozzuolo station), the high-speed line divides from the historical route west of Treviglio station. This junction at Treviglio West will enable connection of the currently separate Treviglio and Treviglio Ovest stations. The dedicated high- speed section between Treviglio and Brescia is long. The project approved by the CIPE involves the construction of a new high-speed, high capacity railway that will bypass to the south of the city of Bergamo to reach Brescia along a line that is mostly separate from the conventional line.Article about the progress of building the line at October 2015 The new track will branch from the future junction at Treviglio West to follow the A35 motorway to the municipality of Castrezzato. From this location, at the completion of the railway line up to Verona, there will be a branch to Brescia West junction, joining with the conventional route. This junction will join the conventional line near Ospitaletto to arrive at the station of Brescia. Commercial operation of trains is scheduled for December 2016, at the start of the 2016-2017 timetable. Based on various projects, not yet approved by the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning, the stretch Castrezzato - Verona should be long and its cost has been estimated at ‚Ç¨2.8 billion. The section concerned starts from Brescia West junction, located near Castrezzato, and passed through the towns south of Brescia, following a route alongside the A21 motorway. At Montichiari a High-speed station for Brescia is planned and near Calcinato Brescia East junction is planned.

He was born in Chicago on June 16, 1954. His parents were from County Kerry, Ireland. Cahill began playing guitar at the age of nine and studied guitar at the Chicago Musical College. He was active in the Irish traditional music scene in Chicago in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1980s he and Irish fiddler Martin Hayes formed a band in Chicago called Midnight Court which combined traditional music with rock and roll. The band, in which Cahill played a Fender Telecaster and Hayes an electric fiddle, was active between 1989 and 1992. After its demise Cahill and Hayes continued to work together and formed an acoustic duo in 1996, developing an \\"unrushed, lyrical, highly expressive interpretation\\" of traditional Irish music. Cahill's chordal accompaniment uses standard tuning. In 1999 a New York Times reviewer described Hayes and Cahill's approach as \\"stripping old reels and jigs to their essence, leaving space between the notes for harmonics and whispered blue notes,\\" resulting in \\"a Celtic complement to Steve Reich's quartets or Miles Davis's Sketches of Spain. \\" Hayes and Cahill have toured extensively and released three recordings on the Green Linnet label: The Lonesome Touch (1997), Live in Seattle (1999), and Welcome Here Again (2008). Cahill and Hayes, along with singer Iarla √ì Lion√°ird, fiddler Caoimh√≠n √ì Raghallaigh and pianist Doveman, are the members of The Gloaming, an Irish-American supergroup whose first album was released in 2014, winning the Meteor Choice Music Prize for Irish album of the year.
