The brigade was formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 147th Infantry Brigade and was assigned to the 46th (West Riding and North Midland) Infantry Division. With the division, the brigade was sent overseas to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in April 1940 for training and labour duties. In May, the brigade fought against the German Army in the Battle of France until being evacuated at Dunkirk with the rest of the BEF. After spending the next two years in the United Kingdom on home defence against a German invasion, in July 1942 it was decided to convert the 137th Brigade into an armoured formation.

She is the author of L’Imaginaire carcéral de Jean Genet, a book on Jean Genet, a prominent, controversial French writer and later political activist. She was previously the Spokesperson for the African Union – United Nations hybrid peacekeeping mission in Darfur, UNAMID.  Early life and education  Elbasri was born in Casablanca, Morocco, and is a citizen of the United States. She received her early education in Casablanca and later earned her master's degree in the French Literature Department of l’ Université Hassan II. She moved to France in 1989 to pursue doctoral studies in the area of poetics of imagination. In 1996, she earned her PhD from l’Université de Savoie with a thesis on prison writings in Jean Genet’s novels, which she later extended into a book titled L’Imaginaire carcéral de Jean Genet. As part of her postdoctoral research, Elbasri was a member of Le Centre de Recherche Imaginaire et Création of l’Université de Savoie between 1996 and 1998, the year she left France for the United States. Elbasri also contributed articles to various newspapers and magazines in the US, UK, France and the Arab region.  United Nations career  Between 2000 and 2014, Elbasri held a range of press and communication posts at the United Nations, serving the world organization in Sudan, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, and New York Headquarters.  Blowing the whistle on the U.N.’s cover-up in Darfur  While posted in Darfur between 2012 and 2013 as the Spokesperson for UNAMID, the U.N.'s largest peacekeeping mission at the time, Elbasri witnessed what she claims was the U.N.’s deliberate and systematic cover-up of what may well amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. This includes the ethnic cleansing of the non-Arab populations and the systematic attacks against the peacekeepers by the Sudanese government forces, as well as the attacks on civilians by rebel factions. She resigned in protest and sought an internal investigation through different U.N. channels. As the U.N. declined to investigate, Elbasri decided to put the matter in the hands of the public. She leaked thousands of secret diplomatic cables, police reports, military investigations and emails to Foreign Policy magazine. The magazine ran a three-part series based on her disclosure that it considered as “the largest single leak of internal documents on an active U.N. mission in the world body's history.” 1 Elbasri describes her Darfur experience as an Orwellian one: “When I first set foot in Darfur on 16 August 2012 to serve as the spokesperson for UNAMID, little did I know that I had entered George Orwell’s world. The daily talk about peacekeeping, the protection of civilians and the peace process turned out to be a smokescreen that served to perpetuate crimes against humanity, protect war criminals and delay a meaningful peace agreement. I discovered a web of omissions, half-truths and lies that I had to reveal to the world, whatever the price.” In an unprecedented move, the International Criminal Court called on the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to investigate these grave accusations. Ban did not agree to an independent investigation, launching instead an internal review that Elbasri decried as “partial, biased and secretive.” The subsequent report found, however, five instances in which UNAMID stonewalled the media and withheld from U.N. Headquarters critical evidence indicating the culpability of Sudanese government forces in crimes against civilians and peacekeepers, keeping the Security Council in the dark. According to media reports, Britain, France and the US sought U.N. action against senior officials from UNAMID who failed to report crimes by Sudanese forces. However, the U.N. failed to hold the Mission leadership to account. Beyond her criticism of UNAMID, Elbasri decries that U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa and the Middle East are failing civilians, bolstering failed states and turning into what she calls “warkeeping operations.” Elbasri continues working to halt the withdrawal of UNAMID troops from Darfur; stop continued ethnic cleansing in the region; and encourage the international community to seek a new approach to peace in Darfur and other parts of Sudan.

The Uptown Theater was a movie theater designed by Wade B. Denham and built in 1928 in the Uptown neighborhood of Racine, Wisconsin. Operating history The building first opened on May 2, 1928, as a live theater, sponsored by businessman Ernst Klinkert., and known as the Majestic Theater. Its single stage with 1,292 seats was built on a hillside, using the natural slope of the land in its design. With The building included eight apartments, for actors to stay in during runs. The Majestic Theater closed in 1930, but it was converted into a cinema, and it reopened in 1940, now called the Uptown Theater. It closed once again in 1953, but reopened again the next year, before permanently closing at the end of 1959. History after closing After the Uptown Theater closed, its lobby was converted into retail space which became the Avenue Frame Shop. This store remained open for decades, but has recently closed. In 1981, a group called Preservation Racine set out to restore some of the city's former landmarks, including the Uptown, and in 1982, with their support, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The idea of restoring and reopening the theater was promoted by the non-profit Uptown Theater Group, which was formed in 2001. For Halloween in 2001, the Uptown Theater Group sponsored a haunted house attraction inside the abandoned theater. The haunted house was a fundraising event to promote awareness and support a renovation of the Uptown Theater. In 2002, the Uptown Theater Group planned to hold another haunted house fundraiser at the site, but could not obtain the proper permits from the city of Racine. As a last resort, the organizers rented out a banquet hall adjacent to the theater. Racine police found some of the party goers to be in possession of illegal drugs. Despite the Group's protests, renovation efforts effectively stopped after the incident. As of 2015, the Uptown Theater remains abandoned.

Web. 29 Mar. 2016. Commissioned into the New Zealand Rifles as a Second Lieutenant in 1924, Isherwood emigrated to the United Kingdom to train as a pilot in the Royal Air Force. Qualifying as a Pilot Officer in July 1930, he saw service in India and Britain before joining the staff of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath as a test pilot in the Armament Testing Section. Second World War In January 1941 Isherwood was posted to Fighter Command and was given command of a sector in No. 9 Group and later served as a controller at the group headquarters. In August 1941 Isherwood was selected to command No. 151 Wing, which was being formed for a mission codenamed Operation Benedict, which was planned in the aftermath of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The aim of Operation Benedict was to take two squadrons of Hawker Hurricane Mk IID fighters to defend the naval port of Murmansk in northern Russia and to train the Soviet Air Force to operate the aircraft, which would be the first of more than two thousand to be supplied.Carter, Eric and Loveless, Antony (2014) Force Benedict, Hodder & Stoughton (p. 69) Arriving on the first Arctic convoy at the beginning of September 1941, the wing established itself at an airfield at Vaenga (renamed Severomorsk in 1951). Besides training the Soviet pilots and ground crews, the wing claimed 15 enemy aircraft destroyed plus four \\"probables\\" and seven damaged, for the loss of one Hurricane in combat. None of the Soviet bombers that they escorted were lost.Carter pp. 213, 219 At the end of October, when the wing had handed their last aircraft to the Soviets, they were ordered by the Air Ministry in London to travel south by rail through the Soviet Union for further service in the Middle East theatre. Isherwood compiled a lengthy signal stating that the journey was likely to take three months, that no rations or winter clothing were available and that there was a considerable danger of being overrun by the advancing Germans. The order was rescinded and the wing was evacuated by sea.Carter pp. 217–221 He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service during the operation as well as the Order of Lenin.Carter pp. 250, 258 Returning to Britain, Isherwood took command of a series of air bases. He was intended to command No. 153 Wing, a much larger fighter force which was due to be sent to Russia in late 1942 but the plan, Operation Jupiter, was abandoned, perhaps because of the heavy losses to the Arctic convoys.Carter pp. 266–267 In 1944, he took command of No. 342 Wing in Burma.

The most famous version is an oil painting completed in 1914 and held by the National Gallery in Oslo since 1918. Sohlberg began to work on the subject in early 1900, after seeing the mountains of Rondane in bluish moonlight while skiing nearby in Easter 1899 or 1900. He moved in 1900 to a house on the Nesset at Atna in the Østerdalen valley in Eastern Norway. He was joined in 1901 by his wife Lilli Rachel Hennum; they remained at Atna until 1902, when they moved further north to Røros. He made several studies in the period 1900-02 in a variety of media, including charcoal, crayon, oil and watercolor. One study is held by the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. He began work on the oil painting held by the National Gallery in 1911, and completed the work in the winter of 1913-1914. It measures . Sohlberg later continued to use the image in other media, such as colour lithography. The work depicts mountains covered by snow, under a deep blue-black cloudless evening sky. The foreground is framed by the silhouetted limbs of bare weathered trees, but the work is devoid of any sign of humans or animals. At the centre of the symmetrical balanced painting is a single bright star visible in a gap between two mountains. Picked out on the snow of a mountain peak to the right is a cross.

He attended a primary school in Freienstein from 1908 to 1914 and a secondary school in Freienstein from 1914 to 1916. From 1916 to 1920 he attended a high school in Zurich. From 1920 to 1924 he studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (now ETH Zurich) under Professor Aurel Stodola. Career In 1924, Huber became Technical Director of the Bureau Technique Pescara where he supervised the design of nearly 30 different sizes and types of free-piston engine and acquired the nickname \\"Mr Free Piston\\". The first was the AC-2,http://www.freikolben.ch/media/DIR_117601/8f6d33385a507369ffff860d7f000101.jpg running on petrol (gasoline). The second was the AC-3, which was similar but ran on diesel fuel. Eighteen types of free-piston engine were built and tested. In 1932, Huber read a book by Professor Lomonosov about diesel locomotives. He also heard of a proposal by Petro Shelest for turbines driven by compressed air. This information gave him the idea of developing the free- piston gas turbine. Several of these were designed but not built. Finally, in 1938-39, the world's first free-piston generator was built. It used two G-30http://www.freikolben.ch/media/DIR_117601/8f6d33385a507369ffff860e7f000101.jpg machines and drove an 800 kW alternator.

Early life and background Beveridge was born 8 August 1848 in the town of Windsor, Colony of New South Wales. He was the son of John Beveridge, a baker and confectioner, and Jane Greig, who as assisted migrants had emigrated from Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, to Sydney on 16 January 1839. At the age of 19, Beveridge entered the mercantile firm of George Griffiths and Co. in 1867. On 8 August 1871 he was married to Priscilla Wright, the Anglo-Irish daughter of teacher and later principal of the Fort Street Training School John Wright (1822–1887), at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, by the Rev. Robert Lewers. Beveridge and his wife Priscilla had seven children: John Stuart (1872–1874), Percy (1875–1947), Mabel (1878–1955), Harry (1882–1943), Violet (1886–1975), Cecil (1888–1946) and Roy Stuart (1893–1916). In 1880 he was made a partner in the firm, and on the retirement of Griffiths became the owner, which specialised in \\"wholesale grocery and general merchandise\\" from its premises on the corner of Bridge and Young streets, Sydney. A prominent member of the flourishing business community in Sydney and Redfern, Beveridge became involved as a member of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and as a director of the Mortgage, Guarantee and Mercantile Finance Corporation of New South Wales, the Sydney Real Estate Bank and the Australian Traders' Fire Insurance Company. Beveridge also became a member of the Redfern Branch of the Free Trade Association. A keen sportsman, Beveridge was a member of the Cricket Union (vice-president in 1889) and was instrumental in the development of the Surry United Cricket Club, being captain from 1879 (now the Surry Hills Cricket Club). Public service Beveridge eventually stood for office as a free trader and became an alderman unopposed on Redfern Municipal Council for Belmore Ward on 20 September 1886, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Alderman Francis Augustus Wright, and was re-elected in February 1888. In September 1888 he presided over a meeting at Redfern Town Hall to support the ultimately-unsuccessful candidacy of free trader John Martin for a by-election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Redfern; the meeting was attended by Sir Henry Parkes who also spoke in support. Beveridge strongly aligned himself with the politics of Parkes and later stood for the seat of Redfern himself as a Free Trade candidate at the 1889 colonial election, but was unsuccessful, missing out by a margin of over 100 votes, despite the overall success of the Free Trade movement at that election, with Parkes forming government. Even so, on 12 June 1890 he was appointed to the Redfern Sub-District Public School Board by the Governor Lord Carrington, on the advice of Free Trader Minister for Public Instruction, Joseph Carruthers. On 12 February 1891 Beveridge was elected to be mayor of the council and was instrumental in making Redfern the first suburb in Sydney to have electricity and electric street lighting, which occurred when the Council voted unanimously in 1891, following the recommendations of the improvements committee, to build its own power station in Turner Street to power the suburb. Beveridge then proposed and passed through council a loan of £50,000 for the purpose. This movement by the council was later affirmed and protected by the Parliament of New South Wales when it passed the Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895. However, by May 1891 Beveridge had resigned as mayor and an alderman for Redfern prior to his candidacy for the 1891 election. His vacancy in Belmore Ward was subsequently filled by William Poole. Beveridge stood again as a Free Trade candidate for Redfern, reaffirming his support for the Free Trade vision for Australian Federation and noting that overall wages in New South Wales were higher compared to Victoria and taxation was lower owing to the Free Trade system in NSW, a system \\"that is best for the commercial interests of the colony.\\" Beveridge was however again unsuccessful at the June election which saw the Free Traders lose out to the Labor Party and the Protectionists. Later life Following this defeat, Beveridge returned to business, taking up a high-ranking position in the Sydney office of the New York Life Insurance Company. On 25 November 1891, Beveridge sold his merchandise business, George Griffiths and Co. to David Cohen and Company. Beveridge nevertheless retained his keen interest in the Free Trade movement and in politics generally, including presiding over the election committee for John Neild's unsuccessful bid for the seat of Woollahra at the 1894 election (he lost to Adrian Knox, standing as an 'Independent Free Trade' candidate). George Reid's Free traders were successful at that election and Beveridge, in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, noted: \\"the vote of last Tuesday must inspire every thinking man in the community with the idea that the people are ripe for the establishment of a progressive policy, and I believe Mr Reid is the man for the hour.\\" Lithgow By 1896, Beveridge had opened his own retail business in the rural and mining town of Lithgow and involved himself in various community activities, including in cricket. Reporting on his attendance at a Lithgow reception for Premier Reid in May 1896, the Windsor and Richmond Gazette noted: \\"no doubt, ere long Mr. [Beveridge] will take a leading part in matters connected with the welfare of the town, for he is too good a man to be allowed to stay long in clover. His ability is already recognised in his new home, and a matter of a few months will decide whether he enters the Municipal arena or not. If he does, Lithgow will be the gainer.\\" In early 1896 Beveridge nominated to take up a vacancy on Lithgow Ward on Lithgow Municipal Council, but received only 6 votes. The next year he stood again for Lithgow Ward but lost by one vote. Beveridge became heavily involved in local cricket circles, donating the \\"Beveridge Cup\\" for district matches, and becoming President of the Lithgow District Cricket Association in 1899; the patron of the association that year was prominent local politician Joseph Cook. A supporter of Australian Federation, Beveridge was nominated to attend the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst in November 1896, which had convened to discuss the 1891 draft Constitution being proposed for the Commonwealth of Australia. The most important recommendation made by the convention was that the Senate should be directly-elected. In December 1897, Beveridge established the Lithgow Land, Building, and Investment Company and became a company director. As a longstanding Justice of the Peace, on 23 January 1899 Beveridge was appointed by Governor Lord Hampden, on the recommendation of Minister for Justice Charles Lee, as Coroner for Lithgow and for the colony at large. Hay By 1901, Beveridge had moved again to the Riverina town of Hay, and opened his own general merchandise store, \\"Beveridge & Co.\\", in the town. It was not long before Beveridge again returned to Cricketing circles, gaining much respect in the Hay Cricket Association, later serving as vice-president, and rising to be President of the Hay Chamber of Commerce in 1901. In February 1901, Beveridge was elected as Honorary Secretary at the inaugural meeting of the Hay Free Trade Association and later assisting in the campaign of Free Trade candidate James Ashton for the seat of Riverina at the first federal election a month later. In May 1902 Beveridge departed Hay for a visit to London for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Return to Sydney After moving back to Sydney with his family, in later years he served as the general manager of the Merchants' and Traders' Employment Bureau, which his brother Peter had purchased in July 1908. The Bureau's offices were sited within the New York Mutual Life Building at 14 Martin Place, Sydney. Beveridge moved with his family to a new residence, \\"Violet\\" in Balfour Road, Kensington, but in later years his health suffered greatly owing to \\"acute heart trouble\\", which led to his death aged 67 on 15 March 1916. His youngest son Lance sergeant Roy Stuart Beveridge (20th Battalion) was later killed in action following the Battle of Flers in France on 12 November 1916.The battlefield conditions were so muddy that they were described by the official historian, Charles Bean, as \\"the worst ever encountered by the AIF\\". His eldest son Percy Beveridge became a notable cricketer in New Zealand, while his son Cecil became an actor and theatre director and, also of the 20th Battalion, was injured during the Battle of Pozières in 1916.Cecil Beveridge was injured later in September and was promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer Class One before receiving a medical discharge on 21 March 1920, he later worked for Hoyts Cinemas.

Origin of the family Baba Novak. Members of the family claim that the genealogical links between the medieval and modern branches of the family have been extensively researched, but scholars are more doubtful. The modern line of the Shishmanoğlu appears in the late 16th century with a legendary hajduk (brigand) Baba Novak, after a gap of over a century from the fall of Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of the Ottoman Turks. It was usual among Balkan notable of the time to assume medieval surnames and claim descent from the famous noble houses of their glorious past. The origin of the founder of the family can be traced to the village of Poreč (today Donji Milanovac, Serbia) on an island on the Danube. According to some scholars, the name Shishman is a Turkish translation of the nickname Debeljak (means Fat man) which Novak was known. Rebellion against the Turks Rostislav Stratimirovic. Novak was born in 1530s and in his early years studied at the monastery of Poreč. Afterward he began his career as a hajduk at an early age after he was imprisoned and beaten by Turks, that led him to leave his birthplace and take refuge in the forests of the Timok Valley where he quickly learned the use of weapons and military from a harambaš Hajduk. He soon formed his četa (band of hajduks) and started a violent fight against the Turks. His strong personality and military prowess made him a man of many followers and his guerrillas became a strong fighting force. He joined the forces of Michael the Brave in Banat with 2000 hajduks for the liberation of the Vlach lands and was made captain of the Brigands. In 1601 he was captured by the enemies of Prince Michael, sentenced to death and executed. After his death he is venerated as a hero Starina Novak in the Serb epic poetry and in Bulgarian and Romanian tales. According to the legend Novak had two sons Grujica and Sratsimir (Tatomir), who also fought with the Turks. The next important member of the family Shishmanoğlu was a son of Sratsimir Rostislav, who claimed the title Prince of Tarnovo and was a leader of Second Tarnovo Uprising. In 1686 he left for Russia, intending to gain support in the rebellion. At Moscow he met Russian Orthodox Patriarch Joachim and asked him for help. Upon the start of the Russo-Turkish War (1686–1700), the rebellion broke out prematurely in the old Bulgarian capital of Tarnovo. Rostislav returned to Ottoman Bulgaria, but the Ottoman forces were much greater and the rebellion was suppressed. After many adventures he went back to Moscow, where he finally married to the niece of the patriarch and gave the foundations of the Russian noble family Saveliev–Rostislavic. Establishment in Vidin Emmanuel Shishmanoğlu. In 1592 Grujica settled in the Bulgarian town of Vidin which in the Middle Ages was the residence of the Shishman Royal dynasty. His successors are engaged in tailoring, while the marriage of a one their girl with influential Bosnian janissar, give unexpected rise of the family. In 1794 their grandson Osman Pazvantoğlu became governor of the Vidin district and a rebel against Ottoman rule. When Osman runs, he delegated his financial affairs of his cousin Emmanuel Shishmanoğlu, who accumulate great wealth. Emmanuel developed a finance house by installing each of his four sons in the main economic centres in Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Unlike the Christian usurers of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed Turkish noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the system created by the Shishmanoğlu was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. The skills of Emmanuel allowed them to insulate their property from local violence. They managed to maintain their privileges after the death of Pazvantoğlu and even they are given the title Çorbacı. In 1850, however, the sons of Emmanuel support a large uprising in Vidin, because they hope to restore autonomy to the district and to become its princes. Punishment were expelled from the town and their business is destroyed. Political success Prof. Ivan Shishmanov. After the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule, the family enter into the political life of the country. The son of Emmanuel, Alexander Shishmanov was elected to mayor of the town of Svishtov. Other family members are politics and diplomats too. Of these the most famous is Dr. Assen Shishmanov and Prof. Ivan Shishmanov. In 1884 Ivan Shishmanov went abroad to study, attending over the years the universities of Jena, Geneva, and Leipzig. He became a professor at the University of Sofia in 1894. From 1903 to 1907 he served as Bulgaria’s minister of education. Shishmanov was the first Bulgarian scholar to study literature from the point of view of culture and social history. He did considerable research on writers and cultural figures of the Bulgarian national renaissance of the period 1750 to 1878. His works include writings on Bulgaria’s literary ties with Russia and the Ukraine and a series of lectures on comparative Western European literatures in the 18th century. Dimiter Shishmanov, the son of Ivan Shishmanov also involved in politics and became Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Second World War. As a minister he supported Bulgaria's entry into Tripartite Pact and after the war was executed by the communists.

The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party gained overall control of the council. Background These took place at the height of the unpopularity of the Labour Government. In Hammersmith from 52 Labour, 7 Conservative and 1 Liberal councillors at the commencement of the election the Conservatives, masterminded by John Putnam and Seton Forbes-Cockell (both of whom were elected Aldermen, won in every ward except White City, with two sitting Labour Councillors in Margravine and one in Sherbrooke elected in split votes. It is generally accepted that the Conservative Party in Hammersmith have never had as talented a group as in 1968. Of the newly elected councillors David Ashby and Patrick Ground went on to Parliament, Ben Patterson to the European Parliament, Christopher Horne fought and lost twice. Jack Rose, a popular local GP, was for many years the Chairman of the British branch of Gamblers Anonymous. The business experience of Stuart Leishman, Kim Howe, John Akerman, Paul Dwyer, Peter Fane and Sir George Bull, together with the above mentioned Aldermen led to a business renaissance in the borough, which was cut short by Ted Heath's appalling unpopularity in 1971, and the excellent organisation of Labour agent Leslie Hilliard CBE, which led to all but two - one of whom Reg Simmerson promptly resigned for the party - being defeated. Sir Samuel Salmon, the Chairman of J Lyons and Co , then a major local employer, Seton Forbes-Cockell and Gordon Field - the later after an abrasive and divisive election - served as Mayors from 1968-1971; William Smith and John Putman subsequently returned to the Council and were also elected Mayors. Others were not so successful; bankrupt builder John Duff disappeared within months of the election; ILEA representative Simon de Voghelaere faced similar financial trouble, and Nick Bryce-Smith subsequently became involved in the Bradstock Insurance scandal. In April 1987 Joan Caruana, Mayor of Hammersmith, hosted a gathering attended by 44 former members, officers and others connected with the 1968-71 council; it was the last public appearance of Lord Stewart of Fulham.

Importations that year were $500,000 per annum, and manufactures $300,000 per annum. First floor tenants of the Sutter Street building included W.K. Vanderslice & Co. silversmiths who were well-known San Francisco producers of fine quality sterling silver flatware and hollow ware out of this facility starting approximately 1873.

Effects of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire on Levison Brothers operations The business was prospering when in 1906 the San Francisco earthquake and fire made a total loss of the original Levison-built and owned building at 132, 134, and 136 Sutter Street (see artist's rendition at right). The only remains were the diamonds and jewelry stored in a very large safe, which fell three floors through the burning building and buried itself in the basement floor, wedged between some steel girders it had pulled down with it.Interview 4/27/1977, Mr. Fritz Barkan, Former Levison Brothers employee. Transcript at http://contentdm.marinlibrary.org/cdm/ref/collection/ohp/id/196 It was badly burned in the fire, and was allowed to cool off for two weeks before anyone could touch it. After an intense digging effort, a pit was opened up around the safe so that the safe door could be opened. The excitement was high. The inner doors of the safe had held tight, and they found the main contents unharmed. The Levisons quickly stashed away the contents for temporary hiding, transporting the contents across San Francisco Bay via boat (this is the pre- bridge era) to a family residence on Beach Road, Belvedere Island, California and another location in Mill Valley, California. That 19th century Victorian residence on Belvedere Island still exists to this day as a historic property.

It is a nonprofit member association, serving as a professional and learned society for scholars and researchers involved in the field of religious education. It has several hundred members, most of whom are from North America, with a scattering of members worldwide. REA members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, church educators, curriculum developers, judicatory executives, seminarians, graduate students, and interested lay-people. REA members come from multiple faith traditions, and no tradition, and study a very diverse array of religious traditions. The REA's leaders (presidents and executive secretaries) are drawn from a distinguished list of educators. History The REA was founded in 1903 by William Rainey Harper, the first president of the University of Chicago, with the support of the Council of Seventy, a learned society of biblical scholars.\\"Form new organization for religious education,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 20, 1903, p. 6 The keynote speaker at its first convention was John Dewey. In its early years the Association was organized into several groups: Council of religious education, Universities and colleges, Theological seminaries, Churches and pastors, Sunday schools, Secondary public schools, Elementary public schools, Private schools, Teacher- training, Christian associations, Young people’s societies, the Home, Libraries, the Press, Correspondence instructions, Summer assemblies, Religious art, and Music.\\"The Religious Education Association,\\" in The Biblical World, Vol. 25, No. 1, p. 70-72, Jan. 1905 In 1906 the Association began to publish the journal Religious Education under the editorship of Henry Cope. In 1953 the Association marked its 50th anniversary with a three-day meeting at the University of Pittsburgh that brought together more than 2500 Christian and Jewish educators from the US and Canada.\\"Church educators to mark 50th year,\\" New York Times, 31 October 1953, p. 9 In 1973 the Association began awarding the William Harper Rainey award to distinguished educators. In 1975, the Association held a major national colloquy on civil religion at which scholars Robert Bellah, Vine DeLoria, Jr., and Michael Novak spoke.\\"Educators weigh a 'civil religion,'\\" New York Times, 27 November 1975, p. 38 In 1992 the Association began awarding the Herman E. Wornom award to distinguished institutions. In 2003 the REA merged with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education (which was formed in 1970 from an earlier section of the National Council of Churches). Yale University holds the archives of the Religious Education Association and its predecessor bodies. Publications The REA has published the scholarly journal Religious Education continuously since 1906 (archives of which are available electronically at Taylor & Francis). This journal has consistently published work by scholars from multiple continents, diverse faith traditions, and various educational settings, and maintains a high level of citation in various ranking systems. In 2014 the REA began publishing a scholarly monograph series entitled Horizons in Religious Education jointly with Wipf & Stock. The REA also publishes a quarterly newsletter, eREACH, which began as the “religious education association clearing house,” and which serves to network, resource, and connect the association members. Annual meeting The REA hosts an annual meeting, usually in early November. Meeting presentations occur in four formats: research interest group (a formal scholarly paper), colloquy (a collaborative session engaging ideas in progress), workshop (a hands on session oriented towards specific skills), and poster (a typical scholarly poster presentation). The association has a long history of commitment to collegiality, innovative learning design, and support for students. In addition, the REA is a “related scholarly organization” to the American Academy of Religion, and hosts one session each year at the AAR annual meeting.

It is based on the 1877 novel Black Beauty by Anna Sewell.  Plot  Holly, Bertie's sister, gets a wonderful exciting birthday surprise when Mr. John Manley has a black horse with him. Squire Douglas Gordon, Polly and Bertie's father, wishes his daughter a happy birthday and allows her to keep the horse, which she names \\"Black Beauty\\". In the barn, Filcher is offered some jobs to do. By the time John and Black Beauty arrive at Black Beauty's new horse barn, two horses, Merrylegs and Ginger catch sight of him. Suddenly, Filcher is woken up by John and told to clean out the horse stall. As soon as John leaves, Flicher picks up John's pocket watch and examines it. John soon returns, looking for his watch which he forgot in the barn. Black Beauty finds John's pocket watch hidden in Filcher's pocket and brings it out, surprising Filcher. John retrieves it and leaves the barn. Black Beauty and Merrylegs are all worried by Ginger's story about people who use whips for horse cruelty. Merrylegs tells his story about when he was made to pull carts around a dirty factory with choking smoke. Ginger tries to tell them that all humans are cruel. But Merrylegs tells them John, Squire Gordon, Bertie and Polly are not cruel. Squire Gordon and John go out for an adventure with Black Beauty along the countryside on a nice day. A thunderstorm occurs, and lightning strikes a tree, making it fall into the river. As John, Squire Gordon and Black Beauty arrive at the bridge, the river rises, making it look dangerous for the bridge. A man warns them that a big storm is on the way. Black Beauty refuses to cross the bridge. At last, with two final shakes from John's reins, Black Beauty crosses the bridge safely. Underneath the bridge, the parts of the tree catch the wood that holds the bridge, making it collapse. During the night, They come across the bridge again, which is in danger of collapsing because of the surging river. As they near the bridge again, Black Beauty rears up once again and whinnies. John is warned not to cross the bridge, as it's in danger of collapsing. John crosses anyway, but the bridge falls to pieces and John falls into the surging river. Squire Gordon throws Black Beauty's reins down to Manley, and he is pulled up in time to watch the remains of the wood float away in the surging river. Squire Gordon is relieved that Black Beauty saved John's life. In the night, Black Beauty smells a burning smell and Merrylegs tells them it's coming from the bags. Soon, Raffles, the dog, smells the smoke as well and starts to bark, alerting Squire Gordon and the townsfolk. John then rings the bell to alert all of the people that the barn is on fire. Gordon orders the men to fetch buckets of water to put the flames out. John climbs into the burning barn to rescue the horses. In the barn, John gets Black Beauty to use his hooves to break the barn door down. The door is broken open and the horses are free from the fire. As soon as the fire cools, John tells Filcher that he left his pipe in the stables making the hay burn. As a result, Filcher is banished from working in the stables due to his carelessness in leaving his pipe, making it catch fire and burning the barn roof down. Gordon is called by Bertie to come quickly and is horrified to find his daughter has fainted. She is taken into bed by Mrs Bates. The next morning, Holly is in bed as Mrs Bates tries to make her better. Gordon tells John that his daughter has a high fever. So John goes off to fetch Dr. White by taking Black Beauty. The doctor finds John and is told that Polly has fallen ill and is asked to come as quickly as possible. With the doctor on board, Black Beauty gallops away to Polly. Bertie is told by his father to look after Black Beauty. Unfortunately, Bertie leaves Black Beauty uncovered when he has to see how Polly is doing. Soon, the storm comes again and the rain pours down, leaving Black Beauty feeling cold without his blanket. Next morning, Holly wants to see Beauty but sees that he is still fast asleep. Polly is mad at her brother and tells Bertie that she will never forgive him if Beauty dies. But Beauty opens his eyes and struggles to get up. The children are pleased to see that Beauty is finally awake. So Gordon takes Polly back to bed if she wants to get better quicker. But behind Beauty's stable, Filcher overhears that Beauty will get his strength back, and decides to kidnap Black Beauty. Later, they are in the woods searching for clues about Black Beauty. Raffles leads them to Filcher's old windmill home in the fields. They see Filcher and Beauty, and try and think of a way to get Black Beauty back without Filcher knowing or getting spotted by him. But Raffles wobbles the bench accidentally tipping over Bertie and Polly onto the ground. Filcher hears the noise and grabs the children. They struggle until he threatens to beat Beauty. When they finally give in, they are both locked in a cupboard as Filcher takes Black Beauty to the pits. Back at the old windmill, Holly and Bertie encounter some rats. Luckily, Raffles has brought John, Squire Gordon, Merrylegs and Ginger to the rescue. Squire Gordon breaks down the door while Raffles and John try to scare the rats away. After the children are free, the children try to persuade their father that Raffles and Merrylegs know where Black Beauty is taken to. In the end, their father tells Bertie to lead the way. At the pits, Filcher's boss Mr. Skinner begins to put Black Beauty to work by making him pull a wagon filled with coal, whipping him as he does so. Luckily, John and the others show up and get into a fight with Skinner, which results in falling to his death. John takes Filcher and Squire Gordon tells him that the constable will deal with him. Back in the fields, everyone is happy as Beauty has been. Then Beauty gallops over to Holly, who cuddles Beauty.

It serves as the headquarters of the Guatemala Institute of Tourism, the Antigua Tourism Association, National Police and the Sacatepquez Department government.  History  In the southeast corner of the Central Plaza, is located the first two-story building constructed in 1558. Made with a wooden floor and arches that support the whole structure. The General Captaincy of Guatemala was governed from this building , and inside it all the government, administrative and military offices worked there. The General Captain's, life was full of luxuries for himself, his family and friends. Construction of the Captain General residence and the Real Audiencia member began in 1558. The building also lodged the Royal Tax office, jail, Army headquarters, horse facilities and warehouses. By 1678, the Captain General Palace was already a two-story building, with a wooden main entrance and columns.  San Miguel earthquakes  The San Miguel earthquake severely impacted the city of Santiago de los Caballeros; the Royal Palace suffered some damage in rooms and walls. This earthquake made the authorities think about moving the city to a new location less vulnerable to earthquakes, but the city inhabitants strongly opposed this measure and they even went as far as to invade the Palace to make their point. The city did not move, but a considerable number of troops were needed to restore calm. Diego de Porres, city master building fixed the Palace damage and finished by 1720; although he made some more improvements that lasted until 1736.  San Casimiro earthquake  The San Casimiro earthquakes that stroke the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala in 1751 damaged the palace again. Its façade and levels were destroyed, but the remaining basis permitted its rebuilt, in 1755, finishing it in 1764. But the nature stroke again, when an earthquake in 1773 shook the city. An intended for transferring the building's columns was made when the city moved into the Ermita Valley, but it wasn't possible because they were too heavy.  Santa Marta earthquake  North view of the Captain Generals Palace and the makeshift warehouses where its stone pillars were stored after the Santa Marta earthquake. Image from the 1840s.

Cathedral and what is left of the Palace in an image from 1884. On July 29, 1773, day of Saint Martha of Bethania, a very powerful earthquake hit the city of Santiago de los Caballeros at around 3:00 p.m. One hour later, an even more devastating tremor that lasted for about a minute hit the city again, in the middle of a strong thunderstorm, destroying churches, government office buildings and private homes. It also broke water and food supply chains, as the natives that provided the city fled to the mountains. On August 2 and 4, captain general Martín de Mayorga presided over the \\"General Meetings\\" with the local authorities, including archbishop Pedro Cortés y Larraz, criollo City Hall members, and regular clergy representatives. They concluded to inform king Carlos III and the Indian Council about the destruction and the eventual move of the city to neighbor \\"La Ermita\\" valley, which was not as close to the volcanoes, which were considered the culprit for the destruction of the city at the time. On December 13, 1773 two strong earthquakes hit the area again, resting the case of the group that wanted to move to a different location. Once 1774 the Indian Council pronounced its verdict on the city status and approved the move to \\"La Ermita\\" valley. Matías de Gálvez, between 1779 and 1783, was in charge of coordinating the move. Possibly the damage caused by the earthquake itself was serious, but not as destructive as the one caused by the city abandonment. On January 16, 1775 master builder Bernardo Ramirez start pulling out all reusable construction material from the destroyed buildings to move it to the new capital city, because of a legal order to do so. After this, the Palace was left without doors, windows, balconies, ornaments, and so on.  After the capital moved to La Ermita  Royal Palace in 1875. Palace after its façade was rebuilt. Image from 1896. Palace and Central Square in 1920. The city remained relatively abandoned during the 19th century, and as such, the Guatemala archbishop sold what was left of monasteries and churches to regular citizens. Some families went back to Antigua to settle there once again, so eventually there had to be some sort of authority that was established in the city and used some of the old buildings to work. Towards the end of the 19th century the old Palace façade was rebuilt, using the stone columns that had been for almost a hundred year in makeshift warehouses in front of the Palace, on the south section of Central Square. After this work, the less damaged sections were reopened: the jail and the government offices. On February 4, 1976 Guatemala was struck again by a powerful earthquake of 7.5 in the Richter scale, which destroyed most of country infrastructure and severely damaged the Palace. Its eastern façade had to be demolished. The Palace, along with the rest of Antigua Guatemala was declared monument of humanity by UNESCO in 1979.

Kim is portrayed by Rhea Seehorn, and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. A lawyer, she is the confidant and love interest of Jimmy McGill, whom she later marries.  Conception and development  In writing the pilot for Better Call Saul, showrunners Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould had included the character of Kim but as she was a fresh character to the Breaking Bad story compared to Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman or Mike Ehrmantraut, they had not yet established any plan for her. Gilligan say they had written Kim as \\"perhaps a love interest past tense, or potential love interest future tense\\", and possibly waning out of Jimmy's life later, and originally a \\"tempering influence\\" for Jimmy, but had no idea where else they would take her character. Rhea Seehorn auditioned and got the role in April 2014, about two months before the pilot was shot. According to casting director Sharon Bialy, they had used two fake scenes to keep the high- profile project a secret, and when Seehorn auditioned and impressed them with both scenes, only then did they go to the next step and explain the audition's true purpose. Seehorn was able to adapt to this change to the role of Kim in a single take. Hero\\", after Jimmy defends himself to Howard, led Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould to significantly increase her role. The pilot had two scenes with Kim, one which involves her counseling Jimmy after Howard Hamlin chews him out. The scene as written had minimal direction, but Seehorn, in preparing for the shot, saw a number of subtleties with the scene that suggested she knew Jimmy intimately, that she had boundaries, and she was used to cleaning up after Jimmy's mistakes. She also felt from this scene that Kim would prefer to listen before speaking and using that as a position of power. The writers saw how Seehorn acted out the scene and realized how much more it defined the character going forward, someone that prioritized work and placed boundaries on her relationship with Jimmy but still cared for him. Gilligan considered Seehorn's ongoing performance as Kim essential to her development. Seehorn had already gotten an idea that Kim enjoyed participating on Jimmy's cons, a fact established in the screenplay for the fourth episode of the first season \\"Hero\\", but which Seehorn had yet to see. Seehorn was able to use very subtle smiles to indicate Kim's appreciation for Jimmy during that episode, which Gould said, \\"The way she played it just felt so right that it gave us a strong feeling for where we were going with her.\\" With this change, the writers saw Kim no longer being as moral as planned and gave her a darker side that arose from her childhood, something that gave her a chip on her shoulder that would make her give in to more unethical approaches if it got the job done, and thus one that readily fell into work alongside Jimmy in his cons after fighting her reluctant nature to join in. Gould called this \\"The emotional connection between these two characters had a gravitational pull that started twisting the whole story around.\\" This also drastically altered the direction they took Jimmy's transformation into Saul. The first-season finale, \\"Marco\\" shows Jimmy walking away from a potential job with the law firm Davis & Main that Kim had set up for him. Season two was to continue with Jimmy outright forgoing the job, but because the writers wanted to include Kim more based on Seehorn's performance, they altered this to show Jimmy returning and accepting the job for Kim's sake. During the first two seasons, Kim was rarely seen without a business suit or a tight ponytail, a choice made between Seehorn, Gilligan, Gould and stylist Trish Almeida to show that Kim was \\"all business\\". In the third season, Kim gets into a car accident, breaking her arm which in actuality would make it difficult for Kim to put up her hair in a ponytail without significant effort. At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unravelled, Almeida and Seehorn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if it was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry. Gilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \\"impending tragedy\\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \\"self- destructive behavior\\". Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \\"Wexler v. Goodman\\".  Character biography   Background  Born in 1968 (according to her driver's license in \\"JMM\\"), Kim was raised in several Nebraska towns, including Red Cloud, but is intentionally vague about her past. In a flashback in \\"Wexler v. Goodman\\", Kim is shown to have become self- reliant as a teenager due to her mother's alcoholism. In \\"The Guy for This\\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners. Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his con artist past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate. After attaining admission to the bar, Kim quickly became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney. With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate. During the period leading up to the events of Better Call Saul, Kim and Jimmy are shown to have developed a close personal relationship, which eventually turns romantic.  Season 1  In the show's present (2002), Jimmy is angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, He has run- ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to temporarily lose her standing within HHM. Reduced to entry-level document review work, she becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case. When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M.;  Season 2  Jimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento. Jimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to become plaintiffs, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients. Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more plaintiffs, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M; superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further. Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore Kim's stature, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own. Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel. Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit. Reduced to meaningless work such as arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely (S&C;). Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark. She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses. Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM. Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf. Inconsistencies in the documents at a state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question. Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage. Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.  Season 3  Chuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested. Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity as a psychosomatic illness discredits his testimony. Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred. Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm. To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery. Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.  Season 4  Following Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood. Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death. Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor. Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking pro bono criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her pro bono work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases. With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license. By 2004, Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard. Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown. They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning, planning, and building permit approval processes. After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death. He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \\"S'all good, man!\\" and gives her his trademark finger gun gesture as he walks off.  Season 5  Jimmy tells Kim that his \\"Saul Goodman\\" alias gives him a ready-made client base for a criminal law practice. Kim continues balancing her workload between pro bono criminal defense work and Mesa Verde business. When Jimmy suggests Kim use a con to convince a pro bono client to accept a plea bargain, she initially asks him to leave her alone but later finds herself using the con on the client, and feels ashamed about it later. She asks Jimmy to keep his distance from her work, which he agrees to do. Later, Mesa Verde asks Kim to help deal with Everett Acker, an elderly man who refuses to leave his home on land leased from the bank to make way for the bank's planned call center. Acker refuses the bank's attempts at a settlement and Kim finds sympathy for him. When she cannot convince the bank to change its plans, she asks Jimmy to represent Acker and draw out the case. They find potential blackmail information on the bank's president, but Kim decides not to use it. Rich Schweikart suggests that Kim disengage from Mesa Verde business because her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses. Kim offers Jimmy a $75,000 settlement for Acker, promising to personally pay the difference between that figure and what Kevin Wachtell, Mesa Verde's president, agrees to. Jimmy agrees, but at the meeting to finalize the settlement, he makes use of the blackmail information Kim refused to use and Kevin's high regard for his father to coerce Kevin into a settlement more favorable to Acker. Kim tells Jimmy she is upset that he made her the \\"sucker\\" for his con and says that because of the lack of trust they either need to separate or get married so they can enjoy spousal privilege. Jimmy and Kim marry in a simple courthouse ceremony. Kim finds that Kevin is still willing to have Kim as Mesa Verde's outside counsel despite Jimmy's representation of Acker. Jimmy is asked to represent Lalo Salamanca, a member of the Mexican cartel who was arrested under an alias for murder. Jimmy tells Kim as a test their new relationship, and she is appreciative of his honesty as well as his intent to not fight for Lalo's release on bail. Gus Fring desires Lalo's release and arranges for Mike Ehrmantraut to provide Jimmy information he uses to persuade a judge to grant bail, which the judge sets at $7 million cash. Lalo convinces Jimmy to collect the money from a remote location, paying him $100,000 for the job. Kim warns Jimmy not to be a bagman for the cartel, but Jimmy accepts the job anyway, believing it is a simple errand. While returning with the money, Jimmy is attacked by gunmen. Mike was tracking Jimmy for Gus, and he kills all but one of the attackers. Jimmy's car breaks down and they push it over the side of the road and continue a two-day trek across the desert with the money. On the second day they kill the remaining attacker, reach a truck stop, and contact Gus for help. When Jimmy does not return as scheduled, Kim pretends to be Lalo's lawyer, visits him in jail, and asks for Jimmy's location. Lalo refuses to tell her and says that Jimmy will be fine because he is a survivor. Jimmy posts the bail and meets Lalo after his release. As Jimmy and Mike agreed, Jimmy says his car broke down and he walked alone cross-country so he would not risk losing the money. Lalo accepts this and prepares to leave for Mexico the next day. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she realizes he is lying after she sees that he saved his coffee mug, which has a bullet hole. Kim tells Jimmy she will be ready to hear the truth whenever he is ready to reveal it. She stays home the next day to tend to Jimmy's wounds and help him cope with the trauma, but Jimmy opts to go to the courthouse for work instead. Kim returns to S&C;, but her mind wanders, and she decides to quit on the spot, leaving Mesa Verde with S&C; but taking her pro bono cases. That evening, Jimmy and Kim argue about her decision to quit. Mike calls to warn them about Lalo, who searched for Jimmy's car instead of returning to Mexico. When Lalo arrives at Kim's apartment, he asks Jimmy to repeat the story of his desert trek several times, then reveals that he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that the car was probably shot at by passersby for fun, and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and leaves. Kim and Jimmy go to a hotel so Lalo will not find them if he returns. Jimmy tells Kim the truth of what happened in the desert and wonders out loud if being with him is bad for her, which she denies. The next day, Kim goes to the courthouse to acquire more pro bono cases from the public defender. She runs into Howard and tells him she quit S&C.; Howard assumes Jimmy is responsible and tells her about Jimmy's recent harassment campaign against him. Kim laughs, says she's capable of making her own decisions, and tells Howard he does not understand Jimmy. Howard angrily replies that Chuck was the one who best understood Jimmy. In the hotel room that night, Kim tells Jimmy about her conversation with Howard and in her anger suggests continuing the harassment campaign Jimmy started. As the night continues, Kim's suggestions get more serious, and she suggests they derail Howard's career to force a resolution of the Sandpiper case, which will enable Jimmy to collect his seven-figure share of the settlement sooner. Jimmy advises against it and asks Kim if she is sure she wants to follow through, so Kim repeats his finger gun gesture as a sign she is confident about proceeding against Howard.  Ethics Training with Kim Wexler  AMC released ten mini-episodes of Ethics Training with Kim Wexler alongside the fifth season of Better Call Saul, which were presented on both YouTube and AMC's social media sites. This series follows similar series Los Pollos Hermanos Employee Training w/ Gus Fring for season three and Madrigal Electromotive Security Training presented by Mike Ehrmantraut for the fourth season. The ethics training videos are presented as continuing education videos mixing live-action segments of Kim, with Jimmy filming her \\"behind the scenes\\" along with animated segments, and are a product of \\"Saul Goodman Productions\\". The animated segments include nods to both Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad.  Reception  Rhea Seehorn portrays Kim Wexler. Due to Kim Wexler's popularity in Better Call Saul, creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \\"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\\". Salon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season, saying: \\"But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4. With her signature ponytail, her sensible bargain-rack suit separates and heels that are low enough to polish her look but high enough to suggest a whiff of danger, Kim is a stand-in for every cubicle dweller who takes pride in working hard and doing a job well but at some point realizes that it’s not doing enough.\\" For her performances in season 1 and season 2, Rhea Seehorn won a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2015 and 2016. Rhea Seehorn's performance as Kim during the fifth season was highly praised, particularly for the final scene from \\"Bad Choice Road\\" in which she stood up to Lalo for Jimmy, and her portrayal of a Kim who might be \\"breaking bad\\" herself in her last scene in \\"Something Unforgivable\\". CNN's Brian Lowry said \\"This has, in essence, really been Seehorn's year, crystallizing what has drawn Kim to Jimmy, and his mounting fears that his activities were endangering her.\\" Several critics felt that Seehorn was a significant Emmy snub at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards. Brian Tallerico of Rolling Stone referred to Seehorn's work as \\"one of the best performances on any show in the last decade\\" and Liz Shannon Miller of Collider wrote, \\"Seehorn in particular hurts after turning in career-best work; Kim Wexler's journey in Season 5 was a heartbreaking, even chilling experience\\".

He is portrayed by Michael Mando and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. Nacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the Salamanca drug organization. He cares deeply for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, Manuel. He befriends Jimmy McGill after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill Hector Salamanca, the family patriarch, by switching his medication, but this is discovered by Gus Fring, who runs the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas, which is further complicated when the cartel sends the shrewd Lalo Salamanca to oversee operations.  Concept and development  Michael Mando said that he had been approached through his agent from Better Call Saul casting directors about being in the show. After sending in an audition tape, he was flown to Los Angeles to meet with showrunners Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould and perform a screen test. For Mando, he said it was \\"love at first sight\\" in working with the pair in how well they provided direction and feedback, and was notified about getting the part a few weeks later. The character was first mentioned in the Breaking Bad episode \\"Better Call Saul\\". To prepare for Nacho, Mando spent time watching crime and criminology documentaries to understand the motivations of criminals, as well as catching up on the whole of Breaking Bad, which he had not yet watched in its entirety before. Mando considered Nacho to be \\"extremely intelligent and patient\\" and would be a character that would have growth over the course of the show. Mando said that the showrunners gave little direction to the character, and instead \\"They wanted to see what I would bring to the character\\", allowing him to develop Nacho himself. For part of that, he explored elements of Mayan and Aztec cultures to bring to the character. He also brought some of the superficial traits of his Orphan Black character Vic Schmidt into Nacho. Mando said that initially Nacho was going to have a larger role with Jimmy in the first season, being the season's \\"big bad\\", but as Gilligan and Gould wrote out the season, they made the character of Chuck McGill more of an antagonist for Jimmy, and so Nacho was placed on a slower path to be developed in later seasons. Mando said he felt this helped fit Nacho's character, waiting patiently for the right opportunity to make a move to get ahead.  Character biography  Michael Mando portrays Nacho Varga in Better Call Saul Little is known of Nacho's background before the events of Better Call Saul. While he spends some of his time helping his father Manuel with his upholstery business, most of Nacho's time is assisting in the Salamanca family's drug ring, which he does not speak of to his father.  Better Call Saul  = Season 1 = While attempting to represent Betsy and Craig Kettleman, a couple accused of embezzling $1.6 million, Jimmy McGill has a run-in with Tuco Salamanca. Tuco has Nacho and other associates drag Jimmy to the desert to kill him. Nacho believes Jimmy's plea that he is a lawyer and convinces Tuco that killing an attorney would result in police scrutiny of the Salamanca family's drug business, so Tuco lets Jimmy go. Nacho approaches Jimmy about stealing the money from the Kettlemans, but Jimmy refuses. He warns the Kettlemans, who disappear from their home. Nacho is the prime suspect and is arrested. He coerces Jimmy into helping clear his name and Jimmy locates the Kettlemans, which leads to Nacho's release. Nacho engages in a side deal with Daniel Wormald, who wants to sell pills stolen from the pharmaceutical company where he works. Daniel brings Mike Ehrmantraut as a bodyguard. When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists he pay the full amount. As Daniel and Mike leave, Mike explains that he knew Nacho was conducting the transaction without the Salamancas' knowledge and so had an incentive to make sure the deal went smoothly. = Season 2 = Daniel uses his drug money to buy a flashy Hummer. Mike refuses to participate in the next deal, so Daniel goes alone. Nacho takes the opportunity to learn Daniel's name and address. He later breaks into Daniel's house and steals the money back, along with a valuable collection of baseball cards. Daniel reports the collection's theft to the police, who discover an empty hiding place where Daniel hid the stolen drugs. Mike realizes his involvement will be uncovered if police continue to investigate, so he convinces Nacho to give Daniel the cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer. Nacho is impressed by Mike's candor and coolness under pressure. As Tuco becomes increasingly volatile, potentially exposing the Salamanca organization, and the likelihood of his learning about Nacho's secret deals increases, Nacho decides to eliminate Tuco and tries to hire Mike to kill him. Mike instead arranges a scenario where Tuco attacks him in view of police, leading to Tuco's arrest and conviction. Hector Salamanca has Nacho take Tuco's place in the organization. Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations. He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the hidden in one of the tires. Nacho tells Mike that Hector covered up the hijacking by killing the Good Samaritan who stopped to aid the driver. = Season 3 = Mike's actions lead to Hector looking for other routes to smuggle drugs, and he considers using Manuel's upholstery shop. Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind. In pleading with his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen placebo in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack. Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death will not be obvious. Nacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him. Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with Gus Fring, Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious. Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose. Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication. Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing. = Season 4 = Bolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized. Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand. Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag. Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus's orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas. Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, and shooting Nacho. Nacho succeeds at calling Leonel and Marco Salamanca (the Cousins) for help. They burn the car and take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving Nacho's life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang. Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas to Leonel and Marco as the ones who attacked him. They attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \\"stolen\\" drugs. Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan. Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas. After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father. Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did. = Season 5 = Lalo's investigation into Gus's activities forces Gus to temporarily halt construction of his planned underground methamphetamine superlab. Gus threatens harm to Manuel to coerce Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho tries to convince Manuel to move away, but Manuel refuses to leave. When one of the Salamanca drug houses is discovered by police and Domingo is arrested, Nacho sneaks over rooftops to recover the drug stash before police enter, which impresses Lalo, who begins to take Nacho into his confidence. Nacho then brings Jimmy to Lalo so they arrange to have Domingo released before he talks to police. Jimmy secures Domingo's release and assures his protection by making him a confidential informant for DEA agent Hank Schrader and having him reveal the location of Gus's dead drops. Lalo is pleased by their work, though Nacho warns Jimmy that when working for a drug cartel \\"Once you're in, you're in\\". Nacho reports Lalo's plan for Gus's dead drops to Gus, who unhappily accepts the loss of nearly $1 million to keep secret Nacho's identity as a mole within the Salamanca organization. Unaware that Nacho knows Mike, Gus directs Nacho to report to him. Lalo tries to warn Mike about Gus's ruthlessness, but Mike reminds Nacho that he warned Nacho about the risk he was taking when he tried to kill Hector. With Nacho's assistance, Mike poses as a private detective to feed the police information which ties Lalo to the murder of Fred, the money wire store clerk. Lalo is arrested under an alias and held without bail. He contacts Nacho and orders him to continue harassing Gus by destroying one of Gus's restaurants, which Nacho reports to Mike. Mike alerts Gus, who works with Nacho to destroy the restaurant, again keeping secret Nacho's role as Gus's mole. With Lalo threatening both his legitimate and illegitimate businesses, Gus plans to eliminate him. Mike provides Jimmy details on his investigation of Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, resulting in a judge granting bail, but setting it at $7 million cash. Jimmy collects the money from the Cousins at a remote desert site, but he is waylaid by gunmen as he starts his return trip. Mike was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus, and kills all but one gunman. Mike and Jimmy walk for two days, and eventually make their way back to Albuquerque. Lalo is released and Jimmy says he was alone when his car broke down, so he walked in order to avoid risking the money. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid a trial. Mike briefs Gus about the attack and Gus realizes it was arranged by Juan Bolsa, who believed keeping Lalo in jail would be beneficial to Gus. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to end his role as a mole, but Gus refuses to give up a valuable asset. When Nacho drives Lalo to the same site where Jimmy picked up the money, Lalo realizes they did not pass Jimmy's car. Nacho and Lalo search for it instead of waiting for the Cousins to pick Lalo up. After finding the car where Jimmy and Mike pushed it over the edge of the road, Lalo orders Nacho to drive him back to Albuquerque. Mike calls Jimmy and tells him to hide his cell phone but leave it on so Mike can listen. Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment and as Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby rooftop, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek. When Jimmy continues to say he was alone and his car broke down, Lalo reveals he found bullet holes in the car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo leaves and orders Nacho to drive to Mexico, but not to the original pickup site. Nacho and Lalo arrive the next day at Lalo's fortified Chihuahua ranch, which Mike reports to Gus. Gus says he has sent gunmen to kill Lalo and that Nacho may be able to help. Lalo introduces Nacho to his family and friends, and Nacho receives a call instructing him to leave Lalo's back gate open at 3 a.m. Lalo takes him to meet Don Eladio, who blesses Lalo and Nacho's plan for Nacho to run the Salamanca drug business in Lalo's absence. Lalo is awake at 3 a.m., so Nacho sets a kitchen fire as a distraction. When Lalo goes to investigate, Nacho opens the back gate and flees, while the gunmen kill Lalo's guards and most of his family. After Lalo kills all but one gunman and forces him to call the middleman who arranged the killing to report that Lalo is dead, he looks around and realizes that Nacho is missing.  Breaking Bad  = Season 2 = Though Nacho never appears in Breaking Bad, Saul mentions him when Walter White and Jesse Pinkman kidnap and hold Saul at gunpoint before a newly dug grave in the desert to coerce him into representing Badger, who has been arrested for selling drugs. Believing Walt and Jesse were sent by Lalo he says in panic, \\"It wasn't me, it was Ignacio! He's the one!\\", but is relieved when Walt and Jesse's confusion confirms they have no connection to Lalo. The exact nature of the crime Saul pins on Nacho is not revealed.  Reception  Mando has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Nacho. David Segal, in praising Mando's performance through the fifth season for The New York Times, said \\"[Nacho's] torment is all cinched down, everything roiling behind his eyes. [Mando] manages to convey Nacho’s heartbreaking predicament without raising his voice, or asking for pity.\\"  Notelist   References   External links  *Nacho Varga at AMC Category:Better Call Saul characters Category:Fictional career criminals Category:Fictional double agents Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional henchmen Category:Fictional murderers Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 ","title":"Nacho Varga"},{"id":"46246315","text":"Charles Lindbergh McGill Jr. is a fictional character who appears in the crime drama television series Better Call Saul, a spin-off prequel of Breaking Bad. He is portrayed by Michael McKean, and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. Chuck was born in Cicero, Illinois, United States and is the eldest son of Ruth and Charles McGill Sr. He is the older brother of fellow lawyer and titular character Jimmy McGill (\\"Saul Goodman\\"). Chuck is a successful attorney, who runs his own law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), with business partner and friend Howard Hamlin. Chuck has become semi-reclusive and believes that he suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He was amicably divorced from his wife, Rebecca Bois, who was unaware of his EHS, a few years before the events of Better Call Saul. Although in the first season it seemed that he was initially supportive of Jimmy, Chuck harbored resentful feelings toward him, fearing the questionable ethics of \\"Slipping Jimmy\\" as a lawyer. From the second season onward, Chuck transforms into Jimmy's main antagonist. His betrayal of and opposition to Jimmy, and his subsequent death, serves as a catalyst for Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman. Chuck's life and death also deeply affect Howard Hamlin and Kim Wexler, Jimmy's law partner and wife. Chuck's character development and McKean's performance throughout the first three seasons received critical acclaim, with many critics claiming that McKean gave the best performance on television throughout 2017.  Conception and development  Due to allegedly suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Chuck wears a space blanket (shown above) several times throughout the series Michael McKean had previously worked for Vince Gilligan as the recurring character Morris Fletcher first shown in The X-Files episode \\"Dreamland\\", and the two had kept in touch since about potential projects, though during that time, much of McKean's work was in New York City for Broadway theatre while Gilligan was in Los Angeles for television and could not work anything out. When Gilligan had contacted McKean about acting in Better Call Saul, McKean accepted the role just knowing the bare minimum on Chuck's electromagnetic sensitivity, having been both a fan of Breaking Bad and trusting Gilligan. When filming of Better Call Saul started in 2014, McKean had to initially split his time between that and performing in All the Way, a Broadway play that coincidentally also starred Bryan Cranston, who had played Walter White from Breaking Bad. When McKean's casting had been announced in April 2014, he had been deliberately misnamed to play a character called \\"Dr. Thurber\\", which McKean says was based on humorist James Thurber. Chuck's real name – Charles Lindbergh McGill – was inspired by the aviator Charles Lindbergh. In interviews, McKean has stated that while Chuck did make efforts to foil Jimmy's attempts to get ahead as a lawyer, it wasn't always planned that Chuck would resort to underhanded tricks. He described Chuck's motivations as a person who, until the onset of his electromagnetic sensitivity, had \\"followed all the rules\\", and then suddenly saw all he had slip away and could not understand why, while someone like Jimmy that bent and ignored the rules was thriving. To aid in their portrayals of the characters, McKean and Odenkirk worked out ideas about Chuck and Jimmy's relationships with their parents and the way their parents would have treated them. McKean stated that with Gilligan and Gould's approach, that they are generally told at the start of the season what they would like to see the characters go, but only in two or three episodes before filming, having firmer ideas about specific actions, but that he trusts the showrunners were doing the right thing with the character. McKean spoke of when he got his \\"death call\\" from Gilligan and Gould, letting him known that Chuck would die in the third-season finale \\"Lantern\\", around the time of filming of the seventh episode \\"Expenses\\". McKean had expected the call based on the character's arc, and had no regrets or issues with it, since \\"that Chuck did not belong in Jimmy’s universe by the time he becomes Saul Goodman, so I knew that it was very possible\\".  Character biography  Chuck McGill was born in 1944 and raised in Cicero, Illinois, just outside Chicago. He graduated as valedictorian from Francis Xavier High School at the age of 14, making him the youngest graduate in the history of that school. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania, and graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center. After clerking at both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Chuck joined George Hamlin's solo practice in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Over the next twenty-three years, the two men, joined later by George's son Howard, built up their law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM) into one of the largest law firms in the Southwestern United States. Early in his career, Chuck excelled in criminal law, famously arguing and winning the precedent-setting case of State v. Gonzalez. Ten years before the start of the series, when his younger brother Jimmy faced serious charges after defecating through the sunroof of a romantic rival's BMW – unaware the man's children were in the backseat – Chuck defended him on the condition that Jimmy abandon his career as a con artist and work a legitimate job in HHM's mailroom. During this time, Jimmy was inspired by Chuck's skill in the legal profession and decided to become a lawyer himself. Jimmy secretly completed his college degree, attended a correspondence law school, and passed the bar exam. He also became friendly, then romantically involved, with Kim Wexler, a legal student who also worked in the mail room and became an associate attorney at HHM. Around the time of his divorce from Rebecca Bois, Chuck took a leave of absence from HHM after allegedly developing electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Jimmy, who had quit HHM to practice law after he passed his bar exam but was refused a job by the firm, took care of Chuck, including buying and delivering his groceries and newspapers.  Season 1  Jimmy continues to help Chuck with daily chores at his home. While Chuck no longer works directly for HHM, he is still a senior partner. Howard attempts to buy out Chuck's share of HHM with a token payment, but Jimmy demands Howard pay Chuck in full, which Howard is unprepared to do. Jimmy stages a fake rescue of a billboard worker to drum up publicity for his own firm, and removes Chuck's local newspaper from his daily delivery so Chuck will not know. Chuck resorts to stealing the neighbor's paper (leaving a $5 bill as payment) which leads the police to arrive, confront Chuck, break into his home, and tase him. Chuck is taken to the hospital and when Jimmy arrives, the doctor proves that Chuck's illness is psychosomatic. Jimmy refuses the doctor's recommendation to have Chuck committed to a mental institution and insists he can care for Chuck at home. Jimmy discovers that the Sandpiper Crossing retirement community may be overcharging its elderly residents. He collects shredded documents from the trash and starts piecing them together at Chuck's place. Chuck is impressed with Jimmy's legal instincts and steps in to help, discovering key documents that prove Jimmy is correct. Jimmy and Chuck attempt to get Sandpiper to settle but their lawyers refuse, so the McGills continue to collect evidence. Chuck's enthusiasm for the law is rekindled and he casually steps outside to get documents from Jimmy's car without taking his usual electromagnetic hypersensitivity precautions, surprising them both. Chuck suggests the case is too large for the two of them and they should get HHM's help. Howard agrees to take the case, and offers Jimmy a small of counsel fee and a percentage of the judgment or settlement, but cuts him out of active participation. Jimmy surmises that Chuck secretly used Howard to get Jimmy off the case, and that Chuck did the same thing after Jimmy passed the bar exam but Howard refused to hire him as an attorney at HHM. Jimmy confronts Chuck, who tells Jimmy he doesn't consider him a \\"real lawyer\\" and says Jimmy is still the same con man from Cicero (referring to his former alias, \\"Slippin' Jimmy\\"). Jimmy cuts ties with Chuck and arranges for Howard to take over Chuck's care.  Season 2  Howard hires Ernesto as an aide for Chuck, and Ernesto takes on most of the tasks formerly seen to by Jimmy. As the Sandpiper case grows, HHM brings in another firm to assist, Davis & Main. Davis & Main hires Jimmy due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Chuck become suspicious after Jimmy uses questionable tactics to gain new class action plaintiffs. Jimmy creates a television ad to attract more plaintiffs and airs it without approval. Cliff Main and the partners at D & M reprimand him, as do Howard and Chuck, and Jimmy decides to quit the firm. Howard relegates Kim, who knew of Jimmy's ad but did not inform the partners at HHM, to entry-level document review work. To regain Howard's favor, she tries to land a new client and eventually gains interest from Mesa Verde bank. Howard is happy to have the bank's lucrative legal work, but gives Kim no recognition for securing the client. Kim takes Jimmy's advice and leaves HHM to start her own firm, co- located with his. Kim initially secures Mesa Verde as a client, but Howard and Chuck succeed in winning them back. Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms reappear as the result of his trip to HHM's offices to meet with the Mesa Verde representatives. When Ernesto calls Jimmy for help, Jimmy offers to stay with Chuck overnight and uses the opportunity to alter documents Chuck has prepared for a new Mesa Verde branch application. When the state banking board reviews the application, it discovers the errors, which result in a long and expensive delay. Mesa Verde's president and counsel take the bank's business to Kim. Chuck immediately suspects Jimmy sabotaged him. Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy goes to the copy store where he altered the documents, intending to bribe the clerk for his silence. Ernesto is already there, having investigated copy stores throughout Albuquerque on Chuck's behalf. Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to speak with the clerk in person. Jimmy bribes the clerk, then waits across the street for Chuck to arrive. Chuck attempts to question the clerk, but his electromagnetic hypersensitivity causes him to collapse and hit his head on the counter. Jimmy hesitates about whether to reveal his presence, but enters the store, administers first aid, and has the clerk summon an ambulance. At the hospital, Chuck wonders how Jimmy was on the scene so quickly, and Ernesto falsely claims to have called him out of concern for Chuck's health. Chuck later fakes a major mental breakdown, causing Jimmy to confess to the document tampering in an effort to calm Chuck down. After Jimmy leaves Chuck's home, Chuck reveals a hidden voice recorder, which he activated before Jimmy's arrival.  Season 3  Chuck promises Jimmy consequences for his Mesa Verde fraud. Chuck and Howard discuss the recording, which Howard says is not admissible in court, but Chuck says it has a use. He arranges for Ernesto to hear it, then swears him to silence. As Chuck expected, Ernesto tells Kim, who then tells Jimmy. Unsure of Chuck's plan, Kim wants Jimmy to let Chuck make the first move, but Jimmy ignores her advice, breaks into Chuck's house and destroys the recording. Chuck's private investigator and Howard reveal themselves as witnesses to Jimmy's break-in, which is cause for him to be arrested. Jimmy is prosecuted and Chuck suggests to the assistant district attorney that Jimmy can avoid prison by confessing to the break-in and making the confession available to the state bar association. With Jimmy facing potential disbarment, Kim offers to help him fight the charges, and Jimmy agrees. During a meeting to discuss the proceedings, Chuck admits to Kim that he has a copy of the recording and intends to use it at Jimmy's hearing. Kim's response to Jimmy indicates that obtaining this admission from Chuck was central to their planned defense. Kim cancels the repairman Chuck had called to fix the door Jimmy destroyed during the break-in. Mike Ehrmantraut poses as a repairman and fixes the door while also photographing Chuck's home to document his bizarre living conditions. The hearing room is prepared for Chuck's arrival, including turning off all lights and electronic devices, and removing cell phones. Jimmy invites Chuck's ex- wife Rebecca to the hearing, claiming Chuck is in distress and needs her help, but Chuck sees it as an attempt to rattle him before he testifies. When Jimmy cross-examines Chuck about his electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Chuck suspects a trick and accuses Jimmy of standing near him while holding his cell phone. Jimmy then reveals that he had Huell Babineaux secretly place Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket, and Chuck carried it for more than an hour without noticing. The suggestion that his illness is mental rather than physical unnerves Chuck, who launches an extended tirade in which he vents all his frustrations about Jimmy. Chuck realizes, too late, that his outburst has shocked the entire courtroom, including the committee. Jimmy is given a year's suspension, but not disbarred. Chuck shutters himself in his home, and Rebecca tries to get Jimmy to help but he refuses. Howard suggests Chuck consider Jimmy's suspension a victory and move on and Chuck agrees. The possibility that his illness is psychosomatic causes Chuck to begin seeing Dr. Cruz, who aids him in coping with his symptoms to the point where he can walk outside and perform chores such as grocery shopping without taking his usual precautions. Jimmy tries to avoid losing money he prepaid for television ads by producing commercials for other businesses. He meets with his malpractice insurer to obtain a refund on his premium, and finds that his policy must remain in effect during his suspension in case he is sued over work he did previously. Jimmy feigns an emotional breakdown about Chuck's condition, which prompts the insurer to review Chuck's insurance coverage. The insurance company's representatives meet with Howard and Chuck and inform them that HHM's malpractice rates will rise substantially unless another attorney is assigned to constantly supervise Chuck. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard decides that Chuck has become too much of a liability and encourages him to retire. Chuck sues HHM, hoping this will force Howard to back down. To his surprise, Howard calls his bluff by buying out Chuck's share of the partnership, using personal funds and loans to make the first of three $3 million payments. Howard then announces to the firm that Chuck has retired, effective immediately. Jimmy tries to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck coldly cuts ties. Chuck's hypersensitivity symptoms begin to re-emerge, and he becomes obsessed with finding the device that is causing his electric meter to run. He stacks his appliances outside, tears the walls open to remove wiring, and destroys the meter after failing to discover why it will not stop. Having reached his breaking point, Chuck intentionally knocks over a gas lantern and sets his home on fire, which ends up killing him.  Season 4  Jimmy is shocked at Chuck's death and believes himself to be at fault because of his interaction with the insurance company. Howard believes Chuck's death was his fault because he forced Chuck to retire. Upon hearing this, Jimmy allows Howard to shoulder the blame and regains his usual upbeat demeanor. Chuck leaves most of his estate to his ex-wife, with only a $5,000 bequest to Jimmy, which is just enough to prevent him from contesting the will. When Kim picks up Jimmy's inheritance check, Howard gives her a letter Chuck wrote to Jimmy. Kim eventually gives it to Jimmy, who reads it in her presence. The letter is undated, but was apparently written while Jimmy was working in the HHM mailroom. The letter praises Jimmy's efforts to leave his conman past behind and work an honest job, but is also vaguely condescending. Jimmy calls it \\"nice\\", but Kim is visibly upset by it. Jimmy learns HHM is struggling financially because of the payments due to Chuck's estate, and because recent events caused them to lose clients. Jimmy tries a \\"tough love\\" speech to rouse Howard back to action. During his suspension, Jimmy manages a cell phone store, then develops a lucrative side business selling prepaid phones to unsavory customers under the alias \\"Saul Goodman\\". A year later, Jimmy attends his reinstatement hearing and is surprised to learn that his suspension will be continued because he failed to address the conflict with Chuck during questioning from the panel members. Jimmy appeals, and in preparation for the hearing Kim helps him fake several public displays of grief over Chuck's death. At the appeal, Jimmy begins to read from Chuck's letter, then stops and gives an impromptu speech in which he vows to be worthy of the McGill name if reinstated. Jimmy's appeal succeeds, but he reveals to Kim that the speech was an insincere performance and he plans to practice law as Saul Goodman. Chuck appears in two flashbacks. In the first, set 10 years before the show's 2003 present, the staff at HHM congratulate pre-illness Chuck after he argues obscure case law to successfully close a lucrative case for the firm. The reception Chuck receives serves as a catalyst for Jimmy's subsequent legal studies, which he carries out in secret. In the second, Chuck appears with Jimmy before the board of bar examiners during the admission of new attorneys in 1998, and provides Jimmy's ritual introduction and character reference. Following the ceremony, Chuck attends a celebration for Jimmy at a karaoke bar, and brings Jimmy home after the party.  Season 5  Chuck does not appear, but his life and death continue to affect Jimmy, Howard, and Kim. Jimmy has fully embraced the Saul Goodman alias he used while selling prepaid phones, telling Kim that continuing to use it gives him an instant client base for a criminal law practice. When Kim tries to talk him out of practicing law as Saul, Jimmy indicates that it is necessary if he is to escape the shadow left by Chuck's professional legacy. Chuck becomes Kim's posthumous brother- in-law when she marries Jimmy, a tactic that enables Jimmy to tell Kim the truth about his work as Saul by attaching spousal privilege to their conversations. Howard proposes hiring Jimmy at HHM. When Jimmy brings up his history with the firm, Howard assures him that the feud was only between Jimmy and Chuck. Jimmy thanks Howard, but is unsettled by the reminder of his past, and refuses Howard's offer. Jimmy is so unnerved that he irritates Howard by using bowling balls to vandalize his car and prostitutes to disrupt his business lunch with Clifford Main. When Howard confronts Jimmy and rescinds his offer, Jimmy responds by lambasting Howard for causing Chuck's death and angrily tells him that as Saul Goodman, he has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM. When Howard sees Kim at the courthouse, she tells him she quit Schweikart and Cokely and her work for Mesa Verde so that she can concentrate on pro bono criminal defense cases. Howard tells Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment campaign against him and assumes Kim that Jimmy is behind her decision. Kim laughs at Howard, says she is insulted by the idea that she cannot decide for herself, and tells him he does not understand Jimmy. Howard angrily tells Kim that Chuck really did know Jimmy better than anyone else.  Reception  Michael McKean portrays Chuck Michael McKean's portrayal of Chuck McGill has received critical acclaim. For his performances as Chuck, Michael McKean won a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2018 at the 22nd Satellite Awards. McKean later received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series nomination for his guest appearance in the fourth season. The first season episode \\"Pimento\\" received critical acclaim, with many critics praising the performances from Bob Odenkirk and Michael McKean. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9.0 rating; concluding: \\"Better Call Saul revealed the betrayal that may very well be at the heart of what turns Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman, as this stunningly crafted story continues to unfold.\\" The third season episode \\"Chicanery\\" received universal acclaim, with some critics considering it to be a series-best. Terri Schwartz of IGN awarded the episode a perfect 10 out of 10, describing it as \\"the best episode of Better Call Saul to date\\". It currently holds a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 9.5/10 based on 12 reviews. The site consensus reads: \\"The war between Jimmy and Chuck comes to an unprecedented climax in the heartbreaking, sober, and defining 'Chicanery', an episode that clearly cements Better Call Saul as essential television.\\" TVLine named Michael McKean the \\"Performer of the Week\\" for his performance in this episode, writing it was the \\"finest showcase yet for his fascinatingly layered performance as Jimmy's brother Chuck McGill.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating, praised the courtroom scene, saying \\"it isn’t just to give us the satisfaction of a courtroom drama, the neat ending where the truth comes out. The brilliance of this structure is to give us a slow-motion view of the heavens falling, an outcome methodically pursued by Kim and Jimmy, which nevertheless seems to give them no satisfaction.\\" Many critics were disappointed when McKean, who was said to have given \\"one of the best performances by anyone in TV all year\\", failed to secure an Emmy nomination in 2017 while his co-star Jonathan Banks did. Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture considers him to be the Better Call Saul equivalent of Breaking Bad character Skyler White. In 2020, Screen Rant ranked him #9 amongst main characters for likeability, only above Hector Salamanca. They said: \\"The first few seasons of the show go into a lot of detail showing how Jimmy lost his way in his career as an honest lawyer. A big part of the issue was due to his own brother, Chuck McGill. Chuck is a successful lawyer in his own right but instead of being proud of Jimmy following in his footsteps, he tried to hold him back.\\"  References   External links  * Chuck McGill at AMC Category:Better Call Saul characters Category:Fictional American lawyers Category:Fictional characters from Illinois Category:Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders Category:Fictional managers Category:Fictional suicides Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 ","title":"Chuck McGill"},{"id":"46246318","text":"Morville Chote (born 6 October 1924) is a British former javelin thrower who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics.

It is unusual for its genus in that its flowers are yellow or creamy-white but age to a pinkish-red.habitfruit Description Melaleuca dichroma is a shrub which can grow to a height of . The leaves are arranged alternately, linear to narrow oval in shape, long, wide and lack a stalk. The flowers are arranged in heads near the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes in the upper leaf axils. There are one to four groups of three flowers in each head, the heads up to in diameter. The flowers appear in spring and are initially pale yellow to creamy-white but fade to pinkish-red. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers age. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 6 to 13 stamens in each bundle. Flowering occurs from August to November and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in clusters. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca urceolaris subsp. virgata was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis. In 1999 it was raised to species status as Melaleuca virgata by Lyndley Craven and Brendan Lepschi but the name was not valid. The name was changed in 2001 to Melaleuca dichroma by Craven and Lepschi in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (dichroma) is from the Greek di- meaning \\"two\\" or \\"double\\" and chroma, \\"colour\\", referring to the two colour phases of the flowers as they age. This species is closely related to Melaleuca urceolaris, differing mainly in the arrangement of the flowers. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca dichroma occurs in the Arrino, Hill River and Moora districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy, gravelly and loamy soils. Ecology Melaleuca gnidioides is a distantly related species whose flowers also change colour as they age. It may signal to pollinators that a reward is no longer available. Conservation status Melaleuca dichroma is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This species is not well known in cultivation, but the similar Melaleuca urceolaris has been grown successfully for its showy flowers and interesting foliage, suggesting that Melaleuca dichroma may also have horticultural merit, especially for its two-tone flowers.

He played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers and Maryland Terrapins. High school career Wells played high school basketball at Word of God Academy in Raleigh, North Carolina where he was a friend of and teammate with current Washington Wizards guard John Wall. College career Wells began his college career at Xavier, where he was an Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team selection. He was expelled in 2012 due to a \\"serious violation\\" of the code of student conduct after a female student alleged he committed sexual assault. Wells also was suspended by the NCAA for being involved in a huge fight after a game against the Cincinnati Bearcats in December 2011. A grand jury did not indict him for the assault, and Wells later sued the university for false accusation. The school was asked to hold off deciding their case until after the criminal case was settled and the prosecutor slammed the school for their unfair procedures. The issue was settled out of court after a judge ruled the lawsuit could go forward to discovery. The NCAA waived the usual redshirt year requirement for Wells, making him eligible immediately at another university. He transferred to Maryland and led the team in scoring with 13.1 points per game as a sophomore. The team missed the NCAA Tournament despite defeating Duke twice. As a junior, Wells averaged 14.9 points per game for the Terrapins. Maryland again missed the NCAA Tournament. A wrist injury caused Wells to miss a month of games as a senior. Nevertheless, he scored 26 points and added seven rebounds and four assists in Maryland's 59-53 win over fifth- ranked Wisconsin. He was a First Team All-Big Ten selection.

Scott Kelly (identical twin of Mark Kelly) and Mikhail Korniyenko spent 340 days in space, with scientists performing medical experiments. Kelly and Kornienko launched on 27 March 2015 on Soyuz TMA-16M along with Gennady Padalka. The mission encompassed Expeditions 43, 44, 45 and 46. The pair safely landed in Kazakhstan on March 2, 2016, returning aboard Soyuz TMA-18M with Sergey Volkov. The mission supported the NASA Twins study, which helps shed light on the health effects of long-duration spaceflight, which is of interest for Mars missions especially. On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results from the NASA Twins study which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared with the other. Selection Mark and Scott Kelly are identical twins, and will be studied for changes in their health, comparing a body in space to a body on earth In November 2012, NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), and their international partners selected two veteran spacefarers for a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015. The mission included collecting scientific data important to future human exploration of the Solar System. Kelly and Korniyenko already had a connection; Kelly was a backup crew member for the station's Expedition 23/24 crews, where Korniyenko served as a flight engineer. The goal aboard the orbiting laboratory was to understand better how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment of space. Data from the mission was intended to help inform current assessments of crew performance and health and determine better and validate countermeasures to reduce the risks associated with future exploration as NASA plans for missions around the Moon, asteroids and ultimately Mars. Results On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results, from the NASA Twins study, which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared with the other. The study also required the astronauts to keep a journal, and investigated the psychological effects of living in a confined space for an extended length of time. Kornienko said of his experiences on Expedition 23/24: \\"The thing you miss there most of all is the Earth itself, I missed smells. I missed trees, I even dreamt of them. I even hallucinated. I thought I smelled a real fire and something being barbecued on it! I ended up putting pictures of trees on the walls to cheer up. You do miss the Earth there.\\" Scott stated that he missed feeling changes in the weather while on the ISS. NASA Twin Study Effect of spaceflight on the human body The International Space Station developed exercise equipment, including treadmills and resistance devices to limit muscle atrophy in a low gravity environment. Weightlessness causes body fluids in astronauts to accumulate in the upper half of the body, leading to facial edema and unwelcome side effects. One problem may be the low gravity affecting the body in unforeseen ways and it can be hard to detect the cause and effect of gravity on the body. Space seems to cause trouble for a number of body parts including bone, sometimes the eyes, and a classic problem is space sickness. Longest time spent in space by other astronauts The Soyuz TMA-18M spacecraft is seen as it lands with Expedition 46 Commander Scott Kelly of NASA and Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Sergey Volkov of Roscosmos near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan on Wednesday, March 2, 2016 (Kazakh time).

Gelatin, a bipolymer, is produced through the hydrolysis of collagen. Gelatin, along with its more familiar uses, is widely used for the production of microparticles due to its efficiency in forming gels as well as its biodegradability as a particle. Gelatin can be manipulated to form a stable matrix for biologically reactive compounds, allowing for the incorporation and protection against enzymatic degradation. Gelatin Microparticles are versatile particles and are easily loadable for the use within drug systems and alongside growth factors post-synthesis. Gelatin microparticles also allow for the biochemically controlled release of drug particles, growth factors, and other biological molecules. Production There are multiple production protocols used to synthesize gelatin microparticles. These production protocols include spray drying, precipitation, solvent evaporation, and emulsification. Water in water (w/w) emulsification is the most popular method of production. W/w was developed in order to address the loss of parrtical- product bioactivity which is associated with chemically induced preparation. Applications Gelatin microparticles have an array of applications in research science due to their biocompatibility and controlled release systems. Both factors have attracted much interest and attention to the particles. Gelatin Microparticles have been used to encapsulate growth factors, such as TGF-β1-3, into delivery systems as well as served as microcarriers for chondrocyte expansion. Gelatin microparticles have also been incorporated to form 3D scaffolding systems through aggregation \\"in vitro\\" while also performing known use as a molecule delivery system. With the use of radioactively labeled growth factors, gelatin microparticles release kinetics can be altered, as was done through varied release groups of BMP-2 over four week intervals. Gelatin microparticles also serve as enhancers of calcium deposition, which serves as an indicator of tissue regeneration.

Beginning January 1, 2020, home care agencies that provide personal care services must have an EVV solution in place or risk having their Medicaid claims denied, under a mandate included in the 21st Century Cures Act. While the federal mandate sets key data points that must be collected and electronically verified, states create their own systems. State governments decide how to gather and report data that EVV vendors use, and whether to include additional EVV compliance rules. History Healthcare spending in the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Electronic visit verification was created to help cut down on fraud and ensure that people receive the documented care they need. EVV was designed to help verify that services billed for home healthcare are for actual visits made. The passing of the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 made provisions for the cut down of fraud and over-payments, requiring states to stop Medicaid payments to providers when there is credible evidence of fraud. At least 10 states implemented an office of inspector general to oversee Medicaid fraud investigations, with many moving towards a system of verifying home healthcare visits in order to help reduce fraud. President Obama signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010. Several states have introduced electronic visit verification with some mandating it for home healthcare. In January 2014, Illinois became the first state to mandate the use of EVV when the Department of Human Services required it for its home services program. As of June 1, 2015, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission mandates that electronic visit verification be used for all home healthcare visits billed to the state. The state of Ohio began the process of implementing an electronic verification system that would be used starting in 2016. It estimated the use of EVV will save the state approximately $9.5 million in its first two years of use. Other states that use but do not mandate EVV include Louisiana, Alaska, and Tennessee. Electronic visit verification is widely used throughout the healthcare industry, not solely by government entities. Companies use it for compliance and quality assurance. Employers of home healthcare providers use it to verify employee's locations as well as document patient care. It can also be used to verify hours of work and document time sheets for healthcare workers. Health care fraud Health care fraud includes health insurance fraud, drug fraud, and medical fraud. Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as Medicare (United States) or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the False Claims Act, most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a \\"whistleblower\\", or relator (law). Tracking software Electronic visit verification is mainly done through the use of GPS tracking and computer software. It can also include the use of telephone based systems where healthcare workers can call-in from each location. GPS can be used to track the location of nurses, or a \\"check-in\\" system can be used requiring healthcare providers to clock in when they are at a home visit. EVV is also used by employers to track employees and determine their compensation. Electronic visit verification software integrates with payroll systems that allow companies to verify payroll of its nurses. Many EVV software providers employ a cloud-based system that integrates with a mobile app to coordinate schedules, billing, payroll, communication, and patient documentation. Nurses can update patient files with the system while also submitting working hours to their employers. In contrast, companies such as First Data provide a telephone and computer-based system for verification, similar to the system implemented in the state of Texas in 2015.

He performed with other blues musicians of the period and worked as a session musician. Following a hiatus from music, Robinson returned to the profession in the 1990s to record his own material for full-length albums. Biography Robinson was born on April 30, 1931, in Chicago, Illinois. As a child he lived with his grandparents. He was taught to play the guitar by his neighbor, the blues musician Blind Percy (who would later accompany him in concerts in the area). In 1942, Robinson began playing in the Maxwell Street market, where he also performed with local musicians. In 1948, Robinson met Eddie Taylor, and the two worked the Chicago club scene together until 1952. After the two split, Robinson formed a band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with Freddie King, whom he met outside a welfare center. The band lasted four years, and King later credited Robinson as one of his earliest and most influential teachers. In 1955, Robinson joined a band led by Little Walter, which became popular in Chicago. In 1958 Walter was incapacitated by a shooting, and Robinson became the vocalist of the group in Walter's absence, but he left the band later that year, because of personnel issues. Throughout the 1950s, Robinson was in demand as a session musician, playing bass guitar and rhythm guitar for such artists as Howlin' Wolf, Sonny Cooper, and Magic Sam. In addition to his session work, he recorded three singles for the Bandera label, including one of his signature songs, \\"All of My Life\\", in 1960. In 1965, Robinson toured in Europe with Buddy Guy, Big Mama Thornton, and John Lee Hooker as a part of Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau's American Folk Blues Festival. Robinson continued to tour and record in the United States, but, with the combination of the death of his mother and the fading popularity of the blues, his musical activity declined in the late 1960s. During this time, he opened a candy store in Chicago and toured a few more times, often with his longtime friend Little Willie Anderson, and recorded, but at an inconsistent rate. In the 1980s, however, Robinson abandoned his music career and worked as a carpenter and later a cab driver for most of the decade. In the late 1980s, members of a local blues band called Ice Cream Men encouraged Robinson to make a comeback. He returned to music and recorded his first studio album in 1994 for Delmark Records, entitled Lonely Traveller, which included old and new tracks by Robinson. Four more albums followed: Guns, Gangs, and Drugs in 1996; Maxwell Street Blues in 1998; \\"Remember Me\\", a solo acoustic recording on the APO label in 1998; and All My Life in 2001. Robinson's comeback was capped by his active protest to prevent the gentrification of Maxwell Street. He was a member of the Maxwell Street Historic Preservation Coalition and wrote the group's theme song, \\"Maxwell Street Teardown Blues\\". Most of the buildings along the street were to have been demolished so the University of Illinois could expand. In protest, Robinson performed in 2000 on Maxwell Street, playing \\"Maxwell Street Teardown Blues\\", and fasted for 81 days. Despite the protest of Robinson and others, the street was almost completely demolished by the end of the year. Later in the year, Robinson changed his name to J. L. Latif Aliomar as a part of his religious conversion to Islam. Early in 2002, Robinson was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his sinuses, which was removed in April of the same year. He began performing again four days later in celebration of his 71st birthday at the Deep Blue Club. However, the cancer had already spread to the rest of his body, and his health deteriorated to the point of no recovery. On July 6, 2002, he was found dead in his car in Chicago with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Robinson most likely committed suicide to avoid the suffering stemming from his failing health.

Festus's epitome is typically dated to the 2nd century, but the work only survives in a partial 11th-century manuscript and copies of its own separate epitome. Background Verrius Flaccus was a prominent Roman grammarian known for his writings on the Latin language and for tutoring the grandsons of Caesar Augustus during his reign. He is best known for De verborum significatu, the name which Festus later adopted for his epitome, the first major alphabetical Latin dictionary. The 40-volume lexicon is regarded as among the most important such works of Classical Antiquity, though all but a few fragments of the original have been lost, perhaps in part due to its impractical size. Sextus Pompeius Festus, also a grammarian, likely flourished in the later 2nd century and is thought to have come from Narbo in Gaul, though few details are known about his life. Festus wrote his epitome of Flaccus's works during a time in the history of the Roman Empire when greater priority was placed on defense after a long period of expansion. There was an anxious effort by many scholars to record their history and culture as means of preservation. Though another of Festus's books is mentioned in De Verborum Significatione, none of his other works have survived. Festus's work originally contained 20 volumes. The only surviving copy is the Codex Farnesianus, an 11th-century copy in poor condition, missing the first half of its alphabetized entries and suffering fire damage. Much of what we know about it comes from a summary of the full original, abridged in the 8th century by Paul the Deacon (Paulus Diaconus) as a contribution to the library of Charlemagne. As Festus reduced Flaccus from 40 to 20 volumes, so did Paul condense Festus by roughly half, excising entries he considered unnecessary or redundant, modifying parts of the text he thought unclear or obscure, and stripping away details like citations. Paul the Deacon abridged and revised the work in the 8th century Content The entries in Festus's epitome are organized semi-alphabetically, grouped according to first but not following letters, and with some exceptions according to particular themes, arguments, or sources. Festus altered some of Flaccus's text and inserted some critical remarks of his own. He updated the language, omitting Latin words that had fallen out of use, and documented his modifications in the now lost separate work, Priscorum verborum cum exemplis. Though it is a summary, Festus preserves a great deal of Flaccus's original work, including etymologies and definitions and the rich historical, religious, political, and cultural information the original De Verborum Significatione is known for. In an 1880 essay about Flaccus, classical scholar Henry Nettleship criticized Festus's work as \\"an affair of scissors and paste, in which conceit and incompetence are perhaps equally blended\\". Other scholars, like Alessandro Moscadi, suggest understanding it as instead a work of independent scholarship. Scholarship When a copy of Paul's version was discovered by scholars at the Abbey of St. Gall in 1416, during the Italian Renaissance, it attracted a surge of renewed interest and study. The Italian humanists, who were enthusiastically seeking out and studying ancient Latin texts, made a number of significant contributions to the work, and several copies from the time still exist today. De Verborum Significatione is a valuable resource for scholars studying language use, culture, religion, social life, and the broader history of Ancient Rome. It also provides insight into other Romans and their works which used, were used by, influenced, or were influenced by Flaccus's work. For example, Flaccus utilized Marcus Terentius Varro's lost Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum (47 BCE) while Pliny the Elder drew a great deal from Flaccus for his highly influential Naturalis Historia (c. 77 CE). Among the other authors Festus cites are Lucius Accius, Cornificius, Sulpicius Rufus, Gaius Ateius Capito, and Ennius. Festus included many quotations and citations from authors for whom it serves as the only record of their work. For others, such as Plautus, whose work would otherwise be known only through copies and quotations made much later, Festus provides verification or highlights the ways in which it had been altered. The Festus Lexicon project at University College London is collating the fragments that remain of Festus's work and republishing them with translations. The project's aims are to provide public access to the work and to encourage study of both the work itself and the subjects it covers.

He was the youngest of four sons of Æthelfrith, an ealdorman in Mercia, and his wife Æthelgyth. From 946 until his death in 949 Eadric was the second most senior ealdorman in England, surpassed only by his brother Æthelstan Half-King. Biography Eadric was born to Æthelfrith, an ealdorman who ruled territory in southern and eastern Mercia, and his wife Æthelgyth, who came from a family with considerable wealth that owned land in Buckinghamshire. Eadric was the youngest of four brothers, the other three being Ælfstan, Æthelstan Half-King, and Æthelwold, all four of whom were made ealdormen between 925 and 950.Hart 2004 Ælfstan, the eldest brother, succeeded to his father's ealdordom upon the death of his father around 915, though he died in 934. Æthelstan Half-King was made Ealdorman of East Anglia in 932, though his jurisdiction also included Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire and parts of Lincolnshire. Æthelwold was granted an ealdordom in 940, ruling over Kent and neighbouring counties including Essex. Eadric was the last of the four brothers to be granted an ealdordom, ruling over central Wessex from 942 onwards.Woolf, p. 182 He succeeded a man named Ælfhere as ealdorman.Hart 1973, p. 108 By about 945 Eadric and his two surviving brothers between them controlled over half the kingdom.Lapidge et al., p. 58 Beginning in 943 Æthelstan is listed first among the king's ealdormen when witnessing charters, indicating his premier position. Æthelwold is listed second and Eadric is listed between third and sixth depending on the particular charter. Æthelwold died in 946, leaving land in Sussex and on the Berkshire Downs to Eadric. A later charter by King Eadred details land at these same two places to be given to Eadric, though it is not known whether this refers to new land or is simply of a confirmation of the land left to Eadric by his brother. Following Æthelwold's death Eadric is listed second only to his brother Æthelstan when witnessing royal charters. Eadric died in 949 and was succeeded as ealdorman by Æthelsige. It is possible that Eadric was the father of Æthelweard (historian), if true then he had at least four children, the others being Æthelweard's siblings Ælfweard, Ælfgifu and Ælfwaru. This identification rests on Ælfgifu's possession of the estate of Risborough, which had belonged to Eadric's mother, Æthelgyth. Ælfgifu is often identified with Ælfgifu, wife of Eadwig, and that queen's documented mother, Æthelgifu, would then be Eadric's wife.

Ye served as President of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Vice-President of the Chinese Astronomical Society, and Vice- President of the International Astronomical Union. She is a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain. The asteroid 3241 Yeshuhua is named after her. Early life Ye Shuhua was born June 21, 1927 in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. She spent most of her school years during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), and had to move repeatedly with her family from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, Shaoguan, and Lian County, because of the war. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou resumed its admissions. Ye hoped to study literature at the university, but her father wanted her to study medicine for better career prospects. She was not interested in medicine, and as a compromise with her father, she agreed to study mathematics instead. At the time, mathematics and astronomy were under the same department at Sun Yat- sen University, and under the influence of Professor Zou Yixin, she later chose to major in astronomy. Career In 1951, Ye Shuhua moved to Shanghai with her husband Cheng Jitai (), who taught at the mathematics department of Fudan University. Ye found work at the French-built Zikawei (Xujiahui) Observatory, which later became part of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory. In 1958, she became the leader of a team of scientists working to improve the precision of China's measurement of Universal Time, which ranked the last in the world. By 1963, China's Universal Time measurement leapt to the world's second most precise. It was set as the basic national standard in 1965, and her team later received many national awards for this achievement. When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, Ye Shushua, like many other intellectuals, was persecuted and held in a \\"cowshed\\" (). She also had to work as a house painter. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Ye was appointed research professor of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, and served as its director between 1981 and 1993. Under her leadership, Shanghai Observatory established a very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) and a satellite laser ranging (SLR) research station, and participated in the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) as one of the most technologically advanced bases. In 1991, she was appointed the chief scientist in a Key Basic Research Project to study China's crustal motion. The project verified that the Indian Plate is causing an eastward movement of China's land mass. Ye Shuhua served as Vice-President of the Chinese Astronomical Society from 1978 to 1988, after which she became its honorary president. She served as Vice- President of the International Astronomical Union from 1988 to 1994. She was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980, and a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain in 1985. Honours and awards The Purple Mountain Observatory named the asteroid 3241 Yeshuhua after her. She has been awarded the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize for astronomy.

It aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service, by allowing users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony. From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.  History  The initial project was created inside Amdocs, while building a chat tool called \\"Amdocs Unified Communications\\", by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape. Amdocs then funded most of the development work from 2014 to October 2017. Matrix was the winner of the Innovation award at WebRTC 2014 Conference & Expo, and of the \\"Best in Show\\" award at WebRTC World in 2015. The protocol received praise mixed with some cautionary notes after it launched in 2014. Reviewers noted that other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type had difficulties becoming widely adopted—e.g. XMPP and IRCv3—and have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political. Some were unclear if there was enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers. In 2015, a subsidiary of Amdocs was created, named \\"Vector Creations Limited\\", and the Matrix staff was moved there. In July 2017, the funding by Amdocs was announced to be cut and in the following weeks the core team created their own UK-based company, \\"New Vector\\", which was mainly built to support the development of Matrix and Riot, which was later renamed to Element. During this time period, there were multiple calls for support to the community and companies that build on Matrix, to help pay for the wages of at least part of the core team. Patreon and Liberapay crowdfunding accounts were created, and the core team started a video podcast, called Matrix \\"Live\\" to keep the contributors up to speed with ongoing developments. This was expanded by a weekly blog format, called \\"This Week in Matrix\\", where interested community members could read, or submit their own, Matrix-related news. The company was created with the goal of offering consultancy services for Matrix and paid hosting of Matrix servers (as a platform called modular.im) to generate income. In the early weeks after its creation, the Matrix team and the company Purism published plans to collaborate in the creation of the Librem 5 phone. The Librem 5 was intended to be a Matrix native phone, where the default pre- installed messaging and caller app should use Matrix for audio and video calls and instant messaging. In 2017, KDE announced it was working on including support for the protocol in its IRC client Konversation. In late January 2018, the company received an investment of USD $5 million from Status, an Ethereum based startup. In April 2018, the French Government announced plans to create their own instant messaging tool. Work on the application based on Riot and Matrix protocol—called Tchap after French scientists Claude Chappe—had started in early 2018 and the program was open-sourced and released on iOS and Android in April 2019. In October 2018, a Community Interest Company called \\"The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C.\\" was incorporated, to serve as a neutral legal entity for further development of the standard. In February 2019, the KDE community announced plans to adopt Matrix for its internal communications needs, as a decentralized alternative to other instant messaging servers like Telegram, Slack, and Discord, and operate its own server instance. In April 2019, Matrix.org suffered a security breach in which the production servers were compromised. This breach was not an issue with the Matrix protocol and did not directly affect homeservers other than matrix.org. In June 2019, the Matrix protocol is out of beta with the version 1.0 across all APIs (and Synapse, at the time the reference homeserver), and the Matrix foundation is officially launched.https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing- matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation/ https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released/ In October 2019, New Vector raised an additional USD $8.5 million to develop Matrix. In December 2019 German Ministry of Defense announced a pilot project called BwMessenger for secure instant messaging tool based on Matrix protocol, Synapse server and Riot application. This is modeled after French Tchap project. The long-term goal of the Federal Government is the secure use of messenger services that covers all ministries and subordinate authorities. In December 2019 Mozilla announced that it would begin to use Matrix as a replacement for IRC. In the announcement, they said that they would be completing the move in late January 2020. The Mozilla IRC server, irc.mozilla.org, is said to be removed \\"no later than March of next year [2020]\\".https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-the- decision/50620 In May 2020 Matrix enabled end-to-end encryption by default for private conversations.https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/06/cross-signing-and- end-to-end-encryption-by-default-is-here Protocol Matrix network Matrix targets use cases like voice over IP, Internet of Things and instant messaging, including group communication, along with a longer-term goal to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web. The protocol supports security and replication, maintaining full conversation history, with no single points of control or failure. Existing communication services can integrate with the Matrix ecosystem. Client software is available for open- federated Instant Messaging (IM), voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT) communication. The Matrix standard specifies RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room’ on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room’. This data is signed using a git-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server’s private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows eventual consistency semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by re-synchronizing missing history from other participating servers. The Olm library provides for optional end-to-end encryption on a room-by-room basis via a Double Ratchet Algorithm implementation. It can ensure that conversation data at rest is only readable by the room participants. With it configured, data transmitted over Matrix is only visible as ciphertext to the Matrix servers, and can be decrypted only by authorized participants in the room. The Olm and Megolm (an expansion of Olm to better suit the need for bigger rooms) libraries have been subject of a cryptographic review by NCC Group, whose findings are publicly available, and have been addressed by the Matrix team. The review was sponsored by the Open Technology Fund.  Bridges  Matrix supports bridging messages from different chat applications into Matrix rooms. These bridges are programs that run on the server and communicate with the non-Matrix servers. Bridges can either be acting as puppets or relays, where in the former the individual users account is visibly posting the messages, and in the latter a bot posts the messages for non puppeteered user accounts. Currently there are official bridges for: *Gitter *IRC *Slack/Mattermost *XMPP Bridges for the following notable applications are maintained by the community: *Apple iMessage *Discord *Email *Facebook Messenger *Google Hangouts *GroupMe *Mastodon *RSS/Twitter feeds *Signal *Skype *Telegram *SMS *WeChat *Whatsapp  Clients  Element is the reference implementation of a client. Many other clients, bots, bridges, servers and other implementations of the Matrix protocol also exist.  Servers  Synapse is the reference implementation of a Matrix homeserver. There is a \\"second generation Matrix homeserver\\" called Dendrite being developed by the Matrix core team.

Since the 1980s, he has been the head of the Department of Art Ceramics at Ivan Trush Lviv State College of Decorative and Fine Arts.  Life  Taras Levkiv was born on June 25, 1940, in the village of Mala Berezovytsya, now located in Zbarazh Raion, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine. He is the son of Bohdan Andriyovych Levkiv (1912-1999) and Olha Ivanivna Levkiv (née Omelian) (1921-2013). In 1964 he graduated from Lviv College of applied arts named in I. Trush (Ceramics Department). There he met his teacher Taras Dragan, with whom he would go on to develop a close relationship and the two would go on to enjoy year's of true friendship. In 1971 he graduated from Lviv Institute of applied and decorative arts. At the end of 1970 there was his private student's exhibition in the town. The works he presented opened up new opportunities of an ancient method of potter's wheel, they had expressive ethnographic features. He made an acquaintance with Peteris Martinson at a workshop in Dzintari (Latvia). Since that time the artist's works has been evolving as if in two directions. The first one represents bold experiments in the area of free creation which is officially forbidden in sculpture. The second one is in his ability to incarnate and carry to the spectator his own social-political persuasion in original artistic form. In 1972 he became the first Representative from the Ukraine on ІІІ International biennale in Valorize (France). He would later go on to receive honors in competitions on artistic ceramics in Faience (Italy; 1974, 1978, 1979, 1980). In the 1980s T. Levkiv's range of artistic interests delved into another field. Levkiv began to give his priority to cosmological themes. He presented his works at 17 private exhibitions particularly in Tbilisi, Leningrad, Ternopil and other cities. The artist has taken part in 103 regional, all-Ukrainian and international exhibitions (Tartu, Estonia; Osaka, Japan; Zheshuv, Poland; Moscow, Russia etc). For over 20 years Taras Bohdanovych has headed the Ceramics Department in Lviv College of decorative and applied arts named in I. Trush. He was a Deputy of Lviv regional administration of the First Democratic Convocation. Over 10 years T. Levkiv has worked at public principles as a manager of projects at the construction in Vynnyky of Autocephalous Orthodox Church of the Saint Volodymyr and the Saint Olga. On ІІІ All-Ukrainian symposium of ceramics in Opshnae (1999) he got I honor for decorative plastic work \\"Bilomorcanal\\". Museums of Lviv, Ternopil, Tbilisi, the Saints- Petersburg, Berlin, Prague and other cities show to their visitors the artist's works. 2\\\\.

After the defeats of the Marathas in the first four invasions of Bengal (see Maratha invasions of Bengal), the Maratha General and ruler of Nagpur, Raghuji Bhonsle again invaded the territory of Bengal. Bhonsle, with 20,000 horsemen attacked the civilians of Murshidabad and moved onwards to Katwa. The Marathas met Alivardi Khan's army in Katwa and the battle had began. During the battle, most of the Marathas were slaughtered and the remainings Maratha soldiers under Raghuji Bhonsle retreated from Katwa. The Marathas then retreated towards Medinipur. The battle was a victory for Alivardi Khan who had once again ousted the Marathas from Bengal.

Decius was victorious, and Philip was killed. Decius then became Roman Emperor. Prelude Gothic tribes had attacked the Roman province of Moesia, on the frontier of the Danube River. The Roman troops there, led by Roman general Marinus Pacatianus held the Goths back and for the time being, secured the Roman defense of Moesia. In 248, Pacatianus' troops proclaimed him emperor. This made Pacatianus a usurper. Roman emperor Philip the Arab sent his trusted friend and general, Decius, to Moesia to put down the rebellion. Decius brought his son Herennius Etruscus with him. However, before Decius arrived, Pactianus's troops mutinied and assassinated their commander. When Decius arrived, he and Herennius attempted to restore order to the orphan army. The troops were tired of taking orders from a distant emperor. They proclaimed Decius emperor. Decius and his army then marched to Italy. Phillip, with only two reserve legions, marched to meet Decius in battle. Battle The two armies met in battle near Verona, Italy, in a bloody and brutal battle. Decius outnumbered Philip heavily. 6th century Byzantine writer Zosimus recorded the day: > \\"The supporters of Decius, though they knew the enemy had the imperial > forces, still retained their confidence in Decius, trusting his great skill > and prudence\\" Not many details of the battle are known, but Decius had better quality troops than Philip. Philip did not have much of a chance of victory. Emperor Philip himself was killed brutally by Decius. Philip's army was defeated. Decius had won a very easy victory.

While being superficially similar to the OM Lupetto, Leoncino, Daino, and Tigrotto, it was an all-new design - except for using the same doors as the earlier \\"zoological\\" series (thus called as they were all named after animals). The X-series was sold under a variety of other names as well, depending on the market. All but the two lightest models were replaced by the new Z-series in 1976, a design which briefly used OM badging but ended up being marketed exclusively as an Iveco. Development Developed by OM, it was offered with a variety of different engines and with many different badges. The smallest versions used Fiat's 8040 four-cylinder diesel engine, and were marketed as Fiats, OMs or Unics in France. Mid-range versions (sold as OM or OM-Saurer) used the larger OM CO3 four-cylinder, developed together with Saurer of Switzerland. The heaviest models received Fiat's six-cylinder 8060 engine and were sold as Fiats or Unics, and also as the OM N100. OM's versions were named with a two-digit code indicating gross tonnage ranging from the OM 35 to the 100, a system also used by Saurer on the versions they sold. The range was thus from . Fiat and Unic used the same numerical system followed by NC (for Nafta Cabinato, \\"diesel cab-over\\"). Magirus-Deutz sold this range under their brand after 1975 and used their own air-cooled engines for some models (55, 60, 75). In Austria, this truck was marketed as a Steyr- OM. The X-series was also built by Zastava, beginning in 1978. Kits for the 35-40 were also sent from Zastava's plant by Iveco for CKD-assembly in Kano, Nigeria, by a company called NTM. These trucks received Fiat badging, as this brand was considered strongest in Nigeria. The X-series cab was lightly facelifted a few years after its introduction, when the early metal grille was replaced by a black plastic unit with horizontal bars. The interior remained unchanged. \\"Iveco\\" badging also became more prominent after that company was founded on 1 January 1975. A more thorough redesign, with a new, more square cab, appeared in late 1976 and was called the OM Z-series. This replaced the earlier X lineup by 1977, although the Fiat 35/40 NC remained on sale until 1987 with the earlier cabin and it was built by Zastava in Yugoslavia into the early eighties.

This card is placed into the device, which then displays the voter's details. The voter places their thumb on the device, and their identity is confirmed through Fingerprint authentication. It usually takes about 10 to 20 seconds to validate a voter. On completion of accreditation process, a \\"Close V\\" key is used to complete the accreditation process and the total number of voters accredited can be previewed using a \\"Query\\" key. Afterwards, the result may be forwarded to INEC using the \\"Communication\\" key. The card reader was first used for Nigeria's presidential election held on March 28, 2015.

The band started as a side project, but ended up becoming a more serious and full- time band in their later years. Harm's Way has since released four studio albums: Reality Approaches (2009), Isolation (2011) and Rust (2015) and several EP's. On February 9, 2018, the band released their critically acclaimed Metal Blade Records debut, titled Posthuman. They have been recognized for their unique blend of metal, industrial, and hardcore music. History In 2006, the members of a straight edge punk band called Few and the Proud started a \\"side project-slash-joke\\" band to have fun playing short- and-fast powerviolence songs influenced by Crossed Out and Infest. Harm's Way drummer Chris Mills commented on the band's early days and progression, stating: \\"We'd play super fast powerviolence songs, and our singer would put on a mask and sing silly lyrics about beating up frat boys or whatever. Then, later as the band became more serious, we retired a lot of those elements and went in a more death metal direction—darker and less ridiculous, even if some aspects of it still weren't 100 percent serious.\\" Harm's Way released several albums, EPs and singles through Organized Crime Records and Closed Casket Activities in their early days. After the release of their 2011 second studio album Isolation, Harm's Way emailed Jacob Bannon (Converge) and his label Deathwish Inc. after hearing that he was a fan of the band's music to ask if the label would be interested in signing them. The band's signing to Deathwish was announced in March 2013. Harm's Way released the EP Blinded on July 23, 2013 featuring artwork by Florian Bertmer, and promoted it with a music video for the track \\"Mind Control\\" followed by a world tour. Mills commented on their positive relationship with the label, stating: \\"It's been awesome—they've been really helpful, we have a bigger budget, we were able to do a music video. They've been willing to do anything we've really wanted. They're really supportive.\\" The Blinded EP also saw the band incorporating more Godflesh-influenced industrial metal into their sound. Harm's Way released its third studio album Rust through Deathwish on March 10, 2015 and promoted it with a music video for the track \\"Amongst the Rust.\\" Commenting on the band's musical and imagery changes with Rust, Mills said: \\"We're still locked into these niches in people's minds—you know, meathead tough guy hardcore band, Satan-worshipping death metal band, whatever. We see Rust as not just a new musical phase—we're changing up the old logo and taking a different direction with the imagery to try to steer people away from generalizations and assumptions based on stuff that really doesn't represent who we are as people or musicians.\\" The album was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for Rock Sound, Chris Hidden gave the album an eight-out-of- ten, and said: \\"This new record finds them in formidable form, with the likes of 'Amongst The Rust' and 'Cancerous Ways' blending the down-tuned riff attack of nu metal with groove-led thrash and the crushing intensity of hardcore to produce a sound that references everyone from Sepultura to Trapped Under Ice.\\" Harm's Way began touring in support of Rust with a March/April 2015 North American tour with Code Orange and others, a May/June European tour, the European leg of Deathwish Fest and US headlining tour in July, and touring North American with The Black Dahlia Murder in October. On 6 December 2017, the band announced their fourth studio album, and Metal Blade Records debut, titled Posthuman. The record was set for release on 9 February 2018, and was produced by Will Putney at Graphic Nature Audio. After the album release and a February–March US tour, Luca Cimarusti wrote for the Chicago Reader, \\"...they’ve finally fully realized their fascination with [Godflesh]. ...Posthuman is one of the darkest, heaviest records you’ll hear this year.\\" A year later, Harm's Way released a four-song EP titled PSTHMN featuring industrial remixes of songs from Posthuman.

The Romans were victorious. Prelude In 250, the Goths, led by their king Cniva, attacked the Roman province of Moesia. Roman emperor Decius and his son Herennius Etruscus led their army to Moesia. The Goths were, at the same time, marching to attack the Roman city of Philippopolis. The Romans intercepted them near Nicopolis ad Istrum. Battle The Romans intercepted the Goths just before they could reach Nicopolis. Decius and Herennius launched a surprise attack on the Goths while they were marching. The Romans took the disorganized Goths by surprise, fighting hard and gaining the upper hand quickly. Caught off guard, the Goths could not respond to the attack, and so were defeated. 6th century Byzantine scholar Jordanes described Cniva's defeat: > \\"When the Emperor Decius drew near, Cniva, with his army still in good > shape, at last withdrew to the Balkan Mountains, which were not far > distant.\\" Aftermath The Romans defeated the Goths, but not decisively. Cniva's army marched in good order to besiege Philippopolis. Decius moved through the Shipka Pass to intercept him but was ambushed and heavily defeated by Cniva near Beroe at the Battle of Beroe.Goths in the 3rd Century Decius fled to Novae to link up with governor Trebonianus Gallus. Cniva mounted failed attacks on Philippopolis' walls and then negotiated a truce with the city's ambitious governor, Titus Julius Priscus. The Goths broke the truce, however, and sacked the city. In 251, Cniva defeated three Roman legions at the Battle of Abritus, and Decius and Herennius were both killed.

The actress auditioned for the role in Sydney and relocated to the city after winning the role. Her casting was announced a few days before her first appearance. The part of Phoebe marks Giovinazzo's first acting job and she commented that she was having fun developing her character. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 November 2013. Phoebe is portrayed as a feisty, strong, positive, singer and songwriter from Melbourne. Phoebe was introduced in the 2013 finale, as the former girlfriend of established character Kyle Braxton. Actor Nic Westaway was pleased that his character was getting a new love interest, while series producer Lucy Addario believed Phoebe would bring out a different side to him. Phoebe and Kyle's relationship was tested by the appearance of his \\"dark side\\", Mark Nicholson's (Steve Rodgers) attempts to break them up and a marriage proposal. Phoebe's burgeoning music career was brought to the forefront of storylines in November 2014 when Jolene Anderson joined the cast as Neive Devlin, a record producer who signs Phoebe to her label. At Phoebe's industry launch night, Neive had her assistant drug Phoebe and assault her on camera. Giovinazzo enjoyed portraying Phoebe's foray into the music industry. Shortly after, Phoebe became the focus of a darker storyline involving her fan Ryan Kelly (Daniel Webber), who stalked and kidnapped her. Phoebe was later paired with a new love interest, Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (George Mason), and learned she was pregnant with Kyle's twins, which she later miscarried. Following the end of her relationship with Ash, Phoebe was given a more mature love interest in the form of Justin Morgan (James Stewart). The couple became engaged, but ended their relationship when Phoebe left to tour the United States on 11 May 2017. Casting On 24 November 2013, Meg Drewett from Digital Spy reported that actress Isabella Giovinazzo had joined the cast of Home and Away as new character Phoebe Nicholson. Giovinazzo successfully auditioned for the role in Sydney, where the show is filmed. Giovinazzo had to sing in front of actor Nic Westaway during the audition, before they were paired together to do some slow-dancing. Giovinazzo relocated to Sydney from Melbourne. She spent five months on the set filming, before her casting was announced. She admitted to having difficulty keeping her new role a secret, saying \\"I wasn't able to really tell anyone back home about it or why I moved (to Sydney). But it's nice now being able to share exactly why I disappeared for a few months.\\" The part marks Giovinazzo's first acting job, following a career in film making. Of joining Home and Away, Giovinazzo stated \\"It's been a lot of fun. I'm still figuring out what to do. Phoebe's been a really great person to start with. Just developing her character and rounding this woman has been wonderful and I've got a lot to play with because she's a little bit kooky.\\" Giovinazzo admitted that she was nervous ahead of filming her first scene in front of hundreds of extras. Actress Jessica Grace Smith also auditioned for the role of Phoebe. She was later cast as Denny Miller. In October 2014, Giovinazzo admitted that she was attending acting classes to help her with emotional scenes, after she had difficulty acting out Phoebe's vulnerable moments. Development Introduction and characterisation Phoebe was introduced in the 2013 finale, as the ex-girlfriend of Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway). She is a singer and songwriter, who grew up with Kyle in Melbourne and was \\"brokenhearted\\" when he moved away. Phoebe came to Summer Bay after learning Kyle was staging a music festival in the area. Giovinazzo explained that the festival gave Phoebe an opportunity to see Kyle for the first time since he left her. She wanted to see if there was anything still between them as they had a long-term relationship that was important to them both. Giovinazzo said, \\"Kyle and Phoebe know each other inside out. They just click together.\\" Phoebe offered to help Kyle and Tamara Kingsley (Kelly Paterniti) plan the event and perform with the band. During Phoebe's performance, Kyle joined her on stage for a duet, which made Tamara jealous. Phoebe also caught Chris Harrington's (Johnny Ruffo) attention. Ahead of her arrival, Giovinazzo called Phoebe a positive person, who liked to have fun. She explained, \\"she's a blast. She's this sort of blend of blunt, cool-cat, serious kid and a burst of erratic energy.\\" Giovinazzo later branded the character \\"impulsive\\" and \\"mischievous\\" and said she had a feistiness about her. While the official website dubbed her \\"strong and focussed\\", adding that if she wants something she will go after it. Giovinazzo agreed, saying that Phoebe likes getting what she wants. Giovinazzo enjoys portraying Phoebe's fun side, as it gives her a chance to see \\"joy in everything\\". She also admitted to sharing some similarities with her character; they were both born in Melbourne and they like music. But Giovinazzo said that she was not \\"an avid musician\\" like Phoebe. Giovinazzo added that unlike Phoebe, she was not a trained singer and she just sang when she was told to. The actress stated that she shared a lot of similarities with Phoebe, including her positive, outgoing and creative sides. Giovinazzo also said Phoebe was \\"very outspoken and very adventurous\\". In March 2016, Giovinazzo told Colin Vickery of news.com.au that due to everything Phoebe had gone through during her time in the Bay, she had changed and had become more grown up. Giovinazzo commented, \\"she has moved on from wanting to be a pop star and she is teaching now.\\" Relationship with Kyle Braxton Nic Westaway plays Kyle Braxton, Phoebe's first love interest in the show. Westaway was pleased that his character would be embarking on a new relationship, after being involved in a love triangle with Tamara and his brother Casey (Lincoln Younes). Westaway commented that Phoebe and Kyle had a strong connection while they lived in Melbourne and noted that there was \\"still a real spark\\" between them. He thought they would have to get on the same page, as Phoebe made Kyle question who he wanted to be. Series producer Lucy Addario believed Phoebe would bring out a different side to \\"the brooding\\" Kyle and mix up life in the Braxton world. Addario agreed with Westaway's assessment of Kyle and Phoebe's relationship, saying they would have to work out some issues from their past, but they would \\"quickly reignite the spark they shared.\\" She added that the couple \\"sizzle\\" on-screen. When Phoebe became disturbed by Kyle's \\"dark side\\" and his involvement with various Braxton dramas, she wanted him to tell her how he turned into such a violent person. Kyle opened up to her about how he kidnapped Casey and tried to kill him and Tamara, which left Phoebe scared. While Kyle felt like he had put that incident behind him with the help of his brothers, Phoebe did not understand. She then told Kyle that she was moving back to Melbourne and that she wanted him to come with her, believing that if he was away from his family he would like his old self again. Westaway told an Inside Soap reporter that Kyle wanted to be with Phoebe, as she brought out his passionate side which he missed. Phoebe reminded him of how he used to be. Kyle and Phoebe declared their love for each other, but Phoebe admitted that she no longer wanted to be around his brothers. After Phoebe decided to stay in Summer Bay with Kyle, her father Mark Nicholson (Steve Rodgers) came to meet him. Westaway explained that Kyle could see how much it meant to Phoebe that they got along. The meeting went well, until Mark learned some interesting information about Kyle and changed his outlook \\"pretty quickly\\". Westaway hoped it would not cause a rift between Kyle and Phoebe, as she was a good influence on him. Mark later offered Kyle a bribe to stop dating his daughter, but Kyle refused to take the money, insisting that it was an insult as Phoebe was worth more. Mark then upped his offer to $100,000, but Kyle refused the money again. In a bid to keep Phoebe away from the Braxtons, Mark then reported the family for \\"dodgy dealings\\" to the police. After the police came away empty handed, someone fired a gun into the house, almost hitting Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) and Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen). Peacocke commented that Brax was aware that Mark had connections to the underworld and wanted to keep Phoebe away from Kyle. After the shooting, Kyle was worried about Phoebe's safety and got her to leave the Bay for a few days. Westaway commented \\"He's very protective of Phoebe.\\" After realising that she did not want to live in fear, Phoebe returned to be by Kyle's side. Shortly after someone broke into the house and Kyle was attacked. After he recovered, Kyle spotted his attacker with Phoebe's father and realised that Mark was behind the attempt on his life. Kyle tried to keep the truth from Phoebe, but after she found out he was forced to apologise. Phoebe then threatened to go to the police about her father, but Kyle and Casey talked her out of it. When Kyle displayed his aggressive side again, Phoebe was left worrying about the future of their relationship. After Kyle refused to take a day off work to write music with her, Phoebe used her manipulative streak to start \\"pushing Kyle's buttons\\". She asked Matt Page (Alec Snow) to listen to her song at the restaurant and then invited him to her place to write with her, which infuriated Kyle. A TV Soap writer observed, \\"Kyle's rage stuns Phoebe and is her first hint that there might be something fundamentally wrong with their relationship.\\" Kyle was surprised that Phoebe asked Matt to be her song writing partner simply because he had to work. Ignoring her concerns about Kyle, Phoebe asked Matt if she could post their song on her website, but when he insulted her work Kyle got physically aggressive with Matt. A frightened Phoebe sought comfort and advice from Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith). Kyle later apologised to Phoebe and she apologised for trying to manipulate him but she was still \\"rattled\\" by Kyle's display of anger. She told him that if he could not deal with his issues, they would not have a future together. When Kyle developed a serious throat injury, he was told he could not sing anymore. Phoebe then decided that she too would not sing, until Kyle was better. said it was Phoebe's way of letting Kyle know they were in it together. When Kyle organised an after party for the Bay's Colour Run, he chose Matt to be the musical entertainment, however after Matt failed to turn up, Kyle convinced Phoebe to take his place. Giovinazzo commented that the festive spirit also persuaded Phoebe to change her mind and once she began singing, she was \\"in her element\\". Kyle then proposed to Phoebe on the balcony at Angelo's in front of everyone. Phoebe was in \\"total disbelief\\" as Kyle knew that she was not keen on marriage and settling down. She turned his proposal down and left the balcony. Phoebe then spent the night at Ricky's and she and Kyle argued. When asked if there was any hope of salvaging their romance, Giovinazzo told an Inside Soap columnist \\"Phoebe would like to try, because she's not ready to give up on their relationship. But I don't think she truly understands the 'in it for the long haul' sentiment just yet – in any respect!\\" Music career In November 2014, Jolene Anderson joined the cast as Neive Devlin, a record producer who comes to the Bay to see Phoebe perform, after hearing her music on her website. Anderson commented, \\"Neive is on the prowl for up and coming young things and Phoebe is one of them.\\" Neive loved Phoebe's \\"rock chick\\" attitude and told her that she would be \\"music's next big thing\\", which caused tension between Phoebe and Kyle. After attending a recording session in the city, Phoebe returned to the Bay with a new wardrobe and a more pop sound. Westaway said Kyle was very wary of what was happening to Phoebe and the avenue she was going down. Unlike Phoebe, Kyle did not trust Neive and believed that she did not have Phoebe's best interests at heart. He also did not like the contract she offered Phoebe, as it gave her very little control over her career. Westaway added that Kyle's biggest concern was that Phoebe was selling out. However, Brax sided with Phoebe, claiming the recording contract was a \\"once- in-a-lifetime opportunity\\" and she would be foolish to turn it down. Neive later arranged an industry launch night in the city for Phoebe. However, Phoebe was \\"blissfully\\" unaware that Neive was planning something more sinister for her, as she was focused on her potential music career. While Phoebe was preparing for her set, Neive's assistant, Grant Barnes (Adam Gray) asked her if she wanted Phoebe to perform, and when Neive said no, he spiked Phoebe's drink. Neive then insisted that Phoebe drink the champagne, which left her incapacitated and with no idea what was going on. Grant then tried to undress and assault Phoebe while they were being filmed. Phoebe was rescued by Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) and Martin Ashford (George Mason), but Grant told Neive that they had enough footage to post online. Giovinazzo summed up Phoebe's short-lived music career: \\"Phoebe lives and breathes music and believes it can change the world. She was then introduced to the media- inclined industry, fought for what she believed in, but was ultimately pulled into the machine.\\" Giovinazzo enjoyed the storyline, calling it a \\"wonderful journey to play\\". Stalker In early 2015, Phoebe became the centre of a dark storyline involving a stalker. Shortly after the video of Phoebe looking like \\"a crazed party animal\\" was posted online, Ryan Kelly (Daniel Webber) turned up in Summer Bay looking for her. Ryan watched and followed Phoebe, before leaving her a tiara and a rose for her outside the Braxton's house. Ryan later came face-to-face with Phoebe and told her he was a huge fan of her music. Giovinazzo commented that Ryan seemed \\"quite strange\\", while TV Week's Stephen Downie noted that he was after more than Phoebe's autograph. Ryan later entered Phoebe's home, knowing she was alone. Phoebe tried to act calm and gave Ryan some CDs in a bid to get him to leave. However, Ryan persisted and told Phoebe that he wanted to take her to his house so she could focus on her music. Giovinazzo explained that Phoebe was \\"freaking out\\" as she knew Kyle was not around to help her. After Ryan refused to leave, Phoebe screamed for help, attracting the attention of her neighbour John Palmer (Shane Withington), who chased Ryan away. Phoebe was relieved when Kyle returned home and she decided to keep the incident with Ryan a secret, but she was soon forced to tell Kyle what had happened. Ryan was later spotted in the Bay by Katarina Chapman (Pia Miller), who warned him to leave, and Kyle, who threatened him. However, when Ryan learned Phoebe and the rest of the Braxtons were out for the day, he gained entry to the house and placed a camera in Phoebe's bedroom. Later, when Ryan noticed Phoebe was home alone, he broke in again and waited for Phoebe behind the door. When she entered the room, Ryan came up behind her and placed a cloth soaked in chloroform over her mouth, before kidnapping her. Ryan tied Phoebe to a chair and told her he wanted to save her. He forced her to change into a white dress and take off her make-up. Giovinazzo commented, \\"Phoebe struggles and screams, but no-one can hear her.\\" Ryan wanted to take Phoebe back to the person she was before her failed music career and he made Phoebe sing for him. During her performance, Phoebe kicked Ryan in the groin and was rescued by Kyle and the police. Kat later told Phoebe that Ryan has been sentenced to seven years in prison. Relationship with Martin Ashford and pregnancy When Kyle told Phoebe he wanted them to get back together, she rejected him, as she believed he was still grieving for his brother. She later spoke with Ash about people being in a hurry to get serious in relationships, leading him to try and prove to her that he felt the same way. Ash challenged Phoebe to go skinny dipping, and an Inside Soap reporter noted that they seemed to have \\"a great time\\" splashing around in the water. Phoebe decided to make things more interesting by stealing Ash's clothes, forcing him to return to the caravan park naked. When Ash saw Phoebe coming out of the shower block, he tried to take her towel, but ended up pulling her to the ground with him. Both Phoebe and Ash realised that there was an attraction between them, but feeling \\"awkward\\" they both returned to their respective vans unable to admit it out loud. The following day, Phoebe reunited with Kyle and he invited her to move back in with him. A \\"disappointed\\" Ash then questioned Phoebe about her change of heart. Phoebe broke up with Kyle again after admitting she had feelings for Ash. When Phoebe and Ash teamed up to try to find a grieving Ricky, they grew closer and almost kissed. After Ash found Ricky and returned to the Bay, he and Phoebe eventually kissed and had sex in the back of his car, despite her reservations about the timing. Both Kyle and Ash's ex-girlfriend Denny reacted badly to Phoebe and Ash's new relationship. Kyle believed Ash was being disloyal, while a confrontation between Denny and Phoebe turned physical. Denny tried to help Kyle by taking him out dancing, but the following day he decided to temporarily leave town. A couple of weeks later, Denny found a positive pregnancy test in the bin. She initially assumed it belonged to house mate Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth), but Phoebe eventually admitted that it was hers. Giovinazzo explained that Phoebe did not want anyone to know she was pregnant until she had made a decision about the baby, but she was happy to have Denny and Hannah's support. Giovinazzo said, \\"These women always look after each other – Denny puts her history with Phoebe's boyfriend Ash aside, and Hannah, who's a nurse, helps out from a medical perspective.\\" Giovinazzo was pleased to receive the storyline, and she told Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz: \\"I just read it in the script. It was a new aspect of the character and of myself to discover so I was really excited.\\" On-screen, Phoebe was unsure who the father of her baby was. Giovinazzo thought Ash would make a good father, but Phoebe did not know if he wanted children, while Kyle wanted to be a father, but it would put everyone in an awkward position if he was. Phoebe decided to find out who the father was through a paternity test. Both Kyle and Ash were already at the hospital, recovering from surgery, as Ash gave a kidney to Kyle. Ash was upset when he overheard Phoebe telling Kyle that he would make a better father, so Phoebe decided that they should sit down and make some ground rules. When they all began to argue, a stressed out Phoebe suddenly collapsed in pain. When the results from the paternity test came back, Westaway commented \\"There is no situation that will appease all of them. It just has to play out. They have to deal with the fallout, whatever it might be.\\" He also said that Kyle would want to reunite with Phoebe if the baby was his, as he always wanted a family. Kyle was revealed to be the father and Phoebe tried to assure Ash that they could make their situation work, but he ended their relationship instead. Phoebe and Ash later reunited, while Kyle and Ash decided to set \\"aside their differences\\" and support Phoebe. During an ultrasound, Phoebe learns that she had been pregnant with twins, but one had died. She was then informed that the surviving baby had a congenital heart defect and would be unlikely to live long past birth. Phoebe is advised to have an abortion, and Giovinazzo said that it was \\"a hard decision for her to make\\". Phoebe opted not to terminate her pregnancy, but shortly after, she suffered a miscarriage. Giovinazzo described the pregnancy storyline as \\"tumultuous\\". She also thought that Phoebe's personality had been affected by everything she endured, stating \\"This question of family has changed her. She has grown a lot as a character and started to consider things that are very new to her.\\" Giovinazzo added that Phoebe was prepared to care for another person, which was a big change. Phoebe eventually ended her relationship with Ash. When he wakes with no recollection of the night before and a strange woman in his flat, he admits to Billie that he thinks he cheated on Phoebe. The woman eventually returned to speak with him and he became convinced that he had cheated, so he told Phoebe, who walked away from him. Relationship with Justin Morgan In a March 2016 interview with Colin Vickery of news.com.au, Giovinazzo commented that there would be a potential new love interest for Phoebe coming up. She also described it as \\"maybe a more mature love.\\" Two months later, the Morgan siblings were introduced to Home and Away and Phoebe had a one-night stand with Justin Morgan (James Stewart), after meeting him on the beach. As they continued to get to know each other, Stewart said that Justin was developing feelings for Phoebe and was certain that she felt the same way. He continued, \\"Phoebe keeps doing things that make him know she digs him.\\" Phoebe and Justin were later threatened by Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery), who was working for a drugs syndicate that were after the Morgans. He demands that Phoebe and Justin look through several boxes for a book detailing the syndicate's activities. Justin wants to get Phoebe out of harm's way, but neither of them are willing to \\"detach\\". Stewart commented, \\"she desperately wants to help Justin and Justin doesn't want to lose her.\\" Spike leaves and warns Justin that he will hurt anyone close to Justin if he does not get the book. After Phoebe is carjacked by Simmo (James O'Connell), she becomes depressed, so Justin decides to cheer her up by singing to her at Salt. Phoebe joins him to perform a duet and they later share a kiss. Giovinazzo commented, \\"Phoebe can't deny that she has strong and deep feelings for Justin. They're just drawn to each other.\\" However, with Justin's family still in danger from a gang of criminals, Giovinazzo said Phoebe had to be smart about the situation. Shortly after Phoebe moves in with Justin and his siblings, Justin proposes to her. Phoebe initially rejects the proposal, as she feels she is not \\"a marriage kind of gal\\". But after talking things through with Justin, she accepts. Departure In March 2017, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy reported that Phoebe could be the next character to leave the show. On-screen, Phoebe receives a visit from her friend Donna Fields (Melissa Bonne), who reignites Phoebe's interest in the music industry. Donna offers Phoebe a job as her opening act. Phoebe is initially unsure about accepting the offer, as she is aware that it could be extended for months, but Justin encourages her to go. Shortly after returning, Phoebe reveals she has been offered a year long contract to tour the United States. Justin decides to go with her, but his daughter Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas) arrives in the Bay unexpectedly. Phoebe eventually decides to leave without him, and she made her last appearance on 11 May 2017. Giovinazzo later confirmed that she had decided to leave the show to pursue new roles. When asked if there was a chance she would return to Home and Away, Giovinazzo said \\"Never say never! I love what I'm doing now, but Phoebe left town – she didn't die – so there's always a chance [of coming back].\\" Reception At the 2015 TV Week and Soap Extra #OMGAwards Phoebe and Ash won the Best Shock Kiss category, while Phoebe, Ash and Kyle won Best Love Triangle. Ahead of Phoebe's on-screen arrival, Ash from Pedestrian.tv thought that her introduction might have been \\"a belated reply\\" to a pop culture reference made by rival soap opera Neighbours. He called Phoebe \\"a new cool cat Summer Bay resident\\" and a \\"free- spirited indie musician and possible home-wrecker\\". As Phoebe and Kyle performed at the festival, a reporter for the Sunday Mail observed that \\"the chemistry between them is palpable.\\" A Sun-Herald contributor was not a fan of Phoebe, branding her \\"one of H&A;'s more annoying characters\\". When Phoebe debuted her new pop look, TV Week's Stephen Downie observed \\"Phoebe looks so hot she could melt tarmac at an Alaskan airport.\\" When Phoebe was later asked to go on tour and leave Kyle behind, TV Week columnists Holly Richards and Bianca La Cioppa debated whether she should give up love or her career. Richards wanted Phoebe to leave, saying that she needed to get her \\"head out of the clouds\\" and not throw away the opportunity of a lifetime for a boy. Richards commented \\"Honestly, I thought Phoebe was a lot smarter than this.\\" La Cioppa thought Phoebe would be making the right choice if she stayed for Kyle, explaining \\"One, because I'd hate to see them break up (they're my fave H&A; couple!). Two, because they have years of history behind them that everyone tends to forget.\\" In February 2015, an Inside Soap contributor observed, \\"Rock chick Phoebe is quite a handful\\". Of Phoebe and Justin's romance, a writer for TV Week stated, \\"They're on. They're off. It's hard to keep up with Justin (James Stewart) and Phoebe's (Isabella Giovinazzo) relationship.\\" Ali Cromarty of TV Week noted that \\"ever since they first locked eyes, the chemistry between Justin and Phoebe has been palpable.\\" References External links *Phoebe Nicholson at the Official AU Home and Away website Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Fictional stalking victims Category:Fictional guitarists Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Phoebe Nicholson"},{"id":"46247221","text":"Celine Byrne (born May 3, 1980 in Kildare)\\"Celine Byrne\\", opera- online.com\\"Celine Byrne\\", Irish National Opera is an Irish soprano.

Originally a policeman, he joined the anti-Japanese resistance during World War II, and the anti-French Lao Issara from 1946–1949. He subsequently joined the nascent RLA, and went on to serve the Kingdom of Laos until just prior to his death in 1973. Background The colonial army in the French Protectorate of Laos was one of Lao recruits and French officers and non-commissioned officers. Those few Lao promoted out of the ranks rose no further than command of a company. After the Kingdom of Laos gained its freedom in 1953, the few Lao with military experience were speedily promoted to much higher command positions than they were accustomed to. Many officers were also commissioned into the upper ranks from civilian life; they tended to gain their posts through family influence rather than training or ability. The few urban elite families who dominated Lao society felt it advantageous to have family members or friends in the military command.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 11–13. Early life and colonial service Sing Rattanasamay was born in Vientiane, the French Protectorate of Laos, in 1912, and was educated there. He served originally as a non-commissioned officer in the colonial Garde Indigene (Indigenous Guard) police force in the French Protectorate of Laos prior to World War II. In October 1945, Sing joined the Lao Issara independence movement; he was given command of the civil guard in Vientiane. He was subsequently appointed as the original Lao Issara defense minister by Prince Phetsarath. However, Prince Souphanouvong claimed the post of commander-in-chief of the Lao Issara Army for the Liberation and Defense of Laos, which led to conflict with Sing. In November 1945, Sing was wounded in fighting on the Plain of Jars and sidelined to convalesce. Dissension within the Lao Issara led to Sing's dismissal in November 1948. After the Lao Issara disbanded and an amnesty declared for its participants in October 1949, Sing returned to Laos and joined the French-run Armée Nationale Laotienne (Laotian National Army) to restart his military career. In spring 1953, Captain Sing was the first Laotian appointed to battalion command. After the French cadres rotated home, Major Sing was promoted to command of Military Region 3 in early 1955.Conboy, Morrison, p. 14.Stuart-Fox, pp. 118, 300–301. Service for the Kingdom of Laos His early participation in the Laotian Civil War is unknown. However, when General Phoumi Nosavan took charge of the nation in December 1959, Sing backed him.Conboy, Morrison, p. 25. When Captain Kong Le captured the capital in his coup, Sing was there. He declared for the coup. His status in Phoumi's December 1960 counter-coup is unknown.Conboy, Morrison, p. 33. On 5 May 1961, Sing was entrusted as leader of a ceasefire delegation to the Pathet Lao communists. In a meeting located between Vientiane and the Plain of Jars at Ban Namone, Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 27 March 2015. it was agreed that the International Control Commission from the 1954 Geneva accords would be revived to police the truce. By 4 May, the ICC was arriving in Laos. During the ceasefire, the Royal Lao Government, the Pathet Lao, and the Forces Armées Neutralistes (FAN) of Kong Le would meet to negotiate terms of a coalition government.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 54–55.

Williams was something of a journeyman throughout his busking career, but he lived in Philadelphia for most of his life. Much of his repertoire consisted of sanctified gospel songs and pre-war country blues standards. In 1961, Williams had a recording session with the record producer Pete Welding, the results of which were later released on a compilation album. Little is known about Williams's personal life. According to Welding's notes, Williams was born in Florida sometime in 1915. His parents were migrant workers. As a teenager, he attended the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind in St. Augustine, where he developed a sophisticated understanding of harmony and proficiency as a guitarist. He began his career as a street performer in the 1930s. In 1935, Williams settled in Philadelphia. He frequently traveled to Harlem, where he performed alongside Reverend Gary Davis. Williams could play blues standards, folk songs, and some pop tunes, but he told Welding in 1961 that he preferred playing spirituals, because he enjoyed them and \\"the police rarely would bother him if he confined himself to this sort of material\\". The Piedmont blues guitarist Frank Hovington, another musician who occasionally teamed up with Williams in Philadelphia in the 1940s, recalled that Williams was \\"more at home\\" performing spirituals, as he sang in a gospel quartet at an African Methodist Episcopal church in Frederick, Maryland. In 1961, when Williams was residing in a predominantly black neighborhood on Lombard Street in Philadelphia, Welding observed his performance of sanctified numbers with accordion accompaniment. After striking up a friendship with the producer, Williams explained that he had begun to play the accordion for its audibility, while also limiting his physical activity, both important characteristics for the aging musician. For the recording sessions he agreed to participate with Welding at radio station WHYY on May 5, 1961. Welding bought him a guitar, and Williams reacquainted himself with it. The influence of Reverend Davis is evident throughout the 23 numbers recorded, but Williams had his own style, marked by bass string slapping and bottleneck techniques. None of the recordings were released at the time; however, 16 of the songs were compiled on the album Blind Connie Williams: Traditional Blues, Spirituals and Folksongs in 1974 on Welding's Testament Records. Williams' best-known song, his early 1930s rendition of a song that was adopted by Thomas A. Dorsey's \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\" was performed in a traditional eight-bar blues format, which was his preferred style. Not much is known about Williams following his sessions with Welding, although he was still living in Philadelphia by 1974. In 1995, his album, retitled Philadelphia Street Singer, was distributed, with seven tracks from the 1961 sessions that were not included on the 1974 version.

These types of rotisseries have proven quite functional for cooking rotisserie-style chicken.Gisslen, Wayne; (et al.) (2006) Professional Cooking, for Canadian Chefs. John Wiley & Sons. 9. 47. Leftover rotisserie chicken may be used in a variety of dishes such as soup, chicken salad, and sandwiches. United States In the United States, ready-to-eat rotisserie chickens were available in supermarkets and some butcher shops during much of the twentieth century. However, they did not become a widely available option for consumers until the early 1990s, when Boston Market helped popularize the selling of packaged rotisserie chickens. Rotisserie chickens are now highly popular. In 2010, 600 million rotisserie-cooked chickens were purchased by consumers \\"in U.S. supermarkets, club stores and similar retail outlets.\\" In 2018, over 900 million rotisserie chickens were sold by foodservice outlets and retail stores. Rotisserie chickens are often lower in price than raw whole chickens. Two explanations are often given to justify this phenomenon. First, some grocery stores may use rotisserie chickens as loss leaders to bring shoppers into the store. The logic behind this theory is that if customers come to a store for its rotisseries chickens, they will buy other products while they are there, too. Second, rotisserie chickens are often made with poultry that is about to reach its \\"best by\\" date. By cooking and selling the chickens, the grocery stores are able to recoup some of their expenditures. In the U.S., chickens used for rotisserie cooking may be injected with brine to retain moisture. Additional ingredients may be used to add flavor and to brown the chicken, such as oleoresin, yeast extract, sodium tripolyphosphate, and natural flavorings.  Costco and rotisserie chickens  Costco is one of the largest producers and vendors of rotisserie chickens in the United States, with one commentator describing it as \\"the undisputed king of rotisserie chickens.\\" In 2017, Costco sold approximately 87 million rotisserie chickens in the United States. Costco's CFO, Richard Galanti, has repeatedly rebuffed suggestions that Costco might eventually increase the cost of its chickens above $4.99, which has been the price of a Costco rotisserie chicken since 2009. In 2017, Costco broke ground on a new 414-acre facility in Fremont, Nebraska that would include a hatchery, feed mill, and processing plant. The facility – which is expected to produce around 100 million chickens per year, or roughly 40 percent of Costco's needs – has been reported as costing between $275 million and $400 million. The plant is scheduled to open in September 2019. In other cultures  Canada  Rotisserie chicken has been a popular food in Canada since the 1950s, and is a staple of Canadian pop culture. Two Canadian casual dining restaurant chains, Swiss Chalet and St- Hubert dominate the market for chicken, though the dish is also the central item for other Canadian chains, popular international chains such as Nandos, or individual restaurants. Rotisserie chicken is available at most supermarkets. Swiss Chalet owns a cable channel that exclusively airs content related to rotisserie chicken, \\"twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\\" It typically airs chickens rotating on a rotisserie. Occasionally, a dancing man appears wearing a costume that looks \\"like a container of Swiss Chalet's dipping sauce.\\"  France  Napoleon Bonaparte was a frequent consumer of rotisserie chickens.

Shortly afterwards, in 1729, the old stave church was torn down and replaced by a new timber-framed church on the same site. In 1873, the parish purchased the church back from private ownership at a cost of 615 Norwegian speciedaler. In 1885, the church was torn down and a new church was built to replace it. The new church was constructed about to the southwest of the old church site. This new church was consecrated on 25 November 1885 by the Bishop Waldemar Hvoslef.

The region is known for its historical significance as a major economic and industrial center in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Geography Patapsco Valley Watershed MapThe Patapsco Valley follows the Patapsco River, a major river flowing into the Chesapeake Bay. The valley is mostly wooded with various steep elevations as the valley travels north. The valley begins in Elkridge Landing and runs north through a number of mill town communities until the river splits into two segments. Liberty Dam and its reservoir, located on the North Branch, is a major component of the Baltimore city water system. Besides Baltimore, the river also flows past Ellicott City (the county seat of Howard County) and Elkridge. The South Branch of the river flows east from its source in Marriottsville, Maryland. Patapsco Valley State Park is adjacent to of the Patapsco and its branches, encompassing a total of in five different areas. The river cuts a gorge 100–200 feet (35–70 m) deep within the park, which features rocky cliffs and tributary waterfalls. The valley contains the communities of Catonsville, Ellicott City, Elkridge, Woodstock, Daniels, Hanover, and many others. The valley is drained by the Patapsco River and its tributaries.  History  View of the valley from Ellicott City John Smith was the first European to explore the river noting it on his 1612 map as the Bolus River. The \\"Red river\\", was named after the clay color, and is considered the \\"old Bolus\\", as other branches were also labelled Bolus on maps. As the river was not navigable beyond Elkridge, it was not a major path of commerce with only one ship listed as serving the northern branch, and four others operating around the mouth in 1723. The Patapsco valley was used as the route of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's original main line west constructed from 1829 onwards, and this route remains, though much altered. Many old railroad bridges were constructed in the valley, most notably the Thomas Viaduct and the Patterson Viaduct, of which ruins remain. Flour mills and a hydropower dam were formerly powered by the river. The valley is prone to flooding, though at long intervals. Modern floods include one in 1868 that washed away 14 houses killing 39 around Ellicott City. A 1923 flood topped bridges. In 1952 an eight-foot wall of water swept the shops of Ellicott City and a 1956 flood inflicted heavy damage at the Bartigis Brothers plant. In 1972, Ellicott City and the Old Main Line railroad sustained serious damage as a result of rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Agnes. During the 2010s, Ellicott City was impacted by two significant flood events in 2016 and 2018. These flood events were also due to significant rainfall, in which stormwater overflowed from the Tiber River and Hudson Branch tributaries of the Patapsco River. Due to much of Main Street being built on top of the natural course of the Tiber River, the stormwater was forced to exit via the Main Street channel into the Patapsco during both storms. Many in the community cite the high amount of impervious surface and overdevelopment throughout greater Ellicott City to be a contributing issue to these types of floods. The mouth of the Patapsco River forms Baltimore harbor, the site of the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. This is where Francis Scott Key, while aboard a British ship, wrote \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" a poem later set to music as the national anthem of the United States. Today, a red, white, and blue buoy marks the spot where was anchored. Wildlife Patapsco Valley is considered to be a major hub for wildlife in Central Maryland. In fact, it is noted as habitat hub and corridor by the Howard County Green infrastructure network. Conservation efforts have been made to protect this status through preservation easements along the Patapsco Valley State Park interface. The headquarters of the Howard County Conservancy is located in the upper valley in the town of Woodstock. The valley is home to typical flora and fauna found in Central Maryland. Numerous sightings of the American black bear have been reported in the state park and surrounding area. In 2016, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police filmed a sighting in Catonsville, Maryland.

The 1950 Arbitration Act has now been repealed in its entirety in the United Kingdom. The last remaining parts of the Act which were in force were repealed by the Arbitration Act, 1996. There are three schools of thought in relation to the proper interpretation of the provisions. * The first, and most popular, is the more purposive interpretation is that the words \\"as amended from time to time\\" should be construed broadly, and that the references to the 1950 Act should be construed as references to the statute that replaced it: the Arbitration Act, 1996. * The second is that the repeal of the various provisions of the 1950 Act means that de facto there is no longer any statute regulating arbitration in Anguilla. * The third is that an absolute interpretation should be taken, and that \\"amendment\\" should be limited to amendments, and does not include either repeal or re-enactment. Accordingly, although the provisions were repealed in the United Kingdom they were not amended, and therefore should be treated as still being in force in Anguilla.

In 1861, the church was torn down and replaced with a new church on the same site. The new church was consecrated on 13 October 1861.

At the age of seven he was admitted to the Benedictine abbey of La Trinità della Cava in Cava de' Tirreni and on 6 November 1849 he became part of the cloistered community there. He studied at the school of the Santissima Trinità of Cava de' Tirreni and was named as a novice of Montacassino on 15 August 1859. Bonazzi specialised in the study of Ancient Greek and Latin. On 19 December 1863 he was ordained at Naples by Bishop Tommaso Michele Salzano. He graduated from his studies on 12 December 1865 at the University of Naples. As a philosopher, orator and writer he was member of several academies and cultural associations. On 27 November 1872 Bonazzi was named professor of the University of Naples, but he refused the position, preferring the school of Badia cavense, which he put in charge of in 1878, as its prefect. Bonazzi's principle interest was pedagogy. He sought to reform the system of Greek teaching in schools. He was the author of numerous scholarly texts, which inspired new methods of teaching. One of his works was commended by the 7th Italian Pedagogical congress. His most important work, which received acclaim across Europe, remains the Dizionario greco-italiano, which was in print from 1880 to 1927 with twenty-five editions, by the publishers, Morano di Napoli. Simultaneously, Bonazzi's ecclesiastical career continued. In 1892 he became Vicar general of the diocese of Badia Cavense. At the death of the abbot Michele Morcaldi, on 7 March 1894, Pope Leo XIII appointed him abbot of the Cavense monastery. Subsequently, at the death of cardinal Donato Maria Dell'Olio, archbishop of Benevento, Leo XIII consecrated him as the replacement, on 9 June 1902. On 11 June he was ordained at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and he took possession of the archdiocese of Benevento on 24 August. After around thirteen years of episcopal government and a final Lenten sermon, Bonazzi fell ill and died during the vigil for his elevation to the rank of cardinal, which Pope Benedict XV had ordained for him. He was buried in the church of St Clementina at Benevento.

It is located west-northwest of Watertown, South Dakota and lies entirely within Codington County and the Coteau des Prairies. The lake is naturally shaped and the most urban developed lake in South Dakota with approximately of residential shoreline. Lake Kampeska is connected to the Big Sioux River through a single inlet-outlet channel located on the northeast side. It is the third largest natural lake within the borders of South Dakota. Lake Kampeska is well-known for its depictions in art from wildlife and nature artists such as Terry Redlin, John Greene, John Wilson, and Joshua Spies. Lake Kampeska is perhaps featured most prominently in the artworks of Terry Redlin and are displayed in the Redlin Art Center nearby in Watertown, South Dakota.  History  John C. Fremont arrived in the area in 1838. It is known in the expressive language of the Dakotas as Lake Kampeska, signifying the \\"Lake of the Shining Shells.\\"Andreas, A. T. (Alfred Theodore, 1839-1900). Atlas of Dakota. Chicago / R. R. Donnelley 1884. Famous pathfinder John C. Fremont and scientist Joseph Nicollet explored this region of Dakota Territory approximately in May or June 1838. In their undated notes they described the area as the \\"lake country of the coteau prairie.\\" Some of their findings appear to be second hand accounts of the area. However, the expedition failed to include some of the lakes of the area on their map including, Kampeska. Lake Kampeska's settlement predates Watertown and statehood of South Dakota. Initially founded as Kampeska City, modern-day Codington County's borders were drawn in such a way that Lake Kampeska would be at the geographical epicenter of the county. Chicago and Northwestern Railroad operated near Lake Kampeska beginning in 1873. Codington, a Congregational clergyman, carved out the geographical location for the purpose of making the area a county-seat town. Kampeska City was the county-seat of Lake Kampeska County, until July 19, 1878, when a vote of the people removed the county-seat to Watertown after the railroad reactivated a line through that area. At the time of the vote, Watertown was not in fact a town. Towards the end of the 1870s, the northern shore of Lake Kampeska was designated by Arthur C. Mellette and territorial officials to serve as the location of the Capitol Building. However, when Benjamin Harrison signed South Dakota into statehood, the designation was changed to the geographic center of the state. The name Kampeska is not associated with founders of Watertown, the Kemp family.  Recreation  Kampeska Hotel circa 1913. Lake Kampeska is a popular site for recreational activities including fishing, sail boating, biking, swimming, waterskiing, camping, and picnicking. Public access to Lake Kampeska has locations on the north, east, south (State Recreation Area), and west shores of the lake. Lake Kampeska has one state park, Sandy Shores, one county owned park, Memorial Park, and two city owned parks, Jackson Park and Stokes-Thomas City Park. Lake Kampeska also has 15 miles of bike trails that parallel it. Two golf courses also border the lake; Prairie Winds Golf Course to the south and Cattail Crossing Golf Course to the south-east. Lake Kampeska is primarily managed as a Walleye and Smallmouth Bass fishery. Lake Kampeska contains black bullhead, black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, carp, channel catfish, smallmouth bass, white bass, northern pike, sunfish, rock bass, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Boating  Sailboat on the southern edge of Kampeska circa 1900. Boats of all sizes and horsepowers may be legally launched on Lake Kampeska. There is a no-wake zone in Hidden Valley on the east side of the lake. Although there are some sailboat enthusiasts who recreate on the lake, motorboats are in the clear majority in regard to quantity. The lake is also home to the Kampeska Yacht Club, which hosts the annual sail boating competition, the Kampeska Cup Regatta.  Environmental issues  Lake Kampeska briefly experienced problems with pollution from fertilizer and surface runoff until the 1990s. Although pollution remains an ongoing issue, conditions have improved and water quality is now closely monitored. A weir installed on the inlet-outlet channel of Lake Kampeska is intended to slow the input of sediments to the lake basin. When the Big Sioux River is high, water enters Lake Kampeska. Conversely, when the water level in Lake Kampeska is higher than the Big Sioux River and above the weir, water exits Lake Kampeska through the v-notch. The lake has experienced catastrophic flooding from rapid snow melts in recent years. In 1997, flooding of Lake Kampeska drew attention of the White House, sending then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore to visit the flooding.  In popular culture & art  Terry Redlin painted numerous artworks featuring landmarks of the area, such as Lake Kampeska Lodge, Sandy Shores, Memorial Park, and homes along the lake. Many of the paintings of the lake have received national interest, featured in Ducks Unlimited and on the cover of Farmer Magazine. Redlin fished on the lake since childhood and owned a home on Lake Kampeska until 2007. Among others, Neal Tapio, Nancy Turbak Berry, Fred H. Hildebrandt, Doron Jensen, and Arthur C. Mellette have previously maintained residences on the lake. Artists such as John Wilson, John Greene, and Joshua Spies have also used Lake Kampeska as inspiration for their respective artwork. According to popular legend, the Lake Kampeska Monster, possibly a lake sturgeon existed in excess of . However, there have been no sightings since the 1880s.

It is the origin of the reputed Quinta da Bica wines, which were among the founding wines of the Dão wine region, as well as being among the first wines in Portugal to be estate bottled. The estate's manor, commonly known as Casa da Bica, is currently the seat of the Viscounts of Sardoal, a cadet branch of the Spanish-Portuguese Sacadura Botte noble family. Originally a monastery, it was bought in the early 17th century by the Ferraz de Figueiredo family. With the marriage of its 7th lady, D. Margarida Amélia Gonçalves Santiago de Montalvão de Moraes Sarmento Figueiredo e Castro, to João de Azevedo Pacheco Pereira de Sande de Sacadura Botte Côrte-Real, in 1850, and its subsequent inheritance by their second son, it became the seat of a cadet branch of the Sacadura Botte family. Also due to this marriage, the estate benefited from the renowned viticulturist João de Sacadura Botte Côrte-Real's efforts to improve and perfect the quality of the region's wine. Nowadays, it is the only one of Sacadura Botte's former wine estates still owned by the family. History The estate's main house was originally built as a monastery, in the early 16th century. About a century later, it was bought by Filipe Ferraz de Figueiredo, a local landed noble knight, who also owned a manor in the nearby village of Seia. His son, João Ferraz de Figueiredo, bought some of the surrounding land, and his grandson, Manuel Ferraz de Figueiredo, instituted a majorat, including the main house, its dependencies and the surrounding lands, effectively creating the estate. Upon Manuel Ferraz de Figueiredo's death, the estate was inherited by Jacinto Ferraz de Figueiredo, his only male heir. However, Jacinto was a priest, and did not leave any children, so the estate was inherited by his sister, D. Maria Teresa de Matos Ferraz, married to Domingos Gonçalves Santiago, a King's Justice and Knight of the Order of Christ. Thus, the estate entered the Gonçalves Santiago family. This family was of Spanish descent, but had been established in the north-eastern region of Chaves for a few generations, their seat being Quinta da Raposeira, near the village of Outeiro Seco. The coat of arms of the Quinta da Bica is a result of this union: the shield featuring the impaled arms of the Gonçalves and Ferraz families, to which Domingos Gonçalves Santiago and D. Maria Teresa de Matos Ferraz respectively belonged. The marriage produced three surviving children: two sons and a daughter. The eldest, Vicente José Gonçalves Santiago de Figueiredo, followed his father's footsteps and became both a King's Justice and a Knight of the Order of Christ, as well as Lord of Quinta da Bica estate upon the death of his father. It was during his time that, in the midst of the Peninsular War, the main house suffered extensive damage after being set on fire by the French troops, under Marshall Masséna, retreating from their defeat at the Battle of Bussaco, in 1810. More than half of the main house was rendered unusable, and as a result it was subjected to extensive reconstruction work that lasted until the beginning of the 20th century. Vicente José Gonçalves Santiago de Figueiredo married D. Maria Caetana Madalena Ferreira de Montalvão de Moraes Sarmento e Castro, but their large issue consisted exclusively of daughters. The eldest, D. Ana Amélia Miquelina Gonçalves Santiago de Figueiredo de Moraes Sarmento e Castro, went on to inherit the estate, but never married, so her sister D. Rita Cândida Gonçalves Santiago de Montalvão became her heir presumptive. In an attempt to keep the estate in the family, D. Rita Cândida married her first cousin, José Gonçalves Santiago de Figueiredo, the only son of her father's younger brother, Joaquim José Gonçalves Santiago de Figueiredo, and his wife D. Francisca Teresa Joaquina Correia da Cunha. This attempt, however, only managed to postpone the changing of families for another generation, as D. Rita Cândida and her husband only had two daughters. The eldest of these was D. Margarida Amélia Gonçalves Santiago de Montalvão de Moraes Sarmento Figueiredo e Castro, who married João de Azevedo Pacheco Pereira de Sande de Sacadura Botte Côrte-Real, Lord of Quinta da Aguieira. João de Sacadura Botte Côrte-Real, as he was most often referred to, was a widely acclaimed viticulturist and winemaker. Contemporary reports called him \\"the greatest winemaker of these times\\", \\"the most enlightened viticulturist of his generation\\" and the \\"archetypal patriarch of the rural landed nobility\\". In his estate of Aguieira he produced some of the finest wines of the Dão Region, which he was partially responsible for creating, as he was the founder of the first União Vinícola do Dão. He had other estates, both in Portugal and Spain, and produced wine from some of them. The Quinta da Bica estate greatly benefited from this marriage, since it was under João de Sacadura Botte Côrte- Real's auspices that its vineyards were brought to prime condition and its now well-known wine was first commercialized. Upon his death, his eldest son inherited the main estate and family seat of Quinta da Agueira, whereas Quinta da Bica was inherited by his second son. He was João Pacheco de Sacadura Botte, a King's Justice, whose judicial career was, however, cut short by a crippling throat cancer. He survived, being treated in Germany with state-of- the-art medical care; and managed to communicate thanks to a specially designed silver device which acted as a prosthetic throat, but was unable to continue to serve as a King's Justice in result of the illness' effects. He continued, however, his father's work in both running the estate and wine- making, aided at different times by his three male sons, João, José Maria and Theodorico César. After King Dom Carlos I of Portugal and his heir apparent, Prince Royal Dom Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, were murdered in Lisbon, the estate had its main gates closed and standards lowered in mourning. João Pacheco de Sacadura Botte, at the time lord of the estate, personally knew the deceased king, and had hunted with him on occasion. After the proclamation of the Republic in Portugal, the estate continued flying the flag of the Kingdom of Portugal, as opposed to the new Portuguese Republic's flag, for decades. It also served as headquarters for Sacadura Botte's several unsuccessful campaigns to galvanize the Beira region into supporting attempts to restore the Monarchy. Genealogy Originally bought by Filipe Ferraz de Figueiredo, the Quinta da Bica was only instituted as a majorat (or in Portuguese), by his grandson Manuel Ferraz de Figueiredo. Thus, the third de facto owner of the estate was, de jure, its first lord. The estate's rules of succession gave preference to male heirs, as was usual, but, in their absence, did not exclude female heirs. The estate hence passed from the Ferraz de Figueiredo lineage to the Gonçalves Santiago lineage, and later on to the Sacadura Botte lineage, in which it remains to this day.

Driggs and Samuel Seabury, both US Navy officers, in partnership with William's brother Louis Labadie \\"L. L.\\" Driggs, originally to produce guns for the US Army and US Navy designed by the partners. After a few reorganizations and an entry into the motor vehicle market, the company reorganized again in 1925; its ultimate fate is unclear from references.Patent assigned by William Hale Driggs in 1906 to Driggs-Seabury Ordnance Corp.  History  Driggs-Seabury was preceded by the Driggs-Schroeder series of weapons, designed by W. H. Driggs and Seaton Schroeder in the late 1880s and produced by the American Ordnance Company in the 1890s. Driggs-Seabury incorporated the former Seabury Gun Company at its founding. Driggs-Seabury's plant was initially in Derby, Connecticut, in the former Brady Manufacturing facility.Williford, p. 222 Although Seabury died in 1902, followed by Driggs in 1908, the company continued under the leadership of Driggs' brother Louis Labadie \\"L. L.\\" Driggs until at least 1935. L. L. Driggs was formerly with the American Ordnance Company, manufacturer of Driggs-Schroeder weapons. The company moved production to Sharon, Pennsylvania in 1904; the US Rapid Fire Gun and Power Co. acquired the plant in Derby. The company manufactured motor vehicles 1913–15 and 1921–25, but sold its weapons production and plant in Sharon to Savage Arms in a 1915 merger.Poor’s Manual of Industrials, 1916, Vol. 7, New York: Redmond & Co., pp. 1722-1726Unofficial Savage Arms company historyOfficial Savage Arms history outline Under Savage Arms, the Sharon plant made Lewis guns in World War I. A probably related \\"Driggs Ordnance Company\\" existed in 1917. Dropping the Seabury name, Driggs was reconstituted as a motor vehicle manufacturer in New Haven, Connecticut in 1921, confusingly named \\"Driggs Ordnance & Manufacturing Corporation\\". Driggs went into receivership in 1925 due to delivery of inferior taxicabs. Driggs was reorganized out of receivership as \\"Driggs Ordnance and Engineering\\" in 1925. Over the next ten years, with assistance from the War and Navy departments, Driggs attempted to gain foreign orders and resume manufacturing in the United States. These efforts mostly involved anti-aircraft guns, both land and shipboard types, already in service with the United States and made partially with Driggs-designed components. The countries Driggs solicited included Poland, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, Lithuania, Venezuela, Colombia, and Guatemala. The military departments were attempting to increase the munitions manufacturing capacity of the United States, and required Driggs to secure orders of sufficient size to accomplish this before releasing plans of the non-Driggs components of these weapons to Driggs. The attempts to gain foreign orders appear to have been unsuccessful; in January 1932 L.L. Driggs wrote to the US Army's Chief of Ordnance that other governments were making even greater efforts on behalf of their companies. The ultimate fate of the Driggs company after 1935 is unclear.

Conceived by the Penang state government as part of the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP), the proposed line within the city of George Town will link the city centre with the industrial town of Bayan Lepas to the south. The Bayan Lepas LRT line is one of priority projects to be delivered under PTMP. Nineteen stations are to be built along the stretch. Eight additional stations will also be built on three islets that will be reclaimed off the southern coastline of Penang Island, bringing the overall length of the planned route to . The construction of the LRT line was approved by the federal government on 8 April 2019. Construction is expected to start in June 2020.  Overview  The Bayan Lepas LRT line forms the backbone of the Penang Transportation Master Plan, a comprehensive proposal formulated by the Penang state government to improve transportation within the State of Penang. Among the components of the plan, the LRT line is being prioritised by the state authorities for implementation, as the line will serve a densely populated urban and industrial corridor along the eastern coast of Penang Island, specifically between George Town proper and Bayan Lepas to the south. In addition, the LRT service would facilitate easier commute for tourists arriving via the Penang International Airport in Bayan Lepas.  History  SRS Consortium, a joint venture consisting of Gamuda Berhad, Ideal Property Development Sdn Bhd and Loh Phoy Yen Holdings, was appointed as the Project Delivery Partner (PDP) in 2015. Within the same year, the first public consultation session on the alignment of the proposed route was held. Following the sessions, the route was finalised and 27 stations identified; the eight southernmost stations will be built on three islets which will be reclaimed to the south of Penang Island. Much of the line will be elevated to reduce land acquisition and to preclude the relocation of underground utilities. As public transportation falls under the purview of the Malaysian federal government, the proposal was submitted to the Federal Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) by April 2016 for approval by the federal authorities. However, a political feud between the Pakatan Harapan-led Penang state government and the federal government at the time, which was dominated by Barisan Nasional, led to delays in securing the required federal approval. On 20 June 2020, chairman of the State Works Committee Zairil Khir Johari said that the LRT would continue, with or without the Federal government as it was funded through the land reclamation.

It has a large pre-historic mound which is known for its continuous archaeological record from the Neolithic age (about 2500–1345 BC) to the reign of the Pal dynasty who ruled during the pre-medieval period. The excavations in Chirand have revealed stratified Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Iron Age settlements, and transitions in human habitation patterns dating from 2500 BC to 30 AD. Location Chirand village is located on the northern bank of the Ganga River. The river Ghaghara joins Ganga a short distance away from the village, near Revelganj. The Sone River also joins Ganga about a few kilometres away from Chirand. About to the north of the mound there is a dry river bed which is inferred as one of the meandering dry loops of the Gandaki River. Thus, there are four rivers in the vicinity of Chirand. The village has undergone erosion due to which the mound abutting the Ganga River bank is exposed, revealing brick features and potsherds. On the top of the mound there is a mosque, which was built by Sultan Abul Muzaffar Hussain Shah of Bengal in 1503 AD. This mosque reveals ruins of pilasters of Hindu temples. Chirand is located from Chhapra, the district headquarters in the state of Bihar. The Archaeological Survey of India controls about of the area of the village. Climate The average annual rainfall in the area is . Much of the rainfall occurs from June to September when the snow melts and monsoons tend to start. The Ganga River tends to flow beyond capacity causing flooding and deposition of alluvium in the adjoining area. River erosion Part of the village, including about of the mound, have been subject to submergence and river erosion caused by the Ganga river. The Nonia tola in the village was in imminent danger of getting submerged. In 2010, protection of the part of the village exposed to erosion was envisaged by way of stone pitching. Demography The Chirand village, as per 2011 census, has a population of 2971 comprising 520 families. The male population is 1600 while that of females is 1371. Literacy rate is 61.09 % of the village compared to 61.80 % of the state. History The Pal dynasty ruled the region that included Chirand during the medieval period. Ananda, a disciple of Buddha, died in Chirand. King Mayurdhwaj of the Chero dynasty ruled from Chirand. W.W. Hunter, a historian known for publishing nine volumes of The Imperial Gazetteer of India, has recorded an account of this village which he visited in 1871. The Bihar State Directorate of Archaeology conducted excavations at the Chirand mound 1962–63 and returned for more 1970–71. The mound is in length. The Neolithic deposits uncovered a layer of thickness. The civilization includes area in India and South Asia that dates back to the Neolithic age according to archaeological finds from this village mound and four other locations in India. Chirand Neolithic group occupied the plains, while their contemporaries inhabited the plateaus and hills. The occupational categorization in Chirand covers three periods – Period I Neolithic (2500–1345 BC), Period II Chalcolithic (1600 B.C) and Period III Iron Age. Carbon dating of the top layer of the Neolithiic period dates the layer between 1910 BC and 1600 BC. The lowest level of the finds date to 200 BC. Economy Neolithic people experienced an economy that included hunting, gathering, fishing and animal rearing. Paddy husk impressions in some potsherds indicate Neolithic involvement in cultivating rice and cereals such as wheat, moong, masoor, and barley. Both cultivated and wild rice was harvested during summer and again during winter. The wild forms of rice are Oryza rifipogon and Oryza perennis, from which Oryza sativa (Asian rice) originated. Archaeological finds The archaeological finds in Chirand are from a Neolithic deposit of thickness, a Chalcolithic layer thick and iron age formation of thickness. Copper was used during the Chalcolithic period, while iron was found in the upper strata. A cache of 88 Kushan period coins were unearthed at the site. Animals Analysis of antiquities related to skeletal remains revealed 12 species of domesticated and wild animals: cattle, buffaloes (Bubalisbubalis linn), sheep (Ovis aries), cheetal (Axis axis), barasinga, pig, elephant, rhinoceros, cheetal (Axis axia), dog, a carp and two types of turtles. Bones of birds and fish were also found. Faunal finds indicate that the area was forested over an undulating topography. Pottery 25,000 potsherds excavated from Chirand are grouped according to the Period II Neolithic pottery appearing more refined than the Period I pottery, all from smoothed clay mixed with mica. Most of the pottery was hand made. Some vessels were made by turn table or dabbing. Half of the potsherds are red ware and half are black and red ware from different shapes and sizes of vases, bowls, and knobbed pottery. Pot wares in varying designs in post-firing painting technique in ochre colour, generally of grey ware and few in red-ware were also found. The Chalcolithic pottery unearthed at the site are of black and red ware pots and pans. Housing Neolithic people lived in circular wattle and daub huts made of mud and reeds with rammed floors. Earlier hut floors were built below ground level, later hut floors were built at ground level. Hearths and oblong shaped ovens were found in a semicircular hut. The white colour of the soil around the hearth and the ovens found at the site pointed to animal meat roasted in the ovens, likely for community feeding. Rice was a staple food. Mud boundary walls of houses were traced. Burnt chunks of clay with reed or bamboo impressions suggest that houses were destroyed by fire. Houses were larger in size in the Chalcolithic period compared to the Neolithic period, made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and flooring of fired earth. A circular hearth and a few post-holes were also found. Stone implements The Neolithic stone implements of celts were found. Axes found were made of quartzite, basalt and granite. The finds included nine types of microliths. Waste flakes found in the area indicate prevalence of the process of manufacture in a well established microlithic industry in the area that included chert, chalcedony, agate and jasper, derived from the dry river bed of the Son river. The final products in the collection are stone discs in long, cylindrical and triangular shapes. Crafts Pendants, ear-rings, bangles, discs and combs from the Neolithic period were found. 400 bone tools, mostly used for hunting, made from antler and long bones of deer and cattle were found in Chirand and at Burzahom from Period II and Period III. Terracotta figurines included humped bulls, birds, snakes, and human female figurines. The snake figures are indicative of existence of Naga cult among the Neolithic people. The human female figurines possibly relate to either a mother goddess, a goddess of fertility, or both. Ornaments made from tortoise and ivory were also found. A painted motif of the sacred peepal leaf (Ficus religiosa) was found. A foot stand of large sarcophagus indicates mortuary rites of the Neolithic people. Celebrations Fair An annual fair is held in Chirand during the last day of the month of Kartik (October–November) at a location known as Chyavana-asrama. Festival The state government proposed an annual festival titled 'Chirand Mahotsava' with the support of Chirand Vikas Parishad. Theme park A theme park depicting the different civilizations of Chirand is currently being planned.

Descended of an old family from Umbria, at the beginning of his university studies, he was called to military service and he spent four years in the Italian army during World War II. Silori served in the ill-fated Acqui Division and was a survivor of the Cephalonia Massacre. After 1945, he graduated in Literature and started to write novels and theatrical texts. In 1954 he started to collaborate with Italian Radio Television and he became very popular in Italy as the man that introduced the books on TV. Biography Early life and education Luigi Silori was born in Rome in 1921, only son. His father, Fernando, was a landowner in Stifone, descendant of an old family of Narni. His mother, Antonietta Pacchelli, was a school teacher, who graduated in Rome in 1901, when such a thing still was for a woman very uncommon in Italy. She was also a piano teacher and writer. He lived in an old house in Rome's middle-class Quartiere Trieste. After primary school, Silori attended a distinguished grammar school, the classical gymnasium Torquato Tasso, where he had brilliant classmates, like the actor Vittorio Gassman, that was his friend for decades, and the theater director Luigi Squarzina. World War II At the beginning of 1941, when he was still 19 ys. old, Silori was called to military service and ordered as a gunnery lieutenant of Italian Army to Greece with 33rd Mountain Infantry Division Acqui, that occupied the island of Cephalonia during the Greco- Italian War. Following the Italian surrender on 8 September 1943, thousands of soldiers from the division were murdered on the islands during Operation Achse, in what became known as the Cephallonia massacre, one of the largest prisoner of war massacres of the war and one of the largest-scale German atrocities to be committed by Wehrmacht troops. Silori was one of the few officers that, at the end, weren't gunned down by Wehrmacht and he was deported to Germany and sent to the concentration camp of Meppen - Fullen. Post-World War II Era Years of Television Last years and death He died in Rome on 9 July 1983, aged 61. He left his wife Daisy, after 38 years of marriage and his only son Fernando, aged 27.

It exists as a four volume publication and online database in the form of a website APiCS Online. The atlas was edited by Susanne Maria Michaelis, Philippe Maurer, Martin Haspelmath, and Magnus Huber. The project ran between 2006 and 2013. The project involved 78 linguists contributing with data on languages that they are experts on. This makes APiCS different from other similar surveys of languages where there is typically one or a team of researchers gathering data on many languages by reading different descriptions. The project also has a wiki page APiCS wikipage. It is part of the Cross-Linguistic Linked Data project hosted by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. APiCS gathers comparable synchronic data on the grammatical and lexical structures of a large number of pidgin and creole languages. The data is presented in the form of maps and profile pages for each language. The profile pages for the languages also includes sociohistorical information about each language. The published physical volumes contains more information of this kind than the online version. Languages included The project covers 76 contact languages (pidgins, creoles and mixed languages). The language set contains not only the most widely studied Atlantic and Indian Ocean creoles, but also less well known pidgins and creoles from Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Melanesia and Australia, including some extinct varieties. The Atlas does not make any classification into what is and what is not a pidgin/creole/mixed language. It is up to the readers and users of the database to make these classifications. This is a very important point, as it is inappropriate to refer to all languages in the APiCS as creoles. Each language is the responsibility of a single author or a team of authors, which were requested to fill out a questionnaire for the 130 structural features and to write a sociohistorical and grammatical survey article for their language. There are also 18525 audio examples online to illustrate the features for each language. Structural features The database consists of 130 structural features which are drawn from all areas of grammar: phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon. A feature has between two and nine values, shown on the maps by different colours and shapes of the language symbols. The online version of the database includes interactive map display and various filtering and search functions, allowing users to address various research questions. Furthermore, the online version also includes sound files of every language, enabling the users to listen to a short text that is glossed and translated. One of the important differences between APiCS and World Atlas of Language Structures, as well as other earlier surveys of languages, is that APiCS allows for languages to be coded for more than one strategy. For example, in the WALS there is one feature for the order of Subject, Object and Verb. Each language in WALS is coded as having one of the orders, or \\"no dominant order\\". In APiCS there is a mirror feature, but here each language can be coded for having more than one order and the distribution is given in percentages. The language Media Lengua for example is coded as having 30% SVO and 70% SOV. Contributors cannot select any percentage, they choose between the following: * exclusively (100%) * pervasive (90%) * majority (70%) * about half (50%) * minority (30%) * marginal (10%) When a summary is given for a feature users are displayed both with information on how many languages are coded as that value exclusively or as shared. There are for example 61% languages in APiCS that are coded as exclusively having the order SVO, and 10 that are coded as having that order and other orders as well (shared). APiCS and the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) APiCS was inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), which shows the geographical distribution of 142 features in an average of 400 languages worldwide. Pidgins and creoles were not completely excluded from WALS, but since the primary goal was to present the precolonial linguistic areas, pidgins and creoles were backgrounded. APiCS contains 48 features on which information is also available in WALS APiCS- WALS, so that creoles and pidgins can readily be compared with their substrate and superstrate languages, as well as with the world's languages in general. However, APiCS does not copy WALS blindly, but adds many features that did not make it into WALS but are important for contact languages. Other features that appear in WALS have been modified to suit the needs of the APiCS users. As stated above, one of the major differences between WALS and APiCS is that APiCS allows for multiple values for one feature whereas WALS does not.

It is a parasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), an economically important pest of citrus crops around the world and a vector for Citrus greening disease. Description The adults of Tamarixia radiata are small, 0.92 to 1.04 mm long, black wasps which have widely separated eyes, which are red in newly emerged adults, on a head which is slightly wider than its length. It has transparent wings which have pale yellow veins. There is marked sexual dimorphism with the male antennae being one and a half times the length of female antennae, the antennae of the males contain long and slightly curved setae while female antennae have short setae. The males are also slightly smaller than females in length and have smaller wings, as well as normally being darker on the abdomen. On the females the ovipositor barely protrudes. In both males and females the head and thorax are shiny black and the posterior dorsal and lateral portions of the gastric segments are black and the vent and a patch on the anterior dorsal gaster are pale, sometime yellow. The legs are off white in colour. Distribution Tamarixia radiata was initially described as Tetrastichus radiatus in 1922 by the British entomologist James Waterston from specimens collected in 1921 from part of the Punjab which is now in Pakistan. The natural range of T. radiata extends from Yemen and Saudi Arabia in the west to China and Indonesia in the east. When it was reported that this species was a highly efficient parasitoid of Diaphorina citri on the French Mascarene island of Réunion, it was spread around the world to control its host. T. radiata and has been introduced or spread to Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guadeloupe, Mauritius, Mexico, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Puerto Rico and the United States. Biology Tamarixia radiata is an idiobiont ectoparasitoid of Diaphorina citri. The female wasp lays one or occasionally two eggs on the underside of a nymph of its host, between the third pair of legs. Even if two eggs are laid beneath a nymph only one adult wasp will result so T. radiata is a solitary parasitoid. One adult female T. radiata can lay up to 300 eggs in her life. On hatching the larvae attach themselves to the host and begin to feed on its haemolymph which eventually results in the death of the host. The newly hatched larvae are about 0.28mm long and 0.11mm wide, they go through four instars and reach .14 mm long and 0.59 mm wide in their fourth instar. In the later stages of its growth the larval T. radiata will have totally excavated the body cavity of the host nymph. The nymph's body turns a dark brown colour and becomes \\"mummified\\". The T radiata pupa extrudes silk which is used to adhere the excavated host's body to the twig where the nymph was feeding and sometimes the silk can be seen around a nymph with a T. radiata pupa within The larvae then pupates within the remains of the host and the adult wasp emerges through a hole, visible to the naked eye, in the nymph's thorax or head. The wasps will parasitise any age of host nymph but prefer the fifth instar nymphs. Under laboratory conditions, the development time from oviposition to the emergence of the adult from the host can take 11.4 days. Tamarixia radiata emergence hole in mummified host nymph Adult female T. radiata live on average for 23.6 days while the shorter-lived males have an average longevity of 11.4 days. The males are polygynous but the females normally mate once and mating does not affect longevity. The females mate on emergence, or at least within a day, and most mate only once. There are normally 1.8 females for every 3.2 males, but the sex ratio varies depending on the origin of the colony and conditions the wasps are reared under. As well as parasitizing the nymphs of its host adult female T. radiata are known to obtain protein for egg laying by feeding on the haemolymph of D. citri nymphs which they obtain by puncturing the nymph's skin with their ovipositor. It is thought that one female T. radiata may kill up to 500 nymphs of D. citri in her lifetime by a combination of parasitism and predation. Both the male and the female wasps have also been recorded feeding on the honeydew excreted by D. citri. Although adults of T. radiata are attracted to fluorescent lights it is thought that the females detect host through olfactory cues. Experiments having shown that female wasps are attracted to the volatile chemicals emitted by the nymphs of D. citri while males are attracted to the volatiles emitted by female T. radiata. It has also been found that female T. radiata avoid laying eggs in nymphs which have already been parasitized, unless there is a shortage of nymphs in which case superparasitism may occur. Use as a Biological Control Tamarixia radiata is an obligate ectoparasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diophorina citri) which is a pest of citrus crops, the type specimen was collected from D. citri attacking lemon leaves. D. citri is one of the main vectors for the transmission of the bacterial infection citrus greening disease to citrus trees, a disease which can devastate citrus orchards and which had been known in China since the 19th Century. In the early part of the 20th century it began to be recorded in new areas in Asia and Africa and in the 1950s psyllids were shown to be vectors of the disease. In the early 2000s the disease was found in Brazil and Florida. In the early 1960s both T. radiata and the encytrtid Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis, another parasitoid of D. cirti were introduced to Réunion where they successfully controlled populations of their host and reduced the impact of the disease. In a survey conducted on Réunion showed that T. radiata had parasitized up to about 70% of the potential host nymphs, while D. aligarhensis had parasitized less than 20%. Once the disease appeared in Florida colonies of T. radiata were imported from Taiwan and Vietnam and released between 1999 and 2001 and it appears to have been at least partially successful at establishing itself. It has also been recorded in Puerto Rico and Texas where no known deliberate releases have taken place. Its effectiveness in suppressing its host populations in Florida has been variable probably due to the differences in climate from their places of origin and predation by coccenellild beetles which preyed on the psyllids consuming many that were playing host to T. radiata. In California colonies of T. radiata were bred from specimens captured in the Punjab as the climate there was thought to be closest to that of southern California. The wasps have been recovered some months after the initial release suggesting that they have bred in the wild and are capable of forming self sustaining populations. The wasps have also been found up to 65 miles from the release sites showing that they will disperse. The project is run by University of California Riverside and the insects bred by them show wider genetic variability than T. radiata elsewhere, reflecting the careful sourcing and selection of the founder specimens. The release of Tamarixia radiata for biological control of D. citri in California has potentially been affected by ants, especially the Argentine ant. Ants guard the nymphs of various bugs in return for a reward of honeydew. Ants have been observed to capture and consume Tamarixia wasps they encounter among clumps of D. citri nymphs as well as chasing the wasps away from the nymphs if they were unable to catch them. When D. citri populations are tended by ants then control of the ants may be necessary if the parasitoids are to control the psyllids. In addition, it is possible that the use of insecticides could affect the populations and rates of parasitism of D. citri by T. radiata so an effective integrated pest management program would involve the use of selective insecticides or pesticides harmful to the adult wasps, as long as the adult are not part of a self sustaining population or that the application of the pesticide does not coincide with releases of adult wasps.

The odorant receptor Or83b is not exclusively expressed in insects. Though its actual function is still a mystery, the broadly expressed Or83b has been conserved across highly divergent insect populations across 250 million years of evolution.  Function  There are two contending models for potentially explaining Or83b function. One proposes are that it could interact with specific odor stimuli independently of other odorant receptors (ORs). The other proposes that it could act with other ORs to mediate responses to all odors. Or83b mutation disrupts behavioral and electrophysiological responses to many odorants, which supports the second model that OR plays a general rather than specific role in olfaction. When mutating the Or83b gene, larval Drosophila do not travel towards an area of ethyl acetate which is an important odorant related to rotting fruit.. Functional conservation The OR genes appear to be a single lineage nested within the gustatory receptor (GR) family. Or83b, however, is divergent from other OR proteins and appears most similar to the usual GRs. This conservation suggests that Or83b serves a function unlike that of other chemoreceptors. By cloning orthologs of Or83b, performing in situ hybridization of the clones, and by creating transgenic flies with orthologs of mosquitos, medflies, and moths, the function of Or83b was determined to be conserved across highly divergent insect populations. Or83b has homologs in other insect species. Since Or83b responds not to specific odors but to odors in general the Or83b receptor must respond to a feature of other ORs that it has coevolved with. That insects have used only a single protein for odor detection suggests that Or83b functions in insects in a way that cannot be diversified. Practical implications Since insects play a large role in spreading infectious blood borne diseases between humans, understanding how they locate their human hosts with their olfactory systems could lead to inhibiting their method of locating hosts. The potential strategy involved would be to create small molecules that mimic the Or83b mutation and inhibit the receptor and disperse them, since it would be impractical to mutate the gene for the receptor in an entire population of disease-spreading insects. In some species of insect, drawing blood meals is a behavior not normally witnessed that could be brought on by a sudden lack of avoidance of vertebrate odor. Food preference in insects is not always about attraction to certain odors but the lack of repellant response to the odor. The fruit-piercing moth (Calyptrata thalictri) has been known to draw blood from mammalian hosts when the number of a particular group of olfactory sensing neurons that generally produce a repellent response to vertebrate volatiles is reduced. This halts their usually innate repulsive behavior to vertebrate odors and increases the chance that they will attempt to draw blood from a host. Because this is a change not in Or83b but in a population of olfactory sensory neurons, dispersing molecules to inhibit Or83b would not stop the behavior and a new strategy would have to develop.

Bird previously played for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks where he won the 2016 NRL Grand Final. He is a New South Wales State of Origin, Country Origin, Prime Minister's XIII and Indigenous All Stars representative. Background Bird was born in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia, and is of Indigenous Australian descent. Bird played his junior rugby league for the Berkeley Eagles, before being signed by the St George Illawarra Dragons. Bird attributed his early success to his idol, the Balmain Brawler, Jody Pennell, who was a Tigers great back in the 80's. Pennell was quoted as describing a young Bird as someone he could see great potential in, on and off the field. Playing career Early career In 2013 and 2014, Bird played for the St George Illawarra Dragons' NYC team. On 3 May 2014, Bird played for the New South Wales under-20s team against the Queensland under-20s team, playing at lock in the 30-8 win at Penrith Stadium. On 18 September 2014, Bird signed a two-year contract with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks starting in 2015. On 18 October 2014, Bird played for the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis, playing at centre in the 15-14 loss at Mt Smart Stadium. 2015 On 31 January and 1 February 2015, Bird played for Cronulla-Sutherland in the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines. In round 4 of the 2015 NRL season, Bird made his NRL debut for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks against the Gold Coast Titans, playing off the interchange bench in Cronulla's 24-22 loss at Shark Park. In his next match in round 5 against the Sydney Roosters, Bird played at five-eighth for Cronulla-Sutherland in the absence of regular five-eighth Ben Barba. Bird scored two tries and set up another in the Sharks' 20–12 upset win over the 2013 premiers, causing him to be selected again at five-eighth the next week ahead of Barba who was named on the interchange bench. On 3 May 2015, Bird played for New South Wales Country against New South Wales City in the 2015 City vs Country Origin match, playing at halfback in Country's 34–22 win at Wagga Wagga. On 28 September 2015, at the 2015 Dally M Awards night, Bird was named the Dally M Rookie of the Year after playing in 23 matches and scoring 8 tries for Cronulla. 2016 On 15 January 2016, Bird re-signed with Cronulla-Sutherland on a one-year contract. In February 2016, Bird played for the Sharks in the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines. On 8 May 2016, Bird played for Country Origin against City Origin, where he played at halfback in the 44–30 loss in Tamworth. On 22 June 2016, Bird made his representative debut for New South Wales in Game 2 of the 2016 State of Origin series, where played he filled the void on the interchange bench for Dylan Walker who shifted to centre in the 26–16 loss at Suncorp Stadium. Bird also played in Game 3, where he again played off interchange bench in the Blues 18–14 win at ANZ Stadium. On 2 October 2016, in Cronulla's 2016 NRL Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm, Bird played at centre and bravely played the majority of the match with an elbow injury in the historic 14–12 victory. Bird finished his successful 2016 NRL season with him playing in 26 matches and scoring 6 tries for Cronulla-Sutherland. 2017 In February 2017, Bird was selected in the Sharks 2017 NRL Auckland Nines squad. On 10 February 2017, Bird played for the Indigenous All Stars against the World All Stars in the 2017 All Stars match, starting at centre and scoring a try in the 34–8 win at Hunter Stadium. On 13 April 2017, it was announced that Bird signed a lucrative four-year deal, worth $4 million with the Brisbane Broncos starting in 2018. For the 2017 State of Origin series, Bird played in all 3 matches off the interchange bench for the Blues in their 2–1 series loss. Bird finished his last year with Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks with him playing in 17 matches and scoring 3 tries in the 2017 NRL season. On 23 September 2017, Bird played for Prime Minister's XIII against Papua New Guinea, starting at five-eighth in the 48–8 win in Port Moresby. 2018 When Bird arrived in Brisbane, he had an existing shoulder injury that he suffered at the end of the 2017 season and Broncos coach Wayne Bennett claimed that the Sharks didn’t disclose the full extent of his injury before his move, the Broncos were only aware of his injury by Bird himself and that he needed surgery that would’ve ruled him out for till at least Round 4. In round 3 of the 2018 NRL season, Bird made his club debut for Brisbane earlier than expected against the Wests Tigers, playing at centre in the gritty 9-7 win at Campbelltown Stadium. After the match, Bird was heavily criticised by NRL fans for looking overweight, Bird commenting, \\"I don't really care what they think to be honest\\", \\"I'm happy with my weight, I feel good, \\"I do have to lose some body fat but it comes with time, being injured doesn't help, \\"Give me time and hopefully I can slim down a little bit but I'm feeling healthy.\\" In round 10 against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Bird succumbed to the sternum injury that has plagued him for nine months and end his season early during Brisbane's 38-24 loss at Suncorp Stadium.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/broncos/wayne- bennett-concedes-jack-birds-nrl-season-likely-over/news- story/d3b3d9243103c3703c838b1e5b625813 Bird would have a horror 2018 NRL season, only playing in 8 matches for the Broncos because of his shoulder and sternum injuries were still ongoing during the year. 2019 Bird made his return for Brisbane in the 2019 season opening round 1 match against the Melbourne Storm, playing at centre in the 22-12 loss at AAMI Park.https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/storm-v-broncos-live-coverage- of-round-1-blockbuster/live-coverage/f83f3088c210927d1e6332f4bf166e29 Following the match, Bird was receiving negative feedback on social media about his performance despite it was his first match back since round 10 of the previous season, fans were quick to judge his performance based on an early error, and he finished with 127 running metres, three tackle-breaks and 11 tackles.

Chaillet created the Centennial Light, which has been illuminating a fire station in Livermore, California, for over a century. Chaillet was knowledgeable in chemistry and mineralogy. Early life Adolphe A. Chaillet was born in Paris on July 15, 1867. He was the son of Samuel Alexander Chaillet, a Swedish watchmaker, and Eugénie Eva Wendawowicz, a Russian.Twelfth Census of the United States, enumerated on June 18, 1900, Shelby Village, Precinct B, Sharon Township, Richland County, Ohio, Vol 130, E. D. 136, Sheet 14, Line 96. Chaillet was a graduate of both German and French scientific institutions. In addition to a thorough knowledge of electrical engineering, Chaillet was capable as a chemist and mineralogist. In a newspaper article, he commented on Darwin's theory of evolution. Chaillet started in the incandescent lamp business with his father, who operated a factory near Paris. Chaillet was engaged by the Schaefer Company in Germany to assist in making filament lamps. He remodeled their plant and was later put in charge of the largest factory in Germany. Emigration and marriage Chaillet emigrated to the United States in 1892 to manufacture lamps in Marlboro, Massachusetts (probably in what was then known as the Bryan-Marsh Company). Later, he was employed in the design department of the General Electric Company in Lynn, Massachusetts. About 1896, Chaillet completed a design for an electric locomotive for the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company of Columbus, Ohio. Chaillet married Maude L. Bickmore (b. 1877) of Massachusetts. The couple had two sons—Alexander B. Chaillet (b. November 1896) and Arnold Chaillet (b. August 1898)—and a daughter—Catherine Chaillet (b. January 1899). All three children were born in Shelby, Ohio. Shelby Electric Works In the latter part of July, 1896, John Cooper Whiteside, former superintendent at the Cooper Engine Works in Mount Vernon, Ohio, mentioned to John Chamberlain Fish, a businessman in Shelby, Ohio, that Chaillet had an idea for an improved incandescent lamp that was 20% more efficient and had 30% more life than other models. This aroused the interest of Fish. On August 7, 1896, a newspaper article announced that a contract had been negotiated between Chaillet, Whiteside, Fish and some other Shelby investors. Chaillet became technical manager and was named to the company board of directors.\\"The Shelby Electric Works – A Description of One...\\" The Shelby News (Shelby, Ohio), December 18, 1896. > \\"A. A. Chaillet, the technical manager of the company, and upon whom it > chiefly depends for its advice regarding all points pertaining to the > manufacturing of its product, was engaged in the factory operated by his > father near Paris, France, when the incandescent lamp was made by them in > Europe. The professor has been engaged as a manufacturer of incandescent > lamps since 1878, having had charge of the laboratory of the largest factory > in Germany. Mr. Chaillet came to this country in 1892 to manufacture lamps > at Marlboro, Mass. He had been engaged in Germany by the Schaefer company to > assist it in making filaments and remodeling its plant.

Professor Chaillet is not only an > electrician of extensive experience and knowledge, but is a thorough chemist > and mineralogist.\\" Chaillet was on the Board of Directors until their annual meeting on August 29, 1902, when he was not re-elected. Jas. Wormley & Co. had sole agency for the Shelby tipless lamp in Cook County, Illinois, and Minnesota from the first day of manufacture. In 1902, Wormley became a director of Shelby Electric. Chaillet was granted only two U. S. Patents from 1896 to 1922, for a lamp socket and a light bulb; both were applied for while he was associated with Shelby Electric. Improved incandescent light bulb Chaillet's light-bulb design involved flattening the elliptically-looped carbon filament coil set transversely to the longitudinal axis of the lamp, as well as flattening the end of the globe, or bulb at its tip end, parallel to the loops, so that the greatest intensity of light is thrown downward when the bulb is hung from the ceiling. The Chaillet lamp was tested with others in January, 1897. Manufacturing of the lamp started about February 1, 1897. The lamp was put on the market in March, 1897. The original Chaillet lamp appeared in Electrical World on February 6, 1897. The complete details of the lamp design were not revealed in that article. It was a tipless lamp with a carbon filament that was manufactured using a secret process. Quoting directly from the article: > The lamp possesses a number of peculiar features which it is claimed give to > it certain elements of superiority above all others. The filament is square > cut by means of automatic machinery from sheets of material produced by a > secret chemical process. The cut filament, after being formed, is attached > to platinum terminals which are sealed into the sides at the lower end of > the lamp bulb. The filament is of such high resistance that in the Shelby > lamps it is shorter than that of most other commercial lamps of equal > rating. The bulb is not exhausted from the top, which in connection with the > exceedingly small filament used makes the completed lamp one of the > smallest, also one of the neatest, lamps on the market. In reality, it would have been difficult to prove conclusively that a new lamp design would perform in a superior manner to a competitive lamp that had a different filament configuration. The reason for making such a statement here is that while power input into a lamp could be easily measured, the light output had to have been measured in a spherical photometer. In the 1880s and 1890s, light output measurements were usually measured with a horizontal photometer. A horizontal measurement determines light output in only one direction rather than a total integrated value. Thus, while the Chaillet design might have been a better one relative to the competitive lamps it is not easy to conclude that now. In an Electrical Review article of March 10, 1897, pg 111, the origin of Shelby light bulb filaments was discussed. Some manufacturers apparently thought that Shelby filaments were purchased in Europe. The Electrical Review telegraphed the Shelby Electric Company for the purpose of determining the truth about the origin of the filaments. The following are excerpts from Shelby's response: > The question of taking licenses to manufacture under the Westinghouse > patents is one which we have not definitely decided....We have secured > copies of the entire number of patents, which they claim to own or control, > and we know positively that we do not want to infringe on any of them. We > think that we are the only company manufacturing lamps in the United States > to-day who can make such a statement. With reference to the filament which > we use, we would say that we are using a square filament, not a cellulose > filament. Our filament is not imported from Germany. We are manufacturing it > here in Shelby, but it is the same filament which our Professor Chaillet > discovered in Germany, and one that is most successfully being used by two > of the most prominent lamp factories of Europe, by a special arrangement > with our Professor Chaillet. The filament is much nearer pure carbon than > anything on the market, it being so hard after being carbonized that it will > scratch glass very readily....We could ourselves secure patents on over a > hundred different devices, which we use in our manufacture, but prefer to > keep them secret....We are not selling lamps on prices, but on quality.... At first, Chaillet did not patent the new lamp design, nor its details, preferring to keep them as trade secrets. Chaillet filed a patent application on October 22, 1900, which was granted on July 2, 1902. Later life 1902, Chaillet left the Shelby company board of directors. He later moved to Mexico City with his family. Chaillet worked at the lamps branch in Mexico City during the period from 1904 to 1914. In 1914, the Mexican Revolution forced Chaillet to return to the United States. Chaillet died some time after 1914.

He was the last Superior of the Salesians that knew Don Bosco alive. He was also the founder of the Salesian Pontifical University.  Life  Ricaldone was born in 1870 in Mirabello in a family of farmers of middle class. His father became major of the town. He did his first years of education in Alassio and then moved to Borgo San Marino where he knew Don Bosco - he would meet the saint only two times in his life. In 1889 he joint the Salesian Novitiate of Valsalice and became religious in 1890. He was sent as a teacher to Utrera, Spain and continued his studies of theology in Sevilla. In 1893 became director of the Salesian College of Sevilla. In 1898 Don Rua sent him to visit the Salesian houses of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. In 1901 was elected Superior of the Spanish Province, but also he is appointed to visit the Salesian houses in the Western Hemisphere as well as Egypt and Palestine. He is elected general administrator of the Salesians in 1922. He promoted the Salesian press, making several educative publications.Wirth, Morand (1971). Don Bosco y los Salesianos. Barcelona: Ediciones Don Bosco. p. 274. In 1926 he led the Salesian Missionary Exposition in Turin and was sent to make visits to Salesian houses in India, Japan, Thailand, Myanmar and China.  Rector Major  The Salesian Chapter of 1932 elected Ricaldone as the 4th Successor of Don Bosco. He was the first Superior that did not have a personal contact with the Founder, although he saw Don Bosco alive twice. In 1936 the Salesians suffered a great persecution during the Spanish Civil War in a country that was very near to his heart. In 1939 began the World War II with devastating consequences for the Salesian works, disconnecting the General House in Turin with the rest of the world. There were also several difficulties in China and East Europe. In 1951 Ricaldone reported that there were 1,900 Salesians deported, banished from their own nations or deprived from their freedom.Wirth, Morand (1971). «XXII». Don Bosco y los Salesianos. Barcelona: Ediciones Don Bosco. p. 280. During his government, Pope Pius XI canonized Don Bosco and he could transferred the Salesian Theologate of La Crocetta in Turin to Rome as the Salesian Pontifical University.

More than two thirds of the total area of Telemark, or above 10,000 square kilometres, belong to the traditional region of Upper Telemark. Conversely, Lower Telemark refers to the more densely populated, flatter coastal area of Grenland and traditionally also includes Central Telemark. Upper Telemark has a varied and often scenic landscape, with many hills, mountains, valleys and lakes. Upper Telemark was originally known simply as Telemark and is named for the Thelir (Old Norse: Þilir), the ancient North Germanic tribe that inhabited what is now called Upper Telemark and Numedal in the Migration Period and the Viking Age. Upper Telemark is known for its folk traditions within music, clothing, handcrafts, food and architecture. The region is also distinctly marked by its dialect of Norwegian. The district is also conventionally divided into Vest- Telemark and Aust-Telemark, with Vest-Telemark consisting of Vinje, Tokke, Seljord, Fyresdal, Kviteseid, Nissedal, and Aust-Telemark consisting of Hjartdal, Notodden and Tinn. Whereas Lower Telemark was traditionally dominated by the burghers of the cities, Upper Telemark was for centuries dominated by a close-knit \\"aristocracy of officials\\" comprised by a handful of families which monopolized the state and church offices in the region, notably the families Paus, Blom, Ørn and Morland.Jon Nygaard (2013). «...af stort est du kommen». Henrik Ibsen og Skien (p. 68 and p. 74). Senter for Ibsen-studier. Etymology A 1636 map of southern Norway shows (Upper) Telemark as a mostly white field The Old Norse form of the name was Þelamörk or Þilamörk. The first element; Þilir was the name of the inhabitants, and is assumed to be connected with Þelli (pine). The last element mörk means forest or march. History Administrative history Bratsberg amt with Upper and Lower Telemark Traditionally, the term Telemark only referred to this area and Numedal. In 1200, the current Upper Telemark and Grenland were merged into Skiens syssel, which later became Bratsbergs amt, and is the current county of Telemark. Upper Telemark comprises a provostship in the state Church of Norway, Upper Telemark provostship (), which now comprises 12 municipalities and more than 80% of Telemark (more than 12,000 square kilometres), making it one of the largest provostships in Norway. The provostship has existed since the middle ages, but was partitioned in two in 1838, before being reunified in 2015. Upper Telemark has also been a judicial district (sorenskriveri). The border between Upper Telemark and Grenland has long been discussed among philologists. In an old travel book about the county, A.L. Coll has written that the border is defined by the mountainous cleft, that is formed by the lakes Bolkesjø, Ørvella, Øverbø-moen, Seljordvatnet, Flåvatn and Fjågesund or Bjårvatn.

She is also the founder and director of TransCultural Exchange, a non-profit organization that produces global art projects – most notably, an International Conference on Opportunities in the Arts.  Early life and education  Sherman was born in Pensacola, Florida in 1957. Three months after her birth, her family moved to Midway Island, where she was raised. After graduating with a B.A. from Boston College in 1980, she went on to receive her M.F.A. in 1998 from New York University. As a graduate student, Sherman did an internship with Ursula von Rydingsvard, who inspired Sherman's work.  Career  In the late 80s, Sherman created an exchange show of her and other Chicago and Viennese artists' work in Chicago at the Ludwig Drum Factory. That show was the first of a two-part exhibition entitled Reverse Angle in 1989–1990, with the second part taking place in Vienna at the WUK Kunsthalle, which subsequently led to her founding TransCultural Exchange. More recently, Sherman often works with composers on her artwork, which is known to be different from the traditional definition of painting as a flat, two-dimensional object. She combines paintings with electronics and sounds to create multi-sensory installations. Her works have been shown at numerous institutions, including Taipei's Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts Seoul's Kwanhoon Gallery Trondheim's Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Galleri KiT, Shanghai's Zendai MoMA and New York's Trans Hudson Gallery. In 2016, a survey of her work with art and sound was shown at Oboro in Montreal, following her collaborative show Delay with Florian Grond, also at Oboro as part of the International Digital Art Biennial (BIAN) and the Montreal Digital Spring 2016. Sherman also teaches at Boston College and Northeastern University and has served as the interim Associate Director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Program in Art, Culture and Technology. She was also an Artist in Residence at MIT from 2003 to 2004. She has published numerous articles on the visual arts in such publications as ARTnews, Arts International, and The Boston Globe and was the chief art critic for the Chicago Sun-Times and a columnist for WBUR's online magazine. Sherman has also curated numerous exhibitions. In 2000, she curatedThe Coaster Project at the 2000 London Biennale, which was later displayed at 100 sites in the next three months.

He founded the Secular Institute of Don Bosco Volunteers. Rinaldi was close friends since his childhood to Saint Giovanni Bosco and Paolo Albera and it was Bosco who guided Rinaldi who was torn in his adolescence between the farming life and the religious life. The order held him in high esteem from the outset and noted the potential within him as well as seeing the charism of Bosco encompassed in Rinaldi. Rinaldi's beatification was celebrated under Pope John Paul II in 1990. Life Filippo Rinaldi was born in mid-1856 in Lu Monferrato as the eighth child to the farmers Cristobolo Rinaldi and Antonia Brezza. He knew Saint Giovanni Bosco since 1861. Two brothers of his would later priests much like himself. Rinaldi started his educational studies at Mirabello Monferrato in which the Salesians of Don Bosco oversaw his education; the assistance for him there was Paolo Albera but Rinaldi later returned to his home despite Bosco making an effort to convince him to reconsider his decision. He continued his life as a farmer but received some letters from Bosco and some books from Albera regarding religious vocations and the process of discernment. In 1874 his parents welcomed Bosco who decided to visit Rinaldi but he proved to be most persistent in his decision not to continue his religious studies. Bosco's insistence at least managed to get his parents to convince to return to the school; his mother proved more vocal in this and even some people from the town also attempted to convince him. In 1876 he prepared to wed but Bosco visited him once more to convince him that he should consider the religious life instead as a more viable alternative; in November 1877 he agreed to go to the order's house at Sampierdarena as the place that Bosco referred to as a place \\"for late vocations\\". The director there at Sampierdarena was his priest friend Paolo Albera. It was a simplistic experience for Rinaldi to take on books but he learned to do so and joined the novitiate in San Benito Canaves in September 1879; he later received the cassock from Bosco himself on 20 October 1879. He made his initial profession on 13 August 1880 and he later received his ordination to the priesthood on 23 December 1882 in the Ivrea Cathedral from Archbishop Davide Riccardi. Rinaldi was of the mind not to become a priest but his superiors saw potential in him and so asked him to pursue a path to the priesthood. Bosco appointed him as the director of the house for late vocations in Mathi. Bosco showed Rinaldi in 1887 a map of Australia and told him that the Salesians would soon work there but told Rinaldi his work would be in Spain and not in Australia. In 1889 he was sent to Spain as the director of the order at Sarriá where he was set to work until 1901 while also serving as the provincial director for the order in his part of Spain from 1892 until 1901. In 1895 he began the production of the newspaper entitled \\"Lecturas Catolicas\\". On 1 April 1901 he returned to Turin as the order's vicar general during the term of Blessed Michele Rua; but in 1910 it was his old friend Albera who succeeded Rua. But Albera's death later in 1921 saw the ensuring General Chapter electing Rinaldi the Rector Major and third successor of Bosco on 24 May 1922. Rinaldi helped in the establishment of the World Federations of Past-Pupils and he also helped to organize the Salesian International Congress slated for 1911. In 1925 he undertook a series of international visits throughout Europe to nations such as Poland and France as well as returning to Spain. On 20 May 1917 he founded the Secular Institute of Don Bosco Volunteers in Ivrea and dispatched members of the order to countries such as India and Japan for the missions and other objectives. During his term the number of Salesians shot up 66 per cent from 6000 to 10000 members. Rinaldi died in mid-1931 in Turin and his remains were interred in Turin but later relocated in a Salesian-established basilica. He had suffered from heart muscle weakness from 1928 to his death. His order later received diocesan approval from the Cardinal Archbishop of Turin Michele Pellegrino on 31 January 1971 and received full pontifical approval from Pope Paul VI on 5 August 1978 right before the pontiff's death. Beatification The beatification process opened in an informative process in Turin that Cardinal Maurilio Fossati oversaw from 5 November 1947 until its closure in 1953; theologians determined his spiritual writings were in line with official doctrine and so approved them in a decree issued on 19 February 1956. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 11 June 1977 and he was therefore titled as a Servant of God. Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero oversaw an apostolic process from 1980 to 1981 and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated both processes on 25 June 1982 before receiving the Positio from the postulation in 1985. Theologians approved the cause on 14 October 1986 as did the C.C.S. on 23 December 1986 which allowed for Pope John Paul II to confirm his heroic virtue and name him as Venerable on 3 January 1987. The miracle required for his beatification was investigated and later received C.C.S. validation on 18 July 1986 before a medical board approved it on 7 June 1989; theologians followed suit on 13 October 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 19 December 1989. John Paul II approved the miracle on 3 March 1990 and later beatified Rinaldi in Saint Peter's Square on 29 April 1990. The miracle in question was the healing and regeneration of the jaw of Sister Maria Carla who was shot in the face on 20 April 1945 at the end of World War II during a conflict. The current postulator for this cause is Father Pierluigi Cameroni.

Career Bollard, a North Melbourne Junior, started at South Melbourne in the 1914 VFL season. He debuted in round 13 as a replacement for Dick Mullaly as South Melbourne's centreman and performed well enough that he kept that position when Mullaly returned. It was as a centreman that he lined up for South Melbourne in the 1914 VFL Grand Final against Carlton, before he got injured and was forced to play the rest of the game as a forward. In the final moments, with South Melbourne behind by six points, Jim Caldwell kicked the ball towards Bollard who looked set to take a mark in front of the goal posts, before Carlton's Ernie Jamieson took a game saving mark by springing onto the South Melbourne player's back. The marking contest was deemed by the umpire to have been fair, a view endorsed by the match report in The Australasian. Carlton held on to win by the one goal margin. In 1915, Bollard made nine league appearances for South Melbourne, in a season which included a stint on the sidelines when he was found guilty of \\"slinging\\" Carlton player Ted Brown during South Melbourne's round 11 loss at Princes Park. He returned in round 18, the final round of the season. After missing the entire 1916 VFL season, Bollard returned to the side midway through the 1917 season, by now playing as a defender. His final appearance for South Melbourne was that year's semi final loss to Collingwood. Death Bollard died on 18 March 1920, aged 29, in an industrial accident at a skin store on Queen Street in West Melbourne.

Life  Albera was the 6th child of a farmer family of None, a town between Turin and Pinerolo. He knew Don Bosco when he was 13 at the church of his town. On 18 October 1858 he joined the Don Bosco's youth center in Valdocco. He was among the first 22 Salesians to make religious vows. In 1863 Don Bosco sent him as assistant and teacher to the newly opened boarding school of Mirabello Monferrato, where one of his pupils was Luigi Lasagna, future Salesian missionary and bishop in Brazil. He was ordained as a priest on 2 August 1868 in Casale Monferrato. Don Bosco chose him to begin a new Salesian work in Marassi in 1871, and one year later, in 1872, the entire school and youth center was moved to Sampierdarena near Genoa in 1872. In 1875 Don Bosco opened a house for late vocations in Sampierdarena with Albera as director. It was the first place in the vocation of Philip Rinaldi who would become a good friend of Albera for the rest of his life. In 1881 he was designated superior of the Salesians for France. In 1891 he returned to Turin as a member of the general council, in the position of Catechist General (or spiritual director general). In 1900, Don Rua as special visitor to the Salesian Houses of the Western Hemisphere.  Rector Major  After the death of Don Rua in 1910, the General Chapter elected Albera as the second successor of Don Bosco. He continued the policies of Don Rua to increase the number of Salesian houses in the world. But he would face a difficult time with the World War I, when many young Salesians were brought to the armies, many of them into enemy troops of the time. One of those young Salesians was Renato Ziggiotti, his future successor. In 1913 he visited the houses of Austria, Poland, Yugoslavia, United Kingdom and Belgium and he opened a Salesian presence in Hungary. But during the war many Salesian schools were converted into fittings or hospitals. Albera began to write letters to the military units around Europe where he knew there were Salesians. But the European war did not stop the growing of the Salesian order in other continents. In 1914 he approved the opening of missions in Rio Negro (Brazil), Germany and China. In 1915 Pope Benedict XV elevated the first Salesian cardinal: Giovanni Cagliero. In 1920 the Salesians arrived to Gran Chaco in Paraguay and to Assam in India as well as Central America and Cuba. On 29 October 1921 Paolo Albera died in Turin, having been Rector Major of the Salesian Society for 11 years.

Burgher rights were restricted to white men, in particular Boers.  Terminology and origins  Historically Burgher refers to a citizen of a town or city, typically a member of the wealth bourgeoisie. (See also Burgher (title)). In South Africa, the word has its origins from the term free burghers. After the establishment of the settlement at the Cape by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) several servants were issued with free papers in 1657 relieving them from their service to the Company. These people were referred to as the free burghers. Free burgher status included privileges such as land ownership and making use of the land to farm and supply produce to the Company usually at fixed rates.https://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=1294 The free burghers who settled permanently in South Africa brought about the inception of the Boers who migrated further to the interior of South Africa. Several expansions such as the Trekboers and the Great trek led to the establishment of the Boer republics in 1852. Typically a citizen of the Orange Free State would be referred to as a 'Burgher of the Free State'. http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_burgher_notes.htm The rights to political representation and the ownership of property were collectively referred to as \\"burgher rights\\". In the Orange Free State (1854–1902), the constitution restricted burgher rights to white male residents only, though coloured people (those of mixed ancestry) did have some rights regarding property. The South African Republic, or Transvaal (1852–1902), gave burgher rights to white males only and explicitly barred their extension to \\"persons of colour\\". A bill passed in the Transvaal in 1858 permitted \\"no equality between the white and coloured inhabitants, neither in Church nor in State\\". Burghers were \\"citizen- soldiers\\" who, between the ages of 16 and 60, were obliged to serve without pay in the republic's commandos, providing their own horse and rifle, 30 rounds of ammunition and their own rations for the first ten days. Most of them were Boers.  History  The Irish Transvaal Brigade was established days before the outbreak of the Second Boer War and initially consisted of Irishmen who worked in the Witwatersrand. These volunteers were given full citizenship and became Burghers of the Boer republics. Under the leadership of John MacBride, the brigade was strengthened by volunteers traveling from Ireland via Delagoa Bay into South Africa. http://www.fak.org.za/2016/05/24/ierland-en-die-boere-1880-tot-1935/ Following the discovery of diamonds and gold in the Boer Republics and their environs in the 1870s and 1880s, white immigrants of mostly British stock began moving to the region in large numbers. The Boers referred to these people as uitlanders (out-landers). The uitlanders demanded full burgher rights in the Transvaal, but the local government under President Paul Kruger was unwilling to grant these, surmising that the sheer number of uitlanders might imperil the republic's independence. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions between the South African Republic and Britain led to the Jameson Raid of 1895–96 and ultimately the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. Following the British victory in the latter and the Treaty of Vereeniging, the Free State and the Transvaal were annexed by Britain as the Orange River Colony and Transvaal Colony. Wagon Hill Burgher Memorial The Burgher Memorial near Ladysmith were unveiled in 1979 in memory of the 781 Burghers who died during the Second Boer War.

Early life Margery Grace Blackie was born at Redbourn, Hertfordshire, on 4 February 1898, the youngest of ten children of Robert Blackie (c.1852–1936), who was independently wealthy, and his wife, Elizabeth (d. 1941), daughter of Rowland Rees, the civil engineer and Mayor of Brighton. Her uncle, by marriage, was James Compton-Burnett, a noted Homeopathic Doctor. His daughter, the novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett was a first cousin. In 1911 the family moved to London, and she was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls in Acton. Her uncle Rowland Rees was an architect and politician in South Australia. She studied medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, and qualified as a doctor in 1923. In 1924, she joined the staff at the London Homeopathic Hospital. In 1928, she received her MD from the University of London, where she was the only woman candidate. Career In 1926, encouraged by her closest friend, Dr Helena Banks, she set up her own practice at Drayton Gardens, London, by reopening a homoeopathic dispensary that had been closed for 12 years. In 1929, together with Dr. Banks, she moved to a large six-storey house at 18 Thurloe Street, South Kensington, London, where they maintained a busy homoeopathic medical practice in addition to Dr. Blackie's hospital work. She remained there until 1980, the year before her death. Dr. Blackie and Dr. Banks were both ardent Christians, and for over thirty years Banks was her \\"partner and intimate friend\\". Dr. Banks died in 1971. At the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, Blackie was an assistant physician from 1927 to 1957, and spent some of that time (1929–1937) as assistant to Dr. Douglas Borland in the Children's Department. She became senior consultant physician from 1957 to 1966. In 1968, Dr. Blackie succeeded physician Sir John Weir GCVO to become Physician to Queen Elizabeth II, the first woman to hold this position. Other notable patients include Lady Julia Namier. Dr. Blackie was admitted to the Royal Victorian Order in the rank of Commander in 1979. In 1978, it was reported that her medical bag for house calls at Buckingham Palace included \\"arsenic, strychnine, wormwood, wolfsbane, death cap mushroom, and the venom of the Gila monster, rattlesnake and hooded cobra\\", although according to the principles of homoeopathy most of her preparations would have contained practically none of the material substances for which they were named. Later life The keep, Hedingham Castle In the last year of her life, from 1980 to 1981, she lived at Hedingham Castle with the owner, her close friend and companion, Miss Musette Frances Jacqueline Natalie Majendie CBE (1903–1981), the granddaughter of Lewis Majendie MP. On 24 August 1981, she died peacefully from a stroke, and was buried on 29 August at Castle Hedingham.

Established in 1871, it is considered a Cultural Property of Indonesia. The complex is home to thousands of monkeys. History Saka Tunggal Mosque was established in 1871 CE, or 1288 hijri; the latter year is inscribed on the lone pillar in the mosque. The name of the mosque is derived from this column: saka tunggal translates as \\"lone pillar\\". The roof of the central room is made of palm tree fibers. The mosque is held to have been established by Kyai Tulih (also spelled Ki Ageng Tolih), a pioneer of the Aboge school of Islam which combined the Islamic and Javanese calendars. The site remains sacred to followers of Aboge Islam, Saka Tunggal Mosque is often used for Eid prayers by the Aboge in Banyumas. In 2004 the mosque was designated a Cultural Property of Indonesia.Sign outside the mosque It is open to tourists, but under-utilized and poorly managed. Little infrastructure has been developed to support the development of the mosque and its surrounding area as a tourist object. As such, in 2014 only 2,000 visitors were recorded. Description Interior of the mosque, showing the lone column for which it is named. One of the monkeys on the mosque grounds Saka Tunggal mosque is located in Cikakak, Wangon, Banyumas, Central Java, approximately southwest of the regency's capital Purwokerto. It is about from the main road, over a paved road which, , is badly damaged. The site lacks public toilets or other facilities for tourists. Near the mosque is a graveyard where Kyai Tulih is buried. This graveyard is surrounded by a bamboo fence and divided into three parts: the upper, middle, and lower cemetery. Each part of the cemetery has its own juru kunci (caretaker). Every year on the 26th day of Rajab, the bamboo fence (jaro in Javanese) surrounding the cemetery is replaced in a ceremony known as Jaro Rohab. Men replace the fence, beginning near the grave of Kyai Tulih then continuing on in the direction of the mosque. Meanwhile, women prepare food for a ritual known as slametan; the ceremony is done by the cemetery's three juru kunci. The Jaro Rojab ritual is intended to commemorate the Night Journey of the prophet Muhammad and to spiritually cleanse the participants. It attracts Muslims from much of Central and West Java, including representatives of the Surakarta Sunanate in Surakarta. The area around the mosque is home to thousands of monkeys. These monkeys often come to the mosque area, though they are not supposed to be fed by tourists. The monkeys are considered sacred by the local residents, and thus may not be killed or injured. During the dry season they may attack residents' homes, stealing food or other objects.

It is spread over an area of and has an average depth of . In 2010, the lake was taken over by Coimbatore Corporation on a 90-year lease from the Public Works Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Hydrography The lake is fed by canals derived from Noyyal river. The lake also receives water from Selvachinthamani lake located upstream in the north and drain water. The lake has an outlet connecting it with Valankulam lake. The water can be released through four sluice gates located on the south side of the lake. Fauna As per a study conducted in 2003–04, the lake had 36 genera of zooplankton including of 8 genera of protozoa and 6 genera of Rotifera with increased eutrophication of the lake. Species Diversity Index of zooplankton population ranged from 1.74 to 3.63 across the year with maximum before the beginning of the summer and end of South-west monsoon. As per a study on bird diversity conducted in 2013, about 48 species of avifauna belonging to 20 families were recorded. Most species were recorded in March before the start of summer and was the least in the winter months of November and December. Highest bird population was observed in the months of January and February. Various birds including little grebes, painted storks and purple moorhen can be spotted in this lake. Fishing Fishing is carried out by local fishermen and enthusiasts. In the 2000s, due to encroachment and the fishes were infected with metals and pathogens from polluted waste water discharged from the sewage. The local fishermen requested the lake to be cleaned up to ensure healthy fish population. Environmental concerns The lake became contaminated with effluents from sewage release from the city and was encroached by water hyacinth. In 2010, Coimbatore Corporation unveiled a plan to De-silt the lake and clear the encroachments. The corporation hired external consultants and suggested public-private-partnership model for the development of the lake. In 2013, the de-silting was carried out by the Coimbatore Corporation in association with NGO Siruthuli, Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore and Vijayalakshmi Charitable Trust. The restoration of the lake was funded partly by the government and partly by private corporations and the activity was carried out with the help of volunteers from public.

Luraschi was born in London at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital to Guiditta Luraschi, a native of Appiano Gentile; he was never told his father's identity. His stepfather, Genaro San Sevarino, was a restaurateur. Luraschi attended Catholic school in his childhood, and was later educated in Swiss and German boarding schools. He initially followed in his stepfather's trade, joining him in moving to the Italian Riviera to help him run a hotel catering to American tourists. Upon the recommendation of several of his American customers, Luraschi moved to America to seek work. However, he arrived in New York City during the summer of 1929, soon before the infamous \\"Black Tuesday\\" when the Wall Street Crash of 1929 put thousands out of work, and initially was unable to find a job. \\"While walking on 7th Avenue wondering what I could do to earn a living, I ran into a school chum from Switzerland. His mother was a theatrical agent who had an Italian novel called Death Takes a Holiday. She needed to have it translated. I took the job and got [paid] for my work. Paramount Pictures bought the novel. At the same time they hired me to do the sub-titles for all their films for foreign release. In fact, I helped to invent the technology for talking pictures with sub-titles. This was in New York. I became the head of operations for subtitles for Paramount Pictures, New York.\\" He was soon transferred to Paramount's Hollywood offices, where he established an international division to handle inquiries from foreign publications, and supervise foreign-based productions. Luraschi also served in a much quieter role as a frequent overseer of content in films released by Paramount. In the buildup and entry into World War II, he warned against inserting content into films that could have repercussions on Jews overseas; when Paramount produced The Hitler Gang in 1944, he alerted the studio that in one test screening, audiences were applauding anti-Semitic statements made in the film. The film scholar David N. Eldridge proposes that Luraschi, writing under the pseudonym Owen, later became a frequent correspondent with the Central Intelligence Agency, both informing them of political activities of studio talent while taking advice from them to place positive American imagery in films made at Paramount. Suggestions, such as depicting African-Americans in dignified roles to counter foreign propaganda about American race issues, or making sure American characters in foreign locales were respectful of local mores. Luraschi also reportedly claimed to have seen a naked breast during the shower scene of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho when it was previewed for studio brass, though Hitchcock insisted he only imagined it. Luraschi spent the '60's shuttling between Europe and the States, initially collaborating with Dino De Laurentiis on Italian-based productions for Paramount in Rome, then acting as assistant to president of production George Weltner in New York, then transferring to Paris to supervise production of Rene Clement's Is Paris Burning?. Luraschi was ultimately established in Rome at Mars Film Produzione, an Italian production outfit seeded by Paramount, in 1967, where he would greenlight films produced for Germany, France, Italy and Spain, and handle the release of American films in those territories. He also became VP of international production for Paramount's London offices, and often was in charge of foreign-language dubbing on behalf of their shared European distribution venture Cinema International Corporation. He retired from studio activity in 1994 at age 88. He died of natural causes in Paris at the age of 96. He had two children. His son, Tony Luraschi, directed the IRA thriller The Outsider, which was released by Paramount in 1980. His daughter Judy Starbuck Sorro is an artist and works for the city of San Francisco. He has 5 grandchildren. His grandson Tony Starbuck is a sound mixer based in New York. His grandson Joshua Starbuck is a lighting designer based in New York. His granddaughter Savanna Luraschi is a fashion executive an ordained Buddhist nun based in New York. His grandson Clay Luraschi is an executive with Topps based in New York.

The unit offers limited services for U.S. citizens in areas including Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and Lower Saxony. Despite that, services such as the issuing of visas or emergency passports are not provided, but can be obtained only from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, the Consulate General in Frankfurt or Munich. The consular agency closed permanently on December 31, 2018. History Consular relations between Bremen and the United States can be traced back far before the agency's establishment. In 1794, a Consulate, later Consulate General, was established in Bremen under the order of U.S. President George Washington, and the original charter bore his signature. Arnold Delius was appointed consul. It was one of the earliest-opened American missions on the European continent. Henry Boernstein was appointed consul in Bremen in 1861, the same year as the start of the American Civil War. Boernstein reported receiving a friendly reception from the Bremen government, but stated: > The rich merchant class of Bremen was, however, less favorable to our Union, > and I found among them a strong inclination toward the South and its efforts > at succession. This was an entirely natural result of the fact that Bremen > did almost all of its business with the southern states. In 1862, U.S. Senator Charles Sumner reported on the duties of the consul in Bremen, stating: > A large number of American vessels are constantly arriving in Bremen, > requiring the immediate attention not only of the consul himself but one or > two clerks, and since the establishment of a line of steamers between New > York and Bremen the consular duties have been largely increased by the > number of American travellers arriving and departing. In 1862, U.S. Representative Henry Winter Davis reported that Isaac R. Diller, who had served as consul from 1857 to 1861, had incurred expenses \\"for fuel, lights, clerk-hire, travel, and for the relief of destitute American citizens and seamen\\". Post-World War II A new consulate was opened in Bremen in 1956 at the President-Kennedy-Platz. Designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, its architecture demonstrated the International Style of post-war Modernism, and was honored with an award from the Association of German Architects in 1974. The six main consular offices in Germany--Berlin (consulate general), Bremen (consulate), Frankfurt (consulate), Hamburg (consulate general), Munich (consulate general), and Stuttgart (consulate)--reopened in the spring of 1946. Martin J. Hillenbrand, who served as consul from 1946–50, described how the Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067 stipulated that post-war Germany was \\"a defeated enemy nation\\" which was to be industrially disarmed and demilitarized, and that a program of restitution and reparations was to be enforced. Fraternization with German citizens and officials was also discouraged. Hillenbrand wrote: > Reality quickly caught up with abstract formulations of policy. > Nonfraternization could not stand up long in the face of the human > propensity for sympathy and affection. Moreover, the plight of the civil > population in the midst of destroyed buildings, food and fuel shortage, and > economic collapse so obviously called for help that further punishment > seemed irrelevant in what had become a battle for survival...the emphasis > inevitably shifted to the provision of minimal supplies to avoid mass > starvation. Hillenbrand described living well as part of the \\"occupation establishment\\", and stated that the consulate had \\"its own club staffed by expert German cooks and waiters who were glad to be so near good food\\". The consular car fleet included a Maybach limousine alleged to have been previously used by a senior Nazi official. During the 1960s, American buildings in West Germany became locations for anti-Vietnam War rallies, and in 1967, tomatoes and eggs were thrown at the Bremen consulate. In 1986, the Consulate General was closed after operating for centuries. In 2000, American consular presence in Bremen become the Consular Agency, and a Consular Agent acts as the head of mission. At first the office sat on the location of Bremen World Trade Center, then in 2011 it moved into its present address at Flughafenallee 18, right inside the Bremen Airport.

It survives in a verse and in a prose version. The verse version has 630 octosyllabic rhyming lines. It survives in a single manuscript, Det Kongelige Bibliotek, GKS 2061 4°, foll. 149vb-154ra (ed. Wesselofsky, 1877). The prose version is from BNF français, 24430. A critical edition of both versions was published by Coveney (1955). Dated to the second half of the 13th century, the work redeploys the motif of the \\"swan-children\\" known from earlier romances, as well as a number of episodes known from the Roman de Silence. It is the earliest known representative of the medieval cycle of legends attached to Constantine the Great.Jacques Merceron, Le message et sa fiction: la communication par messager dans la littérature française des XIIe et XIIIe siècles, Volume 128 of Modern Philology, University of California Press, 1998, p. 163. The narrative follows the following lines: Prophesy to the emperor announcing the wedding of his newly-born daughter with the newly-born son of a commoner, opposition of the emperor against this dishonorable union, attempted infanticide, abandonment and fostering of the child, rediscovery of the young Constantine, renewed attempt at having Constantine killed by sending him as a messenger bearing a \\"treacherous letter\\" (advising the recipient to kill the bearer, as in Bellerophon and Amleth), chance meeting with the emperor's daughter in the imperial gardens, substitution of the traitorous letter with one advising the marriage of the bearer to the princess, and finally the marriage of the hero and his inheritance of the realm.

It is situated approximately east of Darwin and protects a large area of eucalypt woodland and saline wetlands. The area is bounded by the Howard River to the west and Gunn Point to the east with all of Shoal Bay being found within the reserve, it also shares a common boundary with the Howard Springs Hunting Reserve and the Tree Point Conservation Area. It consists of extensive sand and mud-flats with much of the bay exposed at low tide. Numerous swamps surround the bay with remnants of a monsoon vine forest. Patches of rainforest are also found around the margins of the tidal area. The tidal flats are a known feeding and roosting area for migratory shorebirds in their non-breeding season. Aggregations of up to 5,000 waterbirds can be found in freshwater areas when the larger areas further south are dry. The area is home to three threatened species of plant: Cycas armstrongii, Ptychosperma macarthurii and Utricularia dunstaniae. The area is also home to eleven threatened species of animal including Australian bustard, red goshawk, northern quoll, flatback turtle and dwarf sawfish. The traditional owners of the area are the Larrakia peoples, several large shell middens left by these peoples can be found in the upland intrusions into the swamp areas.

It was commissioned for St Mary Redcliffe in 1755. In the 19th century attempts were made to sell it, but it was given to the Bristol Fine Art Academy, which became the Royal West of England Academy. Its size made it difficult to display and it was rolled up and stored in the basement. In 1973 it was displayed in the ecclesiastical museum created in the war-damaged Church of St Nicholas. When the museum closed it was converted to offices; however the triptych remains in the building. It is on display to the public again after the church was re-consecrated in 2018. Description The three scenes depicted are the Ascension featuring Mary Magdalene, on a central canvas which is by . It is flanked by The Sealing of the Sepulchre and the Three Marys at the Tomb each of which is by . They are mounted in gilded frames. History The painting was commissioned from William Hogarth in 1755 to fill the east end of the chancel of St Mary Redcliffe. It was Hogarth's only commission from the Church of England; he did not follow any faith. The churchwardens paid him £525 for his painting. Thomas Paty made the frames. The total cost was £7671 6s 4d. The three paintings were too wide for the church and the side panels were placed at an angle to the central one. During the Victorian era Hogarth's work was no longer thought to be suitable for the church and attempts were made to sell it to the National Gallery or via Christie's and an advertisement was placed in The Times; however no potential purchasers could be found. It was given to the Bristol Fine Art Academy, which became the Royal West of England Academy, in 1859. In 1910 another attempt was made to sell it, again without success. The work took up a great deal of display space and presented challenges for public display. It was eventually rolled up and stored in the basement. The museum officially acquired the paintings in 1955 with £500 from the Art Collections Fund. The painting is now displayed in St Nicholas, Bristol. The church was damaged by incendiary bombs during World War II and was considered for demolition in the 1950s. The building was partially restored and the roof replaced by 1964 when it was leased to The Corporation of Bristol as a museum of church artefacts and local history. It opened in 1973 and Hogarth's triptych was installed at the eastern end. The museum closed in 1991; however the painting remained within the offices of the Bristol & Region Archaeological Services.

Shields later recalled: > I paid for the horses and cameramen with cases of beer. I didn’t know how to > work a camera; they taught me how to make a film so it was like my film > school...

This power may only be exercised for conduct which either was committed or became public knowledge after the Act comes into force.Section 1(4). A member who is expelled is disqualified from becoming a member again.Section 3. This act arose from a private member's bill sponsored by Baroness Hayman and Sir George Young.  Background  Historically the House of Lords had no power to expel a member from the House, even if they had committed a criminal offence or been imprisoned. An example of this was when Lord Black of Crossharbour was imprisoned for 3 years and was placed on a leave of absence from the House but only had to give three months notice in order to return. The strongest sanction the House of Lords could issue against a peer was a suspension for the rest of the Parliamentary session. In 2009, the Committee for Privileges and Conduct issued a report suggesting that the House be granted the power to expel members. The resulting House of Lords Reform Act 2014 allowed for expulsions to be made on grounds of non-attendance or serious criminal conviction. However it was felt these powers were insufficient. The House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Bill was first introduced to Parliament as a Private Members Bill by Baroness Hayman in the House of Lords before progressing to the House of Commons where it was sponsored by Sir George Young. It received Royal Assent from Queen Elizabeth II on 26 March 2015.  Effect  The Act granted the House of Lords the power to amend their Standing Orders to allow for peers to be expelled for breaching the House of Lords code of conduct. Any peer ejected in this manner would still be entitled to keep their title. It was speculated that the power would first be used after Lord Sewel was filmed allegedly taking cocaine, however Lord Sewell resigned before the investigation could take place. The Act was cited by Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza as evidence for the House of Lords reforming.

But, it literally means – that which is not steady; and refers to error etc., caused by defects in the perceptive system. The seeing of snake in a rope in darkness, silver nacre in moonlight, water in a mirage on a hot day and a person in a stump of tree are four classic instances quoted in Vedantic texts. Bhrama is a mistake, it is a confusion about one object which exists for another object which does not exist, it merely refers to the fallibility of human perception. Human nature is ordinarily afflicted by - भ्रमप्रमादविप्रलिप्साकरणापाटवदोषाः – i.e. bhrama (false knowledge or mistakes), pramāda (inattention or misunderstanding reality), vipralipsā (cheating propensity) and karaṇa-a-pāṭava (imperfection of the senses) are four major mind-faults which mislead human beings and do not permit right perception and cognition. Amongst these, the knowledge which is of the nature of bhrama is the direct thought-wave of avidya. And, the texts speak about there being five theories of illusion or erroneous perception – Ātmakhyāti (Yogacara theory of subjective apprehension), Asatkhyāti (Madhyamaka theory of the nonexistent), Akhyāti (Prabhākara’s theory of non-apprehension), Anyathākhyati (Nyaya theory of misapprehension) and Anirvacanīyakhyāti (Advaita Vedanta theory of apprehension of the indeterminate), developed by five schools of thought. The Vedantic texts reveal the Self as Pure Consciousness; they reveal the Self as the ever blissful witness who is neither the enjoyer nor the enjoyment or the object of enjoyment. The enjoyer is Chidabhasa or Jiva, the sheath of the intellect, a product or manifestation of Maya, not transcendentally real and subject to change. Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (VII.9-10) explains:- : अधिष्ठानांशसंयुक्तं भ्रमाशमवलम्बते  : यदा तदाऽहं संसारीत्येवं जीवोऽभिमन्यते  : \\"When Jiva, having the immutable Kutastha as his basis, wrongly identifies himself with the gross and subtle bodies, he comes to think of himself as bound by the pleasures and pains of this world.\\" : भ्रमांश्स्य तिरस्कारदधिष्ठानप्रधानता  : यदा तदा चिदात्माहामसङ्गोऽस्मीति बुद्धयते  : \\"When Jiva gives up his attachment to his illusory portion, the nature of the substratum becomes predominant and he realizes that he is associationless and of the nature of pure consciousness.\\" Swami Swahananda in his commentary tells us that Kutastha, conventionally identified with ego, is not the object of identification for it is incapable of being associated with ego. According to Shankara, atma-anatma adhyasa, the so-called locus of superimposition, is a mispresentation or proksha-aproksha bhrama. Panchapadika pf Padmapada interprets purovasthitava (the object in front) as contact with the visual sense, whereas Ratnaprabha of Niścalakara relates it with sense-contact; the former explains that a non-object can become an apparent object and the latter explains that Shankara in no way considers the said locus to be complete and conclusive. Saguna (with attributes) worship leads to a typical illusion in as much as the devotee mistakes physical or mental images for the formless God; it is of the nature of the Samvadi-bhrama that finally leads to the realization of Nirguna Brahman, the endless pursuit after sense-objects is the Visamvadi-bhrama. But, the cumulative subtle awareness of bhrama need not necessarily result in the awareness of Maya because owing to the latter either one wakes up from a dream or goes on dreaming forever. Svarūpa-bhrama (illusion about spirituality) is one the four major anarthas (useless, meaningless, disastrous, wrongdoings) and is said to be of four kinds – sva- tattva which is illusion about one’s own spiritual identity, para-tattva which is illusion about the spiritual identity of the supreme absolute truth, sādhya-sādhana-tattva which is illusion about the spiritual means and the object gained, and māyā-tattva which is illusion about the Lord’s external energy. These anarthas are required to be uprooted in order to develop niśṭa (devotion). But, bhrama is not an āropa (imposing of, imputation, figurative substitution) which is an āhārya (wilfully caused in spite of falsity) cognition. The Yoga School of thought adopts the Anyathākhyati theory of misapprehension of the Nyayas for dealing with bhrama, which theory is based on the premise that bhrama is thinking of something as that which it is not, like attributing the characteristics of Prakrti to Purusha and vice versa. In Ayurveda, bhrama refers to Vertigo, a discreet disease due to Vata prakopa and Pitta prakopa which shows six distinct stages, and is curable.

It stipulates that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the next ten years after the Act comes into force, the position has to be filled by a woman, if there is one who is eligible. In this case, the Act supersedes Section 5 of the Bishoprics Act 1878, which would issue a \\"writ of summons to that bishop of a see in England who having been longest bishop of a see in England has not previously become entitled to such writ\\".http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/41-42/68/section/5/enacted It does not apply to the five sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham or Winchester, which are always represented in the House of Lords. The Act was passed half a year after the Bishops and Priests (Consecration and Ordination of Women) Measure 2014 authorised the Church of England to appoint women as bishops. The first female diocesan bishop, and thus the first female Lord Spiritual due to this Act, was Rachel Treweek in 2015. Consecrated Bishop of Gloucester on 22 July 2015 and enthroned on 19 September 2015, she joined the Lords on 7 September 2015 with the full title The Rt Rev. the Lord Bishop of Gloucester, and was introduced to the House by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London on 26 October 2015.

Since then, Christine Hardman (2016), Viv Faull (2018) and Libby Lane (2019) have also entered the Lords due to this Act shortly after becoming diocesan bishops. Therefore four out of seven vacant Lords positions occurring in the first five years of the Act have been filled by women; without the Act, none of the four women would have become a Lord Spiritual yet.

It is also used for the 15th century Ottoman chronicle Tevârih-i Âl-i Selçuk (History of the House of Seljuk, also called Oğuznâme-Selçuklu târihi by some Turkish language sources, Târih-i Âl-i Selçuk). The Ottoman chronicle, written by Yazıcıoğlu Ali in Ottoman Turkish, is the only official history of the Imperial Court from Murad II's reign and serves to establish a narrative of the Ottoman dynasty's claim of descent through the Seljuks.Islam Ansiklopedisi, Selçuknâme Selçukname of Ibn Bibi (13th century) Ibn Bibi was born as the son of refugees from Khwarazm and Khorasan who had fled their native lands following the death of the last ruler of the Khwarazmian dynasty, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu. Ibn Bibi attained a high position in the Seljuks of Anatolia as a \\"seal holder\\" and was responsible for all Seljuk correspondence. His mother had held a position in the Imperial Court of Khwarazm as an astrologer. She had managed to find a position in the court of the Seljuk sultan Kayqubad I. Thus Ibn Bibi began his service in the Seljuk Court during the reign of Kayqubad I, which continued even after the Battle of Köse Dağ, when the Sultanate of Rum, defeated by the Mongol Empire, became vassals of the Ilkhanate. Historian Ali Anooshahr has proposed that Ibn Bibi's chronicle of Seljuk history, called Selçukname, followed a common pattern that can be found in earlier chronicles written by medieval Persian historians Abu'l-Fadl Bayhaqi and Nizam al-Mulk. Anooshahr calls this pattern the \\"triad of kings\\", beginning with a ghazi founder king who lives a life of hardship as a wandering dispossessed warrior prince who \\"returns\\" to regain his throne. The second king of the triad is a ruler over ghazis during a prosperous and stable era, and the third king is depicted as a debauched and inexperienced ruler who loses the kingdom to a new group of ghazis. Selçukname of Yazıcıoğlu Ali (15th century) Authorship Yazıcıoğlu's Selçukname, listing Oghuz tamgas The author of the 15th-century Ottoman chronicle Tevârih-i Âl-i Selçuk () was Yazıcıoğlu Ali (literally \\"Ali the clerk's son\\"), who was a civil servant during the reign of Murat II. He was sent to Mamluk Egypt as an Ottoman ambassador. Other than that, there is no information about his personal life. However, there were two other Yazıcıoğlu's in the same period who are thought to be his brothers, Ahmet Bican and Mehmet Bican, and their father was Selahattin from Gelibolu (now a district center of Çanakkale Province in Turkey) who was a katip (clerk) and the author of an astrology book. Since Yazıcıoğlu means \\"son of clerk\\" the supposition about Ali's family is justified. Legitimacy of the Ottomans  In the early days of the Ottoman Empire, Ottomans suffered from accusations about their origin. Both Kadı Burhaneddin and Timur questioned Ottoman sovereignty in Anatolia. Kadı Burhaneddin made fun of the Ottomans by replacing the word kayıkçı (\\"boatman\\") instead of Kayı, the name of the Ottoman family's tribe. The Ottomans tried to prove their nobility. Murat II was especially uneasy about the accusations and Yazıcıoğlu Ali was tasked to write a book about the origin of the Ottoman family.İnalcık:Kuruluş Dönemi Osmanlı Sultanları, İSAM, , pp.19-20 The Selçukname discusses briefly the Ottoman dynasty genealogy by asserting Ottoman descent from the Seljuks of Anatolia. Selçukname is the only official history of the Imperial Court from Murad II's reign.Christine Isom- Verhaaren:Living in the Ottoman Realm: Empire and Identity, 13th to 20th Centuries, p. 68 Text There are five sections. The first section is about the pre-Islamic age of the Turks. In this section Ali claims that the Ottoman dynasty is the continuation of the legendary Oghuz Khagan.TÂRÎH-i ÂL-i SELÇÛK Published in the TDV Islâm Ansiklopedisi》vol. 40 (2011)》pp.72-73 in Istanbul Karluks, Uygurs and Kypchaks (medieval Turkic people) were also mentioned in this section. The second section is about the Seljukid Empire.The third section is actually a translation of Ibn Bibi's book.Ali Anooshahr:The Ghazi Sultans and the Frontiers of Islam, Routledge (2009) The fourth section is about Keyqubad I (1220–1237) of the Seljuks of Anatolia and Osman I (1298–1326) of the Ottomans. The last section is a summary of Anatolia after the death of Gazan Khan of the Mongols.(1304) The 15th century Ottoman Selçukname includes within it a 65 line Oğuzname fragment, so the latter term may occasionally be used by scholars to refer to this text.Necati Demir, Oğuz Kağan Destanı Dede Korkut Kitabı/Kitab-ı Dedem Korkut Oğuz Kahramanlık Destani ve Kitab-ı KorkutMetin Karadağ, Türk halk edebiyatı anlatı türleri, 1995 p.134 Yazıcıoğlu Ali uses the term Oğuzname in the text in reference to earlier Uyghur language texts, and it is possible the author made use of these Uyghur language texts. These earlier texts, attested to in multiple medieval sources from the Ottoman period, have not survived into the present day.Oğuzname Some of the names from the Book of Dede Korkut, considered to be one genre of Oğuzname, are repeated in the Selçukname.Ziya Gökalp, Altın Işık Ali Anooshahr has written that certain aspects of Ibn Bibi's earlier work were modernized and updated with 15th-century terminology such as top (cannon ball) and tüfek (gun), whereas the original 13th century Persian language text had used the term manjaniq (siege engine).

It began in 2003 when Nisha Sharma accused her prospective groom, Munish Dalal, of demanding dowry. The case got much coverage from Indian and international media. Nisha Sharma was portrayed as a youth icon and a role model for other women. The case ended in 2012, after the court acquitted all accused. The court found that she had fabricated the dowry charges to wriggle out of the wedding.Rebel bride’s dowry charge junked, Aniruddha Ghosal, TNN,Mar 1, 2012 Background In 2003, Nisha Sharma was a 21-year old software engineering student. Munish Dalal was a 25-year-old engineer who worked as a lecturer of computer science in a local college. In order to arrange a suitable marriage for Nisha, her parents (Dev Dutt and Hemlata) placed a matrimonial advertisement in a newspaper. This is a very common practice in India. Munish Dalal's widowed mother Vidya Devi Dalal was among those who responded to the advertisement and contact was first established between the families in this way. After meeting each other a few times and exchanging information, the families decided that Munish and Nisha were compatible and agreed that they be married. The couple were duly engaged and the wedding was scheduled to be held on 11 March 2003 in Noida, where the bride's family lived. Nisha Sharma's father Dev Dutt Sharma was the owner of a car battery manufacturing plant in Noida, and the family was affluent. They had purchased wedding gifts for their daughter that were typical of their society: a refrigerator, a washing machine, a microwave oven and a television set. They made the usual arrangements for the wedding, both sides invited their friends and relatives, and the wedding day dawned. However, the wedding was not destined to be held. Bride's version According to Nisha and her parents, what happened was as follows. They claim that when the groom's procession reached the venue and were being welcomed, Dalal's mother demanded (about ) more in cash and a Maruti Esteem car from the bride's father. Dev Dutt Sharma expressed his inability to meet these demands, whereupon the Dalal family began verbal abuse. When the Sharma family reacted, a scuffle broke out and Mr. Sharma was slapped by Mrs. Dalal and spat upon by Mr. Dalal's sister. Upon hearing of this, Nisha Sharma called the police. Groom's version The groom's family have an entirely different version. There was absolutely no dispute or talk regarding dowry. In Indian weddings, the groom mounts a white horse and goes in a ceremonial procession to the wedding venue. The horse is mounted only a short distance from the wedding venue, for obvious practical reasons, and the procession travels only a few hundred yards. When the Dalal family arrived at the place where the horse was to be mounted, there was nobody from the bride's family to welcome them. After waiting for some time, the Dalals sent a relative to the wedding venue to find out what was the reason for the delay. The relative found that there was some commotion at the wedding venue, but he was told that everything is OK and that he should go back to the horse-venue and wait for a few minutes. As he was returning, he was followed and overtaken by an agitated man who then accompanied him to the horse-venue. There, the agitated man introduced himself as Navneet Rai and made a shocking disclosure. He informed the Dalal family that he was the husband of Nisha Sharma, and that they had been in love with each other for a long time. Just as he had finished saying this much, Nisha's father and a few other relatives arrived at the scene. The groom was one who called police when Sharma's father assaulted the groom's mother. They claimed that the wedding was disrupted by Navneet Rai, not by them. Rai had allegedly arrived at the venue with some of his friends and told the groom's mother that Nisha Sharma was already married to him. Following this Sharma's father had allegedly assaulted the groom's mother with a sandal and bit her. Sharma's father denied the allegation saying that he had a video recording to prove his statements. The procession was sent back. The groom (Munish Dalal) and several members of his family were arrested from their residence in Vikaspuri the next day and police began searching for other absconding relatives. The groom's mother, Vidya Dalal, was arrested on 15 May. Soon thereafter, Navneet Rai, a classmate of Sharma, came forward claiming to be having a relationship with her for 5 years and having married her secretly. Nisha Sharma's father said that Rai was simply maligning their name. He said that Nisha was initially interested in marrying Rai, but he had opposed the marriage as Rai was unemployed and was seeking to live off their money. He also said that after rejection Rai has misbehaved with Nisha and Nisha had written a complaint to the college which resulted in the expulsion of Rai. Media attention and reactions Following the arrest, the story got much attention from Indian and international media. The news appeared on the front-page of several newspapers. Sharma also received several marriage proposals from across the nation. Her house was visited by several media persons seeking her interview. She was also visited by women rights activists, neighbours and other well-wishers to congratulate her. A political party invited her to contest in the local election. In an interview with Ehtashamuddin Khan of Rediff, Nisha Sharma said she had no intention of joining politics, and that she wanted to continue her studies and wished her future marriage to be an arranged marriage. James Brooke writing for The New York Times, detailed how dowry is being disguised as gifts as dowry was illegal. The story was also covered by Christiane Amanpour for 60 Minutes which contained an overview of the dowry system in India, the anti- dowry laws, bride burning and female foeticide. Smriti Kak writing for The Tribune criticised the father and the bride for agreeing to the dowry initially and stopping the marriage only when the demands got too high. The incident was also captured in an Amul Butter Girl cartoon. Brinda Karat, a left-wing politician and activist, said that the parents had sent the wrong signal by agreeing to too many gifts initially. Ranjana Kumari, a women rights activist, said that she does not attend weddings because dowry is given in almost all of them, and that dowry is the cause of the female foeticide in India as parents see a girl child as an economic burden. Jyotsna Chatterji, another women right's activist, said that this one protest had given courage to other women to come forward.. None of these media, activists or politicians provided any statements after court acquitted the accused in this false case. Nisha Sharma's marriage On 19 November 2003, Nisha Sharma married Ashwini Sharma, a computer engineer, in a small ceremony in Noida with only 75 guests. The marriage was set up by a common family friend and the engagement took place on September 2003. Her father only gifted her a gold necklace as the bridal gift. The marriage was scheduled to be held on the evening of 19 November. But, it was held on 3:00 am on 19 November to avoid legal hassles. Munish Dalal and Navneet Rai had approached the court to delay the marriage. Appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show In January 2004, Nisha Sharma, her husband and her brother were invited by Oprah Winfrey to her talkshow. Oprah told her audience that they were lucky to be born in the United States, and covered the dowry issue by calling it \\"right out of the Dark Ages\\". Mention in school textbook In 2004, when the case was still under trial, the incident was included the English textbook for Class 6, by the State Council of Educational Research and Training of the New Delhi region, in the form of a chapter titled Man in Jail over Dowry Demand. It was adopted from a newspaper article from May 2003. Munish Dalal sent a defamation notice to the State Council of Educational Research and Training. Later, Vidya Dalal, the groom's mother and a retired school teacher, said the book was being taught her in her former school and it had ruined her reputation. The family's lawyer, Roopesh Kumar Sharma, said that they were suing the Delhi government and education department. The cartoon in the book showed Munish being arrested from the marriage venue, when he was actually arrested from his home. The lawyer also said that Vidya Dalal was being denied her pension and retirement benefits. Trial and verdict A case was filed in the Sector 24 police station of the Noida, against Dalal, his mother Vidya Dalal and his aunt Savitri Sharma. While awaiting trial in mid-May 2003, Munish Dalal was assaulted by other inmates in Dasna jail, who him called a greedy groom. Dalal suffered some injuries as a result. Dalal's lawyer filed an appeal with the National Human Rights Commission of India. Dalal had counter-sued accusing Nisha Sharma of adultery and bigamy. On 29 February 2012, a district court in Gautam Budh Nagar district acquitted Dalal and his family due to lack of evidence supporting the charges. The court also acquitted Navneet Rai, who had been accused of forging the marriage documents by Nisha. The court held the documents circulated by Navneet Rai could not be proven to be forged by the prosecution. Aftermath of the verdict In various interviews after the verdict, Munish Dalal said that the father had been aware of the Nisha's marriage to Navneet Rai, but he still published an ad in a newspaper. Nisha Sharma had married to Rai on 14 February 2003 secretly in a temple. On 11 May 2003, when the groom's procession arrived at the venue, they were turned away. While they were returning, they found a complaint had been filed against them.

Recording and production It was produced by Ged Foley and Patrick Street, and recorded at the following studios: * Peach Fork Studios, Pomeroy, Ohio - engineered by Bernie Nau; * Éiníní Studio, Naas, County Kildare - engineered by Steve Cooney; * Navessa Studios, Saugerties, New York - engineered by Chris Anderson; * Cal Scott Music, Tigard, Oregon - engineered by Cal Scott.Sleeve notes from Street Life, GLCD 1222, 2002. The regular band members (Andy Irvine, Kevin Burke, Jackie Daly, Ged Foley) were joined by Steve Cooney (percussion), Gay Dalzell (harmony vocals), Matt McElroy (banjo), Bruce Molsky (fiddle), Bernie Nau (piano) and Cal Scott (alto horn & cornet). The album was arranged by Patrick Street, except for brass arrangements by Cal Scott. Critical reception Street Life received positive reviews from folk music critics. In Green Man Review, Pat Simmonds said the following: *\\"A cursory glance through the running order reveals a list of tunes common enough to the tradition, yet typically for Patrick Street the versions are lesser known and arranged with a beautiful easygoing feel which gives them both a sense of familiarity and a new breath of life.\\" *\\"This album seems almost irrelevant given the modern Celticisms of the brave new wave but these old hands weave through a variety of styles with assurity and utter authority.\\" *\\"The individual maturity of each player shines through clearly as does the sophistication of the arrangements. Ultimately, nothing gets in the way of the music. There isn't a note out of place and the pacing of the tunes comes like a breath of fresh air.\\" *\\"The production qualities give a warm and personal feel to the music which result in a very satisfying listening experience.\\" In a review for Roots World, Jamie O'Brien stated: *\\"The 10 tracks are evenly split between songs and instrumentals; and the mix in material - traditional and contemporary, well-known and lesser- heard - is also well-balanced.\\" *\\"Patrick Street provides an instrumental cross-section of rhythms. From the opening set of jigs, through a set of reels, then later, hornpipes until the band hits a set of Kerry slides and polkas before ending the album with a jig and pair of reels.\\" *\\"The arrangements have a diversity that allows the individual musicianship to come through, yet still maintain a distinctive group sound. The production, while clean and crisp, is warm and mellow.\\" *\\"On the one hand, there is no album by Patrick Street that I don't like. On the other, I tend to play the earlier ones much more frequently than the later releases. Street Life heralds a change. Time will tell, but I think they've possibly released a classic with this one.\\" In his review for Rambles, Nicky Rossiter added that: *\\"The wide appeal of the group may be gathered from their travels. This particular CD was recorded in Ohio, Kildare, New York and Oregon. It opens with a set of traditional jigs that will set you in the mood for the album.\\" *\\"They return to the Irish landscape and the traditional for \\"Green Grow the Laurels.\\" The vocals are beautiful on this song of loss and longing with a quiet delivery that seems so sincere. Alongside these vocal offerings you get hornpipes, jigs, reels, slides and polkas on this excellent album.\\" *\\"The lyrics are included and there are nice liner notes on the origins of the songs or how the band members found them.\\" *\\"This is a very valuable addition to any Irish music collection.\\" In a review for Allmusic, Gregory McIntosh concluded: *\\"As always, the musicianship between the four members of Patrick Street is impeccable, the songs are well-recorded, and the occasional contemporary songs fit in nicely with the central traditional material.\\" *\\"Overall, Street Life is a nice extension to the Patrick Street catalog, but necessary only to collectors, as the album breaks little new ground for the band.\\" Track listing # \\"Saddle the Pony\\"/\\"The Boys of the Town\\"/\\"The Frost is All Over\\" (jigs) (Trad.

Bovie (September 11, 1882 – January 1, 1958) was an American scientist and inventor. He is credited with conceptualizing the field of biophysics and with inventing a modern medical device known as the Bovie electrosurgical generator. Bovie taught or conducted research at Harvard University, Northwestern University, Jackson Laboratory and Colby College. Biography Bovie was son of Henrietta Barnes Bovie and physician William Bovie. He worked as a stenographer while he saved money to attend college. Bovie went to Albion College before transferring to the University of Michigan to finish his undergraduate degree. He earned a master's degree from the University of Missouri. While in Missouri, he met his future wife, Martha Adams. The couple had one son. In 1914, he completed a Ph.D. in plant physiology from Harvard University. Before working with electrocautery, Bovie conducted research with radium at Harvard. Later in life, he suffered from painful hand problems as a result of the radium exposure during this period. Bovie's work was not the first with electricity in surgery. It was known, for example, that electric current above certain frequencies could cut tissue without inducing muscular contraction. Bovie used such knowledge to create his electrosurgical device and he first employed it in neurosurgical cases with Harvey Cushing, known as the father of neurosurgery. Bleeding had been the significant obstacle in neurosurgery until Bovie and Cushing began to employ the device in 1926. An electrosurgical unit in use during a modern surgery Bovie's device allowed Cushing to reexplore operations in patients with brain masses that had been declared inoperable. While the device revolutionized surgery, there were occasional technical problems. Cushing recalled an instance in which the current from Bovie's device short circuited through a retractor. Electricity traveled up Cushing's arm and to his headlight, an experience that Cushing described as \\"unpleasant to say the least.\\" In another case, the Bovie device briefly ignited ether gas that was being given to a patient during surgery. Known as the founder of the field of biophysics, Bovie chaired the new biophysics department at Northwestern University after his relatively brief association with Cushing. He received the John Scott Medal in 1928 for his development of the electrosurgical device. He was made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Bovie later worked at Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and at Colby College. As he was not motivated by financial gain, Bovie had sold the patent rights to his electrosurgical device to a manufacturer for one U.S. dollar. He was relatively poor in his later life. His longtime struggle with obesity had led to health problems, including diabetes and arthritis. He died on January 1, 1958. References  External links  * William T. Bovie papers, 1890-1953.

About The film contains archival footage from the 21st-century recession paired with \\"comedic send-ups\\" from Brand, conducted in the financial districts of London and New York. In one scene in the film, Brand attempts to confront Lord Rothermere, the billionaire owner of the Daily Mail, about his \\"non-dom\\" tax status, through which he avoids paying taxes in the United Kingdom by claiming residence elsewhere. When Brand rings the bell at Rothermere's London mansion and asks through the intercom to speak to him, he is told by an unseen person that Rothermere does indeed live there. Winterbottom stated that the film will explore why \\"nothing has changed\\" since the economic crisis in 2008. \\"It's about inequality and why the 1 percent (of the world's wealthy) seem to have so much and the rest of us not quite so much,\\" Winterbottom told the BBC in October 2014. \\"Everyone knows about equality and what's going on in the world, so the idea is to point out the ludicrous extremes of our society.\\" The documentary began shooting in October. Winterbottom and Brand had previously discussed—but ultimately abandoned—the idea of producing a film version of Brand's first memoir, My Booky Wook. Distribution and release The film is produced by Winterbottom's Revolution Films company and distributed by StudioCanal UK. The Emperor's New Clothes debuted in London on 21 April 2015, followed by a question-and-answer session with Brand. It made its international debut in the Spotlight Category on 24 April at the Tribeca Film Festival.

He rapes her and forcefully makes her remain silent. Azar (Feroze Khan), who is a cousin of Numair, is keen to marry her, but after being raped by Numair she is reluctant thinking that he might be the same as Numair. Rameen discloses to her parents that she is being harassed by Numair to which her mother asks her to keep it as a secret as it could affect her sister's marital life. Numair attacks his father-in- law (Manzoor Qureshi) as he comes to know of everything. Rameen's father suffers from a heart attack and passes away. Rameen then agrees to marry Azar after which she tries to tell her husband the truth about Numair but he, along with everyone else, thinks that she is lying as Rameen's mother lies to everyone that Rameen is suffering from a disease and needs medical attention as she wanted to save her daughter minal's house. Later, her mother dies & Azar, Minal and Numair throw her out of the house and she is made to live in the servant quarters. No one believes her to be innocent. Rameen then leaves the house quietly. She lives in a private women hostel, where she meets a girl who sells girls for money. Rameen doesn't know about it but when she gets to know about it, she gets out of the car in which that girl was going to sell her. There, she meets Sheraz. Sheraz's is a widower with three daughters.

Contract Farming In this contract farming concept the company provides Chicks, Feed, Healthcare and Technical support. The Farmer's responsibility is to have a poultry shed and manage it effectively. So farmers are able to get secured regular income from Suguna. The 90's In the year of 1990-97 the company grew gradually. In 1997 the company got first sizable turnover of 7 crores. Expanded their business all over Tamil Nadu and started professionalizing the company. At the end of 90's they got turnover of 100 crores. Year 2000 In the year of 2000 the founders moved into the neighboring states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. They found an ally in several state governments due to their objective to Energize Rural India. They overcame the opposition of the middlemen with the help of farmers and the respective state governments. 2000 – present Over a period of 35 years, Suguna has gone from strength to strength and has become a Rs.8700 crore company that makes it India's No.1 broiler producer in India . Along the way, Suguna's pioneering efforts in contract farming helped create thousands of rural entrepreneurs who share the growth successfully. \\"Poultry Integration\\" introduced and pioneered by Suguna in the country has energized the livelihoods of farmers in rural India. Suguna ranks among the top ten poultry companies worldwide. With operations in 16 states across India, it offers a range of poultry products and services. The fully integrated operations cover broiler and layer farming, hatcheries, feed mills, processing plants, vaccines and exports. Suguna markets live broiler chicken, value added eggs and frozen chicken. With the intent to provide consumers with fresh, clean and hygienic packed chicken, Suguna has set up a chain of modern retail outlets. Today, the company's brand Suguna Chicken is a household name in India. With its Suguna Daily Fressh outlets, Suguna Home Bites, Suguna Anytime processed chicken and four varieties of specialty Suguna value added eggs, Suguna is the undisputed leader in poultry products. Suguna Home Bites being the latest in its product range is a new category of home meal replacements .

In this role, they amassed \\"one of the largest personal fortunes in the medieval Arab east\\" (Thierry Bianquis). As its nisba shows, the family hailed from the village of Madharaya near Wasit in lower Iraq. The first member to rise to prominence was Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i, who in 879 was named controller of finances by the autonomous ruler of Egypt and Syria, Ahmad ibn Tulun (reigned 868–884), a post he kept until his death in 884. He named his sons Ali and Abu Ali al-Husayn as his representatives in Egypt and Syria respectively. Ali succeeded his father and became vizier under Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun (r. 884–896) and during the brief reign of Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh, along with whom he was murdered in 896. He was in turn succeeded as fiscal director by his son Abu'l-Tayyib Ahmad (died 915), while another son, Abu Bakr Muhammad served as vizier to the penultimate Tulunid ruler, Harun ibn Khumarawayh (r. 896–904). Following the end of the Tulunid dynasty and the re-imposition of direct Abbasid control over their domains in 904–5, many of the family and its followers were deported to Baghdad, but al-Husayn, who had maintained contacts with the Abbasid court, was appointed in charge of the Egyptian finances. The family now became involved in factional struggles between the leading bureaucratic factions in Baghdad, siding with the opposition to the Banu'l-Furat clan. Its fortunes fluctuated as a result. In 913, al-Husayn was moved once more to Syria, while his nephew Abu Bakr Muhammad took over in Egypt, but both were dismissed in 917. Al-Husayn again served as financial director of Egypt in 919–922, and for a third and final time (along with Syria) from 926 until his death in 929. The last important representative of the family, al-Husayn's nephew Abu Bakr Muhammad, took over the direction of Egyptian finances in 930–933, under the governorship of his friend Takin al-Khazari. In 936 he tried without success to oppose the takeover of Egypt by Muhammad ibn Tughj, and was imprisoned. Released in 939, he played a leading role in the governance of the new Ikhshidid state until his dismissal in 946, after Ibn Tughj's death. He retired into private life, and died in 957.

Life  Al- Husayn was a son of Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i, who in 879 founded the family's fortunes when he was named controller of finances by the autonomous ruler of Egypt and Syria, Ahmad ibn Tulun.

The majority of the Burmese population is made of profess Theravada Buddhism and only 6% practices Christianity, with two-thirds of them being considered Protestant. Almost half of these Protestants are Baptist. The LBA mainly serves the Chin people who speak Falam dialect. It is one of the twenty eight associations of Chin Baptist Convention which is under the umbrella of Myanmar Baptist Convention (MBC). As of 2015, the association has 78 pastors and 21305 members . The association is divided into 12 areas and each area has their own by-law and constitution, but they work together with each other in unity in the context of LBA, encouraging and resourcing each other. The motto is Pitlin Lam Pan (Epsesians 4:14).  Background  Lairawn is a Chin version of today's Kalay Valley, Myanmar. The rich agriculture land and its climate made is possible to grow crops for the whole year. The area has a good transport link with the rest of the country and it is also an industrial area. Since it is a good place for living, the Chin people of Myanmar started to migrate to the area as early as 1915. The mass migration started after the Second World War. As the population of Chin people are increasing, Churches were established throughout the area. Each Protestants denomination such as Methodist and Baptist established churches respectively. Baptist Churches were also established independently in the area as early as 1952. The then Baptist Church pastors saw the need of an association to uplift their moral and spiritual supports. Thus, they formed the Kalay Valley Baptist Association (KVBA) for all of the Baptist churches in the area, regardless of the languages. Since, there were many different dialect within the KVBA, Burmese language were used for Church services. All of the Baptist churches in the area were under the KVBA until 1989. Lairawn also known as Kalay Valley As more Chin people migrated and the community grew stronger, the people wanted to worship in their own dialect. The villages which the Falam people live during 1945–1955 in Kalaymyo are Thiamthi, Angteng, Vanbaal, Pamunchaung, Chaungkhuah, Myaungsone, Myaunghlah, Cicai, Sentaw, Tuanchaung, Sadaw, Cekan, Taungphila, Tahan, Hmunlai and Pinkhung. At this time, Falam people have affiliation with Falam Baptist Association. As there are many different dialects among the Chin i.e. Falam, Hakha, Tedim etc... several associations were formed on the basis of their particular dialect. In 1990, the people who use Falam dialect broke away from the Kalay Valley Baptist Association (KVBA) and formed Lairawn Baptist Association (LBA). Hakha formed their own association called Chin Baptist Association and the KVBA remains as it was but its member were mainly Tedim dialect speakers. The LBA has just celebrated its Silver Jubilee in 2015.  The Formation of LBA   Christian History in Chin Hills and Kalay Valley  The Kingdom of Burma fell under the British Empire in AD 1885. The whole Chin State also conquered by the British in AD 1890. From the beginning of 1889, the American Baptist International Ministries and Karen Evangelists came to Chin Hills to start a Christian mission. As a result, the Chin people became Christians and are growing by the tireless effort of the missionaries. When the Chin people started to migrate into Kalay Valley, the established Baptist churches independently.  The Formation of KVBA  In 1952, pastor Thuam Khan Do was sent by Tedim Baptist Association to be a minister for the Chin army in Kalay valley. At that time, Pastor Ir Lian was at Taungphila, Pastor Ngo Kam was at Thing Unau, Pastor Hrin Cung Nung was at Pyinkhonegyi, Pastor Za Kheng was at Myaungsone, and they were visiting the churches around the villages in Kalaymyo. Rev. S.T Haugo M.R.E class of 1950 from Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, Penn USA advised Rev. Thuam Khan Do \\"You, Tedim people, Falam people, Hakha people, who live at Kalay valley, should be forming an association. We are different, but we are one body in Christ. You, Kalay Valley, will be the strongest in that way\\". Rev. Thuam Khan Do then invited the churches from the area and they agreed to form an Association. Therefore, Rev. Thuam Khan Do was called the Founding Father of the association. The Baptist churches from Chin State were affiliated with the Baptist churches from Kalay valley, Kalamyo area. Because of existing some difficult relationship with Chin State, the meeting was set up at Taungphila Baptist on January 16, 1955 for regarding to form a new association by the advice of some reliable thinkers. And then, the Chin people from the area had decided to have an association. The association consisted of the churches from Taungphila, Thing Unau, Pinkhung, Kalaymyo, Myaungsone, Cicai, Sentaw, and Varpi. The association is named as Kalay Valley Baptist Association. Most churches were administered by KVBA until 1989.  The birth of Lairawn Baptist Association (LBA)  In the late 1980s, the Falam people from Kalay Valley Baptist Association arranged to have their own association. They thought that they would have their own Bible, Hymnal books, and Sunday School lessons if they could have their own association. During the Falam Chin Literature annual meeting at Pinkhung Baptist Church on 5 April 1989, the Association Commission was formed. The Commission held a mass meeting at Haikhawl Baptist Church on 22 December 1989 to discuss the formation of a new association. Two delegates from each Baptist church in the area and all pastors were invited to the meeting. There, they agreed to form a new association called Lairawn Baptist Association. U Mang Kulh offered his house rent free for the association office for one year. The open ceremony of the office, U Mang Kulh's house, was held on March 1, 1990. Today, Lairawn Baptist Association has 62 churches in the Kalay Valley and its area is divided into 12 Areas. LBA HQ in Kalaymyo, Myanmar  The Founding of Bethel Theological Seminary (BTS)  The history of BTS and LBA cannot be separated. The BTS was founded by Rev. Billy Saw Ling and Dr. Za Hlei Thang. The idea of founding a seminary was envisioned anew by Rev. Billy Saw Ling. He discussed his vision with Rev. En Thang on the morning of 1 April 1989 which was the starting point of BTS. The matter was further discussed on 4 April 1989 at Pyinkhonekyi Baptist Church, during the annual meeting of Falam Chin Christian Literature Society. Then, a further meeting was held at Falam Chin Christian Literature Society office, Tahan-Kalaymyo on the first week of April 1989. The meeting was attended by Rev. Bil Saw Ling, Rev. Hrang Cung Nung, Rev. Bernard Luai Hre, and Rev. L. Sang Hlei Khuai and they decided to establish a Seminary. Dr. Za Hlei Thang offered his real estate in Tahan-Kalaymyo for Seminary. The proposal for the establishment of a seminary was put to a vote and passed unanimously, and Bethel Theological Seminary (BTS) was chosen as the official name. Thus, the Seminary was opened on June 13, 1989 with twenty-six students and five teachers (Five faculty members). BTS Main Building Bethel Theological Seminary started a program of Theological studies at the Diploma level in 1989, Bachelor of Theology (B.Th program) in 1992, Master level, Master of Theology in 2007, and Master level Master of Divinity program in 2010 with English as a medium of instruction. Bethel Theological Seminary becomes one of accredited member Institution of the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia (ATESEA) in 2000. In 2011, the Seminary was re-accredited by the ATESEA. The owner of the Bethel Theological Seminary is the Lairawn Baptist Association.

It is the causal agent of one of the most widespread diseases affecting grasshoppers. This is sometimes known as summit disease because infected insects climb to the upper part of a plant and grip the tip of the stem as they die; this ensures widespread dispersal of the fungal spores. The fungus is a species complex with several different pathotypes, each one of which seems to be host-specific to different subfamilies of grasshoppers. The pathogen is being investigated for its possible use in biological pest control of grasshoppers. Taxonomy E. grylli is a species complex which in North America includes the pathotypes E. macleodii and E. calopteni, and in Australia E. praxibuli. The different pathotypes can be distinguished by the formation or lack of formation of primary conidia, the size and the number of nuclei in the conidia, their isozyme profiles, the host species involved, and the geographical range in which they are found. They all attack grasshoppers, but it is not known whether all grasshopper species are susceptible to infection. Each pathotype seems to be host-specific to certain grasshopper subfamilies. Life cycle E. calopteni only produces resting spores, which are available to infect grasshoppers the following year. E. macleodii and E. praxibuli produce both resting spores and asexual conidia. Large numbers of conidia are produced under wet, humid conditions, and several cycles of infection can then occur in a single season. After landing on a potential host, a conidium produces a germ tube which can grow through the cuticle into the hemocoel; once there, it produces amoeboid protoplasts. These are cells without cell walls and seem to elude the insect's immune system. They multiply and kill the host. In some members of the species complex, they develop hyphae with cell walls and grow through the cuticle, producing conidiophores and infective conidia. In these and other members of the species complex, they also have an intermediate stage producing resting spores with cell walls. After the insect cadaver has fallen to the ground, the resting spores overwinter in the soil. A portion of them germinate in the spring, producing other spores that are forcibly ejected from the soil, landing on low vegetation where they come into contact with grasshoppers. They penetrate through the cuticle, proliferate and develop rapidly, the infected insect dying within about one week. At an advanced stage of the disease, an infected individual climbs to the top of a plant and dies with its limbs gripping the stem and its head pointing upwards. Some resting spores remain dormant in the soil for two or more years. Epizootic outbreaks of disease in grasshopper populations in North America have been attributed to E. grylli but are usually localised and sporadic rather than widespread. They have been credited with ending many outbreaks of grasshopper species over the decades. Use in biological control In western Canada and the western United States, grasshoppers are estimated to cause over $400 million economic damage each year to crops and rangeland. From 1986 to 1992 an integrated pest management program was initiated by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to attempt to control grasshopper numbers without the use of vast quantities of insecticide. The inclusion of the E. grylli complex in the program was investigated. A disadvantage to its use is that the fungus cannot be mass-produced and its effectiveness depends on the weather conditions (more grasshoppers are infected in warm, moist conditions). Attempts to control grasshoppers with this fungus have been largely ineffective; insects can be successfully infected by injecting them with the pathogen, but introduction of North American pathotypes into Australia and vice versa have failed to establish long term infections. The pathogen has potential for biological control of grasshoppers but more research is needed.

The club's name was commonly abbreviated to ESSMG Lyon. The club is now dissolved.  History  The club, affiliated to the parish patronage of France's Gymnastics and Sports Sponsorships Federation, and then to the Sports Federation of France, is best known for its good performance in the top-tier level basketball championship of France, in the decade of 1940s. The club included several renowned players, including Robert Busnel and André Buffière. The club was formed in 1946, following the demise of FC Grenoble (French champion in 1943 and 1944), and the move of most of its staff to ESSMG Lyon. Robert Busnel led the club to win the championship title in France, against Championnet, which was led by Henri Lesmayoux; in the French championship finals, on May 25, 1946, at the Palais des sports.

The siege ended a few hours later on 28 March, after a special forces unit of the Somali Armed Forces stormed the premises, recaptured it, and killed all five of the attackers. According to the Ministry of Information, around 20 people died during the standoff, including the perpetrators, security forces, hotel security guards and some civilians, with around 28 wounded. The special forces also rescued more than 50 hotel guests. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud ordered an investigation into the attack, and the Ministry of Information announced that the federal government was slated to pass new laws to curb illicit firearms. On 8 May, the Makka al-Mukarama hotel officially reopened after having undergone renovations.  Incident  On 27 March 2015, Al-Shabaab insurgents attacked the Hotel Makka Al Mukarama in Mogadishu. After a left-hand drive Toyota Noah laden with an improvised explosive device detonated, five armed militants penetrated the grounds in another vehicle. The blast shattered the mirrors inside the hotel. A number of government officials were staying at the hotel at the time, which was also patronized by foreigners. The attackers stormed into the hotel room levels on the first, second and third floors, and held several occupants hostage. Hotel guests locked themselves in their rooms and notified the security forces of their location. Security agents with the National Intelligence and Security Agency's elite Gaashaan unit subsequently stormed the grounds and began engaging the militants. The ensuing standoff lasted four hours. The security forces succeeded in rescuing more than 50 hotel guests, including Somalia's Ambassador to Germany Mohamed Tifow, who was saved by ladder. According to government representatives, all five of the attackers were killed, including both the gunmen and the suicide car bomber. Somali Minister of Information Mohamed Hayir Maareeye also indicated that four government soldiers, four hotel guards and five civilians were slain, as well as a female Ministry of Finance advisor, and World Bank official Farhiya Bashir Nur, who had been serving as a consultant to the Central Bank of Somalia. Somalia Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Office in Geneva, Switzerland, Yusuf Mohamed Ismail (\\"Bari-Bari\\"), was rushed to the hospital, and later died of the injuries he had sustained. Casualties included 28 wounded soldiers, state officials and hotel personnel. The Information Minister suggested that Al-Shabaab had intended to hold up the Makka al- Mukarama hotel for days and kill many civilians as they had previously done at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013, but Somali government forces succeeded in quashing their plans. The hotel's owner Gurey Abdi Hassan partly blamed Hodan district officials and state forces for the attack. He indicated that the local Hodan district commissioner had ignored his request to set up a security checkpoint in the hotel's rear, while simultaneously providing lax security despite the premises having been attacked three times before. Al- Shabaab concurrently claimed responsibility for the raid, with the group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mahamud Rage emailing that some militants had survived the attack and escaped the scene. Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab also indicated that the insurgents were targeting government officials only and had left civilians unharmed. Government forces displayed the bodies of the slain militants at a press gathering, deeming the counter-terrorist operation a success. Government forces and AMISOM troops subsequently cordoned off roads flanking the hotel. On 29 March 2015, the Ministry of Security also chaired a meeting in the Maka Al-Mukarrama hotel, where National Intelligence and Security Agency officials, National Women Association representatives, clerics and civil society members discussed ways to strengthen security, prevent terrorist attacks, and rapidly defuse them should they occur. The Ministry of Information concurrently announced that the federal government was slated to pass new laws to curb illicit firearms in the capital. On 29 March, a state funeral for Ambassador Ismail was held in his birthplace Garowe, the administrative capital of the autonomous Puntland regional state. The funeral service was attended by Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali and federal government delegates.  Reactions  President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud commended the security forces for their competence, described the attack as futile and spineless, and vowed to continue the ongoing reconstruction and development process unimpeded. He also instructed the national security agencies to immediately launch a probe into the attack. Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali and former Puntland President Abdirahman Farole likewise sent their condolences to Ambassador Ismail's family, and wished the injured parties a rapid recovery. Farole also accused the central government forces of having neglected to effectively protect federal officials. Additionally, UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay and AMISOM condemned the attack, and extended their condolences to the families of the victims. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf in turn applauded the Somali security forces for their rapid counter-terrorist maneuvers, and reaffirmed her administration's support for the Federal Government of Somalia's development initiatives. The United Nations Human Rights Council also observed a minute of silence in honour of Ismail, with President of the Council Ambassador Joachim Rücker describing the late diplomat as a widely admired and respected leadership figure.  Relaunch  On 8 May 2015, the Makka al-Mukarama hotel officially reopened for business after having undergone refurbishments.

It is located roughly in the center of the harbor east of Colonia, the Yapese capital, between Pekel and Bi Islands. It is a low island with a maximum height of about , and is overgrown with tropical vegetation. The island has local historical importance as the home of Captain David O'Keefe, an enterprising American who arrived on Yap in the 1870s, and was responsible for not only significant economic growth, but also for the depreciation of the distinctive Yapese currency, the large rai stones which became devalued after O'Keefe introduced iron tools that made manufacture of the stones easier. O'Keefe settled on Tarang, where he had a boat landing, coal warehouse, and house. Of these structures, only the boat landing has survived; only foundations survive of the others.

Bowden was born in Rochdale and was educated at Heywood Grammar School and the Royal Manchester College of Music.”Life of a low lady : memoirs of a contralto” Bowden,P.E: Salhouse, Norfolk, W. Elkin, 2002 During World War Two she was a Wren. In 1954 she won the Geneva International Music Competition. News in Brief The Times (London, England), Friday, Oct 01, 1954; p. 7; Issue 53051 She made over 750 professional performances, retiring in 1979. After this she taught at the London College of Music and was President of the Incorporated Society of Musicians. She was also an eloquent advocate of the music of her contemporaries, singing and recording to advantage Tippett's A Child Of Our Time, Britten's ingenuous A Charm Of Lullabies, Lennox Berkeley's tender Four Poems Of St Teresa Of Avila, and the role of Isabella in Bernard Hermann's opera Wuthering Heights. Malcolm Arnold wrote his Five William Blake Songs with Bowden in mind. Between 1954 and 1979, when she retired, she gave more than 750 performances and/or broadcasts under the most distinguished conductors of the day, among them Josef Krips, Paul Sacher, Solti, Sargent, Boult, Mackerras and Boulez. The consistency of her contributions derived from her innate musicianship and innate sense of the appropriate style. Bowden's operatic appearances were limited to some with the English Opera Group and the role of Madame Larina in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, at both Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. Her interpretation of that part, sympathetic and well-pointed as regards the text - she sang it in both Russian and English - showed what the stage lost through the infrequency of her excursions into opera. In retirement, she had a fruitful career as a singing teacher, an administrator and adjudicator. As I recall from working with her on juries, her judgment was always judicious and assured. While searching for the best in any participant's performance, she was also acute in her ability to put her finger on faults. She was also president of the Incorporated Society of Musicians. She married the racing driver Derrick Edwards in 1960. He died in 2000: they had two children.
