He was also a Member of Parliament during the Interregnum. Life The second son of Roger Wingate of Sharpenhoe in Bedfordshire and of his wife Jane, daughter of Henry Birch, he was born at Flamborough in Yorkshire in 1596 and baptised there on 11 June. He matriculated from The Queen's College, Oxford, on 12 October 1610, graduated B.A. on 30 June 1614, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 24 May. Before 1624 he went to Paris, where he became teacher of the English language to the Princess Henrietta Maria. He had learned in England the \\"rule of proportion\\" (logarithmic scale) recently invented by Edmund Gunter which he communicated to mathematicians in Paris. He rushed into print to obtain priority, an advocate in Dijon to whom he had shown the rule in a friendly manner having already begun to make some public use of it. He was in England on the breaking out of the First English Civil War, sided with the parliament, took the solemn League and Covenant, and was made justice of the peace for Bedfordshire. He was then residing at Woodend in the parish of Harlington. In 1650 he took the engagement, became intimate with Oliver Cromwell, and one of the commissioners for the ejection of ignorant and scandalous ministers. He represented Bedfordshire in the parliament of 1654–5. He died in Gray's Inn Lane, and was buried in St. Andrew's, Holborn, on 13 December 1656. He left no will. Administration was granted to his son, Button Wingate, on 28 January 1657. Works His publications, which were numerous, include: *L'usage de la règle de proportion en arithmétique, Paris, 1624; in English as The Use of the Rule of Proportion, London, 1626, 1628, 1645, 1658, 1683 (rectified by Brown and Atkinson). *Arithmetique Logarithmetique, Paris, 1626.

Part i. had been designed \\"onely as a key to open the secrets of the other, which treats of artificial arithmetique performed by logarithms\\", and had therefore not been made sufficiently complete to stand alone as a textbook of elementary arithmetic. This defect was remedied by John Kersey the elder under the eye of Wingate, and a second edition appeared in 1650 as Arithmetique made easie. Wingate himself re-edited part ii., which was published in 1652 as Arithmetique made easie. The second book. The first book ran through many editions, the expression natural arithmetic being discarded for that of common arithmetic, London, 1658, 1673 (6th ed.); 1678 (7th ed.); 1683 (8th ed. and the last edited by Kersey the elder); 1699 (10th ed. edited by Kersey the younger); 1704 (11th ed. with new supplement by George Shelley); 1708, 1713, 1720, 1753 (edited by James Dodson), and 1760. *Statuta Pacis: or a Perfect Table of all the Statutes (now in force) which any way concern the office of a Justice of the Peace, London, 1641, 1644 (under the initials E.

In this he made corrections from some better manuscript than that used in the 1530 publication, but placed them in an appendix, reprinting the text in its corrupt form. He supplied an entire chapter (lib. iv. chap. 5) which had previously been omitted, placing it also in the appendix. He also edited the works of Samuel Foster, and Anthony Wood assigns to him a work entitled Tactometria ... or the Geometry of Regulars, which might be a republication of John Wyberd's book, which appeared under the same title in 1650. Family Wingate married, on 28 July 1628, at Maulden, Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Richard Button of Canons Manor, Wootton in Bedfordshire, by whom he had five sons and two daughters.

He also won a bronze medal in the same event at the 1930 British Empire Games. MacDonald was born in Hamilton, Ontario.

Prior to his rowing career MacDonald worked for Dominion Power, now Ontario Hydro. At the age of 19 he received a commendation from the Governor General of Canada for rescuing and reviving a young boy who had fallen into the waters of Burlington Bay. There was controversy over the result of the men's eight in the 1936 Olympics. Prior to the race the team was out practising when a spectator boat came too close to the rowing shell, and one of its occupants was hit and injured by an oar. The Canadian team's equipment was confiscated and they were forced to compete using old German equipment, and instructed by German officials not to leave the country until a full inquiry had taken place. The team finished fourth and left Germany immediately with the assistance of Olympic officials, who had concerns about the outcome of the proposed enquiry. MacDonald served in the armed forces during World War II, and spent some time in London where he worked in bomb disposal. After the war he was decorated for his role.

Marvel Comics In 1983-1984 Marvel Comics released an A-Team title which ran for 3 issues. Due to the huge popularity of both comics and The A-Team show at that time, information which lists this as a \\"3-issue mini-series\\" is probably accurate. The Marvel Comics series was sold individually then released in \\"packs\\": one pack contained the first 2 issues, the next all 3 issues. Each pack was a sealed transparent bag featuring Marvel's logo and a picture of Spider-Man. Marvel released the series in a trade paperback called The A-Team Storybook. (). The Marvel US comics were also reprinted by Marvel UK in a variety of formats including hardback annual book and The A-Team Summer Special 1985 and The A-Team Summer Special #2 (1986). The final Marvel UK hardback A-Team annual was released in 1991, several years after the cancellation of The A-Team TV series, showing its continued popularity in the UK despite this. IDW Publishing=The A-Team: War Stories In 2010, a miniseries titled The A-Team: War Stories was released to promote the film. The miniseries consisted of four one-shot comics based on each team member before they joined the A-Team. Although Chuck Dixon and Erik Burnham are credited as co-writers for each installment, Dixon stated that they split the work, with Dixon writing the installments for John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith and Templeton Peck, and Burnham writing the installments for B. A. Baracus and Howling Mad Murdock. The series contains art from Hugo Petrus and Casey Maloney, among others. Although the story has been updated to the Gulf War like in the film adaption, and the characters take the appearance of the film's cast, Dixon stated that the miniseries is based on the original TV series. War Stories: Hannibal *War Stories: Hannibal was primarily written by Dixon. Hannibal, deep into trouble extracting a chemical weapon engineer from Saddam Hussein's army with a poor disguise and only a glimmer of a plan, must think (and shoot) his way out of it. Dixon stated, \\"He takes some crazy risks in inserting himself into Iraq early in January [19]91 to kidnap a scientist who's aiding Saddam. Everything goes wrong, and Hannibal has to keep changing his plans on the fly.\\" *War Stories: Face was released in April 2010, primarily written by Dixon. Face \\"races to locate an expensive motorcycle in the middle of a warzone.\\" Dixon stated, \\"In the Face story, we have Templeton Peck making one deal too many in his capacity as a scrounger. His error compounds himself through a series of disasters until he finds himself on the infamous Highway of Death, saving the life of a beautiful woman he just happened to run across. Classic A-Team stuff.\\" Face was illustrated by Alberto Muriel and colored by Gerry Kissell. *War Stories: B.A. was released in March 2010, primarily written by Burnham. \\"B.A.'s story, quite naturally, deals quite a bit with his...aversion to flying.\\" It features B.A. \\"driving, smashing and otherwise bulldozing his way through a dilemma that ultimately leads to his dishonorable discharge.\\" *War Stories: Murdock was released in April 2010, primarily written by Burnham. \\"Murdock's story is a tale told by him through his own skewed perspective on reality.\\" \\"Both [B.A.'s and Murdock's installments] are very funny, with Murdock's story being packed with laugh-out-loud lines. Erik killed on both of them.\\" The A-Team: Shotgun Wedding Shotgun Wedding is another miniseries that brings the whole team together. It was written by the film's director Joe Carnahan and Tom Waltz, and illustrated by Stephen Mooney. Taking place after the events of The A-Team, after their escape, Shotgun Wedding unfolds on a cruise ship. The A-Team is tasked with protecting the daughter of Hannibal's old comrade, after her life is threatened and her upcoming wedding is endangered. Posing as members of the ship's crew and the wedding team, Hannibal becomes the priest, Murdock the chef, B.A. the chauffeur and bodyguard, and Face becomes the couple's wedding planner. There are complications as Murdock's culinary abilities are questionable and Face is already all-too familiar with the bride.

Early life and education Burton was born in Hornsey, London, England, on 28 March 1898. He attended Holloway School. Burton studied zoology at King's College, London under Arthur Dendy. Career Burton became a schoolteacher. He later joined the staff of the Natural History Museum, London in 1926 where he remained for the rest of his career until his retirement in 1958. He was Curator of Sponges at the museum from 1927 to 1948, then its Deputy Keeper of Zoology from 1949 to 1958. His popular science writing included major work on encyclopedias and acting as Science Editor for the Illustrated London News and Nature Correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. In 1961, he published the book The Elusive Monster which reviews the evidence for the Loch Ness Monster in the light of his professional knowledge. He concluded that it was unlikely that such creatures were living in Loch Ness. He commented further on this topic in the New Scientist. Many of Burton's books were aimed at a juvenile audience. Some of his later books or revised editions were published with his son, Robert Burton (born 1941) also trained as a zoologist and who published many natural history books himself. Robert also took over his father's Nature Notes column in the Daily Telegraph. His daughter Jane Burton illustrated many of the books.

The legal and social status of Italian women has undergone rapid transformations and changes during the past decades. This includes family laws, the enactment of anti-discrimination measures, and reforms to the penal code (in particular with regard to crimes of violence against women). History For the Roman period, see Women in Ancient Rome. Women in Pre-modern Italy During the Middle ages, Italian women were considered to have very few social powers and resources, although some widows inherited ruling positions from their husbands (such in the case of Matilde of Canossa). Educated women could find opportunities of leadership only in religious convents (such as Clare of Assisi and Catherine of Siena). The Renaissance (15th–16th centuries) challenged conventional customs from the Medieval period. Women were still confined to the roles of \\"monaca, moglie, serva, cortigiana\\" (\\"nun, wife, servant, courtesan\\").Sara F. Matthews-Grieco (a cura di), Monaca, moglie, serva, cortigiana: vita e immagine delle donne tra Rinascimento e Controriforma (Firenze: Morgana, 2001). However, literacy spread among upper- class women in Italy and a growing number of them stepped out into the secular intellectual circles. Venetian-born Christine de Pizan wrote The City of Ladies in 1404, and in it she described women's gender as having no innate inferiority to men's, although being born to serve the other sex. Some women were able to gain an education on their own, or received tutoring from their father or husband. Lucrezia Tornabuoni in Florence; Veronica Gambara at Correggio; Veronica Franco and Moderata Fonte in Venice; and Vittoria Colonna in Rome were among the renowned women intellectuals of the time. Powerful women rulers of the Italian Renaissance, such as Isabella d'Este, Catherine de' Medici, or Lucrezia Borgia, combined political skill with cultural interests and patronage. Unlike her peers, Isabella di Morra (an important poet of the time) was kept a virtual prisoner in her own castle and her tragic life makes her a symbol of female oppression.Gaetana Marrone, Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A-J, Taylor & Francis, 2007, p. 1242 By the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Italian women intellectuals were embraced by contemporary culture as learned daughters, wives, mothers, and equal partners in their household.Ross, Sarah Gwyneth (2010). The Birth of Feminism: woman as intellect in Renaissance Italy and England. Harvard University Press. p. 2. Among them were composers Francesca Caccini and Leonora Baroni, and painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Outside the family setting, Italian women continued to find opportunities in the convent, and now increasingly also as singers in the theatre (Anna Renzi—described as the first diva in the history of opera—and Barbara Strozzi are two examples). In 1678, Elena Cornaro Piscopia was the first woman in Italy to receive an academical degree, in philosophy, from the University of Padua. Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Italian mathematician and linguist who was, according to Dirk Jan Struik, \\"the first important woman mathematician since Hypatia [fifth century A.D.]\\". Maria Montessori, physician and educator Grazia Deledda, 1926 Nobel Prize winner for Literature Rita Levi- Montalcini, 1986 Nobel Prize winner for Medicine In the 18th-century, the Enlightenment offered for the first time to Italian women (such as Laura Bassi, Cristina Roccati, Anna Morandi Manzolini, and Maria Gaetana Agnesi) the possibility to engage in the fields of science and mathematics. Italian sopranos and prime donne continued to be famous all around Europe, such as Vittoria Tesi, Caterina Gabrielli, Lucrezia Aguiari, and Faustina Bordoni. Other notable women of the period include painter Rosalba Carriera and composer Maria Margherita Grimani. Women of the Risorgimento The Napoleonic Age and the Italian Risorgimento offered for the first time to Italian women the opportunity to be politically engaged.Antonietta Drago, Donne e amori del Risorgimento (Milano, Palazzi, 1960). In 1799 in Naples, poet Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel was executed as one of the protagonists of the short-lived Parthenopean Republic. In the early 19th century, some of the most influential salons where Italian patriots, revolutionaries, and intellectuals were meeting were run by women, such as Bianca Milesi Mojon, Clara Maffei, Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso, and Antonietta De Pace. Some women even distinguished themselves in the battlefield, such as Anita Garibaldi (the wife of Giuseppe Garibaldi), Rosalia Montmasson (the only woman to have joined the Expedition of the Thousand), Giuseppina Vadalà, who along with her sister Paolina led an anti-Bourbon revolt in Messina in 1848, and Giuseppa Bolognara Calcagno, who fought as a soldier in Garibaldi's liberation of Sicily. The Kingdom of Italy (1861–1925) Between 1861 and 1925, women were not permitted to vote in the new Italian state. In 1864, Anna Maria Mozzoni triggered a widespread women's movement in Italy, through the publication of Woman and her social relationships on the occasion of the revision of the Italian Civil Code (La donna e i suoi rapporti sociali in occasione della revisione del codice italiano). In 1868, Alaide Gualberta Beccari began publishing the journal \\"Women\\" in Padua. A growing percentage of young women were now employed in factories, but were excluded from political life and were particularly exploited. Under the influence of socialist leaders, such as Anna Kuliscioff, women became active in the constitution of the first Labour Unions. In 1902, the first law to protect the labour of women (and children) was approved; it forbade them working in mines and limited women to twelve hours of work per day. By the 1880s, women were making inroads into higher education. In 1877, Ernestina Puritz Manasse-Paper was the first woman to receive a university degree in modern Italy, in medicine, and in 1907 Rina Monti became the first female department chair and full professor in an Italian University. The most famous women of the time were actresses Eleonora Duse, Lyda Borelli, and Francesca Bertini; writers Matilde Serao, Sibilla Aleramo, Carolina Invernizio, and Grazia Deledda (who won the 1926 Nobel Prize in Literature); sopranos Luisa Tetrazzini and Lina Cavalieri; and educator Maria Montessori. Maria Montessori was the most amazing woman at this time as she was the first Italian physician, and began Montessori education which is still used today. She was part of Italy's change to further give women rights, and she was an influence to educators in Italy and around the globe. Under the Fascist regime (1925–1945) Even before the March on Rome, despite the difficulties of the revolutionary period (Biennio Rosso), there were still a hundred militant fascist women, while in Monza the first women's fascist group was founded on 12 May 1920. The first point of the fascist Manifesto of Piazza Sansepolcro asked \\"vote and eligibility for women\\", the law of 22 November 1925 established in fact the female vote in local elections. In 1938, moreover, Mussolini even tried to ensure the representation of women in the Chamber of Fasci and Corporations, but the king Vittorio Emanuele III opposed the idea. Which makes understand by which environments arrived the greatest resistances to overcoming the old social and cultural patterns. The truth is that fascism intended to offer women \\"a third way between the oratory and the house\\" . \\"The nationalization of all the individual destinies called each person, man or woman, to participate actively in the construction of the greatness of their country, \\"as Annalisa Terranova wrote in his \\"Camiciette Nere\\". Notable for that time were the rules that established the ban of the dismissal in case of pregnancy and a waiting period for maternity. More than only this laws: challenging the prevailing moralism, fascism will bring to stadiums thousands of young girls, in an attempt of collective mobilization that basically created something from nothing — women's sports — entirely absent in Italy before 1922. In 1935, G.A. Chiurco is even more explicit: \\"The fascist state can't conceive the woman locked in her house.\\" Not always, unfortunately, this awareness came to dismantle the old pre — fascist prejudices, even though it is thanks to the regime's effort if in the Olympics of 1936 Italy conquered a historic gold medal in the 80 meters hurdles with the athlete Ondina Valla, who celebrated with a fascist salute from the top step of the podium. Valla was then received with full honors in Venice Square by Mussolini. The young Italian women of the regime \\"were no longer attached to the skirt of their mothers and had managed to stop with the imprisonment of older sisters, which, at their age, came out of the house only in mom's or aunt's company,\\" acknowledged the anti-fascist Victoria de Grazia. And last but not least is remarkable experience of the SAF (Servizio Ausiliario Femminile): the first female army in the world wanted by Mussolini during the period of the Italian Social Republic (1943-1945).

After WW2, women were given the right to vote in national elections and to be elected to government positions. The new Italian Constitution of 1948 affirmed that women had equal rights. It was not however until the 1970s that women in Italy scored some major achievements with the introduction of laws regulating divorce (1970), abortion (1978), and the approval in 1975 of the new family code. Famous women of the period include politicians Nilde Iotti, Tina Anselmi, and Emma Bonino; actresses Anna Magnani, Sofia Loren, and Gina Lollobrigida; soprano Renata Tebaldi; ballet dancer Carla Fracci; costume designer Milena Canonero; sportwomen Sara Simeoni, Deborah Compagnoni, Valentina Vezzali, and Federica Pellegrini; writers Natalia Ginzburg, Elsa Morante, Alda Merini, and Oriana Fallaci; architect Gae Aulenti; scientist and 1986 Nobel Prize winner Rita Levi- Montalcini; astrophysicist Margherita Hack; astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti; pharmacologist Elena Cattaneo; and CERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti. Issues in present time Today, women have the same legal rights as men in Italy, and have mainly the same job, business, and education opportunities. Reproductive rights and health The maternal mortality rate in Italy is 4 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010), one of the lowest in the world. The HIV/AIDS rate is 0.3% of adults (aged 15–49)—estimates of 2009. Abortion laws were liberalized in 1978: abortion is usually legal during the first trimester of pregnancy, while at later stages of pregnancy it is permitted only for medical reasons, such as problems with the health of the mother or fetal defects.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/italy.doc . However, in practice it is often difficult to obtain an abortion, due to the rising number of doctors and nurses who refuse to perform an abortion based on moral/religious opposition, which they are legally allowed to do. Marriage and family Divorce in Italy was legalized in 1970. Obtaining a divorce in Italy is still a lengthy and complicated process, requiring a period of legal separation before it can be granted, although the period of separation has been reduced in 2015. Adultery was decriminalized in 1969, after the Constitutional Court of Italy struck down the law as unconstitutional, because it discriminated against women. In 1975, Law No. 151/1975 provided for gender equality within marriage, abolishing the legal dominance of the husband. Unmarried cohabitation in Italy and births outside of marriage are not as common as in many other Western countries, but in recent years they have increased. In 2017, 30.9% of all births were outside of marriage, but there are significant differences by regions, with unmarried births being more common in the North than in the South. Italy has a low total fertility rate, with 1.32 children born/woman (in 2017), which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. Of women born in 1968, 20% stayed childless. In the EU, only Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Poland, and Portugal have a lower total fertility rate than Italy. Female education School girls, 1949/1950 Women in Italy tend to have highly favorable results, and mainly excel in secondary and tertiary education. Ever since the Italian economic miracle, the literacy rate of women as well as university enrolment has gone up dramatically in Italy. The literacy rate of women is only slightly lower than that of men (as of 2011, the literacy rate was 98.7% female and 99.2% male). Sixty percent of Italian university graduates are female, and women are excellently represented in all academic subjects, including mathematics, information technology, and other technological areas which are usually occupied by males. Work Male and Female cops in Itay Female standards at work are generally of a high quality and professional, but are not as good as in education. The probability of a woman getting employed is mainly related to her qualifications, and 80% of women who graduate from university go on to seek jobs. Women in Italy face a number of challenges. Although gender roles are not as strict as they have been in the past, sexual and domestic abuse is still quite prevalent in Italy. On average, women do 3.7 hours more housework than men. Men make up the majority of the parliament (women represent less than a third of the parliament). Additionally, women in Italy are not adequately represented in the workforce, as Italy has one of the lowest rates of employment for women of the countries within the European Union. Women's employment rate (for ages 15–64) is 47.8% (in 2015), compared to 66.5% for men. Many women are still frequently expected to stay at home and care for the house and children, as opposed to earning a salary and becoming a breadwinner, and few senior managerial positions are held by women. Furthermore, there are unequal standards and expectations for the few women who actually make it into a professional setting. For example, 9% of working Italian mothers have lost their jobs due to pregnancy. Although legislation protects pregnant women (in accordance with EU directives), the social climate still does not reflect full equality, nor does it protect against abuse. An infamous practice in Italy is that of \\"white resignation\\" (dimissione in bianco), whereby female employees are asked as condition for their employment or promotion to sign undated resignation papers, which are kept by the employer who adds a date on them when the woman is pregnant so that she \\"resigns\\" at that date. Social views, particularly in Southern Italy, remain quite conservative. Italian lawmakers are working to further protect and support women as they break gender stereotypes and join the workforce, but complete cultural change is slow. Nevertheless, the proportion of women in the workforce has increased in recent years: according to World Bank, in 1990 women made up 36.3% of the labour force, while by 2016 they made up 42.1%. Pay Women holding white collar, high level, or office jobs tend to get paid the same as men, but women with blue collar or manual positions are paid 1/3 less than their male counterparts. Culture and society Today, there is a growing acceptance of gender equality, and people (especially in the North) tend to be far more liberal towards women getting jobs, going to university, and doing stereotypically male things. However, in some parts of society, women are still stereotyped as being simply housewives and mothers, also reflected in the fact of a higher-than-EU average female unemployment. Ideas about the appropriate social behaviour of women have traditionally had a very strong impact on the state institutions, and it has long been held that a woman's 'honour' is more important then her well-being. Until the 1970s, rape victims were often expected and forced to marry their rapist. In 1965, Franca Viola, a 17-year-old girl from Sicily, created a sensation when she refused to marry the man who kidnapped and raped her. In refusing this \\"rehabilitating marriage\\" to the perpetrator, she went against the traditional social norms of the time which dictated such a solution. Until 1981, the Criminal Code itself supported this practice, by exonerating the rapist who married his victim. The Franca Viola incident was made into a movie called La moglie più bella. In 2000 female toplessness was officially legalized (in a nonsexual context) in all public beaches and swimming pools throughout Italy (unless otherwise specified by region, province or municipality by-laws) in 20 March 2000, when the Supreme Court of Cassation (through sentence No. 3557) determined that the exposure of the nude female breast, after several decades, was considered a \\"commonly accepted behavior\\", and therefore, \\"entered into the social costume\\". In more recent times the media, particularly TV shows, have been accused of promoting sexist stereotypes. In 2017, one talk-show of a state- owned broadcaster was cancelled after accusations that it promoted discriminatory views of women. Violence against women In 2020, statistics showed that 8 out of 10 female victims murders were murdered by a current or previous partner. A third of women were exposed to violence. From 2000 to 2012, 2200 women were killed and 75% of those were murdered by a former or current partner. This represented about one murder every two days. A 2012 United Nations report noted that 90% of women who were raped or abused in Italy did not report the crime to police. In recent years, Italy has taken steps to address violence against women and domestic violence, including creating Law No. 38 of 23 April 2009. Italy has also ratified the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. Until the 1970s, in some regions rape victims were often expected and forced to marry their rapist. In 1965, Franca Viola, a 17-year-old girl from Sicily, created a sensation when she refused to marry the man who kidnapped and raped her. In refusing this \\"rehabilitating marriage\\" to the perpetrator, she went against the traditional social norms of the time which dictated such a solution. In 1976 in the Supreme Court of Italy ruled that \\"the spouse who compels the other spouse to carnal knowledge by violence or threats commits the crime of carnal violence\\" [meaning rape] (\\"commette il delitto di violenza carnale il coniuge che costringa con violenza o minaccia l’altro coniuge a congiunzione carnale\\"). As well, in 1981, Italy repealed Article 544.Van Cleave, Rachel A. “Rape and the Querela in Italy: False Protection of Victim Agency.” Michigan Journal of Gender & Law, vol. 13, 2007, pp. 273–310. Traditionally, as in other Mediterranean-European areas, the concept of family honour was very important in Italy. Indeed, until 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances for so-called honour killings.Until 1981 the law read: Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister. Traditionally, honour crimes used to be more prevalent in Southern Italy.

He was born in 1720, the eldest son of Thomas Montgomery, M.P. for Lifford, and his wife Mary Franklin. His youngest brother was the famous American Revolution war-hero, Major-General Richard Montgomery. He was elected Member of Parliament as an Independent for County Donegal in the General Election of 1768 and represented that constituency until August 1800. He was also High Sheriff of Donegal in 1773. He had two nicknames. He was first called \\"Black Montgomery\\" because of a scalping incident in the Seven Years' War in Canada and later in life he was called \\"Old Sandy\\" to distinguish him from his cousin Alexander Montgomery (died 1785) (Young Sandy) who was a year younger and who represented County Monaghan in the Irish Parliament at the same time as Old Sandy. He was a captain in the British Army's 43rd Regiment of Foot, which served in America. His regiment was part of General James Wolfe's attack on French Quebec in 1759. Lieutenant Malcolm Fraser of the 48th Regiment of Foot asserted that on 23 August 1759, his detachment was brought under the command of Alexander Montgomery for an attack on a village near Saint-Joachim. Fraser states in his journal: Montgomery resigned from the British Army in 1763 because a junior officer was promoted over him. He was also a Colonel in the Raphoe Battalion of the Volunteers and was their delegate at the Dungannon Convention. Montgomery won his last election in 1797 by releasing Republican freeholders from Lifford Gaol to vote for him. He joined the Royal Dublin Society in 1773. Montgomery was noted for his duelling. Among his opponents was Francis Mansfield, the High Sheriff of Donegal in 1788. On one occasion while duelling in the bishop's garden in Derry, his opponent's first pistol-round shot off the tails of Montgomery's swallow-tailed coat. Undeterred, Montgomery finished the duel sitting in a chair in order to conceal his bare posterior. In 1797 he won a duel with a Donegal loyalist and was carried home in triumph to Convoy by the United Irishmen. Montgomery was suspect in government circles. In 1773 he was described as \\"extremely popular and very flighty\\". \\"The Irish Parliament 1775\\" states- \\"Lord Townshend attempted, and Lord Harcourt obtained for him in Council a Port of Discharge at Letterkenny. He came into Parliament upon Popular Ground in the County. He stands by & court the Government his Support but even after all that has been done his support is very doubtfull. However during the last Session he was pretty steady. Mr. Montgomery has got to his Recommendation Two Boatmen, a Tidewaiter Surveyor of the Lough Swilley Barge and a Hearth Money Collection\\". Sketches of the Members of the Irish Parliament in 1782 stated- \\"Alexander Montgomery Esq., member for Donegall County has a good estate in this county-brother to the rebel Montgomery who was killed at Quebec-concerned much in the North-West Fisheries-an impracticable and dangerous man-an advocate for Mr. Flood's doctrine of Renunciation. It is supposed he will leave his fortune to one of Lord Ranelagh's children, to whom his sister is married. Lord Carlisle obliged him by allowing him to name some officers in the Port of Ballyraine, for which favour he often supported\\". He was vehemently opposed to the 1800 Act of Union between the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain and voted against it. He died unmarried on 29 September 1800, at the age of 80, before the Acts of Union became law and on his tombstone in the churchyard of Raphoe Cathedral is inscribed: \\"Sacred to the memory of Alex Montgomery of Convoy who represented this once Independent county in Parliament for 32 years.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Alexander Montgomery's tombstone Category:1720 births Category:1800 deaths Category:Irish MPs 1769–1776 Category:Irish MPs 1776–1783 Category:Irish MPs 1783–1790 Category:Irish MPs 1790–1797 Category:Irish MPs 1798–1800 Category:43rd Regiment of Foot officers Category:People from Lifford Category:High Sheriffs of Donegal Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Donegal constituencies Category:Montgomery family ","title":"Alexander Montgomery (1720–1800)"},{"id":"25794564","title":"List of nature reserves in Lower Saxony"},{"id":"25794565","text":"Jean-Baptiste Stahl (German: Johann Baptist Stahl) (20 June 1869 – 31 January 1932) was the inventor and designer of the Phanolith. He was born in Oberbetschdorf, Alsace, in 1869, as the son of Louis Stahl (born 1843) and Anna Maria Braun (born 1841) He grew up in the traditional pottery of his family. His studies of ceramics, modelling and sculpture led him to Strasbourg and Höhr-Grenzhausen. His detailed, translucent and finely worked porcelain reliefs gained him a gold medal at the 1900 Paris World's Fair. Partly influenced by Art Nouveau, Jean-Baptiste Stahl took topics from Greek mythology and rural life. Usually, the white translucent figures are finely set on a blue or green background that partly shines through. Striking is his absolute eye for the detailed modelling of his figures in a very delicate and lively way. In order to increase the three-dimensional illusion, he carefully modulated the transparency of the white porcelain. On the one hand, parts of the scene and figures with higher translucency, i.e. darker tint, were precisely placed to evoke the impression of shadow. On the other hand, he used this means in a way to let parts in the background systematically fade out the farer away they should appear. The most prominent figures in a scene show the highest fraction of pure white. In this way Jean-Baptiste Stahl achieves mastery of the so-called pate sur pate style in that his rather flat reliefs of his mature period demonstrate the three-dimensional illusion most prominently. Jean-Baptiste Stahl explored the variation of the translucency of the white porcelain as painters do, who simulate changing lights, shadows, depth and plasticity by varying the brightness of the colours. He signed his work either with JStahl or JS. In preparation of his porcelain reliefs he made precise pencil drawings that are partially colorized. A fraction of these were rescued post war, from the debris of the Villeroy & Boch factory building, by his grandson Erich Stahl, who was one year old when Jean-Baptiste Stahl died. All of Jean-Baptiste Stahl’s work was solely from his lifetime employment at Villeroy & Boch in Mettlach, Saarland, Germany, where he headed the factory's school of drawing. Besides himself, his son Hans Stahl (22 November 1898 - 13 January 1978) was employed as a modeller till retirement in 1963. As an apprentice, his grandson Erich Stahl (born 24 March 1931) learned the old tradition of copper engraving as a pre-stage for the transfer of a certain kind of decors. Out of this craftsmanship he developed his own techniques in a period of over 65 years in the course of his unique work of art. Examples of his work can be found at the Albrecht-Dürer-Foundation in Nürnberg. With Branko Stahl (born 10 June 1963) the art tradition lives on in the Stahl family in the fourth generation.

Feats of strength Travis was born in Brooklyn as Roland Morgan on February 21, 1876.Willoughby, David P. (1970). The Super- Athletes. A. S. Barnes. p. 82 He was an adopted child and turned professional weightlifter at age 21. He weighed only around 200 pounds (90 kg)at his prime. In 1906, he was awarded the \\"World's Greatest Weightlifter\\" by a popular strength publication and received a jewel-studded belt. His favourite lifts were the Heavy Lifts, such as the Harness Lift and the Back Lift, and Finger Lifts. In front of witnesses, he lifted 3,985 pounds (1807 kg)in the Harness Lift and 4,140 pounds (1880 kg)in the Back Lift. In 1907, he lifted 667 pounds (303 kg) with one finger. Travis was a successful as a businessman and became very wealthy. For 55 years, he held the record for total poundage lifted, that is, lifts done for repetitions, where the lifter may choose any lift and rep/set scheme, to lift the most weight within a given time frame. The standard for this record was initially set by Travis in 1927, when he Back Lifted 5.5 million pounds (2.5 million kg) in 3 hours, 9 minutes. He did this was done by doing 5500 reps with 1000 pounds (450 kg). His record was broken in 1982 by Howard Prechtel, who Back Lifted 6,066,060 pounds (2,751,518 kg) in 3 hours, 9 minutes. Loss of unofficial strongman title Travis was defeated by John B. Gagnon for the unofficial title of \\"The World’s Strongest Man\\" in 1923. On Feb. 13, 1923, Gagnon competed against Travis in a test of strength. Travis, confident he could prevail over the Gagnon accepted the challenge and, in fact, before the contest, posted a $5,000 challenge \\"for anyone who will follow me in my stunts.\\" The contest took place at the city hall in Augusta, Maine. Gagnon opened the show by bending a sixty-penny spike double with his hands. Next, he placed a 5/8-inch iron bar between his teeth and bent it in an arc. Then Gagnon held two horseshoes upright in one hand, forming a “W”, and then asked for eight strong members of the audience to try to pull the steel shoes apart, but they could not. Whenever Travis demonstrated a lift, Gagnon countered with a heavier one. Gagnon won the match when he lifted 23 men on a platform, for a total lift of 4,040 pounds (1833 kg). Travis withdrew from any further lifts and was defeated. Travis challenged Gagnon to a return match in New York. The prize was to be Travis's diamond belt and title of \\"World’s Strongest Man.\\" Gagnon’s manager tried several times to schedule the rematch, but one never occurred. Travis continued to lift heavy weights until his death on July 12, 1941, at the age of 65. He died during one of his performances of a heart attack at Luna Park on Coney Island. \\"Challenge to the World\\" Travis left a \\"Challenge to the World\\" in his will. It was an open challenge to anyone who could duplicate or exceed his lifting accomplishments. The first person to do this would receive his prized jewel-studded belt. Listed below is the challenge Travis claimed he could do. * Take a 100-pound (45 kg )barbell from the floor with both hands, and press it overhead 10 times while seated (must be done in 30 seconds) * Take a pair of 90-pound (41 kg) dumbbells from the side of the body to the shoulders, and press it to arms length overhead. * Teeth lift from the floor, hands behind neck, 350 pounds. * Finger Lift from the floor 350 pounds (159 kg) with one finger, eight times in five seconds. * Finger lift from the floor 560 pounds (254 kg)with one finger once. * Two hand grip lift, straddling the weight, 700 pounds (318 kg)twenty times in ten seconds. * Hand and Thigh Lift 1600 pounds (725 kg) once. * Back Lift 3660 pounds (1660 kg) once. * Harness Lift 3580 pounds (1625 kg) once. * Back Lift 2000 pounds (900 kg), 250 times in seven minutes. Travis’ rules stated that these lifts must all be done in 30 minutes and must be done for 10 straight years. No one has yet succeeded in the challenge.

He was born in Colne, Lancashire. During his career, he played for Somerset County Cricket Club, and made a total of 48 first-class appearances for the county. Cricket career Hall was a right-arm fast or fast-medium bowler and a right-handed tail-end batsman. Some measure of the relative merits of his batting and bowling is that he took more first-class wickets than he scored first-class runs. Unusually for a fast bowler, he wore spectacles. He played Lancashire League cricket for Colne Cricket Club from the age of 15. In 1959 and 1960 he appeared in second eleven matches for Lancashire in both the Second Eleven Championship and the Minor Counties Championship. Unable to break into the Lancashire first team, Hall joined Somerset in 1961 and made his debut in the match against Cambridge University in June; the 6 not out he made in a last-wicket stand with Mike Latham to win the match would prove to be his fourth highest innings in a career where he batted 51 times. He also played in three County Championship matches that 1961 season without success. In the 1962 season, Hall played in more than half of Somerset's matches, usually opening the bowling. He took 46 wickets at an average of 34.04 in the season. His best bowling performance of the season was to take the first four Hampshire wickets in the second innings of the match at Southampton. The match immediately before that one, he had produced the best batting performance of his career: a not out 12 against Yorkshire in a high-scoring draw at Taunton. For the 1963 season, Somerset recruited the Worcestershire fast bowler Fred Rumsey as a new-ball partner for Ken Palmer; Rumsey was an instant success, and became a Test player from 1964, so Hall's opportunities in the first team in both 1963 and 1964 were much reduced. Injury to Palmer in 1965 and Rumsey's Test calls led to more matches for Hall in 1965, and with 41 wickets at an average of 24.48 he had his best season in first-class cricket. Against Cambridge University in June, he took five wickets for 33 runs, the best performance of his career to that point. And he then bettered that with six for 60 in Nottinghamshire's first innings in the match at Worksop, a game in which he also had to hold out at the end as a batsman to save the match, which he did by courtesy of being dropped at backward short leg in the last-but-one over of the game. Hall played only three limited overs matches, but was prominent in two of them. His first match, against Nottinghamshire in the Gillette Cup in 1964, was the first to be decided on the basis of the winning side having lost fewer wickets. Wisden reported Somerset's victory: \\"They needed four to win with the last pair together when (Bryan) Wells began the final over; (Brian) Langford took a single, Hall was nearly run out then scored a run, and Langford managed to scramble another off the last ball to equal the scores.\\" In the next round, against Sussex, Hall took five wickets for 34 runs in his 13 overs and won the Man of the Match Award, the first such award to be won by a Somerset player in the competition; Somerset nonetheless lost the match. Hall left Somerset after the 1965 season. He played Minor Counties cricket for Cumberland in 1966. After cricket After retiring from first-class cricket and having a career designing heating systems for local government, he moved to Braunton, North Devon with his second wife Mary. He died at Braunton on 2 November 2009 after suffering from prostate cancer.

The Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ or EPGZ) is a system of active coaxial left lateral-moving strike slip faults which runs along the southern side of the island of Hispaniola, where Haiti and the Dominican Republic are located. The EPGFZ is named for Lake Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic where the fault zone emerges, and extends across the southern portion of Hispaniola through the Caribbean to the region of the Plantain Garden River in Jamaica.  Geology  The EPGFZ shares approximately half of the relative motion between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates with the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone which runs along the northern side of Hispaniola. Both faults merge into the Cayman Trench to the west. The fault accommodates about 20.6±1.66 millimeters of lateral motion per year (mm/yr). Additionally, a component of compression is present as the North American Plate pushes toward the southwest. This results in vertical deformation manifest in the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola. Some researchers believe that the EPGFZ and the Septentrional-Orient fault zone bound a microplate, dubbed the Gonâve Microplate, a area of the northern Caribbean Plate that is in the process of shearing off the Caribbean Plate and accreting to the North America Plate.  Earthquakes  Fault system in the vicinity of the 12 January 2010 quake, epicenter is the red circle. * A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck southeastern coast of Jamaica in 1692, almost destroying Port Royal * An earthquake struck along the southern coast of Hispaniola in 1751. * A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince in 1770. * The 1907 Kingston earthquake damaged every building in Kingston, Jamaica. * A magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred near Port-au-Prince, Haiti as a result of seismic activity along blind thrust faults associated with this fault zone on January 12, 2010. Other historical large earthquakes in 1860, 1761, 1684, 1673, and 1618 are also likely attributed to the EPGFZ, though none of these have been confirmed in the field as associated with this fault.  Monitoring  A temporary Canadian seismic sensor network of three stations has been established in Haiti along the fault, as of February 19, 2010. The network is not considered permanent, but will remain for quite some time. The stations are in secure locations, being expensive equipment, and are satellite linked to Natural Resources Canada in Ottawa. They are solar powered, so do not require grid connections. One station is at the Canadian Embassy in Port-au-Prince (in the suburb of Pétion- Ville, in the district of Juvénat), and has a permanent guard of one. Another is at the Jacmel Airport, currently run by Canadian Forces personnel. The third is at a Léogâne orphanage, considered secure, but there are problems discouraging children from playing with it. The stations are roughly 50 km apart. These are the first seismic stations ever in the country.Radio Kiskeya, \\"La terre n’a pas fini de trembler en Haïti\\", 22 February 2010 (accessed 23 February 2010) References ;Bibliography * External links * Magnitude 7.0 - Haiti Region, 2010 January 12 21:53:09 UTC – United States Geological Survey Category:2010 Haiti earthquake Category:Seismic faults of North America Category:Geology of Haiti Category:Geology of the Dominican Republic Category:Geology of Jamaica Category:Geology of the Caribbean Category:Geography of the Caribbean Category:Strike-slip faults ","title":"Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone"},{"id":"25794625","text":"Djangology is a compilation album by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli, released in 1961.

The yoga hybrid began in America in 2003, came to Britain a year later, and had spread around the Western world by 2011. Doga teachers have noted the \\"seemingly enlightened\\" nature of dogs and the benefits of exercise, bonding and enjoyment that the activity can bring. The Doga teacher Mahny Djahanguiri has stated that while dogs \\"don't actually do yoga\\", Doga brings laughter and joy, freeing people from feeling they must be perfect to practice. Doga has however been criticised as a fad and for trivialising yoga. History Doga is a hybrid of yoga as exercise with the use of pet dogs. It began in America, a milestone being the 2003 book Doga: Yoga for Dogs by Jennifer Brilliant and William Berloni; they claimed that \\"Dogis [sic] never try to impress. They practice doga with effortlessness and compassion, self-aware but never self- conscious.\\" ABC News reported that the 30-minute classes that \\"allow[ed] you to meditate with dogs\\" were \\"surprisingly orderly\\". Doga was brought to the United Kingdom in 2004 by a pet shop, the Pet Pavilion of London. In this version, the pets are often held by their owners. Doga was popularised in the UK by the Swiss-British yoga teacher Mahny Djahanguiri; her 2015 book Doga: Yoga for you and your dog notes that \\"of course dogs don't actually do yoga\\", and suggests that \\"Doga has very little to do with perfection. It brings laughter and joy to people's hearts\\". The travel writer Elizabeth Gowing tried one of Djahanguiri's classes in Shoreditch, an inner-city district with few dogs; she observed the similarity of the way puppies romped about the class to the wandering of her unruly puppy-mind thoughts when first learning meditation, and noted that city-dwellers without dogs seemed to be longing for dogs to love. The class stepped through the asanas, modified to include dogs: reclining Boat pose, the dogs reclining in their owners' laps; the standing Triangle pose, with dog under an arm \\"like a handbag\\"; and the inverted Downward Dog, one \\"obliging spaniel\\" joining in. Doga arrived in Australia by 2011, where the instructor Hannah Reed stated that \\"the dogs are massaged gently using pressure points\\" and that the practice was safe for dogs with arthritis or hip dysplasia, but she noted that classes could be \\"quite chaotic\\". A 2014 Canadian version of Doga claimed to explore and develop the dogs' social learning through imitation and cognition. Benefits Bethany Lyttle writing in The New York Times, and Katie Briney writing on the Active website, report claimed advantages of Doga, including that the practice emphasizes yoga's focus on union between beings; helps establish a pack mentality; strengthens the bond between owner and pet; can provide additional weight resistance to intensify a physical practice; can assist injured, obese, or elderly dogs; and is enjoyable. Doga teacher Brenda Bryan writes in her 2009 book Barking Buddha that \\"with their innate instincts, joy in simple pleasures, and soulful eyes, dogs also are seemingly enlightened beings—Barking Buddhas, if you will\\", and can \\"teach us about life and love\\". The occupational therapist Melissa Y. Winkle describes in her book Dogwood Doga a wide range of activities shared by owner and dog, selected for their therapeutic value, with precautions to be observed. Issues Doga has been criticised as a fad, for trivialising yoga, for lax policies on teacher certification, and for untrained dogs' interference in participants' concentration and relaxation. The UK charity Dogs Trust has warned that unsupervised Doga may harm the dogs' welfare. Australian dog trainer Martin Dominick stated without adducing evidence that doga could worsen the behaviour of disobedient dogs. A pet insurance CEO, Jack Stephens, stated that yoga's therapeutic effects \\"were never proven on dogs\\". Analysts at the Swedish merchant bank SEB selected \\"dog yoga\\" in 2007 as the most evident sign of \\"overheating\\" – an excessive money supply encouraging people to spend on trivia, possibly predicting a financial crash – in the Swedish economy.

Saltzman was born to a Russian-immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of three sons. After first enrolling in Syracuse University, Saltzman attended University of Cincinnati and studied to become a rabbi. He became ordained in 1956 at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Saltzman was an assistant rabbi at Congregation Emanu-El B'ne Jeshrun in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, rabbi of B'nai Abraham Synagogue in Hagerstown, Maryland, and rabbi at Temple Beth-El in Chappaqua, New York. He then spent eleven years as chief rabbi at Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation. From 1978 to 1996, he was chief rabbi at Baltimore Hebrew Congregation. After retiring to Florida, Saltzman became the part-time rabbi of Bat Yam Temple of the Islands Tzedakah in Sanibel, Florida. A leader in both the Indianapolis and Baltimore communities, Saltzman appeared regularly as a co-host with William Hudnut on the Indianapolis public television program Focus on Faith, expanding religious education though the creation of Baltimore Hebrew Day School, and instituting several social justice programs in both cities. Saltzman participated in many civil rights protests throughout the 1960s, marching with Martin Luther King, Jr. on several occasions. In 1964, he was one of several rabbis arrested during the St. Augustine Movement protests in St. Augustine, Florida. The incident was the largest mass arrest of rabbis in history. In 1975, Saltzman was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1983, Saltzman co-authored an op-ed column with fellow commissioners Mary Frances Berry and Blandina Ramirez in which the three accused President Ronald Reagan of treating the Commission as \\"lap dogs\\" rather than \\"watch dogs.\\" In a controversial move, President Reagan fired all three commissioners. Berry and Ramirez successfully sued to return to the commission on the grounds that it was meant to be a nonpartisan entity. Saltzman chose not to be part of the suit. He died on January 5, 2010 in Fort Myers, Florida, from pancreatic cancer, leaving behind his wife Esther (née Herskowitz), three children, and six grandchildren.

By the time that Sotiri was designing the building, he had vast experience that included that of being the architect of the Court of Queen Elisabeth of Wied of Romania. The building was finished in 1937, a few months before King Zog married Queen Géraldine Apponyi de Nagyappony. The villa was used after World War II as a government reception building.

Dunlop's Maxaret was the first anti-lock braking system (ABS) to be widely used. Introduced in the early 1950s, Maxaret was rapidly taken up in the aviation world, after testing found a 30% reduction in stopping distances, and the elimination of tyre bursts or flat spots due to skids. Experimental fittings on cars and motorcycles demonstrated mixed performance, and ABS systems would not appear on mainstream, non sporting cars until the 1970s when electronic controls matured. Operation The Maxaret system had four main parts, all of which weighed only 4.7 pounds and fit within the small confines of a main landing gear wheel. The system was entirely mechanical, and worked by measuring the relative speed of two spinning disks. The first, the \\"drum\\", was surrounded by a rubber disk and arranged within the aircraft wheel's internal periphery, so that the rubber maintained strong mechanical contact with the wheel. The second, a flywheel, was attached to the drum with a one- way clutch. Normally, with the wheel turning, the wheel would spin the drum, which would spin the flywheel, so that all of the moving parts were spinning at the same speed.Non-Skid, pg. 587 When a skid developed, the wheel would stop, stopping the drum along with it. The flywheel, driven by the one-way clutch, continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This released brake fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and releasing the brakes. As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was released and the brakes re- applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled. Aircraft use Aircraft have a much lower ratio of tyre contact patch to vehicle weight, and operate at much higher speeds. For these reasons, it is much easier to enter a skid in an aircraft through the over-application of brakes, and threshold braking is essentially impossible as the skid develops so rapidly. This makes landings in marginal conditions very difficult, and leads to many common weather conditions precluding flying. Slippery conditions from heavy rain, or even light snow or ice, will close a field. In early testing on the Avro Canada CF-100, the Maxaret allowed landings to be safely made on runways covered in ice.Non-Skid, pg. 588 Since the operational requirements of most aircraft are defined by the best take-off or landing distances under all weather conditions, Maxaret allowed aircraft to operate at 15% higher all-up weights. Another benefit was initially unexpected. Braking effect is greatly reduced at high speeds; the coefficient of friction between a tyre and concrete is about 0.7 to 1.0 at , but decreases dramatically to 0.3 to 0.5 at . This means that it is much easier to skid when first landing, a fact that led pilots to hold off on the brakes until the aircraft was firmly down, and then slowly increase pressure to avoid skids. With Maxaret, they simply applied full braking as soon as they touched down, knowing that the system would prevent skids. As a result, braking distances even in perfect conditions were greatly improved, on the order of 30%. A later modification allowed the brakes to be applied before landing, with the valve only applying the brakes when the wheel spun up at least once. When skidding occurs, the tyres can be rubbed flat, or even burst. Aircraft tyres have much shorter lifetimes than cars for these reasons. Since Maxaret reduced the skidding, spreading it out over the entire surface of the tyre, the tyre lifetime is improved. One early tester summed up the system thus: > The runway was very wet on the first landing, and the aircraft's all up > weight was at least 12 per cent above the maximum landing weight. The brakes > were held on at approximately 1,200 lb/sq in pressure from a speed of 80-85 > knots, until the aircraft came to rest. The braking distance was estimated > at 1,200 yards. The tyres were completely unmarked. Landing previously in an > identical machine without Maxarets, and at approximately the same all up > weight, great difficulty was experienced in stopping the aircraft in an > estimated distance of 1,600 yards, with the braking parachute streamed at > approximately 70 knots. On this occasion two tyres were burst, and the > remaining six were damaged beyond repair. Maxaret, developed by Dunlop in the UK, quickly found uses on most UK military aircraft, such as the Handley Page Victor, BAC TSR.2,http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%201018.html and English Electric Lightning. Civil aircraft included airliners such as the Hawker Siddeley Trident.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200940.html Many companies followed suit, both in military and civilian models. One interesting variation was used on the Fokker F-27 aircraft, which, because it did not have a hydraulic system, used a high-pressure pneumatic system to actuate the brakes, including the Maxaret anti-skid system. Other aircraft fitted with Maxaret were the Avro Vulcan, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Valiant, Folland Gnat, de Havilland Comet 2c, de Havilland Sea Vixen, and later aircraft, such as the Vickers VC10, Hawker Siddeley 125, Hawker Siddeley HS 748 and derived British Aerospace ATP, and BAC One-Eleven. By 1966 a later electronic version of Maxaret had been developed, Maxaret Mark X. Other uses There were numerous applications of the Maxaret to various vehicles, including experimental fits to a Royal Enfield Super Meteor and some production use on semi-trailers. However, its most famous use is on the Jensen FF, the British sportscar that introduced ABS, all-wheel drive and a traction control system.Robson Sports Illustrated called it the \\"safest car in the world\\" in a 1965 article.John Lovesey, \\"Safety With Exhilaration: The New Jensen\\", Sports Illustrated, 8 November 1965 In this case the system had an undesirable side-effect; the relief valve fed directly into the master pump, and caused the brake pedal to drive back towards the driver when it actuated.

The wreck was rediscovered in 1995 by wreck divers John Chatterton and John Yurga. History The Plant Investment Co. originally contracted for the building of the vessel in 1895 with The Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. The original contract was for $500,000, but the vessel ended up being delivered 3 years late and costing $536,000 over budget, and represented the greatest loss (in percentage terms) of any ship built by The Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. After such an inconspicuous start, things scarcely improved for the vessel. She was christened on 30 January 1896 as La Grande Duchesse, and following her sea trials was delivered to The Plant Investment Co in November 1896. She was refused because of boiler and propeller problems, after which she was subjected to a refit, but was refused again in September 1897, and further modifications were made. She successfully completed further sea trials in June 1898. She was finally accepted by The Plant Investment Co. on 9 April 1899 and the US government chartered her for a transport in the Spanish–American War. In November 1901 she was passed to the Ocean Steamship Co. (and renamed City of Savannah), for whom she ran a service between New York City and Charleston, South Carolina. She was then sold to the New York and Porto Rico Steamship Co. in January 1906, and renamed the Carolina. Throughout her working life, she had continual problems with her machinery. She seemed to suffer from vibration problems, and the twin-screw design of the stern causing steering and handling problems. She was further damaged by a fire on 21 November 1907 while in drydock. In 1913, she had a considerable refit which resolved many of her mechanical problems. Ironically, the work was done by her original building yard, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. However, less than two months later she collided with the liner Cleveland in New York harbor. Sinking SS Carolina left San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 29, 1918, with 218 passengers, 117 crew members and a cargo of sugar, bound for New York. At 5:55 pm on Sunday, June 2, she received a radio SOS from the US schooner Isabel B Wiley saying that she was being attacked by a submarine.German Submarine Activities on the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada, Office of Naval Records and Library: Historical Section, Washington Government Printing Office, 1920. (pp.36-38) The Carolina's master, Captain Barber, ordered full speed and steered away from the reported location. Shortly afterwards, a surfaced submarine was sighted, the SM U-151, which fired three warning shells from her deck guns and hoisted the flag signal for \\"abandon ship\\". The captain ordered the ship's life boats to be filled, women and children first and lowered at 6:30. When all the boats were away, the U-151 fired three further shells into the ship's port side and stood to while it listed and finally sank at 7:55. Most of the ship's boats stayed together and survived a squall during the night. They were picked up by the schooner Eva B Douglas at 11am the following day. One life boat made it to the coast at Atlantic City and another was picked by the British steamship Appleby. At 4pm, the Danish steamship Bryssel found the swamped motor dory from the Carolina; the eight male passengers and five crew on the boat had drowned. It was the first loss of life caused by U-Boat activity on the US Atlantic seaboard. Carolina was one of six vessels sunk by the U-151 on June 2, 1918, which caused that day to be known as \\"Black Sunday\\". Rediscovery The wreck was rediscovered by divers John Chatterton and John Yurga. Chatterton lodged a salvage claim in the New Jersey Federal district court, arresting the ship. The salvage case was heard by Federal District Court Judge Joseph Rodriguez, whose father, ironically, had been a passenger on the Carolina. However, Chatterton subsequently wrote an open letter (at the bottom of the linked page, which is a long treatise on the maritime law issues surrounding salvage) to the diving community saying they were free to take items off the ship, he was simply protecting his position from insurance companies. In the event, Chatteron would eventually salvage the purser's safe from the Carolina with renowned wreck diver Gary Gentile, which was found to contain gold coin and jewelry. After relations between the two men broke down, Gentile would later write in his book, Shadow Divers Exposed, that despite the assistance he lent to Chatterton, Chatteron only gave him a token share of the salvage claim.

Moore and Henry Kuttner, published under the joint pseudonym \\"Lawrence O'Donnell\\" in September, 1946. It has been anthologized many times and was selected for The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume 2A. Authorship This story is often said to be Moore's or \\"almost entirely\\" hers, but scholars are not certain of how much Kuttner was involved and at least one gives him some credit. Synopsis The story is set in an unnamed American city at about the time of publication. There are several mentions of how beautiful the weather is. Oliver Wilson is renting an old mansion to three vacationers for the month of May. He wants to get rid of them so he can sell the house to someone who has offered him three times its value, provided the buyer can move in during May. His fiancée, Sue, insists that he arrange for them to leave so that he can sell the house, giving them enough money for their impending marriage. The tenants are a man, Omerie Sancisco, and two women, Klia and Kleph Sancisco. They fascinate Oliver with the perfection of their appearance and manners, their strange connoisseur's attitude to everything, and their secretiveness about their origin and about their insistence on that house at that time. Oliver's half-hearted attempts to evict them founder when he becomes attracted to Kleph. The mystery deepens with remarks she lets slip, with the unspectacular but advanced technology of things she has in her room—including a recorded \\"symphonia\\" that engages all the senses with imagery of historical disasters—and with the appearance of the would-be buyers, a couple from the same country, who plant a \\"subsonic\\" in the house intended to drive the residents out. Hearing Kleph sing \\"Come hider, love, to me\\"Hider is Chaucer's spelling of hither. from the Prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Oliver realizes that she and her friends are time travelers from the future. He traps Kleph into admitting they are visiting the most perfect seasons in history, such as a fall in the late 14th century in Canterbury. Oliver happens to see a healed scar on her arm, which she hastens to cover and admits with obvious shame that it is an inoculation; the reason for her shame will become clear only at the end. At the end of May, more time travelers visit the house. A meteorite lands nearby, destroying buildings and starting fires—the \\"spectacle\\" that the time travelers wanted to end their visit with. Oliver's house survives, as the visitors had already known it would. The time travelers leave for the coronation of Charlemagne in 800, except Cenbe, the genius who composed the symphonia Oliver had experienced. In conversation with Oliver, Cenbe admits that the time travelers could prevent the disasters they savor but do not do so because changing history would keep their culture from coming to be. Oliver goes to his room, feeling ill. In a short scene set in the future, the final version of Cenbe's symphonia is performed, including a powerful image of a face, apparently that of Oliver in the \\"emotional crisis\\" induced by his conversation with Cenbe. Oliver writes down a warning about the time travelers, which he hopes will change history. However, he dies of a new plague, apparently brought to Earth by the meteor. The house and the unread message are destroyed in a futile effort at quarantine. What would become known as \\"The Blue Death\\" enters history as a disaster comparable with the Black Death of the Middle Ages, both being part of Cenbe's symphonia (as well as the Great Plague of London). Eventually humanity manages to develop a cure and an inoculation against it, which would be given to time-travelers returning to this period—but that comes far too late for Oliver Wilson and countless others. Reception Readers immediately acclaimed the story. It has been called \\"great\\",Gunn, Voices, p. 208 \\"perhaps the ultimate expression of Catherine L. Moore's art\\", \\"her masterpiece\\", \\"hauntingly memorable\\", \\"classic\\" and \\"one of the most brilliant stories in modern science fiction.\\" One reviewer praised its \\"carefully controlled suspense\\". Derivative works Robert Silverberg wrote a story about the aftermath, \\"In Another Country\\", which was published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in 1989 and reprinted with \\"Vintage Season\\" as a Tor Double in 1990. Silverberg also took up the theme of time-travel used for tourism in his novel \\"Up the Line\\". The 1992 American film Timescape, also titled Grand Tour: Disaster in Time, was loosely based on \\"Vintage Season\\", though with a happy ending substituted for the somber conclusion of Moore's original.

The Mau said they were not hostile to the Navy administration, but believed the time had come for a change.

The bridge was designed by Watkin George and built in 1793 for his employer, the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, to support both a tramway and an aqueduct to carry limestone and water into the works. A Grade II* listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument, the Pont-y-Cafnau is the world's earliest surviving iron railway bridge.  History  The Cyfarthfa Ironworks were founded in 1765 and grew to the world's largest ironworks by the early 19th century. In 1771, the works obtained the right to quarry limestone from the Gurnos Quarry for use in the works' blast furnaces, and a gauge tramway was built between 1792 and 1793 to carry the limestone from the quarry into the plant. Pont-y-Cafnau is situated shortly downstream of the confluence of the Taff Fawr and the Taff Fechan to form the Taff. A weir had previously been built upstream of the plant on each river, and leats were built to convey water into the works. The leat from the Taff Fawr was conveyed in a cast iron elevated aqueduct which ran along the north bank and crossed the Taff Fechan before crossing the Taff at Pont-y- Cafnau and entering the works to power a 50-foot cast iron water wheel known as Aeolus. The leat from Taff Fechan was at ground level and again crossed the Taff at Pont-y-Cafnau. This supplied water to the Cyfarthfa brick works.Rowson, Stephen & Wright, Ian. The Glamorganshire and Aberdare Canals, Black Dwarf Publications 2001, 65,69 The three levels of Pont-y-Cafnau thus carried the elevated Taff Fawr leat, the tramway and Taff Fechan leat across the Taff River. The bridge was built between January and June 1793, replacing a previous wooden structure, and is the world's oldest known iron railway bridge. The elevated trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat was removed by 1850, having been replaced by a leat along the south bank of that river.  Design  Pont-y-Cafnau, showing detail of joints The present bridge was designed by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and a partner in the business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as a girder supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the rail chairs are integrally cast. Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by dovetail and mortise and tenon joints commonly used in wooden structures.  Heritage  On 22 August 1975, the bridge was listed as a Grade II* listed building (reference number 11408). It is also listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument (reference number GM424). It has been refurbished by the local authority and is used as a footbridge.

He was the writer of such notable songs as \\"Gloire au 17ème\\" and \\"La Butte Rouge\\". Biography Montéhus was the eldest child of 22 in an improverished working-class family of Jewish descent. A Child of the Commune Montéhus was born in Paris after the Paris Commune of 1871. According to him, his father Abraham Brunschwig had been among the rebels, but there is no source to verify this claim. Nevertheless, Montéhus was raised in a post-Commune context, which accounts for his commitment to left-wing politics. \\"Revolutionary jingoist\\" as he liked to present himself, he was close to the \\"wretched of the Earth\\" spoken of by Eugène Pottier in L'Internationale. He began to sing in public at the age of 12, in 1884, a decade before the beginning of the Dreyfus Affair. He published his first song (Au camarade du 153ème) in 1897. It was then that he adopted his pseudonym, easier to bear than his name in the context of strong antisemitism. In 1907, he published Gloire au 17ème in honour of the regiment of soldiers who refused to fire on a demonstration of wine growers in Béziers. A Committed Singer In the second half of the 19th century, the song was central to the popular culture. Books, expensive as they were, were not accessible to the working classes. When it contained a strong political element, the song could be a powerful tool of propaganda. Montéhus was one of the singers of the red revolt, along with Jean-Baptiste Clément (1836–1903), writer of the song Le Temps des cerises, Eugène Pottier (1816–1887), writer of L'Internationale, Jules Jouy (1855–1897), writer of V'là l'choléra qu'arrive, Les Anarchistes de Chicago, Pierre Dupont (1821–1870), Le chant des ouvriers, Le chant du vote, Gaston Couté (1880–1911) Le gars qu'a mal tourné, etc. In his lively, driven songs, Montéhus opposed war, capitalist exploitation, prostitution, poverty, religious hypocrisy, but also the income tax: :Au lieu d'imposer l'travailleur qui enrichit l'gouvernement :Imposez plutôt les noceurs [les capitalistes] qui gaspillent tant d'argent.L'impôt sur les fainéants, répertoire Montéhus He also defended the cause of women in a remarkable way. La grève des Mères (The Mothers' Strike) was legally banned on 5 October and Montéhus condemned for \\"incitement to abortion\\". A Friend of Lenin Montéhus maintained relations with Vladimir Lenin; moreover, the latter made reference to this in his correspondence. In a letter to Lev Kamenev, Lenin wrote: \\"Ah! If I could listen to Montéhus again!\\".Marc Robine, « Montéhus, Le chansonnier humanitaire. Enregistrements originaux 1905–1936 » EPM, Paris At the time of his exile in France (between 1909 and 1912), Lenin gave a series of conferences in a room of either the Rive Gauche or Bobino (the places is uncertain). At Lenin's request, Montéhus sang in the first part to attract a sizable audience. The people who came to listen to the \\"humanitarian singer\\" were also invited to listen to the Bolshevik activist after the intermission. The relations between art and politics prefigured the agitprop (art in the service of political discourse and/or ideology) put in place in the USSR beginning in the 1920s. A Revolutionary Jingoist During the First World War, Montéhus, like many others, underwent a radical change of political opinion. He made himself the zealous changer of the Union Sacrée and sang militarist songs. One may draw a comparison with the painting of Picasso, who in the same period renounced cubism (considered \\"too German\\") for a more academic style (considered \\"French\\"). It was then that Montéhus sang La Guerre finale, a grotesque détournement of L'Internationale: :\\"Et maintenant tous à l'ouvrage :Amis, on ne meurt qu'une fois !\\" Similarly, in Lettre d'un Socialo (sung to the tune of L'air du Clairon by Paul Déroulède), he explained that the time had come for La Marseillaise, while waiting to be able to sing L'Internationale once again: :Nous chantons La Marseillaise :Car dans ces terribles jours :On laisse L'Internationale :Pour la victoire finale :On la chantera au retour. Montéhus was the image of the working people, who left en masse for the front contrary to the fears of the state adjutant who had overestimated the workers' commitment to pacifism. In a song impregnated with the racism of his time, entitled L'Arbi, Montéhus held xenophobic intentions: :Moi li sait bien, toi pas voulu guerre :Toi, li Français, c'est kif kif le bon Dieu.Marc Robine : « Montéhus, Le chansonnier humanitaire. Enregistrements originaux 1905–1936 » EPM, Paris Plus loin : :Moi suis content voir Paris : J'suis content, c'est bézef bonno :A couper cabêche aux sales Pruscots :car eux, du tout, pas gentils :As pas peur, as pas peur, Sidi :Si Pruscots venir, moi coupe kiki.Marc Robine : « Montéhus, Le chansonnier humanitaire. Enregistrements originaux 1905–1936 » EPM, Paris During these four years of war, he did not cease to compose warlike songs (La Dernière victime, La Voix des mourants, La Vision sanglante, Debout les Morts !, etc.), he would never be mobilised and thus never know the horrors of the front. On the other hand, on the stage of the Olympia, he was wounded in the head singing warlike songs. At the end of the war in 1918, for his good and loyal services, he received the Croix de Guerre. Disgrace After the war, Montéhus faced a rather long period of disgrace. He ceased to enroll in the Popular Front. He would attempt to redeem himself in 1923 by composing La Butte Rouge (The Red Mound), which makes reference to the Mound of Bapeaume, theatre of violent battles at the Somme during the offensive of the summer of 1916 (and not, contrary to a common error, the Paris Commune of 1871, strongly evoked in the work of de Montéhus). In this song, he takes on those responsible for the carnage: > [...] car les bandits qui sont cause des guerres > n'en meurent jamais, on ne tue qu'les innocents. Support for the Popular Front During the 1930s, he was a member of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). At the advent of the Popular Front, at the age of 64, Montéhus was again at the forefront with Le décor va changer, Vas-Y Léon !\\",Anthologie de la chanson française année 1936 Le Cri des grévistes, L'Espoir d'un gueux, songs in which he supported the Popular Front and Léon Blum. Under the Vichy Regime Montéhus was not sent to a concentration camp, but he was forced to wear the yellow star from 1942 until the Liberation of France. In 1944, he wrote the Chant des Gaullistes (Song of the Gaullists). After the Liberation He received the Legion of Honour from Paul Ramadier en 1947. All but forgotten, supported only by his family, he died in 1952 in Paris.

They gained a franchise to sell Fisher and Paykel appliances, and opened their first shop in Queen Street in 1951. The business was successful, and opened new stores in Karangahape Road, Takapuna and Newmarket over the next few years. At its peak, there were ten stores around Auckland. Stewart's home phone number appeared on the chain's advertisements for many years, so that customers could contact him directly with any problems they had. Few people actually rang him, and those who did were unfailingly polite. Decline All but the Takapuna store were sold to owner-operators by the early 1980s, but still operated under the Hill and Stewart name. The Takapuna store was sold by Stewart in 1987.

This idea was proposed by Paul Bernd Spahn in 1995. Early history The initial idea for a currency transaction tax is attributed to James Tobin in 1972, a concept now known as a Tobin tax. On June 16, 1995. Spahn, in his analysis of the original idea, concluded that the concept was not viable and suggested an alternative solution to the problem of managing exchange-rate volatility. Concept According to Spahn, \\"Analysis has shown that the Tobin tax as originally proposed is not viable and should be laid aside for good.\\" Furthermore, he believes that \\"it is virtually impossible to distinguish between normal liquidity trading and speculative 'noise' trading. If the tax is generally applied at high rates, it will severely impair financial operations and create international liquidity problems, especially if derivatives are taxed as well. A lower tax rate would reduce the negative impact on financial markets, but not mitigate speculation where expectations of an exchange rate change exceed the tax margin.\\" In 1995, Spahn suggested an alternative, involving \\"a two- tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax, plus an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates as a piggyback. The latter would be dormant in times of normal financial activities, and be activated only in the case of speculative attacks. The mechanism allowing the identification of abnormal trading in world financial markets would make reference to a 'crawling peg' with an appropriate exchange rate band. The exchange rate would move freely within this band without transactions being taxed. Only transactions effected at exchange rates outside the permissible range would become subject to tax. This would automatically induce stabilizing behavior on the part of market participants.\\" Proposals On June 15, 2004, the Belgian Parliament approved a bill implementing a Spahn tax. According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Spahn tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law.ECB (2004). Opinion of the European Central Bank (CON/2004/34) In November 2004, Belgium submitted this law for an opinion to the European Central Bank, which provided both an economic and legal assessment. Its summary stated: > \\"...the ECB concludes that the economic and monetary usefulness of a tax, > such as envisaged by the draft law, is highly questionable, given the > uncertainty of its claimed benefits and the likely welfare costs arising > from distortions in the working of financial markets. This assessment is > reinforced by the difficulties expected with respect to its implementation.\\" It continued: > \\"...the ECB is of the opinion that the introduction by a euro area Member > State of a tax, such as envisaged by the draft law, is incompatible with the > Treaty.\\" See also * Bank for International Settlements * Central banks - which issue currency * Credit crunch * Currencies * Currency crisis * Currency transaction tax * Exorbitant privilege * Financial markets * Financial transaction tax * Fluctuation in exchange rates * Foreign exchange controls * Foreign exchange derivative * Foreign exchange market * Liquidity crisis * Money market * Noise (economic) * Paul Bernd Spahn * Speculation * Speculative attack * Speculation in foreign exchange markets * Spot market * Sudden stop (economics) * Tobin tax * Transfer tax * Volatility (finance) * Volatility risk * Consequences of currency volatility Related economic crises * 1994 economic crisis in Mexico * 1997 Asian Financial Crisis * 1998 Russian financial crisis * Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002) * Financial crisis of 2007–2010 ReferencesExternal links * Currency Transaction Taxes - Library of links to legislation, proposals, reports, articles and archives - from Global Policy Forum Category:Foreign exchange market Category:Financial transaction tax Category:International taxation ","title":"Spahn tax"},{"id":"25795319","text":"Michelle Khine, Ph.D. is a distinguished scientist and innovator at the University of California, Irvine, co-founder of Fluxion Biosciences Inc., the scientific founder of the Shrink nano-technology platform, as well as the Assistant and Founding Professor of the School of Engineering at UC Merced.

Career Photographic portrait of L. Forbes WinslowBorn in Marylebone in London, the son of psychiatrist Forbes Benignus Winslow and Susan Winslow née Holt, Winslow was possibly the most controversial psychiatrist of his time. As a boy he was brought up in lunatic asylums owned by his father, and was educated at Rugby School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, transferring to Downing College at the University of Cambridge after four terms, where he took the MB degree in 1870. He was also a DCL(1873) of Trinity College Oxford and LL.D. of Cambridge University. A keen cricketer, Winslow captained the Downing College XI.Winslow on the Cricinfo website In July 1864 he was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team which played against South Wales, in which team was W. G. Grace. In 1871 he was appointed a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP). He spent his medical career in an attempt to persuade the courts that crime and alcoholism were the result of mental instability. His attempt in 1878 to have Mrs Georgina Weldon committed as a lunatic at the instigation of her estranged husband William Weldon resulted in one of the most notorious court cases of the nineteenth century.Judith R. Walkowitz, Science and the Seance: Transgressions of Gender and Genre in Late Victorian London Representations 22 (Spring 1988):3–29. The public notoriety the Weldon case caused earned him the displeasure of the medical establishment, which continued even after his death. He became an adherent of the benefits of hypnotism in dealing with psychiatric cases.Lyttleton Forbes Winslow's Obituary in Light 14 June 1913 He took an active role in securing a reprieve for the four people sentenced to death for the murder by starvation of Mrs. Staunton at Penge in 1877. In 1878 he inquired into the mental condition of the Rev. Mr. Dodwell, who had shot at Sir George Jessel, the Master of the Rolls. Other trials in which Winslow was involved were those of Percy Lefroy Mapleton, convicted of the murder on the Brighton line; that of Florence Maybrick, and that of Amelia Dyer, the Reading baby farmer.FMonika Sing-Leeull text of Recollections of Forty Years by L. Forbes Winslow Published by John Ouseley Ltd, London (1910) He also appeared in many civil actions.Winslow's obituary in The Times 9 June 1913 Jack the Ripper Forbes Winslow conjures up the secret actions of Jack the Ripper, from the Illustrated Police News Winslow managed his father's asylums after his death in 1874, but these were removed from his control following a family feud, so he turned his attention to detective work. Also in 1874 he changed his surname to Forbes-Winslow. In 1888, with a little manipulation of the evidence, Winslow came to believe he knew the identity of Jack the Ripper, and believed that if he was given a team of six Police Constables he could catch the murderer.Dr. Lyttleton Forbes Winslow on Casebook: Jack the Ripper website Winslow's suspect was Canadian G. Wentworth Smith, who had come to London to work for the Toronto Trust Society, and who lodged with a Mr and Mrs Callaghan at 27 Sun Street, Finsbury Square. Mr Callaghan became suspicious of Smith when he was heard saying that all prostitutes should be drowned. Smith also talked and moaned to himself, and kept three loaded revolvers hidden in a chest of drawers. Callaghan went to Winslow to express his suspicions, and he in turn contacted the police, who fully investigated his theory and showed it to be without foundation. Nevertheless, convinced that he was correct, for many years Winslow declared his theory at every chance, and claimed that his actions were responsible for forcing Jack the Ripper into abandoning murder and fleeing the country. In his 1910 memoirs Winslow describes how he spent days and nights in Whitechapel: \\"The detectives knew me, the lodging house keepers knew me, and at last the poor creatures of the streets came to know me. In terror they rushed to me with every scrap of information which might, to my mind, be of value to me. The frightened women looked for hope in my presence. They felt reassured and welcomed me to their dens and obeyed my commands eagerly, and I found the bits of information I wanted\\". When Winslow's claims about knowing the identity of the Ripper were reported in the English press Scotland Yard sent Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to interview him. Confronted with this senior police officer, Forbes Winslow immediately began to back-pedal. He said the story printed in the newspaper was not accurate and misrepresented the entire conversation between himself and the reporter. He further stated that the reporter had tricked him into talking about the Ripper murders. In fact, Winslow had never given any information to the police with the exception of his earlier theory concerning an escaped lunatic, a theory which even Forbes Winslow abandoned.The Lodger on Casebook: Jack the Ripper website According to Donald McCormick, for a short period the police suspected Winslow of involvement in the killings because of his persistence and constant agitation in the Jack the Ripper case, and they checked on his movements at the time of the Ripper murders.McCormick quoted in Cullen, Tom (1965) Autumn of Terror, London: The Bodley Head, p. 91 He gained further publicity, and visited New York City in August 1895, to chair a meeting on lunacy at an International Medico-Legal Congress.Cullen, p. 91, n. 1 He also appeared as an expert defence witness in some American cases involving lunacy. Spiritualism Winslow was the author of the 1877 pamphlet Spiritualistic Madness which identified spiritualism as a cause of insanity.Anna Green, Kathleen Troup. (1999). The Houses of History: A Critical Reader in Twentieth-century History and Theory. New York University Press. p. 312. He wrote that many believers in spiritualism were women and victims of their own gullibility. Winslow wrote that most believers in spiritualism were insane and suffer from mental delusions. He affirmed that there were \\"nearly ten thousand [such] persons in America\\" who had been confined in lunatic asylums.Frank Lauterbach, Jan Alber. (2009). Stones of Law, Bricks of Shame: Narrating Imprisonment in the Victorian Age. University of Toronto Press. p. 264. Personal life Forbes Winslow in 1910 His older brother was the Revd Forbes Edward Winslow, the vicar of Epping, while his sister, Susanna Frances, married the humorist Arthur William à Beckett. Forbes Winslow published his memoirs, Recollections of Forty Years, in 1910, and also wrote the Handbook For Attendants on the Insane. He founded the British Hospital for Mental Disorders in London, and was a lecturer on insanity at Charing Cross Hospital and was a physician to the West End Hospital and the North London Hospital for Consumption. A member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and a Vice-President of the Psycho—Therapeutic Society, he married twice. In the 1880s, he was the owner of the famous progenitor of the modern English Mastiff, Ch. Crown Prince.Andersson, D. D. (1999). The Mastiff: Aristocratic Guardian. Doral Publishing. Winslow died at his home in Devonshire Street, London, of a heart attack, aged 69. He left a widow, three sons and a daughter, Dulcie Sylvia, who, in 1906, married Roland St John Braddell (1880–1966).

Life The elder son of John Rowe, he was born in London in 1657. He was probably educated by Theophilus Gale. In 1678 he succeeded Gale, both as pastor of the independent church in Holborn and as tutor in the academy at Newington Green. He moved his congregation to a meeting-house at Girdlers' Hall, Basinghall Street, and took his academy successively to Clapham and, about 1687, to Little Britain. His ministry was successful; but it was as a tutor, especially in philosophy, that he made his mark as an early adopter of new ideas. He was the first to desert the traditional textbooks, introducing his pupils, about 1680, to what was known as ‘free philosophy.’ Rowe was a Cartesian at a time when the Aristotelian philosophy was still dominant in the older schools of learning; but while in physics he adhered to Descartes against the rising influence of Isaac Newton, he also became one of the earliest exponents of John Locke. His students included John Evans, D.D., Henry Grove, Josiah Hort, John Hughes the poet, Jeremiah Hunt, D.D., Daniel Neal, and Isaac Watts. Rowe was a Calvinist in theology, but few of his pupils adhered to the same system without some modification. In 1699 he became one of the Tuesday lecturers at Pinners' Hall. He died suddenly on 18 August 1705, and was buried with his father in Bunhill Fields. Family Benoni Rowe (1658–1706) was his brother-in-law, husband to his sister Sarah.Dewey D. Wallace, jun. in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; older works say a younger brother. He was born in London, and educated for the ministry. His first known settlement was at Epsom, Surrey, about 1689. He succeeded Stephen Lobb in 1699 as pastor of the independent church in Fetter Lane. He died on 30 March 1706, and was burie in Bunhill Fields. He left two sons: Thomas (1687–1715), husband of Elizabeth Rowe; and Theophilus.

The Inuit are the most widespread and perhaps the best known aboriginal people on earth.Morrison, David. 2004. Inuit Culture. In The Oxford Companion to Canadian History. Gerald Hallowell, ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. As a very large indigenous group inhabiting the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia, the Inuit exhibit many variations in cultural practices and customs. In Inuit communities, the women play a crucial role in the survival of the group. The responsibilities faced by Inuit women were considered equally as important as those faced by the men. Because of this, the women were given due respect and are given an equal share of influence or power. Recent modernization and urbanization has transformed traditional Inuit culture and influenced the role of women within the culture. These changes include both positive and negative impacts on the overall well-being of Inuit women. Role in society=Family structure and marriage \\"Madonna of the North\\" (Inuit woman with child on back, ) In Inuit culture, marriage was not a choice, but a necessity. Inuit men and women needed each other to survive. Married couples had to work together to overcome nearly impossible living conditions. Because every individual had to rely on a partner to survive, marriages were often arranged at birth to ensure the survival of the family. Love marriages, or choice marriages, existed, but these were all but arranged because there were usually few eligible partners. A young woman was eligible for marriage after puberty, but a man had to prove he was efficient enough in hunting to support a family before he could marry. Inuit marriages rarely included large ceremonies; couples were often considered married after the birth of their first child. There were monogamous and polygamous marriages, but polygyny was rare because few men could afford to support multiple wives. Families exchanged gifts before marriages, but no official bride price or dowry was paid. Although men were considered the head of the family, both genders could demand a divorce.Lowry, Shannon. 1994. Natives of the Far North: Alaska’s Vanishing Culture Through the Eye of Edward Sheriff Curtis. Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books. However, divorce was frowned upon because it was bad for the family and the community as a whole.Billson, Janet Mancini and Kyra Mancini. 2007. Inuit Women: Their Powerful Spirit in a Century of Change. Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. Spouses were sometimes traded or exchanged, and women had some say in this process. This was a common alternative to divorce because neither family would be without a component vital to its survival — a mother and a wife. In Inuit culture, the family was typically represented by a kudlik (lamp) or a hearth, which was the property and responsibility of the wife. This lamp had significant symbolic meaning in the family, the community, and the culture.LeMoine, Genevieve. 2003. Woman of the House: Gender, Architecture, and Ideology in Dorset Prehistory. Arctic Anthropology 40(1): 121–138. Food production and preparation Hunting and fishing were the primary sources of food for the Inuit people, and men were traditionally responsible for these duties. Women's duties included gathering other sources of food, such as eggs and berries, and preparing the food the hunters brought back. Seals, walrus, whales and caribou were the most common targets of Inuit hunters. Animals killed by the hunters needed to be butchered and frozen quickly, before they went bad or froze before being butchered. Women were traditionally responsible for the butchering, skinning, and cooking of animals taken by the hunters.Friesen, Max T. 1999. Resource Structure, Scalar Stress, and the Development of Inuit Social Organization. World Archaeology 31(1): 21–37. In Inuit culture, it was believed that the women's respect for the animals killed during hunting trips, and subsequent care when butchering them, would ensure successful hunts. Food, as well as other resources, were often shared throughout the community as needed. Women were in charge of the distribution of food to families in the community. The Inuit moved with the seasons to maximize their chances of a successful hunt; their entire families often moved with them. Because of this, tools and other items used by the Inuit for hunting and food preparation had to be light and easily transported. Among some Inuit groups this led to the development of complex tools such as light and powerful metal harpoons and wood stoves, which were being used by the late 1800s.Labrador, Nachvak and Kongu Labrador. 2006. A New Design: When Europeans Met Inuit in Labrador, Home and Hearth Were Reshaped. The Beaver: Exploring Canada’s History 86(3): 26–29. Children, reproduction, and motherhood Childbirth and childcare were two of the most important responsibilities for an Inuit woman. Inuit parents showed a very high level of warmth and affection to their children. Inuit children usually began to contribute to the family and community by the age of 12 through activities like picking berries and hunting small game. During this period, they learned skills from their parents through close observation. Learning through observation was the chosen method because it was not practical for children to practice their skills by sewing valuable skins or accompanying men on important hunting trips. Women raised boys and girls. Men taught boys certain skills, such as hunting, and women taught girls certain skills, such as sewing. Kinship is an important factor to an Inuit child's cultural belonging. Starting from the time the child is born, he or she is introduced to their duties and ties of kinship. One way the Inuit tribe achieves this is by the practice referred to as name-soul. After a member of the family has passed away, their name is used as the name for a child of the same family line. The name provides a child with a cultural tie, a belonging within their community, and a personal identity. In addition, name-soul allows for prior family members to carry on their legacy in their family lineage even after passing. The children are raised in a family- oriented environment, as their name serves as a reminder that the group comes first. There were no boys and girls names in Inuit culture, so it was common for a girl to have the name of her grandfather, for example. Children were taught at a young age to listen to their parents and respect their elders, and were treated with more autonomy than non-Inuit children. Over disciplining a child was seen as counter productive so children were rarely punished for transgressions. Learning was regarded as a partnership between child and adult, with children being more guided through life than directly taught or lectured. Adoption was very common in Inuit culture, and it was often very informal. Unwanted babies, or babies a family could not support, could be offered to another family. If the other family accepted, the adoption was complete.Kent, Heather. 2000. MDs Get Crash Course in Inuit Culture as Young Patients Arrive in Ottawa. Canadian Medical Association Journal 162(10): 1481. Infanticide was common when conditions were desperate and the group was threatened by starvation.Inuit Women: Their Powerful Spirit in a Century of Change By Janet Mancini Billson A mother abandoned an infant in hopes that someone less desperate might find and adopt the child before the cold or animals killed it. The belief that the Inuit regularly resorted to infanticide may be due in part to studies done by Asen Balikci, Milton Freeman, and David Riches among the Netsilik, along with the trial of Kikkik.Kikkik, When Justice Was Done Children who could not be supported by a community due to a lack of resources were often killed as infants. This was seen as best for the culture and prevented the suffering of other family members. Other responsibilities  Along with childbirth and childcare, women were responsible for sewing skins to make clothes; preserving, processing, and cooking food (as mentioned above); caring for the sick and elderly; and helping to build and take care of the family's shelter. Warm, light, and serviceable clothing was perhaps the greatest achievement of the Inuit. For protection against the bitter Arctic winter, it has not been surpassed by even the best modern clothing. The clothing created by women was vital because life in Arctic conditions was not possible without extremely well-made clothing to protect from the bitter cold. The clothing was created by the careful sewing of animal skins and furs using ivory needles, which were highly valuable in Inuit society. The process of preparing skins to be sewn together for creating clothes was done by women and was an arduous task. Skins had to be scraped, stretched, and softened before they were ready to be sewn. In addition to this, the households Inuit women were expected to help construct and care for could range from igloos, to semi- subterranean sod houses, to tents in the summer months. This required an understanding of complex architectural concepts, as well as the principles of insulation. A good amount of strength was required to construct Inuit shelters. Because of this, Inuit women often worked together and enlisted the help of men to build their homes. For both practical and social purposes, these houses would be built close together or were made large enough for more than one family to live in. Status in Inuit culture=Sexual division of labour Jobs in Inuit culture were not considered men's work or women's work, but the Inuit did believe in men's skills and women's skills. For example, hunting was generally done by the men. Sewing clothes, cooking and preparing food, gathering food outside of hunting, and caring for the home were generally done by women. This does not mean that women never hunted, nor that men never helped with other jobs. This was just how the work was traditionally divided. Women hunted and boated for enjoyment or when food was scarce and the community needed extra hunters. Men and women worked together to create a functioning culture. The men would not be able to go hunting without the warm clothes the women sewed for them, and the women would not have enough food without the meat the men brought back from their hunting trips. Because of this, the work done by women received equal respect to the work done by men. While men and women generally did different work, one type of work was not considered better or more important than other types. It is easy to think that because men only had one job that they did less work. The truth is that hunting was extremely physically demanding and time consuming, and often required traveling for days or weeks at a time. As a result, the sexual division of labour in Inuit culture was relatively equal in the amount of work done. Lack of power and influence While women were respected by men, and often treated as equals, they did not have equal power in the community. Important decisions, such as when to migrate and where to, could be made exclusively by men. Inuit people had as little government as any group on earth, but some groups did have tribal councils or groups of elders who made decisions for the community. These councils were almost exclusively male. Because of this, the Inuit women had little to no say in some of their communities' most important decisions. Men usually had the final say in issues such as arranging marriages and adoption or infanticide, which have a huge impact on women's lives. Although women had a relatively high position socially, and had significant control of their own home, as well as ceremonially important jobs such as lighting and tending to lamps and distributing food, their power was usually limited to those areas. In addition to this, if men were unhappy with how a woman was handling her responsibilities, they could take over or transfer her work to another woman in the community whom they considered more capable. With women having less power, they are often put in difficult positions when they are not involved in the decision-making process. For example, a pregnant woman, or a woman with a newborn child, may not be able to migrate hundreds of miles through Arctic conditions in search of better hunting grounds. Factors such as these are rarely taken into account when men are the sole decision-makers for a community. Effects of modernization and change on Inuit women Inupiat) woman in traditional clothing, Nome, Alaska, 1907 After contact with other cultures, the Inuit were introduced to new technologies and modernization, which changed their lives drastically. The Inuit are now a modern people and, like almost all indigenous peoples, no longer live the way their ancestors did. This is especially true of Inuit women. New role in the culture After modernization, the Inuit began to move into Arctic towns and participate in wage labor, government employment, community councils, and the acquisition of modern clothing, housing, and vehicles. Male Inuit initially took the lead in assimilation by learning the language of the arriving culture and taking on modern, wage earning jobs; however, a lack of education began to hinder the men's ability to find and keep jobs.McElroy, Ann. 1975. Canadian Arctic Modernization and Change in Female Inuit Role Identification. American Ethnologist 2(4): 662–686. As a result of this, women began to lead the way in cultural assimilation. Women started by finding work as domestic servants, store clerks, hospital aides, classroom assistants, interpreters, and in weaving and knitting shops. Inuit women tend to go to school more than Inuit men, and this is especially true of college. Some universities in regions where the Inuit are prominent, such as the Nunavut Arctic College, have programs designed specifically for the Inuit people. Women, much more often than men, take advantage of these programs.Paskey, Janice. 1999. Hunting for Seals and for Inuit Culture at Nunavut Arctic College. Chronicle of Higher Education 46(13): B4 Because Inuit women seek more education and, subsequently, better jobs, they have increasingly taken on the role as primary wage earner for the family. This has caused men to assume responsibilities in the house that were traditionally done by the women, such as raising children and keeping the home in order. Changes in status and power The \\"role reversal\\" that has begun to occur in Inuit society has given women a major increase in power and influence. Women have begun to seek more power for themselves, both in decision-making in the family and the culture as a whole. As the primary wage earners, working women are now considered the heads of their families and have the upper hand in making decisions for them. This has complicated the relationship between Inuit men and women. Men have begun to resent women for \\"stealing their rightful place as the head of the family\\" and may turn to drinking and/or drug abuse to deal with these issues. Reactions such as these perpetuate the cycle, as men are less likely to be employed after exhibiting these behaviors. Another change that has begun is that Inuit women have increasingly started to run for political office. Although the positions they seek are often at the community and local levels, this increase in activism reflects the new confidence Inuit women have found in the modern world. The second premier of Nunavut was a woman, Eva Aariak, who was one of two female MLAs in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. The current mayor of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, is a woman, Elisapee Sheutiapik, as is the Member of Parliament for Nunavut, Leona Aglukkaq, who is also the Canadian Minister of Health. Health issues Scientists have found that the Inuit people seem to experience more illness and health issues than other groups, especially the women and children, and especially in the post-modernization period. A possible explanation is that the Inuit diet was traditionally high in fat and protein and low in fruits and vegetables.Jorgenson, Marit Eika with Helen Moustgaard, Peter Bjerregaard, and Knut Borch-Johnsen. 2006. Gender Differences in the Association between Westernization and Metabolic Risk Among Greenland Inuit. European Journal of Epidemiology 21(10): 741–748. More likely explanations include a change in diet after modernization, a decrease in physical activity as traditional jobs such as hunting and constructing homes are practiced less and less, or exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Whatever the cause, diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol are serious problems for the Inuit people. Even more troubling, studies have shown that these issues are worse for women than other groups. Another major issue facing the Inuit is that, after modernization, suicide, violence, depression, and substance abuse have become increasingly prevalent. This may be the result of psychological issues stemming from not having a place in society or being torn between modern life and the culture of their ancestors. Sadly, suicide, depression, and substance abuse are increasingly becoming associated with Inuit women. The pressure for Inuit women to conform to the dress and behavior of modern Western culture is immense; however, many aspects of modern culture are foreign to the Inuit women and are directly at odds with the traditional practices of their culture. Contemporary Inuit women are trapped between cultures, and the results are devastating to their physical and psychological health.

They live on the Yuat River in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, and speak the Mundugumor language.  Anthropological studies by Margaret Mead  The Mundugumor tribe was first studied by anthropologist Margaret Mead during her field studies in Papua New Guinea from 1931 to 1933. In fact, the only in-depth research done on the Mundugumor tribe was conducted by Mead. She and her husband, Reo Fortune spent two years in the Sepik River region studying the Aarapesh, the Mundugumor, and the Tchambuli tribes. Their second field site was inhabited by the Mundugumor who, until three years previous, were without governmental control and thrived in a society centered around war, cannibalism, and headhunting. Based on this background filled with traditions and customs of aggression, Mead noted the Mundugumor as being actively masculine, positively sexed, virile, jealous, violent, hard, and arrogant. The attitudes of the Mundugumor that Mead and Fortune picked up during their field study were notably influenced by Mundugumor ways of marriage and directly influenced female parenting styles. Mundugumor women were strongly affected by the marriage customs and large responsibilities that come with being a mother. They dealt with each milestone in life in unique ways rooted in the traditions of the Mundugumor tribe. Marriage Marriage among the Mundugumor was consummated in many different fashions, all of them encompassing competition and hostility. Marriage was never a quick process, but always arranged in some form. Traditional Mundugumor customs required every man to acquire a wife by giving his sister in return for another man's sister. Because of this requirement, early bonds were created between fathers and daughters and separately between mothers and sons. Brothers and sisters did not communicate with each other and their bond was of pure exchange and benefit on both ends. Mundugumor men were forbidden from choosing a mate within their own clan and a father's clan and an exchange was forbidden from involving two women of the same group. But despite these rules, they were easily ignored and the obtainment of an ideal mate overshadowed the rules of the tribe. Affairs and elopements often spawned the desire for marriage, although arrangements had to be made for exchange among the two families. Polygyny was widely practiced among Mundugumor men, the social ideal being to have as many as eight to ten wives. This socially acceptable way of marriage also created aggression from a wife towards her husband. In any creation of marriage among two individuals, conflict was present and marriage was only valued as obtainment of labor and fertility for the husband. Arranged Marriages Among the Mundugumor, arranged marriages were the most common and widely accepted way of creating a husband and wife bond. All arranged marriages in Mundugumor culture involved familial ties and acceptance. Marriages were formed around brother-and-sister exchange. This exchange caused brothers to have pre-emptive rights over their sisters as they acted as their personal passage into marriage. The sisters were taught by their mothers to appreciate this fact and the full value of marriage through exchange. Occasionally, a wife could be paid for with a valuable flute as an exchange. The flute demonstrated purity and virginity and held great value in the eyes of the Mundugumor. Men without sisters could not participate in the brother-and-sister exchange for marriage. They were forced to fight for their wives physically and mentally. A family with many sons and no daughters held a future full of physical feuding. Arranged marriages were also common among two very young adolescents. If there were two sibling pairs around the same age, a peacemaking ceremony could occur between the two fathers, arranging marriage among the pairs. Many times though, because the Mundugumor were so centered around sister for sister exchange, they paid little attention to relative ages. It is also true that an older sister could be the property of her considerably younger brother. When a girl chose her husband or a marriage arrangement was made, a wife also had to be selected for her brother. If a girl was nearing adolescence, she was sent almost immediately to live in her betrothed husband's household. This allowed her own kin to shift the responsibility for her elopement if it was to occur. In these situations, the husband was almost always younger than the wife. As the girl developed in this household, she may catch the eye of the father or an elder brother of her boy husband. If this occurred, a struggle would develop among the family members. If she preferred one member of the family above another, she chose that male as her husband and her choice was final. If she hated the entire family as a group, she was fought over with little say in the matter, unless she was able to find a lover who would elope with her. If she failed to catch the eye of another male family member, the household focused on chaperoning the girl. This chaperoning involved the forceful compliance of her boy husband to engage in sexual relations with his official wife. This young couple then had the ability to begin creating a family and continue their lives together. Affairs Despite the prevalence of arranged marriages among the Mundugumor, affairs could occur in hopes of spawning marriage or elopement. Because of the stress on arrangement marriage, there was a violent preference for the selection of one's mate. Sexual affairs occurred in the bush of New Guinea, out of eye and earshot of other members of the tribe. Those who took a lover had to conceal their activity to avoid teasing and disapproval. Sexual affairs involved rough foreplay that began with violent scratching and biting matches to create the maximum amount of excitement. Physical violence was often accompanied by the breaking of the arrows or baskets and ornaments of the beloved to demonstrate the passion that was consumed. Members of both sexes are known and expected to be aggressive in their sexual encounter, but also equally jealous of one another and vengeful of other affairs. Some girls had many affairs before they were even married. This concealment of this type of unmarried affair was even more important. The Mundugumor valued virginity in their daughters and their wives and virginity was crucial in the brother-and-sister exchange. Only a virgin could be exchanged for a virgin. If a woman's lack of virginity was exposed, she could only be exchanged for a woman whose exchange value was equally damaged in a similar fashion. Married men had more affairs than married women. A young girl's first lover was often a married man. Because of her vulnerability in the situation, the girl often attempted to persuade the married man to elope with her and take her as his wife. If he protested, she may run away with him anyway. If the girl was lucky enough to have a sympathetic father or her lover has a younger sister that was available as a wife for her brother, she may have been able to approach her father about her hopes to marry this man. These conditions were rare. If confronting her father was not an option, the girl would many times run away with her dowry in her possession. This dowry (a sacred flute) was as important to the girl's family as it is to her, so a fight often follows. Her relatives would pursue her as she attempted to escape and a battle was fought. Around one third of Mundugumor marriages began in this violent fashion. If a married man wanted another man's wife or the daughter of another man, the pair must first elope. After eloping, the man had to defend his women against the enraged relatives and/or husband that would come to fight for her labor and fertility. After defending his new wife, the man was forced to compensate the girl's family for her position in the family. This compensation could be a kindred women or a valuable sacred flute. Polygyny The division of Mundugumor families can be attributed to the practice of polygyny. The Mundugumor had a form of organization called a \\"rope\\". A man's rope was composed of a man, his daughters', and his daughters' son's daughters. A female rope consisted of a woman, her sons, her sons' daughters, and her sons' daughters' sons. Sons were bound in allegiance to their mothers and daughters to their fathers. In Mundugumor culture, many wives was a symbol of wealth and power. Because of a man's desire to have a polygynous household, tension was created between fathers and sons in the form of competition and between husbands and wives in the form of jealousy. Traditionally, Mundugumor people were not permitted to marry outside of their generation, but none of their own rules were respected. Father's harbored a desire to have many young wives. This desire caused competition between fathers and sons for now they were competing for the same wives among the same families. At the same time, a mother favored her sons because a daughter can be used as an exchange for her husband to obtain another wife. As wives aged, they became less desirable and husbands look for younger wives. Because of this, a mother favors the exchange of her daughter for a son's wife rather than for a new wife for her husband. If an older wife objected to her husbands taking multiple wives, she was beaten for her defiance. Her son was expected to defend his mother and act violent towards the father, creating more tension in the home. Motherhood Beginning with pregnancy, Mundugumor women found motherhood a time of stress and inconvenience. When a woman gave her husband the news of her pregnancy he immediately became unhappy and is considered a marked man. He could no longer live a life as he did before and was officially known as a father. It was common for husbands to abuse their wives if they became pregnant early on in the marriage. He cursed the pregnancy magic that he conducted after intercourse to prevent pregnancy. There was also taboo against intercourse during pregnancy in fear of one child turning into twins, therefore women associated their pregnancy with sexual deprivation, as well as her husband's anger and repudiation, and the continual risk that he would take another wife and desert her. Before Birth Before the child was born, there was much contemplation over the fate of the child. Whether the child was to be kept and allowed the chance at life many times depends on whether the child is male or female. Though mothers many times wanted male children, the decision was weighted against her because the father and brothers preferred girls. Without female children, the boys in the kin-group would have trouble when it came to exchange for a wife. Boys had a greater chance of being kept alive as the birth order increased. If the first child was a boy, they had the poorest chances of living. If a wife became pregnant, and the husband did not believe that he had had enough sexual experience with his wife for the child to be his, the child had little chance of survival, regardless of the gender. The husband not only desired the death of this child, but also shamed and abused the wife to the extent that she too wished to have the child killed. If the couple chose against preserving the life of their child, Mundugumor practiced infanticide. Their most commonly chosen pathway was throwing the recently born infant into the Yuat River. The infant could still be alive, doomed to drowning, or strangled to death before it was disposed of in the river. After Birth Unlike in western civilization, children of the Mundugumor tribe were not welcomed to earth with warmth and love. Instead, babies were seen as a hassle until they could fend for themselves. Mothers were the primary caregivers for their children and continued with their daily routines shortly after childbirth. In fact, a father rarely even held his children. Mothers were expected to do the feeding, caring for, and weaning of their children. Despite the load this responsibility may bring, Mundugumor mothers took it in stride and expected their children to mature extremely quickly. Women comforted their children with food as an attempt to stop their wailing and only tended to the needs of the child during feeding. Women breast fed their children standing up, supporting their child with one hand in a position that was straining to the mothers arm and pinions the arms of the baby. The child was given no comfort as it gained its nutrition and the Mundugumor ensured no sensuous pleasure in feeding. The child was forbidden from prolonging his meal in any way, including playful fondling of his mother's body or his own. To Mundugumor women, the point of feeding their child was for him or her to absorb enough food to stop crying and allow the mother to place the child back in their basket. This hurried sense of what seems to be the only form of comfort provided by mothers was what caused the first signs of violence and competition in a Mundugumor individual. Because there was always a risk of being refused feeding, babies developed a fighting attitude while being nursed, holding on firmly to the mother's nipple and sucking milk as fast as possible. This harried notion of feeding caused many babies to choke from swallowing too fast. This choking irritated the mother and angered the child as they failed to accomplish their goal of satisfaction. Because of this, feeding became a situation of anger and struggle instead of reassurance and affection. From the moment children could walk, they were expected to fend for themselves. Aside from feeding, children were taught to act individually early on. Once a child was around one or two years old, they were carried around on the mother's back. Early in the child's life, mothers will, despite the well known risk of strangulation, carry their babies by the armpit. As children grew older and could hold on for themselves, mothers would sit their children astride the mother's neck and expect them to hold onto their mother's hair for support. Once astride the neck, mothers returned to working in the fields to provide for their families. Babies were rarely held, and if they were held it was not by the mothers but instead by small daughters of other mothers. Mundugumor mothers did not conform to the warm and comforting personalities that mothers in western civilizations adopt. Instead, they laughed at the fears of their children, punished them for crying during injury or discomfort, and joined along in the teasing done by other, older children. Before the Mundugumor tribe was placed under Australian governmental control, they even had the custom of giving their own children as hostages to temporary trade allies. They would leave their children, usually sons due to their lack of value, to prove their trust and reliability. This tradition proves the lack to connection and value of children to the Mundugumor people in general.

Trout began her aviation career at the age of 16; however, her first solo flight and solo certificate was only given on April 30, 1928.Warren K. Deem , Evelyn Trout Biography, 1999. Accessed online 8 March 2010. In the spring of 1928, Trout’s mother bought her an International K-6 biplane. Trout received her pilot's identification card from the United States Department of Commerce on September 1, 1928. She was the second woman to break the non-refueling endurance record for women when she flew 12 hours straight from California in 1929. The record was previously held by Viola Gentry and was the first record where Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) rules of the endurance record were revised stating endurance records had to be broken by a full hour. Trout also participated in the Women's Air Derby of 1929, which was dubbed the Powder Puff Derby. In 2001, she was recognized as the only living participant in the first Women's Air Derby of 1929. Evelyn got her nickname “Bobbi” when she copied the hairstyle of 1928 actress Irene Castle which was a short “Bob” haircut.Joe Godfrey , “Profile, Bobbi Trout”, October 27, 1999. Accessed online 08 March 2010 Early life Bobbi Trout was born on January 7, 1906 to Lola Trout and George Trout in Greenup, Illinois. One afternoon in 1918, Trout heard an aeroplane fly overhead. This incident started her interest in the field of aviation. Trout moved from Illinois to California with her family in 1920, when they purchased a service station. One day while tending the family business, Trout told her dreams to one of their patrons, W.E. Thomas, who coincidentally owned a Curtiss JN-4. Thomas asked Trout if she wanted a ride on the aircraft, which she did on December 27, 1922, taking off from Rogers Airport located in west Los Angeles. Trout saved approximately $2,500 which she used to enter Burdett Fuller’s flying school (the Burdett Airlines, Inc., School of Aviation) on January 1, 1928. In one of her flight lessons, she was instructed by a young pilot to three-quarter turn at low altitude, which resulted in the biplane spinning out of control. The resulting crash wrecked the plane completely. This accident did not deter Trout from flying, and she completed her first solo flight on April 30, 1928 and received her solo certificate. Aviation career After getting her license, Trout flew a Golden Eagle at the Metropolitan Airport in Los Angeles as an official dedication on December 14, 1928. Trout followed this up on January 2, 1929, flying from the same airport for 12 hours 11 minutes, shattering the previous record, held by Viola Gentry, by more than 4 hours. This record was short lived, as aviator Elinor Smith broke the record once again on January 30, 1929.Phyllis R. Moses, The Amazing Aviatrix Elinor Smith, Woman Pilot, March 30, 2008. Accessed online 15 December 2008. Smith flew 13 and a half hours straight from Mitchel Field using an open cockpit Bruner Winkle biplane. Determined to take back the record, Trout flew from Mines Field on February 10, 1929, returning this time after more than 17 hours. This flight also broke the record for the first all-night flight by a woman as well as the new women's solo endurance record.Di Freeze , Remembering Bobbi Evelyn Trout, March 2003. Accessed online 08 March 2010 In the same year on June 16, Trout flew a 90 horse power Golden Eagle Chief to an altitude of 15,200 feet breaking the light class aircraft altitude record. Modifying the same aircraft to use a 100 horse power engine, Trout flew from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California to the first Women's Transcontinental Air Derby together with other women aviators including Amelia Earhart. During the 8 day course, they experienced difficulties navigating through the road maps, Trout, Earhart, Gentry and the other ladies managed to communicate under such circumstances this led to the development of the Ninety-Nines: International Organization of Women Pilots. In order to get more sponsorship, Trout asked starlet Edna Mae Cooper if she wanted to go with her to attempt another endurance run. They first attempted the flight on January 1, 1931 but due to technical problems they had to abort the flight. At their next attempt, they were successful in flying straight for 122 hours and 50 minutes, only to end the run on January 9, 1931 due to the spitting off fuel. This was another record broken by Trout, and was later recognized by King Carol II of Romania, who representative gave her the Royal Decree and the aviation cross for pilots who made record flights, a distinction only given to two other pilots - Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh. Later life Trout celebrated her 80th birthday while being interviewed inside a helicopter over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California on January 7, 1986. On May of that same year she was honored during the Gathering of Eagles Program at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1999, she was also recognized as the only living participant from the first Women's Air Derby of 1929. Trout retired to San Diego, California and suffered a fatal heart attack on January 24, 2003. She never married and is survived by her sister-in-law Hazel Trout and her nephew Brook Trout.

Kirk Alexander Carnegie Kirk (16 July 1830 – 5 October 1892) was a Scottish engineer responsible for several major innovations in the shipbuilding, refrigeration, and oil shale industries of the 19th century. Kirk, born in Barry, Angus, received his formal education at the University of Edinburgh and a technical education at plants operated by Robert Napier and Sons. Family Alexander Carnegie Kirk was the eldest son of John Kirk (died 1858) and Christian Guthrie, née Carnegie, (died 1865). The naturalist John Kirk was his younger brother. A.C. Kirk married Ada Waller at Croydon in 1869 and they had six children. Career Kirk's retort In 1850, Kirk began a five-year apprenticeship with Robert Napier and Sons. In 1861, he became chief draughtsman at Maudslay, Sons and Field in London but this seems to have lasted less than a year. Later in 1861 he became an engineering manager in the shale-oil industry, working for James Young. During this employment he developed an oil shale retort and a refrigeration technology, involving the delivery of ether. The latter was to address production problems stemming from summer heat. In 1865 he joined the management of James Aitken and Company, an engine works in Glasgow. In 1870 he was appointed manager of the John C. Elder engineering works. After returning to the Napier firm as a senior partner in 1877, his work was thereafter focused on marine engineering. His triple- expansion engines as designed for the steamship Propontis were unsuccessful, but his subsequent versions of the engine design, particularly those designed for the steamship Aberdeen, are credited as technological breakthroughs. Professional appointments He served as the President of The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland from 1887 to 1889.

The dance is traditionally performed by dancers moving just the top halves of their bodies and accompanied by songs and tambourine-like drums. History The origins of tufo are unclear, although on the Island of Mozambique, legend has it that the dance began at the time when the prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina. He was welcomed by his followers with songs and dances praising Allah, accompanied by tambourines. Since the prophet approved of these dances, they continued to be performed at religious festivals. Tufo probably arrived in Mozambique in the 1930s, brought by a tradesman from Kilwa called Yussuf. The name probably derives from an Arabic name for the tambourines used in the dance, ad-duff. This word became adufe or adufo in Portuguese, and then tufo. The dance has also been heavily influenced by the matrilineal Makhuwa culture. Despite its Muslim origins, tufo has spread beyond the communities and context of Islam. Although still performed at religious feasts, tufo songs may also contain social or political themes. Performance Historically tufo was performed by both male and female dancers but now men usually only dance on rare occasions. Tufo dance groups comprise 15–20 women and are accompanied by four men or women on flat tambourine-like drums. All of the dancers sing although there are usually lead singers. Traditionally, tufo dancers danced while kneeling down, rhythmically moving the top halves of their bodies. More recently tufo choreography has evolved such dancers may stand and move their whole bodies about. Tufo songs are transmitted orally and may be composed by one of the dancer's or by the group's poet. They are usually in the Emakhuwa language but may also be in Arabic or Portuguese. The dancers must wear matching scarves and capulanas, which are a kind of sarong made from brightly coloured printed cloth. Each dance requires a new capulana to be worn.

History  In 1857, Alfred and Emma Jones opened a footwear shop in Bayswater, London. Jones was a pioneer in the installation of electric lighting in retail premises. Nine of their eleven sons became apprentices and subsequently store owners, trading as A. Jones and sons. A company innovation was the supply of ready made shoes in three widths. After the Second World War, the company expanded, with a warehouse in Eastbourne, the modernisation of existing stores, and the opening of new branches. The growth in Jones' retail outlets outstripped production at their factory; in 1955, the company became a member of the group Church's. A 'City Bootmaker' shop was opened in Manchester in 1994, and in 1996, the company began trading as Jones Bootmaker. After the acquisition of Church's by Prada, Jones Bootmaker was sold to a private investor in 2001, and then in 2006 to a financial consortium. It was sold in 2010 to the Macintosh Retail Group, and again in 2015 to Alteri Investors, back by Apollo Global Management. Alteri filed an intention to appoint administrators for Jones on 15 March 2017, and the company was purchased in a pre pack administration deal by Endless LLP on 26 March 2017, which saved seventy two of the stores. The chain was purchased from Endless by Pavers Shoes in February 2018.

Biography Born in Xanten on 27 March 1828), Bleibtreu was a painter, lithographer, designer and 'graveur sur bois'. He was a member of the Berlin Academy, receiving two gold medals for his works; he also received a medal at Vienna in 1873. Like many history painters of the 19th century, he studied at the Düsseldorf Academy between 1843 and 1848, and also with the historical and military painter, Theodore Hildebrandt. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. In 1858 he moved to Berlin. His reputation was built on large canvasses depicting the Prussian and German armies in battle, and he painted numerous scenes of the Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War. The background work to these paintings was done in the field as the artist accompanied the armies; in 1866, he traveled in the suite of Prince Frederick Charles until August when he returned to Berlin with a portfolio of sketches taken at the front. In 1870, he accompanied the Crown Prince. Following the successful war against Denmark, the Prussian king invited artists in December 1864 to compete for a prize of 10,000 thaler by painting a large canvas representing the victory at Düppel, the winning piece to by sent to the National Gallery in Berlin.Harrington, Peter, \\"German artists at war, 1864-1871 (1)\\", Military Illustrated No. 41, October 1991, pp. 27-28. One of the requirements was that artists had to be familiar with the subject and had experienced the war. Bleibtreu's piece was bought by the king in 1865, and the latter also commissioned the artist to paint the Crossing of the Alsen. Bleibtreu's Battle of Königgrätz, oil on canvas, 1866, Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin His painting of the Battle of Königgrätz depicted King William on a black horse with his suite, Bismarck, Moltke, Roon, and others, watching the battle; in the foreground is a detachment of captured Austrians. This style pervaded many of Bleibtreu's works where the focus was on the commander, who was often a member of the German royal family, surrounded by his soldiers in battle; this was often because the painting was a commission from the personage depicted. Shortly after the end of the war with France, he set up a studio in a quiet wing of the Palace of Versailles to commence work on two paintings, one representing the Crown Prince of Prussia at Wörth, and the other, King William at Battle of Sedan. In 1876, he exhibited two Franco-Prussian war scenes at the Royal Academy in Berlin. Bleibtreu died at Charlottenbourg on 16 October 1892. His work is rarely seen today, and some of his paintings were destroyed in World War II, although pictures of his works can be seen in histories of the various German wars, and regimental histories. He was the father of the literary critic Karl Bleibtreu.

It is located west of Claysburg, Pennsylvania. It was closed in 1961 due to budget constraints. The unit was eventually moved to Gibbsboro Air Force Station (RP-63), New Jersey. History Claysburg Air Force Station was part of the last batch of twenty- three radar stations constructed as part of the Air Defense Command permanent network. It was activated in April 1952, replacing the Connelsville L-16 Lashup site. It was declared completely operational in late 1952. The 772d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations with an AN/CPS-4 height-finder radar and AN/FPS-3 search radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1956, an AN/FPS-4 replaced the AN/CPS-4 and two years later an AN/FPS-20 replaced the original AN/FPS-3 search radar. During 1959 Claysburg AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-03 at Syracuse AFS, New York. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 772d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 February 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. This site was closed in 1961 and the 772d Radar Squadron was repositioned to an existing Army Nike Missile site at Pedricktown, NJ, which became Gibbsboro AFS, New Jersey in order to save money by combining Army and Air Force radar sites.Pedricktown Army Installation.

The battle took place near Léva, Kingdom of Hungary and was a Habsburg victory. The battle At the beginning of 1664, the Imperial Army was divided into 3 corps: In the south 17.000 Hungarian-Croatian troops under command of Miklós Zrínyi. In the center the main army of Raimondo Montecuccoli of 28,500 men, which had to stop the 100,000-man-strong army of Grand vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed. The third corps were the 8,500 men under general Louis Raduit de Souches in the North. Souches' army first conquered Nyitra on May 3 and then defeated the Ottomans under Mehmet Küçük on May 16 near Zsarnóca (Scharnowitz). An Ottoman relief army under Ali Pasha was sent from Buda to halt the imperial army near Léva. But this Ottoman army, composed mainly of irregular troops, was no match for the well-organized imperial battalions of musketeers, protected by their phalanx of pikemen. At first, de Souches hid a part of his troops to provoke an Ottoman attack. When they walked into the trap and then discovered the rest of the enemy's army, the irregular Ottoman troops panicked and fled, leaving many dead and a rich booty of carts and weaponry on the battlefield, including 11 large artillery pieces. The commander, Ali Pacha, was killed during the rout. This victory was strategically important, especially with possibility of burning the bridge over the Danube at Párkány (Gockern), thus isolating Upper Hungary from any further Turkish incursions. But eventually nothing came of it when, after even greater victory in the Battle of Saint Gotthard, Emperor Leopold I - to the outrage of Hungarian nobility - signed the unfavorable Peace of Vasvár.

Description It is an annual, typically found in nutrient-poor ground. It develops a large taproot. The plant is erect and covered with wool-like hairs. The ash-green leaves are alternate. The tiny monecious flowers are grouped in a raceme. The lower, female flowers lack petals and the upper male flowers have five small yellow petals. Pollination is by ants. The fruits are conspicuous and consist of three dark green conjoined spheres. Their surface is decorated with white scales and warty structures. Each sphere contains three seeds, which are propelled away from the plant by the mechanical force of the mature fruit twisting as it opens. Use for dye Chrozophora tinctoria produced the blue-purple colorant \\"turnsole\\" (also known as katasol or folium ) used in medieval illuminated manuscripts and as a food colorant in Dutch cheese and certain liquors.Chrozophora, Folium cloth The colour comes from the plant's fruit, specifically its dry outer coat. In 2020, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from FCT NOVA, University of Porto and University of Aveiro, identified the complex chemical structure of the medieval purple-blue dye extracted from the fruits of Chrozophora tinctoria. The chemical structure of the medieval dye was a mystery until now. The extracts obtained showed a novel blue chemical, chrozophoridine as the main chromophore.

Located along a tributary of Wheeling Creek in northern Richhill Township, it was once occupied by a Monongahela village. It has been ranked as one of southwestern Pennsylvania's most important locations for prehistoric preservation. Location The Fisher Site lies in the floodplain of the Enlow Fork, occupying a relatively rare clearing in the predominantly wooded hills of northern Greene County. Wooded lands around the site and along the Enlow Fork are part of State Game Lands 302, a public hunting and fishing preserve.DeLorme. Pennsylvania Atlas & Gazetteer. 8th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2003, 84. . Profile Testing has revealed that the village was part of the Drew Phase of the Monongahela; it was the tenth Drew site to be identified. The location of the Fisher Site in bottomland distinguishes it from all previously-known Drew sites and most other Monongahela villages; due to the frequent warfare among the Monongahela, their villages were typically built on hilltops.George, Richard L. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Deffenbaugh Site (36FA57). National Park Service, 1981-07-31. Excavations Although property owners had collected surface artifacts at the site since at least the early 1940s, the Fisher Site was first observed in 1962 during testing to reveal natural gas wells in the area. Fourteen years passed before an archaeological investigation was conducted at the site; testing conducted by this investigation revealed it to be a Late Woodland village site. A third excavation, carried out much more meticulously than either of the others, was completed shortly before 1981. Nearly 1,100 artifacts were recovered from the test pits of the third excavation, including animal bones, stone tools, and over 500 potsherds of various styles. Among the potsherds were pieces decorated with unusual geometric designs; no other site is known to have produced pottery with these designs. Preservation Intensive industrialization in the river valleys of southwestern Pennsylvania has likely destroyed most of the region's Monongahela sites originally located in floodplains. Moreover, it is possible that many unknown sites have been destroyed during the process of surface mining for coal in the region. In contrast to this common situation, the Enlow Fork in the vicinity of the Fisher Site is quite undeveloped; only small roads traverse the region, and — unlike in southern Richhill Township — no gas wells operate nearby. The pristine condition of the site and the likelihood that it will yield information about the little-known Drew Phase has led it to be assessed as highly worthy of preservation. In accordance with this goal, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

However, the Marine Corps asked the Seabees if they could come up with an idea to get over the coral. Commodore Paul J.

They mounted steel beams salvaged from Saipan's abandoned sugar mill on LVT-2s to create a portable assault ramps. If they worked they would allow the Marines to outflank Tinian's prepared defenses.

The society aimed at using drawing as a means of developing these characteristics of children. It promoted the teaching of drawing in schools. Lord Leighton, Sir John Millais, and Sir Edward Burne-Jones aided in the society's activities. The society awarded the first annual scholarship in 1892 to a Miss F M Price.

Popular culture historian Ron Goulart calls him \\"one of the truly wacky creations of comics.\\" Publication history Doctor Hormone first appeared in Popular Comics #54 (Aug 1940), and his adventures ran until issue #60 (Feb 1941). Fictional character biography Doctor Hormone was an elderly scientist who, having discovered the secret of life itself, injected himself with a \\"youth hormone\\" which restored his body to youthful vigor. After agents from Urasia stole his formulas from his laboratory to aid in their nation's wars against its neighbors, Doctor Hormone and his granddaughter Jane traveled to the besieged nation of Novoslavia, where he used his scientific expertise to help battle the Urasian invaders, who were using the hormones to create armies of part animal/part human men. Later, Doctor Hormone was employed as a researcher for the United States Army and worked in a laboratory at Fort Knox. Doctor Hormone was later summoned by a disembodied voice called the Thinker who temporarily endowed him with superhuman powers to fight off an invasion of Texas by the Nazians. Towards the end of his run, Doctor Hormone discovered that the Ku Klux Klan were acting as a fifth column for the Nazians. He and Jane were tied to burning crosses, but they were freed by the Five Fleamen. In the final chapter, the Thinker brought Hormone and Jane to his headquarters, in the primordial chaos. They fell into a state of suspended animation, and were never seen again. Powers and abilities Doctor Hormone was a scientific genius who developed powerful \\"hormones\\" which were capable of creating great changes in the human body, including restoring youth and transforming people into animals or bizarre human-animal hybrids. The Thinker endowed Doctor Hormone with powers that included superhuman strength, a stentorian voice, and super-breath.

Visitors are invited to walk in the grounds and gardens, and there are guided tours of the house. Shankill CastleShankill Castle started as a Butler tower-house near the ruins of an old church. Peter Aylward bought the lands from his wife's family, the Butlers, in 1708, and it was rebuilt and set in a formal landscape with a vista to the front and canal to the rear. In the 19th century, it was enlarged and castellated, serpentine bays added to the canal, and an unusual polyhedral sundial given a place of pride on a sunken lawn. Other additions were a gothic porch bearing the Aylward crest and a conservatory. The stable-yard and the castellated entrance to the demesne are attributed to Daniel Robertson. The interior preserves much of its 18th-century character and features including a Georgian staircase, Gothic plasterwork, and a Victorian drawing-room. A branch of the Butler family, the Toler-Aylwards resided at Shankill until 1991 and some still live in the area of Kilkenny. Shankill is now home to the artist Elizabeth Cope and her husband Geoffrey. They have three children Phoebe Cope McCosh, Reuben Cope, and Sybil Cope. Shankill Castle hosts a residency programme for artists and creative professionals through ResArtis.  Garden  In the garden, there are remnants of 18th-century lime alles, 19th-century laurel lawns. There are some Victorian favourites such as the now gigantic sequoias and 20th-century, self-sown ash trees. The moated garden, once a rose garden then forgotten and planted with Sitka spruces is now a spring garden, and the graveyard blooms all year round.

They sought outside assistance and by 1939 the plans were ready and building cameras commenced at a very slow rate. The camera was eventually named the Alpa because it was light, pocketable, and might easily be brought along travelling in the Alps. The Alpa-Reflex is only predated by the Kine Exakta, the Sport, and the Praktiflex 35mm SLRs. The manufacturer was Pignons S.A, Ballaigues, and the designer was Jacques Bolsky born December 31, 1895 in Kiev as Yakob Bogopolsky. He emigrated to the United States of America once the design was completed. He was also the inventor of the renowned Bolsey and Bolex cine cameras. Camera production Viteflex Pignons S.A. never aimed at producing cameras in large quantities, but rather at quality and they often made cameras to special order, incorporating features as requested by the customer. Lenses were subcontracted to several well-known manufactures. Prototype production began in 1939. A test series of 20 cameras was completed by 1941, the series A, starting at serial number 10.001. Some of these were called BOLCA Reflex, some TELEFLEX and some VITEFLEX. In 1942 a small production series B starting at serial number 11.000 was completed for local sale, but no record of it exists at the factory. By now, the Alpa trademark had been chosen and the camera became the Alpa-Reflex. The camera was first presented for a wider public in April 1944 at the Swiss Trade Fair in Basel (Schweizer Mustermesse), and soon production began in earnest with the series C, albeit at a very slow rate: 115 was made in 1944 and 434 in 1945. In addition to the SLR camera, a few rangefinder cameras were produced, the Standard, that lacks the reflex finder. By accident, the series C has a six- digit serial number, starting at 120.001. The series D began in 1945 at serial number 13.000, the factory now reverting to the five-digit format. Some 1.350 cameras were produced during a two-year period, ending in 1947 at serial number 15.020, the serial number range including all models and types manufactured. The series E was the last series of the original Alpa-Reflex; it begins at 20.000 with only minor improvements. It ends at 25.032 in 1951. In 1949, the Alpa Prisma-Reflex was introduced, sporting a pentaprism finder, which was a new feature in 35mm SLR cameras about this time; also seen a year before on the Rectaflex from Rome, Italy, and the Contax S from Zeiss Ikon in Dresden. Production of this first generation ALPA-Reflex and the ALPA Prisma- Reflex cameras continued smoothly until 1952, at which point the factory had made some 5.000 more cameras. In 1952, Pignons S.A introduced a new range of cameras, employing completely new production techniques.No ISBN available.

The gallery was damaged during World War II and repairing this damaged delayed its reopening until 1946. The gallery's art collection covers six centuries of European art history, with over 5,300 works in its fine art collection. It is housed in an example of 1930s municipal architecture. The gallery holds a Designated Collection, considered of national importance.Southampton City Art Gallery, Culture 24, UK. Highlights of the permanent collection include a 14th-century altarpiece by Allegretto Nuzi, of the Italian Giambattista Pittoni; the Perseus series by Burne-Jones; paintings by the Camden Town Group and The London Group; sculpture by Jacob Epstein, Auguste Rodin, Edgar Degas, Henri Gaudier Brzeska, Richard Deacon and Tony Cragg; and Richard Long photographs. Thousands of visitors explore the exhibitions and displays every month and, through a programme of educational activities, Southampton City Art Gallery provides opportunities for greater access, involvement and understanding of art for people of all ages. The gallery's educational service works closely with a range of professional visual artists, including Melanie Rose, Debra Marsh, Jo Bresloff and Alastair Eales.

The Oregon Trail passed through this location, where the covered wagons had to maneuver downhill from La Grande. Most emigrants camped at Hilgard before continuing back uphill towards Emigrant Springs or Meacham. Hilgard was named for both Eugene W. Hilgard, dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, and for Henry Villard, whose name prior to immigrating to the United States was Ferdinand Heinrich Gustav Hilgard. Villard was Hilgard's cousin, and when he built the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company railroad line over the Blue Mountains, he enlisted Hilgard to make an agricultural survey of the area. In July 1883, a post office named \\"Dan\\" was established. The name was changed to \\"Hilgard\\" in August of that year when the well-known Eugene Hilgard was in the Pacific Northwest.

RPS is being developed in response to performance goals that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to achieve by 2012, as outlined in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). In addition to the U.S., regulatory agencies from Europe, Canada, and Japan are at varying levels of interest and participation. Currently, the second release of RPS is in development. Goal of RPS Authorities such as the FDA receive numerous submissions that address a variety of regulatory issues. The information contained in these submissions is divided into large numbers of files, both paper and electronic. Often, files in one submission are related to files in earlier submissions. Because the information is divided into numerous files sent over time, it can be difficult to efficiently process and review the information. While the general data layouts of all regulated products are the same, different product types have different lists of topics that must be addressed within the submission. Therefore, the goal of RPS is to create an HL7 XML message standard for submitting information to regulatory authorities. Each message includes the contents of a regulatory submission plus information such as metadata, which is necessary to process submissions. The Refined Message Information Model (R-MIM) shows the structure of a message as a color- coded diagram. R-MIM diagrams are designed to capture all required information for the efficient processing and review of regulatory submissions and to explain what each message consists of. This makes RPS general enough to handle all regulated products while containing enough information to allow regulators to support structured review. Origins The project to develop a regulated product submission standard was initiated on June 22, 2005. Release 1 was spearheaded by Jason Rock of GlobalSubmit, with the aim of creating one standardized submission format to support all of the FDA's electronic product submissions. The Health Level 7 message was created by leveraging existing human pharmaceutical experience, such as The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). RPS Release 1 provides the capability to cross-reference previously submitted material owned by the sponsor as well as append, replace and delete parts of the document lifecycle. Release 2, led by Peggy Leizear of the Office of Planning at the FDA, grants the ability to exchange contact information, classify submission content and handle multi-region submissions. The second release of RPS also handles two-way communication—The regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) will use RPS to send correspondence (e.g. request for additional information, meeting minutes, application approval) to the submitter. RPS structure As the industry moves away from paper submissions, global companies producing regulated products will benefit from having a published electronic submission standard. The label of “regulated product” applies not only to pharmaceuticals, but also extends to include food additives, medical devices and radiologics, human therapeutics, biologics, tobacco products and veterinary products. The submitted information is structured as a collection of documents, organized by report sections. Multiple documents can be assigned to a single report section. The actual table of required and optional report sections varies from product to product and is defined by regulatory authorities. Since the same information can be submitted to support multiple applications, it is imperative that RPS allow for the reuse of data between applications. RPS and eCTD RPS is in many ways comparable to the electronic Common Technical Document. Ideally, the FDA would like to implement RPS as the next iteration of eCTD. The idea behind RPS and ICH’s eCTD is the same—the use of a standardized format for regulatory submissions, including PDF documents and SAS datasets. Although document contents are the same for eCTD and RPS, the internal XML structures are very different. RPS will offer two obvious advantages over eCTD. First, RPS will establish two-way communication between the submitter and all FDA-regulated product centers within the agency. Second, RPS will manage the life cycle of submissions by allowing cross-referencing of previously submitted information. This means that for electronic Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, New Drug Applications (NDA), and Biologic License Applications (BLAs), information need only be submitted once and previously submitted electronic documents can be applied to marketing applications. With RPS, archived electronic IND, NDA, and BLA submissions will be retrievable through standardized automated links. eCTD lacks this cross-referencing capability. Future releases and implementation Release 3 will be headed by ICH. The goal of release three is to have more international requirements. The HL7 standard will be implemented first at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in late 2011, before being rolled out to the other centers using a yet-to-be- determined schedule. Both centers will implement Release 2 of RPS, which barely passed ballot as a Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU) in January 2010. The ballot passed by two votes with a result of 53 affirmative and 33 negative. Testing by FDA is expected to begin at the beginning of the third quarter, 2010. When RPS is implemented, FDA will offer a training program for reviewers, including hands-on training classes.

Hänninen's design projects ranged from furniture to trams and church silverware, including total interior designs for many public facilities. His modernist designs also included tables and chairs, and he was well recognized for his work on the Palace Hotel interiors together with Antti Nurmesniemi and Olli Borg. Hänninen designed a renowned plastic chair with metal structure for the hotel's cafe. In the 1970s his designs included the new Valmet Nr I trams for Helsinki City Transport. Before starting his own design office in 1961, Hänninen worked at architect Viljo Revell's offices in the early 1950s, where one of his tasks was to design selected interiors for the Palace Hotel building completed in 1952. In 1957, Hänninen received a gold medal at the 11th Milan Triennale for his design of a dwelling exhibition in the Finnish Pavilion. In 1977 he received the State of Finland Award for Industrial Design. He was also an honorary member of the Finnish Association of Interior Architects. A book on Hänninen's life work, consisting of articles written by six Finnish experts on arts and design, was published in 2006.

In 1952 he returned to living with Christiane Motoret, which he did until her death in May 1972. Together they had one daughter, Laurence Motoret. While writing and diligently studying at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, (especially documents concerning the anarchist Jules Durand, to whom he devoted an unpublished novel), he temporarily worked as a college supervisor, a night watchman in a warehouse, a sailing, tennis or ping-pong instructor and many other jobs. Emile Danoën died in its 80th year Meudon, where he lived with a friend of his youth. He married his fourth wife, Francine Bloch, in 1984. Some of his works were translated into English, Russian and Chinese.

He attended the Georgia Institute of Technology before transferring to the University of Alabama. Peek signed a free agent contract after going undrafted, due to an injury at the NFL Combine, in the 2010 NFL draft. He was part of the Crimson Tide in the 2010 BCS National Championship. High school career A Florida native, Peek attended The Bolles School where he played on three consecutive state championship teams. Coming out of high school, he was rated as a Top 30 tight end by both Scout.com (No. 23) and Rivals.com (No. 27). He chose to play at Georgia Tech for coach Chan Gailey before leaving to become the starting tight end for The University of Alabama under Nick Saban. College career=Georgia Tech As a true freshman in 2005, Peek saw action in nine games for the Yellow Jackets. However, he failed to record any catches. In 2006, Chan Gailey decided to redshirt Peek. In 2007, Peek became a significant player for the Yellow Jackets. He started 11 out of 13 games and ranked third on the team with 25 receptions. He accumulated 248 yards and one touchdown. Season highlights for Peek included five receptions for 35 yards against Boston College, three receptions for 31 yard at Maryland, two receptions for 49 yards against Army, and three passes for 28 yards (including a 17-yard touchdown) against Georgia. Alabama Following the 2007 season, Chan Gailey was fired as Tech's head coach. When Paul Johnson was hired as the new coach for the Yellow Jackets, Peek knew his role in Johnson's triple option flexbone offense would be limited. He decided to transfer to Alabama who had just finished 7-6 in their first year under Nick Saban. Peek was forced to sit out the 2008 season due to the NCAA transfer rule. He was eligible to play in the 2009 Sugar Bowl, but he had to miss the game due to an injured foot. In 2009, Peek was a member of Alabama's first national championship team in 17 years. Peek recorded 26 receptions for 313 yards throughout the season. Three of Peek's receptions resulted in touchdowns. His third touchdown of the year came against Florida in the 2009 SEC Championship Game and was featured on the cover of the following week's Sports Illustrated issue. Peek caught at least one pass in 10 of 14 games. He did not record any catches in the 2010 BCS National Championship Game. NFL career After not being drafted, due to a previous injury discovered at the NFL combine, in the 2010 NFL Draft, Peek signed as a preferred free agent with the Atlanta Falcons. However, his agent later structured a medical release from the team during the 2010 season due to a playing-related injury.

He worked with all three subjects on university level, but is best remembered as Norway's first professor of psychology. He was born in Dypvåg as a son of bishop Kristian Schjelderup (1853–1913) and Hendy Hassel (1855–1922). He was a brother of Kristian Schjelderup Jr, he too a bishop. He finished his secondary education at Kristiansand Cathedral School in 1912, and graduated in physics from the Royal Frederick University. Here he also worked as research assistant of Lars Vegard. He also worked with anatomy, microscopy and philosophy. He released the paper Hovedlinjer i filosofiens utvikling fra midten av det 19. århundre til nutiden in 1916, and was hired as a research fellow in philosophy in 1917. In line with the tendency of the day, his philosophy was positivist and crossed into psychology. He studied experimental psychology in Copenhagen and Göttingen, and took the dr.philos. degree in 1919 with the thesis Til sansefornæmmelsernes psykofysiologi. He then studied in Berlin and Freiburg, and was appointed as a professor in 1922. After six years as a professor of philosophy, he became Norway's first professor of psychology in 1928. He worked at the Royal Frederick University (from 1939: the University of Oslo). Among other things, Schjelderup learned psychoanalysis. He helped persons like Otto Fenichel and Wilhelm Reich to migrate from Nazi Germany to Norway. Then, after Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Schjelderup became leader of the university's Aksjonsutvalget, a resistance committee. Open protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students. The staff Johannes Andenæs, Bjørn Føyn, Johan Christian Schreiner, Eiliv Skard, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Endre Berner and Harald K. Schjelderup were sent to Grini concentration camp. Schjelderup was first incarcerated at Bredtveit from 15 October to 22 November, then at Berg until 8 December, then at Grini until 5 May 1945. He also spent time at Victoria Terrasse under interrogation. After the war Schjelderup returned as professor, and helped build and consolidate the university's psychology studies. He became professor emeritus in 1965. Important books include Psykologi (1927), Über drei Haupttypen der religiösen Erlebnisformen (1932, written with his brother), Innføring i psykologi (1957) and Det skjulte menneske (1961). He was a board member of the International Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1922) and the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, and was decorated as a Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Olav (1961). He was married twice, and died in August 1974 in Oslo. A building at the University of Oslo, Harald Schjelderups hus, bears his name.

Being active since 1998, in which they have released two studio albums Tarde o Temprano (Sooner or Later) and lo que escribo sobre ti (what i write about you), Sonica is one of the most recognized bands for the Venezuelan public, having a large fan base.  Biographical summary  In 1998, Martín Imhof decided to start a punk band influenced by the sounds of the California punk, very popular bands like NOFX, The Offspring, Green Day, among others. With him in the drums, his sister María Imhof took the guitar. The band was complete when his friend Peruvian Gustavo Ramón joined in the lead guitar, Jean Carlo Calderón on vocals y Gilbert Lugo on bass. Their first years passed in the underground scene of Caracas. Their sound and their songs were really new for the bands in the country at that time, gradually adding fans and good critics. The original lineup would last several years, until 2005, when Gilbert Lugo and Nelson Porras left the band being replaced by Ricardo Sosa and Leonardo Borges. By this time, the band had recorded several video clips (El Niño-The Kid-, Perfecto-Perfect- and ¿Cuánto me Cuesta?-How much will it Cost?-) and had interviews and appearances for various magazines, TV and radio. With its new lineup they recorded the video for the song ¿Por Qué?-Why?-, which was highly acclaimed by fans, turning the song into one of the most popular of them. Their first album, Tarde o Temprano, were released in that year. The title refers the fact that it took 7 years to come up. The band's sound also changed, moving to a much happier punk playing sentimental themes like love and relationships. Since this time the band has a lot of detractors, criticizing their music as they thought that was too light and commercial, and therefore did not identify the ideology of punk. One year later, in 2006, the band would suffer another departure when JC Calderon left the band. Ricardo Sosa, lead guitar at that time, also took the vocals. For two years they did several shows, among which there were two being openers of foreign bands like the Mexicans Panda and Allison, and record what would become their second studio album, lo que escribo sobre ti, released in 2007. Again, the band has a change in his music, going from punk to the alternative rock. Also in this year they would give their first performances abroad, visiting Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina and represented Venezuela in the reality show on MTV Latinamerica, Rally MTV. In 2009, Ricardo Sosa and Leo Borges left the band. María and Martín, the only members of the original lineup that started in 1998, managed to complete the current line-up with Ivan Infante on guitar and Marco Ramos on bass and vocals. In a statement on its official facebook profile they announced their plans to launch a new video clip and a new album for 2010. They opened a concert in Caracas on July 18 (2011) for pop-punk singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, during her \\"The Black Star Tour\\".http://www.fmcenteresnoticia.com.ve/?p=51817  Members  *Iván Infante (Guitar) *Marco Ramos (Bass/Vocals) *Martín Imhof (Drums) *María Imhof (Guitar/Back vocals)  Discography  *Tarde o Temprano-Sooner or Later- (2005). *lo que escribo sobre ti-what i write about you- (2007). *Once-Eleven- (2011).

In 1386 the Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae (\\"the living water\\") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy, who previously had defeated Tatar-Mongols and their Genoese mercenaries in the remarkable large-scale Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. The Genoese likely got this beverage with the help of the alchemists of Provence, who used the Arab- invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol. Since Islam prohibited the drinking of any alcoholic beverages for Arabs, they used alcohol mainly for the production of perfumes. In Christian Europe, however, the aqua vitae became the predecessor of all modern strong alcoholic beverages, including brandy, whisky, schnapps and Russian vodka. The liquid that was obtained as a result of distillation of grape must was thought to be a concentrate and a \\"spirit\\" of wine (spiritus vini in Latin), from where came the name of this substance in many European languages (like English spirit, or Russian spirt). Moscow Chudov Monastery in 1883 According to a legend, around 1430 a monk called Isidore from Chudov Monastery inside the Moscow Kremlin made a recipe of the first Russian vodka. Having a special knowledge and distillation devices he became an author of the alcoholic beverage of a new, higher quality. This \\"bread wine\\" as it was initially known, was produced for a long time exclusively in the Grand Duchy of Moscow and in no other principality of Rus' (this situation persisted until the era of industrial production). That's why this beverage for a long time was associated with Moscow. Vodka is an augmentative from Russian voda (\\"water\\"). The first written usage of the word vodka in an official Russian document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of Empress Elizabeth of June 8, 1751, which regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries.

Biography  Singer, pianist, keyboards player and composer, Petrina is one of the revelations of Italian independent music scene, and synthesizes in a visionary style her oblique and sensual songwriting and the experimentations of avant- garde jazz-rock and electronics. Artist at 360 degrees, she goes from a solid preparation as a classical and contemporary pianist, with several premieres and recordings in the United States, to the use of electronics and keyboards, to the composition for different kinds of ensemble, to a unique use of voice and dance. Winner of several Italian Awards as a songwriter, Petrina has aroused the interest of David Byrne, whose webradio has hosted her songs many times, and of John Parish: they are both guests in her previous album Petrina (AlaBianca/Warner). Composers of the like of Sylvano Bussotti, Terry Riley and Frederic Rzewski have expressed great appreciation of her as a composer and a pianist. She has also had collaborations with Elliott Sharp, Mike Sarin and Jherek Bischoff. She has played world and European premières of pieces by Cage, Feldman, Maderna, Rota, Togni, Bussotti, and Katunda in places like the La Fenice Theatre in Venice, Mills College (Oakland) and the Conway Hall in London. She has performed her own music mainly in Europe and the U.S. She has recorded one CD and one DVD for the US label OgreOgress with all premiere recordings (Early and Unknown Piano Pieces by Morton Feldman and Morton Feldman-Barbara Monk Feldman), and has also participated in A Call for Silence, a recording project by Nicolas Collins for the Sonic Arts Network, UK. She is one of the four pianists of Four Pianos by Sylvano Bussotti, premiered in Italy in 2013 and subsequently published on a CD by Stradivarius. She is also a performer in a broader sense: she has danced in international projects of such choreographers as Iris Erez and Sara Wiktorowicz, and she has choreographed herself (her solo piece She-Shoe has been featured at the International Dance Film Festival 2008 in Yokohama, Japan). She has performed at the Venice Biennale 2013. She has also composed the choreography for Morton Feldman’s Three Dances, which she performs it in the double role of pianist and dancer. Her latest album for voice and piano, Roses of the Day (2015), has been produced by Paolo Fresu, one of Europe’s most respected jazz musicians, for his new label dedicated to voices, Tŭk Voice. The piece which gives the title to the album, Roses of the Day, is signed by Petrina and John Cage, and the score is available from Edition Peters. In the same album, her interpration of Only by Morton Feldman, for solo voice, has been included in Chris Villars' collection, and defined by him the best, most expressive performance: it seems to elevate the piece to something of greater significance.

It is located south-southeast of Gibbsboro, in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. It was closed in 1994 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) Ground Equipment Facility. History What would eventually become Gibbsboro AFS was established in March 1957 as an unmanned \\"Gap Filler\\" site, designated P-9A for Highlands Air Force Station, New Jersey, configured with an AN/FPS-14 radar. It was the first Gap Filler site in the nation. In 1960, the United States Army established Army Air Defense Command Post (AADCP) PH-64DC for Nike missile command-and-control functions at Pedrickstown Army Installation. The site was an AN/FSG-l Missile-Master Radar Direction Center. In a fund-saving consolidation, the Air Force moved the 772d Radar Squadron (SAGE) from Claysburg Air Force Station, Pennsylvania, to this Army long-range radar site, and inactivated the P-9A gap-filler radar. The Army site was transferred to the Air Force, and renamed Gibbsboro Air Force Station. The site was redesignated as RP-53 and began Air Force long-range radar operations on 1 May 1961 with AN/FPS-66 and AN/FPS-6 radars. The center initially fed data to the SAGE (DC-01) center at McGuire AFB. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-63. In addition, an AN/FPS-27 radar was installed in 1963, and the AN/FPS-66 was retired in 1964. In 1963 the site also used AN/FPS-6A and AN/FPS-26A height-finder radars. The site became an ADC/FAA joint-use facility around 1966. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 772nd Radar Squadron continued operating the AN/FPS-27 and AN/FPS-26A radars until 1983. The squadron was inactivated in 1984. However, an AN/FPS-117 became operational in 1986 under contractor support. This radar served as a prototype for units installed in Alaska. After shutdown in 1992, this radar was moved to Murphy Dome Air Force Station, Alaska. Radar coverage for the Philadelphia area was assumed by the FAA's site at Trevose, PA. Then, a portion of the Gibbsboro site was transferred to the FAA in 1995 for installation of an ARSR-4 set, and the Trevose site was shut down. Today what was Gibsboro AFS has largely been disassembled. The FAA Joint Surveillance System (JSS) radar radome and a few old Air Force buildings is about all that remains. Among those buildings, the old Gap Filler support building from 1957 still stands.

The global average temperature in the mid-Pliocene (3.3 Ma–3 Ma) was 2–3 °C higher than today, global sea level 25m higher and the northern hemisphere ice sheet was ephemeral before the onset of extensive glaciation over Greenland that occurred in the late Pliocene around 3 Ma. The formation of an Arctic ice cap is signaled by an abrupt shift in oxygen isotope ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean beds.Van Andel (1994), p. 226. Mid-latitude glaciation was probably underway before the end of the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannas. During the Pliocene the earth climate system response shifted from a period of high frequency-low amplitude oscillation dominated by the 41,000-year period of Earth's obliquity to one of low-frequency, high-amplitude oscillation dominated by the 100,000-year period of the orbital eccentricity characteristic of the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. The equatorial pacific ocean sea surface temperature gradient was considerably lower than it is today, mean sea surface temperature in the east were substantially warmer than today but similar in the west, this condition has been described as a permanent El Niño state or El Padre. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this pattern, including increased tropical cyclone activity. Setting During the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene Series of the Cenozoic Era, 3.6 to 2.2 Ma (million years ago), the Arctic was much warmer than it is at the present day (with summer temperatures from 3.6-3.4 Ma some 8 °C warmer than today). That is a key finding of research into a lake-sediment core obtained in Eastern Siberia, which is of exceptional importance because it has provided the longest continuous late Cenozoic land-based sedimentary record thus far.  Global cooling and Northern hemisphere glaciation onset  Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain global cooling after 3 Ma and the onset of extensive northern hemisphere glaciation. ;Panama seaway closure The closure of the Panama seaway (13 Ma–2.5 Ma) increased the salinity contrast between Pacific and Atlantic Ocean and the northward oceanic heat transport. Warmer water increased snowfall and possibly Greenland ice sheet volume. However, model simulations suggest reduced ice volume due to increased ablation at the edge of the ice sheet under warmer conditions. ;Collapse of permanent El Niño A permanent El Niño state existed in the early-mid Pliocene. Warmer temperature in the eastern equatorial pacific increased water vapor greenhouse effect and reduced the area covered by highly reflective stratus clouds thus decreasing the albedo of the planet. Propagation of El Niño effect through planetary waves may have warmed the polar region and delayed the onset of the northern hemisphere glaciation. Therefore, the appearance of cold surface water in the east equatorial pacific around 3 million years ago may have contributed to global cooling and modified global climate response to Milankovitch cycles. ;Uplift of the Rocky mountains and Greenland west coast Uplift of the Rocky mountains and Greenland west coast may have cooled the climate due to jet stream deflection and increased snowfall due to higher surface elevation. ; Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide concentration during the mid Pliocene has been estimated at around 400 ppmv from 13C/12C ratio in organic marine matter and stomatal density of fossilized leaves, decreasing carbon dioxide levels during late Pliocene may have contributed substantially to global cooling and the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation.  West Antarctic ice sheet  Mid-Pliocene reconstructed terrain and ice sheet elevation West Antarctic Ice Sheet extent oscillated at the 40Kyr period of Earth's obliquity, ice sheet collapse occurred when global average temperature were 3 °C warmer than today and carbon dioxide concentration 400 ppmv and resulted in open waters in the Ross Sea. Global sea-level fluctuation associated with ice-sheet collapse were probably of up to 7 meters for west Antarctic and 3 meters for east Antarctic. Model simulations are consistent with reconstructed ice-sheet oscillations and suggest a progression from smaller to larger west Antarctic ice sheet in the last 5 Million years, intervals of ice sheet collapse are much more common in the early-mid Pliocene (5 Ma – 3 Ma), after three-million-year intervals with modern or glacial ice volume became longer and collapse occurs only at times when warmer global temperature coincide with strong austral summer insolation anomalies.  Mid Pliocene and future climate  Pliocene biomes. The mid Pliocene warm period is considered a potential analog of future climate. The intensity of the sunlight reaching the earth, the global geography, and carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to present. Furthermore, many mid-Pliocene species are extant helping paleotemperature proxies calibration. Model simulations of mid-Pliocene climate produce warmer conditions at middle and high latitudes, as much as 10–20 °C warmer than today above 70°N. They also indicate little temperature variation in the tropics. Model-based biomes are generally consistent with Pliocene paleobotanical data indicating a northward shift of the Tundra and Taiga and an expansion of Savanna and warm-temperate forest in Africa and Australia.

He served as mayor of Ardmore, Oklahoma and of Oklahoma City, and as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. He is notable as the originator of the mineral transfer deed known as the Hefner Form, which is still used at present. Hefner was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1949. Dead link June 27, 2018 Hefner also became notable because of his contributions in public service, especially in Ardmore and later in Oklahoma City. Although his official title in Ardmore was mayor, locals soon gave him the honorary nickname, \\"The Judge,\\" apparently because he was so skillful in resolving disagreements and getting unlikely allies to support community actions, such as creating the city's water supply. In Oklahoma City, he would repeat this success on a much larger scale, initiating a municipal water supply system that still serves the much-expanded city at present. Early life Hefner was born on February 7, 1874 in the community of Hefner Chapel north of Lone Oak, Hunt County, Texas to William Lafayette Hefner and Sarah Jane Masters Hefner. Growing up in poverty, self-teaching was the only education Hefner could afford. By the age of 21, he had received only nine months of formal education, primarily from books received from a cousin at College Station which he read \\"at night while I was working on the farm and also when I was out herding sheep\\". In 1895, the family had to sell the farm to pay off debts, though the proceeds were insufficient to settle them in full. Just after Hefner's 21st birthday, his father died. Hefner then resolved to work the farm for the following year to clear the family debts. He received $15 per month credited against the debt, and studied at night under a kerosene lamp given to him by his father in the hope of passing the entrance exams for college. In 1896, Hefner passed the examination and gained entrance to North Texas Baptist College at Jacksboro.Minor, David. \\"North Texas Baptist College.\\" In Handbook of Texas Online. Texas State Historical Association. Accessed June 27, 2018. Hefner then taught school before entering the University of Texas Law School in 1899.Creel, Von R. \\"Hefner, Robert Alexander (1874-1971).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed June 27, 2018. He paid off the remaining family debts.Oklahoma City Times March 4, 1941 Hefner went to college with only the clothes on his back and 35 cents, but found work splitting wood to pay his way. At Jacksboro, he met his wife, Eva Johnson, daughter of a banker. She spoke four languages fluently and became valedictorian of Baylor University in 1905, after gaining her third degree. On graduation, he decided he would study law at the University of Texas in Austin, but once again found funding to be a problem. As a result, he worked for a while to save up enough to pay his way and, at the age of 25, he enrolled at the University of Texas and found himself only the second student from the \\"South Prairie\\" to do so. His hard work was rewarded in 1902 when he graduated near the top of his law class. The philosophy of hard work, which he taught to his children as \\"hit the ball hard\\", didn't always pay off. When he tried to take up golfing to be able to spend more time with his son, Hefner swung so hard at the ball that he broke two ribs, ending his golfing career on his first swing. The boom Following his graduation, Hefner headed to Beaumont. It seemed all Texas had heard of the Hamill brothers' gusher which gained Beaumont the title \\"Oil Capital of the World\\" for a short time. Hefner decided to specialize in oil and gas law, and to save his money to invest in land that one day might produce. He found a partner, and opened Parker and Hefner. They landed the Southern Pacific Railroad account for their division just seven years after Hefner arrived in Austin. The workload was so great that they had to hire a third partner, renaming the firm Parker, Hefner and Organ. Throughout his time in Beaumont, Hefner was educating himself further in the oil and gas industry--he became fascinated with geology (or \\"creekology\\" as he called it.) It was also during this time that Eva graduated from Baylor University and the two were married on July 18, 1906. They decided to move to Ardmore, Oklahoma after being involved in a Choctaw court case which dealt specifically with the Dawes Act and Indian mineral conveyances to non-Indians. The account states that Hefner worked for four Indian families, helping them to get their land allotment. He was paid for this work with an annual interest in future profits from the mineral rights, making Hefner quite wealthy.\\"\\"Hefner Family History in the Energy Business.\\" GHK Companies. 2016. Accessed June 27, 2018. Although it is not clear when Hefner actually moved to Ardmore with his family, he had become a resident of Ardmore by January 1, 1908. He founded the Hefner Company, and became an expert in legal issues related to the rapidly-developing oil and gas industry. He immersed himself in community affairs and was made president of the local school board from 1910 to 1920. He also served as city attorney from 1911 to 1913 and city mayor from 1919 to 1927. He represented most of the major oil companies and leading independents including: Humble Oil & Refining Company, Magnolia Petroleum Company (Mobil Oil), Pure Oil Company, Gulf Oil Company, Carter Oil, Skelly Oil, F.W. Merrick, and many others during his first few years in town. Creekology True to his plans, Hefner used his law earnings to purchase mineral rights where he thought oil and gas might one day be produced, based upon his \\"creekology\\". The theory was that because oil is lighter than water, it had been forced uphill in permeable formations and become trapped in subsurface highs, or domes. Surface water runs downhill, so oil should be traced by observing the course of the rivers and streams. It was assumed that subsurface highs correlated to surface highs. In Oklahoma, this trend was in a northwest-southeast direction from Ardmore and also in a northwest-southeast direction from Duncan. He bought anything he could based upon his trending creekology and, by the time he became Supreme Court Justice in 1927, he had already acquired over of land and of mineral rights. Mineral conveyance During his time in Ardmore, there was much debate about whether mineral rights could be conveyed separately from fee-simple title–\\"an opinion held by many noted professors of law and the authors of textbooks on oil-and-gas law\\". About 1912, shortly after the emergence of the Healdton and Cushing oil fields, Hefner prepared the first mineral deed in which he challenged conventional thinking and severed the minerals from their surface counterparts, a form that became known as \\"the Hefner Form\\". He soon began receiving requests for copies of his form from \\"states as far away as Pennsylvania,\\" and it quickly became widely accepted throughout the United States until it was recognized by law. The \\"JZ\\" form of mineral conveyance in current use today, and approved by the Mid-Continent Royalty Owners Association, is based on the original Robert A Hefner Form. Another challenge came from a New York investor named W.L. Hernstadt in 1934. He presented the case that production would eventually come from depths greater than . Hefner supported the theory, but told Hernstadt that it would come long after their time. Hernstadt offered Hefner $10 per net mineral acre for his properties in Carter County and Hefner accepted, a decision that his son would later mock. It was Hefner's grandson, Robert A. Hefner III, who would pioneer gas production at depths approaching in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma during the late 1970s. Public service One of Hefner's key principles, aside from his ardent faith in Christianity and service to the community, was education. He served two years as city attorney in Ardmore and was elected to the Board of Education as President in 1911 – a position he held until 1918. When he found a student of humble means but great promise, he quietly provided funds to make his or her continued education possible. Dozens if not hundreds of youngsters received money from Hefner to continue their schooling. He also liked to help those going into law, like Earl Brown, who had worked in Hefner's office. Earl Brown later inherited Hefner's company, became vice- president, board member and general counsel of Mobil Oil Company, as well as a leading author on oil and gas law. Hefner was elected Mayor of Ardmore in 1920, a position he held for six years. Under his lead, Ardmore overcame a 1919 deficit of $9,000 to a surplus of $193,000 in 1926 when he stepped down. In 1922 a $300,000 bond was also issued for Hickory Creek Reservoir, creating a water supply for Ardmore. As Mayor of Ardmore, Hefner also gave the first speech ever broadcast from the city over the radio. Shortly after his move to Ardmore in 1907–1908, Hefner became known as \\"the Judge\\". The nickname proved apt for Hefner; in 1926, he was asked to run for the Supreme Court of Oklahoma's Fifth District. He was elected in 1927, despite widespread corruption within the court. In 1929, three members of the court were impeached for bribery, coercion, misquotation of facts, conspiracy, corruption, interference with criminal proceedings and incompetency; they were all acquitted. The Federal Bureau of Investigation clearly stated Hefner's innocence during these years and no scandal was ever attached to his name. In his six years as a Supreme Court Justice, Hefner authored 504 opinions. They were all important to the legal history of the state, inasmuch as many of them involved land titles of indigenous peoples. In the case of Wentz v. Thomas, he even issued an opinion against the Governor of Oklahoma, William H. Murray. Other organizations he ardently supported include: * the Boy Scouts of America --which he served as a member of the executive council * the Rotary Club--of which he was President, presiding in 1923 over the National Rotary Club Convention with over 1,500 delegates * the First Baptist Church--in which he was a deacon * the Dad's Association at the University of Oklahoma--of which he was President * the Beaux Arts Ball--of which he was the first King * the Navy League--of which he was Vice-President in Oklahoma * the Freemasons--in which he was at the thirty-second degree, as well as being deputy for the Grand Council in the District of Oklahoma. Mayor of Oklahoma City and Lake Hefner In 1926, Hefner moved the family to Oklahoma City, where he would become mayor in April 1939. This was the last public office he would hold. The first of the major hurdles he faced in Oklahoma City was in securing its water supply. For this effort, Hefner had some strong support, namely E.K. Gaylord, Virgil Browne, and Stanley Draper. The project was haunted by lawsuits and delays introduced by the opposition. The vote for the $6,911,000 bond came to 7,578 people in favor and 7,182 against. Hefner and city manager H.E. Bailey saved the city at least $1,280,000 upon the completion of the Bluff Creek water project by, among other things, renting equipment instead of purchasing. On October 18, 1945, the city council voted unanimously to name the reservoir Lake Hefner. During the war, Hefner played his part. He helped the Navy lead a campaign in Oklahoma City to raise $40 million in war bonds to construct the http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v024/v024p242.pdf to replace the , bringing in Bob Hope to launch the drive. The ship was commissioned on December 8, 1942 after one month of fundraising. With the help of E.K. Gaylord, Virgil Brown and H.E. Bailey, he negotiated with Army officials in an effort to have Washington DC locate a new air depot in Oklahoma City, rather than in any of the other four cities under consideration.\\"Tinker AFB Chronology of Events.\\" 2013. Accessed June 28, 2018. The three officials the Army sent were General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Robert P. Patterson and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. In May 1941, the chief of engineers of the United States Army named the base the Midwest Air Depot (now called Tinker Air Force Base.) Hefner was re-elected in 1942 without any opposition and served out that term before finally stepping down in 1947. Reflection Judge Hefner embodied the \\"American dream\\" with his rags-to-riches story. He enjoyed friendships with Presidents (such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower), serving his community, building a collection of walking canes and cow bells (his favorite a rusty cow bell given to him by Will Rogers and a bell connected to a baseball signed by all the New York Yankees, given to him by their pitcher Allie Reynolds) and helping those of meager means continue their education.

One of the first Indigenous women artists to paint in acrylics, her work has been exhibited at major galleries around Australia, and is held in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. She was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1994 for services to the Yuendumu community. Life Lucy Napaljarri Kennedy was born circa 1926. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Lucy Kennedy' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Lucy is a senior woman of the community at Yuendumu, Northern Territory and, as well as being a working artist, Lucy has been a member of Yuendumu community council. She was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1994, for services to the Yuendumu community. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Lucy is \\"one of the first women painters to paint on canvas with acrylics\\" and her work has been widely exhibited. According to Dussart, the senior women were the first to paint in acrylics at Yuendumu—in 1983, a year before the men. As a senior Yuendumu woman, it is likely that Lucy Kennedy was one of these first painters, though Dussart does not name individuals, instead noting that \\"30 of the most senior women of the settlement decided to pool their ritual knowledge to produce enough painted objects to purchase a used Toyota Land Cruiser\\". As well as participating in regular exhibitions at the Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment in Alice Springs, Lucy Kennedy's paintings have been part of shows at the South Australian Museum (1988, 1989), the Auckland Art Gallery (1991), and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (2000). Lucy was also a collaborator on the 1997 group work Ngapa Jukurrpa (Water Dreaming), held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. As well as painting, Lucy Kennedy has also worked as a printmaker, creating works with the Northern Australia Print Workshop in 2003. These works were titled miinypa jukurrpa, or native red fuchsia dreaming, and examples are held in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia.

Lair Hill, was an American attorney, historian, and newspaper editor in Portland, Oregon. He worked to codify Oregon's and Washington's laws. He briefly owned property in the Portland neighborhood later named after him, Lair Hill. Early life William Hill was born on August 20, 1838, to Reuben Coleman and Margaret Graham (née Lair) Hill in Tennessee.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. pp. 113-114. His father was a doctor and Baptist preacher at their home along the Tennessee River in the southwestern portion of the state. The home in McNairy County was near the site of the 1862 Battle of Shiloh. In 1853, he moved to the Oregon Territory with his parents, with the family settling in Benton County in the Willamette Valley. In Oregon, Hill attended local schools and the Jefferson Institute before finishing his education at McMinnville College (now Linfield College) in McMinnville, a school that his father helped found. While attending college from 1857 to 1859, he met the daughter of the school president, Julia Hall Chandler, whom he later married. After college he began teaching in McMinnville before reading law at the law firm of George Henry Williams and A. C. Gibbs. Hill was admitted to the bar in Oregon in December 1861. Career After becoming a lawyer, he moved to Eastern Oregon where he served in the army during the American Civil War, working as a paymaster stationed in Oregon. From 1864 to 1866, he served as the judge for Grant County. On April 23, 1865, he married Julia Hall Chandler in Canyon City. The couple had four children. He worked as a newspaper editor for the Daily Union and the Daily Times. Hill in about 1890 Hill moved west to Portland in 1866 where he practiced law. There he also became the editor of the city's main newspaper, The Oregonian, in October 1872. He remained as editor until 1877 when Harvey Scott returned to the paper. He was offered appointments to the Supreme Court of the Washington Territory in 1870 and later to the Supreme Court of Idaho Territory, but declined the positions. Hill then moved to The Dalles after his time as editor in hopes of improving his health. There he helped run the Wasco Academy. In 1886, he codified Oregon's laws under authority of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, and then moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1889 where he codified that state's laws. During his legal career he had partnerships with Richard Williams, Marion Francis Mulkey, George Hannibal Durham, H. Y. Thompson, and W. W.

Dale was a pitcher, and played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals (1911–1912) and Cincinnati Reds (1915–1916). He also played in minor league baseball. He was expelled from organized baseball in 1921 for game fixing. Early life Dale was born to Thomas J. Dale, a bricklayer, and Sylvia Dale (née Kahlert) in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 16, 1889. He was the oldest of five children. Career Dale began playing baseball in the semi-professional Trolley League in St. Louis in 1908. In 1910, he debuted in minor league baseball as a pitcher for the Dallas Giants of the Class C Texas League, which became league co-champions that season. He pitched to a 10–7 win–loss record in 204 innings pitched. Though the Boston Red Sox of the American League gave Dale a tryout before the 1911 season, he did not make their roster, and Dale returned to Dallas. After pitching to a 12–8 win–loss record with 179 strikeouts for Dallas in 1911, the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League (NL) purchased Dale from the Giants towards the end of the season. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the Cardinals on September 19, and pitched to a 0–2 record with a 6.75 earned run average (ERA) in innings. The Cardinals returned Dale to Dallas at the end of the season, but reacquired him during the offseason. After Dale pitched to a 0–5 record and a 6.57 ERA for the Cardinals in the 1912 season, they sold Dale to the Montreal Royals of the Class AA International League (IL) that August. Dale pitched to a 4–6 in 10 games started for the remainder of the 1912 season, a 13–10 record during the 1913 season, and a 10–17 record in the 1914 season. Seeking more pitchers, the Cincinnati Reds of the NL drafted Dale from the Royals before the 1915 season. Despite reports that he would be returned to Montreal, catcher Red Dooin convinced the Reds to keep Dale, and he made the Reds' Opening Day roster. Dale proceeded to win 18 games with the Reds during the 1915 season, recording a 2.46 ERA. Dale struggled in 1916, and was removed from the starting rotation and demoted to the bullpen. After traveling to St. Louis without permission of the team, the Reds suspended Dale and sold him to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AA American Association. With the Indians, Dale was a member of the 1917 Junior World Series champions. Dale led the American Association with a 1.50 ERA in the 1918 season, tying with John Merritt. Dale pitched for the Indians through the 1919 season, when they released him after he started the year with two losing outings. He then signed with the Salt Lake City Bees in the Class AA Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Bees were locked in a late season pennant race with the Vernon Tigers that season. The Tigers won the pennant after they defeated the Bees in nine out of 11 games played late in the season, which included three poor performances from Dale. He was suspected of game fixing. The Bees traded Dale to the Dallas Submarines of the Class B Texas League for Eddie Matheson in 1920, as the president of the PCL began to investigate the game fixing allegations. Salt Lake City's Harl Maggert and Vernon's Babe Borton, who were implicated in the investigation, were suspended in August 1920. Borton then implicated other players, including Dale. Dale refused to testify in front of a California grand jury, but appeared at a meeting with minor league executives in Kansas City, Missouri, where he claimed he was innocent. Following the dismissal of criminal charges against Maggert and Borton, the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which governed minor league baseball, expelled Dale, Borton, Maggert and Bill Rumler on January 12, 1921. This expulsion provided Kenesaw Mountain Landis with the precedent needed to ban the conspirators involved in the Black Sox Scandal. Dale continued to pitch in semi-professional baseball for the Cape Girardeau Capahas in 1921. He was honored after the season at a banquet held by the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. Dale appeared in one game for the Newark Bears of the IL that year, but was removed from the roster once word reached the league's offices. Later life After the end of his baseball career, Dale worked for the Steel Products Corporation as a plater. He married a woman named Glen in 1929. The couple had no children. Dale died in St. Louis at the age of 68.

Career Linda Syddick was painting by 1991, when her works were hung in a private gallery—Gallery Gondwana—in Alice Springs. Her works, such as A nest of crosses, gladly borne painted for an exhibition titled Mary Mackillop: a tribute, combine traditional Indigenous painting techniques and motifs with Christian imagery and themes. Linda Syddick had two paintings included in an exhibition, From Appreciation to Appropriation, at the Flinders University Art Museum City Gallery in 2000. One—Eucharist—again looked at Christian influences in Indigenous culture; the other dealt with Hollywood influences, and was titled ET: the bicycle ride. Linda's interest in Christian iconography is reflected in the inclusion of her work The Eucharist in another Flinders University Art Museum exhibition, Holy, Holy, Holy in 2004, which examined the advent of Christianity in Australia. Other works represent her traditional country, such as her painting Tingari Men at Wilkingkarra (Lake Mackay), which was a finalist at the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards. Artists of the Western Desert region, such as Linda Syddick, frequently portray figures from the Tingari cycle of 'songlines', particularly the Tingari Men. These are ancestral elders who − in the Dreaming − travelled over vast areas, performing rituals and creating the country. In 1990 Linda Syddick went to Sydney to see her work Ngkarte Dreaming hung in the Blake Prize exhibition – one of three occasions prior to 1994 on which she was a Blake finalist. The Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art included one of her paintings in 1998.

In modern times, apple dolls are mostly used as decorations or to display craftsmanship, rather than as children's toys. Because of the different effects drying produces, no two dolls are alike. History In colonial America, white settlers and enslaved people fashioned children's toys from utilitarian objects and materials to hand such as corn husks, clothes-pins and rags, using ingenuity and imagination. The use of apples as doll heads was a Native American practice and may have originated among the Iroquois or Seneca people. As colonists came into contact with Native peoples, they copied their dolls; Native peoples also began to make brightly and elaborately costumed apple-head dolls to sell to tourists. Skookum dolls in Native dress, which were popular novelties between 1913 and the early 1960s, were originally made with apple heads; however their creator, Mary Dwyer McAboy, was not Native. Method of making The doll is made in two parts: the head and the body. To make the head, an apple is peeled, then the flesh is carved or pressed using a spoon and paring knife to create the facial features of the doll. In some early examples, the facial features and expressions were produced by pinching the apple as it began to shrink. Next the apple is pierced to the core with a wire and left to dry for up to 30 days. It can be immersed in lemon juice for a day to prevent its turning black. However, the apple will naturally darken in colour during the drying process, and will shrink to about a third its original size. As it shrinks the surface will wrinkle like an old person's face, giving character to the facial expression. One maker, Margaret Owens, explained that only after an apple dried did she decide whether to make the doll male or female, and that sometimes the face becomes misshapen during the drying process and she has to throw the apple away. When the apple is completely dry, white beads or grains of rice can be pushed into the mouth to serve as teeth, and buttons or sequins can be added to serve as eyes. Hair for the doll can be made from wool, yarn, fleece, cotton batting, faux fur, or human hair collected from a hairbrush. This is first glued to a piece of felt, which is then glued to the top of the apple. The finished head is positioned on the top of a wire armature which is shaped into the rest of the doll's body, and padded using rags, paper or wadding. The doll's hands are sometimes modelled using a clay made from bread. The body is then covered by the doll's clothing, which is usually sewn by hand to the maker's tastes.

Career One of the first women of Yuendumu to work with acrylic paints, Brown painted for Warlukurlangu Artists in Yuendumu, which she continued to do when living at Mangurrurpa. In October 1985, she was amongst the artists whose works were exhibited at the first exhibition of paintings from Yuendumu, at the Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment in Alice Springs. Western Desert artists such as Brown will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights. Her works included paintings of Witi Jukurrpa, or ceremonial pole dreaming, Ngarlkirdi, or witchetty grub, Yiwarra, or Milky Way, bandicoot and Two Women. All are associated with the area around Kunajarrayi, or Mount Nicker, an important ceremonial site in the Northern Territory near the Western Australian border. Some of these dreaming stories are shared with other prominent artists, including Paddy Japaljarri Sims, one of the initiators of the Yuendumu doors project, widely considered the genesis of the contemporary Indigenous art movement. Brown is one of a group of artists who contributed some major collaborative works. In 1994 she was one of the artists responsible for Karntakurlangu Jukurrpa (Women's Dreaming), held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The work was exhibited in the gallery as part of the Gamarada exhibition of 1996–97. In 1996 Brown was one of the twenty-nine women and five men who collaborated to produce Karrku Jukurrpa, a work commissioned for the collection of John Kluge and exhibited in the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection at the University of Virginia.

This is in contrast to primary acquisitions of other companies which are generally in different industries, require larger investments, or are of similar size to the acquiring company. The trend of making bolt-on acquisitions is particularly prominent in downmarkets. Private equity firms support such smaller and strategic acquisitions in order to increase the value of the acquiring company prior to sale. Also in a downmarket, companies look to grow via smaller, strategic acquisitions rather than building through major business purchases or mergers that represent higher risks or are more difficult to finance. These bolt-on acquisitions allow companies to enhance their product portfolio, technological position, market reach and customer service capabilities with much lower levels of investment. Another major advantage of bolt-on acquisitions is the enhancement of core businesses and using mergers and acquisitions activity to gain leadership positions in a limited number of areas. Bolt-on acquisition companies look to become more specialized in smaller selected areas rather than following a diversifying strategy. Other potential benefits of these acquisitions over bigger acquisitions are: * Require less work to integrate as companies being acquired are smaller * Competition between buyers may be less. * Smaller companies are often more willing to be acquired by large companies. * Opens up more options for large companies looking for acquisitions as restrictions on size etc. do not apply * Allows entry into new geographic markets and increased penetration in existing markets without the struggles of setting up new locations, especially for chain stores Examples Chemical companies like Akzo Nobel and Dupont have made significant number of bolt-on acquisitions. According to a recent survey, 97 per cent of private equity firms expect at least one in four of the companies in their portfolio to undertake a bolt-on buy prior to exit..http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE5076I520090108  References  Category:Mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Bolt-on acquisition"},{"id":"25797477","text":"Prentiss Taylor (December 13, 1907 – October 7, 1991) was an American illustrator, lithographer, and painter. Born in Washington D.C., Taylor began his art studies at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, followed by painting classes under Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and training at the Art Students League in New York City. In 1931, Taylor began studying lithography at the League. Taylor interacted and collaborated with many writers and musicians in his time in New York in the late 1920s and early 30s. This was in the emergence of the Harlem Renaissance. Among his close friends and colleagues were Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten. Taylor's work is in the collection of numerous institutions such as: the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art; The Phillips Collection; Gibbes Museum of Art; Museum of New Mexico; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Whitney Museum of American Art Fisk University Galleries and Greenville County Museum of Art.Prentiss Taylor, The Lithographs of Prentiss Taylor: A Catalogue Raisonné  Biography = Early life  Born on December 13, 1907 at home to John Eastlack Taylor and Beatrice Hottel. His birth assisted by his grandmother's cook, known as Cookie Belle. In high school, Prentiss graduated from McKinley \\"Tech\\" High School, where he had studied art under Mary P. Shipman, Alexis Manny and Charles Lamb. He graduated from Sidwell Friends School in 1925.  College years  In the 1920s, Taylor studied painting with Charles W. Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, but turned to lithography in the late 1920s to early 1930s during his enrollment at the Art Students League in New York City. He received further training in that medium at the George C. Miller workshop in New York. During this period, he also designed costumes for the American-Oriental Revue, as well as designed scenery for plays at the Arts Club of Washington.  Adulthood  Prentiss established the Washington Wheat Press as a means for publishing, and within the paper were various poems and illustrations by the artist as well as poems and prose by Josiah Titzell, Rachel Field and Laura Benet. After Taylor discovered lithographing in 1931, he worked primarily in the printmaking medium for the rest of his life, experimenting with various techniques and compositions and ultimately achieving a status as one this country's great lithographers. Taylor depicted mostly realistic and narrative scenes of subjects and themes that reflected his personal interests in music, architecture, religion and social justice.Prentiss Taylor, The Lithographs of Prentiss Taylor: A Catalogue Raisonné  Death  In 1990, Taylor had his last exhibition while still alive at Georgetown University in their Lauinger Library called \\"The Art of Prentiss Taylor\\", which included lithographs, watercolor paintings and book jacket designs. In 1991, Taylor's health began deteriorating. In April, (age 83) he was put in a nursing home and was hospitalized in September due to a pneumonia and a heart infection. Prentiss Taylor died on October 7, 1991.  Career =Colleagues and Connections  Prentiss Taylor During his time in New York, Taylor developed a bond with poet Langston Hughes and writer Carl Van Vechten. Hughes and Taylor joined together towards the end of 1931 to create the Golden Stair Press, issuing broadsides and books with illustrations by Taylor and texts by Hughes reflecting the ideas of the Harlem Renaissance. Among their joint publications are The Negro Mother and Other Dramatic Recitations and the Scottsboro Limited. In 1931, in Depression-plagued Alabama, nine black youths were falsely accused of rape by two white women. The court trials became known as the Scottsboro case, and the black youths as \\"the Scottsboro boys.\\" By the end of that year Langston Hughes, had written a play about the injustice, and the following year he added four poems to his play to make a booklet. He asked his friend, the white artist Prentiss Taylor, to illustrate the poems. The four lithographs in this exhibition are the product of that collaboration. At age twenty, Taylor met Charleston novelist, Josephine Pinckney, at the MacDowell artists' colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Their new friendship prompted Taylor to visit Charleston, South Carolina in 1933, because Pinckney asked friends to loan Taylor the Pink House. (book-southern life) Prentiss stated \\"I arrived on the Clyde-Mallory Line Steamer about the end of May 1933…I was lent the Pink House on Chalmers Street and I was able to stay until Labor Day. I spent most of my time sketching, up one side of the street and down the other.\\" Taylor returned to the city in 1934 under the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), a predecessor to the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. James Sears, Edwin and John: A Personal History of the American South Taylor took a few photos of Zora Neale Hurston at parties in New York City, notably \\"The Crow Dance\\" in 1935. Most of Hurston's other photos were taken by Carl Van Vechten.http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3531941 Carl Van Vechten took several portraits of Prentiss and some of which are in the Prentiss Taylor Papers archives. Van Vechten is more closely tied with Langston Hughes, but Prentiss is colleagues by association. In Taylor's diaries during the time of him working as an art therapist, he had several meetings with Ezra Pound, and his wife and son. Pound was surprised to find an intellectual in Taylor, with whom he could discuss literature and art. Taylor was a pioneer in psychotherapy through art within Harlem Renaissance figures and various clients. Prentiss was seen often with Jimmy Daniels, one of the most popular cafe singers and masters of ceremonies of the Harlem Renaissance, in New York, Carl Van Vechten and Langston Hughes—all of which are supposedly homosexual. Prentiss also appears in the 'Lesbian and Gay Presence' in the Archives of American Art. Composer of Appalachian Spring, Aaron Copland, a private man, much like Prentiss, was disinclined to write about his personal life. Copland and Taylor met in the summer of 1928, and the two struck up a correspondence in November of that year. Copland's initial letters express a warm expression of good friendship. In Spring of 1929, however, friendship evolved into romance. Copland declares \\"It's always a dangerous business to write the kind of letter I sent you.\\" in March 1929, \\" Now that I know how you took it, I don't regret having sent it.\\" A variety of Copland's letters to Taylor are available online, as a testament of the beauty of love in written word. No letters from Taylor are in archives because Copland lived overseas in France most of the time and eventually they fell out of touch. One of the last letters from Copland states that he wishes Prentiss was there to be his \\"sole diversion.\\" Aaron Copland, The Selected Correspondence of Aaron Copland By Aaron Copland, p.69-72  Painting  Taylor studied painting with Charles W. Hawthorne in Provincetown until Taylor discovered lithography, then he occasionally did wash painting with ink, several watercolor paintings in his westward travels and oil painting occasionally, but more lithographs were produced total.  Lithography and Illustration  Prentiss Taylor spent a great of time in the Charleston, SC area and produced a group of prints that captured the feel of the time. His work in the American Southwest depicts a grandness of scenery coupled with his usual almost realistic mystery. Taylor began his study of lithography in 1931 at the Art Students League in New York City. \\"With the first magic feeling of the crayon working in the fine grain of stone, I knew I was at home in lithography,\\" the artist was to later write. Taylor's first lithograph was \\"Negro Head,\\" composed in 1931. His last composition was \\"Church at Trampass,\\" composed in 1983. In his 52 years as a lithographer, Taylor created 137 lithographs (to our knowledge) – many of which follow the parameters of realism. Taylor also traveled extensively, particularly in the American Southwest and Mexico, whose landscapes and culture heavily flavor and influence his perspective and style of lithography.  Art therapy  From 1943 to 1954 Taylor served as art therapist on the staff of St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, and later with the staff of Chestnut Lodge in Rockville, Maryland. In addition, the February 1950 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry carried his important contribution to the literature, \\"Art as Psychotherapy.\\"  Teaching  In 1935, Prentiss taught lithography at Studio House in Washington DC. (affiliated with Phillips Memorial Gallery) Prentiss returned to DC and taught oil painting at American University from 1955-1975.  Accomplishments = Harlem Renaissance influence  \\"I prepared a smaller booklet of some of my newer poems to sell for a quarter. Its title poem was \\"The Negro mother\\" Prentiss Taylor, a young artist in Greenwich Village designed the booklet, endowed it with a dozen handsome black and white drawings and supervised the printing of it. Since Prentiss Taylor was white, and I, colored, I thought maybe such a book, evidence in itself of interracial collaboration and good will, might help democracy a little in the south where it seemed so hard for people to be friends across the color line. Few white people bought our book, but to Negroes, I sold three large prints. Poetry took me into the hearts and homes of colored people all over the south.\\" -Langston Hughes Carl Van Vechten was a huge supporter of booklet \\"Scottsboro, Limited\\" and financially backed it, so Taylor and Hughes were able to print and sell the 4 page poem, 4 page lithograph booklet at fifty cents each, and signed copies at three dollars. Before printing, Hughes would write to Taylor that he was more excited for the publishing of this work than anything he's ever written.  Traveling  Taylor moved to Provincetown, MA in 1924 to study under Charles W. Hawthorne, when plans to go to New York City to study stage design under Norman Bel Geddes fell through. He moved back to D.C. in 1926 to finish high school, then in 1927 found early work at 19 in New York City designing costumes for a stage revue, while also designing book jackets and publishing prose. Prentiss did black/white and color illustrations for various poetical works in Peterborough, New Hampshire in 1928 at the MacDowell Colony. From 1930 to 1935 Taylor worked and studied in New York City in Greenwich Village, and traveled to Charleston, SC for 4 months in 1933 which led to a series of lithographs. In 1935, Taylor returned to live in Washington DC, and moved again shortly in 1936 across the Potomac in Virginia and remained there until 1954. In 1936, he traveled to the Virgin Islands, which inspired watercolors, drawings and prints (nos. 50, 55, 56.) In 1940, he traveled to Mexico and worked on various prints, and went to Mexico once again in 1962. After those trips, Taylor found much work around the New England area. In 1958, he traveled west to New Mexico and Colorado to produce prints. From 1964-1969, Taylor visited Europe (Spain, Italy, France; later on the Low Countries and the British Isles; and Russia late in the decade.) Spain inspired several prints. In 1975, he visited Italy, Austria, Munich and Lugano. In 1985, he visited France and Denmark. In 1988, he traveled for the last time—visiting the west coast of France, Spain and Portugal.  Awards and Exhibits  In 1934, after fellowships at the MacDowell Colony and at Yaddo, the MacBeth Gallery gave Taylor his first one- person exhibition in New York City. After returning to Washington, D.C., Taylor's work was included in exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery, the Smithsonian Institution, the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. He was represented by the Franz Bader Gallery in Washington, D.C., and by the Bethesda Art Gallery in Maryland. http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/prentiss-taylor-papers-9232/more In 1942, Taylor was elected President of the Society of Washington Printmakers, a position he held for thirty-four years. In 1948 he was elected an associate of the prestigious National Academy of Design. Retrospective Print Exhibition in 1971 displayed 40 years of Taylor's work (54 prints), years 1931 through 1971. The exhibits at the Corcoran and Smithsonian are the only known permanent exhibits, although there may be extended exhibits.  Legacy = Prentiss Papers The collection measures 20.4 linear feet, dates from 1885 to 1991 (bulk dates 1908-1986) and documents the career of Prentiss Taylor. The collection consists primarily of subject and correspondence files, reflecting Prentiss' career as a lithographer and painter, his association with figures prominent in the Harlem Renaissance, his activities as president of the Society of Washington Printmakers and other art organizations, his work in art therapy treating mental illness, and his teaching position at American University. The subject files contain mostly correspondence, but many include photographs and printed material. Also included are biographical, financial, legal and printed material, several hundred photographs, notes and writings, sketchbooks, drawings and a few prints by Taylor, and scrapbooks dating from 1885-1956. Many pieces in collaborating with Langston Hughes are found in the Langston Hughes files, containing photocopies of letters between the two, cards, original photographs of Hughes taken by Taylor, and an autographed card printed with The Negro Speaks of Rivers. The contract between Taylor and Hughes (witnessed by Carl Van Vechten) that forms the Golden Stair Press—a duo organization through many of Hughes' poems were printed with illustrations by Taylor. A rare edition of The Negro Mother, Hughes and Taylor's first publication, is found here. The final copy of the 1932 Scottsboro Limited is in the Hughes files as well. Rare Harlem Renaissance publications illustrated by Taylor also found in these files are Golden Stair Broadsides, Opportunity Journal of Negro Life, The Rebel Poet, and Eight Who Lie in the Death House. Correspondence between Van Vechten and Taylor are found in the files, along with autographed copies of Van Vechten's booklets, and photographs of Harlem Renaissance figures (including Zora Neale Hurston, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, Diego Rivera, Frieda Kahlo, etc.) Popular period photographs of South Carolina and Harlem street scenes can be found here. The Prentiss Taylor papers offer researchers insight into the rich cultural documentation of the Harlem Renaissance and the development of twentieth-century printmaking as an American fine art. The Prentiss Taylor papers were donated in 1978 and 1984 by Taylor, and in 1992 and 2004 by his companion, Roderick S. Quiroz, for the estate of Prentiss Taylor. The material lent by Taylor for microfilming in 1978 on reel 1392 was not included as a later gift, and is not described in this finding aid. The collection contains photocopies of letters from Langston Hughes and Alice B. Toklas that Lawrence donated to Yale University Library. Prentiss Taylor papers are also located at the Yale University Library. The papers were processed in May 2005 by Jean Fitzgerald, and microfilmed in 2005 with funding provided by the Judith Rothschild Foundation. The collection was digitized from the microfilm in 2008 with funding provided by the Terra Foundation of American Art. Location of Originals: 95 letters from Rachel Field, 75 letters from Langston Hughes, 3 letters from Armin Landeck, 46 letters from Josephine Pinckney, 1 letter from Gertrude Stein, 7 letters from Alice B. Toklas, 1 postcard from Mark Van Doren, and 25 letters from Carl Van Vechten are photocopies. Originals of the Hughes and Toklas letters are located at the Yale University Library. Location of the remaining original letters are unknown. Series The collection is arranged into ten series. The largest series housing Subject Files is arranged alphabetically, primarily by name of correspondent, maintaining Taylor's original arrangement.

She is a painter and printmaker whose work has been collected by the National Gallery of Australia. Life Valerie Lynch was born 13 September 1970 at Papunya, Northern Territory. As of 2008 she lived at Papunya, and is a director of the Papunya Tjupi Art Centre Aboriginal Corporation. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Valerie Lynch' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Valerie Lynch is a member of Papunya Tjupi, a group of descendants of the Papunya Tula painters of the 1970s. Her work Women Digging for Honey Ants at Karrinyarra was included in a group exhibition, organised by prominent curator and author Vivien Johnson, at the Ivan Dougherty Gallery in 2007. The exhibition marked the opening of the first art centre in three decades at the Papunya community. As well as painting, Valerie Lynch has undertaken printmaking. Two of her prints, made using open-bite etching and aquatint, are in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. These were made in 2007, published by Cicada Press, and purchased by the gallery in that same year. Also in 2007, Valerie Lynch participated in a group exhibition, organised through the University of New South Wales College of Fine Arts, and held at Orange, New South Wales Regional Gallery. Her work was exhibited alongside that of other prominent Australian artists including Adam Cullen, John Coburn, Cherry Hood and Michael Nelson Jagamarra.

In 2003, an attempt was made to mount a Broadway production starring Farrah Fawcett. However, the show closed during previews. Plot Set in 1967 in Crestview, Florida and centers around Bobbi. She runs the charm school and is a theater star. It is a quaint, small town, and is trying to keep at bay the Rock n' Roll which is becoming more and more present. It's where a measure of a man is how much he provides for his family, where sexuality is overlooked, charm schools are still present and the theater is important part of everyone's social life. Twenty years earlier, Bobbi was Miss Florida, and from that she gained valid beliefs of the way ladies and gentlemen should act towards each other. Sam is her gay haberdasher neighbor and theatre director. Bobbi is married to her high school sweetheart, Roger, who was once a great football player. He currently works at an office and hates it, and would much rather be doing carpentry. He has become a Joe Shmoe, wearing the suit and tie, and doing the job to satisfy his wife's idea of a husband, complete with him climbing the corporate ladder and keeping an elegant and prosperous house. The play opens with Bobbi and Roger prepping the house because the owner of his company, George McGowan, to entertain the possibility of a promotion for him. Bobbi then has one of her charm school students, Susan, be hostess and Bobbi nags Roger before the bell rings.

Career  Phipps was born on December 25, 1931 in Newark, New Jersey, United States into a jazz family.Swing City: Newark Nightlife, 1925–50 (2002) pp. 212–213. Barbara J. Kukla, Rutgers University Press, New Jersey. Phipp's cousin, Eugene Phipps, Sr. traveled with Billie Holiday, Joe Guy, Max Roach and Ike Quebec on a national tour. Cousin Ernie Phipps led the big band The Monarchs of Rhythm with Eugene Phipps, Sr. at the Savoy Ballroom along with The Sultans of Swing, Poncho Diggs, and other big bands. During the 1950s Eugene Phipps co-led the house band at Newark's legendary Washington Bar, which featured performers such as Babs Gonzales, Lew-Rew Jordan, and Ike Quebec. In the 1950s Billy Phipps along with brother Nat Phipps formed a band whose members included Wayne Shorter, Grachan Moncur, Chris White, Charlie Mason, Harold Phipps and Robert Thomas. Phipps began his jazz career playing bebop on flute and baritone saxophone. As a teenager, Phipps was a regular in Newark and New York bands, once opening for Billie Holiday.New Jersey Star Ledger, 2007-04-15. Holiday in Newark: An anniversary remembrance of the jazz legend. http://newarktalk.com/talk/viewtopic.php?t=8242&sid;=e3f8549884bcb5693a0e71da2d901bbe In 1960 the Phipps band broke up to form the Mega Tones. Billy Phipps left the Mega Tones to tour with Buddy Johnson, Dizzy Gillespie and his Big Band, The Ray Charles Band, and \\"Brother\\" Jack McDuff. Encouraged by Wayne Shorter who introduced Phipps to John Coltrane, Phipps began shifting to hard bop in his style. Despite a significant jazz career, the lack of Phipps's notoriety (as well as that of other black jazz performers) has been attributed to the reportage of white jazz critics.  Recording and performance  Phipps recorded baritone sax on several seminal jazz albums, including Primitive Modern with the Gil Melle Quartet (1956), Gin and Orange (1969) with Brother Jack McDuff, and Ocho (1972) with Chico Mendoza.Essential Jazz Records, Vol. 2: Modernism to Postmodernism (2000) p. 628 Max Harrison, Eric Thacker, Stuart Nicholson. Mansell Publishing. Los Altos, CA. Phipps performed internationally, touring Sweden, France, England, and the Netherlands with McDuff's band. Phipps was a featured performer in 2003 during the Jazz Foundation of America's Annual \\"Great Night In Harlem\\" Concert at the Apollo Theater, hosted by Bill Cosby, Chevy Chase, Whoopi Goldberg and Branford Marsalis. Despite failing health, Phipps continued to perform live in the New York city area and to record with other notable jazz musicians. In an homage to his Newark origins, Phipps performed with the Newark Jazz Elders, whose members provided a generational bridge between 1950s bebop and contemporary jazz.

He is most notable for leading the lawsuit against WorldCom on behalf of the New York State Common Retirement Fund and other plaintiffs. In the WorldCom case, Coffey and his team recovered over $6 billion from Wall Street banks and forced the responsible parties to personally pay millions of dollars in compensation. This led Bloomberg Markets to dub Coffey \\"Wall Street's New Nemesis.\\" In late 2009, Coffey retired from his partnership at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann to seek the Democratic nomination for New York State Attorney General in which he finished third out of five candidates.

In June 2012, Sean was honored by the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center (headquartered in Westchester County NY) for his dedication to human rights and his service to the Center as a director.. Legal career In 1987, after resigning from active naval duty, Coffey returned to New York as a litigation associate with Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. Coffey was appointed an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York in 1991. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Coffey worked with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies prosecuting a wide variety of cases involving firearms, narcotics, business crime, bank fraud, and other major crimes. Coffey tried many cases to verdict. In 1995, Coffey joined the law firm of Latham & Watkins where, as counsel and then partner, he defended Fortune 500 companies in many complex civil, regulatory, and criminal matters. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann After several years as a corporate defense attorney, Coffey returned to pursuing corporate misconduct at the litigation firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, which represents many of the world's largest institutional investors, including New York State's Common Retirement Fund and Teachers' Retirement System and many Taft-Hartley union funds. During his eleven years at Bernstein Litowitz, Coffey led teams that recovered billions of dollars for victims of corporate fraud and won praise for achieving significant corporate governance improvements. Among Coffey's notable successes is his role in the WorldCom securities litigation, a case he took to trial in 2005 as lead attorney for thousands of investors, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund. Coffey and his team recovered over $6 billion from Wall Street banks and, in a historic first, required all outside directors and key wrongdoers to contribute millions of dollars from their personal funds. Coffey was selected as one of the National Law Journal's \\"Winning Attorneys\\" of 2005, and was profiled by the American Lawyer, the Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg Markets magazine, which dubbed him \\"Wall Street's New Nemesis.\\"Rovella, David. \\"Wall Street's New Nemesis.\\" Bloomberg Markets Sep 2005. In 2002, as a result of the Baptist Foundation of Arizona's collapse, the largest non-profit bankruptcy in U.S. history, Coffey led a team in trial against auditing firm Arthur Andersen. Acting on behalf of victimized retired Baptist investors, Coffey and his team recovered a $217 million settlement, one of the largest amounts ever paid by an accounting firm. Navy Reserve Service After leaving active duty to pursue his legal career in New York, Coffey served in the Navy as a reservist for more than eighteen years. In addition to one or more weekends each month maintaining proficiency as a P-3C mission commander, Coffey carried out annual duty assignments including armed flights in support of the embargo of the former Yugoslavia and counter- narcotic patrols over Latin America and the Gulf of Mexico. Coffey was selected to command one of the Navy's elite reserve squadrons, Patrol Squadron 92 (the \\"Minutemen\\"), and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for his service as skipper from 1996 - 1998. Coffey was promoted to Captain and selected to command the reserve component of the Enterprise carrier battle group staff. He then was assigned as an IMA (Individual Mobilization Augmentee) for the Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon, concentrating on issues relating to the stresses imposed on reservists by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Coffey retired from the Navy in 2004 after thirty years of service. His other military decorations include the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Navy Pistol Expert Medal. New York State Attorney General Race In October 2009, Coffey retired from his partnership at Bernstein Litowitz to pursue the Democratic nomination for New York State Attorney General. Although he had never before run for political office, Coffey reported that he had raised over $1.65 million in the first two months of his campaign.http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/01/165-m-for- would-be-ag-coffey.html The Wall Street Journal cited Coffey as one of the top three contenders for the position. Most of the money Coffey raised was not from Wall Street donors, but instead from fellow lawyers.

The problem discusses two millionaires, Alice and Bob, who are interested in knowing which of them is richer without revealing their actual wealth. This problem is analogous to a more general problem where there are two numbers a and b and the goal is to determine whether the inequality a \\\\geq b is true or false without revealing the actual values of a and b. The Millionaires' problem is an important problem in cryptography, the solution of which is used in e-commerce and data mining. Commercial applications sometimes have to compare numbers that are confidential and whose security is important. Many solutions have been introduced for the problem, among which the first solution, presented by Yao himself, was exponential in time and space. Protocols and proof=The protocol of Hsiao-Ying Lin and Wen-Guey Tzeng  Let s = s_n s_{n-1} \\\\ldots s_1 \\\\in {0, 1}^n be a binary string of length n. Denote 0-encoding of s as S_s^0 = {s_n s_{n-1} \\\\ldots s_{i+1} 1 \\\\mid s_i = 0; 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n} and 1-encoding of s as S_s^1 = {s_n s_{n-1} \\\\ldots s_i \\\\mid s_i = 1; 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n}. Then, the protocol is based on the following claim: : Assume that a and b are binary strings of length n bits. : Then a > b if the sets S_a^1 and S_b^0 have a common element (where a and b are the binary encodings of the corresponding integers). The protocol leverages this idea into a practical solution to Yao's Millionaires' problem by performing a private set intersection between S_a^1 and S_b^0. The protocol of Ioannidis and Ananth The protocol uses a variant of oblivious transfer, called 1-2 oblivious transfer. In that transfer one bit is transferred in the following way: a sender has two bits S_0 and S_1. The receiver chooses i \\\\in {0, 1}, and the sender sends S_i with the oblivious transfer protocol such that # the receiver doesn't get any information about S_{(1-i)}, # the value of i is not exposed to the sender. To describe the protocol, Alice's number is indicated as a, Bob's number as b, and it is assumed that the length of their binary representation is less than d for some d \\\\in \\\\mathbb N. The protocol takes the following steps. # Alice creates a matrix K of size d \\\\times 2 of k-bit numbers, where k is the length of the key in the oblivious transfer protocol. In addition, she chooses two random numbers u and v, where 0 \\\\leq u < 2k and v \\\\leq k. # K_{ijl} will be the l-th bit of the number that appears in cell K_{ij} (where l = 0 indicates the least significant bit). In addition, a_i is denoted as the i-th bit of Alice's number a. For every i, 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq d Alice does the following actions. ## For every bit j \\\\geq v she sets K_{i1j} and K_{i2j} to random bits. ## If a_i = 1, let l = 1, otherwise let l = 2 and for every j,\\\\ 0 \\\\leq j \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot i - 1 set K_{ilj} to a random bit. ## For m = 2 \\\\cdot i set K_{il(m+1)} = 1 and K_{ilm} to a_i. ## For every i, 1 \\\\leq i < d, S_i will be a random k-bit number, and S_d will be another number of k bits where all bits except the last two are random, and the last two are calculated as S_{d(k-1)} = 1 \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{j=1}^{d-1} S_{j(k-1)} \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{j=1}^d K_{j1(k-1)} and S_{d(k-2)} = 1 \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{j=1}^{d-1} S_{j(k-2)} \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{j=1}^d K_{j1(k-2)}, where \\\\bigoplus is the bitwise XOR operation. ## For l = 1, 2 set K'_{ij} = \\\\operatorname{rot}(K_{il} \\\\oplus S_i, u). Where \\\\operatorname{rot}(x, t) indicates the bitwise rotation of x to the left by t bits. # For every i, 0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq d Bob transfers K'_{il} with the oblivious transfer protocol, where l = b_i + 1, and b_i is the i-th bit of b. # Alice sends to Bob N = \\\\operatorname{rot}\\\\left(\\\\bigoplus_{j=1}^d S_j, u\\\\right). # Bob calculates the bitwise XOR of all the numbers he got in step 3 and N from step 4. Bob scans the result from left to right until he finds a large sequence of zero bits. Let c be the bit to the right of that sequence (c is non zero). If the bit to the right of c equals 1, then a \\\\geq b, otherwise a < b. Proof Correctness = Bob calculates the final result from N \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^d K'_{i(b_i+1)} = \\\\operatorname{rot}\\\\left(\\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^d K_{i(b_i+1)}, u\\\\right), and the result depends on c = \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^d K_{i(b_i+1)}. K, and therefore c as well, can be split into 3 parts. The left part doesn't affect the result. The right part has all the important information, and in the middle is a sequence of zeros that separates those two parts. The length of each partition of c is linked to the security scheme. For every i, only one of K_{i1}, K_{i2} has non-zero right part, and it is K_{i1} if a_i = 1, and K_{i2} otherwise. In addition, if i > j, and K_{il} has a non-zero right part, then K_{il} \\\\oplus K_{jl} has also a non-zero right part, and the two leftmost bits of this right part will be the same as the one of A_{il}. As a result, the right part of c is a function of the entries Bob transferred correspond to the unique bits in a and b, and the only bits in the right part in c that are not random are the two leftmost, exactly the bits that determines the result of a_i > b_i, where i is the highest-order bit in which a and b differ. In the end, if a_i > b_i, then those two leftmost bits will be 11, and Bob will answer that a \\\\geq b. If the bits are 10, then a_i < b_i, and he will answer a < b. If a = b, then there will be no right part in c, and in this case the two leftmost bits in c will be 11, and will indicate the result. = Security = The information Bob sends to Alice is secure because it is sent through oblivious transfer, which is secure. Bob gets 3 numbers from Alice: # \\\\operatorname{rol}(K_{i(1+b_i)} \\\\oplus S_i, u). For every i Bob receives one such number, and S_i is random, so no secure information is transformed. # N. This is an XOR of random numbers, and therefore reveals no information. The relevant information is revealed only after calculating c. # c. The same goes for c. The left part of c is random, and the right part is random as well, except for the two leftmost bits. Deducing any information from those bits requires guessing some other values, and the chance of guessing them correct is very low. Complexity The complexity of the protocol is O(d^2). Alice constructs d-length number for each bit of a, and Bob calculates XOR d times of d-length numbers. The complexity of those operations is O(d^2). The communication part takes also O(d^2). Therefore, the complexity of the protocol is O(d^2).

Personal Henrey was the son of Robert Selby Henrey- grandson of Sir Coutts Lindsay, 2nd Baronet- and the memoirist Madeleine Gal.http://www.bhsproject.co.uk/families_henrey.shtml#RSHg Gal would go on to write about her son's film career in two of her many volumes of memoirs, the 1948 A Film Star in Belgrave Square and the 1950 A Journey To Vienna. He went on to study at Downside School and Oxford University, where he obtained a degree in language and literature. At age 25, Henrey moved to the United States, eventually settling in Greenwich, Connecticut. He and his wife Lisette had a son, Edward, a graphic artist and illustrator and a daughter, Dominique, who died from a food allergy at the age of 18,http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi- bin/columbia?a=d&d;=cs19890123-01.2.13&e;=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN- ezra+koenig----- having suffered all her life from poor health.Through Grown- up Eyes: Living with Childhood Fame, Polperro Heritage Press, 2013 Career Robert Henrey's autobiography, 'Through Grown-up Eyes: Living with Childhood Fame', was published by Polperro Heritage Press in September 2013.Polperro Heritage Press - Through Grown-up Eyes by Robert Henrey Henrey was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme in December 2015 where he discussed the impact that The Fallen Idol had on his childhood and adult life. Acting Henrey was cast in The Fallen Idol on the basis of a photograph of him which appeared on the dustjacket of his father's book A Village in Piccadilly.https://vimeo.com/103588872 Studio head of London Films Alexander Korda passed on the photograph to director Carol Reed, who thought it exactly matched his vision of the character, Phillipe, even though the photo had actually been taken in 1942 and showed Henrey when he was three years old. Henrey's parents agreed to let him make the film and a screen test was arranged. But at the time, Henrey, by that time eight years of age, was on holiday at his grandmother's farm in Normandy. So Korda sent a plane over to France to pick him up and fly him to London for the test. Carol Reed liked him at once, especially his liquid French accent, which the part called for. Reed sat down for the first of many talks with Henrey and never saw another child. Henrey was paid £1,000 for his role, with a stipulation that if the film took more than ten weeks to make, he would be paid an extra £100 for every additional week. Because the film took eight months to make, a long time for that era, due to Reed's exacting standards, Henrey eventually earned £5,000. When the film was released, the critics were very impressed with Henrey's performance in the film, with one calling him the greatest kid since Jackie Coogan and Henrey became a star overnight. On the strength of his performance in the film, Henrey was signed to a £30,000 contract by Sir Alexander Korda to make four more films for his company between 1948 and 1952, only one of which, The Wonder Kid, was ever made. This was filmed in late 1949 - early 1950, but not released until 1952. However, it was not a great success, influencing his family's belief that he should return to education. Finance Henrey worked for a number of years as a tax consulting partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers in New York City until his retirement in 1997. The Ministry Henrey was ordained as a deacon in 1984 and went on to serve as an interfaith chaplain at Greenwich Hospital after his certification in 2001.

By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.

Lewis (also called Battery 116), a casemated coastal defense battery of two 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 2 guns, along with Battery 219, a coastal defense battery of two 6-inch M1903 guns on the hill to the south of the Twin Lights Lighthouse. The batteries were garrisoned by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps as part of the Harbor Defenses of New York. Battery Lewis was one of the primary batteries guarding Greater New York in World War II, along with another 16-inch battery at Fort Tilden in Queens and two 12-inch long- range batteries at Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook. These rendered all previous heavy guns in the area obsolete, and these were gradually scrapped during the war. After World War II it was determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and the guns at Navesink were scrapped in 1948. Twin Lights station The Twin Lights Aircraft Warning Corps Site 8A was an Army radar site that reported radar data to an Information Filter and Control Center in the New York Telephone building (now the Verizon Building) in New York City during World War II. The station was used for a November 1939 demonstration for the Secretary of War in which radar data was networked from the local SCR-270 radar and, via telephone, from one in Connecticut that both tracked a Mitchel Field B-17 bomber formation. From 1942-5, the site had a World War II Westinghouse SCR-271 radar for early warning. The site was operated by the 608th Signal Aircraft Warning Battalion. Between 1946 and June 1948 the site was operated as a research field station by the Lt. Colonel Paul E. Watson Laboratories in Red Bank, New Jersey. Watson Laboratories set up an experimental model of an AN/CPS-6 Radar which was developed at the end of World War II by M.I.T. After the 1948 Berlin Blockade in Germany, the Cold War was on and with the appearance of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-4 intercontinental bomber in 1947, a major concern of the United States was a possible attack by Soviet long-range bombers. In 1948, the United States Air Force (USAF) directed its Air Defense Command (ADC) to take radar sets out of storage for operation in the Northeastern United States. In June 1948, Air Defense Command activated the 646th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at the Twin Light Lashup Site L-12 with the Watson Laboratories General Electric AN/CPS-6 Radar and an AN/TPS-1B radar providing radar data to the Manual Control Center at Roslyn Air Warning Station, New York as part of the Lashup Radar Network. In December 1950, 646th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron moved from the Twin Lights Lashup site to the Navesink Military Reservation with a new General Electric AN/CPS-6 Radar. In July 1951 the Air Defense Command accepted the new radar and designated the site P-9 as the 9th new Permanent radar site in the nation as part of the Air Defense Command Permanent radar network. In December 1953 the Navesink Military Reservation was renamed to the Highlands Air Force Station. In 1955 a General Electric AN/FPS-8 Radar for medium range surveillance was installed to augment the radar data of the General Electric AN/CPS-6 Radar and was (later converted to a General Electric AN/GPS-3 RadarThe AN/GPS-3 is composed of a surveillance radar set,[e.g., radar set of the AN/FPS-8] Tower AB-397/FPS-8, and Radar Recognition Set AN/UPX-6. Source: that remained until 1960.) Nine units of officers housing were built in 1955 near Battery 219. In March 1957 the Highlands Air Force Station began operating the first Bendix AN/FPS-14 Radar in the nation at the radar Gap Filler site P-9A in Gibbsboro, New Jersey until 1960. In 1958, four General Electric AN/FPS-6 Radar were added to the site along with a General Electric AN/FPS-7 Radar. SAGE site In 1958, Highlands Air Force Station began providing data to Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Direction Center DC-01 at McGuire AFB which had Air Defense Command interceptor aircraft and CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missiles. In September 1959, the Highlands Air Force Station was the first site in the nation with a General Electric AN/FPS-7 Radar used for long range surveillance for the Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense System and the Air Force. (The 1262nd U.S. Army Signal Missile Master Support Detachment provided site maintenance to the Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense System from 1960 to 1966.) The Missile Master at the Highlands Air Force Station was the Army's command post for the New York- Philadelphia Defense Area and was designated as Nike Site NY-55DC and was a NORAD Control Center. It was operated by the 52nd Artillery Brigade (Air Defense). Texas Tower 4 (call sign \\"Dora\\") was an offshore radar annex of Highlands Air Force Station operated by a 646th Radar Squadron (SAGE) from 1958 until it collapsed into the Atlantic Ocean on January 15, 1961, killing 28 people. The Highlands Air Force Station had an AN/FRC-56 Tropospheric scatter Communications shore station which communicated with the Texas Tower 4. In 1960 the Air Force installed an AN/FPS-6B height-finder radar at Highlands which, along with the AN/FPS-6, had been replaced by 1963 with AN/FPS-26A and AN/FPS-90 sets. On July 31, 1963 the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-9. The United States Secretary of Defense announced on 20 November 1964, that the Air Force operations would be closed. The Highlands Army Air Defense Site (HAADS) was established in 1966 with the first Hughes AN/TSQ-51 Air Defense Command and Coordination System in the nation. This replaced the Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense System in the Missile Master nuclear- hardened bunker, which used radar data to guide Nike missiles. HAADS assumed control of the USAF station after the DoD announced its closure for July 1966. The 646th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated on 1 July 1966. The Army's use of the site ended in 1974 under Project Concise when the Nike missile program ended. Most of the buildings were demolished in the mid 1980s and mid 1990s, and a few building foundations remain in a small clearing within the site's overgrowth of vegetation. However, the concrete remains of Battery Lewis, Battery 219, and the Plotting and Switchboard Bunker still stand. Present The area is now Hartshorne Woods Park. In January 2017 a retired US Navy 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun, formerly a spare for the s, was placed on display in one of the gun positions of Battery Lewis.

Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Mona Rockman was probably one of a number of artists who first learned painting through a course run in 1986 at Lajamanu by an adult education officer, John Quinn, associated with the local Technical and Further Education unit. The course, initially attended only by men, eventually enrolled over a hundred community members. Others who began their careers through that course include Louisa Napaljarri, as well as Mona's sister Peggy Rockman. Western Desert artists such as Mona will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights. Mona's dreamings are Ngatijiiri (budgerigar) and Warna (snake). In addition to painting, Mona has also worked in pottery, with her work in both media being exhibited by the National Gallery of Victoria.

Racial attacks during campaign Since announcing his candidacy, Steele had been the target of attacks that he says are racially tinged. A blog run by a Steve Gilliard, a politically liberal African-American, depicted Steele as a blackface minstrel. Tim Kaine, the Democratic Governor of Virginia, subsequently pulled all his ads from the blog. Stem cell comparison When discussing his position on embryonic stem cells before Jewish leaders on February 9, 2006, Steele compared the science with experiments performed on Jews during the Holocaust and with slavery, saying, \\"(Y)ou of all folks know what happens when people decide they want to experiment on human beings.... I know that as well in my community, out of our experience with slavery, and so I'm very cautious when people say this is the best new thing, this is going to save lives.\\" Art Abramson, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council, criticized Steele for his remarks, rejecting the comparison \\"between ethical and lifesaving medical research, and the horrors committed by the Nazis in their evil drive to create a master race.\\" Cardin, who is Jewish and a supporter of embryonic stem-cell research, also criticized Steele. DSCC credit report incident Staffers of the DSCC illegally obtained a copy of Steele's credit report during the campaign. Researcher Lauren Weiner used Steele's SSN to obtain his credit report from TransUnion. Weiner used Research Director Katie Barge's DSCC credit card to pay for the report. After an internal investigation, the Maryland Democratic Party determined the credit report was obtained illegally, and reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney. Weiner pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of computer fraud and will do 150 hours of community service. Barge resigned from the DSCC. Steele has commented upon the incident: \\"It is a stain on the entire organization and the operations of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. It's the kind of politics that turns people off and demeans the electoral process.\\" Steele used the incident in a fund-raising mailing and attack ads against Ben Cardin. Steele stated in the fund-raising letter \\"from stealing my credit report to endless personal attacks, Congressman Ben Cardin just can't seem to have a real debate on the issues...\\" In the TV ad, Steele said \\"Ben Cardin's team hacks into my credit report...\\". Cardin responded \\"and Michael Steele knows this – there is no connection whatsoever with the [credit report] episode and [me] or my campaign.\\" Campaign website In July 2006, Steele posted photographs on his website that included him with prominent local and national Democrats from events where Steele appeared as the Lieutenant Governor, not as a candidate, without their permission. The posting came under criticism from the local party and Steny Hoyer (D-5th), and Steele removed the photos. The Maryland Democratic Party started its own website with photographs of Steele with Republicans unpopular in the state. Martin Luther King, Jr. advertisement In September 2006, an advertisement run by the National Black Republican Association in support of Steele generated controversy for its claims. For example, it claimed that Martin Luther King, Jr., was a Republican. The ad also accused Democrats in general of opposing civil rights legislation and releasing \\"vicious dogs and fire hoses on blacks.\\" After hearing the ad for himself, Steele disavowed it and asked that it be pulled from the air. Cardin staffer blogging On September 16, 2006, Cardin's campaign fired a staffer who had maintained a blog about her experiences within the campaign. In addition to revealing details about the campaign, some of the blog entries contained racial and ethnic slurs. For example, some entries discussed the hypersensitivity of the campaign to racial issues, claiming that a black staffer on the campaign was able to keep his job solely due to playing \\"the racism card\\". In another entry, the staffer expressed her belief that she was a \\"sex object\\" for Jewish friends of Cardin, whom she described as having \\"Jewish noses.\\"John Fritze, Baltimore Sun, \\"Cardin campaign staffer fired over racial blog posts\\", September 17, 2006. Although the Cardin campaign maintained it was a \\"junior staffer,\\" some bloggers revealed that the staffer was Ursula Gruber, a regional director in charge of other workers in the campaign. Handing out misleading voter guides On November 7, 2006, Bob Ehrlich's gubernatorial re-election campaign and Michael Steele's Maryland senatorial campaign recruited seven busloads of homeless Philadelphians to distribute misleading voter guides in Maryland. Each \\"official voter guide\\", headlined \\"Democratic Sample Ballot\\", had boxes checked beside Ehrlich's and Steele's names and those of Democratic candidates in other races, with photos of black Democratic leaders on the front. The fliers were handed out to mostly poor and black voters in Prince George's County in Maryland. Workers said that first lady Kendel Ehrlich personally gave them T-shirts and hats and thanked them. However, Ehrlich claimed to be unaware that these workers were hired from Philadelphia. The campaign tactic was widely criticized by Democrats for confusing and misleading voters.Ernesto Londono, \\"Sample Ballots in Pr. George's Misidentify Candidates\\", Washington Post, November 7, 2006Matthew Mosk and Avis Thomas-Lester, \\"GOP Fliers Apparently Were Part Of Strategy: Md. Tactics Similar To Ones in 2002\\", Washington Post, November 13, 2006 Election-eve campaign mailers On November 6, 2006, the day before the general election, Gov. Ehrlich's and Lt. Gov. Steele's campaigns mailed a flier to a number of Prince George's County residents. The flier, a self-proclaimed \\"Ehrlich-Steele Democrats Official Voter Guide,\\" was a sample ballot endorsing Ehrlich and Steele alongside numerous Democratic politicians. The front cover of the mailer featured pictures of several current and former Democratic candidates for public office, with the text, \\"These Are Our Choices.\\" Many Democrats criticized the mailer as misleading, as it could imply that Ehrlich and Steele were Democrats. (The text on the back of the mailer encouraged Democrats to vote for Republican candidates, but the sample ballot itself made no mention of the candidates' party affiliations.) Others, including Kweisi Mfume and Jack B. Johnson said that the featuring of three Prince George's County Democrats on the front of the mailer suggested that they all had endorsed Ehrlich and Steele, which was not the case.  Alleged misuse of campaign funds  In 2009, it became known that Steele's former finance chairman, Alan B. Fabian, had reported to federal prosecutors that Steele used his 2006 Senate campaign fund to pay a by-then-defunct company, Brown Sugar Unlimited run by his sister, for \\"catering/web services\\" that were allegedly never performed. Fabian provided the information to federal prosecutors in 2008 during his plea negotiations on unrelated fraud charges (for which he was sentenced to 9 years in prison). On February 7, 2009, Steele, through a spokesman, said that the payments to his sister \\"were fully disclosed and are completely proper and in full compliance with all state and federal laws.\\" In March 2009, Jayne Miller of WBAL Baltimore 11 reported that Steele's Senate campaign made four payments for \\"political consulting\\" in October and November 2006 to the company Allied Berton, totaling more than $64,000; the company also received more than $350,000 during the same period from campaign committees controlled by Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich and the Maryland Republican party. Allied Berton's business, according to its website, was trading commodities, such as minerals, metals, coffee and sugar. According to Miller's report, the owner of the firm, Sandy Roberts, hosted a tribute to Michael Steele in New York during the 2004 Republican National Convention and was the beneficiary of an Ehrlich- Steele administration action which paved the way for a multiple-outlet retail concession at Baltimore Washington International Airport. A Steele spokesman said only that his campaign complied with all Federal Election Commission regulations.

Ed. Pjatrus Broǔka. Minsk: Byelorussian Soviet Encyclopedia, 1982. His career as a professional soldier in the Soviet armed forces began during the Russian Civil War (1917–1923). Already a member of the Bolsheviks’ Red Guard during the revolutionary events of 1917, Kamera joined the Bolshevik Party and the newly organized Red Army of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic in 1918.Parrish, Michael. Sacrifice of the Generals: Soviet Senior Officer Losses, 1939-1953. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004. , . P. 151. A professional military man during the interwar decades in the Soviet Union, Kamera served in the artillery of the Red Army in the Soviet Union's Far East during 1929. He finished a set of army commanders' tactical courses in 1936 and held a series of artillery commands in the Soviet Army's divisions and corps in the 1930s. He was assigned the army rank of major-general of the artillery following the introduction of the general officer ranks into the Soviet military ranks in 1940. In World War II Initially the commanding artillery officer of the Red Army's 10th Rifle Corps during peacetime in 1941, Kamera was assigned to a series of commands in the Red Army's artillery following the June 1941 surprise invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany. As chief commander of the artillery within the 19th Army of the Soviet Union in July 1941, Kamera lost contact with the 19th Army during operations near Smolensk, but succeeded in assisting Konstantin Rokossovsky's improvized counterattack against the advancing forces of Germany's Army Group Center at the heights of Yartsevo in Smolensk Oblast. The successful counterattack temporarily retook control of the town from the German forces. Subsequently, appointed chief commanding officer of the artillery for the Soviet Union's Western Front in November 1941, Kamera served under Front commanders Georgy Zhukov (1941–1942) and Ivan Konev (1942–1943). Awarded the rank of colonel- general on 5 July 1943, he served under Vasily Sokolovsky (1943–1944) until mid-April 1944just prior to the Front's 1944 reorganization as the 2nd and 3rd Belorussian Fronts. Rokossovsky, recalling his experience with Kamera during the handling of the artillery at Yartsevo in his later memoirs, described Kamera as a remarkable commander; Soviet Artillery Marshal Nikolay Voronov also set down fond recollections, describing Kamera as a demanding commander regarded as a genuine authority by the artillerymen working under him.Rokossovsky, Konstantin Konstantinovich. \\"Солдатский долг\\" (A Soldier's Duty). Moscow: Olma Media Group, 2002. , . P. 60.Voronov, N. N. \\"На службе военной\\" (On Military Duty). Moscow: Voyenizdat, 1963. P. 382. Kamera also became one of the higher-ranking Soviet Army officers to be decorated for heroism by the United States, receiving the United States Department of War's Distinguished Service Cross on behalf of Commander-in-Chief President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 6 January 1944.\\"Valor Awards for Ivan Kamera\\". Military Times Hall of Valor. Military Times. 2009. Retrieved 12 January 2009. Kamera was not as positively regarded by other military leadersparticularly as the Western Front failed to make significant advances for multiple months during the Soviet Army's pushback in 1943–1944. A joint report from the State Defense Committee, composed of Georgy Malenkov, colonel-generals Shcherbakov and Sergei Shtemenko, and lieutenant-generals Kuznetsov and , delivered to Joseph Stalin on 11 April 1944, criticized several generals and specifically faulted the performance of the artillery forces under Kamera's commandrecommending his demotion in rank and replacement as artillery commander by another officer. Sokolovsky, Kamera, and other personnel were promptly relieved of their commands.Borisenko, N. S. \\"Девятимесячное стояние фронта на р. Проня в 1943-1944 гг.

His wartime career was effectively over in such circumstances. Kamera died on 21 January 1952.

The Fulgur made its first flight on 5 March 1936, and soon displayed a maximum speed of , leading it to be described as the fastest commercial transport in the world. Operational history The prototype Breguet 470 was entered in the 1936 Paris–Saigon–Paris race, with the hope of winning a large cash prize (1,800,000 Francs), and a promise that the winner would be purchased by the French Air Ministry.

It is generally regarded as beginning in 1971 with a painting movement that started at Papunya, northwest of Alice Springs, Northern Territory, involving Aboriginal artists such as Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri and Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, and facilitated by white Australian teacher and art worker Geoffrey Bardon. The movement spawned widespread interest across rural and remote Aboriginal Australia in creating art, while contemporary Indigenous art of a different nature also emerged in urban centres; together they have become central to Australian art. Indigenous art centres have fostered the emergence of the contemporary art movement, and as of 2010 were estimated to represent over 5000 artists, mostly in Australia's north and west. Contemporary Indigenous artists have won many of Australia's most prominent art prizes. The Wynne Prize has been won by Indigenous artists on at least three occasions, the Blake Prize for Religious Art was in 2007 won by Shirley Purdie with Linda Syddick Napaltjarri a finalist on three separate occasions, while the Clemenger Contemporary Art Award was won by John Mawurndjul in 2003 and Judy Watson in 2006. There is a national art prize for Indigenous artists, the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, which in 2013 was won by Jenni Kemarre Martiniello from Canberra. Indigenous artists, including Rover Thomas, have represented Australia at the Venice Biennale in 1990 and 1997. In 2007, a painting by Emily Kngwarreye, Earth's Creation, was the first Indigenous Australian art work to sell for more than million. Leading Indigenous artists have had solo exhibitions at Australian and international galleries, while their work has been included in major collaborations such as the design of the Musée du quai Branly. Works by contemporary Indigenous artists are held by all of Australia's major public galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia, which in 2010 opened a new wing dedicated to its Indigenous collection. The figurative \\"dot painting\\" produced by Western Desert artists is among the most well-known styles of contemporary Aboriginal art. Origins and evolution Indigenous Australian art can claim to be \\"the world’s longest continuing art tradition\\". Prior to European settlement of Australia, Indigenous people used many art forms, including sculpture, wood carving, rock carving, body painting, bark painting and weaving. Many of these continue to be used both for traditional purposes and in the creation of art works for exhibition and sale. Some other techniques have declined or disappeared since European settlement, including body decoration by scarring and the making of possum-skin cloaks. However, Indigenous Australians also adopted and expanded the use of new techniques including painting on paper and canvas.M Ruth Megaw and JVS Megaw, 'Art', in Horton (1994), p. 60. Early examples include the late nineteenth century drawings by William Barak.Ryan, Cooper and Murphy-Wandin (2003). Early initiatives Albert Namatjira, right, with portraitist William Dargie In the 1930s, artists Rex Battarbee and John Gardner introduced watercolour painting to Albert Namatjira, an Indigenous man at Hermannsberg Mission, south-west of Alice Springs. His landscape paintings, first created in 1936Morphy (1999), p. 264. and exhibited in Australian cities in 1938, were immediately successful,McCulloch (2006), p. 4. and he became the first Indigenous Australian watercolourist as well as the first to successfully exhibit and sell his works to the non-Indigenous community.J.V.S. Megaw and M. Ruth Megaw, 'Painting country: The Arrernte watercolour artists of Hermannsburg', in Kleinert and Neale (2000), p. 199. Namatjira's style of work was adopted by other Indigenous artists in the region beginning with his close male relatives, and they became known as the Hermannsburg SchoolMorphy (1999), p. 265. or as the Arrernte Watercolourists.J.V.S. Megaw and M. Ruth Megaw, 'Painting country: The Arrernte watercolour artists of Hermannsburg', in Kleinert and Neale (2000), pp. 200–204. Namatjira died in 1959, and by then a second initiative had also begun. At Ernabella, now Pukatja, South Australia, the use of bright acrylic paints to produce designs for posters and postcards was introduced. This led later to fabric design and batik work, which is still produced at Australia's oldest Indigenous art centre. Origin While the initiatives at Hermannsburg and Ernabella were important antecedents, most sources trace the origins of contemporary Indigenous art, particularly acrylic painting, to Papunya, Northern Territory, in 1971.McCulloch (2006), p. 7.John Kean, 'Papunya, place and time', in Johnson (2007), p. 7.Vivien Johnson, 'Desert Art', in Kleinert and Neale (2000), p. 212. An Australian school teacher, Geoffrey Bardon arrived at Papunya and started an art program with children at the school and then with the men of the community. The men began with painting a mural on the school walls, and moved on to painting on boards and canvas. At the same time, Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, a member of the community who worked with Bardon, won a regional art award at Alice Springs with his painting Gulgardi. Soon over 20 men at Papunya were painting, and they established their own company, Papunya Tula Artists Limited, to support the creation and marketing of works. Although painting took hold quickly at Papunya, it remained a \\"small-scale regional phenomenon\\" throughout the 1970s,John Kean, 'Papunya, place and time', in Johnson (2007), p. 15. and for a decade none of the state galleries or the national gallery collected the works,McCulloch (2006), p. 8. with the notable exception of the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, that acquired 220 of the early Papunya boards. Evolution After being largely confined to Papunya in the 1970s, the painting movement developed rapidly in the 1980s, spreading to Yuendumu, Lajamanu, Utopia and Haasts Bluff in the Northern Territory, and Balgo, Western Australia. By the 1990s artistic activity had spread to many communities throughout northern Australia, including those established as part of the Outstation movement, such as Kintore, Northern Territory and Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia.McCulloch (2006), p. 13. As the movement evolved, not all artists were satisfied with its trajectory. What began as a contemporary expression of ritual knowledge and identity was increasingly becoming commodified, as the economic success of painting created its own pressures within communities. Some artists were critical of the art centre workers, and moved away from painting, returning their attention to ritual. Other artists were producing works less connected to social networks that had been traditionally responsible for designs. While the movement was evolving, however, its growth did not slow: at least another 10 painting communities developed in central Australia between the late 1990s and 2006.McCulloch (2006), p. 14. Indigenous art cooperatives have been central to the emergence of contemporary Indigenous art. Whereas many western artists pursue formal training and work as individuals, most contemporary Indigenous art is created in community groups and art centres.Wright, Felicity and Morphy, Frances (1999–2000). The Art & Craft Centre Story. Canberra: ATSIC (3 vols). In 2010, the peak body representing central Australian Indigenous art centres, Desart, had 44 member centres, while the Association of Northern, Kimberley and Arnhem Aboriginal Artists (ANKAAA), the peak body for northern Australian communities, had 43 member centres. The centres represent large numbers of artists – ANKAAA estimated that in 2010 its member organisations included up to 5000. The number of people involved, and the small sizes of the places in which they work, mean that sometimes a quarter to a half of community members are artists, with critic Sasha Grishin concluding that the communities include \\"the highest per capita concentrations of artists anywhere in the world\\". Styles and themes Aboriginal Memorial by Ramingining artists from Arnhem Land Indigenous art frequently reflects the spiritual traditions, cultural practices and socio-political circumstances of Indigenous people,Thomas (1999), p. 166. and these have varied across the country. The works of art accordingly differ greatly from place to place. Major reference works on Australian Indigenous art often discuss works by geographical region.See for example, Kleinert & Neale (2000); Caruana (2003); McCulloch & McCulloch Childs (2008); Cubillo & Caruana (2010). The usual groupings are of art from the Central Australian desert; the Kimberley in Western Australia; the northern regions of the Northern Territory, particularly Arnhem Land, often referred to as the Top End; and northern Queensland, including the Torres Strait Islands. Urban art is also generally treated as a distinct style of Indigenous art, though it is not clearly geographically defined. Desert art Indigenous artists from remote central Australia, particularly the central and western desert area, frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights.Johnson (1994), pp. 7–12. Best known amongst these are the works of the Papunya Tula painters and of Utopia artist Emily Kngwarreye. The patterns portrayed by central Australian artists, such as those from Papunya, originated as translations of traditional motifs marked out in sand, boards or incised into rock.McCulloch (2006), p. 10. The symbols used in designs may represent place, movement, or people and animals, while dot fields may indicate a range of phenomena such as sparks, clouds or rain.Caruana (2003), p. 103. There are some figurative approaches in the art of those of central Australia, such as among some of the painters from Balgo, Western Australia. Some central Australian artists whose people were displaced from their lands in the mid-twentieth century by nuclear weapon tests have painted works that use traditional painting techniques but also portray the effects of the blasts on their country. =APY lands= Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara, in remote north-western South Australia, is renowned for its artists, who are always well-represented in any exhibitions and awards for Indigenous Australian artists. In 2017, APY artists earned 25 nominations in the prestigious Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards; two were named as finalists in the Archibald Prize; 14 APY artists' work made the shortlist for the 2019 Wynne Prize for landscape painting; and in 2019, APY artists also won or were shortlisted for the Ramsay Art Prize, the Sir John Sulman Prize, the John Fries Award, and others. Nici Cumpston, artistic director of Tarnanthi Festival at Art Gallery of South Australia, regularly visits the APY art centres. The APY Art Centre Collective is a group of ten Indigenous-owned and -governed enterprises which supports artists from across the Lands and helps to market their work. The collective supports collaborative regional projects, such as the renowned Kulata Tjuta project, and the APY Photography initiative. Seven art centres across the Lands support the work of more than 500 Anangu artists, from the oldest one, Ernabella Arts, to Iwantja Arts at Indulkana, whose residents include award- winning Vincent Namatjira. Other APY centres are Tjala Arts (at Amata), Kaltjiti Arts, Mimili Maku Arts and Tjungu Palya (Nyapari). As well as the APY centres, Maruku Arts from Uluru, Tjanpi Desert Weavers based in Alice Springs, and Ara Iritja Aboriginal Corporation bring the number up to ten. The Collective has galleries in Darlinghurst, Sydney and, since May 2019, a gallery and studio space on Light Square (Wauwi) in Adelaide. The Top End In Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, men have painted their traditional clan designs.M Ruth Megaw and JVS Megaw, 'Art', in Horton (1994), p. 63. The iconography however is quite separate and distinct from that of central Australia.Caruana (2003), pp. 102–103. In north Queensland and the Torres Strait many communities continue to practice cultural artistic traditions along with voicing strong political and social messages in their work. Urban art In Indigenous communities across northern Australia most artists have no formal training, their work being based instead on traditional knowledge and skills. In southeast Australia other Indigenous artists, often living in the cities, have trained in art schools and universities.Morphy (1999), p. 378. These artists are frequently referred to as \\"urban\\" Indigenous artists, although the term is sometimes controversial,Morphy (1999), p. 380. and does not accurately describe the origins of some of these individuals, such as Bronwyn Bancroft who grew up in the town of Tenterfield, New South Wales, Michael Riley who came from rural New South Wales near Dubbo and Moree,Brenda Croft, 'Up in the sky, behind the clouds', in Croft (2006). or Lin Onus who spent time on his father's traditional country on the Murray River near Victoria's Barmah forest. Some, like Onus, were self-taught while others, such as artist Danie Mellor or artist and curator Brenda Croft, completed university studies in fine arts. Media Bronwyn Bancroft, Sydney- based artist who has worked in a wide range of media including textiles, painting and sculpture Anthropologist Nicholas Thomas observed that contemporary Indigenous art practice was perhaps unique in how \\"wholly new media were adapted so rapidly to produce work of such palpable strength\\".Thomas (1999), p. 198. Much contemporary Indigenous art is produced using acrylic paint on canvas. However other materials and techniques are in use, often in particular regions. Bark painting predominates amongst artists from Arnhem Land, who also undertake carving and weaving.McCulloch (2006), p. 9. In central Australian communities associated with the Pitjantjatjara people, pokerwork carving is significant.Morphy (1999), p. 285. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander printmaking was in 2011 described by the National Gallery's senior curator of prints and drawings as \\"the most significant development in recent printmaking history\\". Textile production including batik has been important in the northwestern desert regions of South Australia, in the Northern Territory's Utopia community, and in other areas of central Australia. For a decade before commencing the painting career that would make her famous, Emily Kngwarreye was creating batik designs that revealed her \\"prodigious original talent\\" and the modernity of her artistic vision.Judith Ryan, 'Prelude to canvas: batik cadenzas wax lyrical', in Ryan (2008), p. 17. A wide range of textile art techniques, including dyeing and weaving, is particularly associated with Pukatja, South Australia (formerly known as Ernabella), but in the mid-2000s the community also developed a reputation for fine sgraffito ceramics.Caruana (2003), p. 108.Rothwell (2007), pp. 239–242. Hermannsburg, originally home to Albert Namatjira and the Arrente Watercolourists, is now renowned for its pottery.Morphy (1999), p. 279. Amongst urban Indigenous artists, more diverse techniques are in use such as silkscreen printing, poster making, photography, television and film. One of the most important contemporary Indigenous artists of his generation, Michael Riley worked in film, video, still photography and digital media.Linda Burney, 'Introduction', in Croft (2006). Likewise, Bronwyn Bancroft has worked in fabric, textiles, \\"jewellery design, painting, collage, illustration, sculpture and interior decoration\\".McCulloch (2006), p. 34. Nevertheless, painting remains a medium used by many 'urban' artists, such as Gordon Bennett, Fiona Foley, Trevor Nickolls, Lin Onus, Judy Watson, and Harry Wedge.Morphy (1999), pp. 382–406. Exhibitions and collections National Gallery of Australia's extension, completed in 2010, which houses a representative collection of Indigenous art, including the Aboriginal Memorial (above) The public recognition and exhibition of contemporary Indigenous art was initially very limited: for example, it was only a minor part of the collection of Australia's national gallery when its building was opened in 1982. Early exhibitions of major works were held as part of the Sydney Biennales of 1979 and 1982, while a large-scale sand painting was a feature of the 1981 Sydney Festival.Mundine, Djon, 'Save Your Pity: Masterworks of the Western Desert', in Murphy (2009), pp. 168–169. Early private gallery showings of contemporary Indigenous art included a solo exhibition of bark paintings by Johnny Bulunbulun at Hogarth Gallery in Sydney in 1981, and an exhibition of western desert artists at Gallery A in Sydney, which formed part of the 1982 Sydney Festival. There are a number of regular exhibitions devoted to contemporary Indigenous art. Since 1984, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award exhibition has been held in the Northern Territory, under the auspices of the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. In 2007, the National Gallery of Australia held the first National Indigenous Art Triennial (NIAT), titled unDISCLOSED, which included works by thirty contemporary Indigenous artists such as Richard Bell, Danie Mellor, Doreen Reid Nakamarra and Shane Pickett.Croft (2007). Despite its name, the second triennial was not held until 2012, and was titled unDisclosed. The third Triennial, Defying Empire, was held in 2017, with the title referencing the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum. The Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment, a public art gallery in Alice Springs, hosts the annual Desert Mob exhibition, representing current painting activities across Australia's Aboriginal art centres. Several individual artists have been the subject of retrospective exhibitions at public galleries. These have included Rover Thomas at the National Gallery of Australia in 1994, Emily Kngwarreye, at the Queensland Art Gallery in 1998, John Mawurndjul at the Tinguely Museum in Basel, Switzerland in 2005, and Paddy Bedford at several galleries including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney in 2006–07.Bedford and Storer (2006). Internationally, Indigenous artists have represented Australia in the Venice Biennale, including Rover Thomas and Trevor Nickolls in 1990, and Emily Kngwarreye, Judy Watson and Yvonne Koolmatrie in 1997.Myer, 'Chairman's Foreword', in Croft (2007), p. viii. In 2000, a number of individual artists and artistic collaborations were shown in the prestigious Nicholas Hall at the Hermitage Museum in Russia. In 2003, eight Indigenous artists – Paddy Bedford, John Mawurndjul, Ningura Napurrula, Lena Nyadbi, Michael Riley, Judy Watson, Tommy Watson and Gulumbu Yunupingu – collaborated on a commission to provide works that decorate one of the Musée du quai Branly's four buildings completed in 2006. Contemporary Indigenous art works are collected by all of Australia's major public galleries. The National Gallery of Australia has a significant collection, and a new wing was (pictured) opened in 2010 for its permanent exhibition. Some state galleries, such as the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, have gallery space permanently dedicated to the exhibition of contemporary indigenous art. The National Gallery of Victoria's collection includes the country's main collection of indigenous batik. The Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment hosts the country's largest collection of works by Albert Namatjira. Galleries outside Australia acquiring contemporary indigenous art include the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Permanent displays of indigenous art outside Australia are found at Seattle Art Museum, Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art and the Kluge–Ruhe Museum at the University of Virginia.Genocchio (2008), p. 15. Prizes Contemporary indigenous art works have won a number of Australia's principal national art prizes, including the Wynne Prize, the Clemenger Contemporary Art Award and the Blake Prize for Religious Art. Indigenous awardees have included Shirley Purdie, 2007 winner of the Blake Prize with her work Stations of the Cross; 2003 Clemenger Award winner John Mawurndjul, and 2006 Clemenger winner Judy Watson. The Wynne Prize has been won by contemporary Indigenous artists on several occasions, including in 1999 by Gloria Petyarre with Leaves; in 2004 by George Tjungurrayi; and in 2008 by Joanne Currie Nalingu, with her painting The river is calm. As well as winning major prizes, indigenous artists have been well represented among the finalists in these competitions. The Blake Prize has included numerous Indigenous finalists, such as Bronwyn Bancroft (2008), Angelina Ngal and Irene (Mbitjana) Entata (2009), Genevieve Kemarr Loy, Cowboy Loy Pwerl, Dinni Kunoth Kemarre, Elizabeth Kunoth Kngwarray (2010), and Linda Syddick Napaltjarri (on three separate occasions).Johnson (1994), p. 188. Australia's major indigenous art prize is the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Established by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in 1984, the award includes a major winner that receives A$40,000, and five category awards each worth $4000: one for bark painting, one for works on paper, one for three-dimensional works and, introduced for the first time in 2010, one for new media. Winners of the major prize have included Makinti Napanangka in 2008, and Danie Mellor in 2009. In 2008, the Art Gallery of Western Australia established the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards, which include the country's most valuable indigenous art cash prize of A$50,000, as well as a A$10,000 prize for the top Western Australian artist, and a A$5000 People's Choice Award, all selected from the field of finalists, which includes 15 individuals and one collaborative group. The 2009 winner of the main prize was Ricardo Idagi, while the People's Choice award was won by Shane Pickett. Wayne Quilliam was awarded the 2009 NAIDOC Artist of the Year for his many years of work on the local and international scene working with indigenous groups throughout the world. Benefits and costs The flowering of indigenous art has delivered economic, social and cultural benefits to indigenous Australians, who are socially and economically disadvantaged compared to the Australian community as a whole.Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee (2007), pp. 19–26. The sale of art works is a significant economic activity for individual artists and for their communities. Estimates of the size of the sector vary, but placed its value in the early 2000s at A$100 to 300 million, and by 2007 at half a billion dollars and growing.Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee (2007), p. 16. The sector is particularly important to many indigenous communities because, as well being a source of cash for an economically disadvantaged group, it reinforces indigenous identity and tradition, and has aided the maintenance of social cohesion.M. Ruth Megaw and JVS Megaw, 'Art', in Horton (1994), p. 64. For example, early works painted at Papunya were created by senior Aboriginal men to help educate younger generations about their culture and their cultural responsibilities.Vivien Johnson, 'Desert art', in Kleinert and Neale (2000), p. 213. Fraud and exploitation are significant issues affecting contemporary indigenous Australian art. Indigenous art works have regularly been reproduced without artists' permission, including by the Reserve Bank of Australia when it used a David Malangi painting on the one dollar note in 1966.Djon Mundine, 'Some people are stories', in Jenkins (2004), pp. 28–41. Similar appropriation of material has taken place with fabric designs, T-shirts and carpets.Morphy (1999), p. 416. There have been claims of artists being kidnapped, or relocated against the wishes of their families, by people keen to acquire the artists' paintings. Artists, particularly in the remoter parts of Australia, sometimes paint for outlets other than the indigenous art centres or their own companies. They do this for economic reasons, however the resulting paintings can be of uneven quality, and of precarious economic value. Doubts about the provenance of indigenous paintings, and about the prices paid for them, have spawned media scrutiny, an Australian parliamentary inquiry,Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee (2007), p. 97. and have been a factor limiting the growth in value of works. Questions regarding the authenticity of works have arisen in relation to particular artists, including Emily Kngwarreye, Rover Thomas, Kathleen Petyarre, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, Ginger Riley Munduwalawala, and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri; in 2001 an art dealer was jailed for fraud in relation to Clifford Possum's work.McCulloch (2006), p. 11. These pressures led in 2009 to the introduction of a commercial code of conduct, intended to establish \\"minimum standards of practice and fair dealing in the Indigenous visual arts industry\\". However, persistent problems in the industry in September 2012 led the chair of the code's administering body Indigenous Art Code, Ron Merkel, to call for the code to be made mandatory for art dealers. Prices fetched in the secondary market for indigenous art works vary widely. Until 2007, the record at auction for an indigenous art work was $778,750 paid in 2003 for a Rover Thomas painting, All That Big Rain Coming from the Top Side. In 2007, a major work by Emily Kngwarreye, Earth's Creation, sold for $1.056 million, a new record that was however eclipsed only a few months later, when Clifford Possum's epic work Warlugulong was bought for $2.4 million by the National Gallery of Australia. At the same time, however, works by prominent artists but of doubtful provenance were being passed in at auctions. In 2003 there were 97 indigenous Australian artists whose works were being sold at auction in Australia for prices above $5000, with the total auction market worth around $9.5 million. In that year Sotheby's estimated that half of sales were to bidders outside Australia. By 2012, the market had changed, with older works fetching higher prices than contemporary paintings. A 2011 change in Australian superannuation investment rules resulted in a sharp decline in sales of new indigenous art. The change prohibits assets acquired for a self- managed superannuation fund from being \\"used\\" before retirement; in particular, an artwork must be kept in storage rather than displayed. Assessment Professor of art history Ian McLean described the birth of the contemporary indigenous art movement in 1971 as \\"the most fabulous moment in Australian art history\\", and considered that it was becoming one of Australia's founding myths, like the ANZAC spirit. Art historian Wally Caruana called indigenous art \\"the last great tradition of art to be appreciated by the world at large\\",Caruana (2003), p. 7. and contemporary indigenous art is the only art movement of international significance to emerge from Australia.Michael Pickering, 'Sand, seed, hair and paint', in Johnson (2007), p. 1. Leading critic Robert Hughes saw it as \\"the last great art movement of the 20th century\\", while poet Les Murray thought of it as \\"Australia's equivalent of jazz\\".Les Murray, 'Responses', in Greer (2004), p. 140. Paintings by the artists of the western desert in particular have quickly achieved \\"an extraordinarily widespread reputation\\", with collectors competing to obtain them.Morphy (1999), pp. 315–316. Some indigenous artists are regarded as amongst Australia's foremost creative talent; Emily Kngwarreye has been described as \\"one of the greatest modern Australian painters\\",McCulloch (2006), p. 88. and \\"among the best Australian artists, arguably amongst the best of her time.\\"Terry Smith, 'Kngwarreye Woman, Abstract Painter', in Emily Kngwarreye – Paintings, p. 24. Critics reviewing the Hermitage Museum exhibition in 2000 were fulsome in their praise, one remarking: \\"This is an exhibition of contemporary art, not in the sense that it was done recently, but in that it is cased in the mentality, technology and philosophy of radical art of the most recent times. No one, other than the Aborigines of Australia, has succeeded in exhibiting such art at the Hermitage\\". The assessments have not been universally favourable. When an exhibition was held in the United Kingdom in 1993, a reviewer in The Independent described the works as \\"perhaps the most boring art in the world\\".Cited in Museum curator Philip Batty, who had been involved in assisting the creation and sale of art in central Australia, expressed concern at the effect of the non-indigenous art market on the artists – particularly Emily Kngwarreye – and their work. He wrote \\"there was always a danger that the European component of this cross-cultural partnership would become overly dominant. By the end of her brief career, I think that Emily had all but evacuated this intercultural domain, and her work simply became a mirror image of European desires\\". Outstanding art works are mixed with poor ones, with the passage of time yet to filter the good from the bad. Initially a source of ethnographic interest, and later an artistic movement with roots outside Western art traditions, indigenous art was influenced by, and had influence upon, few European Australian artists. The early works of Margaret Preston sometimes expressed motifs from traditional indigenous art; her later works show a deeper influence, \\"in the use of colours, in the interplay of figuration and abstraction in the formal structure\\". In contrast, Hans Heysen, though he admired fellow landscapist Albert Namatjira and collected his paintings, was not influenced by his indigenous counterpart. The contemporary indigenous art movement has influenced some non-indigenous Australian artists through collaborative projects. Indigenous artists Gordon Bennett and Michael Nelson Jagamarra have engaged in both collaborative artworks and exhibitions with gallerist Michael Eather, and painter Imants Tillers, the Australian-born son of Latvian refugees. The Australian Research Council and Land & Water Australia supported an artistic and archaeological collaboration through the project Strata: Deserts Past, Present and Future, which involved indigenous artists Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri and Molly Jugadai Napaltjarri.

Historically, the island, which is now a U.S. territory, has been dominated by a settler society of religiously and ethnically diverse Europeans, primarily of Spanish descent, and Sub-Saharan Africans. The majority of Puerto Ricans are multiracial, including people of European, African, Asian, Native American, and of mixed-race descent.Jose Lee-Borges. Los Chinos en Puerto Rico. Second Edition. San Juan, Puerto Rico: Ediciones Callejon. 2016. pp. 17-18. History Before the first major influx of West Africans into Puerto Rico in the 16th century, Spanish colonizers forced the Taíno natives \\"into slavery, exploiting their labor in the gold mines and on plantations.\\" After nearly a century of exploitation, enslavement, murder, and decline of the Taíno people, Spanish colonizers looked to a new source of slave labor. In 1598 they signed their first contract to bring a large number of West Africans to Puerto Rico. Gold mines, ginger plantations and sugar plantations heavily relied on the slave work from the Taíno and West Africans. Since the majority of the European and African colonizers and enslaved laborers arrived without women, intermarriage often occurred with the remaining Taíno women. The offspring from these interracial relationships created a population of Mulattos and Mestizos. When the gold mines were declared depleted in 1570 and mining came to an end in Puerto Rico, the vast majority of the white Spanish settlers left the island to seek their fortunes in the richer colonies, such as Mexico, and the island became a Spanish garrison. The majority of those who stayed behind were either black or mulatto. The next major wave of West African slaves into Puerto Rico came after The Royal Decree of Graces of 1789, which allowed Spanish subjects in the Caribbean to participate in the business of slave trade and labor, particular importing slaves from the Gold Coast. By the time Spain reestablished her commercial ties with Puerto Rico, the island had a large multiracial population. Those demographics, though, changed during the 19th century when the Spanish Crown issued the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 which also resulted in \\"whitening\\" Puerto Rico's population from its offering of land, agricultural, and labor incentives to non-Hispanic white Europeans. The new arrivals continued to intermarry with the native islanders.African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality by (the late) Dr. Robert A. Martinez, Baruch College., Retrieved July 20, 2007 \\"The Royal census of Puerto Rico in 1834 established that the island's population as 42,000 enslaved Africans, 25,000 colored freemen, 189,000 people who identified themselves as whites and 101,000 who were described as being of mixed ethnicity.\\" A number of slave uprisings in plantations took place between 1820 and 1868. Puerto Rico abolished slavery in 1873. Discrimination During colonization, racial hierarchy was determined by the amount of \\"white blood\\" an individual had. According to the hierarchy, \\"one drop of white blood meant you were white and better than your Black compatriot.\\" The upper classes were composed of white people and their descendants while the lower classes were composed of African slaves and their mulatto offspring. The U.S. invasion in 1898 perpetuated the racial hierarchy and intensified anti Afro-Puerto Rican sentiment. The white upper class made deals with U.S. industrialists and supported U.S. policies in Puerto Rico at the expense of Afro-Puerto Rican civil rights. Despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act of Puerto Rico in 1943, a reporter writing in 1945 on race relations in Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands stated, Revolutionary leaders, including Pedro Albizu Campos, have fought to eliminate the racial discrimination heightened by U.S. imperialism and to place Afro- Puerto Ricans in political positions of power. Recent events In 2019, José Pichy Torres Zamora, a Puerto Rican politician was taken to task for making a racist comment regarding the black people of Loíza. In June 2020, amid the worldwide protests against racism after the Killing of George Floyd, people of the Municipality of Loíza joined in and Juan Dalmau Ramírez, a high-ranking member of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, put forth the need to educate Puerto Rico's children on human rights, and ending racism and xenophobia. The University of Puerto Rico held an online forum on racism and discrimination. During this time as well, a Black family in Canóvanas, filed a cease-and- desist complaint against an 82-year old woman neighbor for alleged Black racial slurs, playing loud music 24x7 directed at their new home, and harassing them with the posting of homemade drawings that included degrading comments about Black people. The woman received a citation from the police for playing loud music and was summoned to Court to answer to the other complaints. People also protested in front of the governor's mansion in San Juan. Legacy=Contemporary Demographics The current Puerto Rican population reflects the former immigration policy of 1815 spearheaded by the Spanish government in the 19th century, with hundreds of immigrants arriving from Corsica, France, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, Italy, and Portugal, as well as Arabs from Lebanon. Until 1950 the U.S. Bureau of the Census attempted to quantify the racial composition of the island's population, while experimenting with various racial taxonomies. In 1960 the Census dropped the racial identification question for Puerto Rico but included it again in the year 2000 census. The only category that remained constant over time was white, even as other racial labels shifted greatly—from \\"colored\\" to \\"Black,\\" \\"mulatto,\\" and \\"other\\".Regardless of the precise terminology, the Census reported that the bulk of the Puerto Rican population was white from 1899 to 2000.Representation of racial identity among Puerto Ricans and in the U.S. mainland In the 2000 U.S. Census Puerto Ricans were asked to choose which racial category they self-identified with. The breakdown was follows: white (mostly Spanish origin) 80.5%, black 8%, Amerindian 0.4%, Asian 0.2%, mixed and other 10.9%.

She is a member of Regia Anglorum, a medieval reenactment organisation. Biography Elizabeth Chadwick was born in Bury, Lancashire in 1957. She moved with her family to Scotland when she was four years old and spent her childhood in the village of Newton Mearns near Glasgow. She came to Nottingham when she was ten and has lived there ever since. She has told herself stories all of her life, but didn't actually write anything down until she was fifteen. Her first foray into historical fiction, a novel about the Holy Land in the twelfth century, led her to the realisation that she wanted to write historical fiction for a living. In 1989, after years of writing and rejections during which her works won some competitions, a literary agent became interested in The Wild Hunt, one of her books. The book was auctioned to Michael Joseph, part of Penguin Group. A year later the book won a Betty Trask Award, which was presented to the author at Whitehall by the Prince of Wales. Elizabeth Chadwick has gone on to become one of Britain's foremost historical novelists and has been called by the Historical Novel Society \\"the best writer of medieval fiction currently around\\". She is published internationally, and her work has been translated into 16 languages. Chadwick is renowned for her extensive research into the medieval period and particularly so in the area of the Marshal and Bigod families. Her novels about the thirteenth-century magnate William Marshal, The Greatest Knight (2005) and The Scarlet Lion (2006), have brought her international acclaim.

The Haldimand Affair (also called the Haldimand or Vermont Negotiations) was a series of negotiations conducted in the early 1780s (late in the American Revolutionary War) between Frederick Haldimand, the British governor of the Province of Quebec, his agents, and several people representing the independent Vermont Republic. Vermonters had been battling Indian raids, sponsored by the British, and engaged in a long-running dispute with New York State over jurisdiction of the territory. At issue was Vermont officially joining the British. Just as Haldimand offered generous terms for reunion in 1781, the main British army surrendered at Yorktown, and the United States would clearly achieve independence. Vermont, surrounded on three sides by American territory, rejected the British overtures and negotiated terms to enter the United States as the 14th state in March 1791. The secret nature of the negotiations, which excluded significant portions of Vermont's political power structure, led to accusations against some of the negotiators, notably Ethan Allen. Background In 1749, Benning Wentworth, the British provincial governor of New Hampshire, began issuing land grants for territory west of the Connecticut River. This area, now the United States state of Vermont, was also claimed by the Province of New York.Wardner, p. 13 In 1764, King George III issued an order-in-council resolving the territorial dispute in favor of New York.Wardner, p. 49 New York refused to honor the grants issued by Wentworth, who had persisted in issuing grants even after he had agreed to stop issuing them in light of the territorial dispute. Holders of Wentworth's grants, to validate their claims, were effectively required to repurchase their grants at higher prices from New York, to which the land-rich and cash-poor grantees objected. Following a pro forma rejection of the Wentworth grants in 1770 by New York's Supreme Court, which included members who held competing New York grants for some of the territory, the area's settlers, led by Ethan Allen and Seth Warner, formed the Green Mountain Boys and organized resistance to attempts by New York to assert control over the area. Using methods that stopped shy of lethal force, the resistance at times forcibly removed New York's judges, land surveyors, and other figures of provincial authorities and disrupted efforts by holders of New York land grants to settle their lands. The incidents were reaching a critical point when the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775. General Frederick Haldimand, in command of British military forces in New York City, refused to become involved in the dispute.Kingsford, p. 75. Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775, and also participated in the invasion later that year of the Province of Quebec. In the latter effort, Allen was captured following a poorly-organized attempt to capture Montreal in September 1775. Allen was held as a prisoner of war by the British until May 1778, when he was exchanged for a British officer. During much of the time, he lived in New York City on parole and was, by his own account, approached in late 1776 by a British officer with an offer to join the British side.Hall, pp. 164–167. The Wentworth grantholders, led by Ira Allen and Thomas Chittenden, declared independence from New York, establishing the Vermont Republic in July 1777.Wardner, p. 443. While there was significant anti-New York sentiment in the territory, there was also significant popular support for the Continental Congress, and the republic's founders regularly petitioned the Congress for admission as the fourteenth state. However, New York and New Hampshire's representatives expressed reservations over its admission until the competing land claims and jurisdictional issues could be resolved and effectively blocked any actions by Congress. First contact In 1779, Lord George Germain, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, instructed General Sir Henry Clinton, the military commander-in-chief in North America, and Haldimand, then serving as governor of Quebec, to open negotiations with the Vermonters over the possibility of establishing Vermont as a separate British province.Kingsford, p. 76. By 1780 these instructions included detailed offers to convey, including military commissions to Ethan Allen and Thomas Chittenden.Kingsford, p. 77. The first documented communication was a letter sent to Ethan Allen in March 1780 by Beverley Robinson, a noted New York Loyalist. Robinson claimed to have heard that many Vermonters still harbored Loyalist sympathies and suggested that the British would support Loyalist regiments raised in the territory. Because of difficulties in infiltrating an agent into Vermont, Allen did not receive the letter until July.Hall, p. 168. On consultation with the Vermont council, Allen made no response to the letter. Congress took up the subject of the territorial dispute in June but decided to defer discussion until September due to other pressing concerns. While Congress subsequently discussed the issue at length that September, it again postponed taking any sort of action.Hemenway, p. 941. Chittenden wrote to Congress' president in July, specifically denying that Congress had the right to adjudicate their claims and reserving the right of the Vermont administration to negotiate with the British.Kingsford, pp. 77–78. In August, Chittenden wrote a letter to Haldimand, offering a truce and parley terms to discuss the exchange of prisoners. Haldimand accepted the offer, and appointed Justus Sherwood, a Loyalist from Vermont who eventually became his spy chief, as his principal negotiator.Fryer, pp. 277–278. Sherwood in Vermont On September 26, Major Christopher Carleton left Quebec on a raiding expedition into the upper Hudson River valley, causing some alarm in Vermont.Van de Water, p. 259 Fears in the republic were heightened further by a British raid into its territory in October. Sherwood and a small company of men also left Quebec; these headed up Lake Champlain for Skenesboro (present-day Whitehall, New York). They were eventually met by Vermont militia, and Sherwood was taken to Castleton. There, he met openly with Vermont officials to formally discuss prisoner exchanges and arrange a truce, but he also had a private meeting with Ethan Allen.Kingsford, p. 78 Sherwood made offers of allegiance to the Crown in the meeting. According to Sherwood's report, Allen countered by demanding Vermont to be made a separate province with its own military command and insisted that negotiations on the subject remain secret and end if Vermont was recognized by Congress as a state.Hall, p. 171 Quebec Governor Frederick Haldimand While that was going on, word reached Haldimand of the exposure of Benedict Arnold's plot to surrender West Point, the latter's flight to British protection in New York City, and the hanging of Arnold's British co- conspirator, Major John André.Fingerhut, p. 279 As a precaution, Haldimand ordered Carleton, who was preparing to leave Fort Ticonderoga for Quebec, to remain there until Sherwood's safety could be assured.Fingerhut, p. 210 Sherwood returned safely to Quebec in late November.Fryer, p. 280 Following the meetings, Allen rode Bennington to report to Chittenden and the Vermont legislature. His report to the latter apparently raised more questions than it answered, and suspicious legislators demanded more information. Allen angrily resigned his general's commission and stormed out of the session.Van de Water, p. 260 While the legislature was able to mollify Allen, Chittenden assigned Allen's brother Ira and Joseph Fay to lead further negotiations with the British. Both met with Sherwood and George Smyth, a Loyalist doctor who had fled north from Albany. Mutually distrustful, with the British wary over the safety of their agents in light of André's hanging, they agreed only for the Vermont representatives to meet with Haldimand that winter.Van de Water, p. 262 No such meeting took place. Chittenden wrote to the governors of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, suggesting a united defense against British threats if they relinquished claims to Vermont territory. Massachusetts, with only weak claims to that territory, agreed to give up any claims when Vermont was granted statehood. New York Governor George Clinton turned a more demanding letter from Chittenden over to his legislature in February 1781 and noted that it was \\"insolent in its nature and derogatory to the honor of this state.\\"Van de Water, p. 263 The New York Senate, however, expressed concern over the fact that Vermont might ally itself with the British in Quebec and voted, to the shock of Clinton, to send commissioners to Vermont to negotiate the release of its claims. Clinton, threatening to dissolve the legislature, insisted successfully for the idea to be dropped.Van de Water, p. 265 New Hampshire's response to Vermont's proposals was complicated by the desire of communities on either side of the Connecticut River to belong to the same state, either Vermont or New Hampshire. A convention of the communities meeting in Charlestown, New Hampshire in January 1781 voted on one day to join New Hampshire and the next, following diplomatic concessions by Ira Allen, to join with Vermont.Van de Water, pp. 263–264 Evasions and acquisitions In February 1781, Beverley Robinson, having received no response from Ethan Allen to his first letter, sent a second letter in which he enclosed a copy of the first.Kingsford, p. 84 Shortly thereafter, Allen's friend Seth Warner, who still held a colonel's commission in the Continental Army, spoke with him about the ongoing negotiation and his concern that about their potentially treasonous character.Van de Water, p. 266 In response to ongoing suspicions, Allen sent the letters to Congress, noting that he had never responded to them. Congress, preoccupied with the war, did not deal substantively with the dispute in early 1781.Kingsford, p. 86 Also in February 1781, Lord George Germain wrote a letter addressed to Haldimand in which he seemed to assume the alliance was a done (or nearly-done) deal and suggested that Haldimand propose joint British–Vermont actions. The letter was carried aboard a British packet ship that was captured by the French. The letter was delivered to Benjamin Franklin in Paris; he forwarded it to Congress, where it arrived in July. Haldimand, on the other hand, was somewhat pessimistic about the whole affair, writing to Germain, \\"Ethan Allen is endeavoring to deceive both the Congress and us.\\"Van de Water, p. 267 When the letter was read in Congress on July 31, it caused an uproar and cries of treason. The often-delayed plan for British and Vermont representatives finally took place in May 1781 The details of this meeting, which ran from May 7 to 25 and took place at the British fort on Ile- aux-Noix, are primarily recounted from the writings of Justus Sherwood.Kingsford, pp. 87–91 He found Ira Allen, the principal negotiator for Vermont, to be evasive and extremely wary. Allen refused to sign any sort of preliminary agreement, claiming that although Vermont's leaders were disposed toward the idea, the populace was not, and it would have to be convinced first.Van de Water, p. 269 On May 11, Sherwood wrote, \\"My opinion corroborates with the Major's that Mr. Allen's errand here is to prolong the time and if possible to alarm Congress into a compliance with their demands.\\" He also felt that Vermont's large landowners, which included the Allens and Chittenden, might be looking more to their own interests than to those of the people of Vermont.Kingsford, p. 87 The meeting ended with an oral agreement in which the British promised to not conduct further hostilities against Vermont, and the Vermont authorities would prepare the people for reunion and try to convince the assembly to appoint commissioners to negotiate an alliance when it met in June.Van de Water, p. 270 The promises Allen made were never fulfilled since the Vermont assembly appointed no commissioners. To annoy its neighbors, it voted in the June meeting to extend its borders to the east and west, by adopting New Hampshire towns along the Connecticut River, and some New York towns east of the Hudson.Hemenway, p. 942 The territories became bargaining chips for Vermont's negotiations with Congress. To delay matters with the British, Ira Allen wrote to Haldimand in July, indicating that Vermont was sending representatives to negotiate with Congress, and that public opinion in Vermont would be more favorable once Congress rejected their terms or deferred discussions again. Chittenden also wrote to Haldimand in July, indicating that George Washington was unwilling to release back to him British prisoners that had been captured in Vermont.Kingsford, p. 94 Justus Sherwood met with Joseph Fay for two weeks in July, with a fruitless outcome that did nothing to relieve British concerns that Vermont's delays were intentional.Van de Water, p. 278 Local suspicions and further evasion When the Vermont assembly met in August, rumors were swirling about the negotiations, and the assembly insisted on seeing papers relating to them. In response, Ira Allen produced letters that had been exchanged concerning the prisoner exchanges that were the cover for the meetings.Kingsford, pp. 96–97 Around the same time, Allen extracted from the council the following statement: \\"[Allen] had used his best policy by feigning or endeavoring to make them [the British] believe that the State of Vermont had a desire to negotiate a treaty of peace with Great Britain – thereby to prevent the immediate invasion [of Vermont].... We... think it a necessary political maneuver to save the frontiers of this state.\\"Van de Water, p. 275 Congress also took up the subject of Vermont statehood in August 1781. On August 21, it approved a proposal in which statehood for Vermont would be considered if Vermont relinquished all of its claims east of the Connecticut River and west of the western border of Massachusetts.Kingsford, pp. 98–101 In September, Justus Sherwood met again with Joseph Fay and Ira Allen at Skenesboro (present-day Whitehall, New York). Allen suggested that since the Vermont assembly had changed, it would take some time to adjust. He suggested to Sherwood for Haldimand to prepare a proclamation announcing Vermont's new status.Kingsford, p. 99 The proclamation would be presented to the Vermont assembly after it had discussed and rejected the latest offer from Congress.Kingsford, p. 100 Sherwood suggested that a lack of definite action on the part of the assembly might lead to British military action.Van de Water, p. 281 The threat was followed up with the movement of British troops under the command of Barry St. Leger to occupy Fort Ticonderoga in October that was timed to coincide with the next meeting of the assembly but sent with the expectation that they would be welcomed into Vermont.Van de Water, pp. 281–283 Sherwood reported after the meeting his opinion that as much as a third of the Vermont population was unhappy with the rule of Chittenden and the Allens and was in favor of a change of government.Kingsford, p. 99 Crisis When St. Leger arrived at Ticonderoga, Vermont militia under Roger Enos were arrayed across the lake to observe them.Van de Water, p. 283 St. Leger was instructed to treat any Vermonters encountered by his men in a friendly manner. During a scouting expedition, a company of St. Leger's men killed one Vermont militiaman, Sgt. Archelaus Tupper, and captured five more.Van de Water, pp. 283–284 Horrified at what happened, St. Leger wrote a letter of apology that unintentionally divulged aspects of the conspiracy. Enos forwarded the letter to the assembly, using as a messenger someone who had long harbored suspicions about the actions of the Allen clan. In addition to delivering the letter, he broadcast his suspicions far and wide.Van de Water, p. 284 A crowd gathered at the assembly, demanding answers from Ira Allen. He demurred, claiming that Chittenden, who was not present at the time, was in possession of the relevant papers and would deliver them.Van de Water, p. 285 A series of more innocuously-worded dispatches was then forged by Nathaniel Chipman and delivered to the assembly to satisfy its demands for information.Van de Water, p. 286 The assembly considered the offer put forward by Congress and rejected it on October 16, but it agreed to consider negotiations over its boundaries.Kingsford, p. 101 Pro-British factions in Vermont had not done well in the election, and news of a French naval victory on the Chesapeake had dampened Loyalist sentiment. By mid-November news of Charles Cornwallis's surrender of his army at Yorktown arrived,Kingsford, p. 102 and St. Leger returned to Quebec.Van de Water, p. 287 Haldimand, who believed that the negotiations were conducted in good faith, and some Vermonters continued to correspond through the winter, but with the British in a weak position, and Vermont in a position that appeared strong, nothing of substance came of the exchange.Van de Water, p. 296 Agreements and complications In 1782, the fractious nature of Vermont's internal politics became a problem for the republic's quest for statehood. The southeast corner of the republic (now Brattleboro and the surrounding area) harbored strong political support for rejoining New York. In January, the \\"east side Yorkers\\" made another in a series of petitions to Governor Clinton and the Congress, complaining in part about the ongoing \\"intrigue with Canada.\\"Van de Water, p. 292 This led Clinton to call a special meeting of the New York assembly to discuss the \\"dangerous intercourse\\" going on between Vermont and the British, in which they decided to forward papers on the matter to Congress, and move to enforce the state's authority over the territory.Kingsford, p. 103 Chittenden also received a letter from George Washington in January, who wrote that he supported statehood for Vermont if it adhered to its original boundaries. He also indicated his opinion that its statehood was a virtual certainty, with only details to be negotiated. When Vermont's assembly had the letter read in February, it agreed to accept the boundaries proposed by Congress in August 1781.Fingerhut, p. 212 In response, Congress voted on March 1 to consider Vermont's statehood if, within 30 days, Vermont returned full control over the towns it previously claimed to New York and New Hampshire authority.Van de Water, p. 293 Vermont did so and notified Congress on March 31 that it had done so. Congress then began consideration of a statehood resolution but tabled it without further action on April 17.Van de Water, p. 294 It may have been influenced by the publication that month of correspondence between Haldimand and Sir Henry Clinton on the matter by a New York newspaper.Van de Water, p. 295 Publication of the letters led Governor Clinton to comment negatively on the \\"traitorous correspondence between the leaders of the New Hampshire Grants and the enemy.\\" In spite of the negative publicity, New York's assembly in April passed a bill pardoning the New Hampshire grantees of offenses they may have committed and recognizing, without requiring additional payment, the New Hampshire grants and those issued later by the Vermont Republic. That appeared to clear the significant legal roadblocks to Vermont's statehood, but the east side Yorkers continued to be a persistent problem, and Governor Clinton almost encouraged them to engage in acts of resistance against the Vermont administrationVan de Water, p. 299 and even issued commissions for New York judicial positions covering the affected area.Van de Water, p. 301 The situation got bad enough that Ethan Allen, in some secrecy, raised 250 men and marched on the town of Guilford, the epicenter of Yorker activity. That resulted in the arrest, trial, and banishment of the Yorker ringleaders in October 1782 and the seizure of some of their property.Van de Water, pp. 303–307 That prompted Congress to demand for Vermont to compensate the affected individuals.Kingsford, p. 106 Meanwhile, correspondence continued with Haldimand in Quebec, particularly by Ethan Allen. In June, Allen wrote, \\"I shall do everything in my power to render this state a British province\\", and made additional scathing commentary on the Congress.Fingerhut, pp. 212–213Van de Water, p. 297 However, the ongoing peace negotiations to end the war put a damper on the communications, which finally ended in late 1783. Statehood The state flag of Vermont With the end of the war, the subject of Vermont's statehood remained stalemated in spite of the basic agreement on boundaries. The urge for statehood subsided for a time in Vermont, as it was not burdened by the debts of the war. (In fact, the Vermont government profited from the sale of the lands seized from Loyalists.) The subject was finally raised again in 1789 when the new US Constitution came into force. Vermont's leadership was favorably disposed to it, and in the summer of 1790 negotiated terms with New York over their shared border and agreed to pay $30,000 in compensation for land grants issued by New York.Van de Water, p. 336 A Vermont convention voted by an overwhelming landslide in favor of a petition for statehood on January 6, 1791. US President George Washington presented the petition to the United States Congress on February 9, and signed the passed legislation on February 18, making Vermont the first new state to join the Union formed by the original thirteen, as of March 4. Vermont celebrated its statehood in Rutland on March 8, 1791.Van de Water, p. 337 NotesReferences * Bemis, S.

Any pharmacy task may be involved, including counting small objects (e.g., tablets, capsules); measuring and mixing powders and liquids for compounding; tracking and updating customer information in databases (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII), medical history, drug interaction risk detection); and inventory management. This article focuses on the changes that have taken place in the local, or community pharmacy since the 1960s. History Common disk-shaped tabletsManually counting individual pills on a tray Dispensing medications in a community pharmacy before the 1970s was a time-consuming operation. The pharmacist dispensed prescriptions in tablet or capsule form with a simple tray and spatula. Many new medications were developed by pharmaceutical manufacturers at an ever-increasing pace, and medications prices were rising steeply. A typical community pharmacist was working longer hours and often forced to hire staff to handle increased workloads which resulted in less time to focus on safety issues. These additional factors led to use of a machine to count medications. The original electronic portable digital tablet counting technology was invented in Manchester, England between 1967 and 1970 by the brothers John and Frank Kirby. > I had the original idea of how the machine would work and it was my patent, > but it was a joint effort getting it to work in a saleable form.

[Extract from personal > communication received in March 2010 from John Kirby.] Frank and John Kirby and their associate Rodney Lester were pioneers in pharmacy automation and small-object counting technology. In 1967, the Kirbys invented a portable digital tablet counter to count tablets and capsules. With Lester they formed a limited company. In 1970, their invention was patented and put into production in Oldham, England. The tablet counter aided the pharmacy industry with time-consuming manual counting of drug prescriptions. A counting machine consistently counted medications accurately and quickly. This aspect of pharmacy automation was quickly adopted, and innovations emerged every decade to aid the pharmacy industry to deliver medications quickly, safely, and economically. Modern pharmacies have many new options to improve their workflow by using the new technology, and can choose intelligently from the many options available. Chronology First early 1971 model counter On 1 January 1971 commercial production of the first portable digital tablet counters in the World began. John Kirby had filed U.K. Patent number GB1358378(A) on 8 September 1970 and U.S. patent number 3789194 on 9 August 1971. These early electronic counters were designed to help pharmacies replace the common (but often inaccurate) practice of counting medications by hand. Second generation late 1970s model In 1975, the digital technology was exported to America. In early 1980 a dedicated research, development and production facility was built in Oldham, England at a cost of £500,000. Between 1982 and 1983, two separate development facilities had been created. In America, overseen by Rodney Lester; and in England, overseen by the Kirby brothers. In 1987, Frank Kirby died. In 1989, John Kirby moved his UK facility to Devon, England. A simple to operate machine had been developed to accurately and quickly count prescription medications. Technology improvements soon resulted in a more compact model. The price of such equipment in 1980 was around £1,300. This substantial investment in new technology was a major financial consideration, but the pharmacy community considered the use of a counting machine as a superior method compared to hand-counting medications. These early devices became known as tablet counter, capsule counter, pill counter, or drug counter. The new counting technology replaced manual methods in many industries such as, vitamin and diet supplement manufacturing. Technicians needed a small, affordable device to count and bottle medications. In England and America, the 1980s and 1990s saw new the development of high- speed machines for counting and bottle filling, Like their pharmacy-based counterparts, these industrial units were designed to be fast and simple to operate, yet remain small and cost effective. Counter and prepackaging device In America, in the late 1990s/early 2000s a new type of tablet counter appeared. It was simple to use, compact, inexpensive, and had good counting accuracy. At the turn of the millennium technical advances allowed the design of counters with a software verification system. With an onboard computer, displaying photo images of medications to assist the pharmacist or pharmacy technician to verify that the correct medication was being dispensed. In addition, a database for storing all prescriptions that were counted on the device. Between September 2005 and May 2007, an American company undertook major financial investment, and relocated. This move added extra space for product research and development facility (R&D;). It allowed the opportunity to develop new advanced technology products that met the pharmacy’s needs for simple, accurate, and cost-effective ways to dispense prescriptions safely. Pictured here is an early American type of integrated counter and packaging device. This machine was a third generation step in the evolution of pharmacy automated devices. Later models held pre-counted containers of commonly- prescribed medications.  Global variations Tablets in a blister pack In the EU member states legislation was introduced in 1998 which had a major effect on UK Pharmacy operations. It effectively prohibited the use of tablet counters for counting and dispensing bulk packaged tablets. Both usage and sales of the machines in the UK declined rapidly as a result of the introduction of blister packaging for medicines. Current state of the industry A tablet counter has become a standard in more than 30,000 sites in 35 countries (as of 2010) (including many non-pharmacy sites, such as manufacturing facilities that use a counting machine as a check for small items). During the 1990s through 2012, numerous new pharmacy automation products came to market. During this timeframe, counting technologies, robotics, workflow management software, and interactive voice recognition (IVR) systems for retail (both chain and independent), outpatient, government, and closed-door pharmacies (mail order and central fill) were all introduced. Additionally, the concept of scalability - of migrating from an entry-level product to the next level of automation (e.g., counting technology to robotics) - was introduced and subsequently launched a new product line in 1997. Pharmacists everywhere are making the switch to automation for its increased speed, greater accuracy, and better security. As the industry evolves and customer expectations grow, automation is becoming less of a luxury and more of a necessity. Especially for independent pharmacies, automation is now a means of keeping up with the competition of large chain pharmacies. Technological changes and design improvements Constant developments in technology make the dispensing of prescription medications safer, more accurate and more efficient. Computer interfaced model counter In America, in 2008, \\"next-generation\\" counting and verification systems were introduced. Based on the counting technology employed in preceding models, later machines included the ability to help the pharmacy operate more effectively. Equipped with a new computer interface to a pharmacy management system, with workflow and inventory software. It also included \\"checks and balances\\" to ensure the technician and pharmacist were dispensing the correct medication for each patient. This was a step forward to verify all 100% of prescriptions that were dispensed by pharmacy staff. Hands-free automated model counter In America, in 2009, further advanced counters were designed that included the ability to dispense hands-free – a feature that many operators had desired. This allowed pharmacies to automate their most commonly dispensed medications via calibrated cassettes. Thirty of a pharmacy’s common medications would now be dispensed automatically. Another new model doubled that throughput via an enclosed robotic mechanism. Robotics had been employed in pharmacies since the mid-1990s, but later machines dispense and label filled patient vials in a comparatively tiny space (about nine square feet of floor space). These newer technologies allowed pharmacy staff to confidently dispense hundreds of prescriptions per day and still be able to manage the many functions of a busy community pharmacy. Other pharmacy-dispensing concerns besides counting Explaining medication usage to the patient The primary purpose of a tablet counter (also known as a pill counter or drug counter) is to accurately count prescription medications in tablet or capsule form to aid the requirement for patient medication safety, to increase efficiency and reduce costs for the typical pharmacy. Newer versions of this counting device include advanced software to continue to improve safety for the patient who is receiving the prescription, ensuring that the pharmacy staff dispense the right medication at correct dosage strength for the right patient. (see also medication safety). Today’s pharmacy industry recognizes the need for heightened vigilance against medication errors across the entire spectrum. A wealth of research has been conducted regarding the prevalence of medication errors and the ability of technology to decrease or eliminate such errors. (See the March 2003 landmark study by Auburn University’s Center for Pharmacy Operations and Designs). Prescription dispensing safety and accuracy in the pharmacy are an essential part of ensuring the right patient gets the right medication at the right dosage. A trend in pharmacy is to place a greater reliance on technology and pharmacy automation to minimize the chance of human error and speed up the process of dispensing. Pharmacy management generally sees technology as a solution to industry challenges like staffing shortages, prescription volume increases, long and hectic work hours and complicated insurance reimbursement procedures. Instead of adding more staff, pharmacies employ advanced technologies that help to handle an ever-escalating number of prescriptions, while making dispensing safer and more precise. Cross-contamination Perhaps the most controversial debate surrounding the use of pharmacy automated tablet counters is the impact of cross- contamination. Automated tablet-counting machines (sometimes better known as \\"pill counters\\") are designed to sort, count, and dispense drugs at high speeds for quick counting transactions. When more than one drug is exposed to the same surface, leaving seemingly unnoticeable traces of residues, the issue of cross-contamination arises. While one tablet is unlikely to leave enough residues to cause harm to a future patient, the risk of contamination increases sevenfold as the machine processes thousands of varying pills throughout the course of a day. A typical pharmacy may on average process under 100 scripts per day, while other larger dispensaries can accommodate a few hundred scripts in that amount of time. Thoroughly cleaning pharmacy automated tablet counters is recommended to prevent the chance of cross- contamination. This method is widely preached by manufacturers of these machines, but is not always easily followed. Performing an efficient cleaning of an automated tablet counter significantly increases the amount of time spent on counts by users. Many critics argue that these problems can easily be prevented by taking the proper precautions and following all cleaning procedures, but the increase in time spent makes it hard to justify such an investment. USP<800> Compliance concerning pharmacy automation is an evolving topic.https://www.usp.org/compounding/general-chapter-hazardous-drugs- handling-healthcare The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) considers a drug to be hazardous if it exhibits one or more of the following characteristics in humans or animals: carcinogenicity, teratogenicity or developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, organ toxicity at low doses, genotoxicity, or structure and toxicity profiles of new drugs that mimic existing hazardous drugs. Specialty pharmacies that stock and dispense medications on the NIOSH list of Hazardous Drugs must follow strict standards. Community pharmacies typically handle a small number of Hazardous Drugs; therefore, using pharmacy automation for Hazardous Drugs generally follows this guideline: pharmacy staff use an exception tray and spatula to count any Hazardous Drug, and decontaminate the tray and spatula immediately following. Pharmacy robots should not store any Hazardous Drugs for chance of pill-grinding and dust-generation. All other medications dispensed in the pharmacy that are not Hazardous Drugs can be counted with pharmacy automation safely if the manufacturer's cleaning directions are followed.  Future development  Remote tablet counter / dispenserRemote dispensing Unit Various companies are currently developing a range of remote tablet counters, verification systems and pharmacy automation components to improve the accuracy, safety, speed and efficiency of medication dispensing. Products that are used in retail, mail order, hospital outpatient and specialty pharmacies as well as industrial settings such as manufacturing and component factories. These advanced systems will continue to provide accurate counting without the need for adjustment or calibration when counting in different production environments. Pictured here is a modern (2010) remote controlled tablet hopper mechanism for use with bulk packaged individual tablets or capsules. In the UK these items are more suited to Hospital Pharmacies, where the issue of E.U. blister packaging regulations relating to medicine packaging does not apply. Also pictured is another version of an automated machine that does not allow unauthorised interference to the internal store of drugs. (A useful security feature in a large pharmacy with public access.) Repackaging process and stability data  The transient or definitive displacement of the solid oral form from the original atmosphere to enter a repackaging process, sometimes automated, is likely to play a primary role in the pharmaceutical controversy in some countries. However, the solid oral dose is to be repackaged in materials with defined quality. Considering these data, a review of the literature for determination of conditions for repackaged drug stability according to different international guidelines is presented by F Lagrange.

Plot On the evening of September 30, 1955, in Conway, Arkansas, college student Jimmy J. watches the film East of Eden, alone in a theater. The next day at football practice, he hears that the film's star, James Dean, has been killed in a road accident in California, around the same time that Jimmy J. was viewing East of Eden. He runs to the local radio station, desperate to learn the details. Jimmy J. calls his friend Billie Jean, a working-class girl who also admires Dean. Jimmy J. takes Billie Jean, his girlfriend Charlotte, his roommate Hanley, and another college couple, Frank and his girlfriend Pat, off-campus. They buy some food and Jimmy J. steals some liquor. They party near the Arkansas River, where Jimmy J. grows upset that his friends do not understand the depth of his grief. When Frank belittles Jimmy J. for caring so much about someone he has never met, Jimmy J. explains that he has seen East of Eden four times, while Billie Jean admits to seeing it 22 times; they have been anticipating the release of Dean's Rebel Without a Cause, later that month. Jimmy J. sculpts an Academy Award statuette out of mud, strips to his underwear and conducts a ceremony to summon Dean's spirit. A dog barks in the distance and he perceives the bark as a sign. The police arrive, but the group escapes back to town, where Frank and Pat tell Jimmy J. that he is disturbed. Charlotte agrees to let Jimmy J. continue the séance at her house later. Returning to his dormitory, Jimmy J. is surprised that his mother, little brother and aunt have come to take him to a movie. His mother is disappointed by his dirty appearance and worries that he will end up a loser like his estranged father. Jimmy J. calls Billie Jean and invites her to Charlotte's house that evening for the séance. Coach Haynes arrives at the dorm to confront Jimmy J., disciplining him for leaving football practice that morning. Fellow student Eugene joins Jimmy J. and Hanley as they leave the campus once again, and they stop to pick up Billie Jean, finding her dressed like the character Vampira, wearing heavy makeup and a black cape. She attempts to seduce Jimmy J., but he rebuffs her. At Charlotte's house, Billie Jean darkens the room, lights candles, and clears the furniture. When Charlotte and Jimmy J. are alone, she confronts him about Billie Jean, but he states that, while he is untrustworthy, like his father, he has not had sex with Billie Jean. When the group uses a Ouija board to contact Dean, only Jimmy J. and Billie Jean feel his presence. That night, the group wreaks havoc at the local cemetery, but when the police arrive, Billie Jean drops a candelabrum and her cape catches on fire, leaving her badly burned. Jumping forward three weeks later at the homecoming parade, Jimmy J. arrives on a motorcycle, sees Charlotte riding a float, and climbs aboard to speak with her. He confronts her for breaking up with him, kisses her, and climbs down. Hanley spots Jimmy J. and greets him warmly as Frank and Pat ride past in the parade, with Frank yelling that he thought Jimmy J. was kicked out of school. Eugene is also at the parade as part of the marching band and waves to Jimmy J. Jimmy J. visits Billie Jean, who is home from the hospital and has not spoken since the accident. She is nearly covered in bandages. He confesses that he went to see Rebel Without a Cause the previous night, watching it four times so that he could tell her all the details. He recounts how the movie parallels his own life and explains that he is responsible for Billie Jean's injuries the same way Dean's character is responsible for Plato's death. He asks her forgiveness, as he is leaving for California to visit the spot where Dean died. Speaking for the first time, Billie Jean yells at him to \\"stop it\\", and tells him that she is being sent to a sanitorium for electro-shock treatment. Her mother, Melba Lou, is mad that Jimmy J. has upset her daughter. Mother and daughter both tell Jimmy J. that life is not a movie and he leaves. Watching the homecoming football game from a distance, Jimmy J. watches Charlotte's coronation as football queen. He then rides off on his motorcycle, headed to California. Cast * Richard Thomas as Jimmy J. * Susan Tyrrell as Melba Lou * Deborah Benson as Charlotte * Lisa Blount as Billie Jean * Tom Hulce as Hanley (credited as Thomas Hulce) * Dennis Quaid as Frank * Mary Kai Clark as Pat * Dennis Christopher as Eugene * Collin Wilcox as Jimmy J.'s mother * Ben Fuhrman as Coach Haynes Production Filming of this movie was delayed for a year after Richard Thomas broke his ankle. Thomas had never ridden a motorcycle before and was practicing when he had an accident resulting in the ankle injury. The original cast included some Arkansas actors, including the part of Eugene. Unfortunately, the delay in filming coincided with the young Arkansas actors' growth spurt and the part of Eugene had to be re-cast.

Demographics History  Nutrioso's name is derived from the Spanish word Nutria (\\"Otter\\"). The early Spanish colonists referred to beaver as \\"nutria\\", perhaps because the Eurasian beaver had been extinct in Spain since the 17th century. On August 2, 1776 Francisco Silvestre Vélez de Escalante wrote in his diary, \\"...we halted in a small plain on the bank of another arroyo which is called Rio de las Nutrias, because, although it is of permanent and running water, apparently during all or most of the year it stands in pools where they say beavers breed.\\" The first settlers in the area either killed an otter and a bear (Oso in Spanish) and took the name from that incident, killed a beaver and a bear and misused the term \\"Nutria\\" or killed just a beaver and used the term \\"Nutrioso\\" to mean \\"Of Beavers\\". Nutrioso rose in importance as Mormon refugees relocated here after other nearby settlements were attacked by Native American groups. By 1880, a fort had been constructed, and by 1883 a post office was established.

At the age of 45, he ran a Chinese restaurant he bought in New York City called Jung Sy Mandarin Restaurant. He opened a second restaurant, Imig Sy, and both were strategically placed near Broadway. By the 1930s he returned to theater work, playing some minor roles until 1932, when he was cast as Wang Yun in the film, The Skull Murder Mystery. He continued with minor roles, being cast as the servant of the detective, Mr. Wong, in the 1939 film The Mystery of Mr. Wong. His last work was in The Manchurian Candidate, an uncredited role at the age of 87.  Early life  Born in 1875 in Watsonville, California, Lee was a son of Chinese immigrants. Lee's parents had started a laundry and grocery business in Watsonville, but they moved many times before finally settling in Ripon, California. In his youth, Lee had run away from home after growing pressure from his father to leave school and work full-time. Working as a servant, Lee was introduced to American music by his employers who had also encouraged him to go to school. A servant in the Oakland home of Zeno Mauvais, a local music store owner, Lee was influenced by Mae S. Mauvais, who worked in the Chinese Presbyterian Mission. Lee joined the church, sang in the mission choir, and played the piano and reed organ. Through the mission, Lee was taken in by Margaret Blake Alverson, a voice teacher who he worked with many years.  Early career  Lee first came in to the vaudeville stage in 1905. Hoping to dismantle the \\"racist attitudes that had been developing on the stage and in print media over the latter half of the nineteenth century,\\" Lee fused yellowface, a caricature portrayal of Asians done by white actors, with \\"singing operatic and popular songs, doing ethnic impersonations, and exchanging comedic pattern\\". By combining what the general public were familiar with, yellowface, and using his musical and comedic talent, Lee quickly gained recognition. His singing performance left many thinking that it was remarkable a Chinese man could sing this well. Lee broke the stereotype that Chinese musical ability were limited and inferior and became the forefront of Chinese Americans performing in American popular culture.  Touring and act  At the height of his career Lee toured vaudeville theaters from United States, Canada, and Europe. In these 14 years of touring, Lee's vaudeville acts mainly consisted of singing operatic and popular songs as well as caricature acting of the Irish, Scottish, and Chinese. Lee's most famous sets were of mocking stereotypes of Chinese immigrants and Scottish caricatures, which he based on Harry Lauder's character Highlander. Lee trained for various songs to implement in his routine. His light operatic work were also challenging such as \\"The Watcher\\" (1846), \\"The Holy City\\" (1892), and \\"Thora\\" (1905). Lee also performed many popular acts such as numbers from Tin Pan Alley and \\"My Own United States\\" (1909) a song from a Civil War-themed musical, When Johnny comes Marching Home.  Acting in Hollywood  By the 1920s, Lee stopped performing in vaudeville and had worked in his restaurant in New York City. Lee was also married in 1918 and had family commitments to uphold. Lee moved back to Los Angeles and started acting in films as talkies became popular. Lee played minor roles that were often stereotypical of Asians. In at least 39 films, Lee's roles were of the immigrant workers, cooks, servants, waiters, and laundrymen.

Biography Pullum, an Alabama-born nightclub singer, was one of the more obscure blues stars. He was accompanied on his few recordings by two pianists; Rob Cooper on his earlier discs, and Andy Boy on his later efforts. Pullum's major success was with his self-written song, \\"Black Gal What Makes Your Head So Hard?\\" (1934). It sold in large quantities and was covered by Leroy Carr, Skip James, Mary Johnson, Josh White, Bumble Bee Slim, the Harlem Hamfats, Smokey Hogg, Jimmie Gordon, Speckled Red, James Crutchfield and Robert Shaw. His subsequent recordings did not fare as well. Pullum recorded four sessions, which yielded a total of 30 tracks, between April 1934 and February 1936.Joe Pullum @ Nme.com The tracks included two intended sequels to \\"Black Gal\\", but overall sales were modest. Pullum later performed on radio on the Houston station, KTLC, backed by another pianist, Preston \\"Peachy\\" Chase. Pullum relocated to Los Angeles, California in the 1940s, and he further interpreted \\"Black Gal\\" into \\"My Woman\\", accompanied by Lloyd Glenn, on Swingtime Records in 1948. He also reputedly recorded a demo with Specialty Records in 1953. Although he was a gifted songwriter, few of his contemporaries seemed able to recall him. Pullum died in 1964, aged 58, and was buried in Houston, Texas. All of his known recordings were collated on two albums released by Document Records in 1995. Legacy Music journalist Tony Russell wrote that \\"Pullum's high clear voice, drifting over the peaks and valleys of \\"Black Gal What Makes Your Head So Hard?\\", brought the shock of the new into mid-1930s blues. No one before, male or female, had sung with such feline grace. What's more, Pullum's ethereal manner hardly prepared the listener for the song's scenario of insults, smoking pistols and suicide\\".

It was the first of Toronto's named neighbourhoods, having acquired the moniker no later than 1815, at which time the original town of York was expanding. The old neighbourhood was referred to as \\"Old Town\\" by residents, and the new neighbourhood as \\"New Town\\". The site still has many buildings dating back to the nineteenth century. The neighbourhood's approximate boundaries are Queen Street on the north from Church Street east to Parliament Street, Parliament Street south to Front Street, Front Street west to Jarvis Street, one block north to King Street and Church Street north to Queen Street. History The first town plan for York was laid out by Captain Mann in 1788. However, the original plan was rejected by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe who had a new plan drawn up by Alexander Aitkin. The plan called for a compact, ten-block townsite, laid out in a gridiron pattern near the mouth of the Don River. This ten-block plan was bounded by George, Berkeley, Adelaide and Front Streets, with the areas east of Parliament Street to the Don, and west of Peter Street to the Humber set aside for government and military purposes. Government buildings were erected near Parliament and Front Streets. Shortly after the British-Native force was defeated Battle of York on 27 April 1813, American forces occupied the settlement. In the initial days of the occupation, a number of properties in Old Town were looted and burned; including the Parliament building of Upper Canada, situated south of Old Town, on the southwest corner of Front and Parliament Street. The occupation ended on May 8, when the American force departed from York. The Parliament buildings were rebuilt in the same location after the war, in 1820. The building was destroyed in a fire in 1824. The third Parliament of Upper Canada was completed west of Old Town on Front Street in 1832. In April 1849, the area was ravaged by the Great Fire of Toronto, destroying buildings on the north side of King Street East, between Nelson Street and Church Street. The Cathedral Church of St. James was among the buildings destroyed in the fire, although it was later rebuilt in 1850. Character Opened in 1833, the First Toronto Post Office (centre) is a museum and a full-service Canada Post office. It is located next to George Brown College. The area is filled with buildings predominantly two or three storeys tall. Along the main streets of Front, King Street East and Queen Street East are numerous first floor restaurants and stores with walk-up apartments on the upper floors. The area also has numerous older warehouses that have been converted to lofts or offices. The area between Front Street on the south and Adelaide Street on the north, between Berkeley Street on the east and George Street on the west, is the ten blocks that make up the original town-site of York, as laid out in 1793. While no buildings in Old Town originated from the late 1790s, the neighbourhood does hold numerous heritage buildings that dates back to the 19th century. Additionally, several newer developments have been built in the neighbourhood, such as the Globe and Mail Centre, a 17-storey office complex completed in 2016. Landmarks * Alumnae Theatre * Bank of Upper Canada Building * St. James Anglican Cathedral * Daniel Brooke Building * First Toronto Post Office (or the Fourth York Post Office) * Paul Bishop's House Education Main building for George Brown College St. James campus. Four public school boards provide primary and secondary education to residents of Old Town. Two of the public school boards operate secular schools, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB); while the other two public school boards, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) operates separate schools. TDSB and TCDSB operate English first language schools; whereas CSV, and MonAvenir operate French first language schools. However, students of these school boards attend institutions located outside Old Town, as none of the four school boards operate a school in the neighbourhood. In addition to primary and secondary schools, Old Town is also home to George Brown College, a post-secondary college. The college operates several campuses in Toronto, including St. James campus in Old Town. St. James campus is made up of eight buildings, primarily situated on Adelaide Street East, King Street East, and Richmond Street East. Transportation 504 King is one of two TTC streetcar lines that operates within the neighbourhood. Public transportation is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) streetcar and bus system. Two east-west streetcar lines operate through Old Town, the 501 Queen on Queen Street, and the 504 King on King Street. The TTC operates two north-south bus lines in the neighbourhood, 65 Parliament on Parliament Street, and 75 Sherbourne on Sherbourne Street. In addition to these bus routes, the TTC also operates an express route through the neighbourhood during rush hour. Several major roadways serve as the neighbourhood's boundaries. Queen Street serves as Old Town's northern boundary, while Parliament Street serves as its eastern boundary. Church Street serves as the neighbourhood's western boundary north of King Street, whereas Jarvis Street serves as Old Town's western boundary of south of King Street East. Front Street serves as Old Town's southern boundary east of Jarvis Street, with the southwestern portion of the neighbourhood bounded by King Street.

The bridge carried the Pacific Highway from December 1961 until November 2017, when it was replaced by the (new) Hastings River Bridge, a concrete road bridge. The Dennis Bridge is managed by the Port Macquarie- Hastings Council.  History  The Dennis Bridge was opened in December 1961 as part of a project to replace the Blackmans Point ferry across the Hastings River and to bypass Port Macquarie. As well as the Dennis Bridge, this project included a deviation of the Pacific Highway and a connecting road from the old to the new highway route, Hastings River Drive.Main Roads Journal, Vol. 27, p. 80. The bridge was named after Department of Main Roads engineer Spencer Dennis, and is one of a series of steel truss bridges of standardised design erected by the then-Department of Main Roads in the 1950s and 1960s, predominantly across the wide coastal rivers of New South Wales.  Description  Approaches to the Dennis Bridge in 2018 The Dennis Bridge has a total length of , and consists of six truss spans and one truss span, as well as ten steel plate girder approach spans. The deck carries two lanes of traffic and a footway. Three of the truss spans form a continuous truss, with the central of these three spans (of ) being designed for conversion to a lift span. However this has never occurred. On 17 November 2017, a new bridge carrying the Pacific Highway across the Hastings River officially opened to traffic. Located to the west of the Dennis Bridge, the new bridge is part of the Oxley Highway to Kundabung upgrade project.

Characteristics = Adult  Pair copulating The plains clubtail is a medium to large dragonfly with a length of 2 1/16 to 2 3/8 inches (52 to 60 mm). The base of this dragonfly is brownish black. Its face is marked with yellow. The top of its thorax behind its head is marked with a parallel pair of yellow stripes, and every side of the thorax is marked with several diagonal yellow stripes. The base of its wings may be clouded with yellow where they attach to its body. Its abdomen is black and is marked with a line of yellow dashes along the top. As with other clubtails, the segments at the tip of its abdomen are wider than the rest.  Nymph  The nymph of the plains clubtail is a large in size with a maximum length of 1 5/16 inches (33 mm). Its abdomen is thick for most of its length, then tapers to a rounded point at the end of segment ten. On each side of abdominal segments six through nine, there is a single, rear-facing spine. This species has no dorsal hooks.  Geographical range  *United States: (Arkansas • Colorado • Iowa • Idaho • Illinois • Indiana • Kansas • Kentucky • Maine • Michigan • Minnesota • Missouri • Montana • Nebraska • North Dakota • New Mexico • Ohio • South Dakota • Texas • U.S. Virgin Islands • Utah • Wisconsin • Wyoming) *Canada: (Manitoba)  Habitat  Plains clubtails prefer moderately flowing rivers and large streams with muddy bottoms, and occasionally lakes.  Flight season  The plains clubtail has many flight seasons, mid-July to mid-August is the most common. Another flight season it has is early April to mid-August. This species is most common in spring. In Wisconsin, they have been documented to have a flight season from early June to mid-July.  Diet = Adult  Plains clubtails will feed on almost any soft-bodied flying insect such as mosquitoes, flies, butterflies, moths, mayflies, and flying ants or termites.  Nymph  Nymphs of plains clubtails feed on a wide variety of aquatic insects, including mosquito larvae, other aquatic fly larvae, mayfly larvae, and freshwater shrimp. They will sometimes eat small fish and tadpoles.  Ecology  Plians clubtail nymphs can be very selective in their habitat choice and will often occur only in certain stretches of a particular river or stream. They will burrow into the sand or mud, leaving the upturned tip of their abdomen exposed. This helps them to breathe while buried by pumping water in and out of the tip of the abdomen. Unlike most species this dragonfly nymphs emerge as adults during the day. Adults generally fly from mid-July to mid-August. They also have other flight periods. These dragonflies can not tolerate cooler temperatures and are rarely seen flying on cool or cloudy days. Hunting occurs from rocks or bare sand from which they rest on. They perch with their abdomen elevated and their wings drooping so the tips just touch the ground.  Reproduction  After when both genders mate, the female flies singly, without the male attached, to lay her eggs by dipping the tip of her abdomen into rivers, lakes, or slow streams while hovering above it. Lab experiments for this species have found that females are capable of laying over 5000 eggs.  Similar species  The plains clubtail is most similar to Tamaulipan and pronghorn clubtails. The Tamaulipan clubtail is larger and darker with wider brown thoracic stripes and females lack the erect yellow spines at every end of the postocellar ridge. The pronghorn clubtail is smaller, it may not always be reliably separated from the plains clubtail. The male pronghorn clubtail has an epiproct that is barely wider than its cerci. The sulphur-tipped clubtail is smaller with yellow on the femora and more yellow on the club.  Conservation  The populations of plains clubtails are widespread, abundant, and secure.

In 1981, she received her Master of Business Administration (MBA) with honors from DePaul University in Chicago. In 1996, Brown received her J.D. degree with honors from Chicago-Kent College of Law.  Professional career  Brown worked for Arthur Andersen and Commonwealth Edison as a certified public accountant. She also helped to start a minority public accounting firm. From 1991 to 2000, Brown worked as the General Auditor for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County (2000–present) Brown in 2008 Cook County voters elected Brown as the Clerk of the Circuit Court in 2000, and reelected her several times. As the official keeper of records for all judicial matters brought into one of the largest unified court systems in the world, Brown is responsible for managing an annual operating budget of more than $100 million and has a workforce of over 1,800 employees. In 2014 the Chicago Sun-Times described the Clerk's office as \\"a 2,300-employee office, one of the last true bastions of political patronage in Illinois\\". Major projects and services developed under Brown’s leadership include: Electronic filing (e-filing), a Clerk of the Circuit Court mobile app: \\"Court Clerk Mobile Connect,\\" an Online Traffic Ticket Payment System, an Electronic Tickets (eTickets) system, Mortgage Surplus Search, SmartForms (Online Order of Protection service), Smart Kiosks (court information terminals), and IDMS (Imaging Document Management System). All of these \\"Green Court\\"/E-Court initiatives improve accuracy, save time for court users, cut costs for the court system, and conserve energy. In 2012, during Brown's third re-election campaign, the Chicago Tribune editorial board declined to endorse any candidate, citing \\"Brown's years of failed assurances to modernize the obsolete, paper-choked office she heads.\\" Brown in 2015 In August 2015, the slating committee of the Cook County Democratic Party narrowly voted to endorse Brown for re-election to a fifth term in the March 2016 primary elections. In early October 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at Brown's home and seized her County- issued cell phone. Chicago attorney Ed Genson represented Brown. On October 23, 2015 the Cook County Democratic Party withdrew its endorsement of Brown, and endorsed Michelle A. Harris. Both the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune declined to endorse Brown or her opponent in the 2016 campaign. In August 2019, Brown announced that she would not seek reelection to a sixth term in 2020. Scandals While she was not charged with a crime by either state nor federal prosecutors, Brown, along with her office and campaign, were implicated publicly in several federal and state investigations dating to 2006. Brown accepted cash gifts on her birthday and Christmas from her employees, a practice that several former employees described as being an unspoken requirement of their jobs. In 2008 Brown announced that she would no longer accept the gifts after questions arose regarding how she claimed the items on her tax returns. In May 2006, Brown chaired the host committee for a Chicago fund raiser to support the re-election of Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans, Louisiana. Information technology contractor Mark St. Pierre, who had worked contracts for both the city of New Orleans and Cook County government and contributed to both Brown and Nagin, organized the event. Although Brown was not charged, Nagin was indicted on corruption charges on January 18, 2013, and convicted in 2014. In January 2010, the Inspector General of Cook County investigated Brown's \\"Jeans Day\\" program, in which Clerk's office employees could donate cash to the Jeans Day fund and wear casual clothing to work on a Friday. The Jeans Day fund, which grew to over $300,000, was supposed to be used to fund employee morale activities and charities. The Inspector General's report documented expenditures unrelated to charitable causes, including Chicago Bulls and Six Flags Great America tickets and employee parking reimbursements. The Inspector General's report cleared Brown's office of wrongdoing, but advised Brown provide better controls. Brown discontinued Jeans Day in August 2010. In June 2011, a contributor to Brown's political campaigns gave a commercial property at the intersection of Pulaski, Ogden and Cermak Avenues on Chicago's southwest side to Brown's husband. Two months later, the deed was transferred to The Sankofa Group, L. L. C., Brown and her husband's for-profit consulting firm, and in November 2011 The Sankofa Group sold the property for $100,000. The Cook County Inspector General and by a grand jury convened by prosecutors with the Cook County State's Attorney's office opened an investigation of the land deal. In 2013, it was reported that a campaign donor had given Brown's husband a parcel of land for $1. Brown’s name was later added to paperwork and Sankofa Group (a private entity once registered to Brown’s home) ended up on the title. Brown and her husband sold the land for $100,000. Brown did not disclose the land as a gift or donation on state economic interest forms. In November 2015, a federal indictment alleged that an clerk's office employee had been rehired by the Clerk's office weeks after lending $15,000 to a company controlled by Brown's husband, then lied to a federal grand jury about the incident. The employee pleaded guilty in 2016, and the \\"going rate\\" for a job in the office may have been $10,000.https://www.illinoispolicy.org/employee-claims-jobs-sold-for-up- to-10k-in-cook-county-circuit-court-clerks-office In 2018, a federal probe detailed accounts of alleged job-buying in Brown's office. In March 2019, a federal indictment charged Donald Danagher with bribery, alleging a pay-for- contract scheme which involved making donations to Brown's campaign and scholarship funds in exchange for his debt collection business receiving a contract. On April 26, 2019, a jury convicted former Brown aide Beena Patel, who had supervised approximately 500 employees in the clerk's office, of perjury concerning her federal grand jury testimony in 2015 and 2016.https://www.newsindiatimes.com/former-top-indian-american-aide-to-cook- county-clerk-in-illinois-convicted-of-perjury/ In late 2019, Brown's office had a class-action lawsuit brought against it alleging that it had charged illegal fees to people seeking child support enforcement. For much of her tenure, Brown has been criticized for failing to provide stored records that had been requested in a timely fashion. Pursuits of other office Brown unsuccessfully ran for Treasurer of the City of Chicago in 1999, Mayor of Chicago in 2007 and President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2010. Despite the scandals mentioned before, Brown attempted to run for mayor of Chicago in 2019, but was removed from the ballot for failing to complete the required paperwork. Following her removal from the ballot, Brown endorsed Amara Enyia for mayor. However, Enyia failed to qualify for the runoff election, which was won by former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot.

Wrestling was shot in the Montreal Forum, where major bouts were staged, as well as wrestling parlors where would be wrestlers learned and practiced their craft. The filmmakers had intended to make a film exposing, in slow motion, the fakery of professional wrestling, until a chance encounter with French philosopher Roland Barthes changed their minds. Barthes was appalled by what they were planning to do, and spoke urgently about the beauty and social role of pro wrestling in the lives of ordinary people. Persuaded by Barthes, the filmmakers set out to make a film that captured the spectacle of the sport, without judging it. The film shows the wrestling arena to be a sort of modern-day shrine, with wrestling and its rituals taking the place of religion in the then-recently secularized Quebec. Wrestling was produced by Jacques Bobet for the French program branch of the National Film Board of Canada.

Damage The earthquake was strong enough to destroy Port-au-Prince, and leveled all the buildings between Lake Miragoâne and Petit-Goâve, to the west of Port-au-Prince. The Plain of the Cul-de-Sac, a rift valley under Port-au-Prince that extends eastwards into the Dominican Republic, experienced extensive soil liquefaction. The ground under Port-au-Prince liquefied, throwing down all its buildings, including those that had survived the 1751 earthquake. One village, Croix des Bouquets, sank below sea level. Strong shocks were felt in Cap-Haïtien, about away from the estimated epicenter in the Léogâne Arrondissement. Some chimneys on the distant island of Jamaica collapsed. It is estimated that 200 people died in Port-au-Prince in collapsed buildings, including 79 of the 80 people in Port- au-Prince's hospital. The death toll would have been higher, but the earthquake was preceded by a rumbling noise that gave people time to flee their houses before the main tremor, which consisted of two shocks lasting a total of four minutes. Fifty people died in Léogâne. Tsunami The earthquake generated a tsunami that came ashore along the Gulf of Gonâve, and rolled as much as inland into the Cul-de-Sac depression, though this might have been confounded with the effects of the liquefaction. Aftermath The aftermath of the earthquake saw much more death as thousands of slaves escaped in the chaos, the local economy collapsed and 15,000 slaves died in the subsequent famine. An additional 15,000 people died from what is thought to have been gastrointestinal anthrax from eating tainted meat bought from Spanish traders.

Gratz. The animation was made with clay painting, drawings, puppets and object animation.(1988) - Plot at the Internet Movie Database Synopsis Candyjam is a whimsical, animated collaboration by ten animators from four countries. Candy is the subject and each filmmaker brings their own unique style to this experimental film which includes animated candy and objects, clay painting (a technique invented by Gratz), drawings and stop motion animation. Process Joan Gratz and Joanna Priestley met at the Hiroshima International Animation Festival in Japan in 1985, where both filmmakers had films in competition. During the trip, Priestley collected Japanese candy, which struck her as stunningly beautiful and elegant. She showed the candy to Gratz and asked her about using candy to make a film together. Gratz suggested inviting other filmmakers to direct segments of the film. Eventually they asked ten directors from four countries to create segments for Candyjam: David Anderson (London, UK), Karen Aqua (Cambridge, MA, USA), Craig Bartlett (Los Angeles, CA, USA), Elizabeth Buttler (Cambridge, MA, USA), Paul Driessen (The Hague, the Netherlands), Tom Gasek (Cambridge, MA, USA), Marv Newland (Vancouver, BC, Canada) and Christine Panushka (Valencia, CA, USA). The directors were asked to create a one minute segment of animation using candy. The directors sent back 35mm and 16mm film and Paul Driessen sent a stack of drawings on pink paper. The final format of Candyjam was 16mm. Both Gratz and Priestley were fans of Marv Newland's Anijam, a collaborative film made in 1984, so they chose the title Candyjam. Animated short films where multiple directors produced separate segments eventually became known as 'jam films'. Release Candyjam premiered in 1988 and was re-released on DVD in 2006 by Microcinema International. It was screened in 11 film festivals and was shown retrospective screenings of Joanna Priestley's films including at the Museum of Modern Art (New York, USA), Masters of Animation Festival (Trivandrum, India), American Cinematheque (Los Angeles, USA), REDCAT in Los Angeles in April 2009, Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, MN, USA), Hollywood Theatre (Portland, OR, USA) on March 10, 2014 and the Sweaty Eyeballs Animation Festival in Baltimore, MD on October 18, 2019.

It is one of ten tribes in the family, and one of four tribes in the subfamily Phyllanthoideae. Poranthereae comprises about 111 species, distributed into eight genera. The largest genera and the number of species in each are Actephila (31), Meineckia (30), and Andrachne (22). The tribe consists of herbs, shrubs, and small to medium trees. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all continents, except Antarctica. The circumscription and classification of Poranthereae were substantially revised following phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from members of the family Phyllanthaceae. Within Poranthereae, groups of related genera are strongly correlated with habitat and geographical distribution. For example, Notoleptopus, Pseudophyllanthus, and Poranthera are restricted to the Old World Southern Hemisphere. Description Monoecious, sometimes dioecious herbs, shrubs, or trees to 6m tall. Thorns or other armature absent. Stipules present, sometimes leaf-like is some Meineckia. Petioles present or absent, not pulvinate. leaves simple, arrangement alternate, subopposite, or in some Poranthera, opposite. margins entire. Inflorescences axillary, or rarely, apparently terminal. Flowers solitary to fasciculate. Sepals free, greenish, persistent. Petals present or absent, often partly adnate to the nectary disk, equal to the sepals or shorter, white or greenish, usually larger in staminate than in pistillate flowers. Disk present, extrastaminal; annular or divided into alternisepalous segments or glands. Stamens opposite the sepals, free or fused for up to 9/10 of their length. Anthers latrorse, at least in bud, opening by longitudinal slits, or in Poranthera, by pores. Ovary usually divided into three locules. Two ovules in each locule. Styles free to almost completely fused. Fruit explosively dehiscent. Seeds usually two per locule; sometimes one in Actephila and Meineckia. Taxonomy The presence and size of petals is an important character in the taxonomy of Poranthereae. In most species, the petals of staminate flowers are almost as large as the sepals, and the petals of pistillate flowers are much smaller. Petal loss or reduction has occurred at least four times in the evolution of Poranthereae. It has been observed in Poranthera, Actephila, Andrachne, and Meineckia. In one species of Poranthera and in several of Actephila, the petal size is variable, and sometimes the petals are completely absent. In some species of Actephila, petal number as well as size is variable. In Andrachne subgenus Phyllanthidea, staminate petals are lost in some species, and pistillate petals are lost in others. Petals are entirely absent in Meineckia subgenus Meineckia. History The name \\"Poranthereae\\" was first used by G.R. Grüning in 1913.G.R. Grüning. 1913. \\"Euphorbiaceae - Porantheroideae and Ricinocarpoideae\\" In: H.G. Adolf Engler (editor). Das Pflanzenreich Heft 58, page 13. (see External links below). The type genus for the tribe is Poranthera, which was so named because the anthers open poricidally rather than by longitudinal slits.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names. volume III, page 2010. CRC Press: Baton Rouge, New York, London, Washington DC. . Two similar treatments of Poranthereae were presented by Grady Webster and Alan Radcliffe-Smith, in 1994 and 2001, respectively.Alan Radcliffe-Smith. 2001. Genera Euphorbiacearum. Kew Publishing, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Richmond, England. These authors considered Poranthereae to be part of Euphorbiaceae sensu lato, a taxon that is now known to be paraphyletic. Their circumscription of the tribe was different from that which is now generally accepted. Poranthaceae, as currently understood, was first recognized in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of selected genes. The existence of this clade was not entirely unanticipated and had been at least partially suggested in several studies based on morphology. The tribe was formally established in its present form in a revision of Phyllanthaceae in 2006. In 2007, a phylogeny of Poranthereae was presented by Vorontsova et alii, based on DNA sequences of matK and ITS. This paper included much on the taxonomic history of the tribe. In 2008, based on molecular phylogenetic studies, Vorontsova and Hoffmann published a revised classification of the tribe. A description of each genus and a key to the genera were included. Four of the genera recognized by Radcliffe-Smith (Zimmermannia, Zimmermanniopsis, Archileptopus, and Oreoporanthera) were sunk into other genera and three new genera were established. Notoleptopus was \\"carved\\" out of Leptopus, while Pseudophyllanthus and Phyllanthopsis were removed from Andrachne. Some of the genera in Poranthereae are still in need of revision. This is especially true of Actephila, the most variable and least understood genus in the tribe. Phylogeny The following phylogenetic tree is based on the one by Vorontsova and Hoffmann (2008). All branches have at least 75% bootstrap support. Branches with less statistical support are collapsed to form the tetratomy in the tree below.

Synopsis Pro and Con investigates life in prison through two monologues: one by a corrections officer (Lt. Janice Inman), and the other by Oregon State Penitentiary inmate, written by Jeff Green. The guard is concerned both with the inability of our current prison system to deal with the increasingly violent nature of crime and the cyclical nature of crime within families. The inmate reflects on the isolation he feels- how much he misses not only his wife and family, but also such mundane activities as riding in a car. Pro and Con features self-portraits that were drawn by inmates at the penitentiary and object animation of weapons and crafts that were confiscated from inmates.

It was restored by George Frederick Bodley, the Gothic revival architect, in the 1870s. A generation later, in the late 1890s, Charles Robert Ashbee, a leader in the English Arts and Crafts Movement, made additions such as a billiard room and a chapel,Victoria County History, vol. XX,(1984) pp.205-6, quoted in the English Heritage list entry as well as many decorative external features. In 1912, just after the estate changed hands, the Wolverhampton architect J.K.H.E. Lavender was engaged. The gardens continued to be opened to the public on certain occasions; for example, in 1936 the Wodehouse joined the National Gardens Scheme, and as recently as in 2011 hosted the AGM of the Staffordshire Gardens and Parks Trust. In 1984, the Victoria County History volume for south-west Staffordshire called the Wodehouse one of the \\"three great houses\\" of the area, along with Enville Hall and Patshull Hall.Vol. XX Staffordshire, VCH At the turn of the 21st century, Michael Raven describes the Wodehouse as \\"unspoilt\\", with the house having \\"a certain serene and mysterious charm\\" and the property overall \\"the classic configuration of an early medieval settlement\\".Guide to Staffordshire and the Black Country, The Potteries and the Peak By Michael Raven, p372. 2004 Inhabitants At least two people associated with the Wodehouse have added to the musical life of the country. 18th century: Sir Samuel Hellier The Wodehouse was acquired by Samuel Hellier by the 1720s. He was Oxford educated, and evidently, through his collections, open to new and foreign ideas. He was someone who first had a passion for eclectic knowledge and had already accumulated a substantial library and the core of an important collection of musical instruments. He died in 1751. His only son and heir, who bore the same name, was 14 and an orphan, his mother having predeceased his father. One of the boy's more sympathetic guardians was Charles Lyttelton, Dean of Exeter, who encouraged him to study at Exeter College, Oxford.Catherine Frew and Arnold Myers, \\"Sir Samuel Hellier's 'Musicall Instruments'\\", Galpin Society Journal, vol. 56, June 2003. Includes a full-page colour portrait. JSTOR link As a young man, he wrote of his longing to marry, but never did so, blaming in part his finances. His maternal grandmother, Sarah Huntbach of Seawall, a dowager heiress, controlled the Featherstone part of his estate. Despite these constraints, he managed to redesign the Wodehouse's expansive gardens, as described above. He became High Sheriff of Staffordshire like his father before him , a position now largely ceremonial but then the principal law enforcement officer of the county, and was knighted in 1762. In addition to the items for which he was famous, he collected beautiful or unusual objects: a gold cane-handle depicting the intertwining of the emblems of several local families was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum. Sir Samuel spent a great deal of money on collecting a musical treasure trove of instruments and newly published works. He was particularly interested in Handel;Best, Terence, ed. Handel collections and their history, a collection of conference papers given by the international panel of distinguished Handel scholars. Clarendon Press, 1993 indeed, the catalogue accompanying the National Portrait Gallery exhibition marking the tercentenary of the composer's birth calls Sir Samuel, and abolitionist Granville Sharp, two men of the late eighteenth century \\"who have left us solid evidence of the means by which they indulged their enthusiasm\\".p 239.

His son James, manager of Netherton colliery, died in 1827; he had also been known to steward the races at nearby Penn Common. The family continued its close ties with St. John's Wolverhampton; in addition to Sir Samuel's endowment and his successor's work there, in 1820 a daughter of the house, Parthenia, married the minister.New Monthly Magazine, 1820, p710.

Shaw-Hellier For a period in the middle of the century Thomas Shaw-Hellier, the grandson and direct heir of the Reverend Thomas Shaw, rented out the property. Being a keen huntsman, he preferred the country seats of Packwood House and latterly Rodbaston Hall. In his absence, Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale, the Liberal politician, pacifist, and philanthropist, and his wife Alexandra Tolstoy apparently lived for a time in the Wodehouse. Stanhope was elected to Parliament in 1886, sitting first for nearby Wednesbury. One of their houseguests at the Wodehouse was William Ewart Gladstone.Review by Eugenio F.

P38-39 One of his expat friends there was the artist Robert Hawthorn Kitson; another in his circle was the writer Robert Smythe Hichens.

The Ashbees saw him as childlike, \\"perpetually young\\" and sprightly even in his 70s, enthusiastic, unpompous, devoted \\"to all the little simple helpful things of life\\", and erratic in his musical taste. He died in Sicily in 1910. The estate passed to his nephew Evelyn Simpson, who changed his name to Shaw-Hellier; his ancestors had owned a brewery in Baldock since the 1770s. On his death in 1922, the estate passed to Evelyn's daughter Evelyn Mary Penelope Shaw-Hellier, his son having been killed in World War I.Mike Brown. \\"On the Trail of the Phillips\\", Brewery History, 111, pp. 37-63. 2003, based on Journal 49 October 1986.Illustrated London News 1915 The two surviving Shaw-Hellier sisters lived in the Wodehouse (and possibly also in the Villa San GiorgioMacCarthy, Fiona.The Simple Life: C.R.

There is a Shaw Hellier Avenue named after the family, in the nearby Brierley Hill. Musical legacy The musical collection is most closely associated with Sir Samuel Hellier, but the most valuable item within it preceded him, and those who came after him maintained or added to the printed works and instruments. The Hellier Stradivarius of circa 1679 is a violin made by Antonio Stradivari of Cremona, Italy. Cozio, an instrument authentication business, states that it was in the possession of Sir Edward Hellier in 1734,Cozio page on Hellier Stradivarius so it is possible that the Englishman bought it directly from the elderly luthier himself, perhaps during a grand tour. It was kept by the family for almost two hundred years. In 1880, it was sold by Colonel Shaw-Hellier, but he repurchased it ten years later. Upon his death in 1910, it passed out of the family. It is now in the care of the Stradivari Foundation in Cremona, where it is on display at the Museo del violino. The Galpin Society rediscovered the treasure trove in a room in the stableblock in the 1960s. A researcher who did some of the cataloguing the following decade states that it was rare to find a collection in which both instruments and books survive, but the collection was split up soon afterwards. The instruments went to the Edinburgh University Collection of Historic Musical Instruments. A single one that was chosen or commissioned by Sir Samuel Hellier—in this case a trumpet—has been described in half a dozen journals and catalogues. The other half of the collection, the written works, went to the music library of the Barber Institute of Fine Arts at the University of Birmingham, where its 860 items were fully documented by Ian Ledsham in 1999.Volume 57, Number 3, March 2001.

In addition, and still at the Wodehouse, is a series of 165 letters Sir Samuel wrote to his estate manager, specifying how instruments were to be played and stored, a boon for the music historian. Non- musical gifts were made to museums as well. For example, a model of a 64-gun ship with rigging, made in the late 18th century, was donated to the Pitt Rivers Museum in the late 19th.

While he himself undertook only a single collecting trip – to Spain and Portugal, he was charged with working up collections of grasses mainly from Japan, Taiwan, New Guinea, Brazil and Argentina. Apart from agrostologisty systematics, Hackel also contributed to the morphology and histology of members of the grass family. The genus Hackelochloa (Poaceae) is named for him.

Known as Spa Road, the highway runs from the beginning of state maintenance near Ferry Point Road north to MD 450 and MD 435 in Annapolis. MD 387 was constructed in the late 1920s. Much of the highway was transferred from state to municipal maintenance in the mid-1970s. Route description View south along MD 387 at Forest Drive in Annapolis MD 387 begins at the end of state maintenance just north of the junction of Ferry Point Road and Harness Creek Road. Both roads serve residential communities on the South River. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road. Just north of Old Forest Drive, which is unsigned MD 788A, MD 387 enters the city of Annapolis and becomes municipally maintained. The highway has an oblique intersection with Forest Drive just north of the city limits. MD 387 temporarily gains a second lane southbound and a center turn lane between its intersection with Hilltop Lane and its crossing of Spa Creek. The highway gains a center turn lane again north of the creek and veers northeast between historic Wiley H. Bates High School and the Ballet Theatre of Maryland. MD 387 reaches its northern terminus at the Westgate Circle roundabout at the southeast corner of Annapolis National Cemetery. MD 450 (West Street) forms the east and west legs of the roundabout; the north leg is MD 435 (Taylor Avenue). A one-lane spur from MD 387 to eastbound MD 450 serves as frontage along the south side of the roundabout. History MD 387 was constructed as a concrete road in 1929 and 1930. By 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended the highway be widened to . The portion of MD 387 within the city of Annapolis was transferred from state to municipal maintenance in 1974.

Skyline of Covington Kentucky Founding 1878 Encyclopaedia Britannica, showing the layout of downtown Covington and Newport to the south In 1814, John Gano, Richard Gano, and Thomas Carneal purchased on the west side of the Licking River at its confluence with the Ohio River, referred to as \\"the Point,\\" from Thomas Kennedy for $50,000. The men named their new riverfront enterprise the \\"Covington Company,\\" in honor of their friend, Gen. Leonard Covington, an American officer who once trained troops in the area and was killed in the War of 1812 at Crysler's Farm. The investors prepared a plat for the new city that was approximately five blocks wide by five blocks deep. The platted streets lined up with the streets of Cincinnati across the Ohio River, symbolically tying the future of the fledgling city to its larger neighbor to the north. The first five streets, running north to south, were named for Kentucky's first five governors: Shelby, Garrard, Greenup, Scott, and Madison. In February 1815, the Kentucky General Assembly incorporated the land as the town of Covington. At the time of its incorporation, Covington and all of today's Kenton County was a part of Campbell County. Shortly after its incorporation, the investors began selling lots in the new city for $385 a lot. However, for the next 15 years, lot sales were slow and disappointing. By 1830, the young city had a population of only 715 and lot prices were selling for half their value in 1815. Image:Licking Riverside Mansion1.jpg Image:Licking Riverside Mansion2.jpg Image:Licking Riverside Mansion4.jpg Housing and population growth After 1830, in large part because of the influx of German immigrants, Covington's population began to grow significantly, creating a number of distinct and diverse neighborhoods within the city. This growth was recognized by the Kentucky legislature, which, in February 1834, incorporated the town as a city. By 1840, the population in the city increased to 2,026, which included eleven free blacks and 89 slaves. Mutter Gottes/Old Town and Mainstrasse This population resided not only within the established boundaries of the city but outside, causing the city to undertake its first annexation, which extended the city to Main Street to the west and 12th Street to the south. This annexation brought the neighborhoods now known as Mutter Gottes/Old Town and Mainstrasse. Fueled in part by the European revolutions of the mid-19th century, many Europeans, particularly Germans, immigrated to Covington. At this time, the primary commercial district and gathering place was on Main Street near Sixth Street, the area now known as \\"Mainstrasse.\\" Sixth Street was laid out with a wide width that allowed the city, in 1861, to establish a public market in the center of the street with traffic lanes on either side. The nearby Mutter Gottes Kirche (Mother of God Church), built in 1871, was the center of another German- speaking neighborhood. Old Seminary Square and Westside At the same time the western area of the city was growing, development began to stretch to the south. In the late 1830s, the Western Baptist Education Society purchased , which would define the city's southern boundary in 1841. On this tract, the organization established a seminary and set aside for a cemetery, which in 1843 would become known as Linden Grove Cemetery, the final resting place for several Civil War soldiers. To raise money to build its campus, the Baptists entered into the real estate market, subdividing the land and selling lots around its campus and cemetery. Many graves were left untouched as the building of structures progressed into an area now known as Old Seminary Square, Mainstrasse Village and the Westside. In 1843, the city annexed most of the Society's subdivisions, which expanded the city's boundaries to 15th Street. Within two years of opening the Western Baptist Theological Institute on Russell Street in 1845, the trustees of the organization became embroiled over the slavery issue. This ultimately ended with the dissolution of the institute in 1853 and the division of the property between the opposing factions. At the same time, the tracks for the Covington and Lexington Railroad were laid in the area, bisecting the college campus. Fifteen years later, the original St. Elizabeth Hospital moved into one of the old college buildings, where it operated from 1868 to 1911. Austinburg and Lewisburg At the same time that the Society was developing its property, Seneca Austin and his wife purchased and started developing along the Licking River from approximately 16th Street to 20th Street, creating the neighborhood we now call Austinburg. In 1851, the city annexed all of the Austins' land to Wallace Avenue as well as the western neighborhood now known as Lewisburg. Both communities were settled by largely German contingents, who established churches and parishes as focal points in their communities: St. Benedict's Catholic Church and parish in Austinburg, and St. John's the Evangelist Catholic Church and parish in Lewisburg. Image:St. Benedict's Church2.jpgFacade of St. Benedict's Catholic Church by Br. Paul Byrd, OP Image:A Snow Storm over Austingburg, Covington, KY.jpgA snow storm in Austinburg, looking east toward the Licking River. Wallace Woods and Levassor Park Immediately south of Austinburg were three large estates owned Robert Wallace, Daniel Holmes, and Eugene Levassor, all of whom were successful merchants. In 1867, on that he had acquired next to the Wallace and Levassor estates, Holmes constructed a 32-room redbrick English-Gothic \\"castle,\\" which was called Holmesdale. After Holmes died and his wife and children had returned to their native New Orleans, the family sold the mansion and to the Covington Board of Education in 1915. The mansion served as the Covington High School until 1936, when the structure was razed and a new high school was constructed. This building and five others now occupy the former estate grounds as part of the Holmes High School campus. In the 1890s, the Wallace and Levassor estates on either side of the Holmes estate were developed, creating upscale neighborhoods at the end of the streetcar line. Many stately homes were constructed on large lots in these neighborhoods. Peaselburg Just west of Wallace Woods and the railroad tracks, a German, working-class neighborhood developed in the latter years of the 19th century. This community was known by its inhabitants as \\"Peaselburg.\\" In 1880, the community incorporated as an independent municipality and changed its name to Central Covington. In 1894, the Wallace Woods heirs agreed to be annexed by far less wealthy Central Covington because its tax rates were substantially lower than those assessed by the City of Covington. The next year, Covington attempted to annex Central Covington, but support for the effort did not materialize. However, a decade later, many Central Covington businesses and homes were flooded by the eruption of a major sewer line. Covington offered to help the smaller municipality but only if the residents agreed to annexation, which occurred in 1907. Thus, Central Covington (and indirectly Wallace Woods) became a part of Covington. Six years later, St. Augustine Catholic Church was constructed on 19th Street, serving as this neighborhood's focal point and community gathering place. Latonia and Rosedale In 1882, a group of investors formed the Latonia Agricultural and Stock Association to create a horseracing track south of Covington. Purchasing more than north of Banklick Creek in an area then known as Milldale, and using the name of the nearby resort of Latonia Springs, the investors renamed this area Latonia. The track opened in June 1883, but it wasn't until 1890 that Kenton County granted the Covington electric streetcar company the right to lay tracks from the Covington city boundary to this area of the county. In 1896, a portion of this area was incorporated as the city of Latonia, with a starting population of about 1,500. Adjacent to Latonia to the south was a community known as Rosedale, which was actually a part of Latonia. In 1909, Covington annexed Latonia and Rosedale, in part to relieve Latonia of financial difficulties it was encountering. West Covington The independent city of West Covington, formerly known as Economy and now known as Botany Hills, is located along the Ohio River on the hills west of downtown Covington. This city was platted in 1846 and St. Ann's Church was constructed in the area in 1862 and served this primarily German-Catholic community. After an unsuccessful attempt to annex this city in 1873, Covington annexed it in 1916, in part because of water problems in the area and a lack of a high school. Smaller annexations in the mid 20th century After the annexation of West Covington in 1916, the boundaries of Covington remained the same for the next 35 years while other municipalities were established in areas surrounding Covington, such as Park Hills, Fort Wright, and Lakeside Park, to name a few. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city annexed small tracts of land – in Lewisburg in 1951, in Latonia in 1956, and that was formerly occupied by a Benedictine Monastery (now the Monte Casino neighborhood) in 1963 – but these annexations were of a small scale compared to tracts annexed during the first 100 years of the city's existence. 1960s annexations (Kenton Hills and South Covington) During the 1960s, the city annexed a considerable amount of property that would establish the current boundaries of the city. Starting in 1965, the city annexed near Kyles Lane. In 1965, the city added near Devou Park, which was then known and is still known as Kenton Hills. Finally, in 1965, the city undertook its biggest annexation effort ever when it added of unincorporated land in Kenton County south of Latonia, creating the community now known as South Covington. Population growth The population of Covington grew from 743 in 1830 to 24,505 in 1870 to 42,938 in 1900. From this number, the population grew to its highest recorded count – 65,252 – in 1930. Perhaps due to problems associated with the Great Depression in the 1930s, U.S. Census Bureau recorded the city's first drop in population in its history in 1940, when the population was documented at 62,018. For the next two decades, the population would remain in the low- to middle- 60,000s. Due in large part to urban flight that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, the city's population dropped from 60,376 in 1960 to the lowest recorded census count in recent history in 2010, 40,640. In the most recent U.S. Census estimate, conducted in 2014, the city's population increased slightly to 40,944. Economic growth=First commercial development In its infancy, most of the commerce in Covington was connected with the rivers that formed the northern and eastern boundaries of the city. Because the Kentucky side of the Ohio River was relatively shallow compared to the Ohio side of the river, Covington was never able to develop its riverfront as a viable public landing for boats and steamships, which instead moored on the Cincinnati side of the river, where steamship building facilities were located. The city's first manufacturing concern, a cotton factory, was built near the river in 1828, and three years later, another business, a rolling mill and nail factory, was established along Scott Street near the riverfront. First commercial center The first commercial center of the city was established around the \\"public square\\" platted between Third and Fourth Streets and Scott Boulevard and Greenup Street. At this location, a market house was constructed in 1831 and a public well was dug approximately one block from the square. During the 1830s, along with the public market, retail stores, businesses offices, and other commercial establishments flourished in this area. In the mid-19th century, two things promoted the growth of Covington. First, in 1840, the Kentucky General Assembly severed Kenton County from Campbell County. Despite the legislative directive that county seat be at the center of the county, Covington served as the de facto county seat until the City of Independence was incorporated in 1842. Because Independence was sparsely populated and approximately from Covington, the residents and lawyers of the thriving urban area found it more convenient to transact business and administer justice at the Covington courthouse, which was constructed near the public square in 1843. Recognizing that Covington was serving as the de facto county seat, the Kentucky legislature, in 1860, enacted a law authorizing Covington as the site for the recording of deeds and mortgages – making Kenton County only one of two counties in Kentucky with dual county seats (the other being Newport and Alexandria in Campbell County). Madison and Pike Street commercial corridor Restored, Odd Fellows Hall, on Madison Ave. The other major development occurring during this time period was the construction of the Covington and Lexington Railroad in 1853. While the public square remained a hub for the \\"courthouse crowd,\\" in large part because of the railroad, the area of Madison Avenue and Pike Street became the city's primary commercial center during the rest of 19th century and into the 20th century. With a train stop at Russell and Pike Streets, which was also near the terminus of the Covington and Lexington Turnpike, the area of the city soon became a beehive of commercial activity. Packing houses, groceries, dry goods stores, meat markets, printers, jewelers, saloons, lumber yards, machine shops, hardware stores, and more than 20 hotels cropped up in this area of the city. In the years following the Civil War, Covington largely prospered as a result of the city's access to the tobacco grown around the Bluegrass, with numerous cigar factories around the town. Its iron mills, distilleries, glassworks, and stove makers were also noteworthy. Birdsill Holly's innovative water supply network was introduced in 1871. As with Cincinnati, many immigrants to the area were German and many were Catholic. A parochial orphanage was established about 4 miles outside town, and the St Elizabeth Hospital and the Benedictine priory of St Joseph and nunnery of St Walburga were among the city's principal buildings. By the time of the First World War, Covington was serviced by the Chesapeake & Ohio and Louisville & Nashville railroads. It was the state's second-largest city and its second-largest municipal economy. It received a Catholic bishopric and a Gothic cathedral. Its factories at the time had grown to include textile mills, foundries, machine shops, and cordage makers. Covington-Cincinnati Suspension Bridge A view of the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge from Covington on the south bank of the Ohio River with Cincinnati in the background. The next major project that spurred the economic growth of Covington was the decade-long construction of the Covington- Cincinnati Suspension Bridge between Covington and Cincinnati. Built by John A. Roebling, construction started in 1856. Work on the bridge continued for two years before the effects of the 1857 depression brought construction to a halt. Work on the bridge resumed in 1863 but once again was delayed because of the Civil War. The bridge formally opened on January 1, 1867, promoting further commerce between Kentucky and Ohio. In part because of depressions of 1873 and 1893, commercial construction was not significant in Covington during the latter part of the 19th century. However, that would change dramatically in the early 20th century for a number of reasons. One of these reasons was that the Suspension Bridge – originally designed for horse cars and pedestrians – was reconstructed in the late 1890s to accommodate electric streetcars – and in a few years, automobiles. During the early 20th century, many new commercial and governmental structures were constructed in Covington. Heyday The heyday for Covington as the commercial center for all of Northern Kentucky was the first two decades of the 20th century. During these decades, particularly the 1920s, the city's downtown was a bustling place of activity, with numerous restaurants, department stores, shops, saloons, banks, theaters, and offices bringing swarms of people to the downtown commercial district. Among the buildings that were constructed during this high-growth period were several near the public square, such as the city and county building, dedicated in 1902 and the Cincinnati, Newport, and Covington Railway Company headquarters, completed in 1903 (later acquired by the Citizens Telephone Company), to name a few. In addition, a number of other commercial structures were constructed in the downtown commercial district that survive today, such as the Masonic Lodge at the corner of Fourth and Scott Boulevard, the Kentucky Times-Star Building in the 500 block of Scott, and the Edward Pieck pharmacy building (later the Greyhound bus station building) at the southeast corner of Fifth Street and Madison Avenue. It was also during this time period that Covington became the financial center of Northern Kentucky, housing the following lending institutions, primarily on Madison Avenue: the First National Bank, German National Bank, Covington Savings Bank & Trust Co., Citizens National Bank, and Peoples Savings Bank and Trust Company, to name a few. This was also a period when the manufacturing industry significantly increased in Covington. Of particular note was the growth of The Stewart Iron Work Company, which employed as many as 600 people in 1915. It was a highly guarded secret that Stewart Iron Works made the special \\"non-sawable\\" bars for the cells at Alcatraz Prison. The Bavarian Brewery was a large employer in the west side with strong sales until Prohibition in 1918. Other manufacturing firms that operated during this time period include the United States Motor Truck Company and Kelley-Koett Manufacturing Corp. of Covington, Ky., one of the country's earliest manufacturers x-ray accessories and equipment. Known for many of its beautiful churches, this was also the time frame during which one of the city's icons, St. Mary's Basilica Cathedral of the Assumption, was built, which was dedicated in 1910. It was also during this time frame when the city acquired two of its most prized parks: Goebel Park in the Mainstrasse neighborhood and Devou Park, more than 500 acres (2 km2) of pristine land in the western hills of the city. Decline While the Great Depression of the 1930s devastated many Covington businesses and residents, the city's decline did not become pronounced until the 1960s. As mentioned above, the city's population remained somewhat stagnant for three decades. But post-World War II urban flight, coupled with a substantial reduction in the city's manufacturing sector, caused a significant decline in the city's workforce as well as its resident population. If the 1920s was the last great decade for Covington, then the 1970s – and to a certain extent the early 1980s – was the nadir for the city, at least with respect to its downtown. Despite construction of the IRS service center by the federal government in the 1960s, which brought many new jobs to the city, the city began a downward spiral of disinvestment, which continued for several decades. In fact, in the late 1970s, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development identified Covington as one of the country's \\"most distressed cities.\\" During this time period, as new retail centers and malls grew in the suburbs, long-established Covington retail firms either closed or left downtown Covington. Among the stores and shops that left or closed were Goldsmith's Department Store, Eilermann's Department Store, Coppin's Department Store, Montgomery Ward, S.S. Kresge Co., Herzog's, Louis Marx & Sons Furniture, Modern Furniture, Woolworth's, Penney's, Sears, the First National Bank, and the Madison and Liberty theatres, to name a few. Many of these storefronts remained empty during this time period or were replaced with less attractive commercial endeavors or social service agencies. Rebirth Covington's downtown neighborhoods have many wooded streets and historic buildings, some of which date to the nineteenth century. Beginning in the mid-to-late-1980s, Covington began its revival. New buildings were constructed, jobs were created, and the population loss began to stabilize. The rebirth of Covington as a commercial center occurred in the same place where the city commercial growth first occurred – along the Ohio River and in one of the city's first commercial districts, Main Street. The rebirth on the river began modestly in 1984 when developer David Herriman built the $4.4-million, 34-unit Riverside Terrace condominium complex on Riverside Drive. Two years later, Herriman constructed the 43-unit Riverside Plaza, a companion condominium project just south of Riverside Terrace, for $7.5 million. With the city and state investing approximately $7 million in infrastructure improvements in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including construction of the Carroll Chimes Bell Tower with its carillon and glockenspiel in Goebel Park, Main Street and Sixth Street was renamed \\"Mainstrasse,\\" and returned to its roots as a German village with restaurants, taverns, and specialty retail shops. In the mid-to-late-1980s, the city, using state and local funds, began acquiring properties along the Ohio River for redevelopment. In 1988, the city and local developer Corporex entered into a master development agreement to redevelop the city's riverfront, which kicked the city's renaissance into high gear. The first phase of this redevelopment occurred in 1990 when the $110-million, 18-story Rivercenter office tower and a 230-room Embassy Suites hotel was built atop a 1,100-space parking garage constructed by the city. In 1994, Fidelity Investments established a campus in Covington, constructing three office buildings on the campus, totaling approximately and employing 2,000 employees. At the same time the Fidelity campus was underway, Wessels Construction built the IRS Gateway Center on Scott Boulevard, between Third and Fourth Streets, which would employ approximately 2,000 IRS employees when completed. In 1997, Rivercenter II was built next to Corporex's first downtown office tower, and during the same year, across Madison Avenue from the Rivercenter complex, a new garage was funded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and built by Corporex. A year after the garage was finished, a 300-room Marriott hotel was built atop a portion of the garage. Two years later, on the remaining portion of the parking garage, eleven floors of office space was constructed, now known as Madison Place, and on top of this office space four floors of multimillion-dollar residential condominiums called Domaine de la Rive were built. In 1998, across the street from the Marriott hotel, the Commonwealth of Kentucky contributed $30.5 million to build the Northern Kentucky Convention Center. In 2001, a block away from the convention center, Wessels Construction would add a expansion of the Gateway Center on Madison Avenue and Third Street. Another block away, Towne Properties would build Roebling Row Apartments, an 86-unit luxury apartment building with architectural features compatible with nearby structures in the surrounding historic Licking Riverside neighborhood. Meanwhile, a housing boom was taking place in the southern part of the city. Among new subdivisions built in South Covington in the 1990s were Ridgeport (275 homes), Clover Meadow (88 homes), and Heathermoor (100 upscale homes). The 21st century Skyline of downtown Covington Covington has continued its struggle to rebound into the 21st century. The redevelopment along the riverfront in the 1980s and 1990s slowly moved southward into the downtown area. A few existing structures were rehabilitated and new businesses located there, but by December 2011, nearly one third of the commercial spaces still remained vacant. In 2005, in an attempt to attract the \\"creative class\\" into the commercial district, the City of Covington created the Covington Arts and Technology Zone (\\"CATZ\\") on Pike Street . After six years of struggling, it became obvious to city leaders that it did not work as a redevelopment tool and the City Commission voted to repeal the \\"Covington Arts and Technology Zone\\" in 2011. The Ascent at Roebling's Bridge In 2008, Corporex completed the 22-story luxury condominium project, The Ascent at Roebling's Bridge. Designed by world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, with help from local architect GBBN, the wedge-shaped structure won the 2008 CNBC property award for best high-rise in the Americas, and was a featured project in the AIA April 2008 newsletter. Viral video controversy On January 19, 2019, a video appearing to involve students from Covington Catholic High School and a Native American man engaged in a form of conflict was released and quickly gained attention. As a result, Covington city officials have reported receiving threats of violence toward them, as well as the city itself. A \\"suspicious package\\" was also found outside of the Diocese of Covington.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/01/23/a5768042-1f5d-11e9-8b59-0a28f2191131_story.html However, despite the school's name, Covington Catholic High School is not located in Covington, Kentucky, but in Park Hills, Kentucky, which is a neighboring city.https://www.covcath.org/about/our-campus/address-directions In response to the increasing calls for boycotts against Covington and its businesses, hostilities toward the city, and calls for violence, due to the misidentification, Covington's mayor, Joe Meyer, released a statement on the issue, saying in part \\"Over the past few days, we at the City of Covington have been cursed and threatened by email, over the phone, and in person. Our City is collateral damage in an incident that had nothing to do with us, happened 500 miles away, and coincidentally involves a school that actually isn’t even in Covington.\\" Covington's Neighborhood Movement Covington owes many of its more recent accomplishments to the action of dedicated residents and neighborhood groups. The first round of this neighborhood movement came about in the mid-to-late-1970s as part of a reformist movement to improve the city. Many neighborhood associations were formed at the time, and the Covington Neighborhood Action Coalition, or CNAC, was established. CNAC served as an umbrella organization for many active neighborhood associations, with each organization having delegates as part of annual CNAC conventions. CNAC addressed citywide concerns and endorsed neighborhood issues, such as opposition to the proposed location of a coal dock in Latonia and advocating for the improvement of sewers in Peaselburg. CNAC also received federal funding from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) to create the city's first block watch, a forerunner to today's Neighborhood Watch. The neighborhood movement reached its peak in the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, CNAC membership waned as many citywide issues had been addressed and no funding was available for staff assistance to the neighborhood groups. Several neighborhood associations, such as those in Wallace Woods and Licking Riverside, persisted despite the decline of CNAC. The Neighborhood Watch Program began in 1985 when Latonia residents began organizing neighborhood watches after a murder and several break-ins in their neighborhood. Watch members work closely with the Covington Police and Code Enforcement Departments and play an instrumental role in making our community safer. In 1996, residents initiated a call for a new CNAC-like organization. At the same time, the Center for Great Neighborhoods of Covington, then known as the Covington Community Center, was reorganizing and defining strategic growth areas for its organization. At the request of residents, the Center agreed to help organize and staff the new organization, the Covington Neighborhood Collaborative. Today, CNC has 12 member organizations and works on both citywide and neighborhood issues. Several other neighborhoods, including the Eastside, South Covington, and Mainstrasse, also have active neighborhood associations that are not currently a part of CNC.

Located in the Tenderloin district in San Francisco, California, the St. James Infirmary is a 501(c)(3) public charity. Its services are free and confidential. Named after the sex worker rights activist and founder of COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics), Margo St. James, the St. James Infirmary is the first occupational safety and health clinic for sex workers run by sex workers in the United States. History In 1993, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed legislation that called for the establishment of the San Francisco Task Force on Prostitution. This Task Force was formed to investigate, “prostitution patterns,” and to “recommend social and legal reforms which would best respond to the City’s needs while using City resources more efficiently”.SF Task Force on Prostitution Final Report, p. 3 In 1996, the Task Force issued its final report and determined that the City's responses to prostitution were not only ineffective, but also harmful. Pertaining to health, safety and services, the report stated that, “programs should include occupational and educational programs, health and other programs for those who continue working as prostitutes, as well as those who wish to transition into other occupations”.SF Task Force on Prostitution Final Report, p. 24 Under “Hold and Treat” laws, persons arrested for prostitution charges would be forcibly tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections. In 1998, Margo St. James, a local sex workers' rights activist and COYOTE member, received a call from a woman in jail who had been arrested for prostitution, who told Margo that while held awaiting charges, her blood had been drawn without the woman's consent and without her knowledge of what test was being performed. Margo called the Director of STD Control and Prevention of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, Dr. Jeffrey Klausner. Dr. Klausner invited members of the sex worker community for a meeting on the health status of sex industry workers. Before this meeting, Dr. Klausner was aware that the San Francisco Department of Public Health was not “really working with the sex worker population and/or the massage parlor workers. So [he] wanted to initially do some outreach to those populations” (J. Klausner, interview, September 4, 2003). This was the beginning of conversations and alliances to be made that provided the framework for a peer led occupational health and safety clinic for sex workers. The St. James Infirmary was made possible because of the unique vision of sex worker rights activists from COYOTE and the Exotic Dancers Alliance (EDA) and a timely event in the San Francisco County Jail. Via collaboration with the Department of Public Health STD Control and Prevention Section (known as “City Clinic\\"), University of California San Francisco (UCSF), COYOTE and EDA, in 1999, the first Occupational Health and Safety Clinic run by and for Sex Workers was created. Located in the South of Market district of San Francisco, the mission of the St. James Infirmary is to provide compassionate and non-judgmental health care and social services for all sex workers while preventing occupational illnesses and injuries through a comprehensive continuum of services. Annually, St. James provides 8,000 clinic and venue based services to thousands of sex workers in the Bay Area. The St. James Infirmary services include Primary Care, Gynecological and Urological Care, Transgender Hormone Therapy, HIV/STI, TB & Hepatitis Counseling and Testing, STI treatments, Hepatitis A & B Immunizations, Acupuncture, Massage & Reiki Therapy, Peer and Mental Health Counseling, Support Groups, Food and Clothing, Syringe Access & Disposal, Condoms & Lube, Information & Service linkages, Apprenticeship & Internship Programs, and Research & Education. There are many factors which affect the working conditions and experiences for all sex workers including the political and economic climate, poverty and homelessness, stigmatization, violence, as well as the overwhelming intricacies of the legal, public and social systems. The fear of stigma and indeed, the very real stigma associated with this work itself, forces many sex workers into isolation. This isolation puts sex workers at greater risk of occupational health and safety hazards that would otherwise be preventable. Sex Workers—particularly prostitutes— constitute some of the most socially isolated and politically marginalized individuals in the nation.Mathieu, L. (2003). The emergence and uncertain outcomes of prostitutes' social movements. The European Journal of Women's Studies, 10(1), 29-50. Some medical clinicians assume that the primary health concern of sex workers must be sexually transmitted infections or HIV prevention, while the stated health concerns of sex workers outside of STIs and HIV are met with minimal care or insensitive and disrespectful treatment. Sex Workers often do not disclose their profession to their health care providers for fear of arrest or of receiving inadequate care, among other concerns.Alexander, P. (1995). Prostitution is sex work: Occupational safety and health (report): National Taskforce on Prostitution.Alexander, P. (1998). Sex work and health: A question of safety in the workplace. Journal of American Medical Women's Association, 53(2), 77-82.Cohan, D., Lutnick, A., Davidson, P., Cloniger, C., Herlyn, A., Breyer, J., et al. (2006). Sex worker health: San Francisco style. Sexually Transmitted Infections. As most sex workers will not identify as such to their providers, existing service organizations are often misinformed or ill-equipped to address the overall occupational health and safety concerns for sex workers that impact their sexual health practices. In the early 1990s COYOTE member Priscilla Alexander developed the program plan for the St. James Infirmary that was founded on a holistic approach towards healthcare for sex workers as determined by the community rather than just focusing on HIV and STI prevention and treatment. Thus, the mission of St. James is to provide compassionate and non-judgmental health care and social services for all sex workers while preventing occupational illnesses and injuries through a comprehensive continuum of services. It is the philosophy of St. James Infirmary to build upon existing skills and strengths in order to allow individuals to determine their own goals while providing culturally competent and non-judgmental services. The Infirmary is run by and serves current and former sex workers from the many sectors of the adult entertainment industry that include escorts, sensual massage workers, exotic dancers, peep show workers, BDSM workers, adult film actors, nude models, Internet pornography workers, street and survival sex workers, phone sex operators, and many more. Since SJI is a multi-service clinic, it challenges centuries of beliefs pertaining to the perceived health needs of the sex worker population. Instead of solely focusing on the sexual health needs of sex workers, the St. James Infirmary combines best practices from Eastern and Western medical to address all the potential holistic health needs of sex workers. The goals of the Infirmary are: # To increase access to primary healthcare and social services for Sex Workers within the San Francisco Bay Area # To increase formalized communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration among individuals and agencies within the San Francisco Bay Area and other areas who serve Sex Workers. # To promote community-based public health initiatives on behalf of Sex Workers, which may be used as a model for improving occupational health and safety standards and developing comprehensive medical and social services for Sex Workers nationally and internationally.

Spanish forces assaulted the British settlement of Nassau in order to seize the island of New Providence. A strong Spanish force of twelve ships and some 1,300 sailors, militia, and soldiers troops attempted to capture the island. Although the Spanish managed to raid outlaying posts the assault on Nassau itself was repelled and the invasion was a failure. Background In 1718, the British sought to regain control of the Bahamas, dominated by pirates, and appointed Captain Woodes Rogers as royal governor. He successfully suppressed pirates, reformed the civil administration and restored trade. By February 1719 Rogers had received news that the Spanish intended to invade and conquer the Bahamas. This large feet which composed of twelve warships and 3,000 troops were diverted to Florida as the French had seized Penascola. Not till the following year was Rogers in a much stronger position after the reconstruction work of Fort Nassau was completed in January 1720. By then, in the Caribbean there was armed aggression between British and Spanish ships due to the clandestine trade of the former. This increased with the outbreak of the War of the Quadruple Alliance and the governor of Cuba, Gregorio Guazo, seeing how Rogers continued to colonise the Bahamas, organised a military force to capture Nassau. Guazo for this attack took advantage of the stay in Havana with three frigates of the Armada de Barlovento, under Commander Francisco Cornejo, increasing his forces with nine privateer brigantines and sloops, crammed with 1,300 to 2,000 men including 1,400 regular soldiers. Raid At the end of February, 1720, the Spaniards from Havana delivered their long delayed attack upon New Providence and sailed through the Florida Straits to reach the island. Rogers had at his disposal Old Fort of Nassau with fifty guns and a ten gun eastern battery. In addition he had around a hundred soldiers and nearly 500 local militia men many of whom were ex pirates. Rogers also had two ships - the Delicia of 32-guns and the frigate HMS Flamborough of 24-guns under Captain Johnathan Hildesley. The Spanish sailed to attack New Providence from the North - the two large warships Principle and Hercules sat out in the deeper water where they anchored themselves. On February 24 Cornejo in the San Jose of 36-guns with the smaller warships including the San Cristoforo of 20-guns and eight sloops unfurled their Spanish colours off Nassau harbour. The Spanish appearance in Nassau caught the British by surprise, but Cornejo however did not directly attack the port due to the presence of Delicia and Flamborough. Rogers nevertheless had to browbeat Hildesley of the latter to stay and defend the island. Cornejo waited for the next day to attack but high winds the following morning but turned into a storm in the afternoon which forced the Spanish to cut their cables and Cornejo had to head for the open sea. The Spanish frigate and the sloops made another attempt, this time to avoid the heavy defences of Fort Nassau. They cruised along Hog Island which sheltered the city's harbour, to the east and West in order to block the entrance. On the night of 25 February the Spaniards attempted to landed three columns on the backside of Hog island and cross the narrow eastern channel in small boats. Quietly they rowed towards the shore but they were met with musket and canon fire. The Spanish in the boats realised that surprised was lost; in confusion and panic they fell back, disembarked and then rowed hard to get out of range. According to the Flamborough's log book, just two black (possibly ex slaves) sentries in a small redoubt repelled this Spanish force. To the West the Spanish made an attempt to land where 500 militia, mostly ex pirates waited. After causing some considerable damage to outlaying property the attack was also repelled which eventually degenerated into a minor skirmishing until the Spanish again withdrew. Later that day another storm hit the Spaniards which eventually forced their withdrawal; the San Cristoforo was found by militia to be wrecked on the Bahama Banks. By 1 March the Spanish had arrived back in Havana which thus ended the threat of invasion. Aftermath After the Spaniards had been repelled, Rogers was unaware of their withdrawal and it wasn't until several weeks that he received a letter from two Englishmen in Havana who had been informed that the Spanish fleet had been hit by a storm which forced their withdrawal. Cornejo having returned to Havana had the consolation of having captured over a hundred captured slaves and considerable booty. Despite repelling the Spanish Rogers throughout the rest of the year had been unable to pay the garrison. With his health failing, he set sail for Charleston on 6 December 1720. The governor had expended his personal fortune on Nassau's defenses. Troubled by the lack of support and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt. Pezuela's account of events Jacabo Pezuela, a Spanish historian tells a completely different tale of events. He does not mention the presence of British ships in the area and says that Cornejo attacked the fort with the fleet, while Cordero, with several companies, occupied Nassau, and that the men of the fort surrendered after three days. Pezuela also states that Rogers had travelled to Bermuda when Cornejo appeared in Nassau. Pezuela says that after the surrender of the fort, 200 men were evacuated with the condition of being transferred to Bermuda. He also says that while the Spanish assault was a success, since the settlers were repulsed into the countryside and the artillery of the fort, 100 slaves and other things were captured, that did not offset the raid expenses.

It fought mostly in Tennessee and western Virginia with help of William Elkins (1812-1870). Formation The 51st Virginia was formed in August 1861, with eleven companies, but Company L was later assigned to the 23rd Virginia Infantry Battalion. Its members were recruited in the counties of Patrick, Wythe, Nelson, Bland, Floyd, and Grayson. During the war it started in General Floyd's and G.C. Wharton's Brigade. Operations The 51st was sent to western Virginia, where it served in the Army of the Kanawha, and saw action at Carnifex Ferry. During the winter of 1861-1862, Wharton's men were transferred with Floyd to Tennessee just in time for the Confederate surrender at the Battle of Fort Donelson, where the 51st escaped and marched back to Nashville with 274 men, and eventually back to Virginia in spring 1862. The regiment returned to Tennessee for the Knoxville Campaign. The unit fought in numerous conflicts in the Shenandoah Valley before being disbanded around April 15, 1865. It reported 9 killed, 43 wounded, and 5 missing at Fort Donelson, and 3 killed and 16 wounded at Fayetteville. Only a handful remained after the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia, in March 1865. Field Officers The field officers were Colonels Augustus Forsberg and Gabriel C. Wharton; Lieutenant Colonels George A. Cunningham, James W. Massie, and John P. Wolfe; and Majors William T. Akers, Stephen M. Dickey, D.P. Graham, D.S. Hounshell, and William A. Yonce. Unit History In June 1861, D. Lee Ross mustered a company of local citizens on his farm in Patrick County, Virginia. 97 men volunteered and elected D. Lee Ross as Captain, and William T. Akers, Abner J. Harbour and C.F.

Two years later, he was chosen as a delegate to the Ohio Constitutional Convention, representing Hamilton county.

Nibley was founded by Mormon businessmen Charles W. Nibley and George E. Stoddard. The two men purchased from A. B. Conley, and the town was named after Charles Nibley. Charles Nibley, David Eccles, and George Stoddard organized the Oregon Sugar Company in 1898 and soon opened the first sugar beet processing plant in the Pacific Northwest in La Grande, which was eventually owned by the Amalgamated Sugar Company. Beet production was less than expected, so the men organized the Oregon Land Company and purchased the Nibley property in 1900 to attract experienced beet farmers from their home state of Utah. By 1902 Nibley was a flourishing village with 20 families and a post office, but beet production continued to be low because of lack of water (as Nibley anticipated irrigation becoming available) and unfavorable weather. In 1905 there was a typhoid epidemic and more bad weather. The Oregon Sugar Company factory in La Grande was closed in 1906, the town ceased to exist on December 29, 1906, and the post office shut down. As a company town, Nibley was not considered a proper town by some historians. Nibley, Utah was also named for Charles W. Nibley.

It is native to southern Africa, but it is well known on other continents such as North America and Australia. However, in the latter continents, it is known as an introduced species and sometimes as a noxious weed. It is an annual or perennial grass which may grow up to a meter tall, and its growth rate is dependent on temperature. The inflorescence is an open array of branches bearing spikelets densely coated in silky white or pink hairs.

The team began play at Marinelli Field in downtown Rockford in 2010. The team is a member of the Midwest Collegiate League and consists of college players playing in collegiate summer ball leagues. Team history The Rockford Foresters, an amateur team, were formed by Owner and Team President Joe Stefani of Three Strikes Baseball and other investors including a former owner of the American Hockey League's Rockford IceHogs. The team was formally announced in November, and the team announced the team name and logo at a press conference at the Rockford Park District on January 13, 2010.

The Rockford Foresters drew 921 fans for their opener, a 3-2 win over the Chicago Zephyrs. In their first season at Marinelli Field, the Foresters won the league's Championship. In 2011, the Foresters took their team to the Championship Series, where they lost in game three against the Will County CrackerJacks.http://rockfordforesters.com/marinelli/history/ Marinelli Field The Foresters will play home games at Marinelli Field. The stadium was built for the Rockford Expos, a minor league baseball team affiliated with the Montreal Expos, in 1988 and later housed the Rockford Cubbies. Marinelli Field's capacity was reduced following the RiverHawks' move into their new stadium. Marinelli now has a capacity of 2,357 with 100 Level and 200 Level seats. For the Foresters, there will be three party decks, consisting of 20, 40 and 75 person groups. Midwest Collegiate League The Midwest Collegiate League is an amateur league/wood bat collegiate league that was started as the Great Plains Baseball League and was rebranded as the Midwest Collegiate League in 2011. The players are all college players playing summer college ball, who play in the NCAA, NJCAA, and NAIA. Former Wood Bat Players who have played in different leagues in Illinois include Jonathan Papelbon, Neal Cotts, Kirby Puckett, Ryan Howard, and Joe Girardi. Players that play in the Midwest Collegiate League come from a variety of colleges and universities. Over 50% of players in the Midwest Collegiate League in 2012 will be from Division I programs.

It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia. The 53rd Virginia was organized in December 1861, by consolidating Tomlin's and Montague's Battalions, and Waddill's Infantry Company. Many of the men were recruited in Halifax, New Kent, Charles City, and Pittsylvania counties. It was assigned to General Armistead's, Barton's, and Steuart's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. The unit was active from Seven Pines to Gettysburg, served in North Carolina, then fought at Drewry's Bluff and Cold Harbor. Later it participated in the long Petersburg siege north of the James River and the Appomattox Campaign. This regiment contained 468 effectives in June, 1862, lost 31 of the 128 engaged at Malvern Hill, and reported 11 casualties during the Maryland Campaign. Of the 435 who saw action at Gettysburg more than thirty percent were disabled, and there were 3 killed, 33 wounded, and 3 missing at Drewry's Bluff. Many were captured at Sayler's Creek, and 6 officers and 74 men surrendered on April 9, 1865. The field officers were Colonels William E. Starke, William R. Aylett, John Grammar, Jr., Carter L.

McClellan (born March 22, 1950) is an American concert promoter and educator. For 30 years he worked at a series of nightclubs housed in a former bus depot at the corner of First Avenue and 7th Street in downtown Minneapolis, promoting the careers of local musicians and expanding the reach of talent from around the world. These clubs—beginning with The Depot, Uncle Sam's, and Sam's (and 7th St. Entry)—eventually became the First Avenue & 7th St. Entry nightclub that contributed to the development of alternative rock and independent music,\\"pointing out the profound debt the alternative rock boom of the nineties owed to bands like Husker Du and the Replacements\\" in and buoyed the Minneapolis sound.\\"For all the commercial success, however, one of the lasting legacies of the Minneapolis Sound goes far deeper than album sales and tour productions. What is truly remarkable, in a city like Minneapolis, is that Prince and his peers would consistently perform their mixed-genre music to integrated and loving audiences, starting at that crossover show in March 1981 and continuing through decades of playing the most esteemed rooms and cavernous arenas in the metro area....\\" in McClellan is number 1 on a list of Unforgettable Minnesota Characters. At First Avenue, a music critic gave him the nickname \\"Chainsaw.\\" Later, he taught music business and arts management at colleges in the Twin Cities. McClellan founded DEMO (originally as DMAF later DAMF) in 1999 to help aspiring musicians succeed. Early life McClellan is the second-oldest of eleven children born to Robert T. McClellan, a U.S. Marine and decorated World War II fighter pilot, and Betty Brancheau. He grew up in a Catholic family in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He graduated from DeLaSalle High School in 1968,Riemenschneider, p. 49. and attended the University of Minnesota. McClellan worked for the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG) and wanted to join Ralph Nader's organization. First Avenue Called The Depot, then Uncle Sam's, then just Sam's, the club was renamed First Avenue in 1981. In 1973, McClellan worked as a bar-back at Uncle Sam's, when it was run as a disco by the American Avents Corporation of Cincinnati from 1972 until 1979. American Avents, who operated in many U.S. cities, liked him and sent him to management training in Des Moines, Iowa, and Lincoln, Nebraska.Riemenschneider, p. 50. In 1980 Allan Fingerhut regained control of the business, and hired the partnership of McClellan and Jack Meyers (and later Dan Lessard) to manage the club. A McClellan booking in 1979, the Ramones, ushered disco out and in its place came punk and live rock and roll. For a few years, dance nights, ladies nights and male strippers in the main room paid the bills, but, on a shoestring budget, the annex 7th Street Entry opened in 1980, the fruit of a 1500 investment in a former coat room.Riemenschneider, pp. 61, 68. Prince $2500 plus part of the gross to play First Avenue in 1981, when black musicians could not usually play downtown. McClellan became a talent buyer, the marketing director and eventually the general manager. Martin Keller describes McClellan's expansive bookings: \\"exotic Afro-pop, speed metal, funk, reggae, punk, pop, folk-rock, country rock, hip hop, and the occasional jazz and comedy acts\\".Keller, pp. 191–192. Working against the grain of segregation in Minneapolis which was hostile to the idea of black audiences, and of black musicians playing downtown, in the late 1970s McClellan booked black bands, notably Jimmy Jam in the eleven-piece Mind & Matter (and later Flyte Tyme and The Time). In 1981 following the one-hit wonder Lipps Inc., he booked Prince for the first of what would be nine full-blown concerts.Mind & Matter, Flyte Tyme, Lipps Inc., Prince in Riemenschneider, pp. 88–89. Chris Riemenschneider quotes McClellan, \\"It was so exciting in the early '80s to see Prince mix the audiences, the racial diversity he brought.\\"Riemenschneider, pp. 85, 88. Sam's was renamed First Avenue on New Year's Eve in 1981. McClellan earned the nickname \\"Chainsaw\\" from music critic P.D. Larson.Keller, p. 192. As general manager, McClellan championed local talent and made performance space for Prince, Hüsker Dü, The Replacements, the Wallets, The Time, The Suburbs, Soul Asylum, and The Jayhawks. He promoted Nirvana, U2, Green Day, and R.E.M., the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Run-DMC all early in their careers. He also presented legacy acts such as Tina Turner, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Ray Charles to sold-out crowds.Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run-DMC, Tina Turner, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Ray Charles in Remembering the era's wild west of settlement with artists, Frank Riley thought McClellan was one of perhaps three \\"really reliable\\" promoters in the United States. Some of the contracts he signed with hundreds of groups from around the world can be seen online at the Minnesota Historical Society. Teaching and other associations McClellan in 2019 at the Museum of Minnesota Music and HiFi Records. Photo courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society. After leaving First Avenue in 2004, McClellan taught music business at Globe University and Minnesota School of Business which since then has ceased operations, and later taught arts management at the now-defunct McNally Smith College of Music in Saint Paul. He has served on the boards of Cedar Cultural Center, KFAI radio, Minnesota Public Interest Research Group and the Downtown Warehouse Association. As of 2019, he is a part-time bartender at the Schooner Tavern in south Minneapolis.Keller, p. 194. DEMO In 1999, McClellan founded the non-profit DMAF (Developing Music and Arts Foundation) which in 2004 was rechristened DEMO (Diverse Emerging Music Organization) where he works to promote and educate developing musicians. He told Minnesota Public Radio in a 2014 interview that it is not the bottom line, but rather the \\"street level stuff\\" that is important. He also said to MPR in 2005 that he believes the cutting edge of music \\"is in the Twin Cities growing immigrant communities\\". Many of The Naked Songwriter series by DEMO were recorded at Orfield Laboratories. Despite his stated dislike of recordings, McClellan wrote the liner notes for The Bootlegs Volume 1: Celebrating 35 years of First Avenue, proceeds from which go to DEMO. Personal life McClellan claimed in early 2016 to ever have voted for only two major party candidates, George McGovern and Barack Obama. Instead, he much preferred third party politics. McClellan's American Avents Corporation award for Rookie of the Year McClellan was married to Cindy Lawson, singer and guitarist for the Clams, and they have two daughters.Riemenschneider, p. 126. Brian Lambert of MinnPost describes him as, \\"dare we say, extraordinarily colorful\\". Jon Bream of the Star Tribune called him, \\"Quirky, cranky, verbosely opinionated and hugely influential\\". Awards and honors After he became a manager at Uncle Sam's, American Avents named him Rookie of the Year in 1977. McClellan won the Connie Hector Award at the 1996 Minnesota Music Awards. In 2015 on McClellan's 65th birthday, mayor of Minneapolis, Betsy Hodges, and mayor of Saint Paul, Chris Coleman, celebrated a Steve McClellan Day with proclamations.

MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 792 Workman Publishing 2001 Located in South Australia, the Barossa Valley is about 56 km (35 miles) northeast of the city of Adelaide. Unlike most of Australia whose wine industry was heavily influenced by the British, the wine industry of the Barossa Valley was founded by German settlers fleeing persecution from the Prussian province of SilesiaN. Parode \\"Barossa Valley: Australia's Flagship Wine Region\\" Into Wine, Accessed: 15 January 2010 (in what is now Poland). The warm continental climate of the region promoted the production of very ripe grapes that was the linchpin of the early Australian fortified wine industry. As the modern Australian wine industry shifted towards red table wines (particularly those made by the prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon) in the mid-20th century, the Barossa Valley fell out of favor due to its reputation for being largely a Syrah from producers whose grapes were destined for blending. During this period the name \\"Barossa Valley\\" rarely appeared on wine labels. In the 1980s, the emergence of several boutique families specializing in old vine Shiraz wines began to capture international attention for the distinctive style of Barossa Shiraz, a full bodied red wine with rich chocolate and spice notes. This led to a renaissance in the Barossa Valley which catapulted the region to the forefront of the Australian wine industry.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 312-314 Abbeville Press 2003 Many of Australia's largest and most notable wineries are either headquartered or own extensive holdings in the Barossa Valley. These include such wineries as Penfolds, Peter Lehmann, Orlando Wines, Seppeltsfield, Wolf Blass and Yalumba. Many Shiraz vines in the Barossa Valley are several decades old, with some vineyards planted with old vines that are 100–150 years old including Turkey Flat in Tanunda that is home to the oldest commercially producing grape vines, originally planted in 1847.G. Harding \\"A Wine Miscellany\\" pg 20, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 Other grape varieties grown in the Barossa Valley include Grenache, Mourvedre, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling, Chardonnay and Semillon.A. Bespaloff Complete Guide to Wine pg 286 Penguin Books 1994 In February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that special legislation would be introduced to protect the unique heritage of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. Premier Rann said: \\"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide.\\"891 ABC, 9 February 2011:\\"No Urban Sprawl into Wine Region\\" The Character Preservation (Barossa Valley) Act 2012 was subsequently passed by the South Australian Parliament. History George Angas and the South Australian Company promised Sileasian refugees safe passage and land in the Barossa Valley, ushering in the Germanic influence that would shape the Barossa wine industry. In December 1837 an expedition led Colonel William Light and was surveyed in 1839 by his assistant surveyor, William Jacob (1814–1902), as part of a wider survey of the Barossa region. Light chose the name in memory of the British victory over the French in the Battle of Barrosa', in which he fought in 1811. The name \\"Barossa\\" was registered in error, due to a clerical error in transcribing the name \\"Barrosa\\". While most of Australia's wine industry was directly influenced by the involvement of the British, the Barossa Valley was shaped by the influence of German settlers fleeing persecution from the Prussian province of Silesia.Max Allen, The History of Australian Wine: Stories From the Vineyard to the Cellar Room, Carlton, Victoria: Victory Books, 2012, p. 91 In 1841, the South Australian Company (under orders of one of its shareholders George Fife Angas) chartered three ships to Silesia to offer refuge and land in the Barossa Valley to any settler willing to volunteer to help establish the colony. Nearly 500 families accepted the offer and settled in the Barossa Valley. After trying many types of agricultural crops, the settlers found the warm fertile valley to be ideally suited for viticulture. The early years of the Barossa Valley winemaking ushered in a long period of trial and error for while the settlers were skilled farmers, their previous homeland of Silesia had little to no winemaking tradition.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 348-349 Simon and Schuster 1989 The early focus of the Barossa Valley wine industry was on the production of Riesling, a German wine grape from the Rhineland. The hot valley floor contributed to a very ripe, alcoholic wine that would often turn brown. Some of this wine was eventually distilled in brandy which ushered in a period of fortified wine production that coincided with the plantings of many red grape wine varieties like Shiraz and Grenache. These \\"port-style wines\\" would become the center of the Barossa Valley wine industry for decades to come. When the focus on the Australian wine industry shifted in the mid-20th century to production of premium, non-fortified wines, the Barossa Valley was regarded as an \\"inferior\\" wine region compared to cooler climate regions such as Coonawarra and Padthaway. This was partly due to the extensive association that the Barossa Valley had with Shiraz, including vast old vines plantings that were several decades old. During this period Shiraz was considered a very \\"common\\" variety that was not as fashionable as the prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon that was popular in the world's wine market.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pp. 308–309 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Most of the grapes produced in the Barossa Valley during this time was used as part of anonymous blends with the name \\"Barossa Valley\\" rarely appearing on wine labels. By the late 20th century, the reputation of the Barossa Valley started to change as several small boutique varieties began earning critical acclaim for their Barossa Valley wines. In particular, Barossa Shiraz became so well known internationally that it was considered its own unique style of Syrah that was distinctive of the grape's expression in other regions like Côte- Rôtie, Châteauneuf-du-Pape and California. This style of big, full bodied Shiraz with rich, chocolate and spice notes became synonymous with not only the Barossa Valley but with Australian wine in general. In the words of Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the Barossa Valley became \\"Australia's quintessential wine region\\". Climate and geography The foothills of the Barossa Ranges offers macroclimates that are quite distinct from the flatter valley floor vineyards featured in lead picture above. In general the Barossa Valley has a continental climate but its series of transverse valleys and sloping hills does produce a wide range of mesoclimates. Temperatures vary from very warm on the valley floors to progressively cooler at higher altitudes on the hillsides and further North in the valley. Despite its reputation as a \\"warm climate region\\", many of the Barossa Valley's climate figures are not that dissimilar from the relatively cooler Margaret River in Western Australia-though the Barossa Valley does have a wider diurnal temperature range. During the heat summation and mean temperatures during the October to April growing season, the region receives about 1710 heating degree days with mean average temperatures during the crucial ripening month of January being around 70 °F (21.4 °C). Rainfall during the growing season averages only around 6.3 inches (160mm), with average relative humidity around 39%,Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation \\"Barossa Valley \\" Official Site, Australian Government. Accessed: 13 January 2010 which means that viticultural irrigation is often used. The exception is many of the old vine vineyards on the slightly cooler western side of the valley which is often dry-farmed without irrigation. Viticulture and winemaking Grapes in the Barossa Valley can get very ripe with high sugar and low acid levels. Most of the Barossa Valley makes extensive use of irrigation to supplement the region's low rainfall supply during the growing season. However, concerns about water supply in the late 20th and early 21st century led to the development of strict regulations on the numbers and locations of irrigation boreholes as well as the amount of water that can be used by vineyards.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 578-580 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Some of the region's oldest vineyards, especially those on the slightly cooler west side of the valley, practice dryland farming. The increased water stress of the practice, coupled with the naturally reduced yields of old vines, tends to produce the most deeply concentrated grapes in the valley which often go into the Barossa Valley 's most expensive and sought after wines. Harvest usually begins in February and may be conducted in the cooler temperatures of night to help maintain acid levels. The generally hot climate of the Barossa Valley usually means that the grapes become ripe very easily with high levels of sugars and low levels of acids. Winemaking in the Barossa Valley often utilizes the process of acidification in order to add balance to the wine. The high alcohol levels from the fermented sugars may be offset by various winemaking practices including reverse osmosis and adding water to the must. Historically, winemakers in the Barossa Valley have utilized very short maceration periods that limit the amount of time that the wines spends in contact with the skin. Often the wine is racked off the skins into oak wine barrels before fermentation is even completed. While this does mean that supplemental tannins might need to be added, this short maceration often leaves the wines with a smooth mouthfeel. The extensive use of oak is also a characteristic of Barossa Valley winemaking with American oak, with its more aggressive dill and coconut aroma notes, often used more than French oak. Grapes and wine Many of Australia's most well known wines, such as this Penfolds Shiraz, come from the Barossa Valley. Vineyards in the Barossa Valley at dusk While the Barossa Valley is most commonly associated with its signature grape variety of Shiraz, the region does grow a number of grape varieties. Among these other varieties are Riesling, Semillon, Chardonnay, Grenache, Mourvedre and Cabernet Sauvignon. The popularity of Syrah has sparked interest in the development of other Rhone varieties, with increase production of Grenache and Mourvedre (also known as Mataro in Australia) for both blending and varietal bottlings. Many of these vines are remnants of the Barossa's fortified wine history and such have substantial age themselves. Despite its reputation as a red wine region, the Barossa Valley does produce a large amount of white wine. Riesling has been historically important in the region but has gradually shifted eastward to higher elevations and cooler climates of the Barossa Ranges. Many Rieslings labelled with simply \\"Barossa\\" will often include more grapes from the cooler Eden Valley wine region than the Barossa Valley. This is permitted as the geographical indication of the Barossa Zone also includes the Eden Valley wine region that borders the Barossa Valley wine region to the east and which has developed an international reputation for the quality of its Riesling. The plantings of Semillon in the Barossa Valley have evolved to develop its own unique pink-skinned clone that is distinctive from the Semillon found in its French homeland of Bordeaux or the internationally known Semillon from the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Barossa Semillon is characterized by its full body, golden color and low acidity. Traditionally the wine was fermented in oak but in recent years has been produced more with stainless steel. Barossa Chardonnay is often oaked and subjected to malolactic fermentation which produces a big, full body creamy wine.

His next feature-length film, entitled Lifechanger was released in 2018. Album releases \\"Dear Hip Hop\\", one of Dan-e-o's most well known songs, was released on Beat Factory's Rap Essentials Volume One album in 1996. The CD included artists from all over Canada that have at one point toured Canada with Dan-e-o including Rascalz, Kardinal Offishall and Choclair.

Tha Indy Wrestling Album, an album containing theme songs of several Ontario indy professional wrestlers that features performances from himself, T.J. Habibi, Chemist, Tika Simone and Summer Brockwell. In November 2009, Dan-e-o released a 2 in 1 album/mixtape entitled Dilla Pickles in honor of the late hip-hop producer, J Dilla.

In 2019, Dan- e-o released his fifth solo album, The Day It All Changed, an ode to his daughter, Melina, who appears on the album cover with him.  Tha O Show  In mid-February 2006, Dan-e-o joined with friend, Big Daddy Donnie to launch Tha O Show, a website based in Toronto. In the beginning, it consisted of articles and weekly reviews of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts shows, but later on would turn into what the pair had envisioned all along: a weekly online radio program that broadcasts on Tha O Show's website and on dozens of affiliate sites. The show carved out a niche as a unique radio property, catering to an audience that loves wrestling and MMA, but wanted to hear about other things as well. The show often featured an in-studio guest or co-host who was a professional wrestler, as well as guests on the phone. Tha O Show avoids typical \\"interview\\" format and instead strives for a more conversational approach - best noted by their Round Table segment. Dan-e-o stepped down in June 2012 as official co-host of Tha O Show, being replaced by professional wrestler and Big Daddy Donnie's former co-host on Live Audio Wrestling, Notorious T.I.D.. Tha O Show officially went off the air by the end of 2013. In March of 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, Donnie, Tid and Dan reunited with a new podcast known as \\"The Godfathers of Podcasting\\".

It moved to Tennessee and was attached to Floyd's Brigade, and was captured in the fight at Fort Donelson. After being exchanged, the unit returned to Virginia and was assigned to Pickett's, Garnett's, and Hunton's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia.

The 56th then endured the hardships of the Petersburg trenches north and south of the James River and saw action around Appomattox. In June 1862, it contained 466 effectives and reported 100 casualties during the Seven Days' Battles. This regiment carried only 40 men into action at Sharpsburg and eight were wounded. Of the 289 engaged at Gettysburg, more than 65 percent were disabled. Many were captured at Sayler's Creek, and only three officers and 26 men surrendered on April 9, 1865.

The corporation kept highly detailed accounts of their operation, a great deal of which survives to this day. After a successful period of four centuries, surviving plague and many other challenges governance of the borough descended into chaos after the restoration in 1660. This lasted until new structures were imposed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 which created the municipal borough of Ipswich. Since the Local Government Act 1972 Ipswich has been a non- metropolitan district with borough status. History=Early years King John granted a royal charter to the town in 1200. Unusually, they immediately resolved to record proceedings in 'Great Domesday Book of Ipswich'. The original documents were stolen in 1272. Its contents were however already noted and a new copy was made later. In 1290 'The Little domesday book of Ipswich' was compiled based on what could be recollected at the time. A further copy was made in the 14th century.Twinch (2008), page 30 In 1611 the corporation 'adventured', £100 towards the cost of ships to sail to Jamestown, in Virginia 13 years before The Mayflower./ Following the restoration in 1660 the governance of the corporation declined until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 again brought order. The borough was both subject to disastrous manipulation by Charles II and James II and also by the rise of party politics.Martin (2000), page xxxvi The town was strongly puritan and during the winter of 1662/63 Royal commissioners arrived to enforce the Corporation Act 1661 and ask all officeholders and freeman to renounce the 'Puritan Covenant'. Half of the assembly were purged. In 1684 the charter was then called in and replaced by another which named to new officeholders and for the first time in its history Portmen were imposed on the town many of whom were outsiders, Freemen were refused participation in the borough government.Martin (2000), page xxxvii The aim was to create a compliant closed corporation. Control over the Holy Rood Fair which took place on St Margaret's Green was passed to the Corporation.Twinch (2008), page 19 A further charter was imposed by James II in 1688 without revoking the earlier charter and the result was confusion and chaos and permanent problems in 1835. In 1719 the corporation blocked proposals to make the River Orwell navigable as far as Stowmarket; further plans were raised in 1790 and the work was completed by 1793 after which numerous maltings were soon operating in Stowmarket. Until the Reform Act 1832 Members of parliament for Ipswich were selected for the Ipswich Parliament constituency by the Ipswich Corporation. Elections during the 18th century in the town sometimes descended into physical fights between 'The Blues' (who supported the conservatives) and 'The Yellows' (who supported the Whigs or Liberals) with the behaviour of the politicians being described as 'miserable' and local and national elections often ending in a competition of who could be bribed and for what price.Twinch (2008), page 78 Following the Reform Act 1832 all male householders living in properties worth at least ten pounds a year were given the right to vote and process of voter registration. The act was intended to \\"take effectual Measures for correcting diverse Abuses that have long prevailed in the Choice of Members to serve in the Commons House of Parliament.\\" From 1835 to 1889 The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 created the municipal borough of Ipswich. This followed an investigation into municipal corporations which had concluded that the existing Municipal Corporations of England and Wales neither possess nor deserve the confidence or respect of Your Majesty's subjects Subsequent to the 1835 Act a mayor was elected, together with a High Steward, Recorder, ten Aldermen and thirty Councillors. Between 1835 and 1842 there were five parliamentary elections and all were found to have been corrupt and in all seven members of parliament were unseated. In 1841 votes were openly for sale at £15. W.C. Fonnereau leased of Christchurch Park to the corporation in 1851. The Municipal Corporations Act 1882 gave powers to the corporation to make byelaws and to acquire land and buildings. County Borough of Ipswich 1888-1974 Following the Local Government Act 1888 the county of Suffolk was split into East Suffolk and West Suffolk for administrative purposes and the term administrative county was introduced. Ipswich was retained its independence as the County Borough of Ipswich. In 1895 Felix Cobbold gave Christchurch Mansion to the town on condition that the corporation buys the rest of the property who completed the purchase later in the year. In 1901 the corporation purchased the town's tram system from Ipswich Tramway Company as authorised by the Ipswich Corporation Act of 1900. In 1903, the corporation purchased one of six packages of land which was formerly part of the Hill House Estate and home of the Byles family and created Alexandra Park, named after the wife of Edward VII. In 1927 the land where Chantry Park is now situated had been sold for housing development and was then purchased by Sir Arthur Churchman (later Lord Woodbridge) who then gave it to Ipswich Corporation to be held in permanent trust for the people of Ipswich. In 1929 the corporation purchased of land to create a municipal airport for Ipswich. Ipswich Airport was constructed the following year and was then officially opened by H.R.H. Prince Edward on 26 June 1930 who described the facility as \\"one of the finest in the country\\". In 1973 Anglian Water Authority was formed by the Water Act 1973 and took over various services run by the corporation. The county borough of Ipswich was abolished in 1974 following the Local Government Act 1972 and Ipswich became a non-metropolitan district with borough status.

The club was founded by Hungarian migrants in 1957 and quickly became one of the strongest football clubs in Australia in the 1960s and 1970s.OzFootball Club Profile History The foundations of the Melbourne Hungaria begin with the 1956 Olympics held in Melbourne. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 had just been crushed by the Soviet Union forces in the weeks before the Olympics, creating a politically charged atmosphere for the Hungarian Olympic team in Melbourne. Following the completion of the Olympics as many as half of the Hungarian delegation defected, many choosing to stay in Australia. This included members of the Hungarian Olympic soccer team. In 1957 these members of the Olympic soccer team founded the Melbourne Hungaria Soccer Club,Australian soccer history which was one of many ethnic-based soccer teams founded at the time. From 1960 to 1975 the club competed successfully in the Victorian State League, with the stand out year being 1967 under Irish coach Billy Walsh when the club won its one and only Victorian State League championship. That year the club also went on to win its biggest prize the Australian Cup, defeating Apia Leichhardt 4–3 in the Final at Olympic Park.Australian Cup history The club’s most notable player, former Socceroo Attila Abonyi, scored a hat-trick in the Final. In 1975 the club finished bottom of the ladder and was relegated from the state League; this saw the club struggle for the next decade as they bounced between Division 1 and Division 2. Finally in 1985 the club had its most successful season since the early 1970s as they took out the Division 1 championship to finally be promoted back to the State League. The club's second stint in the State league would be short lived as it finished in bottom spot in 1986 to drop straight back down to Division 1. The following season of 1987 proved to be the last for Melbourne Hungaria as the club struggling to stay afloat finally closed its doors after the completion of the season.

He worked primarily on Central American and Caribbean populations. Life and career  Steggerda was born in Holland, Michigan, the son of Sena (Ter Vree) and John Steggerda.http://jointarchives.org/collections/overlay/steggerd.html He was of Dutch descent. He received an A.B. from Hope College in 1922, and an A.M. and Ph.D from the Department of Zoology of the University of Illinois, in 1923 and 1928 respectively. His first academic position was as assistant professor of zoology at Smith College (1928–30), but most of his career was spent as an investigator with the Carnegie Institution for Science at Cold Spring Harbor, New York (1930–44). From then until his death of a heart attack on March 15, 1950, he was professor of Anthropology at Hartford Seminary Foundation in Connecticut. During World War II, he assisted the Office of Strategic Services, specifically with a \\"1943 OSS document, the 'Preliminary Report on Japanese Anthropology,' ... which reveals that World War II-era anthropologists were recommending culture- and race-specific means of killing Japanese soldiers and civilians.\\" He was an honorary member of the American Eugenics Society, and a council member of the American Anthropological Association. He was a founding member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in 1930, and subsequently served on its Executive Committee and as its vice president. Steggerda's academic biography and complete list of publications was published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology Vol. 9 N.S., No. 1, March 1951. It reveals a diversity of research topics and questions ranging from fingerprints, anthropometry, heredity, metabolism, family genealogies and histories. Among this work are a study of the anthropometry of Smith College coeds from 1929 and a study of the detrimental effects of feeding a pigeon polished rice versus brown rice. Steggerda joined the Division of Historical Research of the Carnegie Institution of Washington as part of the changes brought about with the hiring of Alfred V. Kidder as director of this research unit. Both the change in the leadership of the CIW archaeology research (including its restructuring into the Division of Historical Research) and the reassignment of Steggerda (based in the CIW Genetics department) to help out in Maya archaeology were strategic decisions made by the President of the CIW, Merriam Campbell, who as a physical anthropologist interested in holistic evolutionary interpretations of cultures. Steggerda's ethnographic based research in the community of Pisté, three kilometers from Chichen Itza provides data ranging from the profundity of soils from his experimental garden, complete descriptions of all architecture in the community within a five-year period (1933−1938), and meticulous anthropometry of the nearly 500 members of the community to useful social histories, a study of Maya fingerprints, and complete census materials for the 1930s. Steggerda conducted eight years of research in Pisté. The corpus of his research materials formed the basis for an ethnographic research project in the 1990s directed by Quetzil Castaneda. The materials were curated in an interactive exhibition for the community to engage in the town hall over a three-day period. See also project description at www.osea- cite.org/history/chilam.php Academic work Some of his work was done in collaboration with the eugenicist Charles Davenport, with whom he wrote the book Race Crossing in Jamaica, published in 1929. Despite his clear racial and specifically eugenic approach to human diversity, Steggerda was a bit different in interpretive outlook than his Davenport. While Davenport converted the slightest bit of data or non-data into racial ideology, Steggerda was exceptionally circumspect. He was methodical and precise and did not make interpretations that exceeded the methods and data employed in his research. No doubt this is one aspect to the collaboration between Steggerda and Davenport: Steggerda did the methodical work and Davenport did the interpretive exegesis of racial \\"hybridization.\\" Publications=Books *Steggerda, Morris.

Taking his place was supposed to be Brady Leman of Calgary, Alberta. However, Leman aggravated a broken tibia he suffered the previous year and was also unable to compete. Replacing both of them was Davey Barr of Brackendale, British Columbia. Duncan competed for Canada at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and finished eighth in ski cross. On February 24, he, along with his wife Maja and technical ski coach Willy Raine, were arrested in Pyeongchang for stealing a car while under the influence on their way back to the Olympic Village.

For much of pteridological history, it was regarded as a reduced form or variety of Pellaea atropurpurea. P. glabella is known to exist in two cryptic species, one diploid and one tetraploid. The diploid reproduces sexually, while the tetraploid is normally apogamous. It is now known that the tetraploid form of the species is one of the parents of the original hybrid P. × atropurpurea that became the apogamous species. P. glabella is epipetric, normally growing on well-weathered limestone. It favors more exposed sites than P. atropurpurea. This species is distinguished by its sessile or nearly sessile pinnae and smooth, not hairy, stipes. P. glabella has been assigned a total of four subspecies: * Pellaea glabella subsp. glabella Mettenius ex Kuhn * Pellaea glabella subsp. missouriensis (G. J.

His first evasion earned him the nickname of Half-hanged Smith. Biography=Early life and career John Smith was the son of a Malton farmer. He was apprenticed by a packer, and served him as a journeyman. He then went on to serve the navy, first in a merchantman, then in a man-of-war, and was discharged after the Battle of Vigo Bay. Soon after that, he enlisted as a soldier, where he acquainted with bad associates and started his career as a housebreaker. First conviction On 5 December 1705, Smith was accused of four indictments and was convicted of two of them, and was sentenced to death. He showed little concern over his sentence until his execution was ordered on the Christmas Eve of the same year. He was taken to the Tyburn gallows where he was hanged. Smith's family and friends were present at his hanging. Some attempted to tug at his legs to shorten his suffering, while others held them up for the mere possibility that Smith would not die. Others fought over the body with anatomists. After hanging for a quarter of an hour, the people cried out 'A reprieve'! The reprieve was granted, and Smith was cut down. He was taken to a house in the neighbourhood, where he recovered. When asked what his feelings were during the execution, Smith replied: Smith was granted freedom a few months later, on 20 February 1706. Second and third convictions John Smith turned back to housebreaking upon release. He was tried at the Old Bailey. Due to some complications of his case, the jury left the verdict to the twelve judges. The judges decided to set him free. There appeared to be no hope for Smith on his third prosecution. It seemed as if the judge would certainly sentence him to an execution once and for all. However, the prosecutor died on the day before the trial was to commence, and Smith was once again set free. Final conviction and transportation On 17 May 1727, 66-year-old Smith (using the name John Wilson) was found stealing a padlock. Two watchmen had seen him and another man trying to steal the padlock, so they went up to investigate. The other man escaped, but Smith was found with eight picklock keys. Smith attempted to get rid of the padlock, although the padlock was later found in the 'Channel'. Although it was agreed that Smith had intended to burgle the warehouse, Smith was only found guilty of theft. He was sentenced to transportation to Virginia. He then lodged an appeal to Sir John Eyles Knight, the Lord Mayor, requesting for physical punishment in lieu of transportation. In spite of his physical disabilities and role as a father of two children, the court took no pity on him and he was taken to Virginia on the Susannah.

His job inquiries led him to connect with Mike Tannenbaum, then the pro personnel director of the New York Jets. Tannenbaum interviewed Roseman for a player personnel intern position in 1999, but he did not get the job. Professional career After another pursuit, Roseman was hired by the Philadelphia Eagles as an intern to work on salary cap issues in 2000. He was promoted to director of football administration in 2003 and was later promoted to vice president of football administration in 2006. Roseman continued to climb the Eagles front office ladder, serving as the vice president of player personnel for two years before being named the Eagles general manager on January 29, 2010 after Tom Heckert was hired by the Cleveland Browns in the same role. Although he had the title of general manager, Roseman served mainly in an advisory role to head coach and executive vice president of football operations Andy Reid, who had the final say in football matters. Within his first season as general manager, Roseman went to work on the Eagles’ roster, building it into one of the youngest in the league. That revamped Eagles squad earned an NFC East division championship in 2010. Three years later, Roseman assisted Eagles chairman Jeffrey Lurie in the team's search for a new head coach in 2013, which ended with University of Oregon coach Chip Kelly coming to Philadelphia. Kelly, like Reid, had the final say over the 53-man roster, so Roseman continued to serve mainly in an advisory role. In their first season together in Philadelphia, Roseman and Kelly oversaw an Eagles team that won 10 games and a division championship, quite the turnaround from the team's 4-12 record in 2012. Among Roseman's roles as the general manager, he oversaw the Eagles’ college and pro scouting departments, the team's medical, equipment, and video staffs, while also controlling the team's salary cap and supervising team security. In a change of front office structure, on January 2, 2015, Kelly was given general manager duties while Roseman was promoted to Executive Vice President of Football Operations. In this role, Roseman continued directing contract negotiations, managing the team's salary and also overseeing the team's medical staff, equipment staff and more. After Kelly's dismissal, Roseman became the de facto GM again in 2016, and hired Doug Pederson as the Eagles' new head coach. Roseman helped the Eagles win Super Bowl LII when the team defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in 2018. He was promoted to executive vice president/general manager on June 13, 2019. Roseman also plays a large role in the Eagles' community efforts, contributing to a number of initiatives involving military and children. Roseman's charitable endeavors have benefited Eagles Youth Partnership, the team's public charity which serves over 50,000 low income children in the Greater Philadelphia region every year with a focus on health and education programming, as well as Eagles Care. In addition, Roseman has also worked with Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, USA Football, Pop Warner and Cop Wheels. He was named Honorary Commander for the Joint Base McGuire-Dix- Lakehurst for his continued efforts with the military. Personal life Roseman earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Florida before earning a JD degree from Fordham Law School. Howie and his wife, Mindy, reside in Philadelphia with their four children.

Compatibility is the study of the conditions under which such a displacement field can be guaranteed. Compatibility conditions are particular cases of integrability conditions and were first derived for linear elasticity by Barré de Saint-Venant in 1864 and proved rigorously by Beltrami in 1886.C Amrouche, PG Ciarlet, L Gratie, S Kesavan, On Saint Venant's compatibility conditions and Poincaré's lemma, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I, 342 (2006), 887-891. In the continuum description of a solid body we imagine the body to be composed of a set of infinitesimal volumes or material points. Each volume is assumed to be connected to its neighbors without any gaps or overlaps. Certain mathematical conditions have to be satisfied to ensure that gaps/overlaps do not develop when a continuum body is deformed. A body that deforms without developing any gaps/overlaps is called a compatible body. Compatibility conditions are mathematical conditions that determine whether a particular deformation will leave a body in a compatible state.Barber, J. R., 2002, Elasticity - 2nd Ed., Kluwer Academic Publications. In the context of infinitesimal strain theory, these conditions are equivalent to stating that the displacements in a body can be obtained by integrating the strains. Such an integration is possible if the Saint-Venant's tensor (or incompatibility tensor) \\\\boldsymbol{R}(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}) vanishes in a simply-connected bodyN.I. Muskhelishvili, Some Basic Problems of the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity. Leyden: Noordhoff Intern. Publ., 1975. where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} is the infinitesimal strain tensor and : \\\\boldsymbol{R} := \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}) = \\\\boldsymbol{0} ~. For finite deformations the compatibility conditions take the form : \\\\boldsymbol{R} :=\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{F} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} where \\\\boldsymbol{F} is the deformation gradient.  Compatibility conditions for infinitesimal strains  The compatibility conditions in linear elasticity are obtained by observing that there are six strain-displacement relations that are functions of only three unknown displacements. This suggests that the three displacements may be removed from the system of equations without loss of information. The resulting expressions in terms of only the strains provide constraints on the possible forms of a strain field.  2-dimensions  For two-dimensional, plane strain problems the strain-displacement relations are : \\\\varepsilon_{11} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial u_1}{\\\\partial x_1} ~;~~ \\\\varepsilon_{12} = \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial u_{1}}{\\\\partial x_2} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial u_{2}}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right]~;~~ \\\\varepsilon_{22} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial u_{2}}{\\\\partial x_2} Repeated differentiation of these relations, in order to remove the displacements u_1 and u_2, gives us the two-dimensional compatibility condition for strains : \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varepsilon_{11}}{\\\\partial x_2^2} \\\\- 2\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varepsilon_{12}}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} \\\\+ \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varepsilon_{22}}{\\\\partial x_1^2} = 0 The only displacement field that is allowed by a compatible plane strain field is a plane displacement field, i.e., \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{u}(x_1, x_2) .  3-dimensions  In three dimensions, in addition to two more equations of the form seen for two dimensions, there are three more equations of the form : \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varepsilon_{33}}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_3}\\\\left[ \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_{23}}{\\\\partial x_1} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_{31}}{\\\\partial x_2} - \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_{12}}{\\\\partial x_3}\\\\right] Therefore, there are 34=81 partial differential equations however due to symmetry conditions this number reduces to six different compatibility conditions. We can write these conditions in index notation asSlaughter, W. S., 2003, The linearized theory of elasticity, Birkhauser : e_{ikr}~e_{jls}~\\\\varepsilon_{ij,kl} = 0 where e_{ijk} is the permutation symbol. In direct tensor notation : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}) = \\\\boldsymbol{0} where the curl operator can be expressed in an orthonormal coordinate system as \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} = e_{ijk}\\\\varepsilon_{rj,i}\\\\mathbf{e}_k\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{e}_r . The second-order tensor : \\\\boldsymbol{R} := \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}) ~;~~ R_{rs} := e_{ikr}~e_{jls}~\\\\varepsilon_{ij,kl} is known as the incompatibility tensor, and is equivalent to the Saint-Venant compatibility tensor  Compatibility conditions for finite strains  For solids in which the deformations are not required to be small, the compatibility conditions take the form : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{F} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} where \\\\boldsymbol{F} is the deformation gradient. In terms of components with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system we can write these compatibility relations as : e_{ABC}~\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial F_{iB}}{\\\\partial X_A} = 0 This condition is necessary if the deformation is to be continuous and derived from the mapping \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\chi}(\\\\mathbf{X},t) (see Finite strain theory). The same condition is also sufficient to ensure compatibility in a simply connected body.  Compatibility condition for the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor  The compatibility condition for the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can be expressed as : R^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\rho} := \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho}[\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}] - \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}[\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho}] + \\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\rho}~\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} - \\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\beta}~\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho} = 0 where \\\\Gamma^k_{ij} is the Christoffel symbol of the second kind. The quantity R^m_{ijk} represents the mixed components of the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor.  The general compatibility problem  The problem of compatibility in continuum mechanics involves the determination of allowable single-valued continuous fields on simply connected bodies. More precisely, the problem may be stated in the following manner.Acharya, A., 1999, On Compatibility Conditions for the Left Cauchy–Green Deformation Field in Three Dimensions, Journal of Elasticity, Volume 56, Number 2 , 95-105 Figure 1. Motion of a continuum body. Consider the deformation of a body shown in Figure 1. If we express all vectors in terms of the reference coordinate system {(\\\\mathbf{E}_1, \\\\mathbf{E}_2, \\\\mathbf{E}_3), O}, the displacement of a point in the body is given by : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{X} ~;~~ u_i = x_i - X_i Also : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{X}} ~;~~ \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{X}} What conditions on a given second-order tensor field \\\\boldsymbol{A}(\\\\mathbf{X}) on a body are necessary and sufficient so that there exists a unique vector field \\\\mathbf{v}(\\\\mathbf{X}) that satisfies : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\quad \\\\equiv \\\\quad v_{i,j} = A_{ij} Necessary conditions For the necessary conditions we assume that the field \\\\mathbf{v} exists and satisfies v_{i,j} = A_{ij}. Then : v_{i,jk} = A_{ij,k} ~;~~ v_{i,kj} = A_{ik,j} Since changing the order of differentiation does not affect the result we have : v_{i,jk} = v_{i,kj} Hence : A_{ij,k} = A_{ik,j} From the well known identity for the curl of a tensor we get the necessary condition : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{A} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} Sufficient conditions Figure 2. Integration paths used in proving the sufficiency conditions for compatibility. To prove that this condition is sufficient to guarantee existence of a compatible second-order tensor field, we start with the assumption that a field \\\\boldsymbol{A} exists such that \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{A} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} . We will integrate this field to find the vector field \\\\mathbf{v} along a line between points A and B (see Figure 2), i.e., : \\\\mathbf{v}(\\\\mathbf{X}_B) - \\\\mathbf{v}(\\\\mathbf{X}_A) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot~d\\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} \\\\boldsymbol{A}(\\\\mathbf{X})\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} If the vector field \\\\mathbf{v} is to be single-valued then the value of the integral should be independent of the path taken to go from A to B. From Stokes' theorem, the integral of a second order tensor along a closed path is given by : \\\\oint_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\boldsymbol{A}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{s} = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{A})~da Using the assumption that the curl of \\\\boldsymbol{A} is zero, we get : \\\\oint_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\boldsymbol{A}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{s} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\implies \\\\quad \\\\int_{AB} \\\\boldsymbol{A}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} + \\\\int_{BA} \\\\boldsymbol{A}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} = 0 Hence the integral is path independent and the compatibility condition is sufficient to ensure a unique \\\\mathbf{v} field, provided that the body is simply connected.  Compatibility of the deformation gradient  The compatibility condition for the deformation gradient is obtained directly from the above proof by observing that : \\\\boldsymbol{F} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{X}} = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{x} Then the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible \\\\boldsymbol{F} field over a simply connected body are : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{F} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} Compatibility of infinitesimal strains The compatibility problem for small strains can be stated as follows. Given a symmetric second order tensor field \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} when is it possible to construct a vector field \\\\mathbf{u} such that : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\frac{1}{2} [\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{u} + (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{u})^T] Necessary conditions Suppose that there exists \\\\mathbf{u} such that the expression for \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} holds. Now : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} where : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} := \\\\frac{1}{2} [\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{u} - (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{u})^T] Therefore, in index notation, : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\equiv \\\\omega_{ij,k} = \\\\frac{1}{2} (u_{i,jk} - u_{j,ik}) = \\\\frac{1}{2} (u_{i,jk} + u_{k,ji} - u_{j,ik} - u_{k,ji}) = \\\\varepsilon_{ik,j} - \\\\varepsilon_{jk,i} If \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} is continuously differentiable we have \\\\omega_{ij,kl} = \\\\omega_{ij,lk}. Hence, : \\\\varepsilon_{ik,jl} - \\\\varepsilon_{jk,il} - \\\\varepsilon_{il,jk} + \\\\varepsilon_{jl,ik} = 0 In direct tensor notation : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}) = \\\\boldsymbol{0} The above are necessary conditions. If \\\\mathbf{w} is the infinitesimal rotation vector then \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w}+\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w}^T. Hence the necessary condition may also be written as \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times ( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w}+\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w}^T) = \\\\boldsymbol{0}. Sufficient conditions Let us now assume that the condition \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}) = \\\\boldsymbol{0} is satisfied in a portion of a body. Is this condition sufficient to guarantee the existence of a continuous, single-valued displacement field \\\\mathbf{u}? The first step in the process is to show that this condition implies that the infinitesimal rotation tensor \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} is uniquely defined. To do that we integrate \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w} along the path \\\\mathbf{X}_A to \\\\mathbf{X}_B, i.e., : \\\\mathbf{w}(\\\\mathbf{X}_B) - \\\\mathbf{w}(\\\\mathbf{X}_A) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon})\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} Note that we need to know a reference \\\\mathbf{w}(\\\\mathbf{X}_A) to fix the rigid body rotation. The field \\\\mathbf{w}(\\\\mathbf{X}) is uniquely determined only if the contour integral along a closed contour between \\\\mathbf{X}_A and \\\\mathbf{X}_b is zero, i.e., : \\\\oint_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon})\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\boldsymbol{0} But from Stokes' theorem for a simply-connected body and the necessary condition for compatibility : \\\\oint_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} (\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon})\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega_{AB}} \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon})~da = \\\\boldsymbol{0} Therefore, the field \\\\mathbf{w} is uniquely defined which implies that the infinitesimal rotation tensor \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} is also uniquely defined, provided the body is simply connected. In the next step of the process we will consider the uniqueness of the displacement field \\\\mathbf{u}. As before we integrate the displacement gradient : \\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\mathbf{X}_B) - \\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\mathbf{X}_A) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} From Stokes' theorem and using the relations \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\mathbf{w} = -\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\omega we have : \\\\oint_{\\\\mathbf{X}_A}^{\\\\mathbf{X}_B} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega_{AB}} \\\\mathbf{n}\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}+\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})~da = \\\\boldsymbol{0} Hence the displacement field \\\\mathbf{u} is also determined uniquely. Hence the compatibility conditions are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a unique displacement field \\\\mathbf{u} in a simply-connected body. Compatibility for Right Cauchy-Green Deformation field The compatibility problem for the Right Cauchy-Green deformation field can be posed as follows. Problem: Let \\\\boldsymbol{C}(\\\\mathbf{X}) be a positive definite symmetric tensor field defined on the reference configuration. Under what conditions on \\\\boldsymbol{C} does there exist a deformed configuration marked by the position field \\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{X}) such that : (1)\\\\quad\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{X}}\\\\right)^T \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{X}}\\\\right) = \\\\boldsymbol{C} Necessary conditions Suppose that a field \\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{X}) exists that satisfies condition (1). In terms of components with respect to a rectangular Cartesian basis : \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} From finite strain theory we know that C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}. Hence we can write : \\\\delta_{ij}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^j}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} For two symmetric second-order tensor field that are mapped one-to-one we also have the relation : G_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}{\\\\partial x^i}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}{\\\\partial x^j}~g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} From the relation between of G_{ij} and g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} that \\\\delta_{ij} = G_{ij}, we have : _{(x)}\\\\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0 Then, from the relation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 x^m}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha \\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^m}{\\\\partial X^\\\\mu}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^j}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} \\\\,_{(x)}\\\\Gamma^m_{ij} we have : \\\\frac{\\\\partial F^m_{~\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = F^m_{~\\\\mu}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\qquad; ~~ F^i_{~\\\\alpha} := \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha} From finite strain theory we also have : _{(X)}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\gamma}\\\\right) ~;~~ _{(X)}\\\\Gamma^ u_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = g^{ u\\\\gamma} \\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma} ~;~~ g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} ~;~~ g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = C^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} Therefore, : \\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\cfrac{C^{\\\\mu\\\\gamma}}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial C_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial C_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\gamma}\\\\right) and we have : \\\\frac{\\\\partial F^m_{~\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = F^m_{~\\\\mu}~\\\\cfrac{C^{\\\\mu\\\\gamma}}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial C_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial C_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\gamma}\\\\right) Again, using the commutative nature of the order of differentiation, we have : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 F^m_{~\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta \\\\partial X^\\\\rho} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 F^m_{~\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho \\\\partial X^\\\\beta} \\\\implies \\\\frac{\\\\partial F^m_{~\\\\mu}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + F^m_{~\\\\mu}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}] = \\\\frac{\\\\partial F^m_{~\\\\mu}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho} + F^m_{~\\\\mu}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho}] or : F^m_{~\\\\gamma}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\rho}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + F^m_{~\\\\mu}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}] = F^m_{~\\\\gamma}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\beta}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho} + F^m_{~\\\\mu}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho}] After collecting terms we get : F^m_{~\\\\gamma}\\\\left(\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\rho}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}] - \\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\beta}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho}]\\\\right) = 0 From the definition of F^m_{\\\\gamma} we observe that it is invertible and hence cannot be zero. Therefore, : R^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\rho} := \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\rho}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}] - \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta}[\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho}] + \\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\rho}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} - \\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\mu\\\\beta}\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\rho} = 0 We can show these are the mixed components of the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor. Therefore, the necessary conditions for \\\\boldsymbol{C}-compatibility are that the Riemann-Christoffel curvature of the deformation is zero. Sufficient conditions The proof of sufficiency is a bit more involved.Blume, J. A., 1989, \\"Compatibility conditions for a left Cauchy-Green strain field\\", J. Elasticity, v. 21, p. 271-308. We start with the assumption that : R^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\rho} = 0 ~;~~ g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} We have to show that there exist \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{X} such that : \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} From a theorem by T.Y.Thomas Thomas, T. Y., 1934, \\"Systems of total differential equations defined over simply connected domains\\", Annals of Mathematics, 35(4), p. 930-734 we know that the system of equations : \\\\frac{\\\\partial F^i_{~\\\\alpha}}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = F^i_{~\\\\gamma}~\\\\,_{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} has unique solutions F^i_{~\\\\alpha} over simply connected domains if : _{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = _{(X)}\\\\Gamma^\\\\gamma_{\\\\beta\\\\alpha} ~;~~ R^\\\\gamma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\rho} = 0 The first of these is true from the defining of \\\\Gamma^i_{jk} and the second is assumed. Hence the assumed condition gives us a unique F^i_{~\\\\alpha} that is C^2 continuous. Next consider the system of equations : \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha} = F^i_{~\\\\alpha} Since F^i_{~\\\\alpha} is C^2 and the body is simply connected there exists some solution x^i(X^\\\\alpha) to the above equations. We can show that the x^i also satisfy the property that : \\\\det\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}\\\\right e 0 We can also show that the relation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^i}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}~g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^j}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} = \\\\delta^{ij} implies that : g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = C_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^k}{\\\\partial X^\\\\alpha}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^k}{\\\\partial X^\\\\beta} If we associate these quantities with tensor fields we can show that \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{X}} is invertible and the constructed tensor field satisfies the expression for \\\\boldsymbol{C}.

The unit served in Field's, McCausland's, and T. Smith's Brigade. It fought in the Seven Days' Battles and reported 31 killed and 173 wounded. Later it was attached to the Department of Western Virginia and East Tennessee and participated in numerous conflicts including the fight at Piedmont. The 60th took part in Early's operations in the Shenandoah Valley and fought its last battle at Waynesboro. During mid-April, 1865, it disbanded. The field officers were Colonels Beuhring H. Jones and William H. Starke; Lieutenant Colonels James L. Corley, William A. Gilliam, George W. Hammond, J.W. Spaulding, John C. Summers, and W.A. Swank; and Majors William S. Rowan, James W. Sweeney, and Jacob N. Taylor. The last officer to command the unit on the field of battle was Acting Major John L. Caynor who was captured with much of the unit at the Battle of Waynesboro on March 2, 1865.

Its range include much of the eastern United States and Canada, from Ontario to Nova Scotia, and Georgia to Louisiana and eastern Asia in China, Russia, Japan and Korea. The name silvery comes from the fact that the indusia on the underside of the leaf have a silver color when the sori are close to ripening. Description Silvery spleenwort has pinnately divided yellowish green leaves arising from a stout, green, slightly brown hairy and scaly stem. The stem is typically grooved on the upper side, much shorter than the leaf blade and darker colored near its base, being dark red or brown, as the stem reaches the leaflets it becomes a pale green color. The leaves are broadest in the middle with a long pointed tip and tapering base with the lowest pair of leaflets generally pointing downward. The tapering and downward pointed bottom leaves are a diagnostic characteristic for helping to distinguish this fern from similar ferns. The leaves are 30–80 cm long and 10–25 cm in width, their underside is covered in fuzzy yellow-green hairs. There are approximately 18 leaflets on a leaf, these are approximately 15 cm long and 1 cm wide and relatively straight. The leaflets are themselves cut into oblong subleaflets which may have a blunt or rounded tip. The sterile and fertile leaflets are similar in form. The fertile leaves bear sori on the underside of the leaves and are silvery green at first but later become light brown as they ripen. The sori are pinnately arranged on the subleafets in a pattern which follows the veination; they are typically straight or slightly curved with a thick indusia with an entire margin. The fertile pinnae can be described as acrostichoid as the sporangia covers almost the entirety of the underside of the leaf surface. Acrostichoid is also the term from which D. acrostichoides derives its species name. It often forms extensive colonies, growing from creeping roots. Silvery spleenwort is a common fern in stream bottoms, moist woods, and cool shaded areas throughout its range.

Thornton, 61st Virginia Infantry The 61st Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment raised in Virginia for service in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia. The core of what would become the 61st Virginia was organized in Norfolk, Virginia in summer 1861 as the 7th Battalion, Virginia Reserves with eight companies. It served as heavy artillery in the Portsmouth and Norfolk area. However, when these cities were evacuated, the unit was transferred to the infantry and merged into the 61st Regiment being formed in Petersburg, Virginia in October 1862. Lieutenant Colonel Samuel M. Wilson was placed in command. The men of the 61st Virginia were from Portsmouth, and the counties of Norfolk, Isle of Wight, and Greensville. It was assigned to General Mahone's Brigade and which became General Weisinger's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia upon General Mahone's promotion to Division Commander. The 61st participated in many battles from Sharpsburg to Cold Harbor, endured the hardships of the Petersburg trenches south of the James River, and ended the war at Appomattox. It reported 1 wounded at Fredericksburg, had 4 killed and 28 wounded at Chancellorsville, and lost about eight percent of the 356 at Gettysburg. The regiment surrendered 10 officers and 107 men. Its field officers were Colonels Virginius D. Groner and Samuel M. Wilson, Lieutenant Colonels William F. Niemeyer and William H. Stewart, and Major Charles R. McAlpine.

A non- nuclear EMP (NNEMP) device appeared as early as 1965, in the Thunderbirds TV puppet show. By the early 1980s, a number of articles on nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) in the popular press spread knowledge of the EMP phenomenon into the popular culture.Raloff, Janet. May 9, 1981. \\"EMP: A Sleeping Electronic Dragon.\\" Science News. Vol. 119. Page 300Raloff, Janet. May 16, 1981. \\"EMP: Defensive Strategies.\\" Science News. Vol. 119.

Page C1. EMP has been subsequently used in a wide variety of fiction and other aspects of popular culture. Motion picture and electronic entertainment quite often depicts electromagnetic pulse effects incorrectly (though none of these articles address what specifically is incorrect vs correct). This problem has become so bad that it was addressed in a report for Oak Ridge National Laboratory by Metatech Corporation.Report Meta-R-320, Appendix: \\"The Early-Time (E1) High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Its Impact on the U.S. Power Grid\\" January 2010. Written by Metatech Corporation for Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Appendix: E1 HEMP Myths In addition, the United States Air Force Space Command commissioned science educator Bill Nye to make a video for the Air Force called \\"Hollywood vs. EMP\\" so that people who must deal with real EMP would not be confused by motion picture fiction.2009 Telly Award Winners, (Manitou Motion Picture Company, Ltd.) That U.S. Space Command video is not available to the general public. Films *In the 1983 made-for-television motion picture, The Day After, the fictional Soviet nuclear attack on civilian targets begins with a nuclear EMP attack in order to disable as much of the United States' retaliatory capability as possible. This scenario accurately conforms to the Cold War nuclear attack scenarios as understood by military officials and nuclear weapons designers (although post-Cold War scenarios are generally much different). Such a scenario is also presented in the programme Threads, again dealing with a fictional Soviet nuclear attack on Britain.United States House of Representatives. House Armed Services Committee No. 106-31. Hearings held on 7 October 1999. * The 1985 film A View to a Kill starts off with James Bond recovering a Soviet-made microchip, which is discovered to be a copy of an EMP-resistant design produced by Zorin Industries under a US government contract. Subsequent investigation reveals Max Zorin's connections to the KGB, and his plot to destroy American semiconductor production in Silicon Valley by triggering an earthquake. * The 1986 comedy/science-fiction film Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam features a titular \\"gloom beam\\" weapon with effects that mimic that of an electromagnetic pulse (indeed, the beam is powered by a large electromagnet) in that they scramble electronic media. * In 1995's James Bond film GoldenEye, the main plot involves the former Soviet Union developing a pair of satellites called Petya and Misha, carrying an EMP Goldeneye weapon, which are then stolen by the Janus crime syndicate and used against the satellites's original tracking station. Because of the EMP blast, 3 MiGs (which were called in to check a distress signal sent by one of the tracking station's workers) suffer severe damage to their electronic systems. One of them crashes into the station, severely damaging it, and igniting major fires inside. This also disabled British satellites surveillance of the tracking station. * In the 1999 movie The Matrix, one of the surviving humans' few effective weapons against the machines are non-nuclear EMP generators mounted on their hovercraft. In the process, the hovercraft's electronics are also temporarily disabled, as is any advanced machinery around, making it a hazardous last-resort weapon. The EMP is shown disabling machine sentinels near the end of the movie. In the 2003 second sequel The Matrix Revolutions, an EMP is discharged in the dock of the only remaining human city, Zion, disabling many machine sentinels, but also the entire defense system of the city. * In Broken Arrow (1996), the EMP generated by the blast of a nuclear munition deep in an abandoned copper mine knocks out an USAF helicopter which was sent to detect the missing weapons. John Travolta's character in the film accurately predicted the EMP and stopped the jeep in which he was travelling. * In John Carpenter's 1996 film Escape from L.A., Snake Plissken is sent to recover the remote control for an EMP weapon that can be targeted to shut down electrical systems in specific areas. He eventually triggers the weapon to knock out all power around the world. * In the 2001 version of Ocean's Eleven, an explosively pumped flux compression generator (non-nuclear EMP device) in a van is used to shut down the electrical power to Las Vegas. It is not explained how such a small non-nuclear device can shut down the power to an entire large city. It is also not explained how the power could be predictably brought back on line in only 30 seconds after such a disastrous event which should have permanently destroyed all electronics in the area. * In the 2003 film Battle Royale II: Requiem, an EMP was used to deactivate the collars on the students. * In the 2006 film Superman Returns, the use of stolen Kryptonian technology by Lex Luthor causes massive EMP pulses of short duration that cause havoc with the test flight of a shuttle and also damage Metropolis later on in the film. * In the 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, Klaatu destroys the nano swarm, but using EMP which also destroys Earth's technology. * In Cars 2, an EMP causes the cars with alternative fuel called \\"Allinol\\" to explode when affected by the pulse. * In the film The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has a device similar to an EMP weapon. During the motorcycle chase, Batman uses it to disable the motorcycle one of Bane's henchmen is riding. * The 2012 remake of Red Dawn concerns a North Korean invasion of the United States, enabled by an EMP weapon which disables much of the defensive infrastructure of the US. * In the 2013 film Pacific Rim, the kaiju Leatherback fires an EMP that disables the Jaeger Striker Eureka and the Hong Kong Shatterdome's electrical systems. * In the 2014 film Godzilla, the MUTOs have the ability to generate and release EMPs through striking the ground with their forelimbs. * In the 2016 film Independence Day: Resurgence, the aliens disable the pilots' jets and weapons systems with some type of EMP when they initially attack the alien mothership. * The 2016 film Captain America: Civil War featured an EMP device, delivered by Baron Zemo to the substation that provides power for the secret facility holding Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier. * In the 2016 film Amerigeddon, a global terrorist organization aligned with the United Nations uses an EMP attack to disable the United States' power grid. * In the 2017 film The Fate of the Furious, Dominic Toretto along with agent Luke Hobbs retrieves an EMP device from a military outpost in Berlin. * In the 2020 film Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic produces so much energy while running at super-high speeds that he \\"charges up\\" and releases an EMP that knocks out power throughout the entirety of the Pacific Northwest. Literature *A terrorist use of EMP prior to the events of the Eclipse/A Song Called Youth trilogy wiped out most of Wall Street's computer records, causing a major recession. *The 2006 Restoration Series novel Last Light by Terri Blackstock tells about an EMP, possibly generated from the depths of space, disables all electronic and electrical systems worldwide. *Superman stops high atmosphere detonation of a nuclear EMP device in The Dark Knight Returns, the 1986 comic book miniseries written by Frank Miller. *Electromagnetic pulse is a very prominent concept in the novel Warday, published in 1984.Strieber, Whitley and Kunetka, James. (1984) Warday. New York: Warner Books. . Warday is about a limited, but nevertheless devastating, nuclear war that occurs on a single day in October 1988. Warday contains a fictional government report, several pages long, about the fictional Soviet nuclear EMP attack of 28 October 1988 against the United States. The fictional government EMP report is titled \\"Summary of Effects Induced by Electromagnetic Pulse in the October 1988 Attack by the Soviet Union, and their Implications for Recovery\\".Strieber, Whitley and Kunetka, James. (1984) Warday. New York: Warner Books. (first paperback edition) pages 334–340. . The war begins with six high-altitude nuclear EMP detonations over the United States, each with energy yields of 8 to 10 megatons. The six nuclear EMP weapons are detonated in two triangular patterns in order to cover both the eastern and western halves of the continental United States with fairly evenly spaced EMP detonations. *In the 1994 Worldwar series by Harry Turtledove, the reptilian race begin their invasion of Earth during WWII with a barrage of nuclear EMP detonations over industrialized nations, though the EMPs have little effect due to the vacuum tube level technology of early 20th century electronics. *The 2009 novel One Second After and its sequel One Year Later by William R. Forstchen is about a nuclear EMP attack against the United States told from the perspective of a small community in North Carolina. The community is cut off from nearly all outside information by the EMP attack. Large numbers of people die from starvation, lack of medicines, and the lack of medical care. The EMP attacks in One Second After are launched from missiles in container ships. After the book was released, a Russian company started advertising missile launchers hidden inside shipping containers made for launching from such ships.Club-K Container Missile System advertised by Concern Morinformsystem-Agat JSC, with YouTube video *Novels based on the video game Halo describe the use of nuclear EMPs to remove energy shielding on Covenant starships in extreme situations, as the EMP damages human vessels also. EMPs can also be produced by Covenant infantry overcharging plasma pistols. * In The Sum of All Fears by Tom Clancy, an electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear detonation causes several commercial satellites to malfunction, when the EMP causes intense signal interference with nearby media communications equipment relaying with various satellites. * In the novel The 5th Wave and its film adaptation, aliens use an EMP to permanently disable all electrical power on Earth, killing about half a million people worldwide. Television *The Fox show 24 has had EMP weapons featured or mentioned in numerous episodes. *The plot of the 2007 web series Afterworld revolves around a regular EMP pulse that disables all AC electronics, although battery-powered electronic devices still work. *In ABC's Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Season 1 Episode 21 \\"Ragtag\\", Agent Fitz uses an EMP to short out John Garret's circuit, almost killing him. *In the re-imagined miniseries of Battlestar Galactica, a non- nuclear EMP device is used to fake the destruction of the passenger-liner Colonial One by both disabling the incoming missiles and producing an illusion of a nuclear explosion. It is hinted that such devices are standard-issue for Colonial Fleet capital ships, which is unsurprising, given the robotic nature of their Cylon enemies. Unrealistically, everyone on board the liner is knocked out by the pulse. *In Season 2 Episode 1 of Colony, alien invaders use an EMP to disable electronics, motor vehicles, and the power grid prior to landing. *The setting of the Fox television series Dark Angel, produced by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, was in the United States after it has been devastated by a terrorist nuclear EMP attack on 1 June 2009. The setting of the Dark Angel series is in the period of 2019 to 2021, although the United States is still suffering from a deep economic depression caused by the EMP attack a decade earlier. Time periods in the television series are commonly referred to as either pre-pulse or post-pulse. *Falling Skies is a DreamWorks Television series that premiered on Turner Network Television on 19 June 2011. The series was created by Robert Rodat and Steven Spielberg. In the science fiction series, alien invaders arrive and begin silently orbiting the Earth and hovering over major cities, refusing to respond to all attempts at communication. After the invading ships are in place, the aliens suddenly release a large electromagnetic pulse from their orbiting ships, which incapacitates all of the electrical and electronic technology of the advanced countries on the Earth, leaving the inhabitants of the Earth at the mercy of the invaders. *In episode 12 of the 2010 anime series High School of the Dead, in the confusion of a zombie apocalypse, Russia detonates a nuclear warhead over Japan causing an EMP. *In episode number 6 of the 2006–2008 CBS series Jericho, a missile launched by unknown agents from within the United States causes a high-altitude nuclear electromagnetic pulse. The episode was titled 9:02 after the time at which all electric clocks stopped running. *In the 2008 series Knight Rider, the co-protagonist—a Ford Shelby GT500KR named KITT which is capable of driving itself, talking, and firing all sorts of offensive and defensive weapons—has a small EMP device on board. The car is most often seen deploying this weapon to disable vehicles that it pursues. When the EMP is discharged, it is visualized by a distorted blue wave that expands outward from KITT in a circle. The effect is a total electrical shutdown of the target vehicle, which is depicted by the car radio shutting off if in use, the gauge clusters all falling to zero, and the vehicle occupants' cellphones also become inoperable. The target vehicle then (usually) coasts to a stop. In one episode, a continuity error shows up in the fact that after their vehicle has been EMP bombed by KITT, a two-way walkie-talkie held by one of the goons still appears to work. KITT is not affected in any way by his own EMP weapon. *An EMP is used in the 2016 Macgyver season 1 episode \\"Easy Target\\" for use as a threat to demand release of a terrorist leader. *In the 1987 science fiction animated series Spiral Zone episode \\"Back to the Stone Age\\", Overlord and his Black Widows used an EMP device to disable the Zone Riders' advanced weapons. However, the Zone Riders are taught by Australian Aborigines how to fight using \\"primitive\\" weapons and soon defeat the Black Widows. *In Series 9 Episode 1 of the BBC television spy drama Spooks, an EMP device hidden beneath the Houses of Parliament in London is used to disable two explosive-laden submersibles racing down the River Thames. In Series 6 Episode 1 a device described by character Adam Carter as an \\"EMP, HMP maybe\\" (25:26) is used to ambush a convoy transporting a prisoner. *In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Sacrifice of Angels\\", the Dominion use an EM pulse against Benjamin Sisko's fleet, disabling communication between the starships. *In the Stargate SG-1 universe, several instances of EMP were used in both the original series and the spinoff Stargate Atlantis. For example, in the original series episode \\"Urgo\\", it is used in an attempt to neutralize an alien artificial intelligence. In another SG-1 episode, an EMP generator is used, unsuccessfully, in an attempt to destroy an ancient superweapon. In the episode \\"A Matter of Time\\" a directed beam EMP unit was used to close a connection between the SG-1 stargate and one on a planet being pulled into a black hole. In the Stargate Atlantis series, a nuclear EMP was used to destroy an artificial nano-machine virus infecting the city. *The 2014 anime series Terror in Resonance features a nuclear EMP that is detonated from high altitude that knocks out all of Japan's electronics for a year. *In the episode \\"Terror in New York City\\", fourth in the first series of Thunderbirds , Scott Tracy flies Thunderbird 1 over a vehicle containing an illicit video tape of Thunderbird 2 and uses a non-nuclear EMP (NNEMP) device to wipe the tape. *In Transformers Animated, the Autobot medic, Ratchet owned an EMP generator before it was stolen by the Deception bounty hunter Lockdown. Ratchet regained his EMP in the episode \\"The Thrill of the Hunt\\" after infiltrating Lockdown's ship after Lockdown kidnapped Optimus Prime. After a short quarrel, Ratchet pinned Lockdown to the floor via his trophy shelf and forcefully removed Prime's grapplers (which Lockdown cut off of Prime's arms via chainsaw) and his EMP. Ratchet then shot the control panel with the EMP, shutting the ship down, and escaped with Prime as the ship crashed. *In the 2-hour season 1 finale of the 2018 ABC sci-fi drama The Crossing, one of the minor characters constructs a device to generate an EMP in order to destroy all the computers at a secret government detention facility. Video games *In Alien: Isolation, EMP mines appear as one of the craftable items players can use to stun Working Joe Androids upon finding its blueprint. * In Apex Legends the character Crypto can send an EMP from his drone, damaging enemy shields, slowing enemies, and disabling enemy traps. *In Banjo-Tooie, Mumbo Jumbo uses an EMP spell to disrupt a couple machines for the titular duo. * In Battlefield 2142, some weapons used by players utilize EMP that can be used to disable vehicles and equipment, as well as scramble infantry's helmet displays. The support class can use an EMP grenade that can temporarily disable vehicles whereas the engineer class has an EMP mine that works to a greater degree, and the commander can utilize an EMP strike, which is the most powerful EMP weaponry in the game. Anti-air guns have homing EMP missiles which can temporarily disable aircraft. *In Battlefield 4, during a mission in Shanghai, upon exiting the city, an EMP blast occurs darkening the city and causing a nearby helicopter to crash. It is later remarked by some fellow Marines on board a US navy vessel that the blast also disabled some of the ships in the U.S. Naval fleet engaged around the area. Some are still able to function due to operating on diesel fuel and having no spark plug within the engines. *In Battlefield: Bad Company 2, the story focuses on a Russian plot to weaken the United States for invasion by detonating an EMP weapon above the U.S. * In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, an EMP attack is seen in the campaign missions \\"Contingency\\" and \\"Second Sun\\". In \\"Contingency\\", Captain Price, aware of the Rangers' struggle against the Russians in Washington, D.C., uses a submarine to release an ICBM into the higher atmosphere that disables all electronic devices in range. The resulting EMP blast deprives the Russians of their advantage and allows the Americans to recapture Washington D.C. However, the International Space Station is inconveniently unaware of the war on Earth and identifies the missile as an aircraft. As the missile is detonated, releasing an electromagnetic pulse, the shock wave from the nuclear explosion destroys the ISS. Players can obtain an EMP bomb in a multiplayer game (if unlocked and selected for their killstreak reward) after obtaining a 15 kill streak. This is also available in its sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, in the Support Strike Package. When used, all enemy killstreak rewards are disabled, holographic sight, red dot sight, thermal scope and ACOG scope attachments lose their electronic features (such as their targeting reticle) and all aircraft in the airspace are disabled and fall from the sky (including AC-130s and UAVs). However, if the player is using the Assassin Pro perk, the player will be immune to the effects of an EMP. In Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the player can use EMP grenades to disable drones, robotic soldiers, and enemy AST exosuits. * In Command & Conquer: Generals and the expansion pack Zero Hour, the Chinese 5-star General Power is an EMP bomb. Additionally, the U.S. Super weapons General may construct an alternate Patriot missile defense structure that fires warheads that release a localized electromagnetic pulse upon impact, temporarily disabling any manufactured vehicle they touch. In the case of aircraft, those struck with the missiles will be instantly destroyed. * In Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, both factions, Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and Brotherhood of Nod use EMP buildings to temporarily disable mechanical units. In the expansion, \\"Command & Conquer: Firestorm\\", there is a mobile unit with similar capabilities. In Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars Nod can mount EMP generators on their buggies and can reactivate pulse- affected systems using \\"master computer countermeasures\\", whereas Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath features hand-thrown EMP grenades for GDI infantry. Also in Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars the Scrin's Annihilator Tripod and Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath the Reaper-17's Reaper Tripod can both emit a small EMP wave at close range. * In Crysis, the robotic alien enemies have the ability to emanate EMPs that disrupt the player's Nanosuit. In Crysis Warhead, a downed alien robot generates an EMP that shuts down the player's Nanosuit completely. The game features \\"nano-disruptor\\" EMP grenades, purpose- built to be used against Nanosuit-equipped soldiers, though they are very effective against the alien robots as well, disabling them completely. *In Dota 2, EMP is one of Invoker's spells. Its main function is burn away heroes' mana based on his Wex level, which is based on energy. * In Deus Ex, the player can use EMP grenades to disable security systems and robots. * In Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, the GDF can use EMP grenades to disable vehicles and deployables for a short time. The Strogg have scrambler grenades, which work to a similar degree. Both grenades also slightly damage infantry. * In Fallout 3, and followed by Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4, there are also usable EMP grenades that do extra damage to robots.

On the Army Combat Uniform, the tabs are worn above a unit's shoulder patch and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below medals or ribbons on the Army Service Uniform. Tabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because unlike medals - which are only worn on a soldier's garrison or dress uniform - tabs are worn on a soldier's combat uniform. Moreover, tabs are worn above a soldier's shoulder unit insignia patch which rarely include words as a part of their symbolism. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \\"SPECIAL FORCES\\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab). Some tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered special skill badges and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform).

Cohen the eldest child of Moses Cohen was a Vendu-master (Aunctioneer), he \\"lived on Prince Street in Georgetown Parish (District) with Free Peggy [Margaret) McWharter (b. abt. 1745-d. 1806) a Free Person of Color,\\" owned a Blacksmith shop and also served as first United States Postmaster. Abraham Cohen along with his sister Esther Cohen Myers and her husband Mordecai Myers are buried in Beth Elohim Cemetery, which Cohen \\"helped to establish in 1772, twenty-eight years before he was laid to rest there\\". However, the grave marker for younger brother Solomon Cohen (1757-1835) can be found in Chatham County, Georgia at Laurel Grove Cemetery. Solomon Cohen, Jr. (1802-1875), the son of Solomon Cohen, Sr (1757-1835) was the first Portuguese Jew born in Georgetown, South Carolina. He became a lawyer and later moved his widowed mother Bella Moses Cohen and wife Miriam Gratz Moses to Savannah, Georgia circa 1840, around the time of the so-called \\"Organ Controversy,\\" involving the installation of a musical organ and music in Kahal Kodosh Beth Elohim, then an Orthodox place of worship in Charleston. Mordecai Myers the husband of Esther Cohen and brother n' law of Abraham Cohen, arrived in Georgetown (Parish) District about the same time. Abraham Cohen, Solomon Cohen Sr, and Mordecai Myers became prominent Planters in the colonial economy of Indigo, and growing rice, including auctioning and ownership of enslaved Kissi (Geechee) people from West Africa. For years they worshipped at home or the Winyah Indigo Society building.  History  Congregation Beth Elohim in Georgetown, South Carolina's constitution was signed October 30, 1904 and the building opened in 1906. Temple Beth Elohim, in Georgetown, South Carolina as a place of worship was not organized until 1904, more than one hundred years after Abraham Cohen (1739-1800) the Portuguese Jew born in London, England and son of Moses Cohen of Charleston was buried in Beth Elohim cemetery in Georgetown, South Carolina, alongside his sister Esther Cohen Myers and her husband Mordecai Myers. The Temple Beth Elohim building and place of worship located just blocks away from historic Beth Elohim cemetery founded in 1772 by Abraham Cohen and others, the cemetery is directly across from the old Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, built after Emancipation.  Current status  Temple Beth Elohim organized in 1904 is an active Reform congregation with approximately 50 members and weekly Sabbath (Shabbat) services on Friday nights at 7:30 p.m.  References  *New York Public Library. 1897.

The ecoregion includes the islands of Timor, Wetar, Rote, Savu, and adjacent smaller islands. Geography Timor, Wetar, Rote, and Savu are part of the Lesser Sunda Islands. The ecoregion is part of Wallacea, a group of islands that are part of the Australasian realm, but were never joined to either the Australian or Asian continents. The islands of Wallacea are home to a mix of plants and animals from both terrestrial realms, and have many unique species that evolved in isolation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Timor is the largest of the islands at 30,777 km². Timor is politically divided; The independent country of Timor Leste is on the eastern portion of Timor, and western Timor and the other islands are part of Indonesia. Western Timor, Rote, and Savu are part of East Nusa Tenggara province, while Wetar is part of Maluku Province. The islands are mostly mountainous, and Tatamailau on Timor is the highest point at 2986 meters elevation. Wetar reaches 1,407 meters elevation. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical monsoon climate. The islands are in the rain shadow of Australia, and are among the driest in Indonesia. Rainfall is strongly seasonal, and April through November are generally the driest months. The windward southern side of the islands and receive annual rainfall of 2000 mm or more, with a two- to four-month dry season with less than 100 mm per month. The leeward north side of the island is much drier, receiving 1000 mm or less, with nine or more dry months. Some south-facing mountain areas above 900 meters elevation are humid year- round.BirdLife International (2020) Endemic Bird Areas factsheet: Timor and Wetar.

Birdlife International, May 2006. Flora Forest types include lowland evergreen rain forests, montane evergreen rain forests, semi-evergreen rain forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests, and thorn forest/scrub. Evergreen and semi-evergreen rain forests occur in high-rainfall areas on the south side of the island. Deciduous forests and thorn forests are more widespread. Little primary forest remains; most forests are secondary. Extensive burning for shifting cultivation, grazing by goats and other livestock, and tree harvesting has reduced much of the island to anthropogenic grassland and scrub, including many invasive exotic shrubs.Cowie, Ian (2006). \\"A Survey of Flora and Vegetation of the Proposed Jaco– Tutuala–Lore National Park, Timor-Leste (East Timor)\\".

Background Frank Richardson Kent was born in 1877 in Baltimore, Maryland. His uncle was Frank Richardson, also a prominent journalist. Career=1900s-1910s Kent was based in Baltimore, where he started as a cub reporter for the Baltimore Sun in 1898 or 1900. His colleague was H.L. Mencken. In 1902, he wrote state and local politics. In 1910, he spent a year as Washington correspondent. In 1911, he became managing editor of both the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore Evening Sun at the behest of the newspaper's new owner, Charles H. Grasty. 1920s In 1922, he became London correspondent. In 1923, Kent began a daily column on the front page of the Baltimore Sun called \\"The Great Game of Politics,\\" syndicated to 140 papers nationwide (thanks in part of support from Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was one of the big-name journalists who covered the Scopes \\"Monkey Trial\\" in 1925. Kent championed President Herbert Hoover. The Maryland Democratic Party approached Kent to run for office, but he declined in part because he despised methods of campaign financing and cherished his independence. Kent wrote a column on Washington for The New Republic magazine during the administrations of Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. 1930s Although a nominal member of the Democratic Party, by the 1930s he was one of the leading conservative critics of the New Deal programs of the incoming administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945, served 1933-1945), which attempted to fight and counteract the deepening Great Depression since the Wall Street Crash of 1929, at the beginning of the previous Republican Party administration of 31st President Herbert Hoover. Writing from the Washington Bureau of The Sun of Baltimore, Kent espoused his viewpoints with a daily column that beside informing just Baltimoreans and Marylanders but that reached millions of readers in syndicated additional newspapers across the country. Media historians group him with commentators/columnists David Lawrence, Walter Lippmann, Mark Sullivan, and Arthur Krock as influential political commentators in the 1930s.Best, Critical Press and the New Deal pp 13Bernard Sternsher, Rexford Tugwell and the New Deal (1964), pp 88, 244-45Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, Mencken: The American Iconoclast (2005) p. 275. But by 1934 Kent, a lifelong Democrat, turned against the New Deal. He criticized FDR and liberals who tried to disrupt his cherished Jeffersonian principles - the balanced budget, limited spending by the federal government, and a limited government.Emily Bingham and Thomas A. Underwood, The Southern Agrarians and the New Deal: Essays after I'll Take My Stand (2001) p. 125 As his criticism became more severe, he charged that the Democrats no longer stood for states' rights. Kent pronounced the New Deal's AAA farm program a failure and was astonished that the Roosevelt administration did not propose to abandon it, but intended, instead, \\"to proceed from one experiment that has failed to a more drastic experiment along the same line\\" in the direction of greater control over agricultural production. As for the centerpiece of New Deal efforts to promote economic recovery, NRA, Kent found no enthusiasm for it any longer. People no longer looked to see if there was an NRA Blue Eagle in the windows of the stores where they shopped. But the principal objection to the NRA was the growing conviction that the Roosevelt administration had ceased to consider the NRA and AAA as \\"merely temporary devices for the duration of the emergency.\\"Quoted in Best, Critical Press and the New Deal 65-66 Kent rejoiced when the Supreme Court invalidated the National Recovery Act. Desiring Roosevelt's defeat in the 1936 election, Kent was crushed by the election results.Goll, \\"Frank R. Kent's Opposition to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\\" (1968) In 1938, Kent quoted FDR aide Harry Hopkins saying, \\"We are going to spend, spend, spend, tax, tax, tax, elect, elect and elect,\\" leading to the phrase he coined, \\"tax-and-spend Democrat.\\" 1940s In 1947, Kent retired as journalist. On February 27, 1949, Kent wrote on \\"Labor Bill Facts\\" for his \\"Great Game of Politics\\" column. Kent stated that the \\"multitudinous arguments and allegations\\" for and against repeal of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act were too detailed for the \\"average citizen to grasp.\\" However, Kent had four major points that any reader could understand. First, he explained, \\"the real force behind the drive to repeal are the CIO bosses and their publicity agencies,\\" although supported by the AFL, UMW, and Railroad Brotherhood. Second, the CIO's \\"anti-Taft-Harley propaganda\\" vastly outweighed the act's supporters in terms of \\"violence, volume and in cost... Literally, millions of dollars have been spent,\\" more by the CIO than any other group. Third, labor unions care only for themselves, not the general public, while President Truman last year \\"used not only the arguments of Mr. Lee Pressman assailing the Taft-Hartley bill but much of his actual language. Fourth, the Truman administration owes labor so much for his 1948 election that he will sacrifice all others for them. Over the years, Kent's column went from daily to twice-weekly to thrice- weekly and finally to Sunday weekly. 1950s In the 1950s, Kent championed President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard M. Nixon. In January 5, 1958, Kent published the last installment of his column. At the time of his death three months later, he was vice president of A.S. Abell Company, publisher of the Baltimore Sun. Personal life and death Kent married Minnie Whitman, who died in 1910; they had one child, Frank R. Kent Jr. In 1916, he married Elizabeth Thomas. Kent started as a Wilsonian liberal but came out against FDR and his New Deal. Alice Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt and widow of Speaker of the House Nicholas Longworth, was one of Kent's chief sources of both gossip and inside information in Washington. She and Kent held regular social sessions in Washington. Rumor had it that they were lovers. Kent served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known and Society for Science & the Public, from 1923-1927. Kent died age 80 on April 14, 1958, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. At his death, obituaries were read into the Congressional Record from the Baltimore News-Post, Baltimore Evening Sun, Washington Evening Star, Washington Post, Roanoke Times, Pittsburgh Press, and Charleston News & Courier. Legacy=The Great Game of Politics The start of Kent's daily column \\"The Great Game of Politics\\" was of such note that weekly news magazine TIME covered it with its own article. Memorial Lecture The Johns Hopkins University sponsors a Frank R. Kent Memorial Lecture in Journalism. Speakers have included: Russell Baker, Walter Cronkite, Sam Donaldson, David Halberstam, Ted Koppel, Jane Bryant Quinn, James Reston, and Marvin Kalb. Recognition In 1923, TIME magazine wrote, \\"Frank R. Kent, of the Baltimore Sun, has a habit of writing articles for his paper that would be produced in toto in TIME would space and the copyright law permit.\\" After becoming chief of the Washington bureau of the New York Times in 1931, Arthur Krock said that Kent, Richard V. Oulahan (Krock's predecessor at the Times) and J. C. O'Laughlin of the Chicago Tribune were the best and most influential members of the Washington press corps, \\"not only in their coverage of the general news, but in producing news of special depth and authority due to the fact that they had quick access to presidents, Cabinet members and the leaders of Congress.\\" At the time of his death in 1958, the New York Times called him \\"a spear that knew no brother\\" (referring to his disregard for having \\"friends in the Senate\\"). In 1997, the Baltimore Sun said of Kent: > Before \\"Crossfire\\" and \\"The McLaughlin Group,\\" before Germond-Witcover, > before Robert Novak and William Safire, before Sam and George and Cokie and > even before David, before \\"Meet the Press\\" with Tim Russert, even before > \\"Meet the Press\\" with Lawrence Spivak, there was -- Frank R. Kent... who > more or less invented \\"inside-the-Beltway\\" journalism in the 1920s and honed > it into its present-day shape and sharpness in the 1930s. In the 1990s, House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that Frank Kent should serve as the model for Washington journalists because Kent genuinely liked politicians and understood them as human beings. Works Kent's book The Great Game of Politics (1924) was an influential statement that influenced V. O. Key, Jr. and the \\"behavioral school of politics\\". Kent explained the real rules of the game of politics as actually played by politicians.Andrew M. Lucker, V.O.
