In the early 1900s, most were rebuilt with higher pressure boilers and raised fireboxes. Between 1913 and 1918, six were sold to the Commonwealth Railways, entering service on the North Australia Railway as the Ng class.

In 1947, following a bone tuberculosis, he was hospitalized at a sanatorium in Vallauris where he stayed for eight years. During that period he was introduced to photography and started making in 1952 his first experiments in the darkroom, and pictures of Vallauris and its inhabitants. He met Pablo Picasso there in March 1953, who offered him his first camera, a Rolleiflex. Villers produced many portraits of the painter, and their relationship evolved into working together, making hundreds of images based on photographic experiments. In 1962 Heinz Berggruen edited a book, Diurnes (Daytime), based on 30 of these images accompanied by an original text by Jacques Pr√©vert. Since the 1950s, Villers shot many portraits of great artists, among them: Fernand L√©ger, Alexander Calder, Jacques Pr√©vert, Alberto Magnelli, Oliver Mark, Jean Arp, Le Corbusier, Salvador Dal√≠, Joan Mir√≥, Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Jean Cocteau, Bram van Velde, C√©sar Baldaccini, Hans Hartung, Pierre Soulages, Antoni Clav√©, Antoni T√†pies, Francis Ponge, Luis Bu√±uel, Federico Fellini, L√©o Ferr√©, Michel Butor, Ben Vautier, Henri Dutilleux, and Zao Wou Ki. In 1970 he began to experiment with a new way of creating his photography without a camera. He made the negatives himself from pieces of tracing paper. This series was exhibited and a book was released with a text by Michel Butor, Pliages d'Ombres (Folding Shadows). Since then, his personal photographic work was based upon experimentation with shadows and transparencies. He tried to use several emulsion techniques (solarisations, jets of developer). In the mid-1950s Villers began a set of carvings titled Ex-Photos that were exhibited in 1970 at the Loeb Gallery in Paris. In the 1980s he did an important set of paintings on cardboard, The Photographers, exhibited in Paris, Tokyo and New York by the Yoshii Gallery. His friend David Douglas Duncan devoted a book to it entitled A Secret Garden. In the 1980s, Karel Appel made an important set of paintings on photographs of Villers. Later, Robert Combas also worked with him. In 1984 he published his text Photobiographie recounting his life, his artistic process and his relationship with Picasso in a special issue of Les Cahiers du Sud dedicated to him. Since the 2000s, he produced a set of paper cuts works. Significant collections of his photographic work can be found at Nicephorus-Niepce Museum in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne and the Museum of Photography in Charleroi in Belgium. The city of Mougins in the Alpes Maritimes honored Villers with the creation of a Museum of Photography bearing his name. On July 14, 2006, Andr√© Villers became a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. He died on 1 April 2016.

CVM is responsible for malformed calves that are either spontaneously aborted or die shortly after birth. It is caused by a missense mutation in the SLC35A3 gene. Since the mutant form of the gene is recessive, only individuals carrying two copies of the faulty gene (homozygous individuals) are affected. Heterozygous individuals, those who carry one copy of the faulty gene and one copy of the normal gene, have no symptoms but may still pass the disease on to their offspring.  Origin  CVM has been traced back to the bull Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell who lived in the 1980s. He was used for two decades in international Holstein breeding for the exceptional milk production he passed on to his daughters. Unusually, Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell was a carrier for two genetic diseases, CVM and Bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD). The BLAD and CVM genes are located in different chromosomes. When the sire (father) of Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell, a bull named Penstate Ivanhoe Star, was tested he was found to be a carrier of both CVM and BLAD. Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell's grandsire Osborndale Ivanhoe, however, carried only BLAD. Scientists therefore believe that the mutation responsible for CVM occurred either in Penstate Ivanhoe Starissa, or somewhere in his maternal family. The CVM syndrome was first found in a Danish Holstein stock in 1999, and during the following years it was also found in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Japan. Because of the wide international usage of Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell and the large number of animals descending from him, the CVM gene is found in Holstein cattle throughout the world. By the turn of the 21st century, more than 30 percent of the best Holstein sires in both Denmark and Japan were CVM carriers. A test for CVM was developed in the turn of the 21st century, and was first used in Denmark in 2000.  Effects  CVM is caused by a missense mutation in the bovine SLC35A3 gene. The mutant protein has the amino acid phenylalanine at position 180 instead of valine. This causes abnormal nucleotide-sugar transport into the Golgi apparatus, leading to malformations of the vertebral column. CVM is the first genetic disorder found to be caused by defects in the SLC35A3 gene. The mutation responsible for CVM is recessively inherited, and heterozygous carriers of the mutation are asymptomatic. CVM analysis found the bovine SLC35A3 to be the first nucleotide-sugar transportation regulating gene also responsible in the formation of vertebrae and ribs. CVM affects foetal development, being a cause of frequent abortions and stillbirths. Affected calves express low birth weight and a variety of malformations in the vertebrae and heart. Diagnose based on just visual examination of a calf may be difficult due to the wide variety in the expression of anomalies, and a definite diagnosis requires DNA testing.  Abortions  As many as 88 percent of homozygous, CVM-affected foetuses are spontaneously aborted within 260 days from the insemination. A normal bovine pregnancy lasts 280 days. Only 4-5 percent of CVM affected foetuses are calved alive. These calves however are nonviable.  Malformations  Articulation of the bovine metacarpal. A CVM affected calf typically has an abnormally short neck and crooked pasterns. Other malformations associated with CVM are malformations or fusing of vertebrae, scoliosis, contraction and crookedness of distal joints, and abnormal shape of head. Hearts of CVM affected calves have been found to have, among other, abnormal placement of main vessels. Production and breeding CVM is a cause of multiple problems for a cattle keeper. A CVM carrier cow's fertility is 25% lower than normal, and abortions lead to lowered milk production. For these reasons, CVM carriers are often removed. CVM carrier bulls have been pre-eliminated in Europe since the turn of the 21st century. Older bulls were also tested, and some of the best animals were found to be carriers. The removal of this material led to a period of slowing in dairy breeding in a number of European countries.

It did not reach production. Design and development Details of the Temco 58 were first released in January 1956. It was a development of the Model 33 Plebe, which had flown the previous year and competed unsuccessfully for a US Naval trainer contract. The Model 58 seems to have used the same airframe (N848B) but with increased span and length, and was fitted with a more powerful Lycoming engine in place of the Plebe's Continental O-470. The Model 58 was a private venture aimed at overseas air forces, capable of providing both basic and armaments training. Fully aerobatic and equipped for night flying, it was intended to be economical to buy and maintain. It had many interchangeable parts to reduce spares stocks, could have major maintenance in the field and had sixteen access hatches for easy servicing. The Temco 58 was an all-metal, low- cantilever-wing aircraft. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin and rudder were straight edged, with a small fillet.

Election results Results summary  The second election to Broxbourne Borough Council took place on Thursday 6 May 1976. This was an \\"all out\\" election as a result of significant ward boundary changes since the June 1973 election. The warding pattern was now of 14 wards each returning 3 Councillors. This meant that the Council had expanded to 42 elected members - an increase of 2 Councillors. A new ward had been created to cover the Rosedale estate. This warding pattern was to remain in effect until 1999. Following this election Borough Councillors would retire in thirds starting from the 1978 election. The Councillor polling the lowest number of votes in each ward would stand for re-election in 1978. The Councillor who polled the next highest number of votes would stand in 1979 and the Councillor with the highest number of votes would stand in 1980. This arrangement resulted in an electoral curiosity in Rosedale Ward where 2 of the successful candidates at this election polled exactly the same number of votes. To determine who would \\"retire\\" in 1978 after a 2-year term of office, the successful candidates cut a pack of playing cards with the lowest card \\"losing\\" Councillor Robert Donoghue (Conservative) drew a 6 and Councillor Mark Farrington (Labour) drew a 5. Accordingly, Councillor Farrington was determined to have been placed 3rd in the election and stood for re-election in 1978 after a 2-year term of office. The new political balance of the Borough Council was *Conservative 36 seats *Labour 6 seats Shortly after the election Councillor Dan Hickman (Goffs Oak Ward) left the Conservative Group and sat as an Independent Member resulting in a revised political balance of: *Conservative 35 seats *Labour 6 seats *Independent 1 seat Ward resultsReferences *Lea Valley Mercury Friday 14 May 1976 edition *Cheshunt & Waltham Telegraph Friday 14 May 1976 edition 1976 Category:1976 English local elections Category:1970s in Hertfordshire ","title":"1976 Broxbourne Borough Council election"},{"id":"31612999","text":"Gary David Freear (born 4 May 1982) is an English cricketer.

In 1979 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Today it is probably the oldest stone church remaining in Milwaukee. St. James parish was founded in 1850 as a mission of St. Paul's Episcopal Church. In 1851 the congregation bought the land where today's church stands, which had been the site of Kilbourntown's Spring Street Burying Ground - the first cemetery on the west side of what would become Milwaukee. Many of the early settlers were Yankees, and many prominent people were members, with the first Episcopal service held in Increase Lapham's store, and Alexander Mitchell serving on the parish's building committee. In 1867 the congregation built the stone church of today. It was designed by Gordon William Lloyd of Detroit in an English Gothic Revival style. The main block was built first, in 1867‚Äì68, with walls of Wauwautosa limestone, tall lancet openings, and clerestory windows above the side aisles. The square corner tower was added in 1870 to 1871, with corner buttresses and a wheel window that match those on the main block, and a tall broach spire topped with a cross. with A fire on December 31, 1872 destroyed the buildings interior, leaving only the walls and bell tower. The church reopened on April 19, 1874. In 1899 a parish house was added, designed by John Moller. The church is adjacent to the Saint James Court Apartments and across from the Central Library. Both sites are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Over the years, the congregation dwindled until the church closed and the building was sold on November 30, 2017. In 2020 it reopened as a venue for weddings and other events.

The process of selling a script may begin with the pitch, however since the end of the 1980s the ability to pitch a film to producers has greatly depended on the notoriety of the screenwriter. One reason attributed to this effect is that studios are looking for the next big hit, but scared to take a chance on a script that doesn‚Äôt meet a pre-established formula guaranteed to make money since no one knows what will work. The majority of scripts are read by studio interns and others, who give the scripts a ‚Äúconsider‚Äù, ‚Äúpass‚Äù, or ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù status, with most scripts receiving a ‚Äúpass‚Äù rating. However, an agent who's signed the Artists-Managers Agreement drawn up by the Writers Guild of America can submit scripts to producers directly. Agents try to create buzz in the script market using spec script.McDonald, Paul & Wasko, Janet. (2008) ‚ÄúThe Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry‚Äù. Malden,MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 46-48 With everyone in the entertainment industry trying to pursue the million-dollar dream, and Hollywood so desperate for new material ideas, the script market functions and business practices have been pursued in the spec script manner. Studio executives, producers, and agents don't have time to read every script, so readers or script analysts prepare script coverage for them. Spec scripts are written in hopes of being purchased by a producer or studio. A spec script can be passed around by an agent, which can create a bidding war. The spec script process is considered by some to be problematic, because the bidding process can attract inflated prices from the boosting of mediocre scripts.

The Montrose Placer Mining Company built the flume in the 1880s to facilitate gold mining. Some sections of the flume remain attached to the canyon wall, although much of the wood has vanished. Background The Montrose Placer Mining Company was formed to mine gold from placer deposits along the Dolores River. Hydraulic mining, a popular method of exploiting placer deposits, required water to be efficiently transported, often using wooden flumes to maintain the necessary volume and pressure. Cliffside flumes were developed in California, using trestles and brackets (called bents) at regular intervals to support the flume box. The flume connected with a six mile long ditch, both designed to provide water for miners in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. Construction Construction of the Hanging Flume took three years, beginning in 1887. Approximately 24 workers participated in the build, suspended from ropes onto the cliff face. A derrick may also have been used. The construction used 1.8 million board feet of lumber and ended up with a total cost over $100,000. The timber used was mostly Ponderosa pine, a local tree, and it was supported using iron rods. The completed flume was approximately long and up to above the river. It began on a dam on the San Miguel River above Uravan, Colorado. The flume's opening (the headgate) no longer exists, and the connecting ditch has been filled. The actual wooden flume was 6 feet wide and 4 feet deep. When in use, it conveyed 80,000,000 gallons of water each day. The flume was only used for three years before being abandoned. The reason was that the mine itself was closed after the discovery that most of the gold was unrecoverable, and the investors in the project only made $80,000 after investing over $1,000,000 into the mine and associated engineering works. After the closure of the mine, local residents reused the timber. Research and conservation Close up view of the flume, showing the rods that supported the wood. The Hanging Flume is in poor condition: it has been vandalized in places, some of its wood has been removed, and what remains has deteriorated, particularly where directly exposed to weather. The pine wood is vulnerable to decay and fungi. In April 2004, structural engineers rappelled down to the structure at seven locations to measure and evaluate it. They examined the design of the structure, particularly the bents, of which they identified five distinct types. This preliminary analysis is being used to consider a reconstruction of the flume incorporating the remaining structural elements.

Biography  He was born in Dublin, the son of Robert Fitzsimon and his wife Janet Cusack. He had close links to the Anglo- Irish nobility through his sister Alison, who married as his third wife Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth; after Lord Howth's death Alison remarried into the influential Plunkett family. Fitzsimon was precentor of St Patrick's Cathedral in 1476, and consecrated Archbishop of Dublin in 1484. He was Lord Deputy of Ireland 1492‚Äì94 and Lord Chancellor of Ireland 1496‚Äì98. He died at Finglas in 1511.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926  Career  Like most of the Anglo-Irish nobility (except his brother-in-law, Lord Howth) he made the mistake of supporting the claim of the pretender Lambert Simnel to the English throne, and was present at his coronation in Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. After the crushing of Simnel's cause at the Battle of Stoke Fitzsimon was pardoned and played a prominent part in the ceremony by which the Irish nobles expiated their treason. Soon afterwards he quarreled with the Earl of Kildare, the dominant figure in Irish politics, and the moving force behind the Simnel rebellion, and with Kildare's father-in-law, Lord Portlester. Thereafter the Archbishop was considered a reliable supporter of the Tudor dynasty. It may well have been his influence which prevented a later pretender, Perkin Warbeck, from gaining significant support in Ireland. Lambert Simnel in Ireland Lord Deputy In 1492 he became Lord Deputy of Ireland Chrimes S.B. Henry VII Yale University Press 1999 and convened a Parliament at Dublin which was largely devoted to annulling measures previously taken against him by his main political rival, Baron Portlester. He saw himself as a social reformer, and persuaded the King to take stern action against beggars: he argued that most of them were perfectly well able to work but preferred to live on charity. The King agreed, and orders were accordingly issued that no one be permitted to beg without a certificate from the appropriate local authority. Further, a workhouse was to be built in every parish for vagabonds to work in.D'Alton, John Memoirs of the Archbishops of Dublin Dublin Hodges and Smith 1838 At the same time he urged that the younger sons of the nobility should be encouraged to learn a useful trade rather than live off their parents.D'Alton Archbishops of Dublin Lord Chancellor He was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1496‚Äì98; there is some doubt as to whether he resumed the office at a later date. O'Flanagan states that he was a diligent Chancellor, but this did not lead him to neglect his duties as Archbishop.O'Flanagan J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 He held a synod in Dublin in 1494 and in 1497 granted the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral licence to build a hospital at Kevin Street for the poor people of Dublin, who must however be able to satisfy the Dean that they were good Catholics of blameless life and of English origin. He made some efforts to revive the almost moribund Medieval University of Dublin (not to be confused with Trinity College, Dublin), by imposing a levy on the clergy to provide salaries for the lecturers. In his later years he spent much of his time at the English Court, and despite his previous support for Lambert Simnel he seems to have enjoyed the trust of King Henry VII. O'Flanagan tells the story that the King asked Fitzsimon what he thought of a recent sermon preached by one of the Royal chaplains: the Archbishop said frankly that it was unduly flattering of the King. The King, highly amused, replied that this was his opinion also.Lives of the Lord Chancellors  Character  Ball describes him as a man of remarkable strength of mind and body and one of the most learned men of his time.The Judges in Ireland O'Flanagan calls him a man of great gravity and learning.Lives of the Lord Chancellors See also * Symon Semeonis  References  Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1511 deaths Category:15th-century Irish people Category:16th-century Irish people Category:Pre-Reformation bishops in Ireland Category:Archbishops of Dublin Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland ","title":"Walter Fitzsimon"},{"id":"31613148","text":"Olympic Club, commonly known as Olympic, or as Olympic de Barbacena is a Brazilian football club based in Barbacena, Minas Gerais state.

He was an officer of the Imperial German Navy who in 1901 became head of the British section of the German Admiralty's intelligence service, the Nachrichten-Abteilung, 'N'. He had trained at the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Chicago and spoke fluent English with an American accent. Steinhauer had been part of Kaiser Wilhelm II's bodyguard at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. During the visit Steinhauer foiled an assassination attempt by a group of Russian anarchists on the Kaiser's life, working alongside British detective and spymaster William Melville. Steinhauer was responsible for the creation of a network of German spies in Britain in the period before the war. Steinhauer had mostly recruited his agents through writing to German businessmen resident in the UK inviting them to work for him. MI5 soon clocked onto this activity and began intercepting the correspondence between Steinhauer and his agents, between 1911 and 1914 MI5 intercepted 1,189 letters relating to such German espionage. In late July, the week before the declaration of the First World War, Steinhauer toured Britain under the alias 'Fritsches' to make contact with elements of his agent network, although Mi5 knew he was present in the country they did not have the resources to mount sufficient surveillance to apprehend him. Vernon Kell, head of MI5, claimed to have ordered the arrest of 22 of Steinhauer's agent ring at the outset of war, leaving no significant German spies in Great Britain; but modern research has exploded this claim, which appears to have been made to promote the hasty passage of the Aliens Restriction Act of August 1914. Steinhauer later recalled the Kaiser's fury at the seeming obliteration of German surveillance of the British Navy screaming 'Am I surrounded by dolts? Who is responsible? Why was I not told!?' Trivia Historian Andrew Cook has suggested that Steinhauer's plot to blow up the Bank of England could have been Ian Fleming's inspiration for the character and plot of Auric Goldfinger.

The farm was first homesteaded in 1871 by Elof and Eva Modig, who emigrated from Sweden. The couple raised five children and grew wheat on their farm, as was common in the 1870s. By the 1890s Minnesota farming had begun to diversify, with cheese and butter production becoming popular and distributed by cooperative creameries. In 1915 Charles Moody, one of the sons, decided to build a modern round barn. The barn is in diameter and about the same in height. The interior contains a silo. The first floor of the barn housed milk cows and their calves, while the second floor was used to store hay. Instead of the traditional red and white paint, the Moody barn was painted in a blue-gray color. The construction cost was $3200, with seven men paid $1 per day plus meals for the construction. The accompanying farm house was moved from the west side of the road to the east side in 2004. The barn and farm house are now owned by the Chisago Lakes Township and managed by the Chisago County Historical Society. The barn has been repainted and reshingled, and is situated in the Moody Lake Park. The barn is the last remaining round barn in Chisago County.

History IFYC officially launched its operations at the 1999 Parliament of the World‚Äôs Religions in Cape Town, South Africa, under the direction of Patel and organizers Anastasia White and Jeff Pinzino. At the time, Patel was finishing up his doctorate in the sociology of religion at Oxford University, so Pinzino spearheaded much of IFYC‚Äôs early organizational growth. Upon completing his doctorate in 2002, Patel took over as executive director. A $35,000 grant from the Ford Foundation enabled IFYC to run its first conference of interfaith leaders and teach a graduate-level course on the methodology of interfaith work. Since then, the organization has coordinated the Chicago Youth Council, a group of eight student interfaith leaders, Days of Interfaith Youth Service, and the Fellows Alliance, a year-long fellowship that trained student interfaith leaders on individual campuses. Patel discuses the genesis of IFYC in-depth in his memoir, Acts of Faith Today the organization reaches college students through its Interfaith Leadership Institutes (ILIs) and the Better Together Campaign. Mission and Methodology IFYC identifies a divisive public conversation about religion as a major problem facing America today. The organization seeks to promote a different narrative that instead emphasizes cooperation among different religious and secular communities. IFYC works to foster what it calls a \\"critical mass\\" of interfaith leaders on college campuses that will later craft and drive this dialogue of interfaith cooperation. Based on the work of Diana Eck‚Äôs Pluralism Project, IFYC identifies three core components of interfaith cooperation: respect for religious identity, mutually inspiring relationships, and common action for the common good. In the first component, individuals create a space where each feels comfortable sharing his or her faith identity, and engaging with others‚Äô religious perspectives. Such a space enables individuals to identify values shared by many religious and secular traditions, such as justice, mercy and compassion. By establishing appreciative relationships, IFYC‚Äôs methodology encourages individuals to collaborate across faith traditions on service projects that speak to these commonly held values. Programs Better Together and Interfaith Leadership Institutes (ILIs) The Better Together Campaign is IFYC‚Äôs model for an interfaith action campaign on college campuses nationally. The campaign is designed to function in a variety of campus environments while allowing students to adapt it to their own community. Under the current campaign model, students begin by deciding upon an important social issue in their community (hunger, poverty, public health, etc.) around which to focus interfaith service work. The model then offers students several events they may choose to run on campus: * Talk Better Together, in which participants have short, rapid-fire conversations about personal beliefs; * Watch Better Together, which utilizes film to spark discussion about a social issue; * Play Better Together, which gathers students together around a game; * Fast Better Together, in which students fast alongside each other; and * Do Better Together, which puts students to work on a service project that relates to a social issue. While any group of students may run the campaign, IFYC staff communicate the campaign‚Äôs ideas and methods at four day-long ILIs. IFYC partnered with the White House to hold its first ILIs at Georgetown University in October 2010.\\"White House Hosts the Interfaith Leadership Institute.\\" Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.

It filed for bankruptcy in 2016. It was funded by a grant through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the federal stimulus bill, in an effort to provide high-speed Internet access to 15 Florida counties. History FRBA was first created in March 2010 by two nonprofit economic development corporations: Florida's Heartland Regional Economic Development Initiative, or REDI, in south central Florida, and Opportunity Florida in northwest Florida. FRBA encompasses 15 Florida counties and communities -- Holmes, Washington, Jackson, Gadsden, Calhoun, Liberty, Gulf, Franklin, Hardee, DeSoto, Highlands, Okeechobee, Glades, and Hendry counties as well as the community of Immokalee. The initial goal was to win a federal grant under the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and deploy a middle mile broadband transport network in underserved rural areas of Florida. FRBA applied for a $24 million grant through the program in mid-2010, winning the grant later that year. Rural Area of Critical Economic Concern The two FRBA geographic areas are known as Rural Areas of Critical Economic Concern through Florida's Rural Economic Development Initiative, or REDI. Rural counties qualify for REDI with populations of less than 100,000 and exhibit low per capita income, low per capital taxable values, high unemployment or underemployment, and other poor economic factors. The designation is provided by the Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development, and are re-evaluated each year for REDI eligibility. Middle Mile Project When completed, the FRBA broadband project will deliver up to 1 Gbps capacity throughout the region, more than 1,000 times the current capacity available to public and private entities in the region. The system is being designed using microwave links, sending data wirelessly from one focused point to the next using existing cellular towers. This network, when commercial Internet service providers connect with it, will provide broadband Internet to more than 174,000 households and 16,400 businesses.

An international co-production, it was an adaptation of Nicolas Born's novel of the same name, which had appeared in 1979. The film follows a German journalist sent to Beirut to report on the Lebanese Civil War, which had begun in 1975. Cast *Bruno Ganz as Georg Laschen *Hanna Schygulla as Ariane Nassar *Jerzy Skolimowski as Hoffmann *Jean Carmet as Rudnik *Gila von Weitershausen as Greta Laschen *Khaled El Sayed as Progressive Officer (uncredited) Story Journalist Georg Laschen (Bruno Ganz) is sent to Beirut, where he is supposed to report on the local civil war. His feelings about this mission are influenced by the fact that his marriage to his wife Greta (Gila von Weitershausen) back home is dysfunctional, and the conflict in Lebanon remains incomprehensible to him. He feels that his comments and his own problems to understand the situation don't really count because violence sells anyway. Subsequently he feels that his reports aren't real journalism and by pretending to be that they can downright be considered deceit (or in German: F√§lschung). After a fling with a local lady named Arianna (Hanna Schygulla) he happens to kill a man. He realises how relatively easily one's moral standards can be corrupted in a violent environment and how hard or even impossible it is to remain unbiased as a journalist. Production The film was shot on location in Beirut. The Lebanese Civil War, which began in 1975, would continue until 1990. The New York Times remarked that it was \\"filmed in 1980 under remarkable conditions: with its crew confined to \\"safe\\" portions of Beirut while the fighting went on elsewhere, but with ubiquitous evidence of real warfare everywhere.\\"Janet Maslin, The New York Times, 11 February 1982, Circle of Deceit (1981): 'CIRCLE OF DECEIT,' WAR CORRESPONDENT IN BEIRUT Reception The New York Times described it as \\"a balanced, thoughtful, extremely moving vision of wartime tragedy.\\" Awards The film was nominated for the C√©sar Award for Best Foreign Film in 1981. Jerzy Skolimowski won the Best Supporting Actor Deutscher Filmpreis in 1982, for his role as the war photographer Hoffmann.

The Germans executed the operation Tanne Ost trying to occupy Hogland from the Finnish armed forces and defend the Estonian coast from the Soviet Baltic Navy on the Eastern isles of the Baltic Sea. The Finns, on their behalf, at the request of the Allied controlling committee, attacked the Germans in Pudasj√§rvi on 28 September 1944, which was the end of the phoney war and the beginning of the real War of Lapland. It and the whole World War II in Finland ended on 27 April 1945, when the very last German troops had left Finland and crossed the border to the German-occupied Norway in the municipality of Enonteki√∂ and the Finnish Defence Forces achieved the Three-Country Cairn of Finland, Norway and Sweden.

Adeseun noted a wide discrepancy between claims of implementation rate between the legislature and the executive. Speaking in March 2011, Adeseun said that the Appropriation Bill 2011 had been passed out of the national interest, citing intense pressure from the Executive, despite the initial refusal by the House since some agencies had failed to present their budgets.

Artists covering \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" include the Goo Goo Dolls. The song was also featured in an episode of Glee. Background Nicks wrote \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" much earlier than the Rumours sessions, when she and Lindsey Buckingham were performing as the duo Buckingham Nicks, prior to joining Fleetwood Mac. The other members of Fleetwood Mac decided to use the song as a replacement for a song Nicks had written for Rumours, \\"Silver Springs,\\" when they found that \\"Silver Springs\\" would not fit on the album. The other four band members made a recording of the song without Nicks late in the Rumours recording sessions. Buckingham was able to sing Nicks' lead vocal on this version as well as the harmony vocals because he knew the song from their Buckingham Nicks days. Drummer Mick Fleetwood then broke the news to Nicks that they decided that they needed to replace \\"Silver Springs\\" with \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" and wanted her to re-record her vocal part over the one Buckingham recorded for the song. At first, Nicks was very angry and did not want to cooperate with the recording, but ultimately she relented, unhappy with the prospect of only having two songwriting credits on the album. Nicks later remarked that if \\"Silver Springs\\" had to be replaced, she was glad that \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" was used, since she likes the recording, noting the Everly Brothers-like harmonies in her vocals with Buckingham. In 1978, the song was also released as a single in Japan with \\"Oh Daddy\\". In 2013, the song was used in a Saturday Night Live sketch, \\"Diner Divorce\\". The divorcing couple's intense arguments would end whenever the song played. Lyrics and music \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" has a country music flavor. It is an uptempo song, which recording engineer Ken Caillat describes as \\"3:16 of high impact energy.\\" Fleetwood Mac biographer Cath Carrolll describes the opening of the song as being \\"unprepossessing\\" and \\"almost lumpen.\\" However, she claims this has a purpose, as it makes it even more powerful and energetic when the main part of the song kicks in. The lyrics provide a conciliatory view of the end of a romantic relationship. Although the song was written long before the breakup of Nicks' relationship with Fleetwood Mac bandmate Lindsey Buckingham, \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" fits the pattern of the songs of Rumours where Nicks' songs, such as \\"Dreams\\" provided a conciliatory perspective and Buckingham's songs, such as \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and \\"Second Hand News,\\" were more bitter. One of the lines of the song seems to be in answer to a line in a song Buckingham wrote for the previous self-titled Fleetwood Mac album. On \\"Monday Morning\\", Buckingham sang the lines In \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" Nicks picks up the \\"move down the line\\" motif with the lines: Reception Rolling Stone critic John Swenson described \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" as \\"pure post-Buffalo Springfield country- rock formula.\\" Carroll attributes its strength to the vocal harmonies between Nicks and Buckingham and to Buckingham's \\"strong country-pop guitar solo.\\" Stylus Magazine critic Patrick McKay regards \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" as one of the \\"strongest tracks\\" on Rumours. In his book Killing Yourself to Live: 85% of a True Story, Chuck Klosterman praised Buckingham's acoustic guitar playing in that the way you can hear the squeaking sound of his fingers sliding down the guitar strings made the opening of the song sound \\"organic and raw.\\" Music historian Joel Whitburn lists \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" as an essential song for downloading to an iPod. Author Joe S. Harrington regards Liz Phair's \\"Six Foot One\\" as a \\"musical [and] spiritual descendent\\" of \\"I Don't Want to Know.\\" The Goo Goo Dolls covered \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" on Legacy - A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours in 1998. According to AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Goo Goo Dolls rock the song up. The song was used in an episode of Glee entitled \\"Rumours.\\" The song was performed by Cory Monteith (as Finn Hudson) and Dianna Agron (as Quinn Fabray).

It reads \\"Use Getz cockroach and bed bug exterminators, sold by all druggists.\\" Bed bugs, or Cimicidae, are small parasitic insects. The term usually refers to species that prefer to feed on human blood. Early detection and treatment are critical to successful control. According to a survey, the most commonly infested places are the mattress (98.2%), boxspring (93.6%), as well as nearby carpets and baseboards (94.1%).Gangloff-Kaufmann, J.C. et al. 2006 Bed bugs in America: a pest management industry survey. Am. Entomol. 52: 105‚Äì106 In fact, bed bugs thrive in areas where there is an adequate supply of available hosts, and plenty of cracks and harborages within of the host.Harlan H. J. 2006 Bed bugs 101: the basics of Cimex lectularius. Am. Entomol. 52: 99‚Äì101 Because treatments are required in sleeping areas and other sensitive locations, methods other than chemical pesticides are in demand. Treatments can be costly, laborious, time consuming, repetitive, and embarrassing, and may entail health risks. Public health laws Bed bug infestations spread easily in connecting units and have negative effects on psychological well-being and housing markets. In response, many areas have specific laws about responsibilities upon discovering a bed bug infestation, particularly in hotels and multi-family housing units, because an unprofessional level of response can have the effect of prolonging the invisible part of the infestation and spreading it to nearby units. Common laws include responsibilities such as the following: Lessors must educate all lessees about bedbugs, lessee must immediately notify lessor in writing upon discovery of infestation, lessor must not intentionally lease infested unit, lessee must not intentionally introduce infested items, lessor must eradicate the infestation immediately every time it occurs at a professional level including all connecting units, and lessee must cooperate in the eradication process. In a 2015 survey, reports of bed bug infestation in social media lowered the value of a hotel room to $38 for business travelers and $23 for leisure travelers. Mapped bed bug reports graphically illustrate how difficult it can be to eliminate bed bugs in densely populated areas where many people live in adjacent units like in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Pesticides Though commonly used, the pesticide approach often requires multiple visits and may not always be effective due to pesticide resistance and dispersal of the bed bugs. According to a 2005 survey, only 6.1% of companies claim to be able to eliminate bed bugs in a single visit, while 62.6% claim to be able to control a problem in 2‚Äì3 visits. Insecticide application may cause dispersal of bed bugs to neighbouring areas of a structure, spreading the infestation. Furthermore, the problem of insecticide resistance in bed bug populations increases their opportunity to spread. Studies of bed bug populations across the United States indicate that resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which are used in the majority of bed bugs cases, is widespread.Romero A. et al. 2007. Insecticide resistance in the bed bug: a factor in the pest's sudden resurgence? J. Med. Ent. Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 175 ‚Äì 178 Exterminators often require individuals to dispose of furniture and other infested materials because the pesticides are ineffective. It is advisable to break or mark these infested items to prevent their being unintentionally recycled and furthering the spread of bed bugs. Effectiveness The well-established resistance of bed bugs to DDT and pyrethroids has created a need for different and newer chemical approaches to the extermination of bed bugs. In 2008 a study was conducted on bed bug resistance to a variety of both old and new insecticides, with the following results, listed in order from most- to least-effective: Œª-cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, carbaryl, imidacloprid, fipronil, permethrin, diazinon, spinosyn, dichlorvos, chlorfenapyr, and DDT. Note that the first of these, Œª-cyhalothrin, is itself a pyrethroid-based insecticide‚Äî in the past it has been used principally for the treatment of cotton crops and so bed bugs have not yet developed a genetic resistance to it. Up until the 1990s chlorpyrifos was used as an agent with longterm effect, but the EC biocide declaration 98/8https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31998L0008 prohibited the use from August 2008 onward.Declaration of German manufacturer Frowein GMBH & Co.

Bedbugs prefer to hide in and around the bed frame but it can still be a good idea to put a tight cotton cover on mattress and bedding to prevent access. Pesticide resistance Bed bugs are largely resistant to various pesticides including DDT and organophosphates. Most populations have developed a resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. Although now often ineffective, the resistance to pyrethroid allows for new chemicals that work in different ways to be investigated, so chemical management can continue to be one part in the resolving of bed bug infestations.Insecticide Resistance in the Bed Bug: A Factor in the Pest‚Äôs Sudden Resurgence? Alvaro Romero, Michael F. Potter, Daniel A. Potter, Kenneth F. Haynes Journal of Medical Entomology 2007 44 (2), 175‚Äì178 There is growing interest in both synthetic pyrethroid and the pyrrole insecticide, chlorfenapyr. Insect growth regulators, such as hydroprene (Gentrol), are also sometimes used. Populations in Arkansas have been found to be highly resistant to DDT, with an LD50 of more than 100,000 ppm. DDT was seen to make bed bugs more active in studies conducted in Africa. Bed bug pesticide-resistance appears to be increasing dramatically. Bed bug populations sampled across the U.S. showed a tolerance for pyrethroids several thousand times greater than laboratory bed bugs.Voiland, Adam. \\"You May not be Alone\\" U.S. News & World Report 16 July 2007, Vol. 143, Issue 2, p53‚Äì54. New York City bed bugs have been found to be 264 times more resistant to deltamethrin than Florida bed bugs due to mutations and evolution.\\"Biochemical and Molecular Analysis of Deltamethrin Resistance in the Common Bed Bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae)\\" Journal of Medical Entomology,45 (6), 2008, pp. 1092‚Äì1101 Products developed in the mid 2010s combine neonicotinoids with pyrethroids, but according to a January 2016 survey published by the Journal of Medical Entomology, bed bug resistance in two major US cities now includes neonicotinoids. A population genetics study of bed bugs in the United States, Canada, and Australia using a mitochondrial DNA marker found high levels of genetic variation. This suggests the studied bed bug populations did not undergo a genetic bottleneck as one would expect from insecticide control during the 1940s and 1950s, but instead, that populations may have been maintained on other hosts such as birds and bats. In contrast to the high amount of genetic variation observed with the mitochondrial DNA marker, no genetic variation in a nuclear RNA marker was observed. This suggests increased gene flow of previously isolated bed bug populations, and given the absence of barriers to gene flow, the spread of insecticide resistance may be rapid. Physical isolation Isolation of humans is attempted with numerous devices and methods including zippered bed bug-proof mattress covers, bed-leg moat devices, double sided tape, and other barriers. However, even with isolated beds, bed bug infestations persist if the bed itself is not free of bed bugs, or if it is re-infested, which could happen quite easily. It is convenient to place medium-sized belongings in sealed transparent plastic bags (such as plastic bags for freezing; larger models exist as well). Once closed, the tightness should be verified by pressing the bag and ensuring that air doesn't exit. It is as well convenient to mark these sealed bags as 'contaminated'/'decontaminated'. Inorganic materials A sample of food- grade diatomaceous earth Inorganic materials such as diatomaceous earth or amorphous silica gel may be used in conjunction with other methods to manage a bed bug infestation, provided they are used in a dry environment. Upon contact with such dust-like materials, the waxy outer layer of the insect's exoskeleton is disrupted, which causes them to dehydrate.Insects in the City, Texas A&M; Food-grade diatomaceous earth has been widely used to combat infestations. However, it can take weeks to have a significant effect. Studies examined and compared diatomaceous earth and synthetically produced, pure amorphous (i.e. non-crystalline) silica, so-called silica gel. They investigated the use of these substances as a stand-alone treatment in real- life scenarios, and compared them to usual poisonous agents. They found that the effect of diatomaceous earth was surprisingly low when used in real-life scenarios, while the synthetic product was extremely effective and fast in killing bed bugs in such settings. Silica gel was also more effective than usual poisonous pesticides (particularly in cases with pesticide resistant bugs). When applied after being mixed with water and then sprayed, the outcome for silica gel was significantly lower, but still distinctly better than for the natural silica (used dry). Authors argued that the reason for the poor outcome for diatomaceous earth as a stand-alone treatment was multi-factorial. When tested in laboratory where the bed bugs had intensive, prolonged contact with diatomaceous earth and no access to a host, diatomaceous earth performed very well. Silica gel, on the other side, performed in vitro consistently well even if applied to bed bugs in extremely low doses and with very slight and short (often only seconds or few minutes) contact to the substance. Although occasionally applied as a safe indoor pesticide treatment for other insects, boric acid is ineffectual against bed bugs because bed bugs do not groom. Organic materials=Bean leaves A traditional Balkan method of trapping bed bugs is to spread bean leaves in infested areas. The trichomes (microscopic hooked hairs) on the leaves trap the bugs by piercing the tarsi joints of the bed bug's arthropod legs. As a bug struggles to get free, it impales itself further on the bean leaf's trichomes. The bed bugs and leaves then can be collected and destroyed. Researchers are examining ways to reproduce this capability with artificial materials. Essential oils Many claims have been made about essential oils killing bed bugs. However, they are unproven. The FTC is now filing a suit against companies making these claims about these oils, specifically about cedar, cinnamon, lemongrass, peppermint, and clove oils. Contaminated belongings Disposal of items from the contaminated area can reduce the population of bed bugs and unhatched eggs. Removal of items such as mattresses, box springs, couches etc. is costly and usually insufficient to eradicate infestation because of eggs and adults hiding in surrounding areas. If the entire infestation is not eliminated prior to bringing new or cleaned personal and household items back into a home, these items will likely become infested and require additional treatment. Treating clothing, shoes, linens, and other household items within the affected environment is difficult and frequently ineffective because of the difficulty of keeping cleaned items quarantined from infestation. Many bed bug exterminating specialists recommend removing personal and household items from the infested structure. Many metropolitan areas offer more effective treatments such as high-heat dryers and dry cleaning with PERC with the added benefit of the treated items remaining stored until the affected home's bed bug infestation is eradicated. The improper disposal of infested furniture also facilitates the spread of bed bugs. Marking the discarded items as infested can help prevent infesting new areas. Bed bugs can go without feeding for 20 to 400 days, depending on temperature and humidity. Older stages of nymphs can survive longer without feeding than younger ones, and adults have survived without food for more than 400 days in the laboratory at low temperatures. Adults may live up to one year or more, and there can be up to four successive generations per year. Vacuuming Vacuuming helps with reducing bed bug infestations, but does not eliminate bed bugs hidden inside of materials. Also, unless the contents of the vacuum are emptied immediately after each use, bedbugs may crawl out through the vacuum's hoses and re- establish themselves. Vacuuming with a large bristle attachment can also aid in removing hidden bugs as well. Heat treatment=Steam Steam treatment can effectively kill all stages of bed bugs. To be effective, steam treatment must reach 150‚Äì170 degrees Fahrenheit (65 - 75 ¬∞C) for a sustained period. Unfortunately, bed bugs hide in a diversity of places, making steam treatment very tedious, labour-intensive and time consuming. There is also the risk of the steam not penetrating materials enough to kill hidden bed bugs. The steam may also damage materials such as varnished wood, or cause mold from the moisture left behind. Effective treatment requires repeated and very thorough steaming of the mattress, box spring, bed frame, bed covers, pillows, not to mention other materials and objects within the infested room, such as carpets and curtains. Infested clothes can be effectively treated by a high- temperature ironing with vapor. If performed meticulously, this method yields faster disinfection compared to high-temperature washing in a washing machine. However, attention should be paid in order to avoid bedbug escape from the ironed clothes. For volumetric objects (e.g. pillow, blanket, sleeping bag, rug), boiling in a large saucepan for more than 10 minutes represents a reliable method. In this manner, the lethal temperatures propagate with certainty deep inside the object, which is not necessarily the case of a washing machine cleaning cycle. For smaller objects, pouring boiling water from a kettle onto the object located in a basin may be enough to kill bed bugs and eggs.  Clothes dryers  Clothes dryers can be used for killing bed bugs in clothing and blankets. Infested clothes and bedding are first washed in hot water with laundry detergent then placed in the dryer, and then after the items are completely dry, continue drying for at least 20 minutes longer at high heat.Armed Forces Pest Management Board. 2006. Bed bugs ‚Äì importance, biology, and control strategies. Washington, D.C.: Armed Forces Pest Management Board Technical Guide No. 44. However, this does not eliminate bed bugs in the mattress, bed frame and surrounding environment. Sterilized fabrics from the dryer are thus easily re-infested. Continually treating materials in this fashion is labour-intensive, and in itself does not eliminate the infestation. Hot boxes Placing belongings in a hot box, a device that provides sustained heat at temperatures that kills bedbugs, larvae, and eggs, but that does not damage clothing, is an option. Pest control companies often rent the devices at nominal cost and it may make sense for frequent travelers to invest in one. Building heat treatment This method of bed bug control involves raising room temperatures to or above the killing temperature for bed bugs, which is around .Harlan, H. J. 2006. Bed bugs 101: the basics of Cimex lectularius. American Entomologist. Vol. 52(2): 99‚Äì101) Heat treatments are generally carried out by professionals, and may be performed in a single area or an entire building. Heat treatment is generally considered to be the best method of eradication because it is capable of destroying an entire infestation with a single treatment. HEPA air filtration is normally used during any heat treatment to capture particulate and biological matter that may be aerosolized during the heating process. Freezing Bed bugs can be killed by a direct one-hour exposure to temperatures of , however, bed bugs have the capacity for rapid cold hardening, i.e. an hour-long exposure to improved their subsequent tolerance of , so this may need to be maintained for longer. Freezer temperatures at or below should be sufficient to eliminate bed bugs and can be used to decontaminate household objects. This temperature range should be effective at killing eggs as well as all stages of bugs. Higher temperatures however are not effective, and survival is estimated for temperatures above even after 1 week of continuous exposure. This method requires a freezer capable of maintaining, and set to, a temperature below . Most home freezers are capable of maintaining this temperature. Fungus Preliminary research has shown the fungus Beauveria bassiana, which has been used for years as an outdoor organic pesticide, is also highly effective at eliminating bed bugs exposed to cotton fabric sprayed with fungus spores. It is also effective against bed bug colonies due to the spores carried by infected bugs back to their harborages. Unlike typical insecticides, exposure to the fungus does not kill instantly, but kills bugs within five days of exposure. Some people, especially those with compromised immune systems, may react negatively to the concentrated presence of the fungus directly following an application.  Predators  Natural enemies of bed bugs include the masked hunter (or masked bed bug hunter) insect, cockroaches,Encyclopedia Americana, 1996 ed., v. 3, p. 413 ants, spiders (particularly Thanatus flavidus), mites, and centipedes (particularly the house centipede Scutigera coleoptrata). However, biological pest control is not considered practical for eliminating bed bugs from human dwellings. While there have been few studies, the known predators of bedbugs are listed in the section on \\"parasites and predators\\" of a 1990 academic paper on bedbugs and public health.

Spencer's batting and bowling styles are not known and in his three first-class matches, one in 1891 and two in 1893, and all played when he was more than 40 years old, he batted as a tail-ender and did not bowl. His highest first-class score was 14, made in his first match, against Yorkshire, for whom George Hirst was also making his debut. Spencer had, however, played as a middle-order batsman and as an occasional bowler in other matches for Somerset during the period up to 1891 when the team's matches were not deemed first-class. Spencer's role within Somerset County Cricket Club was wider than just as a player: a history of the club indicates that at the time of the restoration of Somerset to first-class status, Spencer was helping the club secretary, H. E. Murray-Anderdon, with the administration duties, a task he handed over when Sammy Woods was recruited as an \\"amateur\\" player in need of financial assistance in 1893. Another history refers to him as the \\"diffident and effective joint secretary\\" alongside Murray-Anderdon. As a Somerset official, he attended the meeting of the County Cricket Council in December 1890 with Somerset captain Herbie Hewett at which the council unexpectedly voted to abolish itself, opening the way for the first-class counties to increase their number by arranging fixtures between themselves, with Somerset as the first beneficiary of this loosening of the rules.

Born in England, he was the son of John Greene Sr. and Joan Tattersall, and sailed to New England with his parents in 1635 aboard the ship James. His father, after coming from Massachusetts to Providence, became one of the original settlers of Warwick. In 1652 Greene served in his first public role as a commissioner from Warwick, and served in some public capacity every year until 1690 when he was first chosen as deputy governor of the colony. He then served 10 consecutive one- year terms in this capacity, retiring from public service in 1700 at the age of 80. He was one of the 10 Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries. During the devastating events of King Phillips War, Greene was one of 16 prominent inhabitants of the colony whose counsel was sought by the General Assembly. Greene died in Warwick on 27 November 1708 and was buried on the Spring Greene Farm (later the property of Governor Theodore F. Green) in Warwick. Greene married Ann Almy, the daughter of William and Audry (Barlow) Almy. They had 11 children, the youngest of whom, Samuel, married Mary Gorton, a granddaughter of Rhode Island colonial president Samuel Gorton. Their grandson, William Greene Sr. served for 11 one-year terms as a governor of the colony, and their great-grandson, also named William Greene Jr. was a governor of the State of Rhode Island. John and Ann Greene are also ancestors of United States President Warren G. Harding, as well as inventor Thomas A.

His work is known because of his group of characters from the Miguel de Cervantes' well known novel Don Quixote (The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha), among others.  Biography  Son of Cayetano Hilario, mayor of Argamasilla de Alba during the II Republic and the Spanish civil war and Juliana Abell√°n, he was the third of six sons. He affiliated with the communist party in Francoist Spain. Cayetano, like others that fought the Nationalists in the Spanish civil war went to jail during 1944‚Äî1945. He lost one of his brothers during the war, Juli√°n Hilario. He found his passion in sculpture as a child, he began his career as a bricklayer and self-taught himself the art of sculpture in his free time, it wasn't until the civil war was over when he switched his career to sculpture. His sculptures, of Quixotic, religious or costumbrism themes, can be seen in Argamasilla de Alba and other villages around. His main source of inspiration was the book Don Quijote de La Mancha, which is said to be partly written in Argamasilla de Alba. Cayetano himself helped on the restoration of the , the jail where it is said that Cervantes started writing the book while a prisoner. Because of his political views, he was once in Francoist Spain denied the prize of a contest from which he was the winner, but Cayetano, like many others in Argamasilla de Alba was a peaceful man that respected other people's opinions, in his own words: ¬´I am friend with everyone and everyone is my friend. I have friends of all ideologies. I am a religious and traditional man. I understand politics as a fight of ideas, not as a road to violence.¬ª He married Cristina Torres, with whom he had four children. Due to his artistic career, the city council named him favourite son of the town on September 7, 1979. Cayetano died in 1997. In 2016 two memorial plaques that recall the places where Cayetano Hilario lived and worked were erected in Argamasilla de Alba. Works Hilario's works are mostly shown and located at public places scattered on several towns and villages in La Mancha region. The rest of his pieces belong to private owners. Being an admirer of Auguste Rodin and Michelangelo‚Äôs sculptures, as well as a tireless reader of Cervantes‚Äôs novels, Cayetano Hilario expresses part of his artistic inspiration by materializing the main characters of Cervantes‚Äô book into ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù personages in natural sizes. In order to do so, he used the people around him basically his family and native friends as models. Don Quixote This sculptural group, inspired by the book of Don Quijote de La Mancha, consists of four masterpieces: Don Quijote, his squire Sancho Panza, his idealized Lady, Dulcinea del Toboso, and the writer Miguel de Cervantes himself, placed in main squares in Abellan's place of birth. We can admire in this group of sculptures, an impressive Don Quijote, which represents the Honourable Knight when he was still Alonso Quijano. He is humanized as an inhabitant of the Village, who would later become an idealist knight who wants to fight against the injustices of the world. The sculpture shows us Alonso Quijano while he is reading one of his countless books of chivalry orders leaning on one hand and looking up, imaging his next adventures. Sancho Panza The figure of Sancho Panza seems to be a native of the Village, as well. Sancho is carrying some wine and cheese, which are typical products from this area. Dulcinea of La Mancha The Aldonza Lorenzo sculpture- named Dulcinea of La Mancha (Dulzura of La Mancha) by Don Quijote. This sculpture has been modeled by the Sculptor into a realistic country young woman with a pitcher full of water in a confident attitude towards the future. Cervantes Abell√°n completes this sculptural group with his work on the writer Miguel de Cervantes. We can admire this great masterpiece of the Spanish writer from the 16th century. The Writer is sitting and has got a thoughtful attitude. One of his hands is holding some rolled paper and we can notice his maimed left hand, which gaves the famous Writer the nickname of The one-handed man from Lepanto. Other sculptures in honour of writers and field works Other sculptures created by the same Artist are sculptures made in honour of some well-known Spanish writers such as Azor√≠n (See picture) and the poets Miguel Hern√°ndez and Vicente Cano, and his pieces, made in recognition of several typical country professions, (such as The Shepherd, The Harvester or The Grape harvest), The National Teacher and Musicians.

The group held informal discussions on Friday afternoons to explore the philosophical implications of quantum theory. Leading members included Fritjof Capra, John Clauser, Philippe Eberhard, Nick Herbert, Jack Sarfatti, Saul-Paul Sirag, Henry Stapp, and Fred Alan Wolf.Kaiser, David. How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival. W. W. Norton & Company, 2011, p. xi‚Äìxvii, xxiii, 43ff, 101. David Kaiser argues, in How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival (2011), that the group's meetings and papers helped to nurture the ideas in quantum physics that came to form the basis of quantum information science.Kaiser 2011, p. xi‚Äìxvii. Two reviewers wrote that Kaiser may have exaggerated the group's influence on the future of physics research, though one of them, Silvan Schweber, wrote that some of the group's contributions are easy to identify, such as Clauser's experimental evidence for non-locality attracting a share of the Wolf Prize in 2010, and the publication of Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975) and Zukav's The Dancing Wu Li Masters (1979) attracting the interest of a wider audience.Johnson, George. \\"What Physics Owes the Counterculture\\", The New York Times, June 17, 2011. *Schweber, Silvan. \\"How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival\\", Times Higher Education, March 13, 2012. *Schweber, Silvan. \\"Review: How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival\\", Physics Today, September 2011, pp. 59-60. Kaiser writes that the group were \\"very smart and very playful\\", discussing quantum mysticism and becoming local celebrities in the Bay Area's counterculture. When Francis Ford Coppola bought City Magazine in 1975, one of its earliest features was on the Fundamental Fysiks Group, including a photo spread of Sirag, Wolf, Herbert, and Sarfatti.Kaiser lecture April 2010, archived, 21:00 mins, 23:22 mins; Kaiser 2011, p. xviii. Research=Bell's theorem and no-cloning theorem Hugh Gusterson writes that several challenging ideas lie at the heart of quantum physics: that electrons behave like waves and particles; that you can know a particle's location or momentum, but not both; that observing a particle changes its behavior; and that particles appear to communicate with each other across great distances, known as nonlocality and quantum entanglement. It is these concepts that led to the development of quantum information science and quantum encryption, which has been experimentally used, for example, to transfer money and electronic votes. Kaiser argues that the Fundamental Fysiks Group saved physics by exploring these ideas, in three ways: Specifically, in 1981, Nick Herbert, a member of the group, proposed a scheme for sending signals faster than the speed of light using quantum entanglement. Quantum computing pioneer Asher Peres writes that the refutation of Herbert's ideas led to the development of the no-cloning theorem by William Wootters, Wojciech Zurek, and Dennis Dieks. In a review of Kaiser's book in Physics Today, Silvan Schweber challenges Kaiser's views of the importance of the Fundamental Fysiks Group. He writes that Bell's Theorem was not obscure during the preceding decade, but was worked on by authors such as John Clauser (who was a member of the group) and Eugene Wigner. Schweber also mentioned the work of Alain Aspect, which preceded Nick Herbert's 1981 proposal.Schweber, Silvan. \\"How the Hippies Saved Physics - Reviewed by Silvan Schweber\\", Physics Today, September 2011, 59‚Äì60. Remote viewing Given quantum theory's perceived implications for the study of parapsychology and telepathy, the group cultivated patrons such as the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and the human potential movement. In 1972, the CIA and DIA set up a research program, jokingly called ESPionage,Kaiser 2011, p. 93 which financed experiments into remote viewing at the Stanford Research Institute, where the Fundamental Fysiks Group became what Kaiser calls its house theorists.Kaiser, David. \\"Lecture: How the Hippies Saved Physics\\", April 28, 2010 Cambridge Science Festival at MIT Museum, around 28:00 mins. posted at WGBH Forum Network, Retrieved from Internet Archive, May 18, 2015 See also * Epistemological Letters * The Men Who Stare at Goats * Parapsychology research at SRI NotesFurther reading *\\"25th reunion of the Fundamental Physics Group\\", quantumtantra.com, accessed August 18, 2011. *\\"Paranormal Science\\", The New York Times, November 6, 1974. *\\"How the Hippies Saved Physics (Excerpt)\\", David Kaiser, Scientific American, June 27, 2011. *Dizikes, Peter. \\"Hippie Days\\", MIT News, June 27, 2011. *Wisnioski, Matthew. \\"Let's Be Fysiksists Again\\", Science, vol 332, issue 6037, 24 June 2011, pp. 1504‚Äì1505. ;Books *Fritjof Capra.

It was established after Ottoman Empire acquired Shkodra after the siege of Shkodra in 1478-9. It was part of Rumelia Eyalet until 1867, when it became a part, together with Sanjak of Skopje, of newly established Scutari Vilayet. In 1912 and beginning of 1913 it was occupied by members of Balkan League during the First Balkan War. In 1914 the territory of Sanjak of Scutari became a part of Principality of Albania, established on the basis of peace contract signed during London Conference in 1913. History= Background and formation  With short interruptions, the territory of northern Albania, including what would become the Sanjak of Scutari, belonged to the Serbian medieval states for many centuries. The first Ottoman censuses (1431, 1467 and 1485) show a substantial presence of Slavic toponyms. The last Slavic dynasty that controlled Shkodra was Bal≈°iƒá noble family. At the end of the 14th century the city came under the control of the Republic of Venice and after Ottoman Empire acquired Shkodra from Venice after the siege of Shkodra in 1478-9, it became the centre of Sanjak of Scutari.  Acquisition of Zeta  Since he was appointed on the position of sanjakbey of the Scutari in 1496, Firuz Bey had intention to annex Zeta to Ottoman Empire. ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá who controlled neighboring Principality of Zeta maintained frequent correspondence with other Christian feudal states with intention to establish an anti-Ottoman coalition. When his brother, Stefan, betrayed him to Ottomans in 1496, ƒêuraƒë proposed to accept the suzerainty of Ottoman Empire if Firuz Bey accept to recognize him as governor in Zeta. Firuz Bey refused this proposal and invited ƒêuraƒë to either come to Scutari to clarify his anti- Ottoman activities or to flee Zeta. When Firuz Bey attacked Zeta with strong forces in 1496 ƒêuraƒë decided to flee to Venice. In 1497 Firuz Bey captured Grbalj and put Zeta under his effective military control, although it was still part of the Zeta governed by Stefan II Crnojeviƒá. In 1499 Firuz Bey formally annexed Zeta to the territory of his Sanjak of Scutari, and Zeta lost its status as an independent state. In 1514, this territory was separated from the Sanjak of Scutari and established as a separate sanjak, under the rule of Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá. When he died in 1528, the Sanjak of Montenegro was reincorporated into the Sanjak of Scutari as a unique administrative unit (vilayet) with certain degree of autonomy.  Late 16th and early 17th century  The census of 1582‚Äî1583 registered the \\"vilayet of the Black Mountain\\" (vilayet-i Kara Daƒü) as separate administrative unit within Sanjak of Scutari. The vilayet consisted of the following nahiyah and villages: Grbavci with 13 villages, ≈Ωupa 11, Malon≈°iƒái 7, Plje≈°ivci 14, Cetinje 16, Rijeka 31, Crmnica 11, Pa≈°troviƒái 36 and Grbalj 9 villages; a total of 148 villages. Marino Bizzi, the Archbishop of Bar (Antivari), in his 1610 report stated that name of the sanjakbey of Sanjak of Scutari was Ali Pasha.  Pashalik of Scutari  In the period between 1757 and 1831, the Sanjak of Scutari was elevated to the Pashalik of Scutari, a semi-autonomous pashalik under the Ottoman empire created by the Albanian Bushati family. Its territory encompassed parts of modern-day northern Albania and Montenegro, with its center in city of Shkod√´r. The weakening of Ottoman central authority and the timar system of land ownership brought anarchy to the West Balkans region of Ottoman Empire. In the late 18th century, two centers of power emerged in this region: Shkod√´r, under the Bushati family; and Janina, under Ali Pasha of Tepelen√´. Both regions cooperated with and defied the Sublime Porte as their interests required.  Scutari Vilayet  Before 1867, Shkod√´r (ƒ∞≈ükodra) was a sanjak within the Rumelia Eyalet. In 1867, the Sanjak of Scutari merged with the Sanjak of √úsk√ºb (Skopje), forming the Scutari Vilayet. The vilayet was subsequently divided into three sanjaks: ƒ∞»ôkodra (Scutari), Prizren and Dibra. In 1877, the Sanjak of Prizren was transferred to the Kosovo Vilayet, and the Sanjak of Dibra was transferred to the Monastir Vilayet. Following the territorial transfers, the Sanjak of Scutari was subsequently divided into two sanjaks: Sanjak of Scutari and Sanjak of Dra√ß (Durr√´s). Following the invasion of Montenegrin forces during the Montenegrin-Ottoman War between 1876 and 1878, ownership of the cities of Bar, Podgorica, and Ulcinj was transferred from the Sanjak of Scutari to the Principality of Montenegro. The Sanjak of Shkodra (1907) In 1900, the Vilayet of Scutari was disestablished, demerging into two separate sanjaks: Sanjak of Scutari and Sanjak of Durr√´s.  Disestablishment  In 1912 and beginning of 1913 it was occupied by members of Balkan League during the First Balkan War. In 1914 the territory of Sanjak of Scutari became a part of Principality of Albania, established on the basis of peace contract signed during London Conference in 1913.  Demographics and social organisation The majority religious population in ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak were Catholics. The Albanian Malisors (highlanders) lived in three geographical regions within ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak. Malesia e Madhe (great highlands) with its religiously mixed Catholic-Muslim five large (Hoti, Kelmendi, Shkreli, Kastrati and Gruda) and seven small tribes; Malesia e Vogel (small highlands) with seven Catholic tribes such as the Shala, Shoshi, Toplana, Nikaj; and Mirdita, which was also a large powerful tribe that could mobilise 5,000 irregular troops. The government estimated the military strength of Malisors in ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak as numbering over 30,000 tribesmen and Ottoman officials were of the view that the highlanders could defeat Montenegro on their own with limited state assistance. Ottoman control over the highland areas of ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak was limited. In the 1880s, from an Albanian point of view the sanjak of ƒ∞≈ükodra belonged to the region of Geg√´nia. Based on the people names registered in the census, it may be concluded that population of Sanjak of Scutari was mainly composed of Serbs and Albanians (Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim). There was also certain number of Vlachs, Turks and other people present, mainly in towns.  1485 census  The first Ottoman census of the Sanjak of Scutari was organized in 1485. It was the third Ottoman census which was organized on the territory within modern Republic of Albania. The first census was organized in 1431 on the territory of Sanjak of Albania. The 1485 census shows that Sanjak of Scutari consisted of four kazas: ƒ∞≈ükodra (Shkod√´r), Deped√∂ƒüen (Podgorica), ƒ∞pek (Peƒá), and Bihor. The kazas were divided into smaller administrative units, nahiyah.  1582‚Äî1583 census  The census organized in period 1582‚Äî1583 shows that there were many nahiyah within Sanjak of Scutari with following number of villages: *Shkod√´r with 128 villages * Du≈°men with 24 villages; majority had personal names with an Albanian character, minority with a Serbian character. ** Toponyms show some South Slavic influence ** Islamisation was slowly occurring within the nahiyah, based on the presence of characteristically Muslim names within its population * Zabojana with 48 villages; majority had personal names with an Albanian character, minority with a Serbian character. * Mrko with 9 villages; majority had personal names with a Serbian character, minority with an Albanian character. * Krajina with 18 villages; majority had personal names with an Albanian character ** Toponyms show an overwhelming South Slavic influence * Gorje ≈†estan (D≈æebel-i ≈†estan) with 7 villages; majority had personal names with a Serbian character, minority with an Albanian character. * Podgorica with 13 villages; majority had personal names with a Serbian character, minority with an Albanian character. * ≈Ωabljak with 8 villages; majority had personal names with a Serbian character, minority with an Albanian character. * Hoti with 8 villages; majority had personal names with an Albanian character, while a minority had with a Serbian character. * Bjelopavliƒái with 6 villages; overwhelming majority had personal names with a Serbian character * Vra≈æegrmci with 16 villages; overwhelming majority had personal names with a Serbian character * Pobor with 11 villages; overwhelming majority had personal names with a Serbian character * Klemente with 2 villages; majority had personal names with an Albanian character, minority with a Serbian character. * Kuƒçi with 13 villages; majority had personal names with a Serbian character, minority with an Albanian character. * Peƒá with 235 villages; overwhelming majority had personal names with a Serbian character; very few personal names with an Albanian character mentioned ** Islamisation was common within the nahiyah, with many Serbs and Albanians converting to Islam * Altin (Altun li) with 41 villages; relative majority had names with a Serbian character, minority with an Albanian character * Petri≈°pan with 33 villages * Budimlje with 31 villages; overwhelming majority had personal names with a Serbian character ** Presence of Muslim inhabitants shown in one village within the nahiyah * Komoran with 20 villages; overwhelming majority had personal names with a Serbian character ** Presence of Muslim inhabitants shown in two villages within the nahiyah * Plav with 18 villages; all inhabitants had personal names with a Serbian character ** No Muslim inhabitants within the nahiyah * Zla Rijeka with 12 villages There was a total of 709 villages in the Sanjak of Scutari. Additionally, a smaller part of Ottoman census from 1582‚Äî1583 dealt with Montenegro (Vil√¢yet-i Karaca-daƒü) as separate administrative unit within Sanjak of Scutari. This part consisted of following nahiyah and villages: Grbavci with 13 villages, ≈Ωupa with 11 villages, Malon≈°iƒái with 7 villages, Plje≈°ivci with 14 villages, Cetinje with 16 villages, Rijeka with 31 villages, Cernica (Crmnica) with 11 villages, Pa≈°troviƒái with 36 villages, Grbalj with 9 villages. There was a total of 148 villages belonging to the Montenegrin subdivision. The 1582‚Äî1583 census shows 857 villages and several towns including Shkod√´r (ƒ∞≈ükodra), Peƒá (ƒ∞pek), Podgorica (Deped√∂ƒüen), Bar (Bar) and Ulcinj (√úlg√ºn). 1874 estimation According to Russian consulate Ivan Yastrebov's estimations, there were 80.000 Catholic males, 20.000 Orthodox males, and 9.500 Muslim males. The majority of the population spoke the Albanian language. He asserted that the Orthodox, and a number of Catholics and Muslims spoke the Serbian language.; –ì–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∏–∫ –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ–≥ —É—á–µ–Ω–æ–≥ –¥—Ä—É—à—Ç–≤–∞, –∫—ö.

When Kjell Grede was asked why he as a Swede wanted to make a film about Danish artists, he explained: \\"The first step, when I look back, was that I was fascinated by the thought of that remote peninsula jutting out into the sea and bathed in sunshine, and of the people gathering there. The next step comes when you consider that group of people because you realise their feelings are so important to all of us ‚Äî friendship, love and beauty, all that is positive, all that is best. The third step is that when you look at them more closely, you realise that those three qualities are under threat. They are threatened with obliteration, just like the peninsula itself... Everything which means so much to us is constantly threatened by Destiny with a capital D, that same destiny we believe psychotherapists can help us overcome but which in fact tears them apart too. You can see it in the group of artists. Beauty in the paintings of the Skagen artists, it was not something intended just for the enjoyment of the upper classes. It had an important role, it was a call against a hard life, against poverty and sickness and children who died. Ours is a life of luxury when we compare our times with theirs. Beauty was something spiritual, a religious experience, a question of life and death.\\"Else Cornelius, \\"Interview with Kjell Grede\\", Berlingske Tidende, 16 February 1986.

It reignited the centuries-long warfare between the two states that would go on for another century. The Burmese were \\"on the brink of victory\\" when they suddenly withdrew from their siege of Ayutthaya because their king Alaungpaya had fallen ill. He died three weeks later, ending the war. The casus belli were over the control of the Tenasserim coast and its trade,Baker, et al, p. 21James, Fall of Ayutthaya: Reassessment, p. 75 and the Siamese support for ethnic Mon rebels of the fallen Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. The newly founded Konbaung Dynasty had wanted to reestablish Burmese authority in the upper Tenasserim coast (present-day Mon State) where the Siamese had provided support to the Mon rebels and deployed their troops. The Siamese had refused Burmese demands to hand over the rebel Mon leaders or to stop their intrusions into what the Burmese considered their territory. The war began in December 1759 when 40,000 Burmese troops led by Alaungpaya and his son Hsinbyushin invaded down the Tenasserim coast from Martaban (Mottama). Their battle plan was to go around the heavily defended Siamese positions along shorter, more direct invasion routes. The invasion force overran relatively thin Siamese defenses in the coast, crossed the Tenasserim Hills to the shore of the Gulf of Siam, and turned north towards Ayutthaya. Taken by surprise, the Siamese scrambled to meet the Burmese in their south, and put up spirited defensive stands en route to Ayutthaya. But battle-hardened Burmese forces overcame numerically superior Siamese defenses and reached the outskirts of Siamese capital on 11 April 1760. But only five days into the siege, the Burmese king suddenly fell ill and the Burmese command decided to withdraw. An effective rearguard operation by Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta allowed for an orderly withdrawal. The war was inconclusive. While the Burmese regained control of the upper coast down to the Tavoy (Dawei), they had not eliminated the threat to their hold on the peripheral regions, which remained tenuous. They were forced to deal with Siamese-supported ethnic rebellions in the coast (1762, 1764) as well as in Lan Na (1761‚Äì1763). The Burmese would launch their next invasion in 1765, and topple the four-century-old Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767. Background=Tenasserim coast to 1740 The control of Tenasserim coast (present-day Mon State and Taninthayi Region in Myanmar) in the early 18th century was divided between Burma and Siam, with the Burmese controlling down to Tavoy (Dawei) and the Siamese controlling the rest. Throughout history, both kingdoms had claimed the entire coast--(the Siamese to Martaban, and the Burmese to Junkceylon), and control had changed hands several times. The Burmese Pagan Dynasty controlled the entire coast until 1287. Throughout 14th and 16th centuries, Siamese kingdoms (first Sukhothai, later Ayutthaya) controlled much of the coast, up to just south of present-day Mawlamyaing. In the mid-16th century, the Burmese under Toungoo kings Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung tried to regain the coast, first failing in 1548, and finally succeeding in 1564 when they conquered all of Siam for the first time. The Siamese revolted in 1584, and under their king Naresuan regained the lower coast by 1593 and the entire coast by 1594. The Burmese retook the upper coast down to Tavoy in 1615 but failed to recover the rest.James, SEA encyclopedia, pp. 1318‚Äì1319 This arrangement lasted until 1740 (although the Siamese unsuccessfully tried to take the upper coast in 1662‚Äì65). During this period, Mergui (Myeik) on the Andaman Sea was the primary port of Siam through which its trade with India and the West was conducted. Burmese civil war (1740‚Äì57) Tenasserim coast prior to war shown in three colors; Tavoy Frontier was contested In 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma revolted against the Toungoo Dynasty and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom based in Pegu (Bago). Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma since a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam. (After all, it was then Pegu-based Toungoo Dynasty in the 16th century that turned to Siam after having first conquered Upper Burma.) Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban (Mottama) and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava (Inwa) to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs.Wyatt, p. 113 By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751.Ba Pe, pp. 145‚Äì146Hall, Chapter IX: Mon Revolt, p. 15 (Or it could have been an opportunistic land-grab while Restored Hanthawaddy armies were deeply involved in Upper Burma.) While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended (or possessed the military capability) to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752.Phayre, pp. 150‚Äì151 This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room. The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10,000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma. (Historians call the redeployment premature, pointing out that the Siamese threat was never as grave as any counterforce that could rise from Upper Burma, the traditional home of political power in Burma.) Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops, one resistance group, the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754. Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma in 1755, and captured Pegu in 1757, ending the 17-year-old Mon kingdom.Harvey, pp. 219‚Äì243Hall, Chapter X: Alaungpaya, pp. 16‚Äì24 Siamese policy change and support of Mon resistance For the Siamese, the situation they had feared‚Äîthe emergence of a strong power in Burma‚Äîhad come true although it was the Upper Burma-based Konbaung Dynasty, not Restored Hanthawaddy they were originally concerned about. (Ironically, the Siamese were partly responsible for the initial success of Konbaung Dynasty as their occupation of the upper coast helped divert the main body of Hanthawaddy troops southward.) In a policy switch, they now actively supported Mon resistance groups still operating in the upper coast where Burmese control was still nominal. After the Konbaung sack of Pegu in 1757, the governors of Martaban and Tavoy had sent in tribute to Alaungpaya to avoid the same fate.Harvey, p. 241 (The Tavoy governor turned out to be paying dual tribute, and would be executed later.) While the Burmese now claimed the upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy, their hold of Lower Burma was still tenuous and especially in the southernmost Tenasserim coast it was largely nominal. Indeed, once Konbaung armies returned north in 1758 for their expeditions in Manipur and northern Shan States, the Mon of Lower Burma rose in rebellion.Htin Aung, pp. 167‚Äì168 The rebellion initially was successful, driving out the Burmese governor from Pegu. It was eventually put down by local Konbaung garrisons. Mon resistance leaders and their followers fled to the Siamese controlled Tenasserim coast and remained active there. The border became the scene of chronic raiding and counter-raiding.Hall, Chapter X, p. 24 Casus belli Alaungpaya was concerned by the continuing flow of Mon rebels to the Siamese controlled territories, believing that the Mons would always be plotting to rebel and win back Lower Burma. (His concern proved justified. The Mons put up several rebellions in 1758, 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824‚Äì1826. Each failed rebellion was followed by more Mon flight to Siam.Lieberman, p. 205) Alaungpaya demanded that the Siamese stop their support of the Mon rebels, surrender their leaders, and cease intrusions into the upper coast, which he considered Burmese territory. The Siamese king Ekkathat refused Burmese demands, instead prepared for war.Htin Aung, pp. 169‚Äì170 While historians generally agree that the Siamese support of the Mon rebels and their cross border raids were some of the causes of war, they do not agree on (other) ulterior motives. Some British colonial era historians of Burmese history (Arthur Phayre, GE Harvey) outright downplay the aforementioned reasons as \\"pretexts\\", and have suggested that the primary cause of the war was Alaungpaya's desire to restore Bayinnaung's empire, (which included Siam).Harvey, pp. 241, 250Phayre, pp. 168‚Äì169 David Wyatt, a historian of Thai history, acknowledges that Alaungpaya could have feared \\"Ayutthaya's backing for the revival of the Kingdom of Pegu\\" but adds that Alaungpaya, \\"apparently a rather crude country fellow with scant experience of statecraft was simply continuing to do what he early demonstrated he could do best: lead armies to warfare\\".Wyatt, p. 116 But Burmese historian Htin Aung strongly counters that their analyses greatly understate Alaungpaya's genuine concern for his still nascent and unstable rule in Lower Burma, and that Alaungpaya never invaded Arakan as the Arakanese never showed him any hostility, although Sandoway (Thandwe) in southern Arakan had sent him tribute in 1755. Thant Myint-U also points out the Siamese longstanding policy of keeping \\"a buffer against their aged-old enemies the Burmese\\" has extended down to the modern era where families of insurgent Burmese leaders are allowed to live in Thailand, and insurgent armies are free to buy arms, ammunition, and other supplies.Myint-U, pp. 287, 299 Later Western historians provide a somewhat more balanced view. D.G.E. Hall writes that the \\"chronic raiding\\" by the Siamese and Mon rebels \\"alone would have provided an adequate casus belli\\" although he adds \\"for a monarch unable to settle down to a peaceable existence\\". Steinberg, et al., concur that the casus belli grew out of a local rebellion in Tavoy in which the Siamese were thought to be involved.Steinberg, p. 102 More recently, Helen James states that Alaungpaya likely wanted to capture Siam's trans-peninsula trade, while granting that his \\"subsidiary motivation\\" was to stop Siamese attacks and Siamese support for the Mons. Prelude to war=Siamese battle plan In 1758, at the death of King Boromakot, Ayutthaya was the wealthiest city in mainland Southeast Asia. After a brief succession struggle, one of Borommakot's sons Ekkathat emerged as king after another son Uthumphon gave up the throne to become a monk. As king, Ekkathat faced the developing situation in the west, left behind by his father. He refused Alaungpaya's demands, and prepared for war. The Siamese battle plan was a defensive one. Ekkathat improved the defenses of Ayutthaya and took up prepared positions all along the routes that the previous Burmese invasions had followed. The main Siamese forces were massed to the westward approaches of Ayutthaya.Hall, Chapter X, p. 24 (Previous Burmese invasions had always come via the Three Pagodas Pass in the west, and sometimes also by Chiang Mai in the north.) Ekkathat's Ayutthaya defenses included a small number of Dutch-manned warships, as well as several cannon-mounted war-boats manned by foreigners (\\"feringhis and Mahomedans\\").Harvey, pp. 241, 246 To guard the coast and the Gulf of Siam flank, he deployed two smaller armies, totaling 20 regiments (27,000 men, 1300 cavalry and 500 elephants). Of the total, only 7000 men and 300 cavalry were deployed in the Tenasserim coast itself. Ekkathat asked his old rival and brother Uthumphon to leave the monkhood, and made him the commander-in-chief. Burmese battle plan The Burmese too had begun to assemble their invasion force, starting during their new year celebrations in April 1759, gathering troops from all over Upper Burma, including from recently conquered northern Shan States and Manipur. By late 1759, Alaungpaya had massed a force of 40 regiments (40,000 men including 3000 cavalry) at Yangon. Of the 3000 cavalry, 2000 were Manipuri \\"Cassay Horse\\", who had just been press-ganged into Alaungpaya's service after the Burmese conquest of Manipur in 1758.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, pp. 141‚Äì142 The Burmese battle plan was to go around the heavily defended Siamese positions along the Three Pagodas Pass-Ayutthaya corridor. They selected a longer but less defended route: Go south to Tenasserim, cross the Tenasserim Hills over to Gulf of Siam, and turn north to Ayutthaya. To that end, the Burmese had assembled a fleet of 300 ships to transport a portion of their troops directly to the Tenasserim coast. Alaungpaya was to lead the invasion personally, and his second son Hsinbyushin was his second-in-command. His first son Naungdawgyi was left to administer the country. (Two of his other sons a 14-year-old Bodawpaya and a 16-year-old Amyint Mintha were to lead a small battalion each.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, pp. 143‚Äì145) Also in his service were his top generals including the likes of Minkhaung Nawrahta who like all Burmese leadership had plenty of military experience. Some in the court urged him to stay behind and allow Hsinbyushin to lead the operation but the king refused. War=First clashes of war According to the Burmese chronicles, the first clashes of war occurred towards the end of the monsoon season in the Tavoy frontier. On 20 September 1759 (15th waning of Tawthalin 1121 ME), Alaungpaya was informed of Siamese attacks on Burmese shipping around Tavoy and continued Siamese intrusions into the Tavoy frontier.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, p. 229 To be sure, it could very well be Burmese justification but it could also be that the Siamese were already enforcing their forward perimeter even by then. Battle of Tenasserim coast right On 21 December 1759 (3rd waxing of Pyatho 1121 ME), Alaungpaya and his invasion army left Yangon for Martaban at the frontier. At Martaban, instead of taking the usual route via the Three Pagodas Pass, the Burmese invaded south, with Hsinbyushin leading the vanguard of six regiments (5000 men, 500 horses) to Tavoy. Tavoy was easily occupied, and its hapless governor, who was torn between two greater powers and paying dual tribute, was executed. The Burmese army paused for three days for the rest of army to arrive by land and by sea. The army then moved south towards Mergui, and easily overran a vastly outnumbered Siamese force of 7,000 men and 300 cavalry. In less than two weeks of the war, the Burmese had captured both Mergui and the town of Tenasserim, and controlled the entire Tennaserim coast. Battle of Gulf of Siam Knowing that the main Siamese armies would be moving to their south to meet his armies, Alaungpaya did not pause. The Burmese troops quickly moved eastward, crossed over the Tenasserim Hills, and reached present-day Prachuap Khiri Khan Province on the shore of the Gulf of Siam. The southern flank was defended by a Siamese army of 20,000, 1000 cavalry and 200 elephants, in addition to the 7000-strong Siamese army that retreated from Tenasserim.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, pp. 146‚Äì147 Likewise, because of the minimal Siamese resistance in the coast, the 40,000-strong Burmese army was still largely intact although the invasion army was hemmed in the narrow strip of coastline by the Gulf. The Siamese defenses met the invading force outside Kui Buri but were forced to retreat. The Burmese also captured Pranburi. But their advance to Ayutthaya afterwards was greatly slowed by increasingly stiff Siamese resistance. The Siamese reinforced the southern front with a land and naval force, totaling 60,000 men with 4000 guns. The guns in the land force were mounted on carriages and elephants while those in the naval force were placed on war boats. Over the next two months (February and March 1760), battle-hardened Burmese forces overcame several spirited Siamese stands, and took Phetchaburi (Phetburi) and Ratchaburi (Ratburi). Battle of Suphanburi By capturing Ratchaburi, the Burmese had now fought their way out of the narrow isthmus, and made it to mainland Siam. It was late March 1760 (early Tagu 1121 ME). As the invasion army approached Ayutthaya, the Siamese forces, which already suffered heavy losses in men, guns and ammunition, made another stand at Suphanburi, immediately to west of the capital. The defenses consisted of over 33,000 men (including 3,000 cavalry), and their mission was to stop the Burmese from crossing the river that separates Ayutthaya from Suphanburi. The Burmese launched a three pronged attack (led by Hsinbyushin in the center flanked by generals Minkhaung Nawrahta and Minhla Thiri) on heavily fortified Siamese positions. The Burmese took heavy losses but ultimately prevailed, taking five senior Siamese commanders and their war elephants.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, pp. 147‚Äì148 Siege of Ayutthaya Siamese city of Ayutthaya Despite heavy losses at Suphanburi, the Burmese army had to march on towards Ayutthaya. They could not rest since the monsoon season was a little over a month away. As Ayutthaya was surrounded by several rivers, laying siege in the rainy season would have been a daunting task. The whole country would be under several feet of water. Half of the remaining Burmese forces were down with dysentery and Alaungpaya himself was not well.Harvey, p. 242 Nevertheless, the Burmese arrived at the environs of Ayutthaya on 11 April 1760. The Siamese sent a new 15,000-strong army to meet the invaders. But the force, which was probably made up of fresh conscripts, was promptly defeated by the battle-hardened Burmese army, though no longer in full strength. To avoid a long siege, the Burmese king sent envoys into the city, calling upon the Siamese king to surrender, promising that he would not be dethroned. Ekkathat sent envoys of his own to negotiate but found Alaungpaya's terms unacceptable, and negotiations broke down completely.Htin Aung, pp. 169‚Äì170 Starting on 14 April, during the Burmese and Siamese new year's celebrations, the Burmese began bombarding the city itself for the next three days. But the Burmese king's health deteriorated rapidly. He was suffering from either dysentery or scrofula. (According to the Siamese sources, he was wounded by the bursting of a shell from a battery whose installation he was personally supervising but the Burmese sources definitely state that he became ill with dysentery. There was no reason for the Burmese chronicles to hide the truth since it is more glorious for a Burmese king to die of wounds received on the battlefield than to die of a common ailment. Moreover, if he had been wounded in the full view of the army, it would have been known to the whole army, creating confusion.) Rearguard The Burmese command kept Alaungpaya's serious illness a secret and ordered a general withdrawal, giving the excuse that the king was indisposed. The king selected the friend of his childhood, Minkhaung Nawrahta, for the signal honor of commanding the rearguard. These were the \\"pick of the army\\"‚Äî500 cavalry and 6000 men, every man of whom had a musket. Minkhaung Nawrahta spread them out and waited. It was two days before the Siamese realized that the main Burmese army had left. The full Siamese force then came out. His men watched the ring closing round them, and fearing to be cut off, pleaded the general to let them fight further back. But he said \\"Friends, the safety of our Lord the King lies in our keeping. Let us not fight further back lest the sounds of guns break his further sleep.\\" With his leadership, the Burmese forces withdrew in good order, collecting army stragglers along the way. Death of Alaungpaya and end of war Alaungpaya died on 11 May 1760 near Martaban, after being rushed by the advance guard. With his death, the war ended. Aftermath After Alaungpaya's death, the new Burmese king Naungdawgyi was embroiled in several rebellions, including that of Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta, and could not resume the war. The war was inconclusive. For all their work, the Burmese gained little of their original objectives. Siam very much remained a thorn to the stability of Burmese peripheral regions. In the following years, Siam continued to provide support to Mon rebels in the south who raised a major rebellion in 1762 as well as those in Lan Na in the north (1761‚Äì63). The only lasting territorial gain the Burmese achieved was the upper Tenasserim coast, on which they previously had only a nominal claim. (The Siamese retook the lower coast up to Mergui in 1761.) Although the Siamese troops no longer openly intruded the border, the Mon rebels continued to operate from the Siamese territory. In 1764, the Mon governor of Tavoy, who was made governor by Alaungpaya only four years earlier, revolted until it was put down in November 1764. Likewise, the instabilities in Lan Na resumed soon after the Burmese army left in February 1764, forcing the army to return again later in the year.Kyaw Thet, p. 300 The inconclusive nature of the war would lead to the next war in 1765. Analysis The Burmese success in getting to Ayutthaya is generally attributed to their strategy of going around the established Siamese defenses along the traditional invasion routes. But it is not clear it was the main reason for their success. While the Burmese made the right decision to first attack a lightly defended Tenasserim coast (only 7000 troops), once they had crossed over to the side of Gulf of Siam, they faced increasingly stiff Siamese resistance. Though the Siamese were initially surprised by the Burmese attack route, they readjusted, and shifted their main forces south. In fact, the latter battles by the Gulf of Siam were costly for the invasion force. The Burmese chronicles report that the Burmese took substantial losses just to break out of the narrow isthmus although they also report that the Siamese also lost more men and ammunition. (Indeed, the Burmese found the geography of the narrow isthmus so unfavorable to the attacking force that they would revert to attacking Ayutthaya through more direct routes in their next invasion in 1765.) A more likely reason for Burmese success could be that the Burmese, who had been fighting successive wars since 1740, were much more battle-hardened. Their military leaders were all \\"self-made military men\\",Lieberman, p. 185 all of whom had substantial military experience under their belt. On the other hand, it is not clear how much military experience the Siamese leaders or their soldiers had since Siam had been at peace for a long time. The Siamese king had to ask his brother to disrobe to lead the war. The lack of military experience of the Siamese command, probably explains why the Siamese defenses despite having geographic defensive advantages and numerical superiority still lost to a smaller, partial-strength Burmese army along the Gulf of Siam, as well as at Suphanburi and outside Ayutthaya. Likewise, without good leadership, the use of foreign mercenaries did not appear to have made a noticeable difference. (The Burmese burned ships manned by foreign mercenaries.) History shows that leadership mattered when most soldiers on both sides were conscripts. The same Siamese conscripts under more capable leaders in another ten years would prove as formidable as any in mainland Southeast Asia, and go on to redress their \\"historical military inferiority to Burma\\".Lieberman, p. 216 Significance The war marked the resumption of warfare between the two kingdoms that had been dormant since 1665. The inconclusive nature of this war would lead to more wars that would go on until 1854. From a geopolitical standpoint, Burma now had a firmer, though still by no means complete, hold on the upper Tenasserim coast. Still, the southward shift of the line of control was strategically important. The Burmese would launch their next invasion from Tavoy in 1765, (not Martaban as was the case in 1759).

Held annually since 2005 at the Tony Award-winning Trinity Repertory Company, in Providence, Rhode Island, YASI is taught by the theater's resident acting company and education staff. Students are able to choose from a variety of different classes, including playwriting, painting and drawing, improvisation, Shakespeare, film and more.  Structure  YASI takes place during the month of July and culminates in performances featuring scene, monologues and musical theater selections. The program usually lasts five weeks, excluding weekends and holidays. The first week starts participants with age appropriate improv games and an \\"audition day\\"; and the last week is spent in rehearsal for a final showcase. Normal days are divided into four elective blocks and one extended period of time used for mandatory scene study, rehearsal or learning about the technical aspects of theater. The elective blocks are varied in subject matter and range from yoga to improvisation to playwriting. In addition to the final showcase performances, there is also a full length production of a Shakepearean play done by the high school students in the 'YASI Shakes' program. In the summer of 2011, a new mini camp was created called YASI Jr. YASI Jr. is a 5-day program giving kids too young for YASI a chance to experience what it's like to be at YASI.  Participant Life  In addition to normal classes, many extra events occur. Musical or theatrical guests often come to perform. Every year, there has been a rock-paper-scissors tournament and a game called \\"Boom Roasted\\". There is also a Lip Sync Battle every year and the winner(s) get to smash a piece of art filled with cream.  Awards  There are daily prizes. These prizes are awarded to the attendees who have helped throughout the day in various ways such as cleaning up during lunch and snack, or helping the counselors and teaching artists. Prizes vary from day to day. At the end of the program, special participants are recognized with induction to the Gryffindor club (an homage to Gryffindor of Harry Potter).

The boot is clipped into the binding, which is almost flush with the ski, and the control arm, black, is in place behind the skiers calf. The Nava System was a ski binding and custom ski boot offered for sale in the 1980s. The system used a combination of flexible sole plate to keep the boot centered, and a spring- loaded plastic arm on the rear binding that was used to transmit sideways motions of the leg to the ski. This eliminated the need for a hard shell on the boot; the Nava boot was soft and resembled a knee-high winter boot. In spite of numerous endorsements by racing stars, the system never caught on and sales ended by the late 1980s. History The system was invented in the early 1970s by an Italian architect and skier, Antonio Faullin. He patented the design and sold the production rights in the mid-1970s. No production commenced, and the design was subsequently sold off to a number of manufacturers.Swett The design eventually found its way to Pier Luigi Nava, an avid skier whose company produced motorcycle helmets. Using injection moulding construction techniques used for the helmets, Nava was able to develop a polyurethane boot plate that replaced the former metal models.Masia, pg.38 Metal plate bindings were popular in the 1970s, but the hard plate was difficult to walk on and subject to wear; Nava's soft plate and boot eliminated both problems. Nava first showed the system in April 1983 in Italy, and started sales in the winter of 83/84, and Canada in 1985. Frank Vener, an American who marketed a number of European brands in the US, started Nava Leisure USA and started sales in February 1986. There were two models, the Sansicario sold for $495 while the Cortina sold for $595,Gilmore, p.111. both well at the high end of the market. Early reviews were generally positive.Cole, pg. 38 Reviewers noted how easy it was to ski all day long without the discomfort of normal boots, and then clip out and walk normally in the boots off the slopes. It was also noted that system did not function well if one skied backwards, and also failed to transmit fore-and-aft forces that are sometimes used, especially in bumps. The company hoped that the high price would not be a barrier to skiers who were tired of putting up with sore legs and feet. This did not turn out to be the case. After two years of sales efforts in the US, the Nava system disappeared. Description A ski binding has to provide two types of support. One is a locking function that keeps the ski under the boot, but releases when too much strain is placed on the binding (as in the case of a fall). In the Nava System, this was provided by the sole plate and the ski bindings, in the same general way as any modern binding. The other function transmits sideways motions of the leg, which creates rolling motions around the long axis of the ski. This allows the skier to rotate the ski onto its edge, initiating a turn. With conventional boots and bindings, this is accomplished by using a very stiff plastic cuff locked around the lower leg. When the leg is rotated to the side, the cuff transmits the rotation through the bindings to the ski. The Nava System eliminated the stiff cuff and replaced it with a stiff plastic covered metal control arm. It extended straight up from the rear of the binding and was topped with a semi- circular cuff that fit the back of the calf. A plastic plate on the back of the boot spread the load onto the calf. When the leg was rotated to the side, the cuff transmitted this motion through the arm to the binding. The boot was eliminated from needing to transmit the forces. Nava claimed this resulted in more direct control. To enter the binding, the skier rotated the arm rearward, stepped into the binding, and released the arm so it rotated forward onto the calf. When the skier removed the bindings, or fell and was ejected, the arm rotated all the way to the ski. This made the cuff section extend past the bottom of the ski, forming a ski brake.

The battle for the monastery lasted all day, with the number of Jewish fighters killed given by one source as forty, though other estimates are much lower. Another source states eighty Arabs were killed. During the evening of 30 April the area was shaken by two large explosions. By the following day, 1 May, the Jews had complete control of the area.

Because of the continual wars between Spain and the Moro people, the areas in and around the Sulu Sea became a haven for piracy which was not suppressed until the beginning of the 20th century. The pirates of that period should not be confused with the naval forces or privateers of the various Moro tribes. However, many of the pirates operated under government sanction during time of war. Following the end of World War II, piracy in the Sulu Sea reemerged as a phenomenon that persists to this day. Historical piracy=Ships The pirate ships used by the Moros include various designs like the paraw, pangayaw, garay, and lanong. The majority were wooden sailing galleys (lanong) about ninety feet long with a beam of twenty feet (). They carried around fifty to 100 crewmen. Moros usually armed their vessels with three swivel guns, called lelahs or lantakas, and occasionally a heavy cannon. Proas were very fast and the pirates would prey on merchant ships becalmed in shallow water as they passed through the Sulu Sea. Slave trading and raiding was also very common, the pirates would assemble large fleets of proas and attack coastal towns. Hundreds of Christians were captured and imprisoned over the centuries, many were used as galley slaves aboard the pirate ships. Weapons Other than muskets and rifles, the Moro pirates, as well as the navy sailors and the privateers, used a sword called the kris with a wavy blade incised with blood channels. The wooden or ivory handle was often heavily ornamented with silver or gold. The type of wound inflicted by its blade makes it difficult to heal. The kris was used often used in boarding a vessel. Moros also used a Kampilan, another sword, a knife, or barong and a spear, made of bamboo and an iron spearhead. The Moro's swivel guns were not like more modern guns used by the world powers but were of a much older technology, making them largely inaccurate, especially at sea. Lantakas dated back to the 16th century and were up to six feet long, requiring several men to lift one. They fired up to a half-pound cannonball or grape shot. A lantaka was bored by hand and were sunk into a pit and packed with dirt to hold them in a vertical position. The barrel was then bored by a company of men walking around in a circle to turn drill bits by hand. History The Spanish engaged the Moro pirates frequently in the 1840s. The expedition to Balanguingui in 1848 was commanded by Brigadier Jos√© Ruiz with a fleet of nineteen small warships and hundreds of Spanish Army troops. They were opposed by at least 1,000 Moros holed up in four forts with 124 cannons and plenty of small arms. There were also dozens of proas at Balanguingui but the pirates abandoned their ships for the better defended fortifications. The Spanish stormed three of the positions by force and captured the remaining one after the pirates had retreated. Over 500 prisoners were freed in the operation and over 500 Moros were killed or wounded, they also lost about 150 proas. The Spanish lost twenty-two men killed and around 210 wounded. The pirates later reoccupied the island in 1849. Another expedition was sent which encountered only light resistance. In the 1840s, James Brooke became the White Rajah of Sarawak and led a series of campaigns against the Moro pirates. In 1843 Brooke attacked the pirates of Malludu and in June 1847 he participated in a major battle with pirates at Balanini where dozens of proas were captured or sunk. Brooke fought in several more anti-piracy actions in 1849 as well. During one engagement off Mukah with Illanun Sulus in 1862, his nephew, ex-army Captain Brooke, sank four proas, out of six engaged, by ramming them with his small four-gun steamship Rainbow. Each pirate ship had over 100 crewmen and galley slaves aboard and was armed with three brass swivel guns. Brooke lost only a few men killed or wounded while at least 100 pirates were killed or wounded. Several prisoners were also released. Despite Spanish efforts to eradicate the pirate threat, piracy persisted until the early 1900s. Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States as a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, after which American troops embarked on a pacification campaign from 1903 to 1913 that extended American rule to the southern Philippines and effectively suppressed piracy. Modern-day piracy=History Piracy reemerged in the immediate post-WWII period as a result of the detoriation of the security situation and the wide availability of military surplus engines and modern firearms. The British authorities in North Borneo recorded 232 pirate attacks between 1959 and 1962. During this early period of piracy, pirates primarily targeted barter traders engaged in the copra trade, but also attacked fishing and passenger vessels and conducted coastal raids on villages. As an example, in 1985, pirates caused chaos in the town of Lahad Datu in Sabah, killing 21 people and injuring 11 others. The armed insurgencies of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), founded in 1972, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), founded in 1977, provided a new impetus to piracy, with both organisations engaging in piracy to fund their armed struggle. 16 out of 155 pirate attacks taking place in the Philippines in 2003 were attributed to MILF, and MNLF has engaged in the extortion of fishermen, threatening to attack them if they did not pay protection money. Similarly, Abu Sayyaf, founded in the early 1990s, has frequently perpetrated piracy attacks, both to fund the organization and for personal financial gain. Methodology Piracy in the Sulu Sea is mostly perpetrated by small teams of less than ten people, which are usually well-armed, and tend to be more violent than their counterparts in other areas of the world, often killing their victims by shooting them or having them jump over board, leaving them to drown. Weapons used by pirates include normal handguns and rifles such as AK47, M16, M1 Garand, and FN FAL. Pirates almost exclusively target small vessels, including fishing vessels, passenger ships and transport vessels. While the pirates primarily aim to steal personal belongings, cargo and fishers' catch, they also sometimes take hostages for ransom. Further, pirates sometimes take the vessels' outboard motors or the vessel in its entirety, either to sell later or to keep for themselves Piracy statistics Statistics on the amount of piracy incidents taking place in the Sulu Sea are unreliable due to various factors. On the one hand, incidents in the Sulu Sea are usually counted into statistics for the entirety of the Philippines and Malaysia. On the other hand, the reliability of statistics suffers from underreporting. Since the primary targets of pirates in this area are small vessels, these incidents are often not counted into the official statistics, which are primarily concerned with attacks on commercial vessels. Victims are also often reluctant to report incidents to the authorities because they feel that their reports would not result in anything or because they do not trust the authorities. It has been estimated that during the 1980s, around 100 pirate attacks took place in the Sulu Sea each year. Factors behind piracy Despite efforts by Malaysian and Philippine authorities to curb piracy in the Sulu Sea, the problem continues to persist. Weak maritime law enforcement, corruption, rivalries between the involved states, and unresolved territorial claims are major barriers to an effective suppression of piracy. Security forces sometimes are involved in organising piratical activities as well, supplying weapons and intel to pirates. The littoral nature of the Sulu Sea makes it easy for pirates to surprise victims and evade law enforcement. On land, the poor economic conditions in the area drive people to resort to various forms of crime to make a living, including piracy. Piracy, in turn, exacerbates the economic deprivation of the population, as the primary targets are locals themselves. The continued existence of groups like Abu Sayyaf and MILF is also to blame for the prevalence of piracy. Not only do these groups engage in piracy themselves, efforts by security forces to suppress them have also drawn resources that could be used to deal with piracy. These efforts may also drive the local population towards piracy, as security forces frequently harass farmers, depriving them of their livelihood. Small arms proliferation in the area is also high as a result of weak state authority and the armed struggle of these groups, making it easy for pirates to acquire weapons. Cultural factors may also play a part, with most of modern-day pirates in the Sulu Sea being descended from their historical predecessors, adding an element of cultural sanction to piracy. It has been suggested that piracy may in part be motivated by associated virtues such as honor and masculinity, which pirates can display by taking part in an operation. Piracy is also not seen as an inherently criminal activity by the population living at the edge of the Sulu Sea, which is reflected in the local languages.

The mid-section of the book provides information on the Githyanki, the indigenous species on the Astral, which is suggested as an optional player race. The final section of the guide deals with other creatures that live on the plane, and describes a few locations. Publication historyReception Trenton Webb reviewed A Guide to the Astral Plane for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. He quips that: \\"The problem with Planescape is that it inspires an almost ceaseless tide of high-quality accessories, and such creativity puts a strain on both the finances and campaigns of referees. The Guide to the Astral Plane further exacerbates this problem.\\" He comments that \\"The Guide breathes life into what had hitherto been little more than a planar motorway. Essentially infinite and filled with few 'solid locations' or indigenous species, the Astral Plane should by rights be a dull place. Yet with some deft imaginative touches and sleight of logic, the guide transforms this dead zone into a wonderfully different 'world'.\\" Webb adds: \\"By expanding the accepted 'physics' of the Astral plane and applying classic Planescape thinking, the Silver Void is made solid and comprehensible. Rules for astral travel, zero- gravity combat and spellcasting are crisply and clearly explained - all concepts that will add extra spice to normal play and properly emphasise the unique nature of this inner space.\\" He continues \\"For these rules to have any practical value, though, the Astral Plane has to be worth exploring. And for that it needs people and places. The mid-section of the guide's response is more information than even an Illithid would want on the Githyanki - the indigenous species on the Astral. Such depth is necessary because it's suggested as an optional player race, but while as non-player characters the Githyanki boast some excellent twists and Astral-specific spells, as PCs they would be little more than dextrous, not to mention ugly, egg layers.\\" Webb concludes his review by saying, \\"The final section of the guide deals with those other beasties who make the void their home and the few areas that actually 'exist.. Many of the monsters have been met before in other Planescape sourcebooks, but the locations are excellent, original work - the Bonecloud (a zombie swarm) and Divinity Leech (a fortress that sucks energy from the corpses of gods) take the bizarre nature of this plane to its logical extreme. All of the locations are dutifully different and the majority are truly inspired, so they're well worth running the void for.\\" Reviews *Pryamid #25 References Category:Planescape ","title":"A Guide to the Astral Plane"},{"id":"31614019","text":"Dark Sun Campaign Setting, Expanded and Revised is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1995.

The tower house, which is in the parish of Breage, is a Grade I listed building. Parts of the building date from the early 16th century. Description The tower house is of late medieval date and features one of the few towers of its type preserved in Britain.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books; pp. 72, 134 Lysons (1814) wrote as follows: \\"There are considerable remains of an ancient castellated mansion on this estate, called Pendersick Castle, the principal rooms in which are made use of as granaries and hay-lofts; one of them, which is nearly entire, is wainscotted in panels; the upper part of the wainscot is ornamented with paintings, each of which is accompanied with appropriate verses and proverbs in text hand\\".Lysons, Daniel & Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol.3: Cornwall, 1814 History It was built in about 1510 by William Worth.http://www.castlesuncovered.com/england/pengersickcastle.html The Worth family originated at the manor of Worth in the parish of Washfield in Devon. Elizabeth Worth, a daughter of Thomas Worth (fl.1467), married John Militon of Meavy in Devon.Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.)

John Milliton of Pengersick Castle became High Sheriff of Cornwall. Sabine Baring-Gould wrote as follows:Sabine Baring-Gould, \\"Book of the West\\", Vol.2, Cornwall, 1899, p 289 :\\"Near Germoe, but nearer the sea is a very fine remnant of a castle, Pengersick. It was erected in the time of Henry VIII by a man named Millaton, probably of Millaton in Bridestow, Devon. He had committed murder and to escape justice he fled his native country and hid himself in the dip of land facing the sea at Pengersick, where he constructed at tower amply protected with means of defence. The basement is furnished with loops for firing upon anyone approaching, and above the door is a shoot for melted lead. The entire building is beautifully constructed. Here Millaton remained in concealment until he died, never leaving his tower for more than a brief stroll. The land had not been purchased in his own name, but in that of his son Job. Job was made governor of Saint Michael's Mount and his son, William, was made sheriff of Cornwall in 1565 and married Honor Godolphin, daughter of Sir William Godolphin\\". Pengersick Castle was improved circa 1530 as a fortified manor house using the proceeds of the wreck of a valuable Portuguese ship.Pengersick Castle Job Militon (f.1547) of Pengersick Castle was Governor of Saint Michael's Mount, Cornwall, in 1547.Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.3, Cornwall Haunted by ghosts Rumours of ghosts and devil-worshipBBC Cornwall: A night at Pengersick surround the castle.

Early life He was the fourth son of John Anderson (26 June 1796 - 22 January 1870), a member of the firm of Matthews, Anderson, & Co., bankers and merchants of Saint Petersburg, by his wife Frances, daughter of Dr. Simpson. He was educated at the Saint Petersburg high commercial school, of which he became head. He carried off the silver medal, and although an English subject received the freedom of the city in consideration of his attainments. When he left Russia in 1849 he was proficient in English, Russian, German, and French. In 1849, he became a student in the Applied Sciences department at King's College, London, and on leaving became an associate. He next served a pupilage at the works of Sir William Fairbairn in Manchester, where he remained three years. In 1855 he joined the firm of Courtney, Stephens, & Co., of the Blackhall Place Ironworks, Dublin. There he did much general engineering work. He also designed several cranes, and was the first to adopt the braced web in bent cranes. In 1863 he became president of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland. Career In 1864 he joined the firm of Easton and Amos of the Grove, Southwark, and went to live at Erith, where the firm had decided to construct new works on a riverside site at Anchor Bay, east of Erith's centre. He became a partner, and eventually head, of the firm which at a later date was styled Easton and Anderson. At Erith he had the chief responsibility in designing and laying out the works. Part of the business of the firm at that time was the construction of pumping machinery. Anderson materially improved the pattern of centrifugal pump devised by John George Appold. While in Erith, he also contributed to the establishment of local schools, serving for 27 years on the Erith School Board, which he chaired from 1886 until his death. He was also actively involved with local churches. In 1870 he went to Egypt to erect three sugar mills for the Khedive Ismail, which he had helped to design. In 1872 he presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers an account of the sugar factory at Aba-el-Wakf (Minutes of Proceedings, 1872‚Äì3, xxxv. 37‚Äì70), for which he received a Watt medal and a Telford premium. Anderson next turned his attention to gun mountings of the Moncrieff type, and designed several for the British government, which were made at the Erith works. In 1876 he designed twin Moncrieff turret mountings for 40-ton guns for the Russian admiralty, which were made at Erith and proved highly successful. Later he designed similar mountings for 50-ton guns for the same country, and about 1888 he designed the mountings for the battleship HMS Rupert. About 1878‚Äì82 he was occupied with large contracts which his firm had obtained for the waterworks of Antwerp and Seville. To render the waters of the river Nethe, which was little better than a sewer, available for drinking purposes, he invented, in conjunction with Sir Frederick Augustus Abel, a revolving iron purifier, which proved perfectly effectual. He contributed a paper on the Antwerp Waterworks to the Institution of Civil Engineers (Minutes of Proceedings. lxxii. 24‚Äì83), for which he received a Telford Medal and premium. About 1888 Anderson was asked by the explosives committee of the War Office to design the machinery for the manufacture of the new smokeless explosive, cordite. He had hardly commenced this task when, on 11 August 1889, he was appointed director-general of the ordnance factories. The duties of this post, mainly focused at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, prevented him from continuing his work in relation to the cordite machinery, which was committed to his eldest son. Anderson made many improvements in the details of the management of the Arsenal, and introduced greater economy into its administration. During the 1890s, Anderson's continuing interest in education led to him becoming a trustee of the newly established Woolwich Polytechnic; he was a member of its governing body in 1893, and later (1895) represented the War Department on its board of governors. He was also involved with the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. Anderson contributed numerous papers to scientific institutions, and delivered many lectures on scientific subjects. His Howard Lectures on the Conversion of Heat into Work, delivered before the Society of Arts in 1884 and 1885, were published in 1887 in the Specialist's Series. A second edition appeared in 1889. Honours He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 12 January 1869. In 1886, he was elected a member of council, and in 1896 a vice-president. He was also a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, of which he was president in 1892 and 1893. In 1889 he was president of section G at the meeting of the British Association at Newcastle, and on that occasion he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from Durham University. On 4 June 1891 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was a vice-president of the Society of Arts, a member of the Royal Institution, of the Iron and Steel Institute, and of other societies. He was also a lieutenant-colonel of the engineer and railway volunteer staff corps. In 1895 he was created CB, and in 1897 K.C.B. Private life He married Emma Eliza, daughter of J. R. Brown of Knighton, Radnorshire on 11 November 1856, and they had at least two sons and a daughter. He lived in Lesney House, in The Avenue, Erith. He died at Woolwich in 1898 and was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, Erith, where a monument was erected in his memory.personal visit His coffin was carried by Woolwich Arsenal workers and placed on a special train to Erith where workers from the Erith Iron Works carried the coffin from the train to the hearse.

As the highway reaches the north end of the city, it meets I-15 in another interchange, continuing north through Enoch as the Minersville Highway. After leaving Enoch, (at the northern end of Cedar Valley), the highway continues north through sparsely-populated areas, intersecting Gap Road, an extension of the old Lund Highway about north of Enoch. Gap Road connects to Parowan, and is named for the pass it traverses, Parowan Gap, site of ancient petroglyphs, evidence that it was on a major thoroughfare of early Native Americans. SR-130 continues in a generally north-northwest direction through the Black Mountains, entering Beaver County and arriving in Minersville, ending at its intersection with SR-21. The southernmost sections of SR-130, from the southern terminus at I-15 to 4800 North in Enoch, are part of the National Highway System. History State Route 130 was originally established in 1933 as the Minersville Loop on SR-21. In 1953, one of the legs of the loop was deleted, turning the highway into a short spur connecting SR-21 to the center of Minersville. In 1965, this short spur was significantly extended south, now passing through Minersville, and continuing all the way down through Enoch to U.S. Route 91 just north of Cedar City, bringing its total length to about . With the construction of Interstate 15 in the area, the route was extended southward again in 1967. This extension took it south through Cedar City on the former alignment of State Route 1 (US-91) along Main Street to the south Cedar City interchange, a distance of about , while State Route 1 was realigned to the west to coincide with Interstate 15.

A peace museum dedicated to the pilots, the , now marks the site. Airbase The Imperial Japanese Army airbase at Chiran, Kagoshima, with its two runways, was the principal kamikaze base during the Battle of Okinawa. Of the 1,036 army aviators who died in these attacks, 439 were from Chiran. Of the total number, 335 were classed as \\"young boy pilots\\" (Â∞ëÂπ¥È£õË°åÂÖµ). Peace Museum Ki-43 Hayabusa In 1975 a museum was built to commemorate the lives of the pilots and document their \\"patriotic efforts for peace\\". Enlarged in 1986, exhibits include four planes: a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa, a 1943 Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien, a 1944 Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate, and a Mitsubishi Zero recovered from the seabed in 1980. On a personal level, the exhibit includes letters, poems, essays, testaments, and other artefacts; as well as photographs of the 1,036 pilots, arranged in the order in which they died. There is also the grand piano on which two of the pilots played the Moonlight Sonata the night before their final mission.

The image enshrined within is a 1.8m replica statue of the Yumechigai Kannon (Â§¢ÈÅïË¶≥Èü≥ Dream-Changing Kannon), a National Treasure at H≈çry≈´-ji. The names of the kamikaze pilots are written on paper within her womb. It was erected in 1955 thanks to donations collected by Tome Torihama, who ran the Tomiya Inn frequented by the pilots, and who sought to redeem their memory after the war.

Coupled with his work on early Australian cartography, he played an influential part in re-charting Australian history prior to its settlement by the British in 1788, and noted evidence of agriculture and settlements on the continent before the arrival of settlers. Early years Rupert Gerritsen was born in Geraldton,Fremantle Press Authors \\"G\\" Fremantle Press, 2011 Western Australia in 1953, of Dutch parents. He grew up in Geraldton, where he experienced first hand the excitement of the discovery of the wreck of the Batavia in 1963 and came to know some of those involved in its discovery and the discovery of other 17th and 18th century shipwrecks on the coast of Western Australia. From 1960s through to the 1980s he was involved in radical politics and social activism.Rupert Gerritsen Obituary The Globe (Issue 74), Feb 2014 In 1972 he placed a bomb in the Perth office of the Department of Labour and National Service. The crude bomb failed to detonate. After the attempted bombing, he fled to Melbourne where he was arrested and extradited to WA. While on bail he fled to New Zealand where he was caught and was again extradited back to WA. At trial he pled guilty to placing the bomb and served a one year prison sentence.

Anthropological Linguistics 46(1):84-99. This discovery led to major reevaluation in the perceptions of the early prehistory, in that Aboriginal Australians were not mute witnesses to the unfolding events of history but active participants who embraced parts of European culture long before the British settlement of the continent. Gerritsen also researched the location where two mutineers from the Batavia mutiny, possibly Australia's first European settlers, were marooned on 16 November 1629.Playford, P.

As a consequence of his research Gerritsen established that Hutt River, north of Perth, was the site where Wouter Loos and Jan Pelgrom de Bye first set foot on mainland Australia. These discoveries wrought a complete change in the methodology of recording Western Australian pre-history. Many subsequent scholars have embraced this new historical paradigm in their works.Drake-Brockman, H. 1963 Voyage to Disaster, Sydney: Angus and Robertson, pp.295-300; Gerritsen, R, Slee, C. and Cramer, M. 2003/2005 The Batavia Legacy, Geraldton: Batavia Coast Maritime Heritage Association. After the appearance of Ghosts, Gerritsen published a range of papers and monographs in diverse fields, from archaeology to historical linguistics. Australia and the Origins of Agriculture put forward evidence that some Indigenous Australian groups in traditional circumstances were engaged in food production, including agriculture, and lived in large permanent settlements.

It is one of eight concerti in Glass' series The Concerto Project, an amalgamation of works in four volumes. Structure The piece is scored for solo piano, accompanied by string orchestra. Several recordings of the concerto have been made. The concerto is in three movements, the middle being the longest.

This is made possible by airing the series multiple times on the broadcast network which licensed it, or airing it concurrently on a cable network. As a result, the window between original run and syndication is shortened dramatically. Repurposing was the first significant adaptation of industry distribution practice since the advent of cable.Lotz (2007), pp. 124-128 Repurposing shortened the window to a matter of days between original run and syndication. Broadcast and cable developed repurposing pacts usually produced by studios also owned by broadcast networks or its conglomerate. Cable programmers hoped to increase audiences and awareness.Lotz (2007), p. 124 An early example of repurposing is the financing deal made between NBC and the United States cable channel, giving USA rights to air ‚ÄúLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit‚Äù within two weeks of its broadcast airing. Increases in license payments decreases initial risk for production companies by supplying additional revenue that helps to finance expensive projects. However, abandoning traditional conventions of exclusivity rights to a series may also lead to diminished profits due to over-saturation of the market. Nonetheless, media analysts have produced data that suggests series availability in any form of syndication negatively affects the audience size of the original run airing. Repurposing has caused concern for many industry professionals, due to the role of conglomerated ownership and deregulatory policies of eliminating Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (fin-syn). Yet ‚Äúdouble-runs‚Äù of a series on its own network has become a common practice, especially for cable networks, and is considered a significant change in the established procedures of broadcasters. Once the television and broadcasting companies adapted to cable, it was said that the practice of original run repurposing marked the first significant adjustment to distribution practices beginning in 1999. Some will argue that the role of conglomerated ownership actually caused concern as networks announced repurposing arrangements that actually favored products from commonly owned studios.Chris (2006), pp.63-64Lotz (2007), pp. 124-125 History In the late 1990s and early 2000s many mergers and acquisitions of major media companies brought about the practice of recycling programming, or better known as repurposing. Broadcast and cable networks were becoming co- owners and their interests also became interrelated. Thus, the opportunity to swap programming between the conglomerates arose. Perhaps, the first instances of repurposing can be located within cable as programmers have aired programs across co-owned stables of channels. Many digital cable programming services kept costs low by filling their schedules with almost entirely familiar material. For example, Discovery Communications has re-exploited its library of science, nature, exploration, and history programming since it launched eight digital channels in 1996‚Äì97. Likewise, A&E; Networks stocked its Biography and History International channels with previously aired A&E; and History Channel programming.Chris, Cynthia. \\"Can You Repeat That?

Finland agreed to pay the reparations in the Moscow Armistice signed on 19 September 1944. The protocol to determine more precisely the war reparations to the Soviet Union was signed in December 1944, by the prime minister Juho Kusti Paasikivi and the chairman of the Allied Control Commission for controlling the Moscow Armistice in Helsinki, Andrei Zhdanov. Finland was originally obliged to pay $300,000,000 in gold to be paid in the form of ships and machinery, over six years. The Soviet Union agreed to prolong the payment period from six to eight years in late 1945. In summer 1948 the sum was cut to $226,500,000 (equivalent to US$ in ). The last dispatched train of the deliveries paying the war reparations crossed the border between Finland and the Soviet Union on 18 September 1952, in Vainikkala railway border station. Approximately 340,000 railroad carloads were needed to deliver all reparations. The authority responsible for deliveries, and also organising production agreements with the manufacturers according to the protocols, was Sotakorvausteollisuuden valtuuskunta, the delegation of the war reparations industry. The preliminary committee was established on 9 October 1944.

Before then, pharmacy evolved from antiquity as part of medicine. The history of pharmacy coincides well with the history of medicine, but it's important that there is a distinction between the two topics. Pharmaceuticals is one of the most-researched fields in the academic industry, but the history surrounding that particular topic is sparse compared to the impact its made world-wide. Before the advent of pharmacists, there existed apothecaries that worked alongside priests and physicians in regard to patient care. Pharmacy in Rome, Italy  Prehistoric Pharmacy  Paleopharmacological studies attest to the use of medicinal plants in pre- history. For example, herbs were discovered in the Shanidar Cave, and remains of the areca nut (Areca catechu) in the Spirit Cave. Prehistoric man learned pharmaceutical techniques through instinct, by watching birds and beasts, and using cool water, leaves, dirt, or mud as a soothing agent.  Antiquity = Mesopotamia and Egypt  Sumerian cuneiform tablets record prescriptions for medicine. Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC and it included a 1,100 page document about 800 prescriptions using 700 drugs mostly derived from plants, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus of the 16th century BC. The very beginnings or pharmaceutical texts were written on clay tablets by Mesopotamians. Some texts included formulas, instructions via pulverization, infusion, boiling, filtering and spreading; herbs were mentioned as well. Babylon, a state within Mesopotamia, provided the earliest known practice of running an apothecary i.e. pharmacy. Alongside the ill person included a priest, physician, and a pharmacist to tend to their needs.  Greece  Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, Byzantium, 15th centuryIn Ancient Greece, there existed a separation between physician and herbalist. The duties of the herbalist was to supply physicians with raw materials, including plants, to make medicines. According to Edward Kremers and Glenn Sonnedecker, \\"before, during and after the time of Hippocrates there was a group of experts in medicinal plants. Probably the most important representative of these rhizotomoi was Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC). He is considered to be the source for all Greek pharmacotherapeutic treatises between the time of Theophrastus and Dioscorides.\\"Edward Kremers, Glenn Sonnedecker (1986). \\"Kremers and Urdang's History of pharmacy\\". Amer. Inst. History of Pharmacy. p.17. From 60 and 78 AD, the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides wrote a five volume book, De Materia Medica, covering over 600 plants and coining the term materia medica. It formed the basis for many medieval texts, and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age.  Asia  The earliest known Chinese manual on materia medica is the Shennong Bencao Jing (The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the Han dynasty and was attributed to the mythical Shennong. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \\"Recipes for 52 Ailments\\", found in the Mawangdui, sealed in 168 BC. Further details on Chinese pharmacy can be found in the Pharmacy in China article. The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances in Indian traditional medicine dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD )(attributed to Sushruta, who is recorded as a physician of the 6th century BC). There is a stone sign for a pharmacy with a tripod, a mortar, and a pestle opposite one for a doctor in the Arcadian Way in Ephesus, Turkey. In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538-710) and the early Nara period (710-794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih≈ç Code (701) and re-stated in the Y≈çr≈ç Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists‚Äîand even pharmacist assistants‚Äîwere assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834) Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 434.  Middle Ages = Middle East  In Baghdad the first pharmacies, or drug stores, were established in 754, under the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. By the 9th century, these pharmacies were state-regulated. Roman herbal medicine guidebook De Materia Medica of Dioscorides. Cumin & dill. c. 1334. The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarƒ´ya RƒÅzi (Rhazes) (865-915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936-1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the \\"simples\\" from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973-1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology entitled Kitab al- Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), where he gave detailed knowledge of the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, mode of action and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008‚Äì1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by \`Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis Simplicibus by \`Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250‚Äì1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The Foundations of the True Properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.Levey M. (1973), Early Arabic Pharmacology, E. J. Brill; Leiden. Illustration of a pharmacy in the Italian Tacuinum sanitatis, 14th century.  Europe  Old pharmacy in the Franciscan Monastery, Dubrovnik After the 5th century fall of the Western Roman Empire, medicinal knowledge in Europe suffered due to the loss of Greek medicinal texts and a strict adherence to tradition, although an area of Southern Italy near Salerno remained under Byzantine control and developed a hospital and medical school, which became famous by the 11th century. In the early 11th century, Salerno scholar Constantinos Africanus translated many Arabic books into Latin, driving a shift from Hippocratic medicine towards a pharmaceutical-driven approach advocated by Galen. In medieval Europe, monks typically did not speak Greek, leaving only Latin texts such as the works of Pliny available until these translations by Constantinos. In addition, Arabic medicine became more widely known due to Muslim Spain. In the 15th century, the printing press spread medicinal textbooks and formularies; the Antidotarium was the first printed drug formulary. In Europe pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century. In 1240 emperor Frederic II issued a decree by which the physician's and the apothecary's professions were separated. Old pharmacies continue to operate in Dubrovnik, Croatia located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317. The Town Hall Pharmacy in Tallinn, Estonia, which dates back to at least 1422, is the oldest continuously run pharmacy in the world still operating in the original premises.\\"Ain Raal: apteegist maakeeli.\\" Postimees 3. March 2020. The trend towards pharmacy specialization started to take effect in Bruges, Belgium where a new law was passed that forbid physicians to prepare medications for patients. The oldest pharmacy is claimed to be set up in 1221 in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, which now houses a perfume museum. The medieval Esteve Pharmacy, located in Ll√≠via, a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerd√†, is also now a museum dating back to the 15th century, keeping albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs. Florence is also the birthplace of the first official pharmacopeia, called the Nuevo Receptario, in which all pharmacies would use that document as guidance for caring for the sickly. The Republic of Venice was the first State with health modern policies which requires that the nature of the drug is public. In actuality, thirteen secrets survive which were offered to sale to the Venetian Republic.  Industrialization  The 1800s brought increased technical sophistication. By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. thumb Chloral hydrate was introduced as a sleeping aid and sedative in 1869. Chloroform was first used as an anesthetic in 1847. Derivatives of phenothiazines had an important impact on various aspects of medicine, beginning with methylene blue which was originally used as a dye after its synthesis from aniline in 1876. Phenothiazines were used as antimalarials, antiseptics, and antihelminthics up to 1940. 1950, chlorpromazine was discovered, which began the \\"psychopharmacological revolution\\". The United States formed the American Pharmaceutical Association in 1852 with its main purpose to advance pharmacists' roles in patient care, assist in furthering career development, spread information about tools and resources, and raising awareness about the roles of pharmacists and their contribution to patient care. Frederick Banting and Charles Best showed through dogs that the hormone Insulin lowered their blood sugar and started the catalyst that James B. Collip finished. Collip developed pure insulin used for human testing and dramatically changed the prospects for all diabetics. Alexander Fleming developed the first antibiotic, penicillin, after discovering a fungus that was able to kill off bacteria.

It is recognised that values may compete and change over time, and that heritage may have different meanings for different stakeholders. Origins Alois Riegl is credited with developing Ruskin's concept of 'voicefulness' into a systematic categorization of the different values of a monument. In his 1908 essay Der moderne Denkmalkultus (The modern cult of monuments) he describes historical value, artistic value, age value, commemorative value, use value, and newness value. Riegl demonstrates that some of these values conflict and argues that they may be culturally contingent. Charters and Conventions The UNESCO World Heritage Convention addresses cultural sites of outstanding universal value, from a historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological or anthropological perspective, and highlights the need for authenticity. Discussed in the 1964 Venice Charter, values and the question 'why conserve?' are the focus of the 1979 Burra Charter (last revised 1999). Cultural significance is said to be 'embodied' in the fabric, setting, use, associations, and meanings of a place, and includes aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and spiritual values for past, present and future generations. In order to preserve such values a 'cautious approach' of minimum intervention is advocated. Practice Significance assessment typically includes consideration of the rarity, representativeness, and communicative power of assets and their values. These are then managed in order to sustain and valorize that significance. Engagement with the economic value of heritage may help promote its preservation.

The film stars David Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford. Filming took place in Los Angeles, California, over seventeen days. Plot Fugitive John Taylor flees an initially unspecified crime, with a wounded foot. Flashbacks and news reports reveal he robbed a bank in collusion with his girlfriend Simone, who was a teller in the bank. He stops in a convenience store for some disinfectant, just moments before it is robbed; he manages to turn the tables on the robber, but she gets away with his wallet. The store's TV identifies John and his car, so he quickly ditches it, proceeding on foot into an expensive neighborhood. With a sob story about being mugged, he gains entry to the house of Warwick Wilson. John poses as a friend of one of Warwick's friends after he found a postcard in the mailbox outside from a woman named \\"Julia\\". Warwick is preparing a dinner party. John makes small talk and drinks red wine while trying to figure out his next move and how to keep his lies from being found out. When the radio news makes an announcement about John, he angrily shushes Warwick, revealing himself. John threatens to kill Warwick if he doesn't cooperate and forces him to call his guests to cancel. Suddenly, John keels over; the wine has been drugged, and Warwick is not the person he seems to be. When John bounces back, he finds himself tied to a chair, and the party is in full swing‚Äîbut all the guests Warwick is interacting with are figments of Warwick's imagination. Warwick takes a Polaroid of John and reveals a scrapbook of his past dinner parties, each with a murder victim and a timeline of things Warwick is going to do to him. As the night wears on, John is further terrorized, drugged, and incapacitated, learning various things about Warwick's strange lifestyle. A neighbour of Warwick, a prying old lady (whom John also tried to trick into letting him into her house earlier) hears John moaning and goes over to investigate. Warwick is able to trick her into leaving, blaming a drunk dinner guest for the noise. Warwick cauterizes John's wound with the fire poker after the neighbor leaves. John also discovers that Julia is yet another figment of Warwick's imagination when he sees Warwick writing a postcard to himself from Julia. Later, John and Warwick play chess, with the prize being John's freedom; John, who is an excellent player, wins. Warwick lets John go as agreed, but taunts him before he can leave, calling him worthless and secondary. John takes the tant≈ç (Japanese sword) on display in Warwick's living room and stabs him with it, but it proves to be a collapsible prop knife, and so Warwick knocks John out. When he once more regains consciousness, they are in Warwick's bathroom, John tied up in the tub, while Warwick has an encounter. In the daylight, he places a picture in his scrapbook in which he seemingly slit John's throat. John's body is left outside with the trash. He wakes up and discovers that most of his injuries are fake; Warwick is a master of movie makeup. L.A.P.D. Detective Morton arrives at Warwick's door ‚Äì Warwick is actually a police lieutenant, who is working on John's robbery. Warwick hides the scrapbook, medicine and kimono, then alters his demeanor and even his voice. Meanwhile, John becomes suspicious of girlfriend Simone and discovers she made alternative travel arrangements out of Los Angeles that don't include him. Warwick and Detective Morton join another detective who are watching Simone's apartment. John locates Simone in a parking garage, taking her switch car and the money, leaving her to be captured by the detectives. Warwick stops John from leaving and blackmails him for the money, leaving him about $20,000 to get past the Mexican border, for which John says thank you. A couple of months later, Detective Morton receives a letter from Mexico ‚Äì it's a Polaroid of Warwick and John together, from the dinner party, with a written warning. A suspicious Morton confronts Warwick, who blows it off; but, when Morton persists, Warwick invites Morton to a dinner party and asks what type of wine he would like. Warwick then walks out of the office - along with his imaginary friends, who are dressed as police officers - with a smirk on his face.

Origins The method was originally developed by Tom Malzbender of HP Labs in order to generate enhanced 3D computer graphics and it has since been adopted for cultural heritage applications. Methodology A series of images is captured in a darkened room with the camera in a fixed position and the object lit from different angles. These images are then processed and combined to enable a virtual light source to be controlled by the user inspecting the object. The virtual light source may be manipulated to simulate light from different angles and of different intensity or wavelengths to illuminate the surface of artefacts and reveal details. Open source tools for processing the captured images and publishing the resulting relightable images on the web are freely available. Applications Polynomial texture mapping may be used for detailed recording and documentation, 3D modelling, edge detection, and to aid the study of inscriptions and other artefacts. It has been applied to hundreds of the Vindolanda tablets by the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents at the University of Oxford in conjunction with the British Museum. It has also been deployed, by Ben Altshuler of the Institute for Digital Archaeology, to scan the Philae obelisk at Kingston Lacy, and the Parian Chronicle at the Ashmolean Museum; in both cases scans revealed significant, previously illegible text. A 'dome' supporting twenty-four lights has been used to image paintings in the National Gallery and produce polynomial texture maps, providing information on condition phenomena for conservation purposes. Studies of the technique at the National Gallery and Tate concluded that it is an effective tool for documenting changes in the condition of paintings, more easily repeatable than raking light photography, and therefore could be used to assess paintings during structural treatment and before and after loan. Twelve dome-based systems built by the University of Southampton have been used to capture thousands of cuneiform tablets at various museums The technique is now also finding uses in the field of forensic science, for example in imaging footprints, tyre marks and indented writing.

Raking light, the illumination of objects from a light source at an oblique angle or almost parallel to the surface, provides information on the surface topography and relief of the artefact thus lit. It is widely used in the examination of works of art. Examination of paintings Using raking light, the effects of impasto and the surface texture of a painting are accentuated by the increased illumination of surfaces facing the light source and the exaggeration of shadows on surfaces facing away from the light source. In some instances raking light may help reveal pentimenti (changes in an artist's intention). In the case of wall paintings, raking light helps show preparatory techniques such as incisions in the plaster support. Conservation Conservators examine objects under raking light during visual inspection and for condition recording. In the examination of easel paintings, raking light may help document craquelure, paint cupping, uneven tension in a canvas, or warp in a panel. In the examination of wall paintings, raking light can help document surface deterioration phenomena such as the efflorescence of salts and micro- delamination, and may be used for monitoring the effects of conservation interventions.

They viewed these musical styles as inferior works belonging to an allegedly \\"inferior\\" race and therefore prohibited by the Nazis. The term, at that same time, was also applied to indigenous music styles of black Africans.  Nazi Germany  Poster of Jonny spielt auf At the time of the Weimar Republic during 1927, Ernst Krenek's opera of Jonny spielt auf (Jonny Plays) contained jazz musical performances that caused protests among some right-wing ethnic-nationalist groups in Germany at the time. In 1930, the American musician Henry Cowell wrote in the Melos journal that jazz interpreted a mixture of African-American and Jewish elements, stating that: > The fundamentals of jazz are the syncopation and rhythmic accents of the > Negro. Their modernization is the work of New York Jews ... So jazz is Negro > music seen through the eyes of the Jews. Wilhelm Frick in his cell, November 1945. He was hanged for his crimes at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 Such views were readily picked up by the Nazis. Their criticisms have included \\"gratuitous use of syncopation\\" and \\"orgies of drums\\". More statements from the Nazis included such things as \\"artistic licentiousness\\" and \\"corruption seed in the musical expression\\" with \\"indecent dance forms\\". They went on to scrutinize all modern music of the 1930s as a \\"political weapon of the Jews\\". On 4 May 1930, Wilhelm Frick, the Reich's newly appointed Minister of the Interior and Education for Thuringia made a decree called \\"Against the Negro Culture ‚Äì For Our German Heritage\\". In 1932 the national government under Franz von Papen pandered to the Nazis by banning all public performances by black musicians. After Adolf Hitler gained power in 1933, the Reich's Music Chamber was also created in that same year. This was then followed by a full legal ban on this music on October 12, 1935 across all German national radio. This ban was spearheaded by the German Reich's radio conductor, Eugen Hadamovsky, who purportedly stated: > Mit dem heutigen Tag spreche ich ein endg√ºltiges Verbot des Negerjazz f√ºr > den gesamten Deutschen Rundfunk aus. (As of today, I decree a definitive ban > on the negro jazz for the entire German Radio.). In 1938, the Nazis organized the (Degenerate music) public exhibition in Germany, mainly held in D√ºsseldorf. This exhibition included a poster displaying a cartoon caricature of an African-American male playing on a saxophone with the Star of David on his tuxedo lapel. The overall theme of the exhibition was defamation of contemporary American music as \\"Negro music\\" and as another Jewish 'plot' upon German culture.  Swing kids  The \\"Swing Kids\\" (German: Swingjugend) were a group of jazz and swing lovers in Germany in the 1930s, mainly in Hamburg (St. Pauli) and Berlin. They were mainly composed of 14- to 18-year-old boys and girls. They defied National Socialism (Nazism) by listening and dancing to this same banned music in private quarters, clubs, rented halls and vacant caf√©s. German jazz was offensive to Nazi ideology, because it was often performed by blacks and a number of Jewish musicians. The Swing Kids gave the impression of being apolitical, similar to their zoot suiter counterparts in North America. On 18 August 1941, in a brutal police operation, over 300 Swing kids were arrested. The measures against them ranged from cutting their hair and sending them back to school under close monitoring, to the deportation of their leaders to Nazi concentration camps. The 1993 movie Swing Kids gives a fictional portrayal of these same youths in that period in Germany.  World War II  Prior to the D-Day landings, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, Joseph Goebbels's propaganda ministry published pamphlets written in Dutch named \\"Greetings from England ‚Äì The Coming Invasion\\". These pamphlets contained in- between statements, such as \\"old jazz-records\\" and a further full statement declaring \\"at the celebration of liberation your daughters and wives will be dancing in the arms of real Negroes\\". This further equated jazz music with 'blackness' during this time to stir up racism and anti-Allied propaganda within occupied Europe. However, Goebbels managed to create a Nazi-sponsored German swing band named Charlie and his Orchestra whose propagandistic purpose was to win over Nazi support and sympathy from British and American listeners through shortwave radio. Additionally counter-propaganda was used by Allied forces which played upon the fears of the Nazi's banned music. One such example is Glenn Miller, who was a White American jazz musician, that initially provided jazz music, through radio, to Allied combat soldiers for the purposes of entertainment and morale. His same music was used as counter- propaganda by AFN radio broadcasting to denounce fascist oppression in Europe with even Miller once stating himself: \\"America means freedom, and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music.\\"  Post-War period  Even in the post‚ÄìWorld War II years in 1950s Germany, there were some protests from churches, school authorities and politicians against the \\"obscene Negro music\\" of the newly emerging rock 'n' roll genre with such acts like Elvis and Chuck Berry gaining new popularity amongst youth. (Millions of Elvis-fans cannot be wrong) Retrieved 19 September 2011 This attitude also continued right up into the 1960s carrying the same derogatory term that not only maintained its resentment by older generations and conservatives but also was an aggressive defense against a then new contemporary American culture.

Hamont, who came from Hethersett, was a Unitarian. The Bishop of Norwich, Edmund Freke, accused Hamont of denying Christ to be a Saviour.Mathew Carey Letters on religious persecution 1829 \\"Matthew Hamont, of Hetharset, three miles from Norwich, was \\"convicted before the Bishop of Norwich, for that he denied Christ to be our Saviour.\\" On 19 May 1579 his ears were cut off and the following day, 20 May 1579, he was burned to death at Norwich Castle. Life In the Hethersett parish registers the surname is spelt Hamonte, Hammonte, and Hammante. According to Alexander Gordon, he was probably of Dutch origin. Early in 1579 he was cited before Edmund Freke on a charge of denying Christ. The articles exhibited against him represented him as a coarse kind of deist, holding the Gospel to be a fable, Christ a sinner, and the Holy Ghost a nonentity. William Burton stated of his beliefs: > I haue knovven some Arrian heretiques, whose life hath beene most strict > amongest men, whose tongues haue beene tyred with scripture upon scripture, > their knees euen hardned in prayer, and their faces wedded to sadnesse, and > their mouthes full of praises to God, while in the meane time they haue > stowtly denied the diuinitie of the Sonne of God, and haue not sticked to > teare out of the Bible all such places as made against them; such were > Hamond, Lewes, and Cole, heretikes of wretched memorie, lately executed and > cut off in Norwich. Other authorities also describe Hamont as an Arian. He was condemned in the consistory court on 13 April, and handed over to the custody of the sheriff of Norwich. His offences were aggravated by a further charge of 'blasphemous words' against the Queen and council, for which he was sentenced to lose his ears, and for his heresy to be burned alive. On 20 May 1579 his ears were cut off in the Norwich market-place, and he was burned in the castle moat. Hamont left a widow, who died in 1625; he had a son Erasmus. John Lewes, mentioned above, was burned at Norwich on 18 September 1583; Peter Cole, a tanner of Ipswich, met the same fate at Norwich in 1587. Legacy More than a century later the case was taken up by Philip van Limborch who corresponded on the subject in 1699 with John Locke. In a BBC special, A Brief History of Disbelief, Jonathan Miller quoted Hammond's beliefs‚Äîfor which he was tortured and killed: > Christ is not God, not the saviour of the world, but a mere man, a sinful > man and an abominable idol. All who worship him are abominable idolaters and > Christ did not rise again from death to life nor did he ascend into heaven.

In the present day, the majority of them live in Jaipur, India. Etymology The surname Purswani is derived from the name of their ancestor Pursumal, son of Nebhraj Jethmal Bhambrai; the family can be traced back seven generations. The Purswani family falls under the Bhambrai Bradri Nukh Dandi Proll. The words ‚ÄúDandi Proll‚Äù are derived from Dandakaranya. History=From Lahore to Aror  The ancestors of the families of Bhambrai Bradri were Lohana, as part of Sindhi Hindu community. Around 1200 BC, this group migrated from Luvana (near modern Lahore) together with some of Shavi Aryas Diwan Bherumal Meharchand. Sindh Je Hindun Jee Tareekh-1919 to Aror (present day Sukkur), in Sindh. They settled near the banks of the Sindhu River and lived there till 962 AD.Diwan Bherumal Meharchand. Sindh Je Hindun Jee Tareekh-1919 From Vedic times till 710 AD, all residents of Sindh were Hindus and Sindh was ruled by the Hindus.Diwan Bherumal Meharchand. Sindh Je Hindun Jee Tareekh-1919 In the year 711, Hujjaj Bin Yusif, the Umayyad Governor of Iraq (appointed by Khalifa Walid) sent the Arab forces under Muhammad Bin Qasim to conquer Sindh, in the process of freeing the kidnapped women whose abduction allegation were cast on Bawarij. The first town he attacked was Debal, and upon the orders of Al-Hajjaj he looted its residents or priests and destroyed its temple . He then settled a garrison of four thousand colonists in one quarter of Debal, building a mosque over the remains of the original temple. From Debal, Muhammad Bin Qasim attacked Nayrun Kot (present day Hyderabad) and the locals, equipped mostly with farming implements, surrendered. King Nayrun was dethroned. The army of Muhammad Bin Qasim looted the trade goods and took over the Hindu worship sites atop the Ganjo Takker ridge, building mosques to replace them. The Nayrun Kot was destroyed. After that, he captured Sadusan (Sehwan). Again, the main temples were razed and mosques were built to replace them, often using their components; additionally one-fifth of the booty including slaves was dispatched to Hajjaj and the Caliph. At Ar-rur (Nawabshah), he defeated Raja Dahir's forces and the eastern [Jats] in the battle. About 6000 Sindhi warriors were put to death. Dahir's wife Ladi committed suttee to escape from the hands of the Muslims. Aror was the capital of Sindh which was ruled by Raja Dahir. Muhammad bin Qasim won over Raja Dahir and took control of Sindh. His conquest for the Umayyads brought Sindh into the orbit of the Muslim world. From Qasim on, extracting jizya (a tax on non-Muslims) was a political and religious duty exacted \\"with vigour and punctuality, and frequently with insult. The native population had to feed every Muslim traveller for three days and nights and had to submit too many other humiliations which are mentioned by Muslim historians.\\" The period of Qasim's rule has been called by U.T. Thakkur \\"the darkest period in Sindh history\\", with the records speaking of massive forced conversions, temple destruction, massacres and genocides. Khudabadi Sonara and some other Hindu Sindhis who refused to convert to Islam yet remained in Sindh were heavily oppressed. According to Sindhi legend, the Sonaras gathered at temple of the goddess Durga for three days and nights continuously without eating food and drinking water. On fourth day, a miracle occurred: all the men present felt janau (sacred thread) on their bodies and they realised the blessings of Durga Mata. Thereafter, these Khudabadi Sonara became known as Janjogal (janau- wearing) Sonara. These Hindus continued to fight the naibs of the Khalifa and in due course of time they managed to recover a large part of Sindh and ruled over that.Puj Khudabadi Sonara Panchayat (Regd.), Jaipur-Diamond Jubilee Souvenir 2005. From Aror to Bhambore In 962 AD, an earthquake struck Sindh, altering the course of the Indus. The ancestors of the families of Bhambrai Bradri shifted their homes from Aror to Bhambore (Bhambore is famously known as Bhambra among Khudabadi Sindhi Swarankar Community). During the ensuing prolonged period of lasting peace after 711 AD when, the families of Bhambrai Bradri as a part of Sindhi Lohana/Khudabadi Sonara could not be supported by the armies and could not find any work as warriors, they turned to peacetime occupations and became cloth merchants as the means of their livelihood in Bhambore. About the 10th century Bhambore was the capital of a chief Bhambo Raja and was named Bhambore after him. Bhambore was the ruins of the ancient port city of Debal, located near modern Karachi at the base of the Indus River, approximately 60 km between Dhabeji and Gharo. Its population was mainly Hindus with a Buddhist minority. It is largely known for the ruins of a castle destroyed by Muhammad bin Qasim during the invasion of Sindh. According to modern archaeologists Debal was founded in the 1st century AD, and soon became the most important trading city in Sindh. The city was home to thousands of Sindhi Sailors including the Bawarij (a Muslim Sindhi community). Ibn Hawqal mentions the dry arid land surrounding the city that supported little agriculture, he mentions how efficiently the inhabitants of the city maintained fishing vessels and trade. Bhambore was the trading link between Arab and South Asian nations of its times. It was most important fort because of trade communication and security. According to Berzin, Umayyad interest in the region stemmed from their desire to control the trade route down the Indus River valley to the seaports of Sindh, an important link in the ancient Silk Road. At that time, Sindh was the wild frontier region ruled by Raja Dahir who also wanted to control the Western Indian Ocean. Muslim sources insist that it was these persistent activities along increasingly important Indian trade routes by Debal pirates (Bawarij) and others which forced the Arabs to subjugate the area, in order to control the seaports and maritime routes of which Sindh was the nucleus, as well as, the overland passage. In 711 AD Muhammad Bin Qasim entered Sindh by first assaulting and capturing Debal Fort, presently known as Bhambore. Debal and the Manora Island were visited by Ottoman Admiral Sevdi Ali Reis and mentioned in his book Mir√°t ul Memalik in 1554. In 1568, Debal was attacked by the Portuguese Admiral Fernao Mendes Pinto in an attempt to capture or destroy the Ottoman vessels anchored there. Fernao Mendes Pinto also claims that Sindhi sailors joined the Ottoman admiral Kurtoglu Hizir Reis on his voyage to Aceh. Debal was also visited by the British travel writers such as Thomas Postans and Eliot, who is noted for his vivid account on the city of Thatta. From Bhambore (Bhambra) to Lakhpat (Kutch) Members of Bhambrai Bradri (the ancestors of Purswani family) also left Bhambore and settled in Lakhpat around 1200 AD and continued with their occupation as cloth merchants. This is said to be due to the invasions of Mahmoud Ghaznavi. From Lakhpat (Kutch) to Bhambore (Bhambra) and Khudabad The Sammas, a Rajput tribes, which was ruling Kutch, gained control of Thatta in the southern Sindh from the Soomras around 1351, and expanded their territory northward to Bhakkar and beyond. Around that time, the Khudabadi Sonara Community started returning to their home towns (Bhambore, Tando & Nayrun Kot etc.), and some of them settled on a \\"empty land\\" on the banks of Sindhu River near Dadu, in Sindh. Members of Khudabadi Sonara Community developed the empty land and called it \\"Khud-Abad\\" Later, due to Muslim domination, the Khud-Abad was renamed as Khudabad, a Muslim name. Families of Bhambrai Bradri (the ancestors of Purswani Family) returned to their home town Bhambore around 1400 AD. They are called Bhambrai Bradri because they lived in Bhambore for many centuries (before migration to Lakhpat around 1200 AD and after returning from Lakhpat). Bhambore was later abandoned due to a change in the river's course. Evidence of earthquakes and regional invaders is also cited as an explanation for the population's movement away from the area and the crumbling of the castle. The former river delta is now a creek. And later, they shifted to Khudabad around 1700 AD. They changed their business from cloth merchants to jewelry and goldsmith business while living in Khudabad.Puj Khudabadi Sonara Panchayat (Regd.), Jaipur-Diamond Jubilee Souvenir 2005. Khudabadi Sonara invented Khudabadi Script for Sindhi Language around 1750 AD while living in Khudabad. It is called Khudabadi Script because it was invented in Khudabad. It was later known as Vaniki, Hatvaniki and Hatkai. Mian Noor Mohammad Kalhoro, who became the ruler of Sindh (1720‚Äì1755), then, chose Khudabad as his capital. The Khudabad was capital of Sindh between 1720 and 1783. From Khudabad to Hyderabad (Sindh) After the defeat of Kalhoras (Mian Abdul Nabi Kalhora), and extensive flooding of the River Sindh, Mir Fateh Ali Khan (Talpur) left his capital Khudabad and made Hyderabad his capital in 1789. Great celebrations were held in 1792 to mark his formal entry in Hyderabad fort. He made the Pako Qilo his residence, which was spread over thirty-six acres, and he held his courts there. The change of capital induced a large number of the population of Khudabad to migrate to Hyderabad, the new seat of royalty. The families of Bhambrai Bradri along with the other families of the Sonara community, Amils and Bhaibands, who had lived and worked in Khudabad, shifted to Hyderabad with the rulers, They retained the term Khudabadi in the names of their communities as an identifier of their origin and called themselves \\"Khudabadi Sonaras\\", \\"Khudabadi Amils\\" and \\"Khudabadi Bhaibands\\". The Bhambrai Bradri lived in Gidwani Ghitti(ghitti means lane) in Hyderabad.Puj Khudabadi Sonara Panchayat (Regd.), Jaipur-Diamond Jubilee Souvenir 2005. At that time, the head of Bhambrai Bradri was Paripyomal Bhambrai, also known as \\"Bhai Sitaldas Bhambrai\\". He had a son, Jethmal Bhambrai, who was born around 1789 in Khudabad before they moved to Hyderabad.Khudabadi Sonara Navjawan Mandal Samiti (Regd.), Jaipur-Diamond Jubilee Souvenir, April 22, 2011. Jethmal Bhambrai had friendly relations with Diwan Tarachand Sagharani, then Mukhi of Amil Panchayat in Hyderabad. The Battle of Miani ended on 24 March 1843, where the last Talpur rulers, Mir Mohammad Naseers Khan Talpur of Hyderabad and Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur of Mirpur lost to the British General Sir Charles James Napier and the cities of Hyderabad and Mirpur came into the hands of the British East India Company. Mukhi Tarachand Sagharani and other residents of Hyderabad feared reprisal and apprehended lootings from the hands of the British forces. Sagharani, along with Mukhi Chandumal of the Khudabadi Sonara, Jethmal Bhambrai (the ancestor of Purswani Family), and three other elders of Hyderabad City met Napier and pleaded with him to confine his forces to barracks and not to allow them to enter the city. The residents of Hyderabad undertook to provide them with food and other rations that the British forces needed and deliver it to them in their camp. Sir Charles conceded to their request, and the British forces remained outside the city. The residents of Hyderabad provided the rations and Amil Panchayat footed the bill. Later, Sir Charles Napier met Mukhi Tarachand Sagharani and others in his camp at Gidu Bunder and thanked them for their farsightedness, and for the food that they had supplied. This information was disclosed to Diwan Bherumal Meharchand Advani by Mukhi Mangharam Gurdinomal and was on records in the India Office, London. Diwan Bherumal Meharchand Advani further writes that it was learnt from records maintained by Pinda Badaldas Bulchand of Sindhi Dharamshala Haridwar, that wife of Amil Mukhi Tarachand Sagharani expired in the year 1835 and Mukhi Assanand along with Jethmal Bhambrai served as kandhi [pallbearer](Kandhi words relates to kandh meaning area between neck & shoulder on which kandhi supports the \\"Kaai\\") , for his wife, carrying her ashes for performing the last rites at Haridwar. At that time Kumbh Mela was in progress.Diwan Bherumal Meharchand. Sindh Je Hindun Jee Tareekh-1919 Surname change Jethmal Bhambrai had two sons, naming Nebhraj (born around 1814 AD) and Aainomal. Nebhraj had four sons naming Pursumal, Motoomal, Hassrajmal and Assandas whereas, Aainomal had one son naming Mangatram. Respected Mangatram had two sons naming Gunomal and Udhanmal. The surname of whole family was Jethmalani. Around the year 1910, the descendants of Pursumal changed their surname to Purswani, those of Motoomal changed to Motwani, those of Hassrajmal changed to Hasrajani, those of Gunomal changed to Ganvani and those of Udhanmal changed to Udhani. Assandas had a daughter named chupi but no son as such there was no further extension of the family of Assandas. All these groups have been maintaining their respective surnames since then. At the same time, all the families have also retained ‚ÄúBhambrai‚Äù as the name of their Bradri, signifying that their ancestors had lived in Bhambore many centuries ago. Pursumal had four sons (Lalchand, Narumal, Jeumal, Fatumal and Bhojraj). In the year 1910, there were further splits in families; the descendants of Purswani family such as Lalchand, Narumal, Fatumal separated whereas Jeumal and Bhojraj remained together (the wives of Jeumal and Bhojraj were sisters). By this time, the members of Motwani family and Hasrajani family moved out from the joint residence in Gidwani Ghitti but the members of Purswani family continued to occupy the ancestor¬¥s residence in Gidhwani Ghitti. Most of the male members of these families continued with their ancestor‚Äôs occupation (goldsmithing) in Hyderabad, but before Partition of Sub-continent at least one person from each home of the family was working overseas. The members of one or two families went for higher education. Some of them became medical practitioners and teachers whereas some went into government services but most of them now, have gone back to their original occupation as Textile Merchants equipped with modern technology.Khudabadi Sonara Navjawan Mandal Samiti (Regd.), Jaipur- Diamond Jubilee Souvenir, April 22, 2011. In the past, some members of Purswani Family were practicing Bhakti Yoga and some were involved in community work whereas, some took part in Indian Freedom Movement and Indian National Army.Puj Khudabadi Sonara Panchayat (Regd.), Jaipur-Diamond Jubilee Souvenir 2005.

(February‚ÄìMarch 1944.) Kurt M√§lzer (2 August 1894 in Altenburg ‚Äì 24 March 1952 in Werl) was a German general of the Luftwaffe and a war criminal during World War II. In 1943, M√§lzer was appointed the military commander of the city of Rome, subordinated to General Eberhard von Mackensen under the overall command of Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. Under his authority, M√§lzer commanded not only the garrison Wehrmacht troops in Rome itself, but also indirectly the SS security forces in the city (although these troops were nominally under the authority of the SS and Police Leader of the region, Wilhelm Harster). M√§lzer was one of the German commanders in Rome directly responsible for the Ardeatine massacre in March 1944. M√§lzer ordered the massacre which was then planned and carried out by the SS troops. After the war, M√§lzer was put on trial by the Allies and sentenced to death, later commuted to a prison term. He died in prison in 1952. Early career Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, M√§lzer joined the Prussian Army as a Cadet. He served on the Western Front for the duration of the war, receiving both classes of the Iron Cross. In 1918, he completed pilot training; however the war ended before M√§lzer could be assigned to an active squadron. As a Leutnant, M√§lzer remained in the peacetime Reichswehr and was assigned as a Platoon Officer in the 4th Automotive Department. Between 1923 and 1924, he trained as an artillery officer, was promoted to Oberleutnant in 1925, and assigned as a battery commander in the 4th Artillery Regiment. In 1928, he was assigned to extended educational duties and studied at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg. In 1933, M√§lzer received a certificate as graduate engineer (today's equivalent to a Master's degree) and was thereafter assigned to the German Ministry of Defense. By 1935, he had risen to the rank of Major. With the founding of the Luftwaffe, M√§lzer transferred into the German Air Force, first assigned to a Flight Technical School, later becoming a flight instructor at the Air Technical Academy in Berlin-Gatow. In 1937, he was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) and assigned to command the 255th Combat Wing stationed at Landsberg am Lech. World War II Promoted to Oberst (Colonel) in 1939, upon the outbreak of World War II M√§lzer was assigned as a staff officer of Luftflotte 2. After serving in Poland and France, he was posted as the Air District Commander of Brussels on 28 May 1940. Promoted to Generalmajor in 1941, he became a Department Head in the German Ministry of Aviation until September 1943 when he transferred to command Flugbereitschaft 17 in Vienna. On 1 October 1943 he was promoted to Generalleutnant and ordered to become garrison commander and commandant of the occupied city of Rome. Military Commander of Rome M√§lzer had become military commander of Rome on 30 October 1943. In 1944 he became involved in the Ardeatine massacre. Since Rome had become a city close to the front, the power to decide about retaliatory measures after partisan attacks lay with the commanders of the Wehrmacht, i.e. M√§lzer, Eberhard von Mackensen and Albert Kesselring. In that respect Herbert Kappler, head of the SD in Rome, was M√§lzer's subordinate. Shortly after the bombing of the German SS Police Regiment 'Bozen' on 23 March 1944, an apparently intoxicated M√§lzer appeared at the scene of the crime and ordered to blow up the blocks of houses at the Via Rasella immediately. He also threatened to have all the people who had been arrested at the Via Rasella to be shot. It was Kappler who later claimed to have talked M√§lzer out of his plan. Instead M√§lzer proceeded to inform Kesselring. The chain of command which led to the following massacre of 335 Italian civilians, political prisoners and Jews on 24 March 1944 is not entirely clear. In their respective trials after the war M√§lzer, Mackensen and Kesselring claimed that they acted under direct order from Adolf Hitler, and that the shooting of 330 Italians already sentenced to death was to be planned and carried out by the SD under Kappler. Historian Joachim Staron questions the existence of a ‚Ä≥F√ºhrer's order\\", since neither general mentioned such an order during interrogations before their trials. On the witness stand Kappler argued that he had received orders by Kesselring, and suggested that at least M√§lzer knew that the Germans did not have 330 prisoners under the sentence of death. On 30 November 1946 M√§lzer and Mackensen were sentenced to death by a British military court at the university of Rome. After Kesselring had been sentenced to death on 6 May 1947, his sentence as well as M√§lzer's and Mackensen's were commuted to life imprisonment shortly thereafter. M√§lzer died in Werl prison in March 1952. Kurt M√§lzer is a main character in the film Massacre in Rome, and is portrayed by actor Leo McKern.

History The piece was written in 1938 and then revised in 1945, including the replacement of the third movement. This was Britten's first work for piano and orchestra, which he premiered as the soloist at a Promenade Concert in 1938. Dedicated to the composer Lennox Berkeley, the concerto is a bravura work that has gained more international attention in recent years. Boosey and Hawkes website, cc 2012 Boosey and Hawkes, an Imagem company. Britten described the piece as \\"simple and in direct form\\". Music Web International, Michael Cookson. The revised version premiered at the Cheltenham Festival on July 2, 1946. The London premiere was performed soon after at the Proms in Royal Albert Hall with Noel Mewton-Wood as the soloist performing with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Basil Cameron. With Britten's agreement, a theme from the revised version was used by his colleague William Walton as the basis of a 1969 orchestral work, Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten.Burton, Anthony (2015). Notes to Chandos CD CHSA 5153 The best-known recording of the concerto is by the English Chamber Orchestra with Sviatoslav Richter as the soloist and Britten conducting, from a 1970 performance at the Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh, near Britten's own home. Boosey & Hawkes published the score of the concerto and estimated that it is 33 minutes in length. Instrumentation The work is scored for 2 flutes (both doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (II doubling English horn), 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, timpani, glockenspiel, cymbals, whip, bass drum, snare drum, tambourine, tenor drum, harp, and strings. Form The concerto is in four movements: 1\\\\. Toccata: Allegro molto e con brio - . The first is the most typically 'bravura' movement of the concerto. Much of the melody is derived from a sequence introduced in the opening bars. As in the rest of the piece, the orchestra plays a major role. There is a significant cadenza, written with no clear time signature and only approximate bar lines, where glissandos are a key feature. A lyrical melody opens up, before rapidly building to a dramatic end. https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Benjamin-Britten-Piano-Concerto-revised- version/15471 2\\\\. Waltz: Allegretto - 3\\\\. Impromptu: Andante lento - . Originally the third movement was a 'Recitative and Aria'. There is another section marked 'quasi cadenza', again written with ambiguous bar markings. 4\\\\. March: Allegro moderato sempre a la marcia - . Dotted rhythms and crushed notes are an important feature of this movement, and a whip-crack is heard throughout, as is musical quotation of the first movement. The music is much denser than the other movements. https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Benjamin- Britten-Piano-Concerto-revised-version/15471 Selected recordings The pianist Sviatoslav Richter, a friend of Britten's, recorded the work with Britten conducting the English Chamber Orchestra.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfoaJ9ILg5Y Stephan Osbourne has recorded the work with Illan Volkov and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, and the concerto has been performed several times at the BBC Proms by the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes. https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/er84mb References Category:Concertos by Benjamin Britten Britten Category:1938 compositions Category:1945 compositions ","title":"Piano Concerto (Britten)"},{"id":"31614764","text":"Anton Yuryev is a Russian American scientist.

On 26 April 2010, one was painted over by council contractors, leading to local and international coverage and debate on the nature of street art and its preservation, and new measures for its protection. Another was accidentally destroyed in May 2012 by building work. , there was one still remaining. Concept Parachuting Rat was a purple rat with aviator glasses descending by parachute. Banksy's oeuvre is largely directed towards anti- capitalist and anti-war themes, and this piece was painted in 2003. Banksy's work is described as distinctive in style, satirical, and provocative. Banksy himself has written, in connection with his works involving rats, 'they exist without permission. They are hated, hunted and persecuted ‚Ä¶ if you are dirty, insignificant and unloved then rats are the ultimate role model'; that 'you can win the rat race but you're still a rat'; and also that he had been painting rats for three years before someone told him that the word is an anagram of art. Medium Parachuting Rat was executed using stencils and spray paint. While earlier in his career Banksy painted freehand, in his later work from the mid-noughties he adopted the use of stencils in order to accelerate the creative process and reduce the likelihood of being caught. His works generally appear anonymously and overnight. Banksy has written that 'graffiti‚Ä¶is the most honest artform available. There is no elitism or hype ‚Ä¶ nobody is put off by the price of admission. A wall has always been the best place to publish your work'. Context Melbourne is recognised as the street art capital of Australia. Banksy, who spent a few months in the city earlier in his career, described the city's street art as 'arguably Australia's most significant contribution to the arts since they stole all the Aborigines' pencils'. Parachuting Rat is one of a number of works he executed in the city in 2003. Parachuting Rat adorned the wall above a doorway of a council building behind the Forum Theatre in Hosier Lane, a tourist attraction which attracts up to a thousand people a day because of its street art. While Hosier Lane had at the time five approved areas for street art, Parachuting Rat was not in one of these. It was allowed to remain 'by exception' because the council was aware of the popularity of Banksy's works. Removal While Melbourne has a policy of encouraging street art, it also has a problem with gangs tagging walls and public property. Melbourne's deputy Lord Mayor Susan Riley sent cleaners to Hosier Lane after residents complained about squalid conditions in the alley. The cleaners were instructed to tidy up the rat- infested garbage and remove all graffiti from unapproved street art sites. Leaving alone the approved sites, the cleaners painted over Parachuting Rat, by then thought to be the only remaining work by Banksy on public view in the city, with a thick layer of battleship-grey paint. Challenged at the time by a local resident, the cleaners replied 'we are just doing what we're told'. Another was destroyed in May 2012 by builders working on plumbing. The building owner, who knows Banksy through a New York contact, said that he laughed at the fact that \\"TV Cameras took an interest in his work\\" in an email she sent them about the incident. Reaction=Melbourne Council Robert Doyle, Lord Mayor of Melbourne, who had recently posed for a publicity photo before Hosier Lane's street art, praised such art as 'legitimate expression of artistic intent', although he also said Parachuting Rat 'was not the Mona Lisa' and declared it an 'honest mistake' by the cleaners. Melbourne City Council CEO Kathy Alexander said it was not an error on the part of the cleaners since they had been instructed to clean all unapproved areas, and had not been informed of its cultural significance. She also highlighted that there was no legal permit for the Parachuting Rat, and acknowledged that the council should have acted sooner to approve and protect all known Banksy works. The council subsequently discussed whether it should invite artists to restore their damaged works and announced that it would issue retrospective legal permits to ensure other famous and significant works of street art are protected. The difficulty of protecting street art was also acknowledged. The council had previously attempted to protect 'Diving Bell' by Banksy by erecting a perspex sheet; its vandalism in 2008 was linked to discontent within the street art community over bureaucratic interference. Art world Parachuting Rat was potentially worth tens of thousands of pounds. An ABC debate suggested that street art is by nature ephemeral; that it should not be heritage-listed and protected with glass; that in restoring a painting you see not the artist's work but a representation of that work; and also raised the questions of ownership, public art, finance, and the egalitarianism of the selective preservation of works of art. Within a few days ten replacement parachute rats, in fluorescent shades of pink, blue, green and purple were created in Hosier Lane using stencils, along with another rat in the lifts of 121 Exhibition Street, the offices of the Department of Justice. An anonymous expert in Banksy and Melbourne's street art observed 'I think [Banksy] delights in placing authorities and councils in this funny position of trying to preserve his work because it's worth so much money now'. He also claimed that there were a number of other works by Banksy in the city and argued that the locations should remain undisclosed in order to protect them from destruction. Later in 2010 an image of a rat stolen from an electricity meter box outside the home of a well-known underwear designer was claimed to be by Banksy; the authenticity of this work was questioned, with some calling it a fake.

It has been described as a form of soft power, \\"the ability to indirectly influence behaviour or interests through cultural or ideological means\\".Nagata, Kazuaki, Exporting culture via 'Cool Japan', The Japan Times, 15 May 2012, p. 3 Origins Following the destruction of World War II after American bombings, Japan aimed to improve both the nation's economy and its national image through the distribution of Japanese pop culture on an international scale, specifically throughout Eastern Asia, in order to improve their reputation and strengthen alliances with neighboring countries. This soft power strategy was implemented in sharp contrast to the country's historical status as a militaristic power. Starting in 1980, following the emergence of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Japan began to increase its nation branding efforts through the release of a television series titled , a Japanese soap opera. was distributed at no cost outside of Japan, and was well received in forty-six countries. Through the success of and multiple other television shows, Japan successfully established the idea of \\"Cool Japan\\" as a method of establishing and improving the country's cultural perception. In a 2002 article in Foreign Policy titled \\"Japan's Gross National Cool\\", Douglas McGray wrote of Japan \\"reinventing superpower\\" as its cultural influence expanded internationally, despite the economic and political problems of the \\"lost decade\\". Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, video games, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, cuisine, and phenomena of kawaii (\\"cuteness\\") such as Hello Kitty, McGray highlighted Japan's considerable cultural soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan's recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths. Adoption Taken up in the international media, with The New York Times running a retrospect \\"Year in Ideas: Pok√©mon Hegemon\\", an increasing number of more reform-minded government officials and business leaders in Japan began to refer to the country's \\"gross national cool\\" and to adopt the unofficial slogan \\"Cool Japan\\". In a 2005 press conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs linked the idea to Bhutan's concept of Gross National Happiness. The phrase gained greater exposure in the mid-noughties as NHK began a series Cool Japan which by the end of 2009 had reached over a hundred episodes. Academic initiatives include the establishment of a \\"Cool Japan\\" research project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while some western universities have reported an increase in the number of applicants for Japanese Studies courses due to the \\"cool\\" effect. The adoption of Cool Japan has also spurred changes in culture studies. As a result of the fascination of Cool Japan with Japanese youth culture and schoolgirls, a new wave of studies called 'girl studies' focuses specifically on the experience of girls and the girls-at-heart. Previously a subject of adolescent psychology or feminism, girl studies emerged from Cool Japan to include an interdisciplinary analysis of girl culture. Creative Industries Promotion Office The Japanese government has identified the culture industry as one of five potential areas of growth. In June 2010, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry established a new Creative Industries Promotion Office to promote cultural and creative industries as a strategic sector \\"under the single, long term concept of \\"Cool Japan\\", to coordinate different government functions, and to cooperate with the private sector\\". The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Japanese pop culture is one of the key elements for Cool Japan and that pop culture includes idol, anime, and . The deputy director described its mission as to \\"brand Japanese products with the uniqueness of Japanese culture\\". For 2011, it has a budget of ¬•19 billion. In fiscal 2008, public spending on cultural activities was ¬•116.9 billion in South Korea, ¬•477.5 billion in China, and ¬•101.8 billion in Japan, respectively 0.79%, 0.51%, and 0.12% of total government spending. The fund was launched in 2013, and the Japanese government committed to the Cool Japan Fund ¬•50 billion ($500 million) over 20 years, with a target of ¬•60 billion ($600 million) via private investor partnerships. However, Nikkei Asian Review reported that within five years the fund \\"suffered pretax losses totaling 10 billion yen ($88.9 million)\\" and many projects failed to deliver earnings, and since June 2018 the management is led by former Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) CEO Naoki Kitagawa.

Criticism A 2010 editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun argued that the government was not doing enough to advance the country's business interests in this sphere, allowing South Korea to emerge as a competitor. The editorial highlighted structural inefficiencies, with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry promoting \\"Cool Japan\\", the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for cultural exchange, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in charge of Japanese foods. Lecturer Roland Kelts has also suggested that a failure to fully distinguish, brand and engage the overseas audience and market may mean that \\"Cool Japan\\" is \\"over\\". In 2011, Laura Miller has critiqued Cool Japan campaign as exploiting and misrepresenting youth subcultural fashion and language.Miller, Laura. ‚ÄúCute masquerade and the pimping of Japan.‚Äù International Journal of Japanese Sociology. Vol. 20, Issue. 1, pp. 18‚Äì29, 2011.

It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say it has fallen into a downward spiral of wasted tax money flowing into little known companies\\", and that such lack of support is causing Japan to \\"fall behind its Asian neighbors in terms of cultural exports\\". In 2016, Benjamin Boas pointed out that Cool Japan-branded efforts are often promoted without participation of foreigners, leaving out the perspectives of the very foreigners that they are trying to target. In 2017, a senior executive and several other senior male employees of Cool Japan Fund Inc. were accused of sexual harassment targeting female employees of the fund. The employees formed a labor union in order to fight against sexual harassment. In the same year, Nikkei Asian Review journalist Yuta Saito criticized fund's ambitions because their \\"lack of strategy, discipline gives rise to unprofitable projects\\", and there's possible conflict of interest by the executives. In 2018, Japan Today reported too soon to consider it \\"grossly incompetent or corrupt\\", but it's at least \\"under-performing\\" for now.

He first settled in Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but he had difficulty with the Puritan authority and soon followed Roger Williams to Providence, becoming one of the original proprietors of that town. In 1643, he joined Samuel Gorton and ten others in purchasing land that became the town of Warwick. Difficulties with Massachusetts ensued, until he accompanied Gorton on a trip to England where they secured royal recognition of their town. Once Warwick became safe from external threats, Greene became active in its government. He served on the town council, was Deputy to the General Court of the colony, and served as magistrate of the General Court of Trials. He died in the last days of 1658, being survived by his wife and six grown children, and becoming the ancestor of many prominent citizens.  Early life  John Greene was likely born at Boweridge Hall in Gillingham, Dorset, England, and was the son of Richard Greene, whose father was also named Richard. He became a surgeon and moved to Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, where he was married at St Thomas in 1619 to Joane Tattersall (or Tatarsole) and where all of his children were baptized. On 6 April 1635, he and his family boarded the ship James at Southampton, England and sailed to New England, arriving in Boston on 3 June, and then going to Salem for a short while.  Providence  Town layout of Providence with Greene, Jr.'s lot fifth from the top and Greene, Sr.'s lot tenth from the top. Greene was consistently resistant to the Puritan authority of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he moved to Providence with Roger Williams within a year or two of his arrival in New England. He used this sanctuary to write haranguing letters to Massachusetts, speaking contemptuously of the magistrates, and he was fined 20 pounds in September 1637 and ordered not to come into the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts colony. In 1638, he was one of the 12 persons to whom Roger Williams deeded land, becoming one of the original proprietors of that settlement. He was also one of the 12 original members of the First Baptist Church in America located there.  Warwick  In October 1642, Greene bought a neck of land with a little island from Indian sachem Miantonomi and named the property Occupassuatuxet. This land remained in his family for the following 140 years. He became a close friend of Samuel Gorton, and they and ten others purchased another tract of land from Miantonomi in January 1643 and named it Shawomet, which later became the Warwick settlement. The following September, many of these Shawomet settlers were summoned to appear in court in Massachusetts, based on charges of fraud brought against them from two minor Indian sachems. The settlers refused the summons, telling the court that Massachusetts Bay did not have jurisdiction over their land, in response to which soldiers were sent and several of the settlers were taken to Boston. Greene and his son John Jr. both escaped to Conanicut Island and were never captured. Those who were taken to Massachusetts were tried, but they were not tried for the charges of fraud brought by the Indians. Instead, they stood trial concerning their theological beliefs, and several of them were convicted of blasphemy and incarcerated for those beliefs. They were released a few months later, then banished from Massachusetts‚Äîand also from their homes in Shawomet. Greene, Gorton, and Randall Holden sailed to England seeking redress for the wrongs done to them, but they had to board a ship in New Amsterdam because they were banned from going to Boston. Gorton was able to get a royal decree for his settlement of Shawomet from the Earl of Warwick. Greene and Holden returned to New England with this important document in 1646, while Gorton remained in England for another two years. When he returned in 1648, he renamed the settlement \\"Warwick\\" in honor of the earl who helped him get the protection that they needed.  Later life and family  John Greene's grave marker, Surgeon John Greene Cemetery, Warwick Greene served on the Warwick town council in 1647 and 1648, was the Warwick Deputy to the Rhode Island General Court from 1649 to 1657, and was named one of the Warwick freeman on a 1655 list of freemen. He was the magistrate for the Rhode Island General Court of Trials in March 1656. He died sometime between 28 December 1658 when he wrote his will, and 7 January 1659 when it was proved. He, his wife, and many descendants are buried in the Surgeon John Greene Cemetery, now located behind the Narraganset Bay Baptist Church on West Shore Road in Warwick. Greene had seven children, six of whom grew to maturity, and all with his first wife Joan Tattershall (or Tatarsole). The oldest child was John, who lived a long life which was almost entirely devoted to public service, including 10 one-year terms as Deputy Governor of the colony. Their son Peter married Mary Gorton, a daughter of colonial President Samuel Gorton. Great-grandson William Greene Sr. served as Governor of the colony for 11 one-year terms during the middle of the 18th century, and his son William Greene Jr. served as the second governor of the State of Rhode Island during the American Revolutionary War. Greene is also the ancestor of former United States President Warren G. Harding and of General Nathanael Greene, the only American general in the American Revolutionary War to serve for the entire war, besides George Washington.

Samuels, MD, DSc (hon), FAAN, MACP, FRCP, FANA, is an American physician, neurologist and teacher of medicine. He writes on the relationships between neurology and the rest of medicine, and has linked the nervous system with cardiac function, highlighting the mechanisms and prevention of neurogenic cardiac disease. Education and training Born in Cleveland, Ohio on June 24, 1945, Samuels attended Cleveland Heights High School, where he was an honors graduate and president of the 3,300 student body. He delivered the graduation address, elected by his class, and was later elected to the Cleveland Heights High School Hall of Fame. Samuels credits his own childhood pediatrician in Cleveland, Dr. J.W. Epstein, with providing early inspiration for his future career path in medicine. He was also exposed to medicine, and specifically the brain-heart connection, before medical school through his cousin, Matthew Levy, a cardiovascular physiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital and Case Western Reserve Medical School. Samuels received his Bachelor of Arts degree in biology from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1967, where, as elected class speaker, he delivered an address titled \\"Lumberjackets and Dogs.\\" In 1971 he received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, where he was elected to the Pi Kappa Epsilon Honor Society and was selected as class speaker to deliver an Honors Day Address titled \\"Mark Hopkins on One End and I on the Other.\\" The University of Cincinnati later awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree (2005). In 2011, Samuels was asked to deliver the Honors Day Address, titled \\"Invaders from Mars with Commentary by Robbie Burns,\\" to mark the 40th anniversary of his 1971 graduation address. Samuels also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1993. During medical school, Samuels was influenced by a number of mentors, including Benjamin Felson, Richard Vilter, Edward Gall, Roger Crafts, Evelyn Hess, Gustave Eckstein and Charles Aring, the latter of whom drew him into the field of neurology. He spent a period of time in hepatology and immunology research with the late Dame Professor Sheila Sherlock at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The work resulted in his first scientific publication in Gut showing that a serum factor present in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis was responsible for the autoimmune nature of the disease. Following medical school, Samuels trained first by completing a full residency in internal medicine at the Boston City Hospital, serving as the medical chief resident in 1974-5, and then as a junior resident in neurology (1973-4), as a fellow in neuropathology (1975‚Äì76) and senior resident in neurology (1976‚Äì77) at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Samuels is board certified in both Internal Medicine and Neurology. Clinical career Samuels is the only neurologist cited in all editions of Castle & Connolly Best Doctors in America. He is able to consult on complex problems, particularly in the interface between general medicine and neurology. Following his formal training, Samuels created a new neurology service, of which he served as chief until 1988, at the West Roxbury (MA) Veterans Administration Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospital. There he was instrumental in the merger of two VA hospitals to create the Brockton-West Roxbury VA Medical Center, a model that has since been replicated throughout the VA system. In 1988, Samuels was recruited to the Brigham and Women's Hospital to create a Department of Neurology from a small division in the department of medicine. In 1994, the department was formally instituted, with Samuels as its founding chair. Since its launch, the relatively new department has grown to include over 250 academic appointments, including 20 full professors, six with endowed chairs, at the Harvard Medical School; one of the largest programs in basic, translational and clinical research with over $40,000,000 in annual research support; 15 divisions; an inpatient neurology service; an epilepsy monitoring unit; a 20-bed neurological-neurosurgical intensive care unit; and ambulatory programs in all major areas of neurological medicine. Basic and clinical research from the department comprises work on Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmunity, Parkinson's disease, neuromuscular diseases, epilepsy, stroke, and cancer neurology. In addition to serving as chairman of the department, Samuels maintains an active clinical practice at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, seeing patients with complex neurological problems. He serves regularly as the attending neurologist for inpatient and consultation services (named the Martin A. Samuels Neurology Consultation Service in 2010) at the Brigham, and regularly provides guidance to neurology residents and students on treating the most complex problems. In 2018, after serving for 30 years as Founding Chair of Neurology at the Brigham, Samuels stepped down from the Chair to become the Emeritus Founding Chair of Neurology at the Brigham and Distinguished Miriam Sydney Joseph Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. He continues to be a full-time member of the Department of Neurology where he sees patients and teaches residents and students. For his clinical accomplishments, Samuels has been honored with Fellowship in the American Academy of Neurology, Fellowship in the American Neurological Association, Fellowship in the Royal College of Physicians (London) and Mastership in the American College of Physicians. He has been the discusser in 13 New England Journal of Medicine Clinical Pathology Conferences‚Äîthe most ever discussed by a single person. * * * * * * *Samuels MA, DeLaMonte S.

Major research and publications Samuels has studied and written extensively on the interface between neurology and the rest of medicine, including neurocardiology, neurohematology, neurohepatology, neuronephrology, neurorheumatology, and the neurological aspects of organ transplantation and acid-base and electrolyte disturbances. His most well-known contributions relate to the mechanisms and prevention of neurogenic cardiac disease.Samuels MA. \\"The brain-heart connection. Circulation 2007; 116; 77-84 Samuels has studied \\"voodoo death\\", or death caused by fright or intense emotion, which triggers a series of neuro- physiological changes through high levels of catecholamines. He has articulated a unifying hypothesis that explains the mechanisms whereby the nervous system can produce cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial necrosis in a number of clinical contexts including subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, brain tumor, epilepsy and psychological stress. This research, the subject of Samuels' lecture \\"Voodoo Death Revisited: The Modern Lessons of Neurocardiology\\", earned Samuels the H. Houston Merritt Award, granted every two years by the American Academy of Neurology for clinically relevant research. Samuels has spoken on his research at the Cleveland Clinic Heart-Brain Summit (2006)Cleveland Clinic Heart-Brain Summit (2006) and the International Academy of Cardiology's World Congress on Heart Disease, where he delivered the H.

Often called \\" a multi-disciplinary and polymath entrepreneur \\" by the international press, he has created different companies in the fashion, art, PR, and beauty industry since the early 90s. Among the projects he has worked on, he counts with two ready-to-wear brands, \\" R√©sistance \\", \\" RT \\" and \\" L‚ÄôAfrican\\", a restaurant based in Tangier, Morocco. He is also known for revamping the world's oldest wax manufacture Cire Trudon. Alongside his wife Victoire de Taillac, he is behind the Parisian 19th-century beauty brand, l‚ÄôOfficine Universelle Buly.  Influence of skateboarding on fashion = Teuchy  In 1993, he created the first \\"Teuchy\\" tee-shirt, a spontaneous sample of \\"Stussy\\", the famous tag of a skateboarding label. Not long after, Ramdane Touhami sampled a second brand, \\" Teuchiland \\", riffing on the Timberland logo with a reference to cannabis. The brand's t-shirt was sold in twenty shops.  King Size  In 1996, aiming to search for a music producer, he leaves his hometown and goes to Paris, \\" with 50 French Francs and a pair of underwear \\", he quotes. Looking for a new experience, he introduces himself as a stylist, around the Sentier neighborhood, known as a textile and garment manufacturing district. He is then hired by one shop, and thanks to this last one's support, Ramdane Touhami launches the French skateboard clothing brand \\" King Size \\". The brand is sold in sixty shops, and sponsors skateboard champion, Tom Penny.  L‚Äô√âpicerie = Polette  During his \\" King Size \\" phase, the idea of creating a place where he could present a selection of aesthetic creations, from clothing, accessories, to music, magazines and art pieces was born. But the project wasn't ready yet, due to financial reasons. In January 1997, Ramdane Touhami is ready to launch his project, when, Colette, a new concept store opens at Rue Saint Honor√©, in the 2nd district in Paris. He creates a new t-shirt called Polette (mocking Colette), which becomes an immediate buzz, due to the cynical and ironic tone of the text written on the back of the t-shirt. 286 copies of it were sold through different distribution channels. ClassOf1999  L‚Äô√âpicerie  Opened on 17 September 1998, at 30, rue du Temple, in the 3rd district in Paris. L‚Äô√âpicerie embodies the anti-Colette. With his friend, Artus de Lavill√©on, he created an activist movement dedicated to support new rising designers. The idea captured the attention of renowned designers such as Jeremy Scott, Marc Jacobs, Jean Touitou, J√©r√¥me Dreyfuss. L‚Äô√âpicerie slowly becomes, both a music shop and an art gallery. The collaborations with different designers are a big success, \\" X by l‚Äô√âpicerie \\", \\" L‚Äô√âpicerie by X \\" and this is when, the shop starts to be called \\" the trendiest shop in Europe \\" by Dazed & Confused, Herald Tribune, Le Monde, Vogue and The New York Times. On 3 April 1999, l‚Äô√âpicerie closes its doors.  Projet Hypeteam  Consulted by Renault, for creative design research, he starts working on different side project of his own. In 1999, he launches \\" hypeteam.com \\", a website result of his travels to Japan and the discovery of unknown and forgotten European brands. Without this technology, all of these treasures would have remained inaccessible. The website was developed as an international airport, with destinations three destinations, Paris, Stockholm and Tokyo. A specific universe corresponds to each \\"boarding area\\", including different boutiques and categories of purchases on the site. The products sold on Hypeteam were not available outside the website, a selection of imported goods and exclusive sales.  Fashion designer: Japanese inspiration  And.A Tokyo  And.A  Headed by Riku Susuki, the Japanese Group Sazaby wants to reinvent their brand. The group owns a brand store which can make this mission possible, And.A. It counts with thirteen shops, and targets a \\" salary japanese woman \\", offering goods such as, tableware, accessories, clothing, plants). The aim is to relaunch the brand and repositioning it, with a more coherent and improved brand image. Ramdane Touhami is named creative director, and on 25 April 2000, he moves to Tokyo, in order to set up a new team and a new office. Everything has to be completely redesigned, without disintegrating the brand image. The interior architecture of the boutique stores, the visual identity and marketing materials, purchasing, display, the creation of clothing collections for men and women, and even the musical selection.  College et Coolax  And.A Osaka He starts this new project with a clean slate, which includes two clothing-line collections and accessories for And.A, College (the first preppy revival) and Coolax (street), a specialized selection of products (electronics, furniture, books, magazines, jewels‚Ä¶) and a policy of selective releases or reissues of products (watches), the new personality of And.A.‚Äôs line. Additionally, he starts prospecting, selecting and negotiating with new suppliers. Ramdane Touhami himself performed these \\"door-to-door\\" calls to better inspire confidence in the brand's renewal among his contacts and manufacturers. The collection designed by him for And.A is called \\"Coll√®ge\\". A curious class photo inspired him: the unusual mental tableau of two rows of half-Tokyoite, half-Oxfordian schoolchildren led him to revisit ‚Äúschool clothes‚Äù. The result was a hybrid between the clothes worn by British and Japanese secondary school students. Playing on the constraint of the uniform, of the off-beat creativity generated by this code, he found ways to reach a market known to be difficult and very choosy through one of his iconic themes. Interpreting outfit elements one by one (three-quarter raincoats, pleated skirts, trousers, shirts, cardigans, teddy), Ramdane Touhami brought them forward to free them from constraints. Tools of predilection, prints, patches, shoulder patches, punctuate his work, as well as the attention paid to fabric selection and the care for details. The collection was presented in Paris in October and in Tokyo in November 2000. ‚ÄúCoolax‚Äù, a collection designed for a more masculine and street public. This collection will only be sold in Osaka and Aoyama. Consisting on t-shirts, trousers, sweats, jackets and accessories marked with a gold rivet, (one of the designer's signatures). The thirteen boutiques opened their doors on 12 March 2001. For this collection, he uses the same camouflage print launched in 1998, by l‚Äô√âpicerie, which becomes one of its classics. Each of these collections, \\" Coll√®ge \\" and \\" Coolax \\" has its own graphic identity. Along with his team, he designs the architecture of the shops and works on each one's visual identity. Therefore, each collection has a strong image. And.A Design He uses a matt black cube when designing the shops. This cube, in all its forms, creates step by step, the universe of the shops (fa√ßade, internal volume, furniture, lighting).  RT and R√©sistance  Ramdane Touhami launches a chic, classic, made by local craftsmen new clothing line, called RT. He designs and develops the fabric and the printed patterns which are used in the collection. All the pattern making takes place in Japan. A second brand called R√©sistance is then launched. This last one has a more urban style. The designer honors some of the most important historic and politic icons. In terms of distribution, Ramdane Touhami, decides to do a pop-up store, before the increase in popularity of concept stores. The Parisian shop, placed in the heart of the Latin Quarter, is called \\" bureau politique \\" (Political Office). They don't show any clothing piece on the window display. From the selection of atypical models, the catwalk decor, the design of the shops, to its staff and musical conception, Touhami works alongside : Howie B, the Black Panthers, Hangin Tan, Darius Khondji, Philippe Parreno. ResistanceRT Bureau politique R.T. & R√©sistance clothing lines are sold in 180 retail stores around the world : \\" Maria Luisa \\" in Paris, \\" Nom de guerre \\" in New York City, \\" Isetan \\" √† Tokyo, among others.  Aesthetics: From fashion to fragrances = Parfumerie G√©n√©rale  Upon his return to France, he starts a new entrepreneurship project. Inspired by his wife‚Äôs passion, he creates, with a small budget, a new concept store specialized in beauty and cosmetics, called Parfumerie G√©n√©rale. Located in the 8th district of Paris, this store offered a selection of one hundred brands. Most of them new to the French market. As the creative director, he designs a shop dedicated to men, mixing the concept of a beauty bar with the one of a barber shop corner. A different color is used to differentiate each product category, a unique graphic universe, with the aim of breaking the rules of the existent beauty shops. The cosmetic's industry luxury codes are updated, all the skincare and makeup are displayed by categories. A mail order catalogue, a graphic novel \\" Beauty Notes \\" are launched. A second sale point is created at the French department store, Printemps.  Cire Trudon  In 2006, a French wax manufacture owner offers Ramdane Touhami the possibility of taking over the company with him, in order to reinvent it. Touhami starts studying the history of the company, and rediscovers the history of the \\" Trudon Manufacture \\". A company founded on 1643, and appointed the title of \\" Royal candle maker \\".  Officine Universelle Buly 1803  Alongside his wife, Victoire de Taillac, he reinvented the 19th-century perfumery, of the once master perfumer Jean-Vincent Buly. He is the inspiration behind 1839 Honor√© de Balzac‚Äôs, Cesar Birotteau book. An ancient apothecary, a one of a kind perfumery and a worldwide source of unknown beauty secrets, l'Officine Universelle Buly 1803 embodies a quintessential beauty. In 2014, the duo opens their first old-school apothecary, at 6, rue Bonaparte, in the 6th district in Paris, and their second one, in 2017 in the trendy Parisian neighborhood, le Marais at 45, rue de Saintonge, in the 3rd district in Paris. Within this last address, they awaken another 19th-century Parisian legend, the Caf√© Tortoni (originally located on Boulevard des italiens), associated also to \\"Nani Kor√©\\", a Japanese bakery stand and finally, a dried-flower florist. L‚ÄôOfficine Universelle Buly has been called the \\" New French Empire \\" by journals like The New York Times, and today it counts with shops in Taipei Tokyo, New York City, London, Hong Kong Seoul.  Collaborations  Parfumerie G√©n√©rale  Castelbajac  In 1999, he works on the creation of Jean-Charles de Castelbajac's concept store. For the musical conception, he works with Ariel Wizman, and for the graphic conception with Yorgo Tloupas.  Bon March√©‚Äôs \\" Corner 33 1 R lax \\"  In 1999, while Ramdane Touhami was working on the \\" hypeteam.com \\", the Parisian department store, Le Bon March√©, reaches out to him in order to work a new project. This one consists on designing the \\" hype corner \\" on Paris‚Äô Left bank. He creates the \\" 33 1 R lax \\", an area reuniting magazines, CDs, electronic devices, furniture, accessories. He works once again with Yorgo Tloupas for the visual identity of the place. Santa Eulalia shop  Santa Eulalia  Searching to reinvent their brand concept, Santa Eulalia, a luxury shop based in Barcelona, Spain contacts him to do the job. Founded in 1843, the brand belongs since the 19th-century to the Sanz, a traditional and genuine Catalan family. Ramdane Touhami sets up a \\" bar √† eaux de cologne \\" (perfume bar), the idea behind it was to create a perfumer's palette, with different types of scents. For the restaurant, he created a bistro-inspired decoration with Thonet chairs, with a menu offering typical and casual Catalan food. He does some consulting, on purchasing and creation, plus designs a pop up corners \\" collection \\" for different brands, such us : Maison Michel, Moncler, Aesop, Lego, Mariage Fr√®res.

The RCN force managed to sink or damage some of the escorts on the surface, but the U-boat was able to escape.  Background  The port of Brest had been an important German U-boat base since the Fall of France, and its capture was one of the objectives of Operation Overlord. With the increasing effectiveness of the Allied anti-submarine campaign however it often became essential for any U-boat departing the port to have surface escorts. The German Kriegsmarine would often employ Vorpostenboot-class escort trawlers to accomplish that task, and over time these boats developed a reputation among the Allied navies. On 5 July 1944 Escort Group 12 and Escort Group 14 were deployed to the vicinity of Brest as part of Operation Dredger; EG 12 (Consisting of the RCN River-class destroyers , , and ) was tasked with intercepting the ships escorting the U-boats, while EG 14 would patrol further offshore to intercept any U-boats that managed to escape. Battle departed Brest on 5 July 1944 under the protection of 4 Vorpostenboot escort trawlers. Escort Group 12, with HMCS Qu'Appelle as the lead boat, detected the German force on radar and set off in pursuit at 30 knots. Milner p. 146 The two sides engaged in the vicinity of the Pierres Noires lighthouse in the late evening. The darkness, combined with uncertainty of the size of the German force and the close range at which the ships engaged each other nullified some of the advantage in speed and armour enjoyed by EG 12, and U-741 managed to escape. However, despite inflicting some damage to all of the Canadian vessels, the Vorpostenboot V-715 was sunk, another was heavily damaged, and the remainder withdrew to Brest. EG 12 withdrew to Portsmouth for repairs.  Aftermath  Operation Dredger would continue with further Allied naval infiltration into the Bay of Biscay, engaging the U-boats and their escorts in their home waters. U-741 was sunk in the English Channel on 15 August, a few days after American forces began to lay siege to Brest. The last U-boat departed on 4 September, just before the Americans took control of the city on 19 September . HMCS Skeena would be lost in a storm off Iceland on 25 October, the only ship from EG 12 not to survive the war.

October 16, 1929, Cluj) is a Romanian quantum physicist and a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy since 1974. He made fundamental contributions to the quantum theories of electromagnetic interactions with atoms. Education His parents were Ion and Florica GavrilƒÉ (n√©e Vi»ôoiu). His father taught medicine and his mother taught English at the University of Cluj. He began his higher education at the Gheorghe LazƒÉr High School in Sibiu, and completed his studies at the Seminarul Pedagogic Universitar of the University of Cluj. Then, in 1948, he enrolled in the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Bucharest, from which he graduated in 1953 with a major in physics, and a minor in radiotechnology. While still a student, between 1951 and 1953, he became a teaching assistant to Professor Eugen BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu in the Optics Laboratory of the School of Physics. Doctoral studies In 1953, GavrilƒÉ was accepted for doctoral studies in theoretical physics by Professor »òerban »öi»õeica in the School of Physics at the University of Bucharest. He completed successfully his doctoral studies with a Ph.D. thesis entitled The Relativistic Theory of the Photoelectric Effect, building on work of Albert Einstein and Alexandru Proca.Alexandru Proca. \\"On the relativistic theory of Dirac's electron\\" Ph.D. thesis defended by Alexandru Proca under Nobel laureate Louis de Broglie at Sorbonne University He published in 1959 the main results of his Ph.D. thesis in a peer-reviewed paper in Physical Review.Mihai Gavrila: Relativistic K-Shell Photoeffect, Physical Review, 113 (2), 514‚Äì526 (1959) Academic career In 1956, GavrilƒÉ was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Thermodynamics, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics of the School of Physics of the University of Bucharest, where he was subsequently promoted to Associate Professorsh in 1962, and to full Professor in 1968. He also studied as a visiting scholar at several major physics centers around the world: the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Soviet Union, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder, Colorado, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and the University of Pittsburgh, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He taught courses on Quantum mechanics, Group representations, and Lorentz group transformations. He was elected a corresponding Member of the Romanian Academy in 1974. However, in spite of his election to the Academy, he refused to become entangled in any political affairs under the increasingly dictatorial communist regime, and finally he had to leave his country for Norway in the autumn of 1974. At first, GavrilƒÉ worked at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim) and at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1975 he settled in Amsterdam at the FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF), where he became the theoretical physics group leader. Since 1992 he has worked as a Senior Scientist at the Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (ITAMP) based at the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After 1990 he was able to visit Romania several times and continued to contribute also to the development of theoretical physics research in Romania. Scientific achievements Atomic Dichotomy.

Afterwards, he returned to his family in the mountains where his father and brothers avoided Mussolini's fascist indoctrinations. One of which, Baglioni recalled was, ‚ÄúIf you did not join, they would make you drink castor oil every day until you joined. I jumped on my horse, bareback, and rode up into the hills, hid in a cave until the fascists left.‚Äù European career After the war, Baglioni moved to Rome where he went to architecture school then two years later he went to San Remo for hotel school and language study where he learned French and German. When he finished school, he went to work in Lausanne, Switzerland. Several years later, he was offered a job in London, England, where he learned English and worked at the Savoy Hotel. On September 23, 1959, he accepted a job offer as host / chef at the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York City. While employed at the Four Seasons he met many influential people, among them Jack Warner, of Warner Brothers Studios. Ciao Italia Ciao Italia is a worldwide organization formed for the purpose of generalizing Italian food. Baglioni explained, ‚ÄúEvery little town, hamlet, and city in Italia has their particular style of food. For instance if one asks for marinara sauce in southern Italy it is a heavy sauce, redder in color, but if one asks the same sauce in northern Italy it is lighter in color, almost pink. Through Ciao Italia we tried to create a commonality of Italian food in order to promote Italian food worldwide.‚ÄùIn an interview with Emilio Baglioni, April 2011 Baglioni served as president of the California chapter of Ciao Italia Organization for 1979‚Äì1984. Personal life Baglioni, presently divorced, was married to Pauline, a British subject; they had six children, Pina, Dino, Milo, Samantha, Paula, & Marcelo. Emilio has one daughter from a subsequent relationship, Brooke. His current life-partner is the actress Tina Scala, an actress and younger sister of Gia Scala.

He served as acting governor for about a year between the death of the Earl of Bellomont and the arrival of Bellomont's successor, Lord Cornbury. During the Glorious Revolution in 1688 he served as a captain in William of Orange's invasion army with Bellomont, who was his uncle by marriage. Nanfan was born in Birtsmorton, Worcestershire, joined the British Army rising to rank of Captain. While Nanfan was acting as governor of New York in 1701, he made a peace treaty with the Iroquois. According to the text, the Five Nations formally deeded what they considered to be their western lands, extending from present-day western New York to Chicago, Illinois, to King William of England. The Five Nations had conquered much of this area in the 1670s with firearms during the later Beaver Wars, although in fact by 1701, had already lost effective control of most of it again to Algonquian tribes assisted by the French, who then had the strongest actual military presence in the region. Despite this Iroquois sale of all the lands they had recently lost, the English made no practical attempt to settle them, although the treaty was later used in conflicts with the French to assert British sovereignty in them. Nanfan married a woman from Barbados. Upon the arrival of Lord Cornbury in 1702, Nanfan's political enemies had him arrested for alleged malfeasance in office. He was ordered released by the king after a year and a half in prison, after which he managed to again evade arrest and make his way to England by 1705 and died in Greenwich in 1716.

Typical antifouling coatings are not biomimetic but are based on synthetic chemical compounds that can have deleterious effects on the environment. Prime examples are tributyltin compounds, which are components in paints to prevent biofouling of ship hulls. Although highly effective at combatting the accumulation of barnacles and other problematic organisms, organotin-containing paints are damaging to many organisms and have been shown to interrupt marine food chains.Salta, M., Wharton, J.

Mueller, W. E. G., Wang, X., Proksch, P., Perry, C. C., Osinga, R., Garderes, J., Schroeder, H. C., \\"Principles of Biofouling Protection in Marine Sponges: A Model for the Design of Novel Biomimetic and Bio-inspired Coatings in the Marine Environment?\\", Mar. Biotechnol. 2013, 15, 375.1\\\\. Gittens, J. E., Smith, T. J., Suleiman, R., Akid, R., \\"Current and emerging environmentally-friendly systems for fouling control in the marine environment\\", Biotechnol. Adv. 2013, 31, 1738. Chemical methods Most antifouling coatings are based upon chemical compounds that inhibit fouling. When incorporated into marine coatings, these biocides leach into the immediate surroundings and minimize fouling. The classic synthetic antifouling agent is tributyltin (TBT). Natural biocides typically show lower environmental impact but variable effectiveness. The chemical structure of bufalin (3,4-dihydroxybufa-20,22 dienolide) Natural biocides are found in a variety of sources, including sponges, algae, corals, sea urchins, bacteria, and sea-squirts, and include toxins, anaesthetics, and growth/attachment/metamorphosis-inhibiting molecules. As a group, marine microalgae alone produce over 3600 secondary metabolites that play complex ecological roles including defense from predators, as well as antifouling protection, increasing scientific interest in the screening of marine natural products as natural biocides. Natural biocides are typically divided into two categories: terpenes (often containing unsaturated ligand groups and electronegative oxygen functional groups) and nonterpenes. Various tannins (nonterpene), naturally synthesized by a variety of plants, are effective biocides when combined with copper and zinc salts. The tannins are able to flocculate with a variety of cations, which then exhibit antiseptic properties. The most effective natural biocide is 3,4-dihydroxybufa-20,22 dienolide, or bufalin (a steroid of toad poison from Bufo vulgaris), which is over 100 times more effective than TBT at preventing biofouling. Bufalin is however expensive. A few natural compounds with simpler synthetic routes, such as nicotinamide or 2,5,6-tribromo-1-methylgramine (from Zoobotryon pellucidum), have been incorporated into patented antifouling paints. A significant drawback to biomimetic chemical agents is their modest service life. Since the natural biocides must leach out of the coating to be effective, the rate of leaching is a key parameter. > \\\\text{Total biocide release} = { L_\\\\text{a} \\\\times a \\\\times W_\\\\text{a} > \\\\times 100 \\\\over\\\\ SVR \\\\times SPG \\\\times DFT} Where La is the fraction of the biocide actually released (typically around 0.7), a is the weight fraction of the active ingredient in the biocide, DFT is the dry film thickness, Wa is the concentration of the natural biocide in the wet paint, SPG is the specific gravity of the wet paint, and SVR is the percentage of dry paint to wet paint by volume. Shark skin mimetics One class of biomimetic antifouling coatings is inspired by the surface of shark skin, which consists of nanoscale overlapping plates that exhibit parallel ridges that effectively prevent sharks from becoming fouled even when moving at slow speeds. The antifouling qualities of the shark skin-inspired designs appear highly dependent upon the engineered roughness index (ERI). ERI = { r \\\\times n \\\\over 1 - \\\\phi} Where r is the Wenzel roughness ratio, n is the number of distinct surface features in the design of the surface, and œÜ is the area fraction of the tops of the distinct surface features. A completely smooth surface would have an ERI = 0. Using this equation, the amount of microfouling spores per mm2 can be modeled. Similar to actual shark skin, the patterned nature of Sharklet AF shows microstructural differences in three dimensions with a corresponding ERI of 9.5. This three-dimensional patterned difference imparts a 77% reduction in microfouling settlement. Other artificial nonpatterned nanoscale rough surfaces such as 2-Œºm-diameter circular pillars (ERI = 5.0) or 2-Œºm-wide ridges (ERI = 6.1) reduce fouling settlement by 36% and 31%, respectively, while a more patterned surface composed of 2-Œºm-diameter circular pillars and 10-Œºm equilateral triangles (ERI = 8.7) reduces spore settlement by 58%. The contact angles obtained for hydrophobic surfaces are directly related to surface roughnesses by the Wenzel equation. Conclusions Biomimetic antifouling coatings are highly lucrative because of their low environmental impact and demonstrated success. Some properties of a biomimetic antifouling coating can be predicted from the contact angles obtained from the Wenzel equation, and the calculated ERI. Natural materials such as shark skin continue to provide inspiration for scientists to improve the coatings currently on the market.

He also was a pioneer in creating and developing in the Brazilian press the concept of a Newspaper supplement, delivering to the reader special editions on a comprehensive format and reading style easily understood in a number of political, economical and historical facts. Early life Native of S√£o Paulo, he was born from Hyphatia de Azevedo Barbosa's marriage to Horacio de Castro Villas B√¥as, on 20 December 1902,in S√£o Paulo. Horacio, born in Angra dos Reis, State of Rio de Janeiro, a beloved son of Manoel de Villas B√¥as, Portuguese born, and Maria Joana de Castro, from Angra, was one of the first telegraphists in the country and was transferred from Angra to S√£o Paulo both to train new telegraphists as well head the telegraph services in that city. Soon after Manoel's birth in 1907, Hyphatia died and one year later,1908, Horacio, leaving not only Manoel, as a baby, but also his two sisters, Concei√ß√£o and Fausta, under the care of his grandfather Manoel de Azevedo Barbosa and grandmother Maria Teixeira das Neves and his preferred aunt Carolina. He studied at the Instituto Mackenzie and Escola de Commercio Alvares Penteado, both in S√£o Paulo, and started working quite early in life, at the age of 15 to 16, as it was common in those days, at a manufacturing plant that belonged to his uncle, Teixeira das Neves. Self made career Soon he realized that working in a manufacturing industry, even if one belonging to his uncle, would not lead him to the kind of self enlightening and adventurous life he always pursued until the end of his lifetime. He then quit both his job and school, at age 17, and started a new life selling framed pictures all over Brazil and Uruguay. This gave him an excellent opportunity to start knowing the Brazilian hinterland, its realities and myths. At the age 19, 1926, he met Menotti Del Picchia and Pedro Ferraz do Amaral, lifelong friends and co-founders of the seminal \\"Semana de Arte Moderna\\" cultural movement, allowing him to take part in some of the late manifestations of that movement, while traveling thorough the country. In 1931, while still in S√£o Paulo, he had begun his entrepreneurship life investing in a Bugatti racing car in partnership with a friend, the pilot, to race in Brazil and hopefully to collect cash-awards. Unfortunately,however,the car got smashed during a \\"drive trial\\", when himself and the pilot were testing the car. All that was left was a broken nose and an aversion to possessing and driving cars, which he carried throughout his life. At age 25, in 1932, he settled in Bel√©m, state of Par√°, in the Brazilian Amazon, where he was a prosperous entrepreneur, founder and director of \\"Corpora√ß√£o Latino Americana de Artes\\"\\"A P√°tria\\",1935-01-16,pg.3 that financed and promoted state industrial and fine art fair and events. However, in 1934, Typhus, quite endemic in the amazon region at that time,forced him to seek for treatment in S√£o Paulo. Political career Back in S√£o Paulo, he was invited by Pedro Ferraz do Amaral, then editor-in-chief of the prestigious Correio de S√£o Paulo to join it as special editor,covering the news within the State of S√£o Paulo,which was by then emerging as Brazil's main economic powerhouse. Accepting it, and vested in that power, he then traveled 33 villages and towns within the State, visiting several counties and jurisdictions, interviewing their politicians, civil societies and even some of their founders, getting to know all kinds of new realities and facts in a time where the Brazilian political life was emerging from the lethargy of the Old Republic (1889‚Äì1930). On account of that, he was invited by Armando Salles de Oliveira to join the Partido Constitucionalista, the new reformist and democratic party, led by Salles de Oliveira, which proposed a new Brazilian Constitution founded on solid democratic principles and opposed to the autocratic political regimen imposed by the corruption of the ideals of the \\"Revolu√ß√£o de 30\\", a revolution that took place in 1930. Villas B√¥as' political adventures, however, did not take him quite further away since in 1935 a coup d'etat, so-called Estado Novo conducted Get√∫lio Vargas, as Dictator,into power, thus deceiving the aspirations and constitutional claims of the Partido Cosntitucionalista. Journalist Notwithstanding, his career as a journalist had been launched and he never quit it, although, his notorious taste for new horizons and challenges had directed him, here and there, to other areas of activities, as a real pioneer, a desbravador of the Brazilian hinterland. In 1935 at the age 28 he married Jenny Ida Maria Cerrini, 22 (27/01/1913, Pisa, Italy - 1994, S√£o Paulo, Brazil), and started his own family in the city of S√£o Paulo. From this marriage, three were the offspring, Maria Helena, born in 1936, Maria Lucia, born in 1938, and Roberto, born in 1943. In December 1936 he published Peda√ßos de S√£o Paulo (\\"Pieces of S√£o Paulo\\")Peda√ßos de S√£o Paulo, Estabelecimento Graphico O Cruzeiro do Sul, S√£o Paulo, 1936. a book covering his travels from 1935 to 1936 within the state, which in those days was still a highly adventurous endeavour. From 1935 to his death in 1979 he also regularly contributed to the Correio de S√£o Paulo (1935‚Äì1938), Jornal da Manh√£ (1939‚Äì1941), A Noite (1943‚Äì1944), Correio Paulistano (1945‚Äì1948), Estado de S√£o Paulo (1941 to 1943), Folha da Tarde, Folha de S.Paulo, Gazeta Mercantil (1968 to 1972) in S√£o Paulo, Correio da Manh√£, O Radical (1949‚Äì1952) ‚Äì and o Semanario, in Rio de Janeiro, as well as in several magazines, Brasil Gr√°fico (1955 to 1958), Revista de Organiza√ß√£o e Produtividade (1960‚Äì1967) and Revista Industria e Desenvolvimento (1972 to 1979). In 1949 he travelled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he interviewed Juan Domingo Per√≥n, the powerful politician and President of Argentina, producing a series of interesting and in-depth articles on the Argentine economy, political trends and social behaviour in a time where the Peronista movement was getting momentum in that rich country. In 1957 he travelled to Caracas, Venezuela, as a special reporter for Di√°rios AssociadosDi√°rios Associados interviewing politicians and civil society to expose Venezuela realities to Brazilian eyes. He also travelled to La Paz, Bolivia, to conduct a series of interviews with local political leaders and civil society, but was not successful since one of the several coups d√©tat just occurred at the time when he arrived in there, leaving him \\"arrested\\" in the country, without options to return, so chaotic was the situation initially. Desbravador In 1952, he received an invitation from a long standing friend Cel.Thyrso Silva Gomes to endeavor a totally different activity in the recently accessible locality of Quer√™ncia do Norte, Paranava√≠ in the State of Paran√°, southern of Brazil: to open, develop and manage Porto Bras√≠lio¬¥s port coffee plantation, which he gladly accepted as a new challenge to his life. Obviously to say that a much bigger challenge was that of his wife Jenny, left in S.Paulo, due to children's schooling,and taking care,alone,of their three children: M;Helena, M.Lucia and Roberto. Needless to say, during the period he stayed in Paranavai, with eventual visits to his family in S√£o Paulo, several were the occasions of real danger, since the region was quite wild in those days and a \\" western movie atmosphere\\" was present in the day-life. Once he convinced Jenny of moving, with all children, to Paranavai plantation. She accepted on the premises that she would have to SEE the place first ! So they went to Paranavai ! Traveling was fine up to the entrance of the farm, where a gunfire gang was awaiting the couple \\" to talk\\". With great ability and very courageously he drove the situation to his and Jenny's favor. Jenny, however, was so outraged that decided never to live there,but rather staying in S.Paulo, waiting for his return. In 1955,ending his successful farmer's experience, he returned to S√£o Paulo, and restarted his interrupted media contributions. A new engagement was awaiting for him: that of Brazil's producing and tasting the best coffee in the world,a campaign he developed throughout the Revista de Organiza√ß√£o e Produtividadehttp://alexandria.cpd.ufv.br=Idort and press in general as Consumo de Cafe e Cursos IBC, 1960,O Estado de S.

History  Counteradvertising was first formally introduced in the United States by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1972, although the concept was not new. The FTC tried to persuade the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the need for counteradvertising air time to balance the views expressed by commercial sponsors on television broadcasts. The FCC did not openly accept this suggestion, however, several counteradvertising spots were produced in the 1970s. Burt Lancaster acted as the talent for counteradvertising spots including Bayer aspirin and Chevrolet vehicles. These spots were counter- advocacy for these brands. Those who supported this form of advertising claimed that it was necessary to combat advertisers and gain freedom of speech. Those who would be fiscally impacted by counteradvertising, mostly broadcasters and advertisers, opposed this form of advertising claiming that it would destroy the television industry. The momentum of counteradvertising was decreasingly significantly by 1976, because broadcasters and advertisers combated the issue.

History Il Nucleo Tutela Patrimonio Artistico was founded by General Arnaldo Ferrara on 3 May 1969. It was the first specialist police force in the world in this sector, predating the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970. On 5 March 1992 the force was renamed Comando Carabinieri per la Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale. Organization The force has four sections: archaeology, antique dealing, fakes, and contemporary art. It is led by a colonel and headquartered in Rome, with twelve regional offices. It functions in coordination with the Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit√† Culturali. Activities The force investigates clandestine excavations, the theft and illicit trade in works of art, damage to monuments and archaeological zones, the illegal export of cultural property, and fakes. It is involved in the monitoring and control of archaeological sites, and the activities of art and antique dealers, junk shops, and restorers. The force is also involved in forensic analysis; the development and promotion of educational materials; advising overseas ministries, police forces and customs bodies; international peacekeeping missions; and the protection and recovery of cultural property in disaster zones. Partners The force works internationally with organisations including UNESCO, UNIDROIT, ICOMOS, ICOM, and INTERPOL. Domestically it works in partnership with a number of universities, cultural foundations, and research centres, including ICCROM, as well as the local soprintendenze and ecclesiastical bodies. Publications and Media The force maintains a database of stolen works. As of 1 March 2011, some 5,290 missing items were listed as having particular economic or cultural value. It also publishes a Bulletin of Trafficked Art Works, 2010 seeing the 32nd annual issue. Results In 2009 some 39,584 looted antiquities and 19,043 other works were recovered, valued at ‚Ç¨165 million. In 2008 works valued at ‚Ç¨183 million were recovered. Improved international collaboration, site security, and databases saw a drop of 14.5% in stolen Italian works between the two years, while the number of illegal archaeological excavations discovered fell from 238 in 2008 to 58 in 2009. In 2009 137 items relating to the Medici case were returned from Switzerland, recovered from the Zurich-based restorers Fritz Burki & Son, who had worked on the Euphronios krater. These items included statues, pottery, and a first-century AD fresco. A further 300 items were still being sought in cooperation with Swiss authorities. In 2010 a statue of Zeus was recovered that had been stolen from the Museo Nazionale Romano in 1980. The force has also been active in Iraq, surveying sites at risk, providing training, developing systems, and helping to recover 2,971 objects illicitly trafficked since 1990.

It was not until 1972 that the Cafe moved to its present location where it has become the largest and most famous fringe theater in Paris with a house that seats 450. History When it was founded, the Cafe de la Gare was called a \\"dinner theater\\", a vague term which at the time, applied mainly to a tax category. However, it was never a coffee house, and there were never any tables or chairs, only benches for about 180 people, surrounding the three sides of a stage eight meters wide and five meters deep. From the beginning the theatre was dedicated to mockery and farce. When the patrons arrived they had to draw lots determine the price of their seats. Once seated they were entitled to a drink and a cushion which the actors frequently threw in their face. Even the slogan of the theatre was brash: \\"It's ugly, it's dirty, it's going to happen\\" (C'est moche, c'est sale, c'est dans le vent.)

The western portion of the mall closed in fall 2017 for redevelopment. The eastern portion remains open. History The mall opened in 1976 as Burlington Square Mall. Its original anchor store was a Porteous department store, which later went out of business. An expansion in 1999 added the only Filene's (later Macy's) in Vermont. In 2014, L.L.Bean announced that it would be opening a store in the mall. In December 2013, Devonwood Investors, a development company led by managing partner Don Sinex, acquired the Town Center for $25 million. In November 2014, Sinex announced plans for a $200 million rebuilding of the mall, with new retail, office, and housing space, as well as a hotel and expanded parking facilities. By late 2016, Sinex and Devonwood had obtained private financing for the project, which had been split into two phases. In December, Sinex filed the majority of the permit applications for the $125 million first phase, which, subject to city approval, would build a 14-story tower on part of the property. Construction was to take place between July 2017 and January 2019, in time for the planned anchor tenant, the University of Vermont Medical Center, to take occupancy after the lease on its previous location expired.

Edwards School of Medicine is the medical school at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. It is one of three medical schools in the state of West Virginia. History The school was founded in 1977 with funding from the federal government, which also provided for a medical school at East Tennessee State University at the same time in order to address the severe shortage of physicians in central and southern Appalachia. The West Virginia Legislature appropriated funding for the school in 1975, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education granted provisional accreditation in 1977, and the first class entered in January 1978 and graduated in 1981. The school was later named for the late Joan C. Edwards the largest private contributor to the university in modern history. Undergraduate Medical Education Admission is based on scholarship, the Medical College Admissions Test, and personal qualifications as judged by interviews and recommendations. As a state-assisted medical school, Marshall gives preference to West Virginia residents. However, some positions will be available to well-qualified nonresidents from states adjoining West Virginia, nonresidents who have strong ties to West Virginia or to students who are introduced to our school through our out-of-state recruitment pipeline and outreach programs. Regardless of their state of residency, applicants are considered only if they are U.S. citizens or have permanent resident visas. The school describes itself as \\"non-traditional\\" in that it is not associated with a major research and referral hospital, and students do not take classes in a segregated single building separate from the university. Rather, its aims to educate students using the existing resources of the community and the university to the greatest extent possible. First year students mainly attend classes on-campus in the Robert C. Byrd Biotechnology Science Center (Marshall University) and also take anatomy classes and use library resources at the Robert W. Coon Medical Education Building, located seven miles from campus at the Huntington Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) Medical Center. Second year classes are held at the Erma Ora Byrd Clinical Center (opened in 2007) on the site of the former Fairfield Stadium near Cabell Huntington Hospital where the nationally recognized Forensic Science Program is also located. Third and fourth year rotations are conducted mainly at Cabell Huntington Hospital, a 303-bed hospital that is also home to the 72 bed Hoop's Family Children's Hospital as well as the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Marshall University Medical Center, which serves as the primary outpatient location for Marshall Health, in addition to St. Mary's Medical Center with 393 inpatient beds, and the Huntington V.A. Medical Center. Notably, in 2012, Cabell Huntington Hospital joined Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine and its practice plan, Marshall Health, to form an academic medical center. The primary focus of the school is educating a physician workforce for Appalachia, although students are placed in premier residency programs across the United States in primary care and subspecialties. The school also offers a Master's and Doctorate in Biomedical Sciences (and offers a joint M.D./Ph.D. program) and has recently started a joint M.D./M.P.H. program. The school currently offers residencies in 12 specialties. Under the direction of Joseph I. Shapiro, M.D., the school‚Äôs fifth dean, Marshall has continued to build on its mission of educating a physician workforce for the Appalachian region. In 2015, the school enrolled its first class into the newly created BS/MD program for West Virginia students, which allows them to complete their bachelor‚Äôs and medical degrees in seven years. Graduate Medical Education also expanded in recent years to include residencies in psychiatry, dentistry, and neurology and fellowships in sports medicine (family and community health), nephrology, hematology-oncology, child and adolescent psychiatry, and geriatric psychiatry. Notably, on May 1, 2018, Cabell Huntington Hospital completed the final steps to acquire St. Mary's Medical Center that increases the size of the academic hospital system to 696 inpatient beds between the two hospitals. Graduate Medical Education Fully accredited residencies, internships, and fellowships at Marshall include: Residencies: * Psychiatry Residency * Family Medicine Residency * Internal Medicine Residency * Medicine-Pediatrics Residency * Pediatrics Residency * Neurology Residency * Obstetrics and Gynecology Residency * Orthopedics Residency * General Surgery Residency * General Practice Residency - Dental Fellowships: * Sports Medicine * Cardiology * Endocrinology * Interventional Cardiology * Hematology and Oncology * Nephrology * Pulmonology * Child and Adolescent Psychiatry * Geriatric Psychiatry  Accreditation  In June 2011, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) placed the School of Medicine on probation for not meeting nine standards in areas including a lack of diversity for students and faculty, lower-than-average scholarship support and higher-than-average student debt, limited programs to promote student well-being, limited advising, lack of a financial aid and debt management program, and curricular issues. The probation was lifted in 2013, after the administrators of the school demonstrated progress to the LCME, and the school was again fully accredited. The school was accredited for 8 years in 2019.

Bash≈ç tells of his visit to the site in Oku no Hosomichi. The ruins of Taga-j≈ç and its former temple have been designated a since 1922. History In the Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsury≈ç system, the Yamato court sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. In what is now Miyagi Prefecture, a civil administration was established in the form of a provincial capital and regional administrative centers in the late 6th century; however, a massive Emishi uprising occurred in 709 AD during which time many of these structures were destroyed. Per the Shoku Nihongi, following a huge earthquake in the year 715 AD, a large number of people migrated to this area from the southern Kant≈ç region, forming numerous fortified settlements in the hinterland. An inscription on a monument found at the site of Taga Castle gives a foundation date of 724 AD and states that it was constructed by Azumabito Ono as the provisional provincial capital of Mutsu Province. Along with Akita Castle and Okachi Fort in Dewa Province, it was one of the main bases for the Yamato re-expansion into northern Honshu. Its commander was titled and was the northern equivalent to the commander of in Kyushu. The castle was significantly renovated by Fujiwara Asakari in 762 AD. Taga Castle was rebuilt after being sacked and burned by the Emishi in 780 AD. From 802 AD, the frontier between Yamato and Emishi territories shifted further north due to the successful campaigns of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, and with the construction of Isawa Castle, Taga Castle gradually lost importance. It was retained as a center for administrative functions, but most military activities were transferred to various northern strongholds. It was badly damaged by the J≈çgan tsunami of 869. In 10th century, due to the collapse of ancient administrative system and rise of local samurai bands, the central government abandoned direct rule in favor of a feudal system of local warlords nominally under the control of various nobles in Kyoto. Taga Caste gradually fell into ruins, and rise of Hiraizumi under the Northern Fujiwara in the twelfth century saw its final demise. During the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, Kitabatake Chikafusa and his son Kitabatake Akiie briefly occupied the site for the Southern Court, but later moved to the more secure mountain fortress of Mount Ry≈çzen to the north. The site reverted to empty fields, and was not excavated until 1955, with more extensive investigations in 1976. Description Taga Castle is more of a fortified city than a military stronghold. It is located located on a plateau 10 kilometer northeast of Sendai city near the Pacific coast. This area is a hill country which divides the Sendai Plain into half and which was close to Shiogama, a natural port which was also used during this era. The site was surrounded by a marsh and rivers, making it an appropriate place for defense. The fortification was a square enclosure, approximately 3.4 kilometers in perimeter, consisting of a 5-meter high earthen rampart surmounted by a wooden palisade, and protected by a 3-4 meter wide dry moat. The east side of the castle facing the connecting hills was especially well-protected, and an east side gate was built inside of hollow of the wall guarded by corner turret. Within the fortified main gate in the south was a main road of over 20 meters in width leading to a second square enclosure, 100 meter square, also with earthen walls. The outer area contained administrative offices, barracks and the residences of officers, while the inner area contained the higher government administrative buildings, workshops and storehouses. About a kilometer south of the Taga Castle ruins are the ruins of a large Buddhist temple complex, and outside the southern wall of the castle are the ruins of a planned settlement. The site today is maintained as an archaeological park. Taga Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.

It is one of ten short stories in the collection Tsutsumi Ch≈´nagon Monogatari. Story The protagonist befriends insects, names her attendants after them, and engages in poetic exchanges involving furry caterpillars, leading to laughter on the part of others. Portrayed as even more eccentric is her disregard for her physical appearance: she leaves her hair untrimmed; has unplucked eyebrows; neglects to blacken her teeth; and allows herself to be seen by men. 'Oh, how regrettable! Why does she have such a weird mind'. When an incipient love affair comes to an end along with the tale it is of little surprise to any of the observers. Interpretation Donald Keene has suggested that, while the reader may be attracted by her independence of mind, the author was probably trying to satirize those with eccentric behaviour and unconventional tastes. Robert Backus argues that the modern reader may prefer her independence and naturalness to the \\"excessive artificiality of the Heian conception of feminine beauty\\". He also draws parallels with the vernacular setsuwa tradition and anecdotes told of Fujiwara Munesuke, the bee-keeping minister, who gave his favourites names such as , , and . Michele Marra also refers to Fujiwara Munesuke, again links the tale with setsuwa that similarly challenge court orthodoxy, and suggests that the story may see Buddhist truth preferred to the values of the Fujiwara aristocracy at the end of the Heian period.

It is set in an alternate version of the American Wild West in which the Far West reaches of the world are untamed and still being created. It tells the story of Liv Alverhuysen, a female psychologist who sets off on an adventure to heal the mad and John Creedmoor, an Agent of the Gun who is goaded into obedience to his master's orders, despite his growing disdain for them. The novel pits two rival factions against each other as they each hunt for a way to end the everlasting war between them. The Line is industrial, with technological weapons and trains that speed by so quickly the countryside is barely seen and take over towns and make their citizens slaves at their whim. The Gun are made up of thieves and murderers and keep hold of the people by fear and violence, but they are losing the war against the Line. The book was nominated for a 2011 Locus Award.http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Locus2011.html Prologue The book begins by telling the story of how the General falls prey to one of the Line's noisemaker devises, something that drives the listener mad if it does not kill them outright. As he lies immobile on the ground, Linesmen walk among the dead and wounded, slaying any still alive. One lazy Lineman leaves the General alive because he does not want to spare the effort to bend over to slit his throat. Plot summary The reader is introduced to the character of Dr. Lysvet 'Liv' Alverhuysen at the Koenigswald Academy, where she has taught for years. A letter has come for her dead husband, a plea to come west to the edge of the world and the House of Dolorous, a hospital who takes in all wounded, regardless of which side of the war they were injured on. She begins her difficult journey with the help of the school janitor, a brain damaged but extremely large man who wants nothing more than to protect her. John Creedmore is relaxing on a ferryboat, enjoying being out of the war, when his masters, the Gun, summon him to take on a new mission. He is to go to the House of Dolorous and retrieve (but not kill) an old man believe to have secrets of a great weapon from the First Folk, wild people who live in the hills, that can kill the Line engines, which are the alternate version of the Gun. Down the Line, Lowry is tasked with the same mission. He goes about it in the opposite way from Creedmoor, as an army is essentially brought in to support him. Creedmoor, having continued to ride through the death of several horses, reaching the town of Kloan and decides he needs a break, contrary to his master's wishes. They reluctantly concede and he wanders through the town looking for entertainment. Instead, soldiers of the Line recognize him and the town is turned into an all-out battleground as Creedmoor escapes. Lowry and his support men flood the town hours afterward, but they are too late. Instead, they set up an outpost and prepare to wait until Creedmoor attempts to leave with the General. Creedmoor tricks his way into the House of Dolorous because his usual method of killing is impossible in the House, which is protected by a guardian who will kill anyone who kills. Liv arrives at the same time, after a difficult journey. She unwittingly picks the General as one of her two psychology subjects to study and attempt to cure, and when Creedmore springs his trap, distracting the guardian with the pain and suffering of all the patients at once, she is carried along with the General as they head west, the only place where they can escape the Line. The soldier of the Line follow, but the going is much rougher for them in the wild west, because they are dependent upon their technology which has not yet stretched this far. Afraid of any type of failure, Lowry presses on as his soldiers dwindle. Liv and the General are discovered by what is left of the Red Valley Republic, who had moved as far west as they could years ago with their General's defeat. They call their town New Design. Creedmore has gone off to try to slay a dragon-like creature for the thrill of the hunt. His masters' voices come and go now and he sometimes thinks disloyal thoughts about them, which they note upon their return. They threaten to harm him, but he laughs it off, knowing he is the only one they have out here with the General. Liv and the General are made welcome in the New Design, but Liv cannot shake off how ill-prepared the town is, even as she warns them the Line is coming. The Line comes. The town fights, but falters until Creedmoor decides to throw in his hand and save most of them. During the mop up, he takes the General and Liv follows. The six remaining men of the Line follow. Liv senses that Creedmoor's masters will not allow him to act in his own accord, and when she gets her chance, she stabs him repeatedly with her knife, even as he heals. She causes enough damage that the Linesmen catch up to a broken Creedmoor and are able to subdue him, and they blow up his Gun, which has tied him to his masters for so many years. Once the Gun is destroyed, Liv steps forward and kills the two remaining Linesmen. The General had been shot when Liv first attacked Creedmoor, and he tells them his dying story of where he had been going to find the weapon. Creedmoor is still tied up, but Liv cannot decide if she will free him or let him die for his crimes committed at whim of the Gun. She eventually frees him. Epilogue The Engines believe that Lowry has failed and are afraid of what will come out of the west. A tracker and Agent of the Gun named Knoll is sent after Creedmoor, who the Gun know has not died. New Design starts to be rebuilt as New New Design. The Academy holds a funeral for Liv upon receiving a letter from the House about her kidnapping and presumed death.

Originally published in Cerebus #114-136, the storyline continues in the wake of the events of \\"Church and State\\" and the conquest of the city of Iest by the fascist matriarchal Cirinists. The story focuses on Cerebus, his longtime love interest Jaka, Jaka's husband Rick, Oscar (a stand- in for the real life Oscar Wilde), and Jaka's employer Pud (a tavern owner who employs Jaka) as they struggle against the repressive fascist regime of the Cirinists. In particular, the free spirited Jaka defies the Cirinist ban on dancing, which leads to ruin for Rick, Jaka, and Cerebus. The book flashes back and forth between Jaka's lonely, aristocratic childhood up to her twelfth birthday, and the \\"present\\" time of the main Cerebus storyline. The \\"present\\" sections are told in comics form while the \\"past\\" portions are told in flowery prose sections, which the reader finds out later are written by Oscar (and are in Sim's imitation of Wilde's writing style), unknown to Jaka and based on what Oscar has heard from Rick. Overview The story alternates between \\"the present\\" in regular comics pages (mostly done in a six-panel grid) and \\"the past\\" in illustrated text passages. Cerebus' character remains mostly in the background, and doesn't even appear in most of the second half of the book. The overblown prose of the text passages, the reader discovers later, were written by Jaka and Rick's artistic neighbour Oscar (a caricature of Oscar Wilde). It tells the tale of Jaka's childhood and aristocratic origins as she is brought up in her uncle Lord Julius' household with an overbearing Nurse, as interpreted by Oscar from stories he has heard from Rick. Nurse's face is never seenoften it is replaced with the face of Jaka's doll, Missy). The story is told with a limited number of people and locations, creating a confined, claustrophobic feeling. Much of the novel is spent developing the characters, and Cerebus himself takes a back-seat role. Synopsis=Prologue (Cerebus #114) Jaka goes about her morning, waking her husband Rick and preparing the bath and his breakfast, and irritatedly prodding him to go find work in the Lower City. Parallel to this, in the prose sections, we see Jaka as a lonely child, also going about her morning, being watched over by her imposing Nurse. Her only friend was her doll, Missy. Together, they are taken to visit a park in which she plays on a wooden horse called Thunder, but which in her imagination is called Magic. The reader finds out that Missy is still with Jaka in the \\"present\\", sitting on her shelf, watching over her, as if protecting her. Book One: Pogrom's Progress (Cerebus #115‚Äì119) Cerebus, on his way down towards the Lower City, comes across a tavern run by Pud Withers. Cerebus tries to order an ale, but Pud panics when Cerebus tries to pay with a gold coin‚Äîcertain indenture laws have sent the price of gold \\"through the roof\\". Jaka walks in and, seeing that Cerebus is still alive, she embraces him and invites him to stay at her home. Cerebus learns that Jaka has had a miscarriage, and meets Rick. After staying for some time, Cerebus announces to Jaka that he will not leave without her. Rick overhears the conversation between Jaka and Cerebus and realizes that their guest had formerly been the Pope. Cerebus stays, witnessing Jaka and Rick's fights and make-up love-makings through the walls. Jaka works for Pud as a dancer in the evenings, though she feels \\"useless\\" that she has drawn no customers. She also seem unaware of Pud's lusting for herhe plays out fantasy conversations with her in his mindor the fact that he's ruining himself financially over her. During the text sections, we follow Jaka's lonely childhood, as she hits her head on Magic and is left bedridden; and as she finds a hidden room in the house. Book Two: The Poet (Cerebus #120‚Äì130) Oscar, Jaka and Rick's next-door neighbour (and a caricature of Oscar Wilde) return from the Upper City. Rick is enamoured of Oscar, who is vain, rude and arrogant. Rick tells Oscar that he wants to have a son, and that he will give his son a foal when he turns 10. He'll have his son lift it over his head every day until he turns 13, at which point he'll be able to lift a full-grown horse, and not be skinny and weak like Rick himself. Rick accidentally lets Oscar know of their houseguest, before quickly remembering that Cerebus had been the Pope and was in hiding. He covers up by calling Cerebus \\"Fred\\" and claiming he is Jaka's brother. Jaka and Pud both dislike Oscar. Pud makes no effort to disguise his dislike; however, as landlord, must allow him to stay, as his dead mother had given Oscar a 90-year lease on his house. Jaka returns home excitedly one night after having her first customer at Pud's tavern, an old veteran. The news is stifled by Rick and \\"Fred\\", who are in the middle of a game, and Jaka goes to her room in tears. Rick follows, and the two fight, partly over Rick's insistence that he will go to the Lower City to fetch paint for Oscar. \\"Fred\\" overhears, and in the morning leaves a note saying that he will go to the Lower City for the paint. Oscar lets Rick know that he has completed a bookthe very book that the reader has been reading between the comics. Oscar lets Jaka know through Rick, and has himself invited to see Jaka dance. Jaka's curiosity is piqued and she consents. She dances for Oscar, Rick, Pud and the veteran. Oscar then excuses himself to get the manuscript of the book, and while he is gone, Rick lets her know that it is about her childhood. Jaka is mortifiedshe can't believe Rick would tell such private things to Oscar. Before Oscar can return, the tavern is discovered and invaded by Cirinists. Exotic dancing is illegal in Cirinist-run Iest, and Jaka is arrested. Pud and the veteran are killed. Oscar returns, but assures the Cirinsts that he was not a patron. They arrest him, instead, for writing a book without having an \\"artistic license\\", and sentence him to two years hard labour. Book Three: Mystery Achievement (Cerebus #131‚Äì136) Jaka is imprisoned by the Cirinists for the felony of being an exotic dancer. In the prison, she finds out that her neighbour in the next cell is Nurse, who is to be executed for lacking the proper immigration papers. Jaka is treated harshly by the prison guard, and is led to believe that Rick is dead. We are introduced to Mrs. Thatcher, a caricature of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, a matriarch who tries to show Jaka what exotic dancing \\"really was\\", as opposed to what Jaka believed it to be. She is allowed to return to Palnu on the condition that she sign an admission of wrongdoing. Under pressure, she signs, whereupon she is told that Rick is still alive and they are to be reunited. When they are brought together, however, Mrs. Thatcher reveals to Rick that the Cirinists knew that Jaka had had an abortion, not a miscarriage. Rick explodes and strikes Jaka. The two are allowed to separate, with Rick being returned to his mother, but not before having his left thumb broken for \\"striking a woman\\". At the end, \\"Fred\\" returns with the paint, only to find the houses burnt out and the inhabitants gone. Epilogue (from second half of Cerebus #138) Jaka spends her time in the suite in Palnu where she had spent her last year before running away. The servants gossip, while Jaka, who barely eats or drinks, stares vacantly out a window. Characters ;Jaka Nash (n√©e Tavers):Married to Rick and pregnant by him, Jaka is now dancing at Pud's tavern in exchange for just enough money to cover rent and groceries, which are provided by Pud. While she had been pregnant the last time she and Cerebus met, she tells Cerebus she has had a miscarriage. Later, it is revealed that she had actually had an illegal abortion. In a 1994 interview (around the time the anti-feminist Cerebus #186 was published), Sim claimed he wrote Jaka as a nuanced, sympathetic character only as a \\"writing exercise\\", the point of which was to build her up in the readers' minds and then tear her down at the end of the story, although in the past Sim had written that Jaka was someone he would actually like to hang out with. Jaka was ranked 55th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. ;Nurse:Jaka's governess in the prose sections of the book; stern and overbearing. Her real name is Ada Talbot. ;Rick Nash:Jaka's unemployed husband; slack, immature but likeable. He desperately wants a son. He also enjoys hanging around with Oscar and helping him out, though Jaka considers Oscar a bad influence. In the introduction to the Jaka's Story phonebook, Sim dispels the idea that Rick was based on himself. He goes on to say that Rick is most likely the only instance of a truly good character he has ever created. ;Pud Withers:Store- and tavern-owner; Jaka and Rick's landlord; Jaka's employer at the tavern. He secretly pines after Jaka, but is too shy wo do anything about it. The reader is privy through inner monologue to the fantasy conversations he imagines having with Jaka. ;Cerebus:Jaka and Rick's house guest, hiding from the Cirinists under the assumed name of \\"Fred\\" ;Oscar:Caricature of Oscar Wilde; Jaka and Rick's next-door neighbour. A writer who is vain and arrogant aristophile. He was granted a 90-year lease on the house he lives in by Pud's dead mother. Pud himself, however, despises Oscar. ;Mrs. Thatcher:A matriarch based on Margaret Thatcher, she tries to get Jaka to sign an admission of guilt for her exotic dancing, and tries, forcefully, to convince her why such dancing is wrong. Style Gerhard prior to starting the book The pages of the \\"present\\" portions of the book were done in six panel grids, two tiers of three panels. This was done with little variation, although sometimes the shape of the panels was distorted, reflecting tensions occurring within the panels. Mrs Thatcher's distinct melodramatic and rhythmic speech balloons The characters were more realistic and less exhibited less caricatured exaggeration than in earlier Cerebus stories. The backgrounds were particularly realistic. As this was the first Cerebus \\"novel\\" that Gerhard participated in from the beginning, he had the luxury of being able to plan out the rooms of the houses ahead of time. They were based on Sim's memory, as described to Gerhard, of the apartment Sim and his then-wife Deni had first shared. Gerhard spent about a month completing floor plans and 3D views of the buildings in the story before any pages were actually drawn, and Sim wrote the scenes of the story to suit these plans. Of particular interest is Sim's award-winning, expressive use of lettering and speech balloons, especially the exaggerated rhythms and intonation used for Mrs. Thatcher's dialogue. Publication history Instalment numbers of Jaka's Story were displayed prominently on the covers of Cerebus the Aardvark along with issue numbers Originally published in issues #114‚Äì136 of Sim's monthly Cerebus series from August 1988 to July 1990, Jaka's Story was published as a trade paperback \\"phone book\\" collection in October 1990. Sim had briefly toyed with the idea of publishing expensive, high-quality, oversized editions of Jaka's Story, but soon decided against it for being too greedy. The first printing, October 1990, was limited to 435 signed (by both Dave Sim and Gerhard) and numbered copies (hand written on inside title page), . Jaka's Story was the first Cerebus novel to be conceived with the finished graphic novel collection in mind. When serialized, it prominently displayed the novel name (Jaka's Story) on the cover, and printed both the current issue of the series and the current issue of the novelso, for example, the January 1989 issue was numbered both Cerebus #119 and Jaka's Story #6. Sim says he was influenced by Love and Rockets to do a \\"more human\\" story. The novel was sandwiched between two issues (the #112/113 double issue and #137) that have not been collected in the series of \\"phone book\\" collections. Issues #137 and #138 were subtitled \\"Jaka's Story: Epilogue\\" 1 and 2 and their covers. The second half of issue #138 was included in the Jaka's Story collection as the epilogue, but the story that made up the rest of the two issues (\\"Like-a-Looks\\", see below) was not included in the Jaka's Story collection. Like-a-Looks In issue #137 and the first half of #138 ran the story \\"Like-a-Looks\\"a light-hearted, comedic story about the numerous doppelg√§ngers Lord Julius would hire to stand in his place when he needed a break. The story has never been included in any \\"phonebook\\" collection. It has, however, been included in Cerebus Number Zero, which collects all the stories from the regular Cerebus series that didn't appear in the phonebooks. Reception=Recognition Jaka's Story has been said to be Sim's peak work and the best introduction to Cerebus (although others says High Society is the best introduction). In 1990, it was nominated for a Harvey Award for \\"Best Single Issue or Story\\". It was included in Stephen Weiner's book The 101 Best Graphic Novels in 2001. Reappraisal Though for years, the series was considered by Sim as one of is proudest works, but in recent time Sims has spoken negatively of the work. In particular, Sim has stated that Jaka's actions in the story were selfish and that the unhappy ending was not a commentary on censorship and fascist behavior of totalitarian regimes, but a commentary on Jaka's selfish nature towards not caring that her dancing would lead to harm done to those around her.

She is the creator and executive producer of the show Simply Complicated on the platform Yandex.Efir, Russia's equivalent of Google. She is the host of SophieCo Visionaries, and between 2006 and 2015 she was a presenter on the radio station Echo of Moscow.  Biography  Sophie Shevardnadze was born on 23 September 1978 in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. She studied in Tbilisi until the 8th grade at public school No 55 and developed an early passion for dance and music, learning the piano and taking up ballet. Much of her childhood coincided with the fall of the Soviet Union. Due to having career politicians in the family, her late grandfather being the last foreign minister of the USSR and leader of Georgia, Sophie was one of few within the bloc that could travel at the time. She often moved between Moscow and Tbilisi until the age of 10, before eventually going to Paris where her father worked in the diplomatic service. It was a turbulent time for many at the end of the 90s and Sophie had to adapt quickly, not knowing either French or English language. She graduated from √âcole Active Bilingue and the Conservatoire International de Musique de Paris with double qualifications from the British and French Educational systems with top grades. When she was just 17, Sophie entered the Social Communications Department at Boston University, a year earlier than most of her peers, and later transferred in her second year to Emerson College to focus on a major in Cinema Studies. She graduated from the Bachelor's programme with honors. Sophie continued her post-graduate studies in TV journalism at New York University, where she also achieved honors. During her college years, she took a hands-on approach to journalism by completing an internship as a producer for the channel ABC. This shaped a lot of early influences in her media career, and she says the late anchor Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters as interviewers inspired her.  Family  Father ‚Äî Paata Shevardnadze, Doctor of Philological Science in the USSR, author of philological and philosophical studies, international diplomat, worked as a career diplomat with UNESCO for 20 years. Mother ‚Äî Nina Akhvlediani, philologist, English language specialist, literary translator from French and English into Georgian. Brother ‚Äî Lasha Shevardnadze, entrepreneur. Sisters ‚Äî Mariam and Nanuli Shevardnadze. Nanuli is a graduate of New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Grandfather ‚Äî Eduard Shevardnadze, Soviet and Georgian politician. The USSR's last Minister of Foreign Affairs and the second President of Georgia. In Sophie's teenage years, she attended a number of high-level meetings along with her grandfather. Eduard Shevardnadze is credited by many as someone who had a huge influence on ending the Cold War and paving the way for modern Georgia.

Other  Shevardnadze prides herself on having worked for a number of different media networks which cross all political divides. She is a firm believer that one of the best ways to deliver the truth to viewers is through interviews, giving the blunt views of guests and challenging them on key ideas and opinions.

It provides a methodological approach to the conservation of cultural heritage sites in China. Background While sustained debate on approaches to conservation dates from the nineteenth century, only in the mid-twentieth century were the first international and national conservation charters drawn up. In China, the development of modern conservation concepts and practice began in the 1930s. In 1950 the People's Republic of China began a national inventory and assessment of the significance of its cultural sites. As of 2004, over 400,000 heritage sites had been identified nationwide, with over 1,230 listed as being of national importance. In 1982 the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Cultural Relics, consolidating previous legislation, entrusted primary responsibility for the conservation of cultural heritage to the government, while regulating the actions of conservation professionals. In 1985 China ratified the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. In May 1997 SACH requested that the Getty Conservation Institute assist in drawing up China's first conservation charter, with the Burra Charter proposed as a model. A tripartite project with the Australian Heritage Commission was launched in October 1997. By involving foreign parties as well as drawing upon domestic experience, it was intended that international best practice should guide local heritage practitioners. The Preface to the China Principles states 'China's magnificent sites are the heritage not only of the various ethnic groups in China but are also the common wealth of all humanity ‚Ä¶ it is the responsibility of all to bequeath these sites to future generations in their full integrity and authenticity. Economic development, mass tourism, globalization, and national interests have all affected the country's historic legacy. Promulgation and publication The 38 articles of the China Principles, with accompanying commentary, were promulgated by China ICOMOS in late 2000 with the approval of SACH. The principles are grouped into five chapters: (1) General Principles; (2) The Conservation Process; (3) Conservation Principles; (4) Conservation Interventions; and (5) Additional Principles. An English-language translation was first published in July 2002 and a bilingual version with a Chinese-English and English-Chinese glossary was published in May 2004. It is recognised that, as use of the guidelines reveals the need for change, the Principles will be revised. A planned further document is to comprise illustrated examples of successful conservation measures. The 38 Articles :(1) Definition of heritage sites :(2) Conservation to include both intervention and preventive measures :(3) Heritage values :(4) Benefit of society not short-term gain :(5) Conservation to comply with laws, regulations and standards; significance is the highest priority throughout :(6) Research :(7) Documentation :(8) Management and training :(9) Conservation process :(10) Survey and inventory :(11) Assessment of values, condition and management :(12) Listing and buffer zones :(13) Conservation plans :(14) Actions plans for conservation, interpretation and education :(15) Periodic review of conservation plans :(16) Peer review of conservation plans :(17) Day-to-day management :(18) Conservation in-situ :(19) Minimum intervention :(20) Maintenance programme :(21) Intervention must be reversible, 'unobtrusive' yet 'distinguishable', and disclosed to the public :(22) Conservation techniques and materials must be proven :(23) Aesthetic criteria, derived from historic authenticity :(24) Landscape and setting :(25) No reconstruction, except in special cases :(26) Excavation entails conservation :(27) Disaster plans :(28) Intervention should have clear objectives, use proven methods and materials, and be documented :(29) Regular maintenance :(30) Physical protection :(31) Minor restoration :(32) Any restoration should preserve traces of periods of significance :(33) No conjectural reconstruction :(34) Treatment of setting and landscaping should not adversely affect site :(35) Archaeological sites should typically be reburied to conserve and prevent theft :(36) Principles may also be applied to commemorative places :(37) Principles may also be drawn upon for cultural, historic, and submarine landscapes and historic cities :(38) Principles drafted and adopted by China ICOMOS and approved by SACH; amendments should follow similarly.

The school is an educational institution teaching in the Roman Catholic Tradition; its curriculum focuses on the impact of church culture and how it shaped the western world, and includes both classic and traditional liberal arts courses. Though the school is independent of the administrative jurisdiction of the Diocese of Syracuse, it was established with and operates under the blessing of the diocesan bishop, and is registered with the New York State Department of Education. The school has won numerous awards for excellence for its Catholic curriculum, athletics and musical departments (,).  Mission statement  ‚ÄúHoly Cross Academy exists to support and assist parents ‚Äî the primary educators of their children ‚Äî in the education and formation of the students, and to help students on the journey to their proper end: Heaven‚Äù.  History = Founding  The idea for the high school was born in 1995. It was then that a group of local Roman Catholic parents met to discuss the need for a Catholic high school in the county. Many of the families involved were affiliated with local homeschooling organizations or had children registered at the local diocesan elementary school. They wanted a Catholic school established as an option for secondary schooling in the area. Though the Diocese of Syracuse encompasses seven counties, it was home to only five diocesan Junior/Senior high schools, none in Madison county and all beyond standard busing routes. Plans for the founding of a new school began soon after the meeting, and Holy Cross Academy was incorporated in 1996 and open to students in 1997.  Locations  Holy Cross Academy has operated in three locations. The first was in a two-classroom schoolhouse on the property of Holy Cross Church in New London, New York (for which the school was named). After seeing substantial growth in enrollment, the academy moved to the parish center of St. Joseph Church in Oneida). In 2002, the academy made a permanent move to its first self-owned location after purchasing a former church facility on Barrington Road in Oneida. Since the purchase, the school has made several expansions, including the addition of extra classrooms and full-sized soccer and softball fields. Plans for substantial future renovations and additions have also been drawn. Holy Cross Academy became a member of NAPCIS (National Association for Catholic and Independent Schools) in 2003.

This also means creating a work schedule that does not lead to emotional and physical distress.  Overview  Positive psychology in the workplace is about shifting attention away from negative aspects such as work violence, stress, burnout, and job insecurity. Through the employment of positive psychology, a working environment with a goal of promoting positive affect in its employees can be created. Fun should not be looked at as something that cannot be achieved during work but rather as a motivation factor for the staff. However, the type of fun in the workplace needs to be considered by the manager. Depending on the learning types of their employees, it is not always productive depending on the personalities of their employees. Along this line, it is important to examine the role of: helping behaviors, team building exercises, job resources, job security and work support. The emerging field of positive psychology also helps to creatively manage organizational behaviors and to increase productivity in the workplace through applying positive organizational forces.Andrew J. Martin,\\"The Role of Positive Psychology in Enhancing Satisfaction, Motivation, and Productivity in the Workplace\\", University of Western Sydney, 2005 Recent researches on job satisfaction and employee retention have created a great need to focus on implementing positive psychology in the workplace. Background According to the United States Department of Labor, ‚ÄúIn 2009, employed persons worked an average of 7.5 hours on the days they worked, which were mostly weekdays. [In addition to that], 84 percent of employed persons did some or all of their work at their workplace.[1]‚Äù United States Department of Labor Bureau of Statistics.‚ÄùAmerican Time Use Survey‚Äù. June 2010. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm This indicates that majority of the population spend their waking hours at work, outside their homes. Therefore, employers must do their best to create a low stress and inspiring work environment to yield greater productivity. Michelle T. Iaffaldano and Paul M. Muchinsky were among the first people to ignite interest in the connection between job satisfaction and job performance. The meta-analytic research of these individuals impacted the way in which later research on the topic was conducted, especially regarding sample sizes.Iaffaldano M.T., & Muchinsky P.M (1985). Job satisfaction and job performance: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 97, 251-273 .  Major theoretical approaches  Martin E.P. Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi are noted frontrunners in the area of positive psychology as a field of study. They state that ‚Äúpsychology has become a science largely about healing. Therefore its concentration on healing largely neglects the fulfilled individual and thriving community‚Äù.Seligman, M. E. P., & Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). Positive psychology: An introduction. American Psychologist, 55, 5‚Äì14. Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi further stress that, ‚Äúthe aim of positive psychology is to begin to catalyze a change in the focus of psychology from preoccupation only with repairing the worst things in life to also building positive qualities.‚Äù Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers developed Humanistic Psychology that focuses on the positive potential of people and on helping people reach their full potential.Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology: The evolution of a science. Psychology (p. 1.10). New York: Worth Publishers. Peter Warr is noted for his early work on work well being. ‚ÄúProponents of the well-being perspective argue that the presence of positive emotional states and positive appraisals of the worker and his or her relationships within the workplace accentuate worker performance and quality of life‚Äù.Harter, J., Schmidt, F., & Keyes, C. 2003. Well-being in the workplace and its relationship to business outcomes: A review of the Gallup studies. In C. Keyes & J. Haidt (eds.), Flourishing: Positive psychology and the life well-lived: 205-224. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. A common idea in work environment theories is that demands match or slightly exceed the resources. With regards to research concerning positive outcomes within the employment setting, several models have been established like Demand Control, Job Demands-Resources, and Job Characteristics. Demand control model Robert A. Karasek is credited with this particular work design model. In Karasek‚Äôs model, workplace stress is in indicator of how taxing a worker's job is and how much control, authority, discretion, and decision latitude the worker has over his/her tasks and duties. This creates four kinds of jobs‚Äîpassive, active, low strain and high strain The Demand Control Model (DCM) has been used by researchers to design jobs that enhance the psychological and physical well-being.Turner N., Barling J., & Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715‚Äì728). New York: Oxford University Press. This model promotes a work design that proposes high demand and high control, fostering an environment that encourages learning and simultaneously offers autonomy. This model is based on the assumption that ‚Äúworkers with active jobs are more likely to seek challenging situations that promote mastery, thereby encouraging skill and knowledge acquisition‚Äù.Turner N., Barling J., & Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715‚Äì728). New York: Oxford University Press. It also points out the role of social support, referring to the quality interactions between colleagues and managers.Ruckenbiel J. (2013).Gesundheit, Arbeit und Zusammenhalt (pp. 93-122).Freiburg: Centaurus Verlag. However, there is some controversy over this model because some researchers Toon W. Taris (2006). Bricks without clay: On urban myths in occupational health psychology. Work & Stress Vol. 20, Iss. 2.. believe it lacks evidence for the interaction between demand and control. The DCM is commonly criticized for its inability to consistently replicate findings to support its basic assumption. The DCM has been criticized for ‚Äúits simplicity, inability to capture the complexity of work environments.However, there is evidence supporting the idea that ‚Äúhigh amounts of job control is associated with increases in job satisfaction and decreased depression, however, high demands with out adequate control may lead to increase anxiety‚Äù. Job demands-resources The job demands-resources model (JD-R) is an expansion of the DCM and is founded on the same principle that high job demands and high job resources produce employees with more positive work attitudes. The difference between the JD-R and DCM is that the JD-R expounds upon the differentiation between demand and resources, as well as encompasses a broader view of resources. This model refers to demands as ‚Äú those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort.Bakker, A. (2010). Psychosocial safety climate as a precursor to conducive work environments, psychological health problems, and employee engagement. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83(3), 795-814. This may refer to jobs that require contact with customers. Resources are regarded as ‚Äúthose physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either/or: (1) functional in achieving work goals; (2) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs; and (3) stimulate personal growth, learning, and development‚Äù. Another difference between these two theories is that the JD-R postulates that resources can be predictors of motivation and learning related outcomes. The findings by Bakker and colleagues supports their hypothesis that many resources may be linked to job well-being. They also found that ‚Äútask enjoyment and organizational commitment are the result of combinations of many different job demands and job resources. Enjoyment and commitment were high when employees were confronted with challenging and stimulating tasks, and simultaneously had sufficient resources at their disposal‚Äù. Job characteristics model The job characteristics model (JCM) is ‚Äúan influential theory of work design developed by Hackman and Oldham. It is based upon five characteristics - skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback - which are used to identify the general content and structure of jobs‚Äù. This model argues that employees with a personal need for growth and development, as well as knowledge and skill, will display more positive work outcomes. These include things such as: job satisfaction, lower absenteeism, and better work turnover. This model is based upon an idea that high task control and feedback are two essential elements for maximizing work potential. Stronger experiences of these five traits is said to lead to greater job satisfaction and better performance. Empirical evidence=Safety In order to protect the physical and mental health of workers, the demands of the job must be balanced by easily accessible job resources in order to prevent burnout in employees yet encourage employee engagement.Nahrgang, J.D., Morgeson, F.P., & Hofman, D.A. (2011). Safety at work: A meta-analytic investigation of the link between job demands, job resources, burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96(1), 71-94 Engagement signifies a positive employee who is committed to the safety within the workplace for self and others. In contrast, burnout represents a negative employee possessing elements of anxiety, depression, and work-related stress. Engagement increases as job resources like knowledge of safety are present. On the other hand, burnout increases when more job demands are present without the buffering effects of job resources. Hazards in the workplace can be seen as a combination of the physical demands of the work and the complexity of the work. Job resources provide a buffering effect that protects the employees from job demands like high work pressure, an unfavorable physical environment, and emotionally demanding interactions.Nahrgang, J.D., Morgeson, F.P., & Hofman, D.A. (2011). Safety at work: A meta-analytic investigation of the link between job demands, job resources, burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96(1), 71-94. Employees are better equipped to handle changes in their work environment when resources are readily available.Wanberg, C. R., & Banas, J. T. (2000). Predictors and outcomes of openness to changes in a reorganizing workplace. Journal of Applied Psychology, 85: 132-142. The resources a job can provide include autonomy, support, and knowledge of safety. Autonomy allows employees the freedom to decide how to execute their work. Support can originate directly from a supervisor or from other workers in the environment. And lastly, employees must have knowledge about safety procedures and policies. When the employee is able to work in a safe environment, workers are more satisfied with their jobs. A safe environment provides support and resources that promote healthy employees. Emotion, attitude and mood Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, and interpret emotions that can be used to regulate emotions and assist cognitive processes which promote emotional and intellectual growth.Mayer, J. D., Salovey, P., & Caruso, D. R. (2004). Emotional intelligence: Theory, findings, and implications. Psychological Inquiry, 15, 197‚Äì215. Emotional intelligence has been researched by Carmelli (2003) in order to see its effect on employees work performance.Carmelli, A. (2003). The relationship between emotional intelligence and work attitudes, behavior and outcomes. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 18, 788‚Äì813. Due to the social nature of the interactions of the employees, emotional intelligence is essential in order to work well with co- workers. When employees work well together their task performance improves and as a result the business benefits. With emotional intelligence, employees are better able to perceive others needing help and are more willing to help for intrinsic benefits. Isen & Reeve (2005) proposed that positive affect led to positive intrinsic motivation for completing a task.Isen, A. M., & Reeve, J. (2005). The influence of positive affect on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: Facilitating enjoyment of play, responsible work behavior, and self-control. Motivation and Emotion, 29, 295‚Äì323. As a result of the intrinsic motivation, the employees enjoyed the task more and were more optimistic when having to complete more uninteresting task. The combination of having the freedom to choose tasks and maintaining positive affect results in better task performance. Positive affect promotes self-control to remain focused on any task and forward-looking thinking that motivates workers to look-forward to more enjoyable tasks. Concepts of positive psychology like hope and altruism provide a positive work environment that influences the moods and attitudes of workers. Youssef & Luthans (2007) examined the effects hope, optimism, and resilience had in the workplace on employees‚Äô job performance, job satisfaction, work happiness, and organizational commitment.Youssef, C. M., & Luthans, F. (2007). Positive organizational behavior in the workplace: The impact of hope, optimism, and resilience. Journal of Management, 33: 774-800. Hope and resilience had a more direct effect on organizational commitment whereas hope had a greater impact on performance. Hope allows employees to be better at creating more realistic plans for completing task so as not to focus on the failure that accompanies an incomplete task. Optimism strengthens the employee‚Äôs resilience to break through barriers and causes the employee to build social support and other strengths to overcome obstacle he or she may encounter. Positive psychology also encourages maintaining positive mood in the work environment to encourage productivity on an individual level and organizational level. Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) refer to behaviors like altruism and compliance that are not formal tasks in that the behaviors are not a mandatory of the workers job description. They are considered extra-role behaviors that help in gauging the workers commitment to the job and to the rules of the job in the absence of monitoring these behaviors. OCB have proven to improve the moods of employees and the moods in the workplace.Glomb, T.M., Bhave, D.P., Miner, A.G., & Wall, M. (2011). Doing good, feeling good: Examining the role of organizational citizenship behaviors in changing mood. Personnel Psychology, 64(1), 191-223. A helping behavior improves mood because the individual is no longer focused of negative moods; helping others acts as a distracter for the employee. Altruism is effective because it has more impact in a social setting like the workplace and is more extrinsically rewarding. OCB encourage positive interactions among workers and lead to better psychological health for employees. According to Froman (2010), having a more hopeful perspective about life leads one to being more optimistic about responding to opportunities.Froman, L. (2010). Positive psychology in the workplace. Journal of Adult Development, 17: 59-69. Workers are more resilient to adversity and are able to bounce back more quickly. When organizations encourage positive attitudes in their employees, they grow and flourish. As a result, the organization profits and grows from the human capital of productive employees and the monetary capital resulting from productive workers. Fun Chan (2010) studied fun activities in the workplace that created a positive work environment that could retain and attract employees and encourage employee well-being.Chan S.C.H., (2010) Does workplace fun matter? Developing a useable (sic) typology of workplace fun in a qualitative study. International Journal of Hospitality Management, 29(4), 720-728. Activities must be enjoyable, encourage responsibility, and help employees become team players. These qualities empower employees to become more engaged with their work, take on more leadership roles, and experience less stress. Making the work place fun promotes positive, happy moods in employees that in turn increase job satisfaction and organizational commitment. According to Chan‚Äôs framework, workplace fun must be staff-oriented, supervisor-oriented, social-oriented, or strategy oriented. While staff-oriented activities focus on creating fun work for employees, supervisor-oriented activities create a better relationship between the employees and supervisors. Social-oriented activities create social events that are organizational-based (i.e. company barbecue or Christmas office party). Strategy-oriented activities allow more autonomy with employees in different aspects of their work in hopes of cultivating strengths within the organization‚Äôs employees. The framework proposes that a fun work environment promotes employee well-being in addition to fostering creativity, enthusiasm, satisfaction and communication among the organization‚Äôs employees. The research found in this study hopes to encourage implementing other work fun activities in other various industries in order to engage and retain positive employees. Appliance There are several examples of popular, real- world uses of infusing Positive Psychology in the workplace. In such contexts such as a workplace, researchers often hope to examine and measure variable levels of such factors such as productivity and organization. One such popular model is the aforementioned Job Characteristics Model (JCM), which applies influential theories of work as it correlates to the five central characteristics of skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback.Turner N., Barling J., & Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715‚Äì728). New York: Oxford University Press. However, such practices such as business teams within a workplace often present the varying dynamics of positivity and negativity in business behaviors. There are often a plethora of special research teams that go into looking at certain workplaces in order to help report to employers the status of their employees. Furthermore, the three psychological states often measured and examined are: meaningfulness of performed work, responsibility of outcomes, and results knowledge. In mixing together these aspects, a score is generated in order to observe a range reflecting a job quality. In addition, each score details the differing degrees of autonomy and necessary feedback as it relates to ensuring high quality work. Most research points to the fact that typical teams of high performance are those that function high on positivity in their workplace behaviors. Controversies Adequate research regarding whether the practice of measuring factors, such as positive behaviors is lacking. More specifically, in attempting to measure some form of a variable in order to later ensure a positive environment context in the workplace, there is debate to an extent regarding which proper components to value and measure. Additionally, the act and process of specifically looking into certain factors of productivity in the workplace can also go on to influence workers negatively due to pressure. Conclusion The multitudes of research and new, developing information detailing the possibility of positive psychology at work often deals with reporting workplace safety, the engagement of the employees, productivity, and overall happiness.Turner N., Barling J., & Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715‚Äì728). New York: Oxford University Press. Moreover, understanding the significance of a healthy work environment can directly provide and contribute to work mastery and work ethic. Motivation, researchers have learned, helps to keep a reinforced sense of both discipline and a higher perception which then yields to higher levels of efficiency for both employees and employers.

The line of Trast√°maran royalty in Castile ruled throughout a time period of military struggle with Aragon. Their family was sustained with large amounts of inbreeding, which led to a series of disputed struggles over rightful claims to the Castilian throne. This lineage ultimately ruled in Castile from the rise to power of Henry II in 1369 through the unification of the crowns under Ferdinand and Isabella. 14th Century: Toward Unification with Aragon=Peter I and the Rise of Trast√°mara Upon the death of the Castilian King Alfonso XI in 1350, his eldest son, Peter, took control of the Castilian throne as Peter I of Castile. Peter was born to Alfonso and his wife, Maria of Portugal, but Alfonso lived out a long and public affair with Eleanor de Guzm√°n. Alfonso's illegitimate children that Eleanor had given birth to, known collectively as the Trast√°maras, immediately became rivals of the newly crowned Peter. Because of a personal history including political murders, his enemies quickly tagged Peter with his nickname Peter the Cruel. Also increasing the hostilities between Peter and his half brothers was the act of Peter's mother taking the opportunity of his power to have Eleanor of Guzman arrested and executed. Peter first resisted an attempt at his crown by defeating a coalition led by Henry of Trast√°mara (for whom Peter's half siblings derived their surname) in 1356. Peter again defeated his rivals at N√°jera in 1360 and had his half brothers Juan and Pedro executed. Having been protected by Aragon, Henry was forced to flee to France when the Castilian crown signed a peace treaty with Aragon in 1360. Henry supervising the beheading of his rival Peter, from the Grandes Chroniques de France. Gaining support throughout Castile because of his relation to Alfonso XI and Peter's continuous military escapades, Henry built an alliance with Aragon and France, including mercenaries led by French constable Bertram Du Guesclin for another attempt at the Castilian crown in 1365. Peter gained the support of Edward, the Black Prince, heir to the English throne and son of Edward III of England, to help defend his crown with the promise of territorial gains. On 13 April 1367, Peter and Edward's forces strongly defeated the armies of Francs, Aragonese, and Castilians led by Henry and captured Bertram Du Guesclin. As Edward fell ill and Peter failed to fulfill his land promises to England, the English withdrew their battlefield support of the Castilian Crown. In March 1369, with the continued support of France and Aragon, and growing support in important cities in parts of Castile, Henry's forces again invaded the Castilian Crown's realm and defeated Peter's army. Henry of Trast√°mara, himself, was responsible for the death of his brother, Peter I of Castile. Henry II‚Äôs Reign Following his killing of his half brother, Peter I, Henry of Trast√°mara took control of the crown of Castile as Henry II. Under Henry, a new nobility rose in prominence to gain land grants of large estates and vast royal privileges. The public rise of this new class of nobles caused discontent and instability in Castile. This class of nobility was driven by their desire to reclaim family holdings and was generally compelled to use any means necessary. Despite the instability, Henry's forces were able to withstand Portuguese, Navarrese, and Granadian attempts to invade and take control of Castile. Henry made an agreement with the ruler of Aragon, Peter IV, to have their children wed. Henry's son, John, was married to Peter IV's daughter, Eleanor, on 18 June 1375. This marriage by Henry's son would eventually put the Trast√°maras in control of both Castile and Aragon, comprising a majority of the Iberian Peninsula. After giving birth to three children, Eleanor died in 1382, after only seven years of marriage. The Trast√°maras Rule in Both Realms Upon Henry II's death in 1379, his son John came to power as John I of Castile. During his reign, John took Beatriz, daughter of the Portuguese King Fernando, as his second wife. Due to this marriage, John made an unsuccessful claim to the throne of Portugal upon Fernando's death in 1383, a move that would have led to the unification of all of the Iberian Peninsula. John died very unexpectedly in 1390. Upon his untimely death, John's eldest son Henry came to the throne as Henry III, at the very young age of twelve. He waited only two years to independently take power of the throne in 1393 at only fourteen years of age, amidst a great deal of violence being carried out against Jews throughout Castile. Among the young king's accomplishments was his taking of control of the Canary Islands, providing Castile with a holding in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1406, amidst an invasion by Granada's forces in Murcia, Henry died while planning a response at the age of 27. John II, Henry III's son, was left as the only heir upon Henry's death in 1406, but he was only two years old. Henry's brother, Ferdinand, served as regent to the throne, along with John's mother, Catalina of Lancaster. During his time as regent, Ferdinand was chosen as the ruler of Aragon, due to his maternal relation to the Aragonese throne, through the Compromise of Caspe in 1412. The Trast√°maras now ruled in both the realms of Castile and Aragon. 1418- 1469: Conflict within the House of Trast√°mara=John II and Don √Ålvaro Ca√±ete. John II came to power upon his mother's death in 1418. He was now a cousin to the King of Aragon, as Alfonso ascended to the throne upon Ferdinand I's death. John married Maria, the sister of Alfonso V of Aragon. Alfonso, himself, had already married John's sister, Maria, making the two rulers both cousins and brothers-in-law twice over. John II was now also a cousin and brother-in-law to Alfonso's brothers John and Henry, known collectively as the Infantes of Aragon, who had been given large amounts of land in Castile while their father worked as regent during John II's childhood. John II lacked widespread authority, and Castile became a battlefield for nobles to gain power and political influence. In 1420, just two years after coming to power, John was kidnapped by his cousin Infante Henry. Henry ruled on John's behalf for much of the year until John was able to escape with the help of his friend, and eventual royal favorite, √Ålvaro de Luna, who was known as Don √Ålvaro. In 1429, Alfonso V ordered the Infantes to lead a joint attack on Castile. Now John II's constable, Don Alvaro agreed to a basically victorious truce, as the Aragonese branch of Trastamaras was removed from Castile. John II's authority continued to decline following this military engagement, and he eventually ceded all power to Don Alvaro, who created an oligarchy of nobles. Don Alvaro lost this power in 1439 to nobility which was allied with Alfonso V, and in 1443, John II was once again captured by Infante John of Aragon, throwing Castile near anarchy. This confusion was settled in 1445, when a group of nobles favoring the monarchy, led by Don Alvaro, won a battle at Olmedo. Infante Henry of Aragon was killed as a result of this battle. In 1453, Don √Ålvaro was publicly beheaded for charges of tyranny. In July of the following year, John II died, and his son Henry became King Henry IV of Castile. Henry IV and the Rise of Isabella Henry IV of Castile was an unpopular ruler, largely in part because of his taste for Moorish fashion and his disagreement with military engagement with Granada. He was married at the age of 15 in 1440 to Infante John of Aragon's daughter, Blanca. This marriage failed, however, as a result of Henry's failure to consummate the marriage. He was remarried in 1455 to Juana of Portugal. Juana gave birth to Infanta Dona Juana in 1462, and she was recognized by the Cortes as Henry's legitimate successor. In 1464, charges were raised by powerful noble families that Infanta Juana was the daughter of one of Henry's favorites, Beltran de la Cueva. These powerful noble families eventually forced Henry to hand over power to his brother Alfonso in 1465, but Alfonso suddenly died a month later. Amidst the struggle to settle the ensuing claims to the throne, Henry's wife Juana became pregnant again while being held as a hostage of a noble family. This sign of misbehavior further weakened her daughter's claim to the throne, and paved the way for Isabella to take power. Pact of the Toros de Guisado and War of Succession The Pact of the Toros de Guisado was signed in 1468 and named Isabella heir to Henry's throne, as she and the nobles renewed their allegiance to Henry in return. A quick marriage for Isabella was a condition of the agreement, however Henry objected to her 1469 marriage to Ferdinand, who was the King of Sicily and the heir to the Aragonese throne, as a breach of the pact. He once again named Infanta Juana as his heir, and a civil war ensued throughout the next decade. Isabella's military factions were eventually victorious with the help of Aragon, making her queen and uniting the crowns of Aragon and Castile.

Opened in 1995, it was the second mall in the city after Rutland Mall. Despite initial success, the mall was hampered by financial issues through its developer and owner, Zamias Services, Inc. At its peak, the mall featured over 60 stores, with J. C. Penney, Sears, and Kmart as the anchor stores. The mall declined severely in tenancy throughout the Great Recession, and ultimately closed in October 2019. History Zamias Services, Inc. first applied for an Act 250 land use permit to build a mall in Rutland, Vermont in October 1988. While the permit was approved in 1989, the mall development was held up for many years afterward. Factors in the delay included acquisition of a federal wetlands permit, and a lack of financing stemming from difficulty in finding investors. In addition, Zamias sought a $6.2 million credit from the city of Rutland for making agreements to relocate Kmart from downtown Rutland to the mall and move Central Vermont Public Service offices into their former location. City of Rutland officials later compromised on the credit and agreed to pay Zamias $4 million on the condition that Zamias also pay impact fees to the city over the next 15 years. After securing a $38 million construction loan, Zamias finally began construction in April 1994. By September 1994, Zamias had confirmed that the mall would consist of over of retail space. In addition to Kmart, the other anchor stores would be J. C. Penney and Sears, and the mall would feature more than 60 stores. Zamias Services held a contest held a contest for locals to offer a name for the mall, and chose the name Diamond Run Mall in November 1994. Representatives thought that the name was fitting, given the prevalance of skiing in the area. Diamond Run Mall held a ribbon-cutting ceremony and opened its first twelve stores on August 23, 1995. Alongside J. C. Penney, Sears, and Kmart, the inline stores opened on that day were Barbara Moss clothing store, Gap, County Seat, Claire's, Regis and MasterCuts hair salons, GNC, Olympia Sports, and Sbarro. The mall's interior decor was themed after the summertime, with various paintings of butterflies, birds, kites, and flowers suspended from the ceiling. By the official grand opening in October, other stores that had opened included Payless ShoeSource, Yankee Candle, Disney Store, Eddie Bauer, National Record Mart, and Radio Shack. The mall's opening had an impact on Rutland Mall, an existing shopping center on the other side of Rutland. Many of its inline stores had moved to Diamond Run, including National Record Mart, Regis, GNC, Lauriat Books, and Hallmark Cards. By December 1997, Diamond Run Mall had still not been fully leased, and the city of Rutland had sued Zamias for $100,000 over not paying the first installment of its impact fees. The city of Rutland reassessed the mall's value in October 1998, and noted that Zamias' payments of property taxes had been on time after the initial taxes from 1995 had been delinquent. Despite this, the lawsuit over the unpaid impact fees remained open at the time. Then-mayor John Cassarino negotiated a payment plan toward the impact fees by January 2003, and noted that the funds had been used by the city of Rutland for sidewalk and streetlight improvement in the city. 21st century An ice rink called Rutland Regional Field was built behind the mall in 2004. Five years after its opening it was purchased by Castleton State College and renamed Spartan Arena. Old Navy opened at the mall in 2005, boosting mall occupancy above 90 percent. Despite this, many mall stores began to close over the next several years as their leases expired. These included Payless ShoeSource and Ritz Camera. In addition, Gap closed due to the presence of Old Navy, which it also owned at the time. However, the mall's occupancy remained above the national average, and several new stores opened as well. Among these were Spencer Gifts, a combination Dairy Queen/Orange Julius in the food court, and a locally-owned restaurant near Old Navy. The original plans for the mall called for a full-service restaurant to have opened off the food court, but mall developers instead used the space for a Rex TV and Appliance store after failing to find a suitable restaurant chain. In addition, a covered walkway was built to connect the ice arena to the mall. Diamond Run Mall saw a sharp decline in tenancy throughout the 21st century. It was sold in 2007 to Gemini Real Estate, and again in 2014 to BAI Rutland. At the time of the sale, the mall had declined to less than 50% occupancy. Zamias continued to serve as manager under BAI Rutland's ownership, and noted that the decline in tenancy during Gemini's ownership was likely due to the Great Recession. By 2014, mall vacancy continued to increase, with many tenants claiming that rents were too high. This was followed later in the year by an announcement that Sears would close. J. C. Penney closed one year later and was replaced by LaFlamme's Furniture, which also closed in 2017. Kmart closed in April 2018, leaving the mall without an anchor store. Zamias announced in mid-2019 that the mall would close by year's and end would be torn down for a new shopping center. At the time of this announcement, Zamias still owed over $50,000 in unpaid impact fees. The last businesses moved out or closed in October 2019, and mall assets were auctioned off a month later.

While Dean is primarily known for marine paintings from the Boston, Massachusetts region, he also developed many charcoal, pen and pencil drawings, watercolors and oil paintings of non- marine topics, including still life, architecture and landscapes. Dean was a recognized artist while he was alive and was listed in the 1903 Men of Massachusetts, along with Who's Who in American Art. Dean's most famous painting, Peace (see below: Peace), is owned by the US Government and was exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair in May‚ÄìOctober 1893.  Family  Walter Lofthouse Dean was born on June 4, 1854, in Lowell, Massachusetts, in Middlesex County. He was the third son of Benjamin Dean and Mary Ann (French) Dean, who were related to several of the best-known families of the region. Walter Dean's grandparents, Benjamin Dean and Alice Lofthouse Dean, of Clitheroe, England, moved to the United States of America in 1829, when Benjamin, an engraver and designer, entered the employ of the Merrimack Print Works. Dean's father, Benjamin Dean was born in Clitheroe, England in 1824, and became a prominent Boston lawyer and a US Congressman. His mother, Mary Ann French, was born to Josiah Bowers French, a bank president and former Mayor of Lowell, and his wife, Mary Anne Stevens of Billerica, Massachusetts. Dean had three brothers and two sisters. He never knew his oldest brother, Josiah French Dean, who died before the age of two. His second oldest brother, Benjamin Wheelock Dean, was a contractor who married Annie Page of South Boston. His younger sister, Clitheroe, was born in South Boston and married Charles L. James of Brookline. His youngest brother, Josiah Stevens Dean married May Lillian Smith in 1888 and became a prominent Boston lawyer and judge who died in 1941. Dean's youngest sister, Mary Dean, was born in Lowell and married Walter Tufts.  Education  Dean was serious about his career as an artist from an early age, though there may have been some family pressure to pursue a more financially certain career path in the cotton textile industry. After graduating from public school, Dean left Boston to learn all details of the cotton manufacturing business at a mill in Tilton, New Hampshire. While at this mill, he learned all aspect of the business as an apprentice working at each of the machines and offices within the factory. Dean ultimately decided that he did not want to enter the cotton manufacturing business and instead decided to work full-time in art. Seascape He was accepted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's School of Architecture in 1873, but left MIT to study the fine arts at the Massachusetts State Normal Art School (now known as Mass College of Art & Design) where his brother's father-in-law, Walter Smith (art educator),Art Education, Scholastic and Industrial, Walter Smith, webpage:BG-F4: about Walter Smith. was co-founder and Principal. Upon graduation from the Normal Art School, Dean became an instructor at Purdue University, in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1876. In 1877, Dean returned to Boston to become a teacher of drawing at the Boston Free Evening Drawing School. In 1882, at the age of 28, he traveled to France, where he first spent seven months on the French coast, sketching the local people and boats in Brittany. He then went on to Paris, France to study at the Acad√©mie Julian with Jules-Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger. These were two of the most influential art instructors in the world at that time. He also befriended Achille Oudinot (1820‚Äì1891), another very well known French artist who is remembered to this day as Corot's favorite student. You will see great similarities in Oudinot's work and Walter Dean's work. It is apparent that Dean enjoyed Europe, where he traveled primarily along the coastlines of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and England.  Early life  In 1885, Dean fitted up a yacht of twenty-six tons, and set out on a four-month sketching cruise along the New England coast, visiting every port between Boston and Eastport, acting as his own skipper and pilot. Later he made more extended voyages on the barkentine Christiana Redman and the bark Woodside for the purposes of becoming familiar with square-rigged vessels. He had, however, been used to the sea and acquainted with ships from boyhood, so that this was no new experience for him. Early in his teens, through his love of adventure and fondness of the sea, he made a cruise of a month on a Gloucester fishing vessel to the Banks; and, when a school boy, he passed every possible moment out of school hours on the water. His cat-boat Fannie was long the fastest boat of her size, and took first prize in many races.  Professional life  Enterprise, by Walter Lofthouse Dean Dean settled in Boston, where for many years, he was one of the most prominent members of the Paint and Clay Club, the Art Club, and the Society of Water Color Painters. His large picture Peace, depicting several units of the White Squadron in Boston harbor, was one of the notable works of the American section at the Chicago Exposition. His canvases were seen in most of the important general exhibitions for more than a quarter century. He was always fascinated by the sea and was a life member, trustee and one-time commodore of the Boston Yacht Club. He made several voyages out of Gloucester on fishing vessels. Shortly before his death, which occurred in 1912, he spent an entire summer nominally as ship's carpenter (since law would not permit his going as a passenger) aboard one of the whalers out of Bedford. During this voyage, which was confined to the North Atlantic ground off Cape Hatteras, he made valuable sketches and studies of present-day whaling operations. Walter Lofthouse Dean died at his home in Gloucester, Massachusetts, on March 13, 1912.  Peace  Peace, by Walter L. Dean, 1891 Perhaps his most important work, Peace (see image) is a large painting () depicting the original US Navy fleet at rest in Boston Harbor. Peace was completed in 1891, exhibited widely from 1891 to 1900, placed in the US Capitol in 1900 and purchased by the US Government in 1928. Known variously as \\"The White Squadron\\" and \\"The Squadron of Evolution\\", this impressive fleet of white-hulled, ironclad, steam and sail-powered naval war ships was built to protect America's growing commercial ventures at sea in the late 19th century. An 1895 article in the Boston Sunday Journal had the following to say about Peace. The US House Resolution 5454 in 1900 states the following: > The bill proposes to purchase an historical painting entitled \\"Peace\\" by > Walter L. Dean of Boston, Massachusetts. It represents \\"The Squadron of > Evolution,\\" better known as \\"The White Squadron,\\" as constituted in 1891, > lying peacefully at anchor in the harbor of Boston. This squadron is the > nucleus of the present Navy. The Chicago as originally constructed was bark > rigged, and it is in the foreground of the painting. The Boston and Atlanta > are represented as brig rigged, while the Newark is bark rigged and the > Yorktown is schooner rigged. These vessels have since been reconstructed to > meet modern requirements, so that their original identity has been lost. > \\"Peace\\" shows them as originally constructed, and is a means of keeping in > view the type of ship which started the Navy of which every American is > justly proud.

The painting remained with the committee throughout various relocations in the Capitol and, in 1919, to the Cannon House Office Building; Peace has been on view in room 311.

Earlier in his career, Miller broadcast Illinois State Normal University athletics and other local sports on WJBC radio in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois.  Personal life  The 13th child and seventh son of James and Margaret McMillan Miller, ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù Miller was born in St. Louis, but moved to Chicago with his family when he was five. Miller attended Hyde Park High School where he was given the nickname ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù by Chicago Tribune sports writer Westbrook Pegler. When the Hyde Park boys' basketball team played before a Purdue-University of Chicago game, Pegler compared Miller‚Äôs 6'6\\", 220-pound frame to Purdue star ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù Murphy. After graduating from Hyde Park, Miller briefly attended the University of Illinois, before transferring to Illinois State Normal University (now known as Illinois State University). Miller became a standout player on ISNU‚Äôs men‚Äôs basketball team, and in 1931, he led the Cardinals (now known as the Redbirds) to the Little Nineteen Conference basketball championship. Miller also served as the editor of the Vidette, student newspaper, was class president, and was involved in drama and music at ISNU. Miller went on to marry Dorothy Nell Salzman in 1942, and they had a son, Robert.  Early broadcasting career  Shortly after graduating from Illinois State Normal University in 1933, Miller was hired by newly established Bloomington-Normal, Illinois radio station, WJBC. Miller was expected to announce news and sports, plus handle recorded shows, do a man-on-the-street program, write commercials and help sell advertisements. Miller‚Äôs first sports play-by-play job consisted of broadcasting Bloomington Bloomers baseball games. The Bloomers were members of the Three-Eye, a Class B league, and served as a farm team for the St. Louis Cardinals. Miller also broadcast play-by-play of Illinois State Normal University, Illinois Wesleyan, and local high school basketball and football. In 1940, Miller moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he was hired by WCBS radio. Miller worked in Springfield for two years, before he enlisted in the U.S. Navy from 1942-45. Miller and his crew were responsible for transporting Army and Marine personnel to various island invasions. Upon his return to Springfield in 1945, Miller continued at WCBS.  St. Louis Cardinals  In the summer of 1946, Miller was contacted by Oscar Zahner, the head of Ruthrauff and Ryan advertising, which handled the account of Greisedieck Brothers Beer, the sponsors of the St. Louis Cardinals. Miller was asked to audition for an open Cardinals radio announcing position. Following his audition, Miller was hired to join the Cardinals broadcasting team of Harry Caray and Charles ‚ÄúGabby‚Äù Street. Miller was given an eight-year contract, which was scheduled to be terminated when Busch bought the Cardinals in 1954, ending Greisedieck‚Äôs sponsorship. During his time in St. Louis, Miller not only broadcast Cardinals games, but also other local sporting events, including professional St. Louis Bombers basketball, professional St. Louis Flyers hockey, Washington University and St. Louis University college football and basketball, and some local high school sports. Miller remained with the Cardinals until his contract ended in 1954.  Post-Cardinals Career  After leaving his play-by-play job with the Cardinals, Miller did freelance sports broadcasting work in St. Louis for a year, before he and his family moved to Peoria, Illinois. Miller was hired as the station manager and sports director at a yet-to-be-open television station, owned by radio station WIRL. Miller worked at WIRL until the television station was operational; however, when funding for the station fell through, Miller was forced to work elsewhere. Miller was hired by the Peoria newspaper, the Journal Star, where he began working in the Community Relations Department in 1959. Additionally, Miller offered his services as a banquet and luncheon speaker. By the end of his career, Miller estimated that he made 2,000 speeches and worked on 25,000 sports broadcasts. Miller died from incurable Amyothrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease) in 1972.  Accolades  Following his eight-year stint with the St. Louis Cardinals, Miller was inducted into the Cardinals‚Äô Hall of Fame, and honored with ‚ÄúStretch Miller Weekend‚Äù in St. Louis in 1971. Miller was also inducted into the Illinois State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1972. In his honor, the Stretch Miller Award is presented annually by Illinois State to an individual who has displayed commitment and dedicated service to the ISU athletics department.

On 15 January 1915, together with his secretary, he was deported to San Francisco aboard the SS Sonoma, from where he finally was able to return to Germany.Biographisches Handbuch German New Guinea; Fa√überg 2002 (no ISBN), p. 123 In Berlin, he continued as the Acting-Governor of German New Guinea and was officially appointed Governor on 14 December 1917, as Hahl was declared unfit by Wilhelm Solf, the Imperial Colonial Secretary. This appointment resulting in Haber becoming the last Governor of German New Guinea. Both Emperor Wilhelm II and Erich Ludendorff believed that the continuation of a Governorship during the war was a hasty and badly conceived decision, as the Pacific colony would play no further role for Germany. Life after the war At peace talks to the C Mandates of the League of Nations, Haber was appointed as the second member of the German delegation in May 1919. He later resigned due to the hopelessness of his work in negotiations and took over the Coal Management Institute in Mecklenburg. In 1920, Haber was appointed President of the Imperial Pay Board. After leaving the Imperial service in 1923, he assumed a teaching position at the Bergakademie Clausthal and received an Honorary Professorship in 1924, remaining there until 1927. Between 1928 and 1945, Haber taught at the University of T√ºbingen as mandated lecturer for international colonial science and the resource sector. Although never receiving a doctorate, he was often titled \\"Dr\\". His request to be granted an honorary doctorate was rejected and he had to be satisfied with a conferred honorary citizenship in 1936.Biographisches Handbuch,..., S 123: Prof. Dr. Bacher, Berlin, writing of PG citing. He died on 14 January 1947 at T√ºbingen. In 1936 the city honoured him with the naming of a street.

It stretches along a narrow lane, lined with richly decorated brick buildings, built during the late Mughal or Colonial period.  Location  Shankhari Bazar is located near the intersection of Islampur Road and Nawabpur Road, a block north of the Buriganga River. The place especially belongs to the Bengali Hindus. About 70%‚Äì80% of the area's residents are Bengali Hindus, the rest being Muslims. Temple Gate  Background and Name  The area was dominated by the Shankhari community, who derived their name from Shankha, a decorated bangle crafted from slices of Shankha or conch shells. A Shankha bangle is the symbol that indicates that a Hindu woman is married. In the 17th century, the Shankharis (conch shell workers) were reportedly brought to Dhaka by the Mughal emperor, who allotted them this area for settlement; it later became known as Shankhari Bazaar. Shankhari Bazaar is a long narrow street lined by brick buildings of some antiquity. The buildings are about 12 ft wide, 70‚Äì100 ft deep and 2‚Äì3 storeys high. The greatest height of the buildings is four storeys. Every house used to have a temple room in it.  The craft of the Shankharis  The Shankhari people are an artisan caste. Their traditional occupation is the preparation of bangles and rings made from slices of conch shell, using specialized tools. Dhaka was for long the main centre of the conch cutting industry in India.The Sacred Chank of India, James Hornell, Government Press, Madras, 1914 In 1971 a massacre carried out by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh War of Liberation greatly reduced the population of Shankharis in Dhaka, and the main centre of the industry is now Kolkata.Bangle in a Tangle, Prasun Chaudhuri, The Telegraph, Kolkata, 2017 Faith According to James Hornell F.L.S., Superintendent of the Pearl and Chank Fisheries to the Government of Madras at the beginning of the 20th century, \\"The workers belong exclusively to the Sankhari sub-caste of Vaisyas: they appear to be very conservative and have the reputation of being exceedingly clannish.\\" Currently most of the Shankhari people belong to the Vaishnava branch of Hinduism, and some to the Shakta school; many are vegetarian.  Temples and Durga Puja  Statue of Deity Durga The Hindu temples are one of the major attractions of Shankhari Bazar. There are many temples on this narrow street. Over the ages, Shankhari Bazaar has been elevated to the level of the most popular centre for religious festivities. As one of the most densely populated areas in the world Shankhari Bazaar also has the largest concentration of the Hindus in Dhaka. The temples are small in size but well decorated with ornamental motifs on the entrance and on the walls of the temples. The temples contain the statue of goddess Durga, Ganesha, Shiva etc. Durga Puja is the major festival of Hindu people. During Durga puja, people gathers in Shankhari Bazaar to worship and view goddess Durga. Besides Hindu, Muslims also attend the Puja. In Durga puja, Shankhari Bazaar looks quite nice because of colourful feston, banner etc. Small and temporary food shops are also built during Durga puja. People from different places come to Shankhari Bazaar to see the Puja.  Pannitola  Pannitola is in the Rakhal Chandra Basak Lane of Shankhari Bazaar. The name Pannitola basically came from the first settling area of the Panniwala, people who used to make the foil of tin. The living style of the Panniwala's was similar to the Shankhari people.

They are rare and important exemplars of Kushan art of the 1st or 2nd centuries CE, attesting to the cosmopolitan tastes and patronage of local dynasts, the sophistication of contemporary craftsmanship, and to the ancient trade in luxury goods. They are the best known element of the Begram Hoard. The D√©l√©gation Arch√©ologique Fran√ßaise en Afghanistan conducted excavations at the site between 1936 and 1940, uncovering two walled-up strongrooms, Room 10 and Room 13. Inside, a large number of bronze, alabaster, glass (remains of 180 pieces), coins, and ivory objects, along with remains of furniture and Chinese lacquer bowls, were unearthed. Some of the furniture was arranged along walls, other pieces stacked or facing each other. In particular, a high percentage of the few survivals of Greco-Roman enamelled glass come from this discovery. History The ancient city of Kapisa (near modern Bagram), in Bactria was the summer capital of the Kushan Empire, which stretched from northern Afghanistan to northwest India between the 1st and the 4th centuries. Some eighty miles from Kabul, the strategically located city dominated two passes through the Hindu Kush, connecting Bactria with Gandhara (modern north- east Pakistan. The finds were divided, in accordance with the system of partage, between the Mus√©e Guimet and the National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul. After the Kabul Museum closed in 1978 the whereabouts of the ivories was uncertain, and many items were looted in the 1990s. A number of the missing items were located in 2004, and a further group of twenty pieces, illicitly traded by antiquities dealers, was later recovered and is to be repatriated. After conservation treatment in the British Museum they were exhibited there in 2011.

Both ivory and bone were carved in relief panels, often with two or three strips forming a single inlay. Only ivory was used for openwork. After carving the surfaces were smoothed and lightly polished. Traces of colour survive, showing the use of alternating red and blue pigments, and the highlighting of plain backgrounds with red or black. The mineral pigment vermilion and the organic colorant indigo have been identified. The inlays were attached to what have been identified as chairs and footstools by copper alloy rivets, through pre- drilled holes. The woodwork itself has disintegrated, preventing identification of the species and source of the timber, but metal nails and clamps survive. Conservation Organic materials such as ivory and bone are fragile and prone to environmental deterioration. In order to stabilise the ivory fragments and lift them from the ground they were coated in gelatine and faced in tissue. Trapping dirt and deteriorating and shrinking over time, these and subsequent coatings have resulted in damage to the ivory and loss of pigmentation. Cracks and breaks have been filled with a variety of adhesives, without consolidation of the edge, and differing reconstructions led to the accumulation of residues from previous treatments. Technical analysis by the British Museum provided information on materials and techniques of production, present condition, deterioration phenomena, and previous interventions. Subsequent treatment included the reduction of previous coatings, consolidation, and fills using reversible and compatible materials, with subsequent toning. Subject matter The range of motifs include lions, elephants, birds, flowers, female nudes, musicians, dancers, personal ornaments, and architectural backdrops. Some inlays are inscribed with fitters' marks in Kharosthi, Brahmi, and a third unidentified script. Dating, attribution, influences and parallels Indian art also found its way into Italy, within the context of Indo-Roman trade: in 1938 the Pompeii Lakshmi was found in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE). The rarity of parallels has resulted in disputes as to the origin and date of the ivories, although the stratigraphy would suggest a date no later than the 2nd century. The building itself in which the ivories were found has been dated to the 1st century CE. The Pompeii Lakshmi, a caryatid found in the Via dell'Abbondanza in Pompeii with a Kharosthi fitter's mark provides further evidence of long-distance trade in Indian furniture decorated with ivory. This could also mean that she might have originated from the northwestern region of India, and manufactured in local workshops around the area of Gandhara.Afghanistan: Forging Civilizations Along the Silk Road, Joan Aruz, Elisabetta Valtz Fino, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2012 p.75 There is therefore a possibility that these ivories were made locally in the northwest regions on India, and should be dated to the early 1st century CE.

Located at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, in Jackson hole Wy. it takes people to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, at a summit of 10,450 Ft, or 3,185 meters. The first tram started operation on July 31, 1966, while the second tram started operation on December 20, 2008. The current tram holds 100 skiers and 1 operator in the winter. at 4,000 ft. in elevation gain, it is the longest ski lift in North America. The original tram carried 62 skiers and 1 conductor, and took 10.5 minutes History The original tram took a total of 26 months to build, from May 1964-July 1966. Its maiden voyage was on July 31, 1966. Just like the current tram, it has 5 Cable tower's with tower 1 being the tallest at 65 Meters or 196 ft. It carried 62 skiers and 1 conductor in winter and 45 passengers and 1 conductor in summer to the top in 12 minutes minutes. still to this day, the trams slows down in the summer for sight seeing. Two thirds of the money for construction in the 1960s came from the federal government. $1 million of a $1.6 million grant came from a government program called Area Redevelopment Administration which proposed to loan funds to seasonally depressed communities. Retirement After 40 years of service, the Kemmerer family (the owners of the resort) decided to retire the tram in September 2005. An inspection revealed that the tram would last for a couple more years, but the family thought it best to decommission it before any safety hazards raised. One of the many problems was that the almost 41 year old cables were starting to unwind and unravel. Designs for the new tram were released and approved in early 2007 with demolition and construction beginning in April of that year, the day after the resort closed for the 2006-2007 ski season. The Austrian company Doppelmayr Garaventa created the five steel towers, terminals and mechanics. In March 2008 the company shipped everything to Houston, Texas in 50 sea containers. From there, all the components traveled on train or road to Jackson Hole, Wy. Construction was completed on time in December 2008. The original $20 million they thought it was going to take to make the new tram later became $31 million which was completely funded by the resort. Launch of the New Tram The launch of the new tram happened on December 19, 2008. 20,000 people came to show their support that night. The tram slowly made its way down the cables towards the new lower terminal when it stopped over the crowd. The crowd cheered as the wrap covering it dropped. There were fireworks and music as someone dressed as Santa zipped down from the car. Seasons=Winter In winter, skiers take the tram to the top of the mountain where they are able to ski Rendezvous Mountain as well as out of bounds locations. Many also eat at Corbet's Cabin,which serves World Famous waffles. You pay for your ticket in your ski pass at the ticket office under Resort restaurant RPK 3, originally Nick Wilson's Cafe. Summer In summer, tourists as well as locals take the tram in order to look at the views, where on a clear day you are able to see the town of Jackson ,the Jackson hole Valley, Grand Teton National Park, and the summit of the Teton mountains. Many go for sightseeing, paragliding,and hiking. In the early season which is from May 28 to June 17 an adult ticket costs $23. In the Peak and late season which is from June 18 to October 6, adult tickets cost $45. and kids and teens cost from 5 to 30 dollars. elderaly cost 20 dollars, and kids 3 and younger are free .

In 1954, the first permanent school buildings were constructed on the current site. In 1968, the school became fully independent of the church. Various expansions occurred until 2008 when the school buildings were demolished and replaced with a new facility designed by Bassetti Architects.School history, retrieved online 2011-04-28 Facilities Planted balcony, accessible to teachers and students, with school's private playground in background The school shares a campus with St. Thomas Episcopal Church. The two facilities are adjacent but not connected. The school's playground is shielded from outside view by the L-shaped configuration of the two-story school building. The public facades of the school are designed to reflect the more formal, rectangular, stone-clad character of the adjacent church. The facades that face the playground are more informal, free-form, and brightly colored. Three of the school's four wings (two each on two floors) are for a different age group, with classrooms opening off of common activity areas for group learning, tutoring, project- based learning, and individual instruction. The fourth wing houses the library and specialist classrooms (music, art, Spanish, etc.). The building includes a science lab, technology center, media publishing lab, library/multi-media center, a dedicated foreign language classroom, music room, and exterior covered plazas for play and outdoor learning. The facility was designed to celebrate cycles of nature and human learning, to demonstrate leadership in environmental responsibility, and to support the school's educational program by addressing the latest research on cognitive development. The grounds include a playfield, covered play areas, and a children's garden for students to cultivate plants. St. Thomas is in the process of expanding its facilities. A new gym and theater complex will be built on newly acquired property next to the current campus. Ground was broken on the project on November 6, 2019. It was expected to be completed by September of 2020, but work slowdowns due to COVID19 have pushed back this date to early 2021.

The village's male literacy stands at 93.52%, while female literacy rate is only 64.27%. Caste factor Members of the Scheduled Castes (SC) constitute 10.14% of the total population of Nabipura village. The village currently doesn‚Äôt have any Scheduled Tribe (ST) in its population. Almost all people belong to the Hindu religion, but there is no caste-based discrimination in the community. Work profile In Nabipura village, 767 people work. 41.2% of them describe their work as main work (employment or earning for more than 6 months), 58.80% as marginal activity (providing a livelihood for less than 6 months). Of the 767 workers engaged in main work, 190 are farmers (owners or co-owners) while 28 are agricultural laborers. Places of interest Nabipura features a variety of temples, including those of the Goddess Durga (jeen mata), Gogaji, Thakurji, Karni Mata and Balaji.  Geography  The natural climatic conditions in the village are very harsh. The temperature ranges from sub-zero in the winters to more than 50¬∞C in the summers. The summers bring heat waves called loo. The village lies in the Thar Desert region and annual rainfall is very low, on the scale of 4.5 cm. The people in the region depend on rainwater for agriculture. There are three major tube-wells in the village (punia ka bass, dhaka ka bass and in the harijana ka mohala). The ground water in the village is in good condition and is supplied in different mohalas (a locality in a village or town) of the village like the Kotri mohala and the Kathi kua mohala. Administration Fatehpur also serves as a constituency of the Rajasthan legislative assembly. Fatehpur Panchayat Samiti has under it the following villages: Athwas, Almas (Aalmas), Badusar, Balara, Balod, Banthod, Batdanau, Beswa, Bhinchari, Bibipur, Birania, Chudimiyan, Dataru, Deenwa-ladkhani, Dewas, Dhandan, Dhimoli, Dishnau, Gangyasar, Gaarinda, Godiya, Hirna, Hudera, Kayamsar, Khotiya, Mandela, Nabipura, Nayabas, Palas, Rajas, Rajpura, Rohal, Rosawa, Sahnusar, Takhalsar and Tihawali. As per the constitution of India and the Panchyati Raaj Act, Nabipura village is administrated by the Sarpanch (Head of Village) who is the elected representative of the village.

Although there are some beneficial uses of biofilms, they are generally considered undesirable, and means of biofilm prevention have been developed. Biofilms secrete extracellular polymeric substance that provides a structural matrix and facilitates adhesion for the microorganisms; the means of prevention have thus concentrated largely on two areas: killing the microbes that form the film, or preventing the adhesion of the microbes to a surface. Because biofilms protect the bacteria, they are often more resistant to traditional antimicrobial treatments, making them a serious health risk. For example, there are more than one million cases of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) reported each year, many of which can be attributed to bacterial biofilms. There is much research into the prevention of biofilms.  Methods  Biofilm prevention methods fall into two categories: # prevention of microbe growth; and # prevention of microbe surface attachment.  Prevention of microbe growth = Antimicrobial coatings  Chemical modifications are the main strategy for biofilm prevention on indwelling medical devices. Antibiotics, biocides, and ion coatings are commonly used chemical methods of biofilm prevention. They prevent biofilm formation by interfering with the attachment and expansion of immature biofilms. Typically, these coatings are effective only for a short time period (about 1 week), after which leaching of the antimicrobial agent reduces the effectiveness of the coating. The medical uses of silver and silver ions have been known for some time; its use can be traced to the Phoenicians, who would store their water, wine, and vinegar in silver bottles to keep them from spoiling. There has been renewed interest in silver coatings for antimicrobial purposes. The antimicrobial property of silver is known as an oligodynamic effect, a process in which metal ions interfere with the growth and function of bacteria.Antibacterial effects of Silver, Salt Lake Metals Several in vitro studies have confirmed the effectiveness of silver at preventing infection, both in coating form and as nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix. However, concerns remain over the use of silver in vivo. Considering the mechanism by which silver interferes with bacterial cell function, some fear that silver may have a similarly toxic effect on human tissue. For this reason, there has been limited use of silver coatings in vivo. Despite this, silver coatings are commonly used on devices such as catheters.  Water purification  When this technique was studied two purification methods were used to treat water. The first was a typical reverse osmosis technique used for pure water. The other was a double reverse osmosis technique with electric deionization which was continuously disinfected with UV light and disinfected weekly with ozone. The tubing it ran through was tested weekly for bacterial colonies. The highly purified water showed a sharp decrease in bacteria colony adherence. Water purification methods are being scrutinized here because it is in this state that contamination is thought to occur and biofilms are formed.  Prevention of microbes' surface attachment = Chemical  Polymer modification  Dispersive forces of grafted polymer chains can prevent bacterial adhesion to a surface To avoid the undesirable effects of leaching, antimicrobial agents can be immobilized on device surfaces using long, flexible polymeric chains. These chains are anchored to the device surface by covalent bonds, producing non-leaching, contact-killing surfaces. One in vitro study found that when N-alkylpyridinium bromide, an antimicrobial agent, was attached to a poly(4-vinyl-N- hexylpyridine), the polymer was capable of inactivating ‚â• 99% of S. epidermidis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa bacteria. Dispersion forces between the polymer chains and the bacterial cells prevent bacteria from binding to the surface and initiating biofilm growth. The concept is similar to that of steric stabilization of colloids. Polymer chains are grafting to a surface via covalent bonding or adsorption. The solubility of these polymers stems from the high conformational entropy of polymer chains in solution. The Œß (Chi) parameter is used to determine whether a polymer will be soluble in a given solution. Œß is given by the equation: :\\\\chi = \\\\frac{{(\\\\delta_1-\\\\delta_2})^2 \\\\times \\\\bar{V}}{RT}. \\\\ where \\\\delta_1 and \\\\delta_2 are the cohesive energy densities of the polymer and solvent, respectively, \\\\bar{V} is the molar volume of the solution (assuming \\\\bar{V_1}=\\\\bar{V_2}), R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvins. If 0 < \\\\chi< 2, the polymer will be soluble.  Ozonation  Biofilms form as a way of survival for bacteria in aqueous situations. Ozone targets extracellular polysaccharides, a group of bacterial colonies on a surface, and cleaves them. The ozone cuts through the skeleton of the biofilm at a rapid pace thus dissolving it back to harmless microscopic fragments. Ozone is so effective because it is a very strong oxidant and it encounters biofilms in much larger concentrations than most disinfectants like chlorine. This technique has been employed mainly in the spa and pool industry as a way to purify water.Barnes, Ronald L., and D. Kevin Caskey. \\"Using Ozone in the Prevention of Bacterial Biofilm Forming and Scaling.\\" Water Condition & Purification Magazine. 2002. Web. 20 May 2011. .  Surface charge  Modification of the surface charge of polymers has also proven to be an effective means of biofilm prevention. Based on the principles of electrostatics charged particles will repel other particles of like charge. The hydrophobicity and the charge of polymeric chains can be controlled by using several backbone compounds and antimicrobial agents. Positively charged polycationic chains enables the molecule to stretch out and generate bactericidal activity.  Mechanical = Hydrophobicity  Contact angle of a liquid droplet wetted to a rigid solid surface. The ability of bacteria to adhere to a surface and begin the formation of a biofilm is determined in part by the enthalpy of adhesion of the surface. Adherence is thermodynamically favored if the free enthalpy of adhesion is negative and decreases with increasing free enthalpy values. The free energy of adhesion can be determined by measuring the contact angles of the substances in question. Young's Equation can be used to determine whether if adhesion is favorable or unfavorable: :\\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{SL}}+\\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{LV}}\\\\cos{\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{c}}=\\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{SV}}\\\\, where \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{SL}}, \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{LV}}, and \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{SV}} are the interfacial energies of the solid‚Äìliquid, the liquid‚Äìvapor, and the solid‚Äìvapor interfaces, respectively. Using this equation, \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{c} can be determined.  Surface roughness Wenzel model Surface roughness can also affect biofilm adhesion. Rough, high-energy surfaces are more conducive to biofilm formation and maturation, while smooth surfaces are less susceptible to biofilm adhesion. The roughness of a surface can affect the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the contacting substance, which in turn affects its ability to adhere. The Wenzel equation can be used to estimate the observed contact angle: :\\\\cos\\\\,{\\\\theta_{obs}}= R \\\\cos\\\\,{\\\\theta} where \\\\theta_{obs} is the apparent contact angle and R is the roughness parameter of the surface. R is the ratio of actual surface area over projected surface area. The Wenzel equation predicts that a hydrophilic surface will have a lower \\\\theta_{obs}, thus making it easier for bacteria to adhere. It is thus desirable to maintain a smooth surface on any products that may come in contact with bacteria. Studies have shown that there is a threshold value of surface roughness (Ra = 2 ¬µm) below which biofilm adhesion will reduce no further.  Low-energy surface acoustic waves  This technique uses low- energy waves produced from a battery powered device. The device delivers periodic rectangular pulses through an actuator holding a thin piezo plate. The waves spread to the surface, in this case a catheter, creating horizontal waves that prevent the adhesion of planktonic bacteria to surfaces. This technique has been tested on white rabbits and guinea pigs. The results showed a lowered biofilm growth. Examples of antibiofilm agents Antibiofilm agents are the nontoxic molecules which have moieties such as: imidazole, indole, sulfide peptides, and triazole; and other moieties which give it a characteristic to disperse or inhibit biofilm formation. There are many antibiofilm agents such as: Aryl rhodanines, Cis-2-Decenoic acid (C2DA) and ionic liquid. Aryl rhodanines Aryl rhodanines chemical structure is [(Z)-3-(4-Ô¨Çuorophenyl)-5-(3-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one]. Aryl rhodanines inhibit the adhesion of bacterial cell such as: staphylococcus aureus and enterococci in the first step of biofilm formation, because it prevents the initial interaction between bacterial cells and adhesion surface, the mechanism of inhibit biofilm by these molecules exhibit the physical interaction between aryl rhodanine and adhesine which are located on the bacterial cell surface. These molecules don‚Äôt have any antimicrobial effect against any type of bacteria. Cis-2-Decenoic acid (C2DA) The C2DA inhibit methicillin resistant staphylococcus biofilm, but don‚Äôt eliminate it. The mechanism of the biofilm inhibition by these molecules is still unknown. C2D is a medium of fatty acid chain that effect on staphylococcus aureus biofilm and dispersion of these biofilm. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main sourse for these molecules. Ionic liquid Ionic liquid is a group of salt modification by anion and cation discret. It has flexibility to exhibit antibiofim activity and has antimicrobial activity, it has many antibiofilm activities and prevents the biofilm formation for many gram-positive and gram- negative bacteria. Glycosidase/ glycosyl hydrolase Other than chemicals, enzymes have been used to degrade the biofilm matrix and eject biofilm cells forcibly. First shown in P. aeruginosa, a glycosyl hydrolase PslG can trigger biofilm disassembly by disrupting exopolysaccharide matrix in biofilms effectively and can be used in combination with antibiotics to kill the cells released from biofilms.

Origins and evolution By some estimates, the Quarantia was established in 1179 as part of the constitutional reforms that transformed the monarchy into a communal form. It was established as an assembly of forty electors who were entitled at that time to nominate the Doge of Venice. These forty were elected in their turn by nine electors who were nominated by the popular assembly, la concio. After completing their primary role as the Doge's nominators, they remained in power alongside the Doge as the Judiciary, participating with the Consiglio dei Pregadi (Senate) in the state government and the legislative functions, which were often delegated to them by the Great Council, in which the forty were members by law. After the constitutional reform of 1297, which, with the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio (Lockout of the Great Council), changed the state's form into an aristocratic republic, the Quarantia was responsible for the approval and the scrutiny of new appointments to the Grand Council and the Senate but also, according to Maranini, preparation of draft laws concerning criminal justice and fiscal management. In time, the Quarantia lost its legislative and representative functions to the Council of Senate and around 1380, after the creation of the College of the Sages, its executive functions were largely taken away as well. The Forty preserved as a result from that time the functions of governing the mint (defining the fineness of the coins, the nature and quality of the stamping), the preparation of financial and revenue plans to be submitted to the Great Council and, above all, the supreme judicial function. Forty judges were elected by the Great Council and held office for one year; they could be re-elected, and in case of a vacancy could co-opt new judges. The Supreme Court was tripled over time to better meet the judicial needs, creating new Quarantie: # In 1441 the original Forty took the name of Criminal Quarantia and a Civil Quarantia was put alongside it. # In 1491 the Civil Quarantia became known as the Old Civil Quarantia and was joined by the New Civil Quarantia. Criminal jurisdiction The Criminal Quarantia had jurisdiction over misdemeanors and felonies and in general over criminal law. The three leaders of the Forty sat beside the Doge and Minor Council in the Serenissima Signoria, the supreme representative body of the Republic. The confirmation of the Serenissima Signoria was necessary to give effect to the death penalty. The functions of prosecutor before this court were assumed by the Avogadori de Com√πn. Civil law The Old Civil Quarantia had jurisdiction over issues relating to civil law limited to appeals from Venice, from the Dogado and the Stato da Mar. Access to their judgment was subject to prior scrutiny by the Auditori vecchi alle Sentenze, who in this case held the role of public prosecutor. The New Civil Quarantia had jurisdiction over issues relating to civil law limited to appeals from the Domini di Terraferma. Access to their judgment was subject to prior scrutiny by the Auditori nuovi alle Sentenze and, in matters involving minors, by the Auditori nuovissimi, who in this case held the role of public prosecutor.

It is operated by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles. Currently and historically Latino, it is also the home of the Big Hazard street gang, connected to the Mexican Mafia, and has been the center of the illegal drug market in Southern California. The development abuts the Interstate 10 and is part of LAPD's Hollenbeck Division. Initial construction The Ramona Gardens project was designed by Housing Architects Associated, made up of Ralph Flewelling, George J. Adams, Lloyd Wright, Lewis Eugene Wilson, and Eugene Weston Jr.. They had previously designed the Utah Street housing project under the name of Utah Street Architects Association and designed the Aliso Village project under the name Housing Group Architects. The landscaping was by the firm of Bashford and Barlow.Keylon, Steven. \\"Taming the Car ‚Äî A Vision for Los Angeles: Fred Barlow, Jr.'s Innovative Landscape for Baldwin Hills Village\\". Eden: Journal of the California Garden and Landscape History Society, vol. 16, no. 1 (Winter 2013). The project was originally named Ramona Village, it was changed in November 1939 because it conflicted with the name of a private land development. At the time, Ramona Gardens was billed a \\"slum clearance and low- rent housing project\\". Construction began in February or March 1940, with a groundbreaking ceremony on March 16, 1940 attended by Governor Culbert Olson. It was built on with 610 apartment units in over 100 buildings. The planned cost was $2 million, 90% funded by the United States Housing Authority through the Housing Act of 1937. It was built by the Herbert M. Baruch Corporation. Demonstration units opened in October 1940, with the first six families occupying apartments on 2 January 1941. It was dedicated on 22 February 1941 with both Governor Olson and Mayor Fletcher Bowron in attendance. At that time, 252 of 610 units were occupied, with the remainder expected to be complete within two months. The Christian Science Monitor praised the \\"home conveniences that many of [the residents] never before enjoyed‚Äîelectric refrigerators, new gas ranges, gas water heaters, and wall furnaces‚Äîat rentals ranging from $11 to $18 a month, including all utilities.\\" Two hundred members of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) toured the development in May 1941, including architect and AIA President Richmond Shreve. Community efforts and further development Mural on side of building Jewish residents of Boyle Heights started the racially and economically integrated Heights Cooperative Nursery School for Ramona Gardens children in 1949. It was held at the Jewish Cultural Center nearby in City Terrace until Interstate 10 widening required it to be moved in about 1969. The nursery continued operating through at least 1974. It was used as a training school by education students at California State University, Los Angeles and by the Head Start Program. In 1988, 10 mobile homes or trailers were brought into Ramona Gardens and parked on playfields. They were used as transitional housing for the city's large homeless population. Residents agreed to participate after receiving promises they would be given to families, not \\"the stereotypical single men who live on Skid Row.\\" After the initial number of 610 housing units in just over 100 buildings, varying numbers of units have been given: 488 units in 1985, 497 with about 2000 predominantly Latino residents in 2007. The housing contains public murals that were created by the residents of Ramona Gardens between 1973 and 1977, with the assistance of the Mechiano Arts Center. At least one was painted by Willie Herron inside the administration building. In 1982, motivated by President Ronald Reagan, residents repainted every building in the complex in five months. They used tools and paint from the Housing Authority and sponsored by the East Los Angeles Community Development Project. The Big Hazard gang brought in rivals from Avenidas, Dogtown, and Garrity's to work on the project. Acknowledging the fresh paint and graffiti-free buildings, the Los Angeles Times named the area as the \\"center for drug traffic\\", remarking \\"users from as far away as San Diego drive to [Ramona Gardens] to buy drugs\\". PCP was heavily trafficked, but heroin and marijuana were also common. Both dealers and customers were often from outside of the projects but came to Ramona Gardens for the large and open marketplace, called a \\"24-hour drive-through drug market\\" by a police officer. Police were assigned on daily foot patrols and would often bring their first arrest to the station within 30 minutes of their shift. A tenants' association was formed, as well as a group called Mothers Against PCP and the federally funded Narcotics Prevention Project. Gang activity, drugs, police tension, and crime Buildings in Ramona Gardens The street gang Big Hazard (\\"Hazard Grande\\"), associated with the Mexican Mafia, is from Ramona Gardens. Gang and drug activity historically centered around The Square, an intersection and parking lot in the project. An Alternative Education and Work Center (AEWC) opened at Ramona Gardens in December 1989, giving Big Hazard gang members a place to finish high school, since Lincoln High School is in rival gang territory. Gang-on-gang crime occurs in and near the park. Two teenagers were shot and stabbed to death while attending a baby shower in January 1974, less than a month after another gang-related shooting fatality. The housing project is especially known for a pattern of tension between residents, gang members, and police. In 1991, police shot and killed an unarmed gang member, leading to an FBI investigation and grand jury probe of the police department for it and three other police killings. A firefight between gang members and police in 1996 ended with one gang member dead, a police officer wounded, and an angry crowd. Gang members shot at patrol vehicles in 2006. In 2007, a gang member died while in LAPD custody. The 2007 incident erupted in a riot involving 50 gang members and 100 police equipped in riot control gear. The housing has also had significant racial tension. In 1967, a 17-year-old \\"Mexican boy\\", a suspect to an arson that occurred minutes before, was shot and killed by police. The police showed in large numbers to mediate the tension. The Los Angeles Sentinel said the scene was \\"an ominous, uneasy silence, like a placid lid resting atop a seething volcano.\\" Further saying that help was being provided to the blacks by the Symbionese Liberation Army, and that the sides \\"were at war\\", with only the \\"strong presence of police officers who live in daily and nightly fear of snipers.\\" Nine days later, the officer was cleared by the coroner's jury as a justifiable shooting. In 1991, two black families were firebombed in a racially motivated incident. On May 15, 2014 four apartments in Ramona Gardens were struck by Molotov cocktails. There were no injuries. Most of the victims were African American. Other crime has occurred. In 1974, four teenagers shot and killed a Thai ice cream vendor in what was called a \\"thrill killing\\" while children were waiting for ice cream.

It was designed for protection of the mission San Antonio de Valero and the Villa de Bejar. The Presidio de Bejar was founded on May 5, 1718 by Spanish Governor Martin de Alarcon and his 35 Presidio Soldiers. The Villa de Bejar is known for being the first Spanish settlement of San Antonio and consisted of the families of the Presidio Soldiers and those of the prior expeditions. It also served to secure Spain's claim to the region from French, English and American aggression. Establishment From the Convent of Quer√©taro, several expeditions were organized to the region of Texas, an area of great strategic importance to the Spanish crown. With that goal, in 1675 an expedition formed by Fray Antonio de Olivares, Fray Francisco Hidalgo, Fray Juan Larios, and Fernando del Bosque was sent to explore and describe the country beyond the Rio Grande, to test the possibilities of new settlements in the area. In 1709, Olivares participated in the expedition headed by Pedro de Aguirre, together with Fray Isidro de Espinosa, exploring the territory between the present-day location of the city of San Antonio and the Colorado River. The same year, he traveled to Spain to convince the authorities of the importance of maintaining the territory and establishing new missions on the bank of the San Antonio River. The authorities said \\"yes.\\" He remained in Spain six years (until 1715). In 1716, Fray Antonio de Olivares wrote to the Viceroy of New Spain, telling of their hopes and plans for the future mission, and urged him to send families of settlers to found a town. In the same letter, he stressed that it was necessary for some of these families to be skilled in the useful arts and industries, \\"to teach the Indians all that should be required to be useful and capable citizens.\\" Fray Antonio's perseverance eventually paid off, and the Viceroyalty gave formal approval for the missions in late 1716, assigning responsibility for their establishment to Mart√≠n de Alarc√≥n, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas. Fray Antonio de Olivares organized the construction of the new mission San Antonio de Valero, from the next Mission San Francisco Solano. He also built the first irrigation ditch in Texas (Acequia Madre de Valero), six miles long, to irrigate 400 hectares of land and to supply water to the new facilities. The operating complex was completed with the construction of the Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar, on the west side of the San Antonio River, approximately one-half mile from the mission. It was designed to protect the system of missions and civilian settlements in central Texas and to represent Spanish regional interests, considering the aggression of French, British and Americans. The presidio consisted of an adobe building, thatched with grass, with soldiers and their families quartered in brush huts. As settlers concentrated around the presidio complex and mission, it began to form the town of B√©jar or B√©xar, which became the cornerstone of Spanish Tejas or Texas. Being located in the center of several operating systems, mission B√©xar did not suffer the needs and anxieties of other presidios. Despite occasional Indian attacks, the defenses of the presidio walls were never completed or were deemed necessary, as the mission was partially completed and later converted into the main unit of walled defense. On May 5, the Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar was founded on the west side of the San Antonio River, marking the origin of the present city of San Antonio, Texas. The event was chaired by Martin de Alarc√≥n, settling around 30 families in the surrounding area. On February 14, 1719, the Marquess of San Miguel de Aguayo made a report to the king of Spain, proposing that 400 families be transported from the Canary Islands, Galicia, or Habana to populate the province of Texas. In June 1730, 25 families came to Cuba, and 10 families were sent to Veracruz. Under the leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the group in Veracruz marched overland to the Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar, arriving on March 9, 1731. The group joined the military community resident since 1718, forming the first government of the city and taking as its headquarters the Presidio of San Antonio de B√©xar. In 1726, there were 45 soldiers in the fort and 4 families living nearby; nine soldiers were spread between the missions and the total civilian population was 200 people. Soldiers' quarters and the Spanish Governor's Palace were completed in 1749 to house the military garrison's commanding officer. The location became known as the Plaza de Armas. In 1763, there were 22 soldiers in the presidio, entrusted to defend all five nearby missions. The soldiers at times were used as escorts, and to prevent cattle rustling and smuggling. In 1772, other forts in the area were closed; Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar, however, was left open and became the principal defense in Texas, with a command of 80 soldiers. B√©xar was made the capital of Texas and the presidio captain served as regional governor. In 1790, plans were made to renovate the fort, but were never realized.\\"SAN ANTONIO DE BEXAR PRESIDIO,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/uqs02), accessed April 23, 2011.

In 1803, 100 men from the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras (√Ålamo de Parras) were sent to reinforce the presidio, from Parras de la Fuente in southern Coahuila. Under the jurisdiction of the clergy of the Villa de San Fernando de B√©xar and the Bishop of Nuevo Le√≥n, they occupied the presidio Plaza de Armas (military Plaza) and the secularized mission of San Antonio de Valero.Randell G.

Later, support for the Royalist officers was re-established, and the soldiers joined the army under Manuel Mar√≠a de Salcedo and fought against the Guti√©rrez-Magee Expedition in 1813.Almar√°z, p. 118. In 1825, Erasmo Segu√≠n was appointed quartermaster of San Antonio, a position he held for a decade.de la Teja (1991), p. 5. During the Mexican and Texan wars of independence, the presidio garrison actively participated in numerous military engagements. In 1835 Domingo de Ugartechea, the commandant of the now-former Mexican state of Coahuila y Texas, was headquartered at the presidio, during the Texas Revolution. After the siege and Battle of B√©xar and the expulsion of Mexican troops from Texas in December 1835, Texian Colonel James C. Neill briefly commanded B√©xar and the Alamo. The town and the Alamo fort were recaptured by the Mexican army at the Battle of the Alamo in March 1836 and the Mexican garrison was temporarily reinstated. The presidio officially ceased to exist when the Mexican Army acknowledged Texas independence and presented their formal surrender in San Antonio on June 4, 1836, to B√©xar Military Chief Juan Seguin. Presidio San Antonio de B√©xar is located in modern-day downtown San Antonio, Texas, U.S.A.

Story In 2010, an evil energy being named Draias comes to Earth, joining forces with Dr. Jango, a wicked scientist, in secrecy to bring ruin to the world. The follows him to Earth and their members put their spirits into either the special android vehicles built by the Japanese scientist Hiroshi Amano (which have transformable bodies and were intended to be rescue units), or into different service vehicles like an ambulance, a police car or a firefighter truck. Their commander, Fighbird, merges with a human-shaped android created by Dr. Amano to handle his creations, and from then on lives as the human Yutaro Katori. He transforms into the super robot Fighbird when the enemy attacks, and in the meantime he tries to adapt himself to living with Dr. Amano and his grandchildren Kenta and Haruka so he can interact with humans, learn more about Earth itself, and put a stop to Draias' and Jango's plans for Earth and the Universe itself. Characters * Yutaro Katori is the form that Space Police Force's commander Fighbird takes, after merging his soul with an android that Dr. Hiroshi Amano created to handle his world peace machines. He also takes his human appearance from a drawing made by Dr. Amano's granddaughter Haruka. His skin is made of super silicone foam that disappears when combining with a Fire aircraft, and artificial blood flows through his body. Under his Katori disguise, he publicly poses as Amano's assistant: he tends to make irrelevant, comical remarks because he does not know the Earth well, and sometimes gets himself in trouble due to his extreme naivete about human interactions. His kind nature often gains him friends, however, and he's also ferociously protective of his loved ones and of Earth itself. He controls Fighbird, Granbird, and Great Fighbird, and has the ability of instinctively learning how to handle any kind of technology with next to no training, from simple vehicles to whole computer systems. He is voiced by Yasunori Matsumoto. * As the 65-year-old head of the Amano Peace Science Laboratory, he develops machines to achieve world peace. They always fail, but he learns from this failure and often saves the day, especially after the vehicles he designed and built 'host' the souls of some of Fighbird's Space Police teammates (namely, the Baron Team). He has financial problems with the land he lives on and is also considered an eccentric by neighboring inhabitants and fellow scientists, leading him to be a bit of a glory hound. He is voiced by Ichir≈ç Nagai. * Doctor Amano's cheerful, hotblooded grandson, and the first friend that Katori makes after his arrival to Earth. He acts with Katori as an earth special member of the Space Police Force, helping him in battle and keeping links between him and the Rescue base; he thinks of Katori as an elder brother, calling him \\"big brother Katori\\". Katori gives him a small watch/wrist communicator robot known as . He is voiced by Kazue Ikura. * Kenta's cousin and Doctor Amano's sweet and mature granddaughter, who lives with Dr. Amano because her parents work abroads. Since her grandpa is inventing all the time, she has trouble doing chores. She also has to keep Kenta in line at times. She created the picture that inspired Katori's human appearance, and has a precocious crush on him. She is voiced by Rie Iwatsubo. * Haruka's small pet monkey, apparently a gift from her parents. Voiced by Kazue Ikura. * A beautiful and kind doctor who works at a local hospital. She doubts Katori's identity ever since he tried to donate his artificial blood and she noticed strange things in its sample, but couldn't fully analyze it due to Katori and Kenta taking it away. As time passes, she both learns about the Space Police's mission against Draias and develops romantic feelings for Katori. Unbeknownst to Yoshiko, her ambulance hosts the soul of a Guard team, more specifically Guard Rescue. She is voiced by Masako Katsuki. * A detective of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, who uses tactics that have much to be desired (and often backfire on him), and firmly thinks Dr. Amano is linked to a huge robbery that took place three years ago. Nevertheless, he displays noticeable courage and will to help people when the situation calls for it. Satsuda is unaware that his own police car is also inhabited by the soul of a Space Police Force member, this time Guard Star; as such, he often can't find his car when he needs it. He was voiced by Shigez≈ç Sasaoka. * A plucky and hotheaded TV reporter who constantly goes for the big scoop. She tries to get as close to Fighbird's battles as possible, only to often be put in danger as a result. Momoko develops a crush on Fighbird after he saves her for the first time, calling him \\"her prince\\", and will often hound Kenta for answers as to his identity. She cannot recognize him as Katori, however, despite thinking that she knows him from somewhere. She is voiced by Chie Kojiro. Space Security Force=Fighbird *: The of Fighbird and Granbird.

He joins the cast halfway in the series and has a hot-headed, proud personality that causes him and his companions may problems.  A five-piece team. All the barons except Ace are not fully sentient, acting as if they are actually sentient sub-ordinates. The Team's vehicular disguises can assemble a special team transportation formation known as (For this formation, Barons 2 (Drill) through 5 (Sky) form around Ace Baron - Drill Baron forms the front, Road Baron forms the back and Aqua and Sky Barons form the sides, Aqua Baron to the left and Sky Baron to the right). *: (Voiced by K≈çz≈ç Shioya) The of the Baron Team.

He was voiced by Junpei Takiguchi. * and Draias' muscular and lanky, respectively, assistants who carry out his orders directly and tend to ignore Jango's plans. They command Draias' machine gun- wielding Teshita henchmen and his monsters, the Mecha Beasts. They're voiced by Kiyoyuki Yanada and Yu Shimaka, respectively. *: Literally translated as \\"follower\\", these human-sized robots created by Dr. Jango are for basic labor and serve as infantry.

The game was mistranslated in English as Fire Bird. Draias in his normal form appears as the final boss under the title Dark Fire Bird. In the Game Boy version, Draias can divide himself into his three beast forms. Fighbird later returns in the Brave Saga games with Sodom, Gomorrah, and Draias serving as the only villainous entities in the series to appear and are used in several levels instead of just the final battle; the Death Team, Draias Jet, and Organic Draias do not appear. It is also noted that Fighbird is the only series other than Brave Command Dagwon not to have any storyline or villains in Brave Saga 2. Fighbird also stars in the Harobots games alongside many other anime robots including the Brave series. In popular culture=\\"Is this a pigeon?\\" meme In 2018, a scene from the third episode of the first season in which Yutaro sees a butterfly while speaking to Inspector Satsuda and asks \\"is this a pigeon?\\" became a popular internet meme, spawning many variations.

History The Hudson's Bay Company deeded the land to Joseph Hill who arrived at Red River of the North in 1849 with a Pensioner Regiment. The area was originally called Point-a- Peltier. In 1854, returning to England, Hill put James Armstrong (1790-1874) in charge of the property. Hearing of Hill's death, the property was sold to Francis Evans Cornish, the first mayor of Winnipeg. In the early 1880s, Hill returned to Winnipeg, and reestablished his ownership of the land before selling it to a speculators' syndicate in April 1881 for $28,000. The speculators renamed the area Victoria Place, though officially it was known as Registered Plan 119. The Cornish Library, a local branch of the Winnipeg Public Library During the period of 1880 through 1920, houses were built on its four roads, Cornish Avenue, East Gate, West Gate, and Middle Gate. The first home was completed in 1882. Some of the buildings in Armstrong's Point that are historically significant are: * 20 West Gate, the Cornish Library, completed in 1915 * 40 West Gate, which became the French Consulate * 54 West Gate, the Ralph Connor House, which became a National Historic Site * 86 West Gate which became Westgate Mennonite Collegiate - demolished 1989. * 134 West Gate, which became the Japanese Consulate * 158 West Gate, which became St. John's-Ravenscourt School- demolished 1950. Gates The Gates at East Gate, West Gate, Middle Gate, were designed by the architect Lt. Col. Henry Norland Ruttan in 1911, and built in the same year. Flanking three entrances to the Winnipeg neighbourhood, they are nearly identical construction, built of stone and wrought-iron, and of Classical Revival style. Funded by residents and built by the city's engineering department, the Gates are unique, having been built by the property owners instead of a real estate developer. Politics Armstrong's Point is represented by Sherri Rollins in the constituency of Fort Rouge - East Fort Garry at the municipal level, Lisa Naylor in the constituency of Wolseley at the provincial level, and Leah Gazan in the constituency of Winnipeg Centre at the federal level. Overall, the neighbourhood is politically diverse and does not generally support any candidate with a large majority. Voter turnout for the 2008 federal election was 56%. Demographics The 2016 population of the neighbourhood was 370 people. The median household income in Armstrong's Point was $59,421. References *A Pictorial History of Early Armstrong's Point.

It follows Oscar (a caricature of Oscar Wilde) in his last days leading up until his death, while Cerebus sits catatonic, clutching the doll of Jaka, the woman he loves but believes has been killed. The novel was collected as the sixth paperback \\"phonebook\\" collection in the series in October 1991. Synopsis After Jaka, Rick and Oscar's arrest (and Pud's death), Cerebus returns to the Lower City, where he uses a gold coin to buy room and board at Dino's for the rest of his life. There he sits near-comatose for most of the rest of the story, gripping Jaka's doll Missy. Oscar has become ill... Characters ;Oscar:After being released from prison, Oscar assumes the name Sebastian Melmoth (the real Wilde had used the name Sebastian Melmoth); however, he has become deathly ill and spends his remaining days in a hotel, receiving visits from his doctor and close friends. It is not clear that this Oscar is the same Oscar from Jaka's Story‚ÄîSim was ambiguous \\"with a capital 'A'\\" as to whether they were the same person, and the Oscar of Melmoth referred to the Oscar who was the author of Jaka's Story in the third person. ;Cerebus:After seeing the destruction of Jaka's home, he has become near-catatonic. He uses the gold coin he found to pay for room and board at Dino's for the rest of his life, where he sits quietly and vacantly with Jaka's doll, Missy. ;Dino:The owner of the caf√© where Cerebus has chosen to spend the rest of his life. ;Doris: ;Janice: ;Reggie:Close friend of Oscar's. ;Robbie Ross:Close friend of Oscar's. ;Dr. Tucker:Oscar's doctor. There were also brief appearances by numerous characters from the series, including the Roach, Mick & Keef, Posey and others. Artwork At this point, according to Gerhard, Sim and Gerhard had \\"an unspoken understanding\\" when it came the backgroundsSim would occasionally make suggestions (such as the white fog that surrounded Cerebus at times to reflect his emotional state), but for the most part Gerhard was left to decide on how to handle the backgrounds himself. The building designs were based on what Gerhard could find in library architecture books. He couldn't find anything specific about the doctor's office or Wilde's final resting place, aside from Wilde's \\"famous last line\\" indicating that the \\"wallpaper had to be really ugly.\\" He drew inspiration from Barry Windsor Smith for the series covers. Publication The story was originally serialized in Cerebus #139‚Äì150. The issues were further numbered Melmoth Zero (Cerebus #139, October 1990) through Melmoth Eleven (Cerebus #150, September 1991), although this numbering is not acknowledged in the collection. The collection appeared in October 1991. It included an 11-page text section with reproductions of letters from The Collected Letters of Oscar Wilde that Sim used as the basis for the Wilde portions of the story, showing the changes he made to make them fit into the fictional world of Estarcion, plus annotations. The first printing, October 1991, was a signed (by both Dave Sim and Gerhard) and numbered (out of 410) by hand on the inside title page. No volume number was printed on the spine until later printings. Sim's sources *Hart-Davis, Rupert. Collected Letters of Oscar Wilde. (1962)Sim, Melmoth, page 249 NotesReferences *Sim, Dave; Gerhard.

It originally aired on Thursday, September 24, 2009. The episode was written by Barbie Kligman and Bryan M. Holdman and directed by John Dahl. Plot Caroline (Candice Accola) awakens after the night she spent with Damon (Ian Somerhalder) to find bite marks on her neck. She tries to escape from her room before Damon hears her, but he thwarts her attempt and attacks her again. Bonnie (Kat Graham) worries about Elena (Nina Dobrev) being with Stefan (Paul Wesley) after the bad feeling she got when she touched his hand. She tries to talk Elena out of committing to dating him but Elena is not convinced and instead she arranges a dinner at her place where Bonnie will get the chance to get to know Stefan better and see that there is nothing wrong with him. Vicki (Kayla Ewell) invites Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) to a concert as friends. But he gets angry, because he wants to be more than her friend and out of frustration, he accuses her of only sleeping with him for the drugs. Tyler (Michael Trevino) picks on Matt (Zach Roerig) for his lack of action as Elena and Stefan grow noticeably closer. When Tyler throws a football at Stefan‚Äôs head in an attempt to make a fool out of him, Stefan deftly catches it, surprising everyone. Elena suggests that Stefan should join the football team in order to make friends, something that Stefan does even though at the beginning he is not very positive to the idea. Stefan asks Mr. Tanner (Benjamin Ayres) to let him join the team but Mr. Tanner says no since Stefan embarrassed him during history class. But Mr. Tanner lets him try out and being impressed by his skills, Mr. Tanner lets Stefan join the team. Meanwhile, at cheer practice, Caroline shows up late because of Damon and Elena messes up the routine and eventually stops to watch Stefan play football. Elena and Bonnie prepare the dinner while waiting for Stefan and Bonnie tells Elena that she keeps seeing the numbers 8, 14 and 22, but she does not know what they mean. Stefan arrives but the dinner is awkward until Elena mentions that Bonnie's grandmother claims that their family are witches that come from Salem. Stefan tells Bonnie that her family heritage of witches is something to be proud of and Bonnie becomes more comfortable around Stefan. Caroline and Damon arrive unexpectedly and Stefan tries to convince Elena not to invite him in the house but she does not listen. During the evening‚Äôs conversation, Damon makes a cryptic comment referencing their past with Katherine. Elena guesses that Damon also loved Katherine, surprising him by expressing her sympathy for him having lost her too. Meanwhile, Stefan confirms his suspicion that Damon is feeding off of Caroline and attempts to convince him that humans are not to be used as toys. In response, Damon reminds Stefan that he has been invited into Elena's house and he can come back whenever he wants to and do whatever he wants. He comes back in the evening and invades in one of Elena's dreams. Stefan ponders how to make Damon see his own humanity and how to protect Elena. At the football game, he gives her a necklace with vervain in it so Damon will not be able to affect her. Prior to the game, Mr. Tanner gives a pep talk that highlights Stefan‚Äôs talents, infuriating Tyler. A drunken Jeremy attacks Tyler because of the way he treats Vicki and a fight ensues between them. Stefan attempts to break it up but he cuts his hand. Elena sees his injured hand but when she tries to check on him, the wound is already healed, making her suspicious. This suspicion leads Elena to question Bonnie about her strange feeling she got for Stefan, and Bonnie tells her that it felt like death. Damon follows Elena to her car and attempts to compel her, and then he tries to kiss her. Elena slaps him and reminds him that she is not Katherine. Damon figures out that the necklace Stefan gave her contains vervain and that's why he was not able to compel her. He confronts Stefan and threatens to harm Elena. Stefan tells him that no matter how tough he is trying to be, he still has humanity in him. Damon, to prove him wrong, kills Mr. Tanner in front of his eyes. Matt discovers Mr. Tanner‚Äôs body and calls for help. As the ambulance takes the body away, Bonnie watches in shock when she sees a sign for building eight, the number 14 on a license plate, and parking space 22 where Mr. Tanner was killed; the three numbers she was seeing the whole day. Elena is confused and upset by the evening‚Äôs events, and Stefan assures her that they will be fine. After what happened, Stefan later writes in his journal that he is now convinced that there is nothing good left in Damon and that he must be stopped. While at the same time, Damon is at Elena's room watching her sleep, (hinting he may have some type of feelings for her) but he leaves just as she wakes up.

Reviews  \\"Friday Night Bites\\" received positive reviews with some of them commenting on the chemistry between Damon and Elena. Lucia from Heroine TV stated that it was her favorite episode yet: \\"The third episode is my favorite episode of The Vampire Diaries yet. Vampires plus Friday Night Lights? The death of the most annoying character on television? Sweet Matt standing up to Tyler, and making friends with Stefan? What‚Äôs not to love? I‚Äôm a very happy viewer.\\" Lauren Attaway from Star Pulse gave a B rate to the episode saying that \\"the big event of the episode was Stefan joining the football team.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 stating praising the character of Damon: \\"Although the series hasn‚Äôt hit its stride yet, this episode represents an improvement over the first two, largely as a result of the development of the character of Damon Salvatore. The character emerges as one of the most charmingly complex on television in two nicely juxtaposed scenes at Elena‚Äôs dinner party. [...] The character work done on Damon elevates this episode above its predecessors, and that character and all his charisma and contradictions will carry the series through the next few episodes\\" Popsugar gave a good review to the episode stating: \\"I'm pretty psyched ‚Äî with its third episode, \\"Friday Night Bites,\\" Diaries has become one of my favorites of the Fall season [...] I'm really intrigued for the next few episodes ‚Äî I want to know more about this Katherine-Damon-Stefan love triangle and, surprisingly, Bonnie.\\" She also commented on the chemistry between Damon and Elena: \\"...the sexual tension between Elena and Damon is out of control, rejections notwithstanding. Her chemistry with Stefan is also great, but the Damon-Elena dynamic is worthy of Eric and Sookie on that other vampire show [True Blood].\\" Zeba of Two Cents TV also gave a good review to the episode saying that it was a step up from last week. Zeba also commented on the chemistry between Damon and Elena and compared it to the triangle of the show True Blood: \\"The dynamic between the two of them is pretty darn interesting ‚Äì Damon is clearly trying to play the predator, the manipulator, but Elena can almost see all the way through his facade. Somehow she manages to bring out something semi-human in him. [...] Things are finally picking up in terms of plot and character development, and I cannot wait to see where the Damon and Elena storyline goes. The whole situation is very reminiscent of the Beel/Sookeh/Eric set up on True Blood.\\" Tiffany Vogt of The TV Watchtower wrote a good review saying: \\"Giving a new meaning to the phrase ‚Äúwalk of shame‚Äù this week‚Äôs episode opened with a classic horror movie scene [...] The horror-level is certainly not diminishing as we delve deeper into the series. If anything, it is more prevalent. For just when you think it is safe to breathe again, something jumps out and attacks ‚Äî and all you can hear is your heart beating loudly as you jump with fright.\\" On the Damon/Elena chemistry she wrote: \\"Surprisingly, the scenes between Damon and Elena were a lot more interesting and sizzling than one would expect. The kitchen scene where he tells Elena about Katherine was more poignant, especially after Elena softly told Damon: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and when he looks back at her puzzled, she explained, ‚Äú ‚Äì about Katherine. You lost her too.‚Äù Damon looks utterly surprised and oddly touched.\\" Frankie Diane Mallis from First Novels Club said that although it was not her favorite episode it was still pretty excellent. Book references *In The Awakening, Elena no longer finds herself as enthusiastic about school activities as she once was, which is reflected in this episode. *In the books, Stefan joins the football team as wide receiver. Matt Honeycutt is the quarterback. *Mystic Falls High School's team colors are black and red, same as Robert E. Lee High School. *Mr. Tanner was also killed in the books by Damon. *In the novels, Bonnie's heritage leads back to the Celtic Druids and Stefan mentions them in the episode when he is talking to Bonnie during dinner at the Gilbert house. *In 'The Struggle', Damon haunts Elena's dream before Stefan gives her vervain as protection. *At the beginning of 'The Struggle', Elena confronts Damon and gives him \\"a good hard slap\\", which is also her move when he accosts her in the parking lot after the football game. *Just as Stefan tries to get through to his brother in this episode, in 'Dark Reunion' he tells him, \\"You can pretend you don't care. You can fool the whole world. But I know differently.\\" Trivia * Zach Roerig (Matt Donovan) played Cash for six episodes in the Friday Night Lights TV series and Julie Plec is a dedicated fan. * Julie Plec has said this episode is a favorite,Plec, Julie (2009-09-24).

There are several important and famous female players from the country. History By 1888, American women tennis players were agitating for their own championship competition. USLTA claimed that they lacked the authority to organise such a competition. In 1923, the Wightman Cup was created as a national women's tennis competition between the United States and Great Britain. The trophy for the event was paid for by Hazel Wightman, an American tennis champion. The location of the cup was alternated between countries on a yearly basis. Great Britain won in 1924, 1925, 1928 and 1930. In all other years that the cup was contested, the Americans claimed victory. Important players Players Pam Shriver, Martina Navratilova, and Monica Seles Helen Wills Moody was an important American tennis player. She helped to popularize the overhand serve for women during the 1940s. Alice Marble is another important influential American tennis player. In 1939, she was a triple champion at Wimbledon. Her style of play was characterized as masculine because of her aggressive pursuit of the ball during serves and volleys. Like Helen Wills Moody, others would go on to copy her style of play.

Ramuji wanted to make a sequel to Money, as no sequel had happened in India. And he wanted Vamsi to direct Money Money. Vamsi expressed his reservations that he did not want to launch himself with this kind of film. Then Ramu told him that he had to direct it. So Vamsi kept a condition that Vamsi's name must not be there in the titles (ghost direction). He assured him that if he saw the finished product, he himself would ask for the credit. Then Money Money was started under Vamsi's direction. He tried all types of techniques and experimented with it. In that film he shot one song with just four shots (Kota song \\"Em Kompa Munagadoi\\") and another one with 357 shots (Chakri and Surabhi duet \\"Left and Right Endukanta\\" at Golkonda Fort). The Kota song took 6 hours to shoot and the Chakri duet took 6 days. Ramuji scolded Vamsi about his inconsistency. Ramuji gave him a choice to change his mind about the director's name. After Vamsi's refusal, Ramuji requested Siva Nageswara Rao to lend his name and it was released.

Both were former executives of American Microsystems, Inc. (AMI), a custom semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. Also, part of the founding team were Gregory Houston, VP Marketing, a former Calma executive, and Chi-Song Horng, Director of software engineering (later promoted as a Vice President), a former AMI software engineering manager. P-CAD was a play on personal computers, which were just becoming popular, following the launch of the IBM PC. The vision of the company was to disrupt the existing hegemony of $250,000 CAD systems based on mainframe computers and custom workstations, and make electronic CAD available to the masses at a cost under $10,000. The startup originally raised US$500,000 from CrossPoint Venture Partners, and US$3,000,000 in a second round from New Enterprise Associates and Robertson, Coleman and Stephens. The board of directors included John Mumford (Crosspoint), Dick Kramlich (NEA) and Sy Kaufman (Robertson, et al.). P-CAD went on to become the company with the biggest installed base of users of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), with over 10,000 users by 1988. At that time, P-CAD was the most prolific EDA company as measured by its user base, easily surpassing established CAD companies such as Autotrol, Calma, Intergraph, Daisy, Mentor, Cadnetix, CAE Systems, ECAD, SDA Systems, etc. At that time, Cadence was just being formed with the merger of ECAD and SGA, and Synopsys was being founded as a new start up. P-CAD's flagship products included schematic capture, logic simulation and PCB layout. Its single biggest customer was Texas Instruments. Other customers included most of the top electronic companies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. P-CAD also signed up IBM as a distribution partner, especially for Japan. Some of the key later additions to the P-CAD team who were instrumental in building up the company include former IBM and Xerox executive Jim Dick, former Apollo Computer VP, Mike Lack, former Apollo Computer Western Regional Sales Manager, Arthur Clark, and EDA industry veteran Ellis Smith, who managed P-CAD's Asia business. Key engineering managers included Bob Dean, Bill Newhard, Howard Schutzman, Alvin Hung, Felix Ruslim, Ron Rinaldi and Mark Houde. Key marketing/sales managers included Kirk Shorte, Steve Mayer, Bruce Fihe, Kathy Eggiman, Elizabeth Dessuge, Ken Lowe, Susan Scal, Donna Licot, Shahriar Emami, and John Roth, who as Director of Sales, was instrumental in bringing the first $5 million of sales into the company. In 1989, P-CAD was acquired by Cadam, which was a subsidiary of Lockheed, but was in the process of being sold to IBM. At the time of acquisition, P-CAD had an installed base of over 100,000 end users, a record at that time. In those days, such a large user base was unheard of in the EDA industry. A few years later, the P-CAD group was divested by selling to ACCEL Technologies, an EDA software corporation from San Diego, California, which was acquired by Protel International Pty Ltd (now Altium) in 2000. The P-CAD product included schematic capture, component library management, PCB layout and routing, parametric constraint solver and auto-routing capability. The last version of P-CAD was P-CAD 2006 with Service Pack 2, released in 2006. This was the last release made by Altium, who retired the product in favor of Altium Designer. This was the final outcome that was originally expected at the time of the merger of Protel with ACCEL ‚Äî that the best features of both product lines would eventually be combined.

The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Originally the entire 42,000-square-foot building was occupied by Aron and Edward Rosenwald's flagship department store, which was praised by the Albuquerque Journal as \\"the handsomest, most up-to-date, and most complete department store in the southwest\\" upon opening.

A squadron of United States Navy warships attacked the harbor defenses of Karavia Bay and exchanged naval gunfire and torpedoes with two Japanese destroyers. The nighttime engagement ended with the silencing of the Japanese artillery and resulted in a blockade of the port. Two Japanese transports were also sunk in the fighting. Later, Allied forces landed on the island and destroyed the enemy garrison. Battle Captain Rodger F.

Incorporated in 1919 to take over the operations of Daimler's hire department, Daimler Hire was a subsidiary of The Daimler Company Limited. The company's services later included self-drive hire cars, which continued to the end of the company's existence. Aviation services introduced in 1919 and motor yacht rental services introduced in 1922 were sold in 1924. Majority shareholding in Daimler Hire was sold to Thomas Tilling Limited in 1930; in 1949 The Daimler Company sold its remaining shares to the same company. In the 1950s, Humber Pullman and Humber Super Snipe limousines were added to its fleet. In 1958, the company was sold to Hertz, an American car rental company, as a base to enter the British market. Daimler Hire was discontinued in 1976. Origin Formally inaugurated in December 1907, Daimler's hire department began when half a dozen of the Coventry workforce were ‚Äùput through a thorough course of tuition on the motor and driving‚Äù so that carriages could be ‚Äúlet out on hire with a competent driver for a period not exceeding three months at a charge of ¬£5 per week ‚Äì this amount , less driver‚Äôs wages to be refunded in the event of purchase‚Äù. The London operation began as a reserve pool of cars and staff of drivers to provide support for the mews at Buckingham Palace and other Daimler owners when their cars need servicing. Its services soon extended to prosperous London residents who did not wish to have the trouble of keeping their own car and driver. Visitors toured Europe in their Daimler Hire limousines with chauffeur-guide. Daimler viewed it as ‚Äúa demonstration to all the world of the utility comfort and reliability of the Daimler car‚Äù. Daimler Hire was formed in 1919 to perform the functions of the hire department. 250 new Daimler limousines were added to the fleet In that year. London operations were based at 243 Knightsbridge, SW7 ‚Äî the former Prince's Skating Club ‚Äî and 68 Brompton Road, SW3. During the 1919 rail strike they ran shuttle services between London and Birmingham and London and Manchester with \\"high-powered limousines and landaulettes\\" \\"for business trips and journeys of importance in the national emergency\\". In 1923, George V granted a Royal Warrant to Daimler Hire. Daimler Hire delivered newsprint throughout the country during the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. Aviation From 1919 its services were extended to Daimler Air Hire Limited, a luxury aircraft-hire or charter service to which was soon added a scheduled airline, Daimler Airway Limited, an airway service to France as a natural extension to the facilities for comfortable private transport already afforded by the company through its unique fleet of luxury touring cars. Daimler Airway, in 1924, became the major constituent of the new national air carrier, Imperial Airways Limited when Daimler Hire‚Äôs managing director, Frank Searle and manager George E. Woods Humphery, took the same positions with Imperial Airways. Car radio receivers In March 1923 a dozen or so radio- equipped cars were put in service. Motor yachting In the summer of 1922 Daimler Hire offered a new service to those who now found running a yacht of their own too expensive, The first vessel was the Dame Lora which first departed on Wednesday 11 August down Southampton Water for a cruise in the Solent. It was intended to be the first of a fleet of new yachts, 80 feet long with a beam of thirteen feet and a gross tonnage of 64 tons, powered by the 105 hp Daimler engine used in wartime tanks. There were two single and two double cabins, Marconiphones were provided for \\"listening in\\"and a gramophone to supply music for dancing. The yachts were to be constructed so that they would be able to take parties to the south of France for the winter through the French canals. The yacht hire service was sold in 1924. Coronation Daimler Hire provided 150 Daimler Straight Eights to carry foreign dignitaries attending the coronation of King George VI in 1937. Over a thousand privately owned Daimlers arranged by Daimler Hire were also used in connection with the coronation.Both sources mention the chartering of 150 Daimlers and a thousand Daimlers involved with the Coronation celebration, but neither source mentions Daimler Hire specifically. Ownership Originally a wholly owned subsidiary of The Daimler Company Limited, in 1930 75% of Daimler Hire's ordinary shares were sold to Thomas Tilling Limited which operated a similar London private- hire-car business. They purchased the balance of the capital from Daimler in 1949. In early 1958, Daimler Hire was bought by Hertz Group of America as their entry into the British car hire market. By the time of the purchase, the company's chauffeurs had covered 2.3 million miles a year, while their self- drive customers drove another 7.5 million. Daimler Hire Limited retained its separate trading identity until 1976.

Its drugs in development include enobosarm (ostarine) and GTx-758. The company was founded in Memphis in 1997 by Mitch Steiner and Marc S. Hanover. The company was originally called Genotherapeutics, changed its name to GTx, Inc. in 2001, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2003. The company licensed toremifene from Orion Corporation, and licensed andarine, enobosarm and prostarine from the University of Tennessee Research Foundation; the SARM compounds from Tennessee had been invented by Karen Veverka and Michael Whitt and each later joined the company. The company held its IPO in February 2004. In 2006 GTx signed a partnership with Ipsen to develop toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulatorm to prevent prostate cancer and to prevent bone loss in men with prostate cancer; the FDA rejected the application to market the drug for this use in 2009, and Ipsen terminated the arrangement in 2011. In 2012 GTx sold its rights to toremifene to ProStrakan, a subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin, for around $19 million, and terminated its agreement with Orion. By 2007 enobosarm was in a Phase II trial, and that year Gtx signed an exclusive license agreement for its SARM program with Merck; Merck bought $30M in GtX stock, paid an upfront fee of $40M, and agreed to fund $15M in research over the next three years. The agreement also included royalties on any product brought to market and around $400M in biodollars. The companies ended the deal in 2010. In August 2013 GTx announced that enobosarm had failed in two Phase III clinical trials to treat wasting in people with lung cancer. In October 2013 the company laid off around 60% of its 88-person workforce, and Steiner resigned 6 months later. The company had invested around $35 million in the development of the drug. The company said at that time that is planned to pursue approval of enobosarm in Europe; the company was also still developing GTx-758 for castration-resistant prostate cancer. In 2016 GTx began Phase II trials, to see if enosobarm might be effective to treat stress urinary incontinence in women. In June 2019, GTx combined with Oncternal Therapeutics in a reverse merger. The combined company will operate under the name Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc.

Given a set of items in a list where the cost of accessing an item is proportional to its distance from the head of the list, e.g. a Linked List, and a request sequence of accesses, the problem is to come up with a strategy of reordering the list so that the total cost of accesses is minimized. The reordering can be done at any time but incurs a cost. The standard model includes two reordering actions: * A free transposition of the item being accessed anywhere ahead of its current position; * A paid transposition of a unit cost for exchanging any two adjacent items in the list. Performance of algorithms depend on the construction of request sequences by adversaries under various Adversary models An online algorithm for this problem has to reorder the elements and serve requests based only on the knowledge of previously requested items and hence its strategy may not have the optimum cost as compared to an offline algorithm that gets to see the entire request sequence and devise a complete strategy before serving the first request. Along with its original uses, this problem has been suggested to have a strong similarity to problems of improving global context and compressibility following a Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Following this transform, files tend to have large regions with locally high frequencies, and compression efficiency is greatly improved by techniques that tend to move frequently-occurring characters toward zero, or the front of the \\"list\\". Due to this, methods and variants of Move-to-Front and frequency counts often follow the BWT algorithm to improve compressibility. Adversary models An adversary is an entity that gets to choose the request sequence \\\\sigma for an algorithm ALG. Depending of whether \\\\sigma can be changed based on the strategy of ALG, adversaries are given various powers, and the performance of ALG is measured against these adversaries. An oblivious adversary has to construct the entire request sequence \\\\sigma before running ALG, and pays the optimal offline price, OPT(\\\\sigma) which is compared against ALG(\\\\sigma) An adaptive online adversary gets to make the next request based on the previous results of the online algorithm, but pays for the request optimally and online. An adaptive offline adversary gets to make the next request based on the previous results of the online algorithm, but pays the optimal offline cost. Offline algorithms Competitive analysis for many list update problems were carried out without any specific knowledge of the exact nature of the optimum offline algorithm (OPT). There exist algorithm runs in O(n2l(l-1)!) time and O(l!) space where n is the length of the request sequence and l is the length of the list.N. Reingold and J. Westbrook. Optimum Offline algorithms for the list update and paging rules. Technical Report YALE/DcS/TR-805, Yale University, New Haven, Conn, August 1990 The best known optimal offline algorithm dependent on request sequence length runs in O(l^2(l‚àí1)!n) time published by Dr Srikrishnan Divakaran in 2014. Paid transpositions are in general necessary for optimum algorithms. Consider a list (a,b,c) where a is at the head of the list, and a request sequence c,b,c,b. An optimal offline algorithm using only free exchanges would cost 9 (3+3+2+1), whereas an optimal offline algorithm using only paid exchanges would cost 8. So, we cannot get away with just using free transpositions for the optimum offline algorithm. The optimum list update problem was proven to be NP-hard by . Online algorithm An online algorithm ALG has a competitive ratio c if for any input it performs at least as good as c times worse than OPT. i.e. if there exists an \\\\alpha\\\\geq0 such that for all finite length request sequences \\\\sigma, ALG(\\\\sigma)-c.OPT(\\\\sigma)\\\\leq\\\\alpha. Online algorithms can either be deterministic or randomized and it turns out that randomization in this case can truly help against oblivious adversaries. Deterministic Most deterministic algorithms are variants of these three algorithms : ; MTF (Move to front) : After accessing an item move it to the front of the list without changing the order of other items ; TRANS (Transpose) : After accessing an item, transpose it with the immediately preceding item. ; FC (Frequency Count) : For each item maintain a frequency count of the number of accesses to it - when an element is accessed increase its frequency count and reorder the list in the decreasing order of frequencies. Observe that all these use just free transpositions. It turns out that both TRANS and FC are not competitive. In a classic result using Potential method analysis proved that MTF is 2-competitive. The proof does not require the explicit knowledge of OPT but instead counts the number of inversions i.e. elements occurring in opposite order in the lists of MTF and OPT. Any deterministic algorithm has a lower bound of 2-\\\\frac{2}{l+1} for a list of length l, and MTF is actually the optimum deterministic list update algorithm. The type of adversary doesn't matter in the case of deterministic algorithms, because the adversary can run a copy of the deterministic algorithm on his own to precompute the most disastrous sequence. Randomized Consider the following simple randomized algorithm : ; BIT : For every item in the list, maintain a bit. Initialize all the bits uniformly and randomly to 0 or 1. When an item is accessed, flip the bit, and if it is 1 move it to the front, else don't. This algorithm is barely random - it makes all its random choices in the beginning and not during the run. It turns out that BIT breaks the deterministic bound - it is better than MTF against oblivious adversaries. It is 7/4-competitive. There are other randomized algorithms, like COMB, that perform better than BIT. Boris Teia proved a lower bound of 1.5 for any randomized list update algorithm.Teia, Boris, A lower bound for randomized list update algorithms, Inf. Process. Lett. (1993), pp. 5 --9 Related Problems The list update problem where elements maybe inserted and deleted is called the dynamic list update problem, as opposed to the static list update problem where only accessing list elements are allowed. The upper bound of 2-\\\\frac{2}{l+1} holds for the dynamic model as well. There are different cost models as well. In the usual full cost model, an access to an element located at a position i costs i, but the last comparison is inevitable for any algorithm, i.e. there are i-1 elements standing in the way of i. In the partial cost model, these final comparison costs totaling to the number of elements in the request sequence are ignored. For the costs of paid transpositions other than unity, Pd models are used.

Often referred to only as \\"The Duke of Wellington\\", he led a successful military career in India during the Fourth Anglo‚ÄìMysore War (1798‚Äì99) and the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803‚Äì1805), and in Europe during the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815). Starting his career in 1787 as a commissioned officer in the infantry, before seeing his first action in the Flanders Campaign, Wellesley rose in rank by purchasing his first four commissions, as was common practice in the British Army for wealthy officers.Holmes, pp. 17‚Äì19, 21. His continued rise in status and fame thereafter was the result of his ability and success as an army commander. Between 1794 and 1815, Wellesley participated in a number of military campaigns where he achieved tactical, strategic, and decisive victories in India and across six countries of western Europe.Morgan, pp. 95‚Äì116. See: Timeline of Wellington & British Campaigns. Wellesley faced and defeated many of Napoleon's marshals as the commander in chief of the Anglo-Portuguese Army during the Peninsular War, but his best known battle was at Waterloo in 1815 where he led an Anglo-Allied force to a decisive victory over Napoleon I. It was to be his last battle. Military career There is speculation by historians and biographers about how many battles Wellington actually participated in during his career. Military historian Ian Fletcher identifies twenty-four major battles and sieges involving the British Army between 1808 and 1815 with Wellington in command of seventeen.Fletcher (2005), pp. 17‚Äì117. Military historian, Mark Adkin, comments that \\"Wellington had fought in some twenty-four battles and sieges prior to Waterloo\\".Adkin, p. 92. Although this is easily contested, the precise number of battles may never be known. It can be established from records, dispatches and reports dating back to the events that he was present in at least fifty separate military actions, including an assortment of meeting engagements, pitched battles, sieges, skirmishes and minor engagements, throughout his career. He also ordered countless other remote engagements mostly whilst serving in the Napoleonic Wars, during which Britain played a major role in securing Europe against French occupation, between 1805 and 1815.Smith, pp. 201‚Äì560. Commissions and promotions Wellesley was gazetted ensign on 7 March 1787, in the 73rd (Highland) Regiment of Foot, and became an aide-de-camp in October.Holmes, p. 21. He purchased his commission to lieutenant on 25 December 1787, in the 76th Regiment. As a junior officer he transferred to the 41st Regiment soon after to avoid duty in the East Indies, and in June 1789 transferred again, to the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Light Dragoons cavalry regiment.Holmes, p. 22. He obtained his commission to captain on 30 June 1791, in the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment, having served the regulation minimum of three years,Holmes, p. 18, 24. and again to major on 30 April 1793, in the 33rd (First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment, having served six years.Holmes, p. 18, 25. He purchased his final commission to lieutenant-colonel on 30 September 1793,Holmes, p. 28. at the age of 24.Savoury & Isles, p. 4. From there on further promotion could only be attained through seniority, per Army Regulations.Holmes, p. 19. In September 1794, Wellesley experienced his first battle, against the French, at the Battle of Boxtel with the 33rd.Holmes, p. 30. His promotion to colonel, on 3 May 1796, came by seniority, and in June he was sent with the 33rd to India.Holmes, p. 34. In 1799 he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, commanding three victorious actions with the British East India Company. In 1800, whilst serving as Governor of Mysore, Wellesley was tasked with putting down an insurgency led by Dhoondiah Waugh, formerly a Patan trooper for Tipu Sultan.Weller, p. 88 After the fall of Seringapatam he became a powerful brigand, having raised a sizeable force composed of disbanded Mysore soldiers, raiding villages along the Maratha‚ÄìMysore border region, captured small outposts and forts in Mysore, and was receiving the support of several Maratha killedars opposed to British occupation.Davies, p. 22. This drew the attention of the British administration, his threats to destabilise British authority increased.Weller, pp. 94‚Äì96. Given independent command of a combined East India Company and British Army force,Weller, p. 97. Wellesley campaigned to destroy Waugh in June 1800, with an army of 8,000 infantry and cavalry, having learned that Waugh's forces numbered over 50,000, although the majority (around 30,000) were irregular light cavalry and unlikely to pose a serious threat to British infantry and artillery.Davies, pp. 33, 38. Throughout June‚ÄìAugust 1800, Wellesley advanced through Waugh's territory, his troops escalading forts in turn and capturing each one with \\"trifling loss\\".Wellesley & Gurwood (ed), Vol. I, pp. 181, 190. Dhoondiah continued to retreat, but his forces were rapidly deserting, he had no infantry and due to the monsoon weather flooding river crossings he could no longer outpace the British advance.Weller, p. 99. On 10 September, at the Battle of Conaghul, Wellesley personally led a charge of 1,400 British dragoons and Indian cavalry, in single line with no reserve, against Dhoondiah and his remaining 5,000 cavalry. Dhoondiah was killed during the clash, his body was discovered and taken to the British camp tied to a cannon. With this victory Wellesley's campaign was concluded, British authority had been restored.Davies, pp. 37‚Äì38. After winning the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, and serving as governor of Seringapatam and Mysore, Wellesley was promoted to major-general on 29 April 1802, although he did not receive the news until September.Holmes, p. 69. Whilst in India he wrote of his regiment \\"I have commanded them for nearly ten years during which I have scarcely been away from them and I have always found them to be the quietest and best behaved body of men in the army.\\"Savoury & Isles, p. 5. Wellesley gained further success in India during the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803‚Äì05, and in 1806 Wellesley succeeded the Marquis Cornwallis as Colonel of the 33rd, which he held until 1813. By 1807, Napoleon's attempt to prevent continental Europe from trading with Britain had resulted in all but Sweden, Denmark and Portugal closing their ports. In June 1807, Napoleon pressured Denmark further, resulting in the British naval bombardment of Copenhagen and seizure of the Danish fleet to prevent it from falling into French hands.Rothenberg, pp. 114‚Äì115. Wellesley's brief role against Danish land forces at the Battle of K√∏ge helped secure Denmark. Wellesley later disapproved of the bombardment, saying \\"we might have taken the capital with greater ease.\\"Holmes, pp. 100‚Äì101. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 25 April 1808,Holmes, p. 102. and in June was given command of 9,000 men set to invade revolutionary Spanish America.Longford, p. 138. But in 1807, Napoleon had invaded Portugal, via Spain, intent on preventing its continued trade with Britain. He replaced the Spanish royal family with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, in May 1808.Rothenberg, pp. 113‚Äì114. In Madrid, the people attempted a rebellion against the French occupation which spread across Spain resulting in mass executions in reprisal, leading both the Portuguese and Spanish juntas (local administrations) to call on British support.Holmes, pp. 105‚Äì106.Hibbert, pp. 67‚Äì68. On 31 July 1811, he was promoted to general, although it only applied in the Peninsula.Holmes, p. 189. His final promotion to field marshal came on 21 June 1813, following his success at the Battle of Vitoria which had broken the remaining French hold in Spain.Holmes, p. 187. Wellington was awarded with a Marshal's baton ‚Äì partially designed by the Prince Regent himself ‚Äì the first of its kind in the British Army. Allied commander In August 1808, Wellesley entered the Peninsular War, landing at Mondego Bay, north of Lisbon, with 13,000‚Äì15,000 men.Holmes, pp. 112‚Äì121.Hibbert, p. 70. Just three weeks after landing, Wellesley defeated the French at the Battle of Vimeiro. Aware of his weak position, French g√©n√©ral de division (divisional general) Junot called for an armistice and negotiations began which lead to the Convention of Cintra and his army's withdrawal from Portugal.Holmes, pp. 120‚Äì121. Wellesley returned to England, arriving on 4 October, but his victory at Vimeiro was overshadowed because of the controversial terms of the Convention of Cintra, a treaty that he had signed which arranged for French troops to be evacuated back to France on Royal Navy vessels, rather than kept as prisoners, along with all their equipment, weapons and personal possessions, which included anything they might have plundered from Portugal since its occupation in 1807.Holmes, p. 121. The Convention was subject to ridicule by the newspapers,Holmes, pp. 122‚Äì123. as were the three officers who had signed it, namely Wellesley and two superior generals: Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple. A public inquiry was held in November to determine their roles in the Convention. Wellesley gave evidence stating that he and Burrard had played no part in negotiating terms with the French generals, that Dalrymple had discussed the contents of the treaty alone. He had approved of a French evacuation but felt the terms were too generous; though he considered the treaty \\"an extraordinary paper\\" his signature was a formality. A Board of General Officers voted 4:3 in favour of the Convention and concluded proceedings on 22 December.Hibbert, pp. 78‚Äì79. Furthermore, they commended Wellesley's role at Vimeiro and he later received the thanks of Parliament for his victory.Holmes, p. 124. When the head of the British forces in the Peninsula, Sir John Moore, was killed in the Battle of Corunna in January 1809,Holmes, p. 125. the British Army having been driven from the Peninsula in disarray,Fletcher (2005), p. 30. Wellesley sent the Secretary of War a memo insisting that a British force of no less than 30,000 British troops should be sent to defend and rebuild Portugal's military strength.Holmes, pp. 125‚Äì126. His proposal was approved and he re-embarked to Lisbon on 14 April 1809, having been appointed to head of all British forces in Portugal on 6 AprilHolmes, pp. 129‚Äì130. ‚Äì a motion supported by the government and King George III, as Wellesley did not hold seniority. Due to a second invasion of Portugal by the French he remained to continue the Peninsular War for a further five years, engaging the French armies across Portugal, Spain, and north into France until Napoleon's abdication in 1814.Holmes, pp. 193‚Äì194. After his victory at the Battle of Talavera, in July 1809, Wellesley was made a peer and bestowed the titles baron and viscount. As he was unavailable, his elder brother William was consulted by the College of Heralds to decide on a suitable name for the title. William chose \\"Wellington\\", Viscount Wellington of Talavera, which became Wellesley's new name, one that he said was \\"exactly right\\".Holmes, p. 142.Hibbert, p. 91. On 26 August 1809, The London Gazette reported: \\"The King has been pleased to grant the Dignities of Baron and Viscount of the United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland unto the Right Honourable Sir Arthur Wellesley, Knight of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Lieutenant-General of His Majesty's Forces, and to the Heirs Male of his Body lawfully begotten, by the Names, Styles, and Titles of Baron Douro of Wellesley, in the County of Somerset, and Viscount Wellington of Talavera, and of Wellington, in the said County.\\" He returned to Europe in 1815 appointed overall commander of the Anglo-Allied forces of the Seventh Coalition, better known as the Hundred Days, following Napoleon's escape from exile and attempt to retain power.Holmes, pp. 208‚Äì210. Despite many battles to his name over twenty-one years of duty, it would be shortly after the battle at Waterloo upon hearing of approximately 50,000 casualties dead or dying that he wept, saying \\"I hope to God I have fought my last battle.\\" It had been a close victory at such great cost that it broke his fighting spirit, and marked the end of his long service overseas with a notable military career.Holmes, p. 254. He returned to British politics and became a leading statesman.Holmes, pp. 270‚Äì292. He was appointed Master- General of the Ordnance (1819‚Äì27)Holmes, pp. 157‚Äì158. and Commander-in-Chief of the Forces (1827‚Äì28/1842‚Äì52),Holmes, pp. 268‚Äì269, 291. but Wellington did not fight again. Generalship Sir Thomas Lawrence, 1815 Wellesley's understanding of logistics was to prove valuable in leading an expeditionary force against the French invasion of Portugal and Spain.Holmes, p. 88. He was adept at planning long marches through unknown territory, understanding that he not only had thousands of men to manage efficiently, but that a huge amount of supplies were required to adequately feed and sustain his army. Secure supply lines to the Portuguese coast were of vital importance if he was to maintain his ability to fight the French.Rothenberg, p. 136. In April 1809, Wellesley returned to Portugal with 28,000 British and 16,000 Portuguese troops under his command ‚Äì the French Army of Spain numbered 360,000.Rothenberg, p. 139. Despite many French troops having been dispersed to garrisons across Spain or located to protect supply and communication lines, even with the Portuguese Army and militia, and remnants of the Spanish Army and guerrillas to support him, Wellington faced overwhelming odds. Before its retreat at Corunna in January 1809, the number of British soldiers in the Peninsula did not exceed 40,000 men under Lieutenant-General Moore, though Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese army increased to around 72,000 infantry and cavalry under his command at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813.Gates, pp. 519‚Äì520. The King's German Legion (KGL) and the British-trained Portuguese Army were also under his command throughout the Peninsular War. Many British politicians were opposed to the war in Europe and favoured withdrawal,Rothenberg, pp. 141‚Äì142. which hampered its will to muster a larger force to defeat Napoleon. This served in sharpening Wellington's awareness that a defensive strategy was essential, initially, to ensure the British Army survived. At Waterloo, of his roughly 73,000 strong army, around 26,000 (36 percent) were British,Adkin, p. 37. though this relatively low number was due to the majority of his Peninsular veterans being shipped elsewhere after Napoleon's first abdication, many being sent to North America to serve in the final months of the War of 1812 against the United States. Wellington faced armies formed from the disbanded French Grande Arm√©e, once an overpowering force, which having conquered Europe and expanded the French Empire had been led by Napoleon and his marshals since 1804.Rothenberg, pp. 70‚Äì74. It had been reformed into multiple smaller and more mobile armies from October 1808. In the Peninsula the French were grouped into multiple armies, each operating chiefly in its own area, in order to secure Portugal and Spain.Barnett, pp. 148‚Äì149. These forces were commanded by French marshals, senior generals chosen for elevation by Napoleon himself. Though these armies were under the nomiminal command of Napoleon's brother, King Joseph Bonaparte, the marshals commanded their armies with a high degree of independence. Wellington arrived in Lisbon in 1809 with an army composed mostly of volunteers.Fletcher (2005), p. 15.Longford, pp. 312‚Äì322. British troops were better trained than their French counterparts and were required to repeatedly practice firing with live rounds before encountering combat.Holmes, p. 48. Napoleon only personally campaigned in Spain once, between October 1808 and January 1809,Barnett, pp. 148‚Äì150. taking most of his Guard and many √©lite troops with him when he left. After the disastrous failure of the invasion of Russia, Napoleon weakened his forces in Spain in early 1813 by redeploying many veteran troops from the Peninsula to Germany to shore up his losses. Subsequently, many of the remaining troops became a second line in quality, experience and equipment ‚Äì some new recruits were often not French.Griffith, pp. 43‚Äì44. Wellington's army consisted of four combat arms: Infantry, cavalry and artillery. Engineers also played a valuable role in the Peninsula, such as the building of the Lines of Torres Vedras ‚Äì a defensive line of forts built to protect LisbonRothenberg, pp. 140‚Äì143. ‚Äì and making preparations for any sieges throughout the war.Napier (1835‚Äì40), vol. XII, pp. 159‚Äì160. Wellington's main combat arm was his well-trained infantry. He never had more than 2,000 cavalry before 1812,Rothenberg, p. 137. and his cannons, although highly competent, were inferior to French guns in both number and quality. It was with this force that Wellington aimed to defend Portugal until he took to an offensive strategy in 1812, beating the French at the Battle of Salamanca. He advanced on to Madrid, arriving on 12 August 1812 ‚Äì Joseph Bonaparte had abandoned the capital after the defeat at Salamanca.Rothenberg, pp. 141‚Äì147. Carlo Marochetti's statue of the Duke of Wellington, Glasgow The Spanish government made Wellington commander-in- chief of all allied armies, providing an extra 21,000 Spanish troops after Salamanca. Although not completely undefeated he never lost a major battle.Holmes, p. xv. His greatest defeat came at the Siege of Burgos in 1812, where he had hoped to prevent French forces concentrating.Fletcher (2003), p. 4. After losing 2,000 men and causing only 600 French casualties he was forced to raise the siege and retreat, calling it \\"the worst scrape I was ever in.\\"Holmes, pp. 170‚Äì171. Retiring to winter quarters, where he received reinforcements that brought his regular army up to 75,000 men, Wellington began his final offensive in June 1813. He advanced north, through the Pyrenees, and into France itself. The French were no longer fighting to keep Spain but to defend their own border. Ultimately, between the battles of Roli√ßa (August 1808) and Toulouse (April 1814), the war against the French lasted for six years, with Wellington finally managing to drive the French from the Iberian Peninsula.Rothenberg, p. 151. Shortly thereafter, on 12 April 1814, word reached Wellington that Napoleon had abdicated on 6 April.Fletcher (2005), p. 106. The war on the Peninsula was over. Wellington and his army had marched over an estimated Fletcher (2005), p. 107. and fought in many engagements through Portugal and Spain, the consequences of which helped bring the downfall of Napoleon, resulting in peace across Europe. Battle record There are a large number of battles attributed to Wellington. Although many leave the impression that he was present or in command at those actions, it was sometimes the case that he entrusted other officers to engage the enemy, such as at remote locations, and that he could not have attended them all in person. Similarly, Wellington was not usually in command of rear guard actions, during advances or retreats, despite his army engaging in them often. Engagements where the lack of his presence is absolutely certain, or where his position is unconfirmed by records and accounts, are not included in his battle record. ;Key to opponent flags { width=\\"120\\" valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\"French First Republic(1792‚Äì1804) width=\\"130\\" valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\"First French Empire(1804‚Äì1814; 1815) width=\\"130\\" valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\"Kingdom of Mysore width=\\"130\\" valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\"Maratha Empire width=\\"80\\" valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\"Denmark } ;Key to outcome * Indicates a decisive victory {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:1em auto 1em auto\\" !width=\\"110\\"Date !width=\\"140\\"Conflict !width=\\"auto\\"Action !width=\\"70\\"Opponent !width=\\"45\\"Type !width=\\"100\\"Country !width=\\"100\\"RankRoberts, pp. xvi‚Äìxxvii.

Meuser's style was versatile and his works prolific. In his lifetime he worked as an illustrator, portrait painter and cartoonist for several newspaper editorial pages. Biography He married Dorothy Ellen Morris in 1938. Their only child, Jacqueline Ellen Meuser, married Suren Saroyan, MD, cousin of the famous American Playwright William Saroyan. \\"I've led a most full life,\\" he said to his wife just before his death. Besides teaching at the Art School of San Francisco, he had been a baseball pitcher, a vaudeville performer, a sailor working around the world twice, and \\"was more than a fair boxer.\\" He had worn 14 different law enforcement badges. At 31, he was the youngest chief of police in Marin County, California. As a member of the Sheet Metal Workers International, he worked at the Terminal Island Naval Shipyard. There he was awarded the Navy's \\"Certificate of Award\\" for a suggestion that was adopted concerning the building of naval ships. He also wrote a column in the union's newspaper. Career Meuser painted many of the 20th century prominent personalities, including Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Harry S. Truman, Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy. His portrait of Roosevelt hung in the White House and he received a personal letter of thanks from the late president. While at the shipyard, he was commissioned to paint the portraits of Rear Admiral and Mrs. Paul Hendren, USN and Rear Admiral T. P. Wynkoop USN. He drew two sketches of General Douglas MacArthur in 1950; each accompanying editorials in the Long Beach Press Telegram. The latter sketch prompted an oil painting commissioned by a prominent businessman in the San Francisco Bay Area. Shortly after his death, the original sketch of General MacArthur was donated to Fort MacArthur, San Pedro CA by his wife in 1964. In addition to his oil, water and casein paint colors, he also did many editorial cartoon sketches for newspapers. Later work Abstract nude painting, 1956 By 1949, Meuser had devoted his life to painting full-time. Around 1950 he became interested in abstraction. Previously, his subjects were depicted in realistic terms. He wrote about his painting Mare Nostrum, \\"It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples.\\" The vast majority of his artwork was painted between 1949 and 1957. The variety and quality of his work, as well as the quantity, during this period was significant. As President of the San Pedro Art Association in 1953, he oversaw three galleries and designed, renovated and constructed plans for the group's first permanent gallery. In 1955 he was elected a member of the nationwide California Water Color Society (currently known as the National Watercolor Society), where he was close friends with past presidents Arnold Franz Brasz and Leonard Edmondson. He participated and won awards in scores of art exhibitions across the country. His award winning painting Occultation went on tour in the traveling section of the California Water Color Society's Annual Exhibition of 1962. His abstract work Northward was requested by the Long Beach Museum of Art in 1957 and remains in the museum's permanent collection as Abstract Expressionism. =Honors and recognition= * California Legislature, State Assembly Certificate of Recognition, July 7, 2011. * City of Los Angeles Certificate of Tribute, July 7, 2011. * County of Los Angeles Commendation, July 7, 2011. * Plaque Dedication by the San Pedro Art Association honoring Jay Meuser, mounted on an historical building in the heart of the San Pedro Art Walk, July 7, 2011. * Jay Meuser Memorial Award, presented by the National Watercolor Society for Abstract Art. =Purchase prizes= * San Pedro Art Patrons Purchase Award, 1953. * Top Recommendation for Purchase by Jury of Awards ‚Äî Long Beach Museum of Art, 1957. =Exhibitions= Abstract scene, c. 1955 * Los Angeles County Museum, Los Angeles, California * California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, California * Oakland Art Museum, Oakland, California * Virginia Museum of Fine Art, Richmond, Virginia * California State Fair, Sacramento, California * National Orange Show, San Bernardino, California * Pasadena Museum of Art, Pasadena, California * Denver Art Museum, Denver, Colorado * National Institute of Modern Art, Mexico City, Mexico * The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, Massachusetts * University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California * Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Santa Barbara, California * DeCordova Museum of Art, Lincoln Massachusetts * Santa Monica Art Gallery, Santa Monica, California * Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, California * Palos Verdes Library/Gallery, Palos Verdes Estates, California * Richmond Art Center, Richmond, California * Benjamin Franklin Library, Mexico City, Mexico * North American Cultural Institute, Mexico City, Mexico * Newport Harbor Annual, Newport Beach, California * San Francisco Museum of Art, San Francisco, California =Collections= * Marymount College, Palos Verdes, California * Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, California * Richard Dana Junior High School, San Pedro, California * Fort MacArthur, San Pedro, California * John F.

Legend A mendicant visited the house of Emon Sabur≈ç, richest man in Shikoku, seeking alms. Emon refused, broke the pilgrim's begging bowl, and chased him away. After his eight sons fell ill and died, Emon realized that K≈´kai was the affronted pilgrim and set out to seek his forgiveness. Having travelled round the island twenty times clockwise in vain, he undertook the route in reverse. Finally he collapsed exhausted and on his deathbed K≈´kai appeared to grant absolution. Emon requested that he be reborn into a wealthy family in Matsuyama so that he might restore a neglected temple. Dying, he clasped a stone. Shortly afterwards a baby was born with his hand grasped tightly around a stone inscribed \\"Emon Sabur≈ç is reborn.\\" When the baby grew up, he used his wealth to restore the or \\"stone-hand temple\\", in which there is an inscription of 1567 recounting the tale. Monuments Emon Saburo's grave is beside the path between Temple 11 and Temple 12, at the spot where he fell. Near Temple 46 there is a burial mound said to contain his eight sons. At Ishite-ji there is a casket containing the eponymous stone. Interpretation The legend supports a number of practices of the Shikoku pilgrimage: it encourages the custom of osettai or alms; suggests wealth should be spent endowing temples; gives an origin for the practice of reverse circuits of the island; and promises absolution for pilgrims.

(1660‚Äì1732) was an English clergyman, known as a Biblical commentator. Life He was the son of William Lowth, an apothecary, who was burnt out in the Great Fire of London, and was born in the parish of St Martin, Ludgate on 3 September 1660. He was educated by his grandfather, the Rev. Simon Lowth, rector of Tilehurst, Berkshire, and was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School on 11 September 1672. He was elected scholar of St John's College, Oxford, on 11 June 1675, and in due course became Fellow. He graduated B.A. in 1679, M.A. 1683, and B.D. 1688. Early work brought him to the notice of Peter Mews, Bishop of Winchester, who made him his chaplain, gave him a prebendal stall at Winchester on 8 October 1696, and presented him to the benefice of Buriton with Petersfield, Hampshire, in 1699, which he held until his death. He died at Buriton on 17 May 1732, and was buried there. Works His first published work was a ‚ÄòVindication of the Divine Authority of the Old and New Testaments,‚Äô London, 1692, a defence of the inspiration of holy scripture against the attacks of Jean Le Clerc. A second edition of the ‚ÄòVindication,‚Äô with a dissertation on the objections to the Pentateuch then current, was published in 1699. In 1708 he brought out ‚ÄòDirections for the profitable Study of Holy Scripture,‚Äô a shortwork which went through many editions. The work for which Lowth is best known is his ‚ÄòCommentary on the Prophets,‚Äô originally published in separate portions between 1714 and 1725, and afterwards collected in a folio volume as a continuation of Bishop Simon Patrick's ‚ÄòCommentary on the Earlier Books of the Old Testament;‚Äô it was frequently reprinted, together with the commentaries of Daniel Whitby, Richard Arnald, and Moses Lowman on the New Testament. Its tone is pious but cold; the exegesis is simple, direct, and brief. The commentary was praised by Bishop Richard Watson and by William Orme. The editions of Clemens Alexandrinus by John Potter, of Josephus by John Hudson, and of the early ecclesiastical historians by William Reading, were enriched with notes by Lowth, and other scholars received help from him. He was a correspondent of Edward Chandler during his controversy with Anthony Collins the deist. Family He married Margaret, daughter of Robert Pitt of Blandford, Dorset. They had two sons, of whom the younger, was Robert Lowth, and three daughters.

It originally aired on October 8, 2009. The episode was written by Sean Reycraft and Gabrielle Stanton and directed by Kevin Bray. Plot Damon (Ian Somerhalder) has been locked up at the basement for three days now, and Stefan (Paul Wesley) checks on him and tries to reeducate him. Stefan also took Damon's ring that protects him from going out to the sun and he warns Zach (Chris William Martin) to stay away from the basement. Elena (Nina Dobrev) surprisingly finds Vicki (Kayla Ewell) in the bathroom, she having spent the night with Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen). Later, Elena asks Jenna (Sara Canning) if she knows about it but Jenna says she is fine with it. Jenna asks about Stefan and Elena admits that she has not heard from him for three days. At school, Caroline (Candice Accola) organizes a wash car fundraiser and informs Elena and Bonnie (Kat Graham) about it. Stefan arrives and Caroline asks where Damon is. Stefan only tells her that he left and he will not be coming back. Later at the Mystic Grill, a stranger (Bob Banks) sees Stefan and is convinced that they have met before. He says that Stefan has not aged at all and even Stefan tells Elena that the stranger must be mistaking him for someone else, but she is not convinced. She asks about him but Stefan denies to answer, something that makes Elena upset with him, and she leaves without him. Stefan, to make up to Elena, prepares her favorite dinner, while at the same time sharing more of his story about Katherine and what his likes are. Elena tries to help him with the preparation but she cuts her finger. Stefan's face changes because of the blood smell and Elena catches a glimpse of his face as it reflects in the window. She tries to see if he is fine but Stefan manages to regain control before he faces her again. Vicki and Jeremy hang out in his room where she finds Elena's pain medicine from the car accident. Later, Vicki takes Jeremy to her favorite hangout, the cemetery. Her friends are there and when she passes them Elena's pills, which she took from the house without telling Jeremy, he gets mad, takes the pills back and leaves. At the car wash fundraiser, Bonnie is annoyed by Tiki's (Brandi Coleman) attitude and, without knowing how she did it, uses her powers to make the water hose explode in Tiki's face. When later Tiki puts her on sweeper duty, Bonnie ignites a stream of water and Tiki's car gets set on fire. Stefan manages to stop her before it is burned completely and Bonnie tells him not to tell anyone what happened. Bonnie later goes to her grandmother (Jasmine Guy) and tells her that she does not know what is happening to her. In the meantime, Elena sees the stranger again while she is tending the cash table and asks him about Stefan. The man tells her that he stayed at the Salvatore boarding house and met Stefan in 1953 and that Stefan's uncle was attacked by an animal back then. Elena approaches Logan (Chris Johnson) and asks him if she can use the station's news archives. Logan tells her that of course she can and also arranges a dinner with Jenna at her place, where his goal is to get the Gilbert watch. Elena goes through the archives to research the attack and finds a video report. She plays it and is stunned to see someone who looks just like Stefan standing in the background. She tries to understand how he cannot be aging and starts putting the pieces together. But she is not willing to believe what is in front of her, so she decides to ask Stefan straight about it and leaves to find him at his house. Meanwhile, Damon tries to compel Caroline from his cell so she can come and free him. Caroline starts seeing visions of Damon and hearing his voice. She ends up at the Salvatore house and opens the door to Damon's cell. Zach gets there and struggles to shut the door while telling Caroline to run. Unfortunately, Damon snaps Zach's neck and chases after Caroline but she manages to get out of the house before he reaches her since he cannot go out into the daylight without his ring. Back at the Gilbert house, Logan searches Jeremy's room and finds the watch. He takes it and on his way out runs into Jeremy. He tells him that he was looking for the bathroom so Jeremy will not suspect anything and manages to get out with the watch. Vicky and her friends are still at the cemetery. Vicki goes to the car to turn the music back on and sees a man leaning against the car. She asks if he is okay and gets close to him, but it turns out to be Damon, who attacks her. Stefan gets back home and finds Zach dead. He immediately retrieves a stake and runs to find Damon but the moment he opens the door Elena is standing there, frighteningly asking him: \\"What are you?\\" Feature music In \\"You're Undead to Me\\" we can hear the songs: *\\"Beauty of the Dark\\" by Mads Langer *\\"Don't Trust Me\\" by 3OH!3 *\\"Be There\\" by Howie Day *\\"When a Heart Breaks\\" by S.O.Stereo *\\"Wait It Out\\" by Imogen Heap *\\"Boom\\" by Anjulie *\\"Save the Lies\\" by Gabriella Cilmi *\\"This Year's Love\\" by David Gray Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"You're Dead to Me\\" was watched by 3.52 million; slightly down from the previous episode by only 0.01.

Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that the show has become a reason to stay home on Thursday nights. \\"It seems like we've reached a pretty big climax in the show: Damon has just asserted himself as a pretty evil villain, while Elena had that oh-so-important realization of every young vampire's love interest: The Epiphany.\\" Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews gave a mixed review to the episode rating it with 2.5/4 and stating: \\"This was one of those transition episodes, building up towards Stefan‚Äôs big reveal to Elena, building up to some resolution between Damon and Caroline, building up the Logan angle. It‚Äôs always hard to know what to say about these episodes.\\" Lucia from Heroine TV gave a good review saying that she loved the episode and can't wait for next week. \\"Previously, all hell broke loose, but that was nothing compared to this week. Damon escaped from his basement prison, Elena figured out that her boyfriend is a blood-sucking fiend, Bonnie almost killed people with her mind, Uncle Zach is dead, and Damon possibly killed Vicki. Also, there were several references to the Salvatore brothers‚Äô Italian heritage.\\" Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 2/4 saying that it was bland. \\"The fifth episode of the series is a necessary but not particularly interesting one. [...] There‚Äôs nothing glaringly wrong with the episode. There‚Äôs just nothing special, nothing outstanding, nothing to excite the viewer. The episode is strangely flat. It features both big and small story developments, but nothing comes off as momentous or engaging.\\" Book references *Stefan tells Elena that the Salvatore family crest on his ring dates to the Italian Renaissance.

Career Quickstep was built at Astoria and completed in 1877. The vessel ran on the lower Columbia River for some time. There were many owners and operators of Quickstep and the vessel was run on many different routes. In July 1883, Quickstep, under Capt. Thomas Doig, was brought north from the Columbia River to Puget Sound.Lewis and Dryden Marine History, at 252, 253, 307, 397. Apparently Quickstep had been returned to the Columbia River after that, as it is reported that about 1885, under Capt. George A. Whitcomb (1854‚Äì1939), a member of a prominent maritime family, the vessel was running between Astoria and Grays Harbor. Quickstep is reported to have been transferred to Puget Sound in 1887, or as early as 1885, by being purchased by Capt. J.J. Hansen (later to form Hansen Transportation Company, who had moved from Minnesota to Tacoma, and decided to enter the steamboat business, with Quickstep being his first vessel.McCurdy Marine History, at 20, 23, 49, 345, 477, and 528. For a short time in the early 1890s, Quickstep is reported to have been operated by Matthew McDowell for towing operations in the Tacoma area. There is also a report that Quickstep was sold by the Hansens in 1893 so they could replace it with a newer vessel, the Hattie Hansen. In 1894, Capt. Charles F. Kraft (b. 1831) bought Quickstep and brought the vessel to Lake Washington. In 1896, Capt. John L. Anderson bought Quickstep for $1,600 as a replacement for his steamer Winnifred, which had burned in early 1896. Loss by fire On 3 January, 1897 Quickstep in turn was lost by fire.

The two taller stones represent parenthood while the smaller one represents a child. Even though there is considerable demand for family planning in Pakistan, the adoption of family planning has been hampered by government neglect, lack of services and misconceptions. Demographics play a large role in Pakistan's development and security since the recent change from military rule to civilian leadership. Challenges to Pakistani's well-being, opportunities for education and employment, and access to health care are escalated due to the country's continuously-growing population. It was estimated in 2005 that Pakistan's population totaled 151 million; a number which grows 1.9 percent annually, equaling a 2.9 million population growth per year.\\"Pakistan: Debating Islam and family planning.\\" IRIN. UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 06 Apr 2011. http://irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=28617 Though Pakistan's fertility rates still exceed those of neighboring South Asian countries with a total fertility rate at 4.1 (3.3 children in urban settings and 4.5 children in rural areas) and contraception use is lower than 35 percent, approximately one-fourth of Pakistani women wish to either delay the birth of their next child or end childbearing altogether. According to Dr. Ansar Ali Khan, an advisor of reproductive health to the United Nations Population Fund in Pakistan, \\"A combination of factors like non-availability of services, baseless traditional beliefs and misconception play a big role.\\" In addition, Ali Khan stated that \\"a fairly large number of the population believes the use of artificial contraceptives for family planning is against nature and also against Islam.\\" Unlike family planning in Iran, a neighboring Islamic republic, Pakistan's family planning program has failed in recent years due to neglect and constant policy changes as a result of political upheaval.Boonstra, Healther. \\"Islam, Women and Family Planning: A Primer.\\" The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy. Volume 4, Number 6, 4-7. December 2001. While 96 percent of married women were reported to know about at least one method of contraception, only half of them had ever used it. History In 1950, Pakistan's population reached 37 million people, making it the world's 13th most populous country. Though Pakistan was one of the first Asian countries to begin a family planning program with some help from international donors, fertility has declined slower than in neighboring countries. In 2007, Pakistan had increased in world population ranking to 6th, with over 164 million people and the United Nations (UN) has projected that in 2050 it will move into 5th place with around 292 million people. Beginnings The Family Planning Association of Pakistan (FPAP), now called \\"Rahnuma\\", was founded in Lahore by Saeeda Waheed in 1953.http://www.fpapak.org/ Waheed, a member of the All-Pakistan Women's Association, began advocating for birth control when her maid died from an attempt to abort her own pregnancy.Khan, Ayesha. \\"Policy-making in Pakistan's population programme.\\" Health and Policy Planning. Volume 11, Number 1, 30-51. Oxford, 1996. The FPAP was unsuccessful in changing family planning policies until President and military leader Ayub Khan took interest in the problem of overpopulation in the late 1950s. Khan spoke at the FPAP's first national seminar in 1959, speaking on the ‚Äòmenace over overpopulation'. Soon after the seminar, the National Board of Family Planning was established as a policy-advising body for the federal government. Pakistani journalist/researcher Ayesha Khan has suggested various reasons for Ayub Khan's position on population control. Firstly, religion played a minor role in his government, a position that would change with Pakistan's next leader. Secondly, development ideology during Khan's time of power warned of the economic risks of high population growth rates. Thirdly, it had political utility for a military leader with no popular mandate to his leadership and in need of a development strategy. Lastly, support from international donors. Family planning policy in the 1960s Pakistan's first Family Planning Scheme was a part of the country's Third Five Year Plan (1965‚Äì1970). This scheme became the template for all subsequent family planning strategies. The scheme's goal was to have a vast impact in the shortest time possible, with a reduction of the birth rate from 50 to 40 per 1000 by 1970. At the onset of the program, condoms were the most available method of contraception, but by 1966 the Intrauterine Device (IUD) had replaced it has the \\"corner-stone\\" of the Scheme. It was said to be \\"safe, cheap, reversible,\\" and it required \\"little user action.\\" Family planning amid political turmoil In 1969, Ayub Khan was overthrown by the joint action of Islamist parties and the leftist Pakistan People's Party. His successor Yahya Khan did little more than watch as a civil war ripped apart East and West Pakistan in 1971. Wajihuddin Ahmed, the Family Planning Commissioner during Yahya Khan's rule, focused on reducing pregnancies in women \\"rather than meeting contraceptive targets alone\\" and introducing the pill to Pakistani women. In 1971, while the country was split apart and international assistance halted due to army atrocities in Bangladesh, the Pakistan Peoples Party took power of the Pakistani government. Its leader, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, needed to gain legitimacy and popularity by taking an anti-American, anti-capitalist, and anti-Ayub Khan-stance. However, Bhutto found that he could not fund many of his socialist promises, and so allowed economic assistance from USAID. Over the 15-year span of 1964-1979, USAID \\"spent over $30 million on Pakistan's population programme; during 1965‚Äì75 US AID provided 40% of total programme inputs.\\" However, due to extreme and unrealistic goals, the USAID program was highly ineffective. In 1977 Bhutto's Chief of Army Staff, General Zia ul-Haq, deposed the leader and declared martial law. Zia differed from his predecessors in that he \\"made the religious-right-wing his political ideology.\\" He had used the religious lobbies and conservative middle-classes as support for his take-over. In a move looking to counter Bhutto's government and as a gesture to his religious constituency, Zia froze the existing family planning program and banned publicity for family planning activities. Zia enforced strict laws against adultery (punishable by death), rape, intoxication, and theft. USAID funding was suspended, and Pakistan became alienated \\"from the Western powers that Ayub Khan had so carefully cultivated.\\" Near the end of Zia's era of power, family planning and population control became tied to the Ministry of Health (Pakistan). Unfortunately, the program has remained fairly unchanged over the past 35 years due to implementation problems involving over-centralization, lack of coordination, and structural flaws. Rural and Urban Healthcare Disparities That Contribute to Pakistan‚Äôs High Child Mortality Rate One of Pakistan's largest problems is its rapidly expanding population and their limited access to necessary essentials such as readily available healthcare, doctor's, and basic sexual education.https://data.unicef.org/wp- content/uploads/country_profiles/Pakistan/country%20profile_PAK.pdf Although the nation has recently been making active efforts to adhere to the United Nations Millennium Development Goalshttps://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-infant- mortality/1859052.html that aims to reduce global infant mortality by two- thirds, their efforts have fallen short as a large population of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan resides in rural areas where the nation's efforts have rarely been seen. The accompanying concerns of this crisis have resulted in extremely high neonatal, infant and child mortality rates. According to the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, Pakistan's rates of child mortality (neonatal mortality rate: 44.2; infant mortality rate: 61.2; child under 5 mortality rate: 74.9)https://childmortality.org/data nearly double the worldwide average (neonatal mortality rate: 18; infant mortality rate: 29.4; child under 5 mortality rate: 39.1)https://data.unicef.org/topic/child- survival/under-five-mortality/ set by UNICEF Global. Religious influences Muslim populations are incredibly diverse, varying by race, language, and degree of religious conservatism.Roudi-Fahimi, Farzeaneh. \\"Islam and Family Planning.\\" Population Reference Bureau. 2004. Some populations are part of countries run by Islamic law, while others live under secular governments. In Pakistan, extremely conservative Islamic beliefs predominate in many parts of the country, in which purdah restricts women to their homes unless chaperoned by a male relative. Additionally, levels of schooling are very low in Pakistan, allowing men to have more power in decision-making. When Ayub Khan was overthrown in 1969, religious demonstrators attempted to discredit the leader morally using the slogan \\"Family planning, for those who want free sex!\\" This ideology is still present in Pakistan, as the organized religious party opposes family planning because it is \\"un-Islamic\\". Though Pakistani couples commonly cite religious reasons for avoiding birth control, there is not one definitive agreement about family planning and contraception in Islam. In Pakistan, many local religious figures are supportive of family planning and have begun discussions in their communities in order to promote the health of women and children. Although many public health specialists feel that religion plays a major role in resistance to the use of FP in Pakistan, the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey of 2006-7 showed that religious reasons accounted for only 9% of FP non-use. In fact, many NGOs have implemented interventions where they have worked with local or national clergy. Islamabad based think tank Research and Development Solutions reports that there is no quantitative evidence that any of these interventions have resulted in an increase in CPR in these communities. Current contraceptive use Historically, political strife and cultural restrictions on women constraining their empowerment have hampered implementation of family planning strategies throughout the country. Most women who say they do not want any more children or would like to wait a period of time before their next pregnancy do not have the contraceptive resources available to them in order to do so. One-fourth of married women are estimated to have an unmet need. In the 1990s, women increasingly reported to wanting fewer children, and 24 percent of recent births were reported to be unwanted or mistimed. The rate of unwanted pregnancies is higher for women living in poor or rural environments; this is especially important since two-thirds of women live in rural areas. While only 22 percent of pregnant married women report being currently using a modern method of birth control and 8 percent reported to be using a traditional method, lack of widespread contraceptive use could be due to the lack breadth of the current family planning program. The most commonly reported reasons for married women electing not to use family planning methods include the belief that fertility should be determined by God (28 percent); opposition to use by the woman, her husband, others or a perceived religious prohibition (23 percent); infertility (15 percent); and concerns about health, side effects or the cost of family planning (12 percent). The first abortion penal code (Article 312) of this region dates back to 1860, during British colonial rule which stipulated that unless an abortion was to \\"save a woman's life,\\" it was expressly illegal and punishable by law, and the same applied for (self)induced miscarriages.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/pakistan.doc In 1990, the penal code was provisionally adapted in order to better reflect Islamic Law, and finally was made permanent in 1997. According to this change in the abortion law, preservation of \\"the physical and mental health\\" of a woman, early on in the pregnancy, also became legal grounds for a permissible abortion.http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.htmlhttps://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2007_Abortion_Policies_Chart/2007_WallChart.pdf Unfortunately, however the interpretation of necessary treatment required by a woman for an abortion to be performed is vague, and despite the legality, health professionals in Pakistan felt abortion was \\"immoral, contrary to religion and illegal,\\" especially according to female paramedics when compared to doctors and gynaecologists.http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2013RH_PakistanPAC.pdf However, the female paramedics had a more lenient attitude when it came to a question of whether an abortion was justified: to save a mother's life, when the fetus was either abnormal or when a woman was raped; whereas the gynaecologists and doctors felt it was less permissible to perform, especially in the case of rapes. Unfortunately, health care professionals do not wish to perform abortions either due to their own religious leanings, ethical stances or fear of stigmatization.http://jpma.org.pk/full_article_text.php?article_id=224http://www.dawn.com/news/976212/karachi- doctors-attitudes-responsible-for-unsafe-abortions When a comparison of the private sector and public sector was made with regards to abortion and post- abortion care provided, it was noted that the private sector performed more abortions and took on double the case-load of post-abortion care, as opposed to the public sector. Therefore, it currently plays an important role in the provision of care of patients undergoing abortions. Due to a lack of access (especially in the rural areas), no clarity (dearth of awareness, understanding and education), fear of legal persecution (especially in the public sector), an inability of health care professionals to interpret the law, as well as a form of FP, women are often forced to seek abortion by untrained providers. According to an indirect estimation method, applied to the 2002 national data on abortions and its related complications in Pakistan, 1 in every 7 pregnancy terminates in an abortion. Extending beyond the reach of family planning and contraceptive methods is the issue of women's sexual and reproductive health. According to the World Health Organization and Population Action International, as of 2007, \\"only 16 percent of women receive at least four antenatal care visits during pregnancy, fewer than one-third of births are attended by skilled health personnel, and the maternal mortality ratio, at 320 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, remains high.\\" Current policy Dating from 2002, Pakistan's current family planning policy reflects the government's concern with rising population trends and poverty. The policy's goals include reducing population growth (from 2.1 percent in 2002 to 1.3 by 2020), reducing fertility through voluntary family planning (from 4 births per woman in 2004 to 2.1 births per woman by 2020), and as a signatory to the Programme of Action developed at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994, Pakistan pledged to provide universal access to family planning by 2010. Also in Pakistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is the objective of increasing contraceptive use 57 percent by 2012. At present there is no federal ministry of health or population welfare and therefore no population policy. However, at the time of writing, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab are working on individual Health and Population strategies. An analysis of this policy showed that while the Government of Pakistan spent US$652 million funds under this policy between 2000 and 2009 (UNFPA), there was hardly any change in CPR which was 30% in 2000 and remained unchanged in 2006. It is also important to note that other elements of population development such as education, capacity building, economic development, climate etc. were notably absent from this policy.Khan and Khan et al. Family Planning in Pakistan: Applying What We Have Learned. JPMA April 2013 In 2009 the Ministry of Population sought to revise the Population Policy. However, under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, the Ministry was devolved and its responsibilities were shifted to Provincial Population Welfare Departments. In 2013 some of the provinces - notably Punjab - reported that they were developing their own population policies. Family planning in 2000s In 2006‚Äì07, the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey of Pakistan (PDHS 2006-7) showed that approximately 30% of married women of reproductive age (MWRA) were using some form of Family Planning. Of these 8% used a traditional and 22% used a modern method. Approximately 25% had an unmet for Family Planning, of this around 2/3rd was for limiting and the rest for spacing. These translate into 7 million FP users, 5 million users of modern methods and 6 million with an unmet need. Since a large number of modern method users are sterilized and received the service in a previous year, the actual number women availing any FP service were just under 3 million or less than half of those with an unmet need.Research and Development Solutions Policy Brief Series #1: Overview of Family Planning in Pakistan The DHS also dispelled the popular notion that religious reasons keep families from using family planning. In the DHS less than 10% of FP nonusers cited a religious reason for their non-use. Using data from the PDHS 2006-7, approximately 35% of FP users received their FP services from the public sector, 12% from NGOs and private providers and the overwhelming 52% bought their methods over the counter from shops, making FP services largely subject to market forces. The government spends on average around Rs. 4 billion (US$42 million) a year on FP but nearly 90% of this goes towards salaries and overheads and commodities account for 7-14% of these funds.Research and Development Solutions Policy Brief Series #4: Utilization and Costs of Family Planning in PakistanNational Health Accounts of Pakistan 2005-6 Since the PDHS 2006-7, operations of NGOs have increased but it appears that according to the supply data there has been no increase in supply of FP commoditiesResearch and Development Solutions Policy Brief Series #13: Services and Uptake and Trends over time and that entry of the NGO Marie Stopes Society into FP services has displaced clients from other private sector, perhaps those that previously self procured commodities. Additionally, it appears that the if the amount of commodities that are being reported by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics in its \\"Annual Contraceptive Prevalence Reports\\" is accurate, the overall increase in population may mean that the CPR for modern methods may have actually declined. Even when one adjusts for underreporting for private sector and NGO services, it is likely that the current CPR may actually be unchanged from the PDHS 2006-7. A more accurate picture will emerge with the release of the data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2012. Family planning after 2010 A brief version of the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2012 was released in October 2013. It showed that the overall CPR had climbed to 33.4% of which approximately 25% was from modern methods. In essence it showed that the overall increase in CPR since the previous DHS had been around 1% per annum overall and around 0.5% in modern methods. Extrapolating these results to estimated populations suggest that there are 8.8 million users of any FP, 5.5 million users of modern methods and 3.65 million women who avail FP services in any given year. Thus only around 14% of all married women of reproductive age (MWRA) access FP services in a given year. This represents an increase of 700,000 users since the last DHS; around 2/3 of this difference may be attributed to increased population and nearly all these were supplied by NGOs.Research and Development Solutions Policy Brief Series #43. Changes in CPR between Pakistan DHS 2006 and 2012. The preliminary DHS report does not report sources of FP services but analysis of government's contraceptive prevalence report suggests that 44% avail public sector services and that the role of NGOs has increased from 11% in 2006-7 to around 40%. The total change in users of FP services between 2006 and 2012 was around 700,000 women. This is exactly equal to the increase in number of women served by NGOs (supported by donors such as USAID, DFID, KfW, GIZ, David and Lucile Packard Foundation etc.); while the overall quantum services by the Government and those that self procure commodities from stores remained the same. Community Health Workers In the 1990s, two agencies in Pakistan started village-based community health worker programs in Pakistan. The Ministry of Population Welfare started planning a program in 1992 based on a similar program in Bangladesh. This program recruited married women, with at least 10 years of schooling, that lived in rural areas, and trained them to provide family planning services to their communities. The aim of these services was to reduce the fertility rate and slow population growth. The Ministry of Health (Pakistan) started a similar program in 1994 called \\"lady health workers.\\" This program emphasized maternal and child health, and also delivered family planning services. Both groups of women provide door to door health and family planning services, supplied with oral and injectable contraceptives and condoms to distribute to their communities. One study in 2002 showed that in areas with 2 or more community-based workers there was a 7% increase in the use of modern, reversible contraceptive methods. An evaluation of the lady health worker program showed only a marginal improvement in FP among health indicators the populations served of around 5-6%.Research and Development Solutions Policy Brief Series #15: The Role of Lady Health Workers in Family Planning in Pakistan.

Silverman previously served as president of American Atheists, a non-profit organization supporting the rights of atheists and the removal of expressions of religion in government, from 2010 to 2018. His annual anti-Christmas billboard which calls Christmas \\"a myth\\" has often sparked controversy. Silverman is also the subject of the popular Are You Serious (face)? internet meme. Silverman identifies as a firebrand atheist and defines firebrand atheism as vocally \\"attacking\\" humans' \\"silly\\" religious beliefs without attacking the individuals themselves.The Case Against In-Your-Face Atheism by Steve Neumann, The Daily Beast, 4/14/17 Early life Silverman was born in a middle-class Reform Jewish family in Marblehead, Massachusetts. He went to Hebrew school and was bar mitzvahed when he was 13 years old. Silverman began publicly challenging religion in high school and often states in interviews that he became an atheist at the age of six. Although he was never in the closet about his disbelief, he was forced to do his Bar mitzvah. He calls this the turning point in his life where he decided never to lie about his atheism again because he had gotten up on stage and told all the people he knew that he believed in God. Seventeen years later his father admitted to him that he also was an atheist. Career and activism Silverman speaking at the 2017 International Conference on Free Expression and Conscience in London. Silverman received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University and MBA in Marketing from Penn State University, and an Advanced Graduate Certificate in International Business from Seton Hall. Silverman is a former professional inventor with 74 patents, and has authored several articles, including a cover story for Inventors Digest. Silverman rejects the label of being \\"Jewish\\" and in a speech in Phoenix titled \\"I'm an Atheist and So Are You\\", he urged secular Jewish audience to follow his lead and abandon the term \\"Jew\\". David Silverman has argued that Judaism is neither a culture, a race or a nationality. American Atheists and Atheist Alliance International Silverman worked with the American Atheists organization since 1996, and holding a variety of roles, including: New Jersey State Director, Communications Director, and Vice President. He was elected president of American Atheists on September 16, 2010, following Ed Buckner. During his tenure as Communications Director and Vice President of American Atheists, Silverman made several media appearances, but became especially visible since becoming president. An atheist awareness billboard campaign launched in December 2010 sparked controversy and increased media exposure for the organization. As a result of this campaign, Silverman appeared on a number of television shows since late 2010, most notably, The O'Reilly Factor on January 4, 2011. It was under Silverman's direction that the American Atheists group sought to block the preservation of a cross-beam section of the World Trade Center skeleton that resembled a cross. Silverman opined:ATHEISTS FILE SUIT TO BLOCK WTC MEMORIAL CROSS, A press release of July 25, 2011 from the American Atheists website, as reflected from the Internet Archive, retrieved August 24, 2018 \\"The WTC cross has become a Christian icon. It has been blessed by so-called holy men and presented as a reminder that their God, who couldn't be bothered to stop the... terrorists or prevent 3,000 people from being killed in his name, cared only enough to bestow upon us some rubble that resembles a cross...\\" Controversy On April 13, 2018, Silverman was terminated as president of American Atheists over complaints of financial and sexual misconduct. Silverman had been placed on paid leave on April 10 pending an investigation into a complaint received on April 7. The day after his termination, BuzzFeed News published an article detailing allegations of unwanted sexual contact by two women, subsequently denied by Silverman.Leading atheist, accused of sexual misconduct, speaks out, Washington Post (republished article from Religion News Service) by Kimberly Winston, September 6, 2018 The new president of American Atheists, Nick Fish, specified that Silverman's termination was not over sexual allegations, but as a result of a \\"loss of confidence\\" stemming from violations of internal policies on staff management, conflicts of interest, and their general code of conduct. Silverman was appointed Executive Director of Atheist Alliance International (AAI) in October 2019. He resigned from his position in December 2019. AAI President Gail Miller recognized Silverman \\"for the contribution he had made in reorganizing the AAI board and its operations\\". Media appearances Silverman attended and spoke at the 2011 American Atheists National Convention, in Des Moines, Iowa During his speech, he announced plans for the Reason Rally. On March 24, 2012 the Reason Rally took place at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and was the largest atheist gathering in world history. Silverman was the Creator and Executive Producer of the event, and the President of the Reason Rally Coalition, the coalition he founded to run the rally. On October 28, 2011, Silverman and Dinesh D'Souza participated in a public debate on whether Christianity is beneficial for America. Silverman went on Fox News's Hannity to discuss Christmas-themed billboards that American Atheists put up in Times Square, New York City. He also gave a talk to the Secular Humanist Jewish Circle in Tucson, Arizona detailing the incorrectness of Jewish atheism and how religion lies in general to promote itself. Silverman's first book, Fighting God: An Atheist Manifesto for a Religious World, was released on December 1, 2015. Anti-Christmas billboards  Silverman has spearheaded the controversial anti-Christmas campaign by placing strategically placed billboards from New York City to San Francisco featuring unapologetic slogans like \\"Keep the Merry, Dump the Myth!\\", \\"You Know It's a Myth. This Season, Celebrate Reason\\" and \\"Dear Santa all I want for Christmas is to skip church!\\" The anti-Christmas billboards and subsequent TV appearances are often followed by a growth in subscribers and donations. Silverman has also launched antireligion billboard campaigns in the Bible Belt, urging people to skip church. Personal life David Silverman has one child who attended I.L. Peretz Secular Jewish school.

MPC is known to have stood up for the struggle to finally resolve the age-old armed conflict in Mindanao through a negotiated political settlement that contains the essentials acceptable to both negotiating parties and that addresses the historical oppression and forced marginalization of the native inhabitants and indigenous peoples of this island. As such, MPC is actively working for the strengthening of the participation and engagement of tripeoples grassroots constituency in the Mindanao peace process so as to allow their recognition as self-determining peoples who can develop and govern themselves in the economic, political, social and spiritual spheres of development. Since its establishment in 2001, MPC has made various breakthroughs in the peacebuilding arena which facilitated significant gains in the peace process. One of which is the formation of its independent ceasefire mechanism known as the ‚ÄúBantay Ceasefire‚Äù which gained recognition and respect among the formal ceasefire mechanisms of both the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Bantay Ceasefire is composed of more than 600 volunteers, from Basilan, Lanao provinces, Cotabato, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, Compostela Valley and Sulu, who are actively monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Given the serious humanitarian crisis that befell Mindanao, MPC has enhanced its work from ceasefire monitoring to humanitarian protection, dubbed as ‚ÄúSagip Sibilyan‚Äù, in order to extend direct humanitarian assistance, from advocacy to capacity building interventions, to thousands of innocent civilians who became forced and direct victims of internal displacement, human rights abuses and military repression. Since the outbreak of the war in August 2008, the Mindanao Peoples Caucus has been leading the campaign for a ceasefire amidst a highly polarized situation where Christian vigilante groups like the Ilaga (Rat) were pitted against Bangsamoro communities. It has been a total shock among the Bantay Ceasefire volunteers who too were threatened because of their open support to the peace process. Despite constant threats and intimidation and with the hawks gaining the upper hand within the government, the MPC did now step back in its peace advocacy. Seeing the collapse of the ceasefire which Bantay Ceasefire members had painstakingly preserved through vigilance and monitoring work ‚Äì MPC had to address a serious demoralization problem among its members some of them were even afraid of wearing their uniform vests. August 2008 and the ensuing backlash in the peace talks leading to an open outbreak of armed hostilities and a massive humanitarian crisis had put to serious challenge MPC‚Äôs commitment to peacebuilding and peace advocacy. The August 18 attack by the MILF in Kauswagan and Kolambogan had created such a highly emotional public outrage that even known civil society organizations and peace advocates within these areas at that time could not openly call for a ceasefire as it is misconstrued to be siding with the MILF. The mindset at that time was to avenge the death of innocent victims, have the civilians take up arms and fight to the end.  Ceasefire Campaign  One of the major accomplishments of MPC during this dark period of the peace process is its leading role in the national campaign for a ceasefire in Mindanao which galvanized massive support from church, academe, business and the war-affected communities themselves. While this achievement is of course attributable to so many interlocking efforts, MPC has been in the forefront of the campaigns from the grassroots to the halls of Malacanang in order to appeal for a ceasefire and bring national attention to the humanitarian crisis in Central Mindanao. After 17 months of open armed hostilities which displaced over 600,000 people, Mindanao has finally reverted to a ceasefire, with the International Monitoring Team back in Mindanao. In November 2009, the Bantay Ceasefire Assembly was convened in Marawi City. The assembly succeeded in launching the new thrust of Bantay Ceasefire which is on Humanitarian Protection. Dubbed as ‚ÄúSagip Sibilyan‚Äù, Bantay Ceasefire‚Äôs work will now focus in alleviating the suffering of the civilians who are caught in the conflict through a programmatic humanitarian protection work. This will cover work on early warning, disaster response and promotion of human rights. This will also include providing legal services or referral of cases involving violations of human rights and war crimes in order to break the impunity for these abuses. This will not however mean that BC will no longer conduct its regular monitoring of the ceasefire agreement. There are clearly good lessons that can be drawn from the MOA-AD experience which can shed light on how to move forward. The key here is that civil society and peace advocates recognize, accept and learn from those lessons. One lesson that MPC offers is that peace education and peacebuilding efforts fell short in educating our communities, schools, families and the public at large on the root causes of the armed conflict in Mindanao which include the legitimate claim of the Bangsamoro and indigenous peoples to their ancestral domain. The peace movement in general, and that includes MPC, has failed to raise the awareness of ordinary Mindanaoans on the historical background of the conflict and why we should all work for the finding of a just and mutually acceptable political solution to the problem. The peace movement cannot simply afford to be an onlooker to this lingering armed conflict.  MPC membership in the IMT  Last October 27, 2009, the peace panels in the GRP-MILF talks have agreed on a Framework on Civilian Protection which they have signed in Kuala Lumpur. In a follow-up meeting on December 8‚Äì9, both panels agreed to add on the mandate of the International Monitoring Team the Civil Protection Component (CPC), which is basically aimed at restraining the combatants from any act that will undermine the safety and security of the civilians. To help fulfill this mandate, the peace panels have invited the Mindanao Peoples Caucus together with the Nonviolent Peaceforce to become part of the Civilian Protection Component (CPC) of the IMT. While protection work is not new with MPC, doing the work as IMT is definitely an altogether different function. The opportunity to help alleviate the sufferings of the civilians by doing protection work within a recognized formal mechanism of the government and MILF, however, opens a lot of possibilities to be able to institutionalize protection work. Thus, the MPC accepted the invitation to join the IMT, mindful of the fact that such decision will have to require program adjustments and realignment of some MPC members to join the IMT. A significant achievement of MPC‚Äôs for this period is the evolution of its women program which will primarily focus in operationalizing the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in the Philippine context of the peace and security processes. This will entail mobilizing women leaders in the peace talks, ceasefire monitoring, disaster response, early warning, civilian protection, peacekeeping and security sector reform. Building on the Women Framework on Civilian Protection which was submitted by MPC to the peace panels in September 2009, the women program will pursue the protection work as outlined in that framework parallel to the operations International Monitoring Team.

Life The son of a refiner of iron, he was born on 17 September 1674 at Swin in the parish of Wombourne, Staffordshire. He matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 1 June 1693, graduated B.A. in 1696‚Äì7, and proceeded M.A. at St. Mary Hall in 1703. On 15 November 1708 he was appointed, on the recommendation of Henry Compton, bishop of London, library keeper at Sion College. Legislation passed in 1710 on copyright made Sion College a deposit library.http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iss/archivespec/learn- exhib/exhibitions/sc/sacred/?m=print He was lecturer at the church of St. Alphage between 1712 and 1723, and preached the sermon at Westminster Abbey on the anniversary of the execution of Charles I on 31 January 1714. He was made lecturer at St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1725. He obtained a readership at Christ Church, London, in 1733. Reading died on 10 December 1744. His son Thomas was granted on 28 January 1744 the places of ostiary, under librarian, and clerk assistant at Sion College. Works In 1716 came out his ‚ÄòHistory of our Lord, adorn'd with cuts,‚Äô London, of which a ‚Äòsecond edition, to which is prefixed the Life of the B. Virgin Mary,‚Äô was published in 1717. This work was reprinted at Leeds, 1849‚Äì50, 3 parts, edited by Walter Farquhar Hook. Reading's major work was an edition in Greek and Latin of the early ecclesiastical historians: Eusebius Pamphilus, Socrates Scholasticus, Hermias Sozomenus, Theodoretus, and Evagrius Scholasticus. It was printed at the Cambridge University Press in 1720, in three folio volumes (reprinted at Turin, 1746‚Äì7). The text of Eusebius was republished at Venice, 1770, 3 vols. and again at Leipzig, 1827‚Äì8, under the care of Friedrich Adolph Heinichen. In 1724 Reading printed ‚ÄòTwenty-three Sermons of Mortification, Holiness, and of the Fear and Love of God‚Äô (London, for the author), dedicated to the archbishop of Canterbury; the writer complained that he was ‚Äòalways destitute of any ecclesiastical dignity or revenue.‚Äô On 15 October of the same year he received the additional office of clerk or secretary of Sion College, possibly just after the publication of the compilation ‚ÄòBibliothec√¶ Cleri Londinensis in Collegio Sionensi Catalogus, duplici forma concinnatus,‚Äô of which the first part gives the titles arranged under subjects, and the second is an alphabetical index. Reading appended a history of the college. He printed in 1728 ‚ÄòFifty-two Sermons for every Sunday of the Year,‚Äô London, 2 vols., again dedicated to the archbishop of Canterbury.

Operational maintenance is the care and minor maintenance of equipment using procedures that do not require detailed technical knowledge of the equipment‚Äôs or system‚Äôs function and design. This category of operational maintenance normally consists of inspecting, cleaning, servicing, preserving, lubricating, and adjusting, as required. Such maintenance may also include minor parts replacement that does not require the person performing the work to have highly technical skills or to perform internal alignment. As the term implies, operational maintenance, is performed by the operator of the equipment. Its purpose is threefold: (1) to make the operator aware of the state of readiness of the equipment; (2) to reduce the delays that would occur if a qualified technician had to be called every time a simple adjustment were needed; and (3) to release technicians for more complicated work This form of preventative maintenance can be performed in any setting where machines, equipment, or vehicles are used. This may include manufacturing plants and factories, as well as automotive shops. In many commercial buildings, heating and cooling engineers perform operational maintenance tasks on furnaces, boilers, and air conditioners. Some operational maintenance responsibilities can be as simple as inspecting the machine to spot any changes or issues. This allows the operator to detect a potential danger, such as loose fasteners or debris that could contribute to an accident. Basic cleaning, including removing debris or excess grease from a machine, is also considered part of operational maintenance. Depending on the type of equipment in use, operators may also be responsible for replacing worn out filters or cartridges, or removing and replacing a worn belt, cutting tool, or grinding stone. Operational maintenance may entail keeping machinery well lubricated to reduce the risk of friction or failure. Many basic machine adjustments needed during the course of operation also fall within this category of preventative maintenance.

Career  Zielbauer founded Roadmonkey and coined the phrase \\"adventure philanthropy\\" in 2008, while still a reporter at The New York Times. Roadmonkey has been called \\"a new kind of travel\\" because of its intent to blend off-the-path adventure with hands-on volunteer projects that benefit people and communities in need. O: The Oprah Magazine, writing about Zielbauer, called him \\"a guy we like\\" because it said Roadmonkey seeks to \\"combine physically challenging expeditions with humanitarian efforts.\\" At The New York Times, Zielbauer worked primarily for the Metro desk, where he covered the New York City jail system and reported on the intersection or organized labor and organized crime. During periods in 2006 and 2007, he covered the war in Iraq and the aftermath of the September 2007 killings of civilians in Baghdad's Nisour Square by Blackwater military contractors. In 2007, Zielbauer became The Times' beat reporter on the military justice system, covering high-profile military prosecutions of alleged war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He was detained as a prisoner of conscience for 1, 155 days. Seroney served as the Member of the Legislative Council for Nandi Constituency from 1961 to 1963 and Member of Parliament (MP) for Nandi North from 1963 to 1966 before becoming the Member for the newly formed Tinderet Constituency from 1966 to 1975. As a legislator, he worked hard to introduce bills that would remove or at least check the excessive powers vested in the president as a result of the numerous amendments to the Constitution. He also brought in the first private member's bill to help ensure that Kenya's elections were free, fair and inclusive. In his life, Seroney decried what he described as the wanton abuse of power by the executive and condemned corruption, the unfair distribution of national wealth, theft of land from the poor by the ruling elite, and the failure to resettle the landless. He made powerful enemies, and his detention in harsh prison conditions for three and a half years set in motion the events that eventually led to his death. Early life Jean-Marie Seroney was born to Eric Kipketer Seroney on Monday, 25 July 1927 at Kapsabet, Nandi District of Kenya.From an affidavit sworn in his application to become a Member of the Kenyan Bar (Law Society of Kenya)dated 25 September 1958 He wa the first child of the recently converted Africa Inland Mission (AIM) teacher/evangelist Reuben Seroney and Leah Jeptarus Tapmaina Seroney. Shortly after his birth, the Rev. Stuart M. Bryson took over the Kapsabet AIM Mission. Bryson turned out to be a controversial missionary challenging the deeply held traditions of the Nandi in a bid to increase his numbers. He immediately sent Reuben Seroney to start a new Mission station and school at Surungai some 32 miles north of the Kapsabet Mission.Bryson, Stuart M., Light in Darkness: The Story of the Nandi Bible, Parry Jackman, London 1959, p.64 Reuben and Leah taught at the Surungai School in the afternoons and spent their mornings preaching in the nearby villages.Bryson, Stuart M., Light in Darkness: The Story of the Nandi Bible, Parry Jackman, London 1959, p.65 Two years later, in 1929, Leah unexpectedly died from labour complications. Two years later Reuben married Rebecca Jeptanui. The Seroney family lived in the Surungai Mission until 1933 when Reuben was asked to move to Kapsowar in Elgeyo-Marakwet area to pioneer the new Mission station together with Rev. and Mrs. R. V. Reynolds. The AIM had also started a hospital there which stands to date. Reuben Seroney stayed at Kapsowar as an evangelist and the lead teacher of the school for five years. He visited nearby villages and far-off areas teaching and preaching. It was during one of his visits to Kabartonjo in Tugen country that Reuben Seroney met Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, later to become President of Kenya. He became Moi's teacher and mentor and was instrumental in placing him at Government African School Kapsabet in 1938.\\"President Moi the Man\\" Viva Magazine, OAU Special Issue No. 8, Trend Publishers Ltd., Nairobi, June 1981 p. 43 Education The young Seroney began formal schooling in 1935 at Kapsowar with his father and Mrs. Reynolds as his instructors. Following his father's return to Kapsabet in May 1938, he joined the Government African School at Kapsabet (now Kapsabet High School) from 1938 to 1940.School Records from Kapsabet High School then known as the Government African School - Kapsabet Seroney passed his Primary School Examination and was the only one in his class to be admitted to the Alliance High School in Kikuyu which was then Kenya's only secondary school. He obtained a scholarship from the Local Native Council (LNC) at Kapsabet which paid for him the required Sh. 200 annual fee. Seroney stayed at Alliance from 1941 to 1944, where he studied under Edward Carey Francis.School records from Alliance High School He sat for the Cambridge School Certificate and obtained a Division 1, which meant he could then proceed to Makerere for higher studies. He enrolled at the Makerere College in Kampala, Uganda in 1945 taking the Higher Studies in Arts. At Makerere, he won the prestigious Arts Research Prize. He was the founding President of the Political Society and served as the president of the Dramatic Society in the final year. After performing well at Makerere, he got the Government of India Scholarship to study at the prestigious University of Allahabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. He began his studies there in September 1947 at the William Holland University College, a constituent college of the University of Allahabad. He completed his BA degree in 1949 obtaining a Second-class honours. He began to study for his Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB) at the same university, completed in December 1951 and obtained a first-class honours.Records from his personal file at the Chief Native Commissioner‚Äôs Office (L.F.G. Pritchard) and Director of Education in Kenya (H.A. Curtis) now at the Kenya National Archives Nairobi He became the first Kenyan to hold a law degree. Religion In 1938, Reuben Seroney had a serious misunderstanding with outgoing missionary Stuart M. Bryson and his replacement Reginald V. Reynolds. Bryson was one of the most significant AIM missionaries to the Nandi people (a sub-tribe of the Kalenjin People) and helped translate the Bible into the Nandi language with Rev. Samuel Gimnyigei). Reuben Seroney disagreed with them over Nandi cultural practices that the AIM church continued to strongly oppose as well as the failure of the organization to grant him pastoral authority.Rabai to Mumias: A short history of the Church of the Province of Kenya, 1844-1994, Uzima Press, Nairobi p44 He left the AIM and joined the Native Anglican Church (later changing its name to the African Anglican Church). It was formed by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and which is the forerunner of the Anglican Church of Kenya today. Reuben Seroney moved shortly after his return from Kapsowar in 1939. Reuben Seroney was then licensed to become an evangelist / teacher by the African Church Council of the 'Native Anglican Church' on 29 November 1942.His license is kept by his late grandson, Robert Seroney of Timbilil village in Mogoon, Lessos, Nandi County of Kenya. He rose to become the first Vicar of Nandi in 1950 but died in a road accident on 12 April 1954. He was survived by his wife Rebecca and their twelve children, Jean-Marie, Grace, David, Walter, Graham, Richard, Jean, Agnes, Christine, Tom, Eunice and Levi. =Becoming Catholic= The young Eric Seroney was baptized an Anglican in 1944 but also fell out with his own father in the matter of religion while attending Makerere College in 1946 where he became a Roman Catholic. It was from his conversion to the Catholic faith that he changed his name to John Marie Therese out of his devotion to St. Marie Therese of Liseux. He later Francized and hyphenated the name to Jean-Marie Seroney, dropping the active use of ‚ÄòTherese‚Äô. He remained a practicing Catholic the remainder of his life devoted to St. Therese, even choosing to remain celibate.From his personal journals of 1973 His decision to become a Catholic did not go down well with his father Reuben, who took to task Fr. Joseph Kuhn of the Chepterit Catholic Mission for baptizing his son in 1947. Political activities While in India Jean-Marie Seroney had kept the political pressure on the colonial government by various methods, even publishing an article in the Indian Review of January 1950 entitled 'Threat of South African Fascism to East Africa.'Indian Review, Volume 51, January 1950. p.151. He returned to Kenya in 1951, just in time for the heady days of the independence struggle before the declaration of the Mau Mau Emergency. He addressed public meetings in the African quarter in Nairobi and once accompanied Jomo Kenyatta on a tour of the Rift Valley. The colonial administration in Kenya was impressed with his political activities and so it was felt that he should proceed to England for further studies. In February 1952, he was offered a loan by the Administration and in July 1952 he was admitted to the University College of the South-West of England at Exeter (now the University of Exeter) where he would study for an Intermediate LLB of the University of London and at the same time study for the Bar at the Inner Temple London. Shortly before he went to Exeter, he attended and addressed the World Assembly for Moral Re-Armament in Caux, Switzerland in August 1952 and called for a new way of dealing with the issue of colonialism.From the archives of the World Assembly for Moral Re-Armament in Caux-Sur-Montreux, Switzerland, August 1952 After differences with university authorities at Exeter over what he considered a repetition of his degree at India, he opted to go straight for the Bar instead of going through with the Intermediate LLB. After much struggle with the colonial authorities both in England and in Kenya, he eventually sat for his Bar finals in December 1955, and on 7 February 1956 he was admitted to the Bar of England by the Honorable Society of the Inner Temple. He made history as only the third Kenyan to become a barrister after Chiedo More Gem Argwings-Kodhek and Charles Njonjo, and the first to also hold a Law degree. He returned to Kenya fully qualified to practice Law as a barrister before Her Majesty's High Courts.Affidavit sworn on admission to the Kenyan Bar, September 1958 Employment and entry into politics On his return to Kenya in 1956, Seroney was appointed as a Legal Assistant in the office of the Registrar-General's on 21 June 1956. In December 1957, he was promoted to the position of Public Prosecutor in charge of Bankruptcy offences through a Kenya Gazette notice no. 4067 dated 3 December 1957.The Official Gazette of the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya (1957), the Government Printer, Nairobi On 25 September 1958, he applied to be admitted as a member of the Law Society of Kenya which had just been formed in 1948. Seroney had made history as the second black Kenyan African to qualify in Law after the late Chiedo More Gem Argwings-Kodhek. At the time of his application in 1958 the Hon. Justice Chanan Singh was the Chairman of the Law Society of Kenya.Law Society of Kenya Records, Nairobi. Kenya When he was accepted to the Bar of Kenya he immediately resigned and went into private practice. Seroney continued with covert political activities at the height of Kenya's emergency period in the fifties engaging with many of the early politicians such as Tom Mboya, Oginga Odinga, Dr. Julius Kiano and many others. He even joined Mboya's Airlift program and is known to have helped some Nandi youth to go to America to obtain a higher education. He also joined the Labour movement and became the Secretary-General of the Kenya African Civil Servants Union. He gave legal advice and supported the Independence movement in many ways. It was not until 1959 that Seroney finally ventured into politics proper when he called for the formation of a political party that took the interests of the Africans at heart.Drum Magazine, July 1959, Nairobi, Kenya. The following year he announced his intention to vie for the Nandi open seat at the Legislative Council (LEGCO) on Sunday 27 November 1960.Daily Nation, 28 November 1960, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. In February 1961, at the age of 33, he was elected to the Legislative Council as Member for Nandi, beating his sole rival Shadrack Kimalel. Seroney was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Defence. On 13 February 1962 he was in the Kenyan Delegation to the Lancaster House Conference and the final Independence talks in September 1963. In 1963 he was elected Member of Parliament for Nandi North Constituency on a Kenya African Democratic Union ticket and also took his seat in the regional assembly that met in Nakuru. He crossed the floor, however, and joined the Kenya African National Union together with Taita araap Towett the MP for Bureti and William Murgor the MP for Elgeyo on 21 November 1963. This rubbed many the wrong way especially his friend-turned-foe Daniel arap Moi who had remained in KADU. On 27 November 1963 he invited Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta to address a public rally in Kapsabet and Eldoret.Daily Nation 28 November 1963, Nation Newspapers Ltd. Nairobi He was elected MP for Tinderet in 1966 and served until the elections held in 1969. In the 1969 general elections, he beat his closest rival Francis K. Ruto to win with 9,006 votes against Ruto's 1,699 to reclaim his Tinderet seat. The Nandi Hills Declaration Seroney got in trouble in September 1969 when he presented the controversial \\"Nandi Hills Declaration\\", a document authored by his friend Joseph K. Mitei from Koilot, Ol'Lessos of Nandi District. Mitei was the Organizing Secretary of ruling party KANU, Nandi branch when he wrote the document on 27 July 1969. The document challenged the Kenyatta administration's sale/settlement of Nandi land to non-Kalenjin settlers at the expense of former owners of that land while the other half was a protest on police brutality and the unfair judicial system in Nandi. The document was deemed seditious and Seroney was arrested on Saturday, 20 September 1969 at Eldoret and transported to Nakuru with his friend Mitei and on Tuesday 23 September charged with sedition in a Nakuru court. The defence was led by P.J. Wilkinson QC, a former Attorney General of Uganda assisted by Sibi-Okumu. They were convicted and fined KShs. 6,000 each by Resident Magistrate R.P. Maini.Daily Nation, 24 September 1969, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. Fallout with Moi By now Seroney was not popular with establishment figures especially Daniel Moi who had been appointed as the Vice-President as he seemed to undermine Moi's authority as the sole spokesman of the Kalenjin. He was however quite popular on the ground, much more popular than Moi, who was vice-president. Moi was perceived by the Kalenjin as having watched as their lands were being grabbed by powerful figures in Kenyatta's Government. Moi's appointment as vice-president was seen as a way to placate the Kalenjin in order to settle their lands without a question. Moi and Seroney's differences took a turn when the latter decided to establish the Samoei Institute for Technology and Education in Nandi Hills. Moi instead used state machinations to downgrade the registered institute to a 'harambee' (self-help) secondary school much to the dismay of the people of Nandi. Moi used his control of the provincial administration to ensure that Seroney did not get permits to hold rallies or collect funds for the institute and in the end, the institute was 'deregistered'. Despite motions in Parliament and press battles, Moi in the end proved the stronger of the two. Some strong political forces in the Rift Valley started to gang up against Seroney ahead of the 1974 general election held on 14 October. Most notable was the then Councillor Ezekiel Barngetuny who was Moi's closest confidant in Nandi.Daily Nation, 3 May 1973, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. Despite strong opposition, Seroney retained his seat against Moi's preferred candidates. Realizing that Seroney's differences with Moi were widening, former Uasin Gishu politician Paul Kiplimo Boit, approached Seroney and took him to Moi at Kabarak in a bid to have them bury the hatchet. Seroney met with Moi on 17 November 1974 to iron out their differences - partly for the sake of development and partly to obtain Moi's support ahead of Seroney's bid for the seat of Deputy Speaker that was about to take place. His truce with Moi was short-lived as they resumed their rivalry almost immediately. Deputy Speaker After his victory at the polls, Seroney was determined to add a feather in his cap by going for the seat of Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. He won the seat despite vigorous opposition by no less than President Jomo Kenyatta who uncharacteristically adjourned Parliament for three months in a bid to prevent Seroney from being elected Deputy Speaker. When Parliament resumed on 5 February 1975 Seroney was elected as the Deputy Speaker. Things came to a head after the murder of Nyandarua North Member of Parliament and vocal Government critic Josiah Mwangi Kariuki in March 1975. Seroney sat in the Committee formed to probe the death of Kariuki as its secretary and wrote a damning report accusing Government of being behind his death and for trying to cover it up. Detention without trial On 9 October 1975, Jean-Marie Seroney got in trouble again when as Deputy Speaker of Parliament after he refused to ask Martin Shikuku MP for Butere to substantiate his remark that \\"Kanu was dead\\". He replied to Kihika Kimani who had sought a substantiation of the remarks of Shikuku that \\"why substantiate the obvious...\\". This remark. led to his detention on 15 October 1975 at his office in Parliament at 7:15 pm.‚ÄòDaily Nation‚Äô, 16 October 1975, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. Earlier that day he had sparked heated and bitter debate when he sought the Speaker's ruling on his security after getting wind that policemen were waiting to pick him and Shikuku up. He chaired the afternoon session until 6:30 pm and was picked up as he left his office. He was taken to Manyani Prison where he served in detention without trial for the next three years, losing his parliamentary seat in the process. Shortly, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International as well as the Inter-Parliamentary Union took up his case with the Government of Kenya. Seroney never spoke of his days behind bars. However, those who visited him there said he took it stoically. He suffered terrible withdrawal symptoms from his addiction to tobacco but soon became stable.Interview with Hon. Martin Shikuku, former MP for Butere, Seroney's co-detained, March 2011 He minded his family while behind bars but his finances were seriously taking a beating. Naturally the farms performed poorly and he was unable to pay the school fees for his dependants as well as the rent for their home. He lived in Nairobi's South 'B' area in a City Council house. Seroney was released from detention through a presidential pardon on 12 December 1978. He was released with 25 other prisoners, most of whom were prisoners of conscience. Among them were Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, Koigi wa Wamwere, George Anyona, Martin Shikuku, Wasonga Sijeyo, and others.Daily Nation, 13 December 1978, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. Seroney had spent 1,155 days (three years, two months) in detention without trial, becoming one of Kenya's longest prisoners of conscience. Elections of 1979 In January 1979, just 3 weeks after his release from detention, he was invited together with a large delegation from his Tinderet Constituency to Moi's home at Kabarak on 1 January 1979 ostensibly to begin a new year with new things. During the meeting, President Moi praised Seroney as a good leader and played down their differences, pledging to work with him. He reportedly said that if there were only a few others like Seroney, this nation would be very different. The truce was to last only a few days.Interview with Peter Sang of Eldoret who was present at that meeting, March 2011. Just a week later, another delegation led by Ezekiel Barng'etuny went to Kabarak this time taking a young middle management employee of the Kenya Breweries named Henry Kiprono Kosgey. He was introduced to the gathering of Tinderet constituents at Kabarak as the man for the upcoming elections of 1979. The indefatigable efforts of Ezekiel Barngetuny (who also went on to introduce Samuel Ngeny to beat Simeon Kiptum Choge and Stanley Metto to remove Robert Tanui in Mosop through his famous slogan 'Kibunguok Somok' or 'Three Keys') The election symbol for Kosgey, Ngeny and Metto was the Key which was partially to spite Seroney for having 'locked' away or closed development in Nandi. Barngetuny and others led to the electoral defeat of Seroney on 8 November 1979. All his three 'keys' went in but not without serious illegularities, violence and open rigging. Seroney conceded defeat, pledging to work with the new MP, citing \\"grave irregularities during the election campaign and on the polling day...\\"Daily Nation, 17 November 1979, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. Violence against Seroney Seroney had been physically harassed, beaten and even denied permits to hold public rallies and where he did, they were disrupted. It was clear that someone desperately didn't want him to go back to Parliament. According to Peter Sang, an Eldoret businessman and supporter of Seroney, there was a deliberate scheme to rig out Seroney right from the start. He narrated a story told to him by H. K. Burrows the proprietor of Ogirgir Tea estate who found a mob of rowdy youth that had captured Seroney, roughed him up, spat on him all over, soiled him and mocked him in public as he was on the campaign trail.Interview with Peter Sang, March 2011 Burrows intervened and had Seroney released by the mob. Seroney's supporter John Rugut a colleague of Sang at the Kibwari Tea Estate who witnessed this ordeal. Rugut says he found a dejected Seroney on the scene and helped calm the mob. He whisked Seroney to the safety of his car together with Burrows and drove him off to safety. It is clear that if they had not done that, Seroney might have been killed.Interview with John Rugut of Kapsimotwa, Nandi Hills, April 2011. It was soon clear that his re-election efforts were futile. He lost by an unreasonably huge margin. It was not probable, but it happened. On 16 November 1979 he issued a press statement pledging to work with the new MP and pledging his loyalty to President Moi.Daily Nation‚Äô, 17 November 1979, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya.  Investment and destitution  In 1975, Seroney purchased 1,546 acres of former Kapkures Sisal Estates in his Tinderet Constituency. He renamed it 'Kibois Farm' which was in turn owned by the Kaprotuk Estates Ltd of which he was a majority shareholder. He took a loan of KSh 1,035,000 from the Standard Chartered Bank and the National Bank of Kenya to finance the acquisition. By 15 May 1980 he owed a whopping KShs. 1,545,012.15From his personal journal of 1980 (adjusted to 2018 approximately Kshs. 1 billion, or US$10 million). His farming deteriorated significantly and Seroney was unable to service his huge loan. He faced imminent foreclosure and desperately tried to seek the help of the Government to at least waive off his interest for the time he was in detention now that he had not been tried and found guilty of any offence. His pleas fell on deaf ears leading him deep into a state of depression, turning him deep into alcoholism. In 1980, in an tokenistic gesture, Moi appointed Seroney as the Chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of Kenya (IDB) which was not a paid position and was merely a ceremonial head. He worked with Dr. Julius Gikonyo Kiano his longtime friend and onetime Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister. The Minister for Industry which the IDB came under was Andrew Omanga. Seroney's office at the IDB headquarters along Harambee Avenue Nairobi where the offices remain to date. Although the appointment was of little benefit to him financially, it helped put him in the limelight at least for the duration until his death while in office two years later. Constant financial worries and deeper fears of his own failings drove him to a state of depression and he withdrew from the public only limiting his brief appearance in the Press to official matters. Death and controversy On the afternoon of Tuesday, 30 November 1982 Seroney was admitted at MP Shah Hospital in Nairobi complaining of chest pains. He had been unwell for a number of days, avoiding going to hospital. His secretary then called a doctor who took him to hospital from his house in Mariakani (South B) Nairobi. He spent 5 days in the general ward and was due to be discharged on Friday of that week. However, his condition took a sudden turn for the worse shortly after a visit by some of his most ardent opponents. He was taken to ICU on Saturday where was put under further treatment when his condition worsened. On Monday 6 December at 6:45 am Hon. Jean- Marie Seroney died. His personal doctor Dr. Nalini P. Mandevia said that he died of \\"hepatitis failure, jaundice and anemia\\"Daily Nation, 7 December 1982, Nation Newspapers Ltd, Nairobi Kenya. Questions arose immediately about his death and many people could not believe the cause of death as stated. Curiously, no post-mortem was done. President Moi sent a message of condolence to his family stating that he had learned with \\"deep sorrow\\" of the untimely death of Seroney. He died just 6 days shy of the fourth anniversary of his release. His funeral was held on 13 December 1982 in a ceremony that was attended by President Moi and thousands of his friends and constituents at Ko'lelach Village, Senetwo Village, Meteitei, Tinderet. This was the fourth anniversary of his release. However, the farm where he was buried was later sold by the bank to recover the 1975 loan. His former house is now a school and his grave is a part of the playground. Legacy Seroney is a hero of Kenya's independence for which he worked for tirelessly from as early as 1950. When he returned from India in 1951 he joined KAU and popularized it with a tour of the Rift Valley with Jomo Kenyatta before Kenyatta was detained the following year. Through his close friendship with Tom Mboya he helped organize the famous 'Air Lifts' that sent many Kenyan's to universities in the United States starting from the late fifties. He also offered valuable legal advice to Tom Mboya during the pre-independence period and also helped many Mau Mau victims find legal help. As a member of the Legislative Council and the National Assembly, he worked tirelessly to repeal repressive Colonial-era laws such as the Chief's Authority Act, Public Order Act, Laibon Removal Ordinance, Trespass Act and many more. Seroney helped champion social justice, the rule of law and democracy through much of the early independence years of Kenya. His ideas of Devolution which he kept active through much of the sixties and seventies are now part of the Constitution of Kenya(2010). In 1969 Seroney is on record as having called for the release from detention of Oginga Odinga following his detention after the Kisumu riots. He called for the Government to clear Odinga and members of his Party the Kenya People's Union before the elections and to end the practice of detention without trial. He vigorously opposed attempts to make Kenya a single-party state strongly rooting for pluralism and political tolerance as well as national cohesion with the presence of an active parliamentary opposition to check government. He championed press freedom famously calling for a 'free, frank and fearless' press in Kenya.Daily Nation, 26 July 1969, East African Newspapers (Nation Series) Ltd., Nairobi, p.5 The statement was until recently been used by the Kenyan newspaper the 'People Daily' as its slogan. Seroney also became the first private individual to sponsor a bill which he drafted single-handedly to try and rectify the problems associated with the Kenyan elections. After much opposition, his bill was taken over by the Attorney General Charles Njonjo and modified to make Seroney's sweeping changes more tame and then labeled a government bill. It was later discarded anyway leading to serious problems that continue to affect Kenya's elections. Seroney vigorously fought against Corruption in the Kenyatta and Moi Administrations and helped Martin Shikuku come up with a Bill to fight the vice in Kenya. Like his earlier attempt to reform elections, Shikuku's bill too had no chances. As one of his last acts as Deputy Speaker, Seroney established a parliamentary committee to look into the powers and privileges of Members of Parliament. He wanted to make parliament a truly independent organ of government and MPs independent servants of the people. This again was brought to an effective end following his own detention in 1975. Seroney initiated various development projects in his Tinderet Constituency culminating with the Samoei Institute of Technical Education (SITE) which although it was downgraded by Moi to a secondary school, it has since been elevated to the proposed Koitalel Samoei University College, a constituent college of the University of Nairobi. Seroney's biography A biographical book entitled Just for Today: The Life and Times of Jean-Marie Seroney by Godfrey K. Sang was launched at Jesus College, Oxford on 13 November 2015 by former Prime Minister Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga.

From his letters to his brother Charles Whibley he appears to have been involved in gold mining. The Klondike Gold Rush began in 1896 although clearly Whibley did not find success as in 1898 he wrote to Charles Whibley asking whether his brother had repaid $15 to Gordon T Legg, who was the manager of the Union Steamship Company of British Columbia. Fred Whibley had borrowed the money to travel from Vancouver B.C., to Sydney, Australia, where his sister Eliza was living with her husband John T. Arundel. Fred Whibley had the reputation as the black sheep of what was otherwise a respectable Victorian era family.

Whibley appears to be one of those Europeans who chose to live on an isolated Pacific atoll as an escape from the constraints and social expectations of respectability in the Victorian era.Europeans on Pacific islands in the 19th century are considered by Milcairns, Susanne Williams. 2006.

The girls are still known in Tuvalu as \\"the stolen ones\\". The end of the era of European traders During the time Whibley was an island trader, structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies with the trading companies moving from a practice of having traders resident on each island to trade with the islanders to a business operation whether the supercargo (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship would visit an island. From 1900 the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined so that by 1909 there were no resident palagi traders representing the trading companies.Doug Munro, The Lives and Times of Resident Traders In Tuvalu: An Exercise in History from Below, (1987) 10(2) Pacific Studies 73, citing, Mahaffy, Arthur 1909 ‚ÄúReport . . . on the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorates.‚Äù CO 225/86/26804; Wallin, F. 1910 ‚ÄúReport of 30 January 1910 on the Gilbert, Ellice and Marshall Islands‚Äù, BPh Whibley died on Funafuti in 1919.

Medal table The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and is consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \\"nation\\" is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code. Two bronze medals were awarded in each dartchery, snooker, table tennis and lawn bowls event. Some swimming events did not award silver or bronze medals.

The action occurred on May 7, 1861, three weeks after the start of the American Civil War (Civil War) at Fort Sumter in the harbor at Charleston, South Carolina on April 14, 1861. The Gloucester Point engagement is notable as the earliest exchange of gunfire between the Union Navy and organized Rebel (Confederate) forces after the U.S. Army surrendered Fort Sumter to the Confederates and as the earliest reported Civil War military engagement in Virginia. Like other early engagements between Union gunboats and Confederate shore batteries, the battle at Gloucester Point was part of the Union Navy effort to blockade the Southern States in general and the Chesapeake Bay in particular. The engagement also was part of the effort by Confederate forces to deny the use of rivers in Virginia to Union military and commercial traffic. Background On April 15, 1861, the day after the U.S. Army garrison surrendered Fort Sumter to Confederate forces, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to reclaim federal property which had been seized by the Confederates and to suppress the incipient rebellion of the seven Deep South Slave states which had formed the Confederate States of America (the Confederacy). Four Upper South States which also permitted slavery, including Virginia, refused to furnish troops for this purpose.Hansen, Harry. The Civil War: A History. New York: Bonanza Books, 1961. . p. 48 These States immediately began the process of secession from the Union in order to join the Confederacy. On April 17, 1861, the delegates previously elected to the Virginia Secession Convention in Richmond, Virginia passed an ordinance of secession from the Union.Scharf, John Thomas. History of the Confederate States Navy From Its Organization to the Surrender of Its Last Vessel. New York: Rogers & Sherwood, 1887, p. 39. . Retrieved February 1, 2011 The ordinance was subject to a ratification vote of the people of the state to be held on May 23, 1861. Nonetheless, the actions of the convention and Virginia's Governor John Letcher effectively took Virginia out of the Union before the vote could be taken.Hansen, 1961, p. 34 In particular, the convention authorized the governor to call for volunteers to join the military forces of Virginia to defend the state against Federal military action. On April 22, 1861, Governor Letcher appointed Robert E. Lee commander in chief of Virginia‚Äôs army and navy forces. On April 24, 1861, Virginia and the Confederate States agreed that the Virginia forces would be under the overall direction of the Confederate President pending completion of the process of Virginia joining the Confederate States. These developments showed Virginia would complete the process of secession. Therefore, President Lincoln did not wait for the vote of the people of Virginia on the issue of secession before he took action that treated Virginia as part of the Confederacy. On April 27, 1861, Lincoln extended the blockade of the seven original Confederate States which he had declared on April 19, 1861 to include the ports of Virginia and North Carolina.Long, E. B. and Barbara Long. The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac, 1861-1865\\\\. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1971. . p. 66 On May 3, 1861, Major General Robert E. Lee of the Virginia forces appointed Colonel William B. Taliaferro commander of defenses at Gloucester Point, Virginia on the York River opposite Yorktown, Virginia. General Lee instructed the colonel to cooperate with Virginia Navy Captain William C. Whittle in the construction and defense of a shore battery to cover the York River at that location.Scharf, 1887, p. 107 On May 6, 1861, Taliaferro ordered a company of fifty men of the Richmond Howitzers, a Virginia volunteer artillery regiment, with two six-pounder cannons, to report to Gloucester Point to assist in the defense and operation of the shore battery. The artillerymen arrived at Gloucester Point early on May 7, 1861.Gordon, E. Clifford. The Battle of Big Bethel. Richmond, VA: Carlton McCarthy and Co., 1883.

This force had not yet been formally transferred to the Confederate States Army or Confederate States Navy, but the Virginians were acting in concert with the Confederacy and in its defense. Battle In early May 1861, the Union Navy already had learned that rebel Virginia forces were constructing fortifications at Gloucester Point, Virginia on the York River. On May 7, 1861, Union Flag Officer Garrett J. Pendergrast ordered Navy Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. to examine the reported fortifications. On the same day, Lieutenant Selfridge, in command of the USS Yankee, a converted steam tugboat of 328 tons displacement with 2 guns, sailed the Yankee up the York River in a reconnaissance with the purpose of developing intelligence on the fortifications at Gloucester Point.Neeser, Robert Wilden.

The Yankee fired 4 shots and 2 shells at the battery in return. Selfridge stated that he could not hit the opposing force's guns because of their elevation and because his guns were too small to damage the battery and fortifications in any event. The Yankee's guns were \\"light 32s\\". Selfridge opined that the Rebels had 2 \\"long 32s\\" and an \\"8-inch shell\\". He thought the rebels had a force of about 40 men. In fact, the battery only had smaller \\"six-pounder\\" guns on this date. After this exchange of cannon fire, the Yankee turned around and headed for its base at Hampton Roads near Fort Monroe. Selfridge did not mention damage to the Yankee in his report. T. Roberts Baker of the Virginia force recalled that two shots from the battery hit the Yankee. Neither side reported any of their men as killed or wounded. Despite Baker‚Äôs later account that Colonel Taliaferro directed the actions of the Richmond Howitzers at Gloucester Point on May 7,Baker, 1884, p. 5 Colonel Taliaferro stated in a report on May 8, 1861, that he arrived at Gloucester Point after the engagement had taken place.

The term was coined by Eugenie Scott and named after the creationist Duane Gish, who used the technique frequently against proponents of evolution.  Technique and countermeasures  During a Gish gallop, a debater confronts an opponent with a rapid series of many specious arguments, half-truths, and misrepresentations in a short space of time, which makes it impossible for the opponent to refute all of them within the format of a formal debate. In practice, each point raised by the \\"Gish galloper\\" takes considerably more time to refute or fact-check than it did to state in the first place. The technique wastes an opponent's time and may cast doubt on the opponent's debating ability for an audience unfamiliar with the technique, especially if no independent fact-checking is involved or if the audience has limited knowledge of the topics. Generally, it is more difficult to use the Gish gallop in a structured debate than in a free-form one. If a debater is familiar with an opponent who is known to use the Gish gallop, the technique may be countered by pre-empting and refuting the opponent's commonly used arguments first, before the opponent has an opportunity to launch into a Gish gallop.

Life He was born at Falkirk, Stirlingshire, on 3 February 1787. His parents moved to Edinburgh, where in 1792 he began his education under a schoolmaster named Waugh. On 1 July 1800 he was apprenticed for five years to a wheelwright and turner. His father died in October 1803. About this time Orme came under the influence of James Alexander Haldane, whose preaching at the Tabernacle in Leith Walk, Edinburgh, had attracted him. In October 1805 he was admitted by Robert Haldane as a student for the ministry at a seminary under George Cowie. The usual term of study was two years, but Orme's periods of study, interrupted by a preaching mission in Fife (1806), amounted to little more than a year in all. On 11 March 1807 he became pastor of the congregational church at Perth where he was ordained. About 1809 he broke with Robert Haldane, in consequence of Haldane's adoption of Baptist views, and took part in the controversy that arose. He declined a call to the congregational church at Dundee. In the development of Scottish congregationalism he took an active part, especially aiding in the formation (1813) of the Congregational Union of Scotland, and in the establishment (1814) of a divinity hall at Glasgow. On 7 October 1824, he became pastor of the congregational church at Camberwell Green, Surrey, and soon afterwards was elected foreign secretary of the London Missionary Society. He died in his prime on 8 May 1830, and was buried on 17 May at Bunhill Fields. His portrait, engraved by Thomson from a painting by Wildman, was published in the Evangelical Magazine for January 1830. He was twice married, and left a widow. Works He published, in addition to separate sermons and pamphlets: * 'Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Religious Connections of John Owen, D.D.,‚Äô &c.;, 1820. * 'Remarkable Passages in the Life of William Kiffin,‚Äô &c.;, 1823. * 'Bibliotheca Biblica ... List of Books on Sacred Literature, with Notices, Biographical, Critical,‚Äô &c.;, Edinburgh, 1824. * 'Memoirs, including ‚Ä¶ Remains of John Urquhart,‚Äô &c.;, 1827, 2 vols. Posthumous was: * 'Life and Times of Richard Baxter,‚Äô &c.;, 1830, 2 vols. This was partly printed at the time of his death; it was edited by Thomas Russell. It accompanied an edition of Baxter's 'Practical Works,‚Äô begun by Orme in 1827. The second volume contains a detailed critique of Baxter's writings. His two volumes on Richard Baxter were commended by Sir James Stephen. Andrew Thomson superseded him as a biographer of John Owen, and Joseph Ivimey for William Kiffin.

It was first described by Philipp Christoph Zeller in 1849. Distribution and habitat This species can be found in all of Europe (except Ireland), in Siberia, Asia Minor, Syria, Iraq and Altai.Funet - Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms These rather vulnerable moths mainly occur in field edges, grassy slopes and scrubland. Description In Coleophora conspicuella the wingspan can reach 13‚Äì17.5 mm. Forewings of these moths have pale yellow ground colour, with pale streaks and white subcostal stripes, without oblique streaks to costa. Antennae are white, unringed and the scape shows a long tuft. Biology The larvae mine leaves and feed on Aster amellus, Aster linosyris, Aster sedifolius, Aster sedifolius canus, Centaurea aspera, Centaurea jacea, Centaurea montana, Centaurea nigra, Centaurea scabiosa and Chrysanthemum species. They create and live within a movable relatively large, dark brown, lightly curved two-valved sheath case with a narrow ventral keel. It is about 12‚Äì15 mm long and has a mouth angle of 30-45¬∞. Full-grown larvae can be found in May.

However, it was eventually agriculture and the training of scientific, practical agriculturalists that eventually caught his imagination. In 1887 he accepted the position of Principal to the Aspatria Agricultural College, a radical institution in the North of England, which a group of enthusiastic amateurs had established in 1874, for the purpose of training the sons of tenant farmers and farm labourers. In 1891 he became sole owner of the College, which he rebuilt and under his guidance it became one of the foremost seats of agricultural learning in England. He was also a successful world record holding cyclist and tricyclist.  Early life  Webb was born at Upper Norwood in 1846, the son of a Professor of Botany and Rural Economy.  Education  Webb began his education at Blackheath, where he passed the Oxford and Cambridge senior examination. On leaving school he became junior English and Science master at Cranford College, Maidenhead. After three years of teaching experience he gained a First Class pass in the matriculation examination set by the University of London. He also obtained a scholarship in biology from the School of Mines, South Kensington; where he studied Zoology, Botany, Chemistry, Experimental Physics and Geology. After three years study he entered University College, London. In 1884 he graduated in first place with a BSc First Class Honours degree in Botany. He also entered an examination for the Licentiate of the College of Preceptors, where he took first place and the Council Prize for natural science.  Career  After a period of teaching, Webb entered University College Hospital, where after two years he passed the examination of the College of Physicians and the intermediate examination for a Bachelor of Medicine. His next appointment was that of Professor of Animal morphology and Physiology at the Birkbeck Institute. During this period he also lectured on Botany at University College School. It was at this juncture that he became interested in agricultural education and after passing an examination with honours at the South Kensington College he proceeded to France to study a variety of agricultural teaching methods. In 1886, after attending Jena University in Germany, he gained his PhD, writing a treatise on the sexual differences of plants. Upon his return to England, Webb applied for the vacant position of Principal to the Aspatria Agricultural College and was accepted in the fore of 120 applicants.West Cumberland Times, 15 April 1889 Shortly after taking over the role of Principal at Aspatria, he entered a government sponsored examination in the subjects of Agriculture and Agricultural Chemistry, where he finished in first place ahead of forty prominent entrants.West Cumberland Times, 12 September 1887 Sporting achievements Webb was cousin to Captain Matthew Webb (1848‚Äì1883), the first recorded person to swim the English Channel, who later lost his life attempting to swim through the Whirlpool rapids below Niagara Falls. Henry was a celebrated athlete in his own right. He was the first to cycle the return journey between London and Portsmouth in a single day. In 1884, he won over ¬£200 in prize money, winning the world tricycle championship at The Crystal Palace; and the national championship, which he completed on the Great North Road in 7 hours 35 minutes. Although he held world records at 1/4, 2, 15, 26 and 100 miles, his greatest sporting achievement came after he rode from Lands End to John O'Groats in a time of 7 days 58 minutes cutting 16 hours 47 minutes off the previous record; a phenomenal achievement, in the days before the invention of a freewheel, braking being performed by back treading.West Cumberland Times, 29 November 1893 Parliamentary commission The emblem of the Aspatria Agricultural College In 1887, in the depth of the agricultural depression, the British Government instigated a Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Richard Paget, 1st Baronet, to enquire into the working activities of Agricultural Colleges and Dairy Schools for the purpose of awarding Government grants.West Cumberland Times, 12 November 1887 Previous to this report agriculture's only support had been in the form of grants, awarded to maintain students sitting for the theoretical examination of the Science and Arts Department, South Kensington College, London (the S. & A.D.). The commissioners were very critical and highlighted the national cost of inadequate agricultural education and poor Dairy practice. Since the Aspatria Agricultural College was the only institution of its kind in England to provide agricultural education for the sons of tenant farmers and to give elementary instruction in science to farm labourers, Webb was called to give evidence. He described his views as contrary to those held by contemporary authorities in Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Cambridge. These administrations, he argued, promoted only scientific and theoretic instruction at the expense of practical work. Webb described his prime objective as reinforcing theoretical knowledge with the practical experience gained from daily instruction on farms, as embodied in the college motto \\"Scientia et Labore\\". He also stressed the importance of educating people, irrespective of their age. Webb's advice appears to have carried favour, for the Commission recognised. In their published report the Commission recognised many of the faults appertaining to agricultural education and recommended the need for state aid. Their primary proposal endorsed the immediate creation of five regional Dairy Schools in England. Each endowed with an annual working grant of ¬£500. Grants were also available for purchasing buildings, while a further award of ¬£200 was available for equipment and fittings. They made one additional grant and this was a sum of ¬£300 awarded to the Aspatria College. In the ensuing four years Aspatria received a total of ¬£1,350 in government grants.West Cumberland Times, 12 February 1888 Technical education The Science laboratory at Aspatria Agricultural College An Act by the British parliament in 1888, created Local Authorities in the form of County Councils. The 1889 Technical Education Act allowed these authorities to fund technical and manual instruction out of the rates. In the same year the government established the Board of Agriculture. In 1891, the Technical Education Committee of the Cumberland County Council embarked on their programme of travelling lectures and practical demonstrations. In response, Webb elected to offer instruction on a wide range of agricultural and mining related subjects; and once commissioned threw the entire weight of his enthusiasm into the action. Webb was afterwards appointed lecturer on dairying under the Cumberland County Council, and was a strong advocate of a scientific system of butter making instead of the 'rule of thumb' methods usually applied by farmer's wives. Webb was also engaged as a lecturer on agriculture under the County Council of Lancashire and Cumberland.West Cumberland, Times 12 February 1888 Academic publications Webb wrote a multitude of articles and papers and had at least 6 books published within his lifetime. Titles include: * Elementary Agriculture: A Text Book etc., (Longmann London 1894) * Advanced Agriculture, (Longmann 1891 London) * Agriculture: A Manual for Advanced Science Students, (Longmann London 1914) * Principles of Agriculture, (Longmann London 1889) * The Art of Butter Making * The Dairy and its Equipment, with Practical Management of Milk and Cream Milk: Its Composition and Mode of Production * The Feeding of Dairy Cattle Death In mid November 1893, a group of masters and students competed in a ‚Äòpaper chase'. Unfortunately the day was not without its mishaps; and a student named Hammack slipped and gashed his foot on a protruding rock. A minor injury by today's standards, but blood poisoning set in and three weeks later the student died. It was a well-attended funeral.West Cumberland Times, 22 November 1893 Webb headed a procession of fifty students, who walked in a file from the college to the churchyard. The weather was hostile and later that day Webb developed a chill that quickly evolved into a severe case of pneumonia and death was sudden.Maryport Advertiser, 2 December 1893 A contemporary obituary summed up his life in the following manner: ReferencesBibliography * Category:People from Aspatria Category:1846 births Category:1893 deaths Category:English agriculturalists Category:English male cyclists Category:Agriculture educators Category:Alumni of University College London ","title":"Henry J.

He lost the use of his legs when a pine tree he was chopping down fell on his back. He is included in Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame of the International Paralympic Committee. Biography Marson made his first Paralympic appearance, representing Italy, in the second ever Games in Tokyo, Japan, in 1964. He competed in three different sports: athletics, wheelchair fencing and swimming. In athletics he won two gold medals and two silver medals, setting a new world record of 24.20 metres in the men's javelin C classification. He finished fourth in both of the freestyle swimming events in which he competed. In the individual fencing events Marson won silver in √©p√©e and sabre, but alongside compatriots Franco Rossi and Rengo Rogo he won a team √©p√©e gold medal and a team sabre bronze medal. On 30 August 2012 in London during Summer Paralympics, Marson's daughter received the award Visa Paralympic Hall of Fame. At the 1968 Summer Paralympics held in Tel Aviv, Israel, Marson was proclaimed the outstanding athlete of the Games after winning ten gold medals; three in athletics field events, three in swimming and four in wheelchair fencing. His swimming golds all came on the same day as he won the 50 metres events for freestyle, breaststroke and backstroke. In wheelchair fencing he won individual gold for √©p√©e, foil and sabre. He was joined by Giovanni Ferraris, Vittorio Loi, Franco Rossi and Germano Zanarotto to defeat France 5-4 in the final and win gold for Italy in the team foil. With Ferraris and Zanarotto he won a silver in team sabre and also won silver in the team √©p√©e alongside Loi and Rossi. He successfully defended the Paralympic javelin and discus titles that he had won in Tokyo and added a third athletics gold medal in the club throw and a bronze in the shot put. In 1972 at the Paralympics in Heidelberg, Marson contested a single athletics event and four wheelchair fencing events. He finished fourth in the men's discus 4 event with the gold being won by Canadian Eugene Reimer. In the individual √©p√©e, individual sabre and team √©p√©e events he retained his Paralympic titles, but his Italian team was beaten to the gold medal in the team sabre by Great Britain. Marson's final Paralympic Games came in 1976 in Toronto, Canada. He failed to win medals in either of his athletic events or the individual wheelchair fencing events, but did take a bronze medal in the men's team √©p√©e. He was President of Federazione Italiana Sport Handicappati from 1980 until 1990. He died in 2011 and in 2012 he was inducted into the International Paralympian Hall of Fame.

Life He was born at Marden, Kent, on 5 November 1781. His father and grandfather were members of the Church of England, and he was confirmed as an Anglican; but was trained for the dissenting ministry at Hoxton Academy (September 1800‚ÄìJune 1803), under Robert Simpson, D.D. His first settlement was at Tonbridge, Kent, in 1803. In 1806 he became minister of Pell Street Chapel, Ratcliff Highway, where he was ordained on 5 September; but his ministry was not popular. About 1820 he adopted his mother's maiden name of Russell, and in 1823 obtained the king's patent for the change. Soon afterwards he received from a Scottish university the diploma of M.A. On the closure of Pell Street Chapel a few years before his death, he became minister of Baker Street Chapel, Enfield, Middlesex. He was a Coward trustee and, from 1842, a trustee of the foundations of Daniel Williams; he was also secretary of the Aged Ministers' Relief Society. Contrary to the general sentiment of congregationalists, he was a promoter of the Dissenters' Chapels Act of 1844. He died at his residence, Penton Row, Walworth, Surrey, on 10 December 1846. Arthur Tozer Russell and John Fuller Russell were his sons. Works His tastes were literary, and he edited a collection of hymns as an appendix to Isaac Watts. Under the name of Cloutt he published four sermons (1806‚Äì18), and the Collection of Hymns, (1813). His Jubilee Sermon (1809) was roughly handled in the Anti-Jacobin Review, November 1809, and he issued a defensive \\"Appendix\\", giving some autobiographical details. In 1823 he began his edition of the works of John Owen, finishing it in 1826 in twenty octavo volumes, uniform with the Life of Owen (1820), by William Orme; sets were completed by prefixing this Life, and adding the seven volumes of Owen on Hebrews (Edinburgh, 1812‚Äì14), edited by James Wright. Russell's edition was superseded by that of William Henry Goold, D.D.

Born in Britain, he worked chiefly in Rome. Biography Alexander Day was born ca. 1751. He trained with the portrait-painter, Ozias Humphry. In 1774 Day travelled to Rome, where he would remain for some forty years, associating with other British and continental artists, such as James Nevay, Thomas Jones, Angelica Kauffman and Vincenzo Pacetti, and selling Old Master paintings and his own miniatures to British visitors, such as Frederick Augustus Hervey, Richard Worsley and Philip Yorke. He bought many paintings from the dealer, Pietro Cammuccini, and sold them on to British collectors. In 1800 Day returned to Britain, where he exhibited many works by old masters, which were sold into the collections of John Julius Angerstein and others. He returned to Italy in 1802, and in that year sent more paintings and contemporary sculpture to London for sale. In 1815 Day returned to Britain permanently.

The colliery eventually had five shafts and became the largest colliery on the Lancashire Coalfield with access to around 270 million tons of coal under the Permian rocks to the south. History In 1862 work started at Mosley Common to sink three shafts to a depth of 500 yards in an area where coal had been mined for some time. The old workings were originally called Stonehouse Pits but the new colliery was sunk to access the deeper seams earlier mining had not reached. The sinking of the 12 feet diameter No 1 shaft encountered much water and massive pumps installed from John Musgrave & Sons in Bolton who also built the winding engine which survived until 1964.Production started in 1868 from the Crombouke mine. Some of the first miners came from other Bridgewater Trustees pits whose coal reserves were becoming exhausted. No 2 pit was sunk to 535 yards. The shaft at No 4 pit was 18 feet 6 inches in diameter was sunk to the Trencherbone mine at 602 yards in 1881. Its winding engine was a product of the Haigh Foundry and it had a steel lattice headframe. This shaft was deepened to 1,000 yards and a Koepe tower winder was built in 1961. The upcast ventilation shaft was No 3 pit sunk to 535 yards, it had a winding engine for winding men not coal. An electric power generating house was built in 1915 and a tall chimney for the boiler plant built in 1916. The Lancashire boilers were supplied by Galloways. In 1923 the Mosley Common, Nos 1, 2 and 5 pits employed 1,338 underground and 198 surface workers while Nos 3 and 4 pits employed 951 underground and 143 above ground. The colliery became part of Manchester Collieries in 1929 when Bridgewater Collieries joined the company. By 1933 while part of Manchester Collieries the combined total for the pits was 1,729 underground and 489 on the surface rising to 1,711 and 531 in 1940. In 1947, at nationalisation, Mosley Common Nos 1 & 2 pits employed 978 underground and 406 surface workers while No 4 pit employed a further 853 underground and 221 on the surface. Mosley Common Colliery was one of the country's largest and most modern pits after refurbishment and development work by the National Coal Board completed in 1962. It was turned into a \\"superpit\\" at a cost of ¬£7.5 million and employed 3000 workers. The colliery closed in 1968 after being set impossible production targets though its coal reserves had not been exhausted. The site was cleared by 1974.

After his return to Albania, he joined the Albanian army in 1927 as a soldier in the artillery school of Tirana and was in military service until his dismissal for alleged subversive behavior in 1935. In 1941 he joined the newly founded Albanian Communist Party and became a member of the Provisional Central Committee, on whose behalf he took over the party organization in his home town of Gjirokast√´r. During World War II, he was one of the main communist leaders of the partisan forces of the Albanian National Liberation Front. For his deeds and bravery he was awarded numerous orders and medals.

History  Two different UAV's, IAI Heron and Searcher Mark II, were acquired from IAI Malat by the Indian Navy in December 2002. The aim of inducting these UAV's was to perform maritime reconnaissance, search & rescue, battle damage assessment and providing OTOHT data. 16 internal pilots, 11 observers, 8 external pilots, 6 technical officers and 75 technical and non-technical sailors underwent training in 2002 at IAI Malat. On 31 August 2002, the Intensive Flying and Trials Unit (IFTU) was established at INS Garuda and was tasked with the roles of aircraft acceptance, operator & crew training, evaluation & trials of aircraft and sensors, doctrine formulation, establishing operating & maintenance procedures. Flight training commenced in January 2003 and the OEM withdrew gradually as the unit personnel began gaining expertise. Routine and training flying finally translated into operational exploitation and the unit started regularly participating in exercises off both coasts from ships and from various military and non- military airfields. Training of technical officers and sailors was also taken up by the OJT cell to hand over the freshly acquired expertise to successive generations of maintainers. On 6 January 2006, IFTU was formally commissioned as an operational squadron, INAS 342. The first Officer-in-Charge was Commander Rajesh Kawatra. Today, INAS 342 has evolved into a fully functional squadron and pioneered a new era in aviation. INAS 342 has 12 Israeli-built IAI Herons and Searcher Mark IIs UAVs. The Searcher is a third-generation UAV. The Searcher MkII has a cruise speed of about 100 knots, a service ceiling of 20,000 feet and an 18-hour endurance. The Heron can touch speeds of over 100 knots with a service ceiling of 30,000 feet and an endurance of 40 hours. Heron is the bigger version of Searcher MKII and has a wingspan of about 16 metres. The Searcher carries a modern and sophisticated electro optic camera and a communication intelligence payload. Heron is equipped with a maritime patrol radar. Both the UAVs have long endurance capabilities, can operate before and after sunset and beam real time live pictures of maritime targets.

Since 2011 it hosts the Gallerie di Piazza Scala where are exposed many artworks from the collections of Fondazione Cariplo. La Scala (on the left) and the BCI palace (on the right) History In the early 20th century, the centre of Milan gradually evolved into a prominently financial district. BCI decided to establish a new, more prestigious headquarters building in the area.La sede della Banca Commerciale Italiana Architect Luca Beltrami was chosen as the main designer, both because of his renowned talent, and because his fame and personal influence was expected to be helpful in achieving the permissions needed for the work, including permission to demolish a baroque church that occupied part of the designated area for the BCI building.Attilia Lanza, Milano e i suoi palazzi: Porta Vercellina, Comasina e Nuova. Libreria Meravigli Editrice, 1993, pp. 138-139 Besides the church, also the \\"Caff√© Martini\\" caf√© (which was renowned as a gathering place for the Milanese patriots who had fought in the Five Days of Milan) was demolished. Architecture Despite the popularity of Art Nouveau in the Milanese architecture of the early 20th century, Beltrami chose to base his design on the neoclassical style. The reason was twofold: on one hand, the neoclassical style was best fit to represent the authority and decorum of a large bank as the Banca Commerciale Italiana; on the other hand, this design created a symmetry with La Scala theatre, which occupies another side of the same plaza. In fact, La Scala was Beltrami's major inspiration. The main element of the marble facade is the central pediment, with its large columns. The interior of the building (which is still partially preserved), was also decorated in neoclassical style; the hall and the large staircase are the most notable elements. The design also included an underground store, mainly used for safe boxes; some of the original safes, in cast iron, are preserved.
