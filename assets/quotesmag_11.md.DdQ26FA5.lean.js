It is roughly bounded by South 1st, South 4th, South Jacobs, and South Pecan Streets, centered on the courthouse square. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, the district includes the Shackelford County Courthouse and a number of surrounding Victorian buildings dating from the from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. History Shackelford County was established in 1858, and its county seat was placed at Albany, Texas, in 1874. A wood-frame courthouse was raised in 1875, and a county jail (now the Old Jail Art Center) was built alongside it in 1878. Sixteen lots with frontages were platted on each side of the courthouse square, which became the center of the growing town. In 1881 Albany became a terminus of the Texas Central Railroad, after which people and businesses moved to the county seat from surrounding settlements. Most of the structures built around the courthouse prior to the arrival of the railroad were wood-frame residences, but in the 1880s more commercial and civic structures went up around the square, the majority built of stone. A Presbyterian Church was raised in 1882. In 1883 one of the houses on the square was repurposed as Albany's first public school, and a two-story bank building raised that year later became City Hall. The first courthouse was torn down in 1883 and replaced by the current Shackelford County Courthouse in 1884. By the 1890s numerous shops, residences, and hotels had been erected on the lots around the square. Since the early twentieth century few alterations have been made to the structures in the courthouse district, with the youngest buildings dating to the 1920s. Individual buildings have been restored by their owners at various times, and business owners in the district have cooperated to encourage historic preservation. On July 30, 1976, the courthouse square and surrounding lots were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in recognition of the district's well- preserved Victorian frontier architecture. According to its nomination form, the district retains \\"the charm of the Northwest Texas Frontier\\".

History  King Ferdinand III of Castille, in 1248, during the conquest of Seville, with some of his men-at-arms, assaulted and took a tower. Seemingly, with such boldness and bravery they gained the admiration of the King. On 28 August 1632, on the initiative of Philip IV, a special corps of troops was ordered to be formed with veteran soldiers, reenlistments and knights of noble ancestry - men so skilled that they only took arms when the monarch assumed command in person, designating it \\"King's Guard Colonelship.\\" Its organization commenced in Almansa in 1634, its force fixed at fifteen companies with 90 harquebusiers, 40 musketeers, and 60 corslets and pikemen each. Later, in 1638, it was augmented to twenty. Its first colonel, Count Duke of Olivares, Don Gaspar de Guzm√°n, whose post was the recently created \\"King's Guard Colonelship,\\" was in command of very distinguished soldiers of great renown. In 1640, Philip IV elevated it to the category of King's Guard Regiment and in 1664 to Castile Tercio. From 1701 to 1710 it was dedicated to its ancient mission, guarding the Monarch, and it was in 1707 when it received the designation Castile, and in 1710 that of Castile Immemorial Infantry Regiment. It gained glory in the Spanish War of Succession and the Italian Campaigns (1718-1749), eventually it received the name King's Infantry Regiment on 7 January 1766. That same year, King Charles III, persuaded by the antiquity of the regiment, declared it the King's Immemorial. After diverse historical changes in losing and receiving its name, it received its present designation in 1995.  Connections with royal family  Traditionally, as the regiment is linked to the Spanish royal family and to the sovereign in his/her duty as Captain General and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, all the Princes of Asturias since 1862 are enrolled as Honorary soldiers in the 1st Company. Following the tradition then Don Felipe de Borb√≥n y Grecia (Prince of Asturias and heir to the Crown) assumed his post as a soldier in 1977.  Traditional dress uniform  To commemorate Spain's long military tradition, in 1981 King Juan Carlos I accepted the proposal of the Chief of Staff of the Army to establish two companies with historic uniforms and armaments, which could render honors and participate in special ceremonies. The period chosen was that from 1780 to 1786, at the end of the reign of Charles III. At this date Spanish infantry regiment had two battalions, each one formed of nine companies; one of grenadiers and eight of fusiliers. The description in detail of the uniform is as follows: Fusilier uniforms The first honor guard company wears a white uniform, with the green emblem, that of the King, by special grace it was dressed elegantly in the colors of the Royal Household troops, and as a special grace they wore botoneras on the vest and dress coat. The second company wears a blue uniform with a similar emblem. Grenadier uniform Grenadiers in the modern Infantry Regiment \\"Inmemorial del Rey\\" No. 1 are not permitted to wear glasses, but beards have recently been permitted. Historically selection for the grenadier companies of the Spanish infantry was a distinction normally reserved for the bravest and tallest soldiers of a regiment. These picked men marched at the head of the regiment, escorted the colors and were expected to form the vanguard when storming a fortified position. They wore short sabers, a distinction retained in the modern regiment. The high grenadier cap still worn, augmented their stature and the brass burners on the strap of the cartridge pouch and the worn on their cuffs distinguished these elite companies. The uniform is worn by staff personnel and the marker unit (). Early 20th century full dress In addition to the 18th century uniforms previously described, the Infantry Regiment \\"Inmemorial del Rey\\" No. 1 parades detachments of up to company strength, plus the regimental band, in the full dress uniform of the Spanish line infantry, as worn during the reign of King Alfonso XIII (1902-1931). This consists of the distinctive \\"ros\\" (shako), dark blue tunics with red facings and red trousers. Current functions At present the regiment is the unit responsible for providing the central seat of army headquarters' security, services, and support needed for its functioning, and it also helps give security to whatever the authorities task it with. These functions support the central objective of facilitating the operation of the different centers and departments that make up headquarters, to which end it performs following tasks: * Giving security to the people as well as to the installations of headquarters. * Organising and directing services necessary to guarantee the optimal functioning of material resources in the service of Buenavista Palace, and the supply of the centers into which it is integrated. In this way also it also guarantees, through its transport assets, the mobility of the authorities and the board of headquarters. * Rendering prescribed honors within the garrison of Madrid and as an exception in other garrisons. This function, perhaps the best known by the public in general, gives pomp and colour to various social functions. This function entails, in broad outline, the reception of heads of state and other civil and military authorities and the participation in cultural, social and religious functions of great relevance in Madrid and elsewhere. Organisation and insignia In order to execute the above functions, the regiment is organized into the following units, plus command staff: *40px \\"Old Guard of Castille\\" Honor Guard Battalion, charged with guard of honor duties and other ceremonial and public duties, with two companies of infantry, a section of artillery with six 105/14 howitzers, and a corps of drums wearing uniforms and playing period instruments of the 1780s alongside modern day plain bugles. *40px Automobile unit with 274 vehicles. *30px Support unit with two companies, one of security which gives security to the installations as well as to the personnel of army headquarters and to the centers and institutions located in Buenavista Palace and the other company of staff and support where army personnel who execute functions of administrative support to the centers and institutions of army headquarters are assigned. The Service unit composed of a company and two Units, one of installations support and the other of personnel support. The service company gives mechanical support to Buenavista Palace whereas the units keep watch over the proper functioning of the installations and the well-being of personnel posted at army headquarters. *30px The regimental band is composed of 65 members. It is well known throughout Spain for the quality of its concerts. The band wears the blue and red infantry regulation full dress uniform adopted in 1908. It is one of the oldest musical units in the Spanish Army. The regiment's band is integrated into its support unit and is based in the Buenavista Palace. Alongside the regimental band is the Corps of Drums (Banda de Guerra), made up of bugles and drums plus a section of bagpipes and fifes. The band has played extensively in Europe and the Americas and has had numerous recordings made in Spain and France. It has also performed with the National Orchestra of Spain. Along with the Musical Unit of the Spanish Royal Guard, it plays to honor heads of government during state visits to Spain. https://www.defensa.gob.es/portaldecultura/cultural/musica/madrid/musica_178.htmlWhile the bandsmen are part of the Common Band Corps and graduates of the Central Defense Academy, the separate Corps of Drums consists of serving personnel of the regiment. Civilian aid In addition to these regular functions, the regiment has participated in actions on behalf of the civilian population when required, e.g. environmental cleaning carried out in Galicia following the sinking of the ship \\"Prestige\\".

In 1889 a wood frame building was built, and the 1872 building was again used as the jail. In 1895 the city of Olivia won a battle to become the county seat, and court business was held in a local business building. A court decision returned the county seat to Beaver Falls for two years, but then Olivia finally won the county seat permanently in 1900. Architect Fremont D. Orff from Minneapolis designed the building, which was built at a cost of $88,000. The building has influences from a few different architectural styles. The corner pavilions and the central tower have segmented blue-green copper domes, suggesting Second Empire architecture. The center pavilion has a porch with balusters, fluted columns, and an oculus-pierced pediment, which reflects Georgian architecture.

Qingshui, known locally as Zushi-Gong (), is the principal god worshiped at Zushi Temple. History Zushi Temple was first built during the Qing Dynasty in 1767 by Hokkien immigrants from Anxi County, Quanzhou Municipality, Fujian Province in China. It has been reconstructed three times. Its last reconstruction, started in 1947, is best known for being the masterpiece of renowned Taiwanese artist, Li Meishu. Festivals Every sixth day of the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar on Zushi-Gong's birthday, Zushi Temple holds a Pigs of God (Á•ûË±¨) Contest. Farmers compete to raise the fattest pig, which during the competition day, the pig is decorated with ornaments. The fattest pig is then sacrificed to Zushi-Gong. In the past few years, this tradition has been met with disapproval by animal rights activists. While the majority of temples that practice this rite have started using symbolic pigs, Zushi Temple in Sanxia still continues the tradition of using a live pig. Architecture Unique among temples, all of the walls and columns of Zushi Temple are sculpted from stone. The details are also carved with a wide variety of styles from ancient to modern, or even western- influenced, due to the western art education of Li Meishu. Transportation The temple is accessible south of Yingge Station of Taiwan Railways.

It was directed by Grigori Chukhrai and starred Izolda Izvitskaya and Oleg Strizhenov. The film is set during the Russian Civil War and tells the story of a tragic romance between a female sniper of the Red Army and an officer of the White Army. Plot In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, a small force of Red Army soldiers that survived a crushing defeat by the Whites is forced to flee into the Karakum Desert. Among them is female sniper Maria, who has already claimed thirty-eight enemies dead. When the unit ambushes a camel caravan transporting White soldiers, she kills two of them and tries to shoot their officer, who will be her forty-first, but misses. The man, a lieutenant named Govorukha-Otrok, is carrying a letter from Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak to General Anton Denikin that states he has secret information to be conveyed orally to General Dratsekno. Maria is entrusted with guarding him. Tensions arise between the two: the officer is a well-educated aristocrat who is both amused and impressed by the crude attempts of Maria, a fisherman's orphan daughter, to compose Agitprop poetry. When their camels are stolen, their commander decides to send his captive on a boat to their headquarters in Kazalinsk via the Aral Sea. The vessel capsizes in a sudden storm, and only Maria and Otrok remain alive, stranded on an isolated island. The Red soldier treats the White officer when he catches a fever and is slowly charmed by his manners, while he is overcome with gratitude and begins to call her 'Man Friday' with affection. When she demands to know what he means, he tells her the story about Robinson Crusoe. The two fall in love and seem to forget about the war. When a boat approaches their isle, they first think these are fishermen and run toward them. Otrok recognizes them as White soldiers and intends to join them. Maria shoots him in the back, killing him. As she realizes he is dead, she runs into the sea and embraces his corpse.

The picture was Grigori Chukhrai's directorial debut. The Mosfilm directorate was reluctant to authorize Koltunov's script, as the portrayal of a love story between Red and White soldiers was deemed inappropriate: the script had to be revised six times. However, Chukhrai had the support of the eminent directors Ivan Pyryev and Mikhail Romm. When the screenplay was discussed in the directorate on 19 April 1955 and several of those present raised the issue, Romm said: \\"very well! Let every girl fall in love with the enemy and then kill him.\\" After that, it was approved for filming.Muskyi, Igor (2007). Sto velikikh otechestvennykh kinofilmov. Veche. . p. 119.

Together with the International Satellite Communications System (ISCS), SADIS forms a global distribution system for meteorological information to all member states. SADIS forms part of the ICAO Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS).  History  In Montreal, 1982, the world area forecast system (WAFS) was established by the ICAO Communications/Meteorology to aid in the supply of meteorological information to authorities and users. It was decided that in the final phase of WAFS, the products should be distributed globally by satellite broadcast. Two WAFCs (World Area Forecast Centre) were created, one in Washington, and the other in Bracknell, UK. Because of limitations in forecasting techniques and telecommunication systems, the project had to be implemented in two phases. Initially, there would, apart from the two WAFCs, be regional area forecast centres (RAFCs). In the final phase the RAFCs would be closed. Satellite distribution was a prerequisite for closing the RAFCs. It was decided that three INTELSAT satellites would be used. Two will be provided by the United States for the distribution of WAFC Washington products over the Americas, Pacific and Eastern Asia. The other was provided by the UK, and became known as SADIS. The first two-way SADIS terminal was installed at the South African Weather Bureau in Pretoria. A conference attended by a delegation of Met Specialists from all over the world were held at the Kruger National Park. A demonstration of the efficiency of satellite communications was held at the Kruger National Park. MMS installed a SADIS terminal in the Park to display the reception of data from Bracknell. The software for the installation in Pretoria was provided by NetSys International. NetSys also hosted the conference in the Kruger National Park.  Satellites  The Indian Ocean INTELSAT 604 at 60E is used to cover the ICAO AFI and MID Regions and in the ASIA and EUR Regions as far eastwards as 140E. The uplink is at Whitehill, Oxfordshire, UK.

Professional career Kramer was drafted by the Utah Jazz in the 3rd round (1st pick, 45th overall) of the 1979 NBA draft in his senior year. After the draft, the Jazz made a 2-for-1 trade involving Bernard King, which left no room for Kramer on their roster, so they waived him. He played about a half season in the CBA before being signed to a 10-day contract by the Denver Nuggets on February 28, 1980. He was good enough to later get signed for the remainder of the season.https://www.basketball- reference.com/players/k/kramear01.html He only played eight games with the Nuggets in 1979‚Äì80.

This portion of Main Street was once designated United States Route 20, which now runs along a bypass just south of the downtown. Marlborough was incorporated in 1660, and was a key stop on the main road between Boston and Springfield until the 20th century. Its original town center was north of Main Street between Prospect and Rawlins, where the district's oldest resources, the 1706 Old Common Cemetery, is located. The present business district arose in the 19th century with the advent of industrialization, growing along Main Street between that point and another small village at the junction with Bolton Street, a major north-south route in the area. Most of the commercial buildings in the district are made of brick and stone, and were built in the late 19th or early 20th century. City Hall is a well-kept Beaux Arts building designed by Allen, Collens & Berry, and built in 1905. Allen and Collens also designed the First National Bank building at 200 Main Street. There are four churches, and several stylish Queen Anne Victorian houses, notably that of Judge James MacDonald at 23 Prospect Street. It includes two previously-listed buildings: the Warren Block at 155 Main Street and the Temple Building at 149 Main.

It is a cohesive collection of 8 residences and one school building that are representative of upper class housing on large well-proportioned lots. The oldest house in the district was built c. 1865, the newest c. 1924. A number of 19th century houses were restyled during the 1920s. The Immaculate Conception School was built in 1961, and does not contribute to the area's historic significance. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The Pleasant Street area was developed as an upper- class residential area for leaders in Marlborough's dominant shoe manufacturing industry. Members of the Howe and Frye families contributed several of the houses. Louis Howe, who began manufacturing shoes in 1850, built a substantial Second Empire house at 207 Pleasant c. 1865, which was updated to the Colonial Revival by his nephew in the 1920s. Louis Howe's cousin Franklin built 207 Pleasant c. 1872; it was a companion Second Empire house, which was given Georgian Revival styling in 1927 by John Frye, who grew up next door. Three other houses were built in the 19th century, all with Queen Anne styling. The Russell House at 208 Pleasant was built c. 1885, and has a wraparound porch and bargeboard decoration in its gables. This house, like several of the others in the district, has been converted to multi-unit housing. The Walter Frye House at 187 Pleasant was built c. 1895, and has characteristic Queen Anne features, with numerous projections and gables, as well as a wraparound porch with octagonal pavilion and porte cochere. The Frye-Hazelton House at 223 Pleasant was also built c. 1895, and features a prominent octagonal tower.

It is a partnership organisation, led by Imperial College London, and includes leading museums, universities, environmental organisations, and Government agencies across the UK. It develops activities and resources, including seven national nature surveys, which allow people to get closer to their local environment while collecting important scientific data. It also arranges and take part in nature events and workshops around the country. It is largely funded by the Big Lottery Fund and began in 2007, operating across England. Since January 2014, it has begun expanding into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland thanks to a further grant.  Soil and earthworm survey  The OPAL soil and earthworm survey was launched in March 2009 by the OPAL Soil Centre at Imperial College London, supported by a number of celebrities including Steve Leonard and Chris Packham. The survey aims to learn more about soil and earthworm distribution in England and the effects that humans are having on soil quality. Members of the public are asked to upload their findings directly onto the OPAL website, and results are then analysed by Imperial College London, which is also coordinating the survey.  Air survey  The OPAL air survey launched in September 2009 and is coordinated by Imperial College London. The survey asks people to look for lichens on trees and tar spot fungus on sycamore leaves and then record their results online. The survey is helping scientists learn more about the effects of air pollution, and is supported by a number of organisations including the British Lichen Society.  Water survey  The OPAL water survey launched in May 2010 and is coordinated by University College London (UCL). The survey asks people to go pond-dipping and identify the invertebrates living in their local pond or lake. Using this information they can then find out how polluted the water is, as some creatures are more tolerant of pollution than others. Results are collected online and will help scientists learn more about lakes and ponds across England.  Biodiversity survey  The OPAL biodiversity survey launched in September 2010, coordinated by the Open University (OU). The survey asks the public to investigate their hedges and look for invertebrates and other signs of wildlife. Hedges are incredibly important habitats for many creatures and the survey aims to raise awareness and learn more about life in hedges across the country.  Climate survey  The OPAL climate survey launched in March 2011, coordinated by the Met Office. It asked people to look for contrails in the sky, estimate their thermal comfort, and measure wind using bubbles. The results are helping scientists learn more about the ways we affect our climate, and how we may adapt to it. Results submissions for this survey closed on 31 March 2014.  Bugs Count  The Bugs Count survey launched in June 2011 and was led by the Natural History Museum. It aims to collect data on bugs and other invertebrates that live all around us by asking the public to count invertebrates in timed challenges and look out for six particular bugs in the Species Quest. The Natural History Museum also developed the free Bugs Count app for iPhone and Android.  Tree health survey  The OPAL tree health survey launched in May 2013 in partnership with Forest Research and the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA). It aims to build a picture of the health of trees across country by asking the public to record data about the size and appearance of their tree while also looking for signs of pests and diseases. This includes six serious pests and diseases, referred to as the Most Unwanted, which are not yet established in the UK and could cause serious damage to the tree population. This survey has also been extended to Wales and Scotland in partnership with Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Government. The Food and Environment Agency also developed the free tree health survey app for iPhone and Android.  Community Environment Report  In January 2013, OPAL published the Community Environment Report, summarising the findings of the first five years of the project and its contribution to citizen science. The report showed that more than half a million people across England had been involved in OPAL activities, many of whom were carrying out a nature survey for the very first time. Their data had also provided scientists with information about locations that had not been sampled before and may not otherwise have been studied.  UK-wide expansion  In August 2013, the Big Lottery Fund confirmed a further funding grant to OPAL enabling it to expand into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with a new team of partners between 2014 and 2016.

The company was established in 1917, and opened the suburban √òstensj√∏ Line tramway in 1926; it took over the majority ownership of Holmenkolbanen in 1933, that owned the Holmenkoll Line, Sognsvann Line and the R√∏a Line. Akersbanerne merged with Oslo Sporveier in 1949, following the merger of the municipalities. History Nationaltheatret was the terminus for three of the Akersbanerne lines. The company was founded on 7 June 1917 to coordinate the construction of new suburban tramways from Kristiania (now Oslo) to the new suburbs in Aker. The company planned to build several lines from the end of the street tramways in the city, and extend them on grade-separated right-of-way. The first project was the √òstensj√∏ Line; with construction starting in 1922 it opened from V√•lerenga to Bryn on 18 December 1923 and to Oppsal on 10 January 1926. For the first three years street trams operated by Kristiania Sporveisselskab went the 1.5 km route to Bryn, but after the full line opened, Akersbanerne could never reach agreement with Oslo Sporveier, and not until 1937 did they run trams into the city center. Also in 1922 the company started building the Sognsvann Line, and in 1924 it bought the Smestad Line from A/S Holmenkolbanen. In 1928 the Sognsvann Line and the Holmenkoll Line were extended from Majorstuen to Nationaltheatret, but the builder A/S Holmenkolbanen had acquired so much debt in the process that they on 16 November 1933 were forced to save the company by merging the Sognsvann and Smestad Line into Akersbanerne‚Äîgiving the latter a majority ownership stake in the former. From 4 January 1937 B√¶rumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the √òstensj√∏ Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne. On 1 January 1948 the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949 the two municipal owned companies merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier.

Jones (born January 14, 1960) is an American former professional baseball shortstop. He played for the New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, and Kansas City Royals of the Major League Baseball (MLB). Amateur career A native of Miami, Florida, Jones attended Hialeah High School and played college baseball at the University of Miami. In 1979, Jones played collegiate summer baseball for the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). Batting .413, he was named the league's outstanding pro prospect, and led the Mets to the league title. Jones was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2006. Professional career Jones was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers ninth overall in the 1980 MLB draft. After four seasons in the Dodgers' farm system, Jones was traded with Sid Fernandez to the New York Mets for Bob Bailor and Carlos Diaz. He made the team out of spring training , but saw only limited action behind Jose Oquendo and Ron Gardenhire at short, and was used primarily as a pinch hitter or pinch runner. In thirteen plate appearances, he had a double and three walks. The double was a game winning walk-off hit against Al Holland and the Philadelphia Phillies on April 28. On May 13, in one of his few appearances on the field with the Mets, Jones committed an error that led to three unearned runs in the Mets 5-3 loss to the Dodgers. He was reassigned to their triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides shortly afterwards, and briefly reappeared with the Mets following the All-Star break. Jones split between Tidewater and the double A Jackson Mets, and batted only .192 combined. Following the 1985 season, he was released, and signed with the Seattle Mariners. Jones played at three levels for the Mariners in , one of which was the major leagues. Despite batting .290 in the minors, with Seattle, he had only one hit in 21 at-bats for a .095 batting average. Batting .319 with the Pacific Coast League's Calgary Cannons in , Jones was traded to the Kansas City Royals for a player to be named later. He continued to hit well for the Omaha Royals, and earned a promotion to Kansas City. In 39 games, Jones batted .254, and had ten of his eleven career RBIs. Following the season, Jones signed with the Oakland Athletics, but after committing four errors in three games with the triple A Tacoma Tigers, and getting only two hits in eighteen at bats, he was released. He signed with the New York Yankees shortly afterwards, spending the rest of the season with their triple A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers, before retiring.

It is part of five-hospital Baptist Health, also in Jacksonville, Florida. Overview In 2016, U.S. News & World Report named Wolfson Children's Hospital among the nation's top 50 hospitals for neurology and neurosurgery, and gastroenterology and GI surgery. Wolfson Children's Hospital achieved Magnet status by the American Nurses Credentialing Center in 2007 and again in 2012 and 2017, an international recognition of excellence in patient care. A not-for-profit children's hospital that serves 157,000+ patients from birth to 21 years of age annually, Wolfson Children's Hospital offers 30+ pediatric medical and surgical specialities through its long-time partnerships with Nemours Children's Specialty Care (of the Nemours Foundation), Jacksonville, the University of Florida College of Medicine-Jacksonville, and Mayo Clinic Florida in Jacksonville. A new inpatient building under construction as of 2020 will increase the hospital's number of beds to 298.https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/city-issues-permit-for- dollar145-million-wolfson-childrens-hospital-critical-care-tower History In 1946, Morris David Wolfson wrote a letter to his sons, Sam Wolfson, Louis Wolfson, Saul Wolfson, Cecil Wolfson, and Nathan Wolfson asking them to build a children's facility in Jacksonville, Florida. A $500,000 donation from the Wolfson Family Foundation led to the establishment of Wolfson Children's Memorial Hospital, a 50-bed pediatric wing at Baptist Memorial Hospital (now Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville) in 1955. The hospital grew incrementally during its early years, particularly in 1971, when pediatricians with the Northeast Florida Pediatric Society signed an agreement stating that a consolidated center of excellence would be the best way to serve the region's children and families. In 1987, Wolfson and Nemours Children's Specialty Care, Jacksonville, began their affiliation to better serve the area's children. Wolfson also began an academic affiliation with the University of Florida College of Medicine ‚Äì Jacksonville in the 1990s, training pediatric residents, fellows and other professionals in pediatric medicine. In 2019, they began training anesthesia residents from Kendall Regional Medical Center. It is also serves as a pediatrics training site for physicians in the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. In 1993, a new Wolfson Children's Hospital opened, offering a range of inpatient and outpatient services, including a level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; Children's Emergency Center; and specialized programs such as pediatric oncology, radiology, pathology and research. Since 2011, the hospital has also expanded regionally, opening Wolfson Children's Specialty Centers in Lake City, Florida; Daytona Beach, Florida; Brunswick, Georgia (in partnership with Southeast Georgia Health System); at the Baptist Clay Medical Campus in Fleming Island, Florida; and in Tallahassee, Florida (in partnership with Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare). In 2012, Wolfson Children's Hospital expanded with the opening of the new J. Wayne and Delores Barr Weaver Tower on the Baptist Medical Center Jacksonville campus. The hospital continues to expand its number of specialized services, and to provide child health advocacy outside of hospital walls through THE PLAYERS Center for Child Health, which offers education, childhood injury prevention, and legislative efforts to improve health care access for children. Foundation In 1985, the Baptist Health Foundation was created to assist in fundraising for Baptist Health. The Foundation coordinates gifts and fundraising for Wolfson Children's Hospital in addition to four adult Baptist Health hospitals. The hospital's major fundraising event is the Wolfson Children‚Äôs Challenge, an annual event that features a 55K Ultra Marathon, 55K Ultra Relay, 30K Individual Run, 1-Mile Fun Run, and family- friendly activities. Another signature event is Christmas in July, always held on July 25 each year, to collect toys and donations to help the hospital's Child Life Department normalize the hospital experience and provide distraction through toy and play.

In 1893, Norwich introduced Unguentine to the medical profession as the first antiseptic surgical dressing. The company‚Äôs mixture called Cholera Infantum, later renamed Pepto-Bismol, appeared for the first time in 1901. Its principal use was for infants with severe diarrhea. In 1907, Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) tablets were added to the company‚Äôs product line. In 1939, Norwich Pharmaceutical stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During World War II, the company earned the Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Award with four added stars in recognition of its support of the troops and war effort. In 1982, the company, then called Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Procter & Gamble Company. In the mid-1990s, Norwich constructed an Intermediate Potency solid dose form facility, from which the osteoporosis drug Actonel was launched. In 2001, the North Norwich plant was purchased from Procter & Gamble by Outsourcing Services Group, who revived the original Norwich Pharmaceuticals name by placing it on the sign in front of the plant. Outsourcing Services Group was later purchased by private equity firm AFI Partners, who continued using the original name. In 2013, the company was rebranded Norwich Pharma Services, and it continues to manufacture medications for large companies, including onetime owner Procter & Gamble, under licensing agreements.

Included in the district are a main house built c. 1760, a barn complex with buildings dating from the 19th and 20th centuries, a modern greenhouse, and farm fields lined by stone walls. It is historically significant for its well-preserved buildings, and for its later transformation into a summer estate. It is also one of the town's few remaining working farms. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Wellington Farm is set on in rural-residential southern Weston. The property is roughly bisected by Wellesley Street, just south of the Massachusetts Turnpike, and is roughly bounded on the south by Glen Road. Open fields line the road, with two separate farmstead complexes on either side. The one to the east has a farmhouse built about 1760, with later modifications around 1800 and 1900, while that on the west side has an early 20th-century house with more modern outbuildings for the farm operations. Part of this property was first recorded in 1770, when the house on the east side was already standing. By the turn of the 20th century, it had grown to over , and extended as far west as Winter Street. The property was operated as a farm until the end of the 19th century, at which time it was turned into a summer estate. It was acquired by Arthur Wight Wellington, president of U.S. Leather, in 1907, and remains in that family.

Located at the junction of United States Route 20 and Cochituate Road (Massachusetts Route 27), it includes fifteen well-preserved 19th-century buildings that form one of the best-preserved village centers of that period near Boston. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The town of Wayland was settled in the 17th century as part of Sudbury, and was incorporated as East Sudbury in 1780, and renamed Wayland in 1835. The present village center took shape beginning in 1814-15, when after much controversy, it was chosen as the site of the new town meetinghouse, replacing the town's 1726 meetinghouse. That new building still stands today, forming the visual centerpiece of the center at the southeast corner of the junction of Routes 20 and 27. Material from the 1726 building was recycled for construction of a new town hall, which was converted into a residence in 1888. Both of these buildings are fine Federal period structures; the church bell was provided by the firm of Paul Revere. The present town hall, located across the street from the 1815 one, is a Georgian Revival building constructed in 1957 on the site of the 1887 town hall; it is the only 20th-century structure in the district. The historic district is centered at the junction of Routes 20 and 27, and extends north and south along Route 27 (Cochituate Road). It includes sixteen buildings, which are a mix of residential and civic buildings, and include two 19th-century barns. Most of these buildings are one or two stories in height, and of wood-frame construction; the current town hall is the only non-wood building. Most of them were built before 1850, and are either Federal or Greek Revival in style. The most notable exceptions are the 1881 train station, which helped transform Wayland into a commuter suburb of Boston, and the 1897 former post office building, which is Colonial Revival in style.

On 13 June 1996, flight 865 crashed on its takeoff from Fukuoka Airport Runway 16. Three of 275 suffered fatal injuries in the accident.  Accident  Flight 865 was cleared for takeoff from Runway 16. Suddenly, the crew of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 attempted to abort take-off after the failure of the number 3 (right) engine. The abort occurred at speeds nearing V2, and after rotation of the nose. Following the abort, attempts were made to stop the aircraft on the runway by use of brakes, ground spoilers and thrust reversers, but the crew was unable to stop the aircraft within the boundaries of the runway, which exited the airport property. The captain stated that he feared that the aircraft might hit buildings or objects if he did not abort the takeoff.\\"Garuda pilot details Fukuoka crash\\" (Archive). The Japan Times. 21 February 1997. Retrieved on 21 November 2014. In slowing down, the aircraft slid through a ditch, a fence and a road before finally coming to rest approximately beyond the runway threshold. Damage done to the aircraft during the slide across the ground caused the landing gear to break off and both wing-mounted engines to be torn from the wings. The fuselage broke in two places, at about the wing root trailing edge, and at approximately aft of the wing root trailing edge. The resultant fire destroyed the areas between the hull fractures, and other areas of the aircraft. Three passengers died as a result. The final report concluded that pilot error and the failure of the maintenance and flight operation sections of the airline in properly coordinating matters resulted in the accident.\\"Garuda crash blamed on pilot misjudgment\\" (Archive). The Japan Times. 20 November 1997. Retrieved on 21 November 2014. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, registration PK-GIE. It had its first flight on 24 April 1979 and was delivered to Garuda Indonesia on 27 July 1979. The aircraft was 17 years old at the time of the accident, it was the 284th DC-10 built and its MSN number was 46685.  Engine details  The aircraft had three General Electric CF6-50C2 turbofan engines. The cause of the engine failure leading to the crash was that the engine turbine blades had been in service for 6,182 cycles (take-offs and landings) when General Electric said to discard blades after 6,000 cycles.

This caused a controversy, with demonstrations from the Kashmir valley against the land transfer and protests from the Jammu region supporting it. The largest demonstration saw more than 500,000 protesters at a single rally, among the largest in Kashmir's history. Kashmir protests Six people were killed and 100 injured when police fired into a crowd in Srinagar protesting the transfer of forest land. Separatist JKLF (R) organised a march to the controversial land in Baltal. Senior separatist leaders Shabir Ahmad Shah, Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), which planned the protests, were placed under house arrest. Throughout the Srinagar area, most public buildings, including schools and government offices, and many businesses, have remained closed. Environmental concerns Initial opposition to the land transfer was based on environmental concerns. Some environmentalists argued that the land transfer would hamper the region's delicate ecological balance. Reports that the SASB was planning to construct dams across the river Indus to generate electricity for the shrine were unconfirmed. Government response The state government accepted the demands of the protesters from the Kashmir valley region by revoking the land transfer decision on 1 July 2008. Hindu groups in the Jammu region reacted by mounting their own counter-protests against the revocation and called for the cancellation of the revocation decision. Political turmoil As the Kashmiri protests grew wider and more violent, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) said that it would withdraw support to the Indian National Congress (INC)-led state government if it did not revoke the land transfer agreement. Though the land transfer was revoked (after the PDP withdrew its support), the crisis deepened further when the PDP did not lend support to the state government even after the revocation. Meanwhile, the Gulam Nabi Azad's minority government decided to step-down on 7 July 2008. The protests, however, took a more political tone as state elections are scheduled to be held later in 2008.Protests over Hindu lands escalate in Kashmir. Reuters. 2008-06-26. With elections already due in the state, Omar Abdullah played down the incident and said that PDP's decision to withdraw was not a major constitutional crisis.CNN-IBN Times Now Jammu protests In Jammu, mass protests erupted against the government's decision to revoke the land transfer. The people of the Jammu region generally supported the land transfer, and threatened to shut down the city on 26 June 2008. 20 kilometres away, in Nagrota, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters blocked a highway It has been joined by 35 other organisations, under the banner of Amarnath Shrine Sangharsh Samiti, that have two main demands: that of recalling Governor NN Vohra and the restoration of land to the Shrine Board. Hindu groups such as the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) protested in front of Kashmir House in Delhi in support of the land transfer. The situation in Jammu suddenly deteriorated after Kuldeep Raj committed suicide on 23 July and his body was mishandled and dishonoured by the police. Slowly, protests spread to other parts of Jammu. A curfew was imposed in many districts. Protesters claimed that an economic blockade of the Kashmir Valley was being imposed by stopping traffic on the Srinagar Jammu National Highway. The \\"economic blockade\\" theory was however fiercely contested, with the Government of India, the Army, the District Administration, SASB maintaining that there was no blockade. BJP called the blockade \\"a lie perpetuated by the ISI\\", of which there was no compelling evidence, and maintained the people of the Valley were being misled with a false propaganda, aiding the designs of separatists. One person was killed and another injured on 6 August 2008 when the Army fired to disperse a violent mob, which blocked the Jammu-Pathankot Highway in Kathua district. Two protesters were killed and eight injured as police opened fire to quell a mob in Samba district on 1 August 2008 Conversely there were also Muslims who, backed by the local Muslim federation and the Muslim Gujjar community, who supported the demands of the Hindus of Jammu. There were, however, reports of Hindu rioters in Jammu attacking and burning at least 72 Muslim homes during the weeks of violent protests. Shri Amarnath Yatra Sangharsh Samiti convener Leela Karan Sharma said on 6 August 2008 that nothing short of revocation of the land transfer to Amarnath Shrine Board would be acceptable. He opined that the state government was responsible for flaring religious sentiments by allowing construction of the Muslim Jama Masjid at Baltal, yet not allowing a temporary structure for the benefit of Hindu yatris. Government response Despite the protests, the state government has not annulled the revocation decision. Central Government moved hundreds of security forces into the region. Indian authorities restored the Amarnath pilgrimage route after a brief disruption.Amarnath yatra resumes from Jammu. The Economic Times. 2008-06-26. Opposition party BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said on 2 August 2008 that \\"It seems the Centre only understands the voices of the valley and not of the Jammu region. It is trying to find a solution through force and is not initiating a dialogue\\". The prime minister Manmohan Singh spoke to BJP president Rajnath Singh and sought his party's help in finding a solution to the issue. Regional biases The protests highlighted the eclipse of secularism in the state of Jammu and Kashmir It also highlighted widespread frustration among both Hindus and Muslims in Jammu with the appeasement of separatists in the Kashmir valley. The separatist-Muslim dominated north west (Kashmir valley), not ready to provide land for Amarnath yatris, succeeded in revoking the land transfer through violent protests. Jammu's Hindu and Muslim nationalists in the south west (Jammu) are equally opposed to the appeasement decision to revoke the land transfer. Thus, a regional divide emerged between Jammu and Kashmir., while eastern Ladakh remains aloof. The Gujjar Muslim community strongly attacked the statement of separatist leaders that Muslims in Jammu do not want to live with Hindus of the region. They described it as \\"an attempt to drive a wedge between communities bonded with each other by language and culture for centuries\\".https://www.indianexpress.com Fruit grower's protests Kashmir Fruit Growers Association gave a 24-hour ultimatum to the government failing which they would start agitation for the opening of Muzaffarabad Road for export. \\"We will export our products to various Indian states via Muzaffarabad and Wagah border\\", said president of the association. The Indian government alleges that the claims of an economic blockade were fabricated by the Hurriyat and the Inter-Services Intelligence to provoke locals into joining the pro-independence protests. The Ex-Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil, appealed to the fruit growers to call off their protests. He offered to buy all their fruit and also to pay compensation to those whose fruit has perished. Party wise stand Congress Working Committee spokesperson, Veerappa Moily, said \\"Providing makeshift and temporary accommodation for yatris and pilgrims all over the country is not a new phenomenon... the authorities spend a lot of money in providing temporary facilities during Kumbh Mela, Puri rath yatra festival\\". said that it was absurd to suggest all such temporary shelters could be made permanent. Moily said that the Hurriyat factions and other separatist groups had exploited the mood during the turmoil to revive their \\"diabolic agenda\\". He said that playing mischief, Hurriyat had spread rumours that the highways from the Valley to the plains had been blocked stopping movement of goods and essential commodities. Making use of this false propaganda, they organised the march to Muzaffarabad to seek market for the fruit, Moily said. Ignoring the Indian government's curfew orders, People's Democratic Party and Kashmiri separatist leaders. backed the local fruit growers Government position Claiming that there is no blockade along the Srinagar-Jammu highway, the ministry said as many as 236 trucks and tankers carrying oil, gas, sheep, medicines and poultry products crossed the Jawahar Tunnel from the Jammu side early on Wednesday morning. Of these, 82 trucks and tankers had reached Srinagar by afternoon, it said. Referring to the stranded trucks in the Valley, an official said a fleet of them actually belonged to one individual close to the Hurriyat. The transporter refused to move his vehicles towards Jammu despite the promise of full security cover along the route. The Kashmiri media, however, reported shortages of food, drugs, and other essential supplies in the Kashmir Valley as a result of the alleged blockade and consequently prices of essential commodities increased substantially in the Valley. March to the LOC On 11 August 2008, 50,000 to 2,50,000 Kashmiri protesters attempted to cross the LoC to Muzaffarabad, in violation of march ban orders. Despite intelligence warnings that the LoC march would gather tens of thousands of supporters, the State government and top police officials failed to act immediately and refused to impose a curfew. In the event, small groups of police personnel were left to hold back the marchers. 11 August violence Fifteen people were killed and hundreds more injured when police and paramilitary forces opened fire on protesters attempting to cross the LoC. All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz, a moderate separatist, was among those killed on 11 August. Police say several of their personnel were injured by stones thrown by those at the protest.  12 August violence  Following the death of the APHC separatist leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz and others during the police firing on 11 August, the separatists in Kashmir region organized protests. Fifteen Kashmiri civilians were killed in the firing by Kashmir police and paramilitary forces. More than 100 people were also injured in a twelve separate incidents of police firing across the Kashmir valley region.Kashmir turmoil. Daily News, Bahrain. Six protesters were killed in Srinagar police firing. In Lasjan, on the outskirts of Srinagar, four were killed after police forces opened fire on a protest led by former government minister Javed Mustafa Mir. Police sources claim that the service weapon of one of Mir's personal security guards \\"accidentally\\" went off, injuring 7 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers, and provoking the retaliatory firing that left four protesters dead. However, local villagers claimed that the CRPF forces opened fire on the protesters first, killing two, then opening once more when others went to help the injured, killing two women in the process. Three protesters, including a woman, were killed in firing at Paribal by the Indian Army. The army spokesperson for the 15 Corps said that the protesters were throwing stones at a military picket, and refused to disperse despite repeated appeals. Another protester was reportedly killed in Anantnag. In Kishawar, communal clashes broke out after Kashmiri Muslims began protesting the death of Sheikh Abdul Aziz. Muslim and Hindu owned homes and businesses were torched, and two protesters, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed in the rioting. The burial of Sheikh Aziz, held in the Martyrs Graveyard in Srinagar, passed without incident. 14 August Jammu death In Jammu, a man named Balwant Raj Sharma poisoned himself. He donated all his property to Shree Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti. 20 August protests in Jammu and Kashmir The peaceful demonstrations in this otherwise bustling Jammu city was in stark contrast to the high decibel protests in Srinagar. While in Jammu, women walked silently with candles in their hands demanding restoration of forestland to Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB), in Srinagar, they joined their protesting men against years of perceived injustices. Shri Aamarnath Yatra Sangarsh Samiti spearheading the agitation in Jammu, called for civil disobedience On the third and final day of the \\"Jail Bharo Andolan\\" of Shri Amarnath Yatra Sangharsh Samiti (SAYSS), over 2,00,000 protesters, including thousands of children, courted arrest in the Jammu region on 20 August 2008 .In the violent protests and clashes between the protesters and security forces, which continued till late evening, one person was killed while over 60 people, including 6 police personnel, sustained injuries. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan reviewed the security and political situation in Jammu and Kashmir at a meeting with Governor N.N. Vohra. The government has also pushed Track-II activists into a dialogue process with the separatists even as a four-member panel was scheduled to talk with the Shri Amarnath Sangarsh Samiti. End to SASB agitation On 31 August 2008, the 61-day-old agitation in the Jammu region over the Amarnath land row ended following the signing of an agreement between the group leading the agitation and the Jammu and Kashmir Governor-appointed panel.

Biography  Johanna van Warmelo was born on 18 November 1876, to Pastor Nicolaas Jacobus van Warmelo and his second wife Maria Magdalena Elizabeth Mar√©. Her father was a Dutch Reformed minister from the Netherlands whilst her mother's family had been early emigrants to southern Africa.Modernity and Religion, William Nicholls, p72, Papers presented at the Consultation on Modernity and Religion held at the University of British Columbia, 15‚Äì18 Dec. 1981, 1987 , accessed 8 August 2008 Brandt was educated for two years at the Good Hope Seminary for Young Ladies in Cape Town. When her father died in 1892, Johanna and her mother set out for a six- month tour of Europe. At the start of the Second Boer War in 1899, Johanna volunteered along with three of her brothers. She served as a nurse until the British captured Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal. The Boers did not immediately surrender, however, and a long guerrilla war began. Johanna's accomplice ‚Äì her mother. It was during this second phase of the Boer War that Brandt, who was living in Pretoria, became active for the Boer cause. She organised women to spy on British officers and hid prisoners who were on the run. It was her actions that led to W. T. Stead running an article in the Review of Reviews about the appalling conditions in the Irene Concentration Camp, which contributed to a decline in British public support for the war. After the war she wrote her own account of the Irene Concentration Camp, but her most well-known book was The Petticoat Commando, which told of her and her mother's exploits during the Boer War. The book is dedicated to her mother, \\"As a peace offering for having brought her into publicity in direct opposition to her wishes\\".The Petticoat Commando, Johanna Brandt, Project Gutenburg, 1913, accessed 8 August 2008 The Van Warmelos' house, which they called Harmony became a centre for the British occupying force. Johanna (who calls herself \\"Hansie\\" in the book) is shown as headstrong, and she and her mother exploit the British estimation of the two Boer women as harmless. Among the high-ranking British officers quartered nearby were Lord Kitchener, Lord Roberts and the Duke of Westminster. The Van Warmelos were largely left in peace by their \\"guests\\". This misplaced trust may have been due to Johanna's brother-in-law, Henry Cloete, who was married to her oldest sister. Cloete was a former British agent in South Africa and had been elevated as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George by Queen Victoria. In their role of harmless civilians, Johanna and her mother were able to collect information on the movements of soldiers and ammunition, and they smuggled this information out using letters written in invisible ink made from lemon juice. In 1902 Johanna married a minister, Louis Ernst Brandt. She had become so well known that messages of congratulations came from the leaders of countries.  World War I  Brandt remained involved in South African nationalist politics. When the British declared war on Germany in August 1914, they transferred the garrison in South Africa to the European front. Several Boer officers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Manie Maritz, seized this opportunity to declare South Africa's independence. When the Maritz Rebellion was crushed by the South African government 6 months later, the Nasionale Vroueparty, or National Women's Party, was formed in the Transvaal. Its purpose was to work to free the rebels and to care for their families, as well as to serve as an auxiliary for the National Party. Brandt served as secretary at the party's first congress, held in Johannesburg.‚ÄòMen of Influence‚Äô ‚Äì the ontology of leadership in the 1914 Boer Rebellion, Journal of Historical Sociology, Chapter 4, vol. 17, no.1, March 2004  Health writings  Johanna Brandt - Public meeting notice Brandt published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems. Her best-known publications are The Grape Cure and Fasting Book. The Grape Cure is said to have been written after Brandt claimed to have cured herself of stomach cancer. The book may have been inspired by the writings of Arnold Ehret, a contemporary, who taught a Grape Cure course, according to Sylvia Saltman.Sylvia Saltman, What Ever Happened To Arnold Ehret? Sylvia Saltman, USA: Vegetarian World Magazine, 1977, page 8. The conclusions expressed by Brandt in The Grape Cure have been denounced as \\"quackery\\", however, Brandt's book was an influence for South African author, Essie Honiball, who wrote I Live on Fruit,Essie Honiball, I Live on Fruit, South Africa: Benedic, 1989, 362 pages, , and Basil Shackleton, author of The Grape Cure: A Personal Testament.Basil Shackleton, The Grape Cure: A Personal Testament, Thorsons, 1969, 128 pages  Prophecy  Brandt wrote about revelations that were allegedly made to her on the evening of her mother's death on 7 December 1917 in Pretoria. She published these prophetic revelations in a book called The Millennium in 1918. Her other religious work was the Paraclete, or Coming World Mother which was published in 1936. The works include prophecies for South Africa in which she warns the \\"tribes\\" that they must heed their \\"masters\\" and of a \\"dark future\\". After an alleged angel's revelation in 1916, Brandt is reported to have spoken of South Africans as the chosen race and of Johannesburg being attacked by black people.'Volk' Faith and Fatherland: The Security Threat Posed by the White Right , Martin Sch√∂nteich and Henri Boshoff, accessed 8 August 2008  Legacy  In 2000, the South African Post office created a series of stamps about the writers of the Boer War, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Winston Churchill.

The EcoJet concept car is a concept car designed to run on biodiesel fuel, using a Honeywell LTS101 gas turbine instead of a reciprocating engine. The engine is normally used in helicopters and provides 650 horsepower and 583 ft-lb of torque. Drive is to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transaxle adapted from a C5 Corvette. An automatic transmission had to be used, because the turbine requires a constant load and operating a clutch with a manual gearbox would cause the turbine to overspeed. This concept car was the result of a collaboration between Jay Leno and General Motors, Honeywell, Alcoa and BASF. Unlike other concept cars, it was meant to be driven on the road in a regular fashion, as well as for show purposes. It is a two-seater car of a coup√© design with a hydroformed aluminum chassis and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer bodywork. The car contains two separate fuel tanks; one contains the main biodiesel fuel, soybean oil, and the other contains a conventional clean-burning jet engine fuel, Jet A (kerosene). The kerosene is used to start the turbine easily at the beginning of a trip and also to run the engine at the end of a trip to clean it, since biodiesel fuel tends to gum up the fuel system if not cleared. The exhaust gas temperature is 1000 degrees Fahrenheit in normal operation and 1800 Fahrenheit at full power. Exhaust is directed upward from two ports on the rear deck. In essence, the car runs on refined cooking oil, thus producing the same kind of smell created by cooking French fries. The car has an Azentek in-dash car computer running Microsoft Windows Vista, with two LCD screens on the dashboard ‚Äî one for the aircraft-style digital gauges and another for the multimedia and navigation controls ‚Äî as well as the standard PC functions, such as word processing and Web access through a WiMAX system. Two other smaller LCD screens are placed on the dashboard to provide rear views, as the car has no rear-view mirrors and uses cameras instead. The functions are controlled by Touchscreen or by Speech recognition software, using an array of microphones. The car was assembled by the Big Dog crew, mechanics employed by Jay Leno to help him maintain his large collection of cars.

Built in the early 18th century, it is a well preserved example of First Period architecture. Owned by a family association, it is only occasionally open to the public. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Phineas Upham house is located in what is now a residential area east of downtown Melrose, on the south side of Upham Street opposite its junction with Lincoln Street. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame house, three bays wide and two deep, with an off- center entrance and a centered chimney. Its window arrangement is irregular, with different sizes and shapes now filled with replacement diamond-paned casements. It probably began as a simple two-bay house, left of the chimney and was extended later in the 18th century with the addition of the third bay to the chimney's right. The rear of the house was also originally a single story (giving the house a saltbox appearance), but the roof was raised to a full two stories in the late 18th or early 19th century. The house's construction date is claimed by some local historians to be c. 1703, not long after Phineas Upham arrived in the area that is now Melrose. However, architectural and other historical evidence suggests that it was actually built by Phineas Upham for his son Amos, and would thus date to the late 1730s instead. The house remained in Upham family hands until the early 20th century. Its last occupant moved out in 1907, and in 1913 it was purchased by the Melrose Historical Society and restored. The Upham Family Association assumed ownership of the property in 1940, and now open it to the public two days each year.

In 1918, he was accepted into the Painting Division of the Taiwan Governor- General's National Language School. He taught himself painting after school through a copy of A Collection of Lectures, which he ordered from Japan through post. Upon graduating, he taught at Zuih≈ç Public School (in modern-day Ruifang District). During this time, he participated in the Summer Art Seminar organized by Ishikawa Kinichiro. His works 'Still Life and Backstreets of Sanxia' were selected for the first and second Taiwan Art Exhibitions (Taiten), respectively. He then obtained his family‚Äôs consent to go to Japan to further his painting studies. In 1929, he was accepted by the Division of Western Painting at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, where he studied with teachers such as Okada Saburousuke and Kobayashi Mango.

In 1935, his work Girl at Rest was the special selection of the ninth Taiwan Art Exhibition. In 1939, his work Red Dress was selected for the third Ministry of Education Art Exhibition (Shin Bunten). After World War II, Li served several terms as chairman of Sanxia street, township representative, and county councilor. From 1945, he served as director of the re-construction committee of Qingshui Zushi (Divine Ancestor) Temple in Sanxia.

Built about 1738, it is a good example of a mid-18th century colonial house. It was home to successive generations of Samuel Trains, who were all active in local politics and the state militia. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It is used as office space for the Rivers School, whose main campus is located across the street. Description and history The Samuel Train House is located in southern Weston, on the south side of Winter Street at its junction with Bogle Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, four bays wide, with a side gable roof and large central chimney. The chimney has six fireplaces, a bake oven, and a distinctive smoke chamber that is oriented to the front, placed where houses of this period normally have a winding staircase. The land on which this house stands was purchased by one of three consecutive John Trains in c. 1662. In 1735 Samuel Train, son of the third John Train, purchased from his father, and built this house three years later. Samuel was the first of three consecutive Samuels to occupy the house. All three served in the local militia: the first during the French and Indian War, the second in the American Revolutionary War (where he saw action at the Battles of Lexington and Concord), and the third in the War of 1812. The latter two were also instrumental in the establishment of the First Baptist Church of Weston. Samuel I was a town selectman, and Samuel III was a minister and state legislator. Later owners used the house as a milk house for their dairy operation.

The district encompasses the Sudbury Dam (also known as the Fayville Dam for the nearby neighborhood of Southborough), which impounds the reservoir, and an area encompassing several historic structures located below the dam. The area includes water-supply-related structures from three phases of development of the Greater Boston water supply system. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description Sudbury Dam was built in 1894 to impound the Stony Brook branch of the Sudbury River. It has a large earthen embankment in length, and a concrete core wall with a spillway wide. There is a gate chamber, designed by Wheelwright & Haven, located on the dam north of the spillway. At first it regulated the flow out the channel toward Framingham Reservoir No. 3, but it was modified in 1907 to control flow to the Weston Aqueduct as well, and again in 1916‚Äì17 for the provision of hydroelectric power. The facility was used for power generation until the 1970s, when the generation equipment was removed. A storehouse, located just northeast of the dam, was built in 1900 to house wooden stop planks used to regulate flow. This building was converted to house electrical equipment when the hydroelectric facility was built. Below the dam, to the northeast of the channel to Framingham Reservoir No. 3, is the head house for the Weston Aqueduct. Built in 1903, it was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge to harmonize with the existing gate house. Adjacent to this head house is the head house for Shaft #4 of the Hultman Aqueduct, built 1939‚Äì40. The Hultman Aqueduct is a high-pressure underground aqueduct carrying water from Wachusett Reservoir to staging facilities closer to Boston, acting as a secondary system since 2003 to the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel. This head house, also designed to harmonize with the previous buildings, was designed by Densmore, LeClear & Robbins, who also designed similar structures for the systems of the Quabbin Reservoir. There are also two modern buildings on the site (built in the 1970s) that are not architecturally sympathetic to the others, and a small cluster of 19th century farm buildings that were moved when the dam was built. There are two bridges in the district. The older of the two carries Massachusetts Route 30 over the open channel below the dam, and was built in 1898. It is a concrete twin-arch bridge, faced in granite. The second bridge, a single-arch span made of similar materials, carries an access road over the open channel to the Weston Aqueduct head house, and was built in 1902‚Äì03.

The Sinkha Project is a series of digital comics and multimedia novels created by Marco Patrito, an Italian science- fiction author and illustrator who has published comic novels in Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Holland and North America since 1984. He has drawn more than 150 cover illustrations for Italian publisher Arnoldo Mondadori Editore.Episode 2, Extras, 2007. The Sinkha Universe, originally conceived by Patrito in early 1991, was used as a set for the first Sinkha multimedia novel, which was completely realized using ground-breaking 3D computer graphics over the course of five years. In 1995, the Sinkha CD-ROM was finally distributed by Virtual Views in Europe, USA and Japan for Mac OS and Windows operating systems.  Episodes  As of 2008, the Sinkha Project is composed of four multimedia novels (Episodes 0, 1, 2 and 3) and three graphic novels (Episodes 1, 2 and 3). The printed versions are available in Italian, French, Portuguese and German languages. Episodes 0 and 1 were also published in English on special issues of the American magazine Heavy Metal.  Sinkha 0: First Encounter [1995]  Comparison of 8-bit and 24-bit versions. Sinkha tells the story of Hyleyn, a bold girl who lives in the mysterious city of Thalissar. This gigantic and gloomy agglomeration of howling metal, located on the hostile planet Ogon, proves to be of great interest to the Sinkha, a race of immortals who send their living starship Darcron to investigate.'' Presented as the first multimedia novel completely realized in 3D computer graphics; although it was published in 1993, Donna Matrix, by Mike Saenz, is credited as the first digital graphic novel utilizing 3D rendering. Sinkha was released in 1995 for Mac OS 7, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. It features 8-bit graphics and a monaural soundtrack. It specifically requires QuickTime 2 and does not work properly on recent operating systems, although it is possible to run it via emulators like Basilisk and DOSBox. In 1998, Marco Patrito was approached by a Hollywood film producer wanting to turn Sinkha into a movie. Patrito was asked to draw up a \\"feature film treatment\\" based on the novel, with the addition of some variants. The draft was approved and pre-production started, but budget troubles quickly arose. A non-negotiable clause was that the movie would have to be done entirely in computer graphics, which at the time were very expensive. When the estimated figure (over twenty million dollars) was judged to be insufficient, a proposal was made to use real and affordable actors that were not overly famous, but the situation stalled. It was impossible to move beyond that impasse, and the project was ultimately abandoned. However, in 2002, the second multimedia novel, Hyleyn, included an abridged version of Sinkha based on the synopsis of this aborted movie. Subtitled First Encounter, it contained fewer, but enhanced (although static) CG artworks, as well as an expanded description of the original events. In 2008, the original Sinkha was remastered with 24-bit graphics and a full stereophonic soundtrack. It was re- released as Sinkha Zero. The music of Episode 0 was composed by the neo-prog band Fancyfluid (Sandro Bruni and Fabrizio Goria). Sinkha received a score of 2 out of 5 from MacUser. The author praised the graphics, but heavily criticized the story, noting that \\"the writing is, well, even more stilted and sloppy than that of the average graphic novel.\\"  Sinkha 1: Hyleyn [2002]  Hyleyn, the main 3D heroine of the series. As an added bonus, Hyleyn includes an abridged version of Sinkha which contains fewer but enhanced (although static) CG artworks, as well as an expanded description of the original events.

History The 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade was originally raised in 1940 as the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade. In this guise it was involved in the East African Campaign against the forces of the Italian Colonial Empire in Kenya under the command of Brigadier Gerald Smallwood. Later it was renamed the 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade and was attached to the 1st (African) Division. In February 1941, the 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade took the Italian Somaliland capital of Mogadishu. On 10 March 1941, the Brigade quickly advanced to Degehabur, about south of Jijiga, and captured the city days later without resistance, before it participated in the reoccupation of British Somaliland later in the year. In 1944 the Brigade was attached to the 82nd (West Africa) Division and renamed the 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade. In this same year it sailed for Ceylon, where the complete division was assembled on 20 July. They then moved to Burma and took part in the third Arakan campaign in December 1944. During this campaign, the Brigade first advanced south along the Kalapanzin valley, then crossed a steep and jungle-covered mountain range to converge with the British 81st (West Africa) Division on Myohaung at the mouth of the Kaladan River. This move forced the Japanese to evacuate the Mayu peninsula which they had held for almost four years, and retreat south along the coast. They continued to advance maintaining pressure on the Japanese, capturing the port of Gwa shortly before the Japanese abandoned Burma..

It runs for from Farm Pond at Waverly Street in Framingham to Chestnut Hill Reservoir in Boston‚Äôs Chestnut Hill neighborhood. A later built extension main runs from the Farm Pond gatehouse to the gatehouse at the Stearns Reservoir (Framingham Reservoir #1) where additional mains connect to the Brackett and Foss Reservoirs (Framingham #2 and #3.) Going east from Framingham, it runs through Sherborn before entering Natick. From Natick it runs east through Wellesley and Needham to the Charles River, which it crosses on the Echo Bridge into Newton. It ends at the Chestnut Hill Reservoir on the Newton side of the Newton-Boston line.Scott Johnson, The Sudbury Aqueduct, December 16, 2004 The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) operates the aqueduct. Construction The Sudbury Aqueduct was constructed between 1875 and 1878, and was in use for almost 100 years. It was designed to carry water from the watershed of the Sudbury River to Boston and its surrounding communities. Reservoirs in Framingham and Southborough were constructed to impound this water at the time of the aqueduct's development, and additional reservoirs in Ashland and Hopkinton were constructed in the 1880s in an attempt to meet increased demand. Finally in the 1890s the Sudbury Reservoir was created in 1898, significantly increasing the amount of water available for distribution. For most of the Sudbury Aqueduct's history after the Sudbury Reservoir was built the water was primarily sourced from the Foss Reservoir which the Sudbury Reservoir feeds with Reservoirs #1 and #2 serving as reserve supply due to the Sudbury Reservoir's superior water quality over the Reservoir #2 system. The aqueduct consists primarily of a horseshoe-shaped brick lining that is in diameter and high. The bricks are set in concrete atop a foundation of concrete and stone rubble. The aqueduct is covered by an arch built of brick. The aqueduct was initially designed to carry 80 million gallons of water per day, limited by the Rosemary Brook Siphon. An additional barrel was later added to the Rosemary Brook Siphon increasing the design capacity to 110 mgd. The main conduit from Farm Pond to Chestnut Hill Reservoir is inclined one foot per mile. At a number of places on the aqueduct small buildings were built to house control equipment of various sorts. These include a gate house at Farm Pond (abandoned after a channel was constructed feeding the aqueduct from Framingham Reservoirs #1-3 due to poor water quality at Farm Pond), a metering house in southeastern Framingham, and control houses over weirs where the aqueduct crosses over other bodies of water. These control points allow water from the aqueduct to be diverted into the watersheds it crosses. There are also control houses on either end of the Rosemary Brook siphon in Wellesley, where the water is sent through cast iron pipes to traverse an extended low spot on the route. This stretch of the aqueduct illustrates a number of the techniques used in its construction: parts of the aqueduct here are raised on an embankment, while others are in a cut, due to significant changes in local topography. Portions of the aqueduct in Natick and Newton were created by tunneling, the longest being a tunnel in Newton. In addition to the Echo Bridge, the aqueduct also passes over the \\"Waban Arches\\" bridge. Located in Wellesley near the Elm Bank Reservation, this nine-arch bridge carries the aqueduct across a valley containing Waban Brook near its mouth at the Charles River. The aqueduct formally ends at a terminal house just above the Chestnut Hill Reservoir in Newton. Relegation to backup service In the 20th century the aqueduct's functions were first augmented and then replaced by the Weston Aqueduct, the Hultman Aqueduct, and the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel. The aqueduct was taken out of regular service in 1978, and now forms part of the MWRA's emergency backup systems. Along with the Weston Aqueduct it is one of two emergency backup transmission aqueducts to carry water from the Sudbury and Foss reservoirs, MRWA's backup sources. If brought online water would enter the Sudbury aqueduct at its gatehouse at the Stearns Reservoir (Framingham #1) from two 48 inch pipes from the Foss Reservoir (Framingham #3) which is in turn fed by an open channel from the Sudbury Reservoir. The water would then pass through the aqueduct and enter Chestnut Hill Reservoir where it could then be taken into the water system. The aqueduct formerly could also be fed directly by the Stearns and Brackett reservoirs (Framingham #1 and #2) and Farm Pond as well as indirectly by Whitehall Pond, Ashland Reservoir, and Hopkinton Reservoir which discharge into the Bracket Reservoir; for water quality reasons generally only the Foss Reservoir was regularly used for most of the aqueduct's history and is the only one of the reservoirs that is still maintained as an emergency water source. Waste Weir A and its control house in Sherborn It was put into emergency use on May 1, 2010, when a wide supply pipe (only seven years old) broke in Weston. Clean water was directed through alternate pipelines to bypass the break, but to provide all the water needed, but the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority supplemented the water supply by tapping the Chestnut Hill Reservoir; water from the Sudbury Reservoir and Foss Reservoir was sent through the Sudbury Aqueduct to Chestnut Hill to keep that supply going. The Chestnut Hill water was untreated, so about 2 million residents in about 30 communities in the Boston area were under orders for about three days to disinfect tap water by boiling. Later testing showed that the water was in the end of good quality and safe to drink. On January 18, 1990, the route, buildings and structures associated with the aqueduct were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Sudbury Aqueduct Linear District. Much of the aqueduct's route is open to the public as an unimproved walking trail.

A traditional explanation of the French term mouchard, meaning police spy or informer, is that it derived from his use of intelligence-gathering networks, when working as an inquisitor.:fr:wikt:mouchard This folk-etymology was adopted by Voltaire, following Fran√ßois-Eudes de M√©zeray. It has been plausibly contested, on the grounds that the word is found used in the fifteenth century. Life De Mouchy was born at Ressons-sur-Matz, near Beauvais, in Picardy. In 1539 he was appointed rector of the University of Paris. He was also professor at the Sorbonne and canon Penitentiarius of Noyon. He was one of a group of Sorbonne doctors who in the 1550s began detailed scholarship on lists of bishops, to support the apostolic succession.http://www.catho-theo.net/L-historien-et-la- theologie#nh24, in French.

He was the second son of the Rev. Frederic Myers, author of Catholic Thoughts, and Susan Harriett Myers (n√©e Marshall). (His elder brother was F W H Myers, the poet, critic and psychical researcher.)  Early life  Educated at Cheltenham and Balliol College, Oxford, (where he won the Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse in 1865), Ernest Myers became a fellow of Wadham College in 1868, teaching there for three years. In 1871, he moved to London, joining the Inner Temple and being called to the bar; however, he never practised as a barrister. Instead, he made his living as a translator and editor and also joined the committees of organisations such as the University Extension Society, the Charity Organisation Society, the Society for the Protection of Women & Children, and the Hellenic Society of which he was a founder member.  Writing  Myers published poetry in The Puritans (1869), translated the Odes of Pindar (1874), followed in 1877 by a volume entitled Poems. A further, larger volume of his own poetry followed in 1880, The Defence of Rome and Other Poems, and he contributed an article on Aeschylus to a collection of Classical essays edited by Evelyn Abbott. In 1882 he collaborated with Andrew Lang and Walter Leaf on books XVII-XXIV of Homer's Iliad (a companion volume to a translation of the Odyssey). Further volumes of poetry followed in the coming years: The Judgement of Prometheus (1886); and Gathered Poems (1904). He also wrote Lord Althorp: a biography (1890).  Family  In London, in 1883, Myers married Nora Margaret Lodge (1858‚Äì1952) (a sister of George Edward Lodge), and they had five children. The family moved from London to Chislehurst in 1891. Their elder son - who may have been the subject of Myers‚Äô poem Infant Eyes - died as a soldier in France in 1918, the last year of World War I. Myers maintained a love of physical exercise throughout his life, including swimming, riding, lawn tennis, walking, and golf. He died on 25 November 1921 at Etchingham, Sussex, aged 77.
