Eagle, a yacht, was built in 1890 as Almy by Harlan and Hollingsworth, Wilmington, Delaware; purchased by the Navy on 2 April 1898 and renamed Eagle; and commissioned three days later, Lieutenant William Henry Hudson Southerland in command. Service history Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Eagle sailed from New York on 17 April 1898 for duty with the North Atlantic Squadron on blockade and dispatch duty in Cuban waters. On 29 June, she shelled the Spanish battery at Rio Honda and on 12 July captured the Spanish merchantman Santo Domingo. Eagle returned to Norfolk on 22 August to be fitted out for surveying duty, her principal employment through the remainder of her naval service. She compiled new charts and corrected existing ones for the waters surrounding Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Haiti. Pre-World War I Troubled conditions throughout the Caribbean often interrupted Eagles surveying duty and she gave varied service in protecting American interests. She patrolled off Haiti in January‚ÄìFebruary 1908 and again in November and December and off Nicaragua in December 1909. In June 1912, she transported Marines to Santiago de Cuba and Siboney to protect American lives and property during a rebellion in Cuba, and continued to investigate conditions and serve as base ship for the Marines until 1914. She also had gunboat duty with a cruiser squadron during the Haiti operation of July 1915-March 1916, and was commended by the Secretary of the Navy for her creditable performance of widely varied duty. She then remained off Haiti to conduct surveys. World War I With American entry into World War I, Eagle returned to Cuban waters. She was attached to American Patrol Detachment, Atlantic Fleet, and throughout 1917‚Äì1918 was continually on patrol off Cuba, Santo Domingo, and the southern coast of the United States. From Key West, Florida, where she arrived on 3 April 1918, she patrolled the Florida Straits and after the end of the war operated on target practice, and tactical exercises and maneuvers. From 7 January ‚Äì 15 March 1919, she made a cruise to Cuban ports and along the Gulf coast before being detached from the American Patrol Detachment on 28 April. Eagle left Key West the following day for Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was decommissioned there on 23 May and sold on 3 January 1920.

It was named after the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway. It is a brownish-grey bird with barred tail and underparts. It feeds mainly on reptiles, but also consumes small birds and mammals. It nests high in a tree in spring. Populations of this bird have been declining because of habitat destruction and human persecution in the Dominican Republic and is classified as \\"critically endangered\\". Description This is a medium-sized, compact hawk, 36‚Äì41 cm long. The adult has brown-grey upperparts, greyish barred underparts with a reddish-brown wash, rufous-tinged thighs and a black-and-white barred tail. The male is greyer than the female. The legs and base of bill are yellow. This bird feeds on small mammals, birds, lizards and snakes. It nests in the crowns of tall trees, with nest-building in February and March and egg-laying in March and April. Distribution The Ridgway's hawk's original breeding range includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic (which make up the island of Hispaniola) and some of the adjacent isles and keys. However, sightings are much more common in the Dominican Republic. Status This bird is critically endangered due to clearance of its forest habitat and persecution by local farmers, who claim that the species preys upon their domestic fowl. Conservationists have countered that poultry is nothing more than a minor element of their diet and that the Ridgway's Hawk has a highly varied prey base, though reptiles comprise up to 90% of its diet. It has an estimated population of 80-120 pairs, making it, along with the bay-breasted cuckoo (Coccyzus rufigularis), the most threatened bird of Hispaniola. It is thought the population has been reduced to nothing more than around 400 individuals. The only known surviving redoubt is the Los Haitises National Park and the surrounding wilderness of the north-western Dominican Republic. This bird is named after the ornithologist Robert Ridgway.

The most common types are the open-bottomed wet bell and the closed bell, which can maintain an internal pressure greater than the external ambient. Diving bells are usually suspended by a cable, and lifted and lowered by a winch from a surface support platform. Unlike a submersible, the diving bell is not designed to move under the control of its occupants, nor to operate independently of its launch and recovery system. The wet bell is a structure with an airtight chamber which is open to the water at the bottom, that is lowered underwater to operate as a base or a means of transport for a small number of divers. Air is trapped inside the bell by pressure of the water at the interface. These were the first type of diving chamber, and are still in use in modified form. The closed bell is a pressure vessel for human occupation, which may be used for bounce diving or saturation diving, with access to the water through a hatch at the bottom. The hatch is sealed before ascent to retain internal pressure. At the surface, this type of bell can lock on to a hyperbaric chamber where the divers live under saturation or are decompressed. The bell is mated with the chamber system via the bottom hatchway or a side hatchway, and the trunking in between is pressurized to enable the divers to transfer through to the chamber under pressure. In saturation diving the bell is merely the ride to and from the job, and the chamber system is the living quarters. If the dive is relatively short (a bounce dive), decompression can be done in the bell in exactly the same way it would be done in the chamber. History A diving bell renovated as a tourist attraction on Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration. Its use was first described by Aristotle in the 4th century BC: \\"they enable the divers to respire equally well by letting down a cauldron, for this does not fill with water, but retains the air, for it is forced straight down into the water.\\" According to Roger Bacon, Alexander the Great explored the Mediterranean on the authority of Ethicus the astronomer. In 1535, Guglielmo de Lorena created and used what is considered to be the first modern diving bell. In 1616, Franz Kessler built an improved diving bell. In 1642, John Winthrop reports one Edward Bendall building two large wooden barrels, weighted with lead and open at their bottoms, to salvage a ship Mary Rose which had exploded and sunk, blocking the harbor of Charlestown, Boston. Bendall undertook the work on condition that he be awarded all the value of the salvage should he succeed in unblocking the harbor, or half the value he could salvage if he could not. In 1658, Albrecht von Treileben was permitted to salvage the warship Vasa, which sank in Stockholm harbor on its maiden voyage in 1628. Between 1663 and 1665 von Treileben's divers were successful in raising most of the cannons, working from a diving bell. A diving bell is mentioned in the 1663 Ballad of Gresham College (stanza 16): In late 1686, Sir William Phipps convinced investors to fund an expedition to what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic to find sunken treasure, despite the location of the shipwreck being based entirely on rumor and speculation. In January 1687, Phipps found the wreck of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Se√±ora de la Concepci√≥n off the coast of Santo Domingo. Some sources say they used an inverted container for the salvage operation while others say the crew was assisted by Indian divers in the shallow waters. The operation lasted from February to April 1687 during which time they salvaged jewels, some gold and 30 tons of silver which, at the time, was worth over ¬£200,000. In 1689, Denis Papin suggested that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a force pump or bellows. Engineer John Smeaton utilized this concept in 1789. In 1691, Dr. Edmond Halley completed plans for a diving bell capable of remaining submerged for extended periods of time, and fitted with a window for the purpose of undersea exploration. In Halley's design, atmosphere is replenished by sending weighted barrels of air down from the surface. In 1775, Charles Spalding, an Edinburgh confectioner, improved on Halley's design by adding a system of balance- weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signaling the surface crew. Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, later suffocated off the coast of Dublin in 1783 doing salvage work in a diving bell of Spalding's design.

File:Diving bell.jpgDiving bell File:Charles Spalding Diving Bell, The Saturday Magazine, Vol. 14, 1839.pngSpalding's Diving Bell, The Saturday Magazine, Vol. 14, 1839 Mechanics Occupied diving bell illustrated. From Otto Lueger, (Dictionary of Technology), 1904 The bell is lowered into the water by cables from a crane, gantry or A-frame attached to a floating platform or shore structure. The bell is ballasted so as to remain upright in the water and to be negatively buoyant, so that it will sink even when full of air. Hoses, supplied by gas compressors or banks of high pressure storage cylinders at the surface, provide breathing gas to the bell, serving two functions: * Fresh gas is available for breathing by the occupants. * Volume reduction of the air in an open bell due to increasing hydrostatic pressure as the bell is lowered is compensated. Adding pressurized gas ensures that the gas space within the bell remains at constant volume as the bell descends in the water. Otherwise the bell would partially fill with water as the gas was compressed. The physics of the diving bell applies also to an underwater habitat equipped with a moon pool, which is like a diving bell enlarged to the size of a room or two, and with the water‚Äìair interface at the bottom confined to a section rather than forming the entire bottom of the structure. Wet bell Open diving bell on a stern mounted launch and recovery system A wet bell is a platform for lowering and lifting divers to and from the underwater workplace, which has an air filled space, open at the bottom, where the divers can stand or sit with their heads out of the water. The air space is at ambient pressure at all times, so there are no great pressure differences, and the greatest structural loads are usually self weight and the buoyancy of the air space. A fairly heavy ballast is often required to counteract the buoyancy of the airspace, and this is usually set low at the bottom of the bell, which helps with stability. The base of the bell is usually a grating or deck which the divers can stand on, and folding seats may be fitted for the divers' comfort during ascent, as in-water decompression may be long. Other equipment that is carried on the bell include cylinders with the emergency gas supply, and racks or boxes for tools and equipment to be used on the job. There may be a tackle for hoisting and supporting a disabled diver so that their head projects into the air space. =Type 1 wet bell= The type 1 wet bell does not have an umbilical supplying the bell. Umbilicals supply the divers directly from the surface, similar to a diving stage. Divers deploying from a type 1 bell will exit on the opposite side to where the umbilicals enter the bell so that the umbilicals pass through the bell and the divers can find their way back to the bell at all times by following the umbilical. Bailout from a type 1 bell is done by exiting the bell on the side that the umbilicals enter the bell so they no longer pass through the bell, leaving the divers free to surface. =Type 2 wet bell= A gas panel inside the bell is supplied by the bell umbilical and the emergency gas cylinders, and supplies the divers' umbilicals and sometimes BIBS sets. There will be racks to hang the divers' excursion umbilicals, which for this application must not be buoyant. Abandonment of a type 2 wet bell requires the divers to manage their own umbilicals as they ascend along a remaining connection to the surface. Operation of a wet bell The bell with divers on board is deployed from the working platform (usually a vessel) by a crane, davit or other mechanism with a man-rated winch. The bell is lowered into the water and to the working depth at a rate recommended by the decompression schedule, and which allows the divers to equalize comfortably. Wet bells with an air space will have the air space topped up as the bell descends and the air is compressed by increasing hydrostatic pressure. The air will also be refreshed as required to keep the carbon dioxide level acceptable to the occupants. The oxygen content is also replenished, but this is not the limiting factor, as the oxygen partial pressure will be higher than in surface air due to the depth. When the bell is raised, the pressure will drop and excess air due to expansion will automatically spill under the edges. If the divers are breathing from the bell airspace at the time, it may need to be vented with additional air to maintain a low carbon dioxide level. The decrease in pressure is proportional to the depth as the airspace is at ambient pressure, and the ascent must be conducted according to the planned decompression schedule appropriate to the depth and duration of the diving operation.

These functional requirements dictate the structure and arrangement. The internal pressure requires a strong structure, and a sphere or spherical ended cylinder is most efficient for this purpose. When the bell is underwater, it must be possible for the occupants to get in or out without flooding the entire interior. This requires a pressure hatch at the bottom. The requirement that the bell retains its internal pressure when the external pressure is lowered dictates that the hatch opens inward, so that internal pressure will hold it closed. Locking onto a decompression chamber at the surface is possible either from the bottom or the side. Using the bell bottom hatch for this purpose has the advantage of only needing one hatch, and the disadvantage of having to lift the bell up and place it over a vertical entry to the chamber. The bell bottom hatch must be wide enough for a large diver fully kitted with appropriate bailout cylinders, to get in and out without undue difficulty, and it can not be closed while the diver is outside as the umbilical is tended through the hatch by the bellman. It must also be possible for the bellman to lift the working diver in through the hatch if he is unconscious, and close the hatch after him, so that the bell can be raised and pressurised for the ascent. A lifting tackle is usually fitted inside the bell for this purpose, and the bell may be partially flooded to assist the procedure. The internal space must be large enough for a fully kitted diver and bellman (the stand-by diver responsible for manning the bell while the working diver is locked out) to sit, and for their umbilicals to be stowed neatly on racks, and the hatch to be opened inwards while they are inside. Anything bigger will make the bell heavier than it really needs to be, so all equipment that does not need to be inside is mounted outside. This includes a framework to support the ancillary equipment and protect the bell from impact and snagging on obstacles, and the emergency gas and power supplies, which are usually racked around the framework. The EGS is connected via manifolds to the internal gas panel. The part of the framework that keeps the lower hatch off the bottom is called the bell stage. It may be removable. The bell umbilical is connected to the bell via through hull fittings (hull penetrations), which must withstand all operating pressures without leaking. The internal gas panel connects to the hull penetrations and the diver's umbilicals. The umbilicals will carry main breathing gas supply, a communications cable, a pneumofathometer hose, hot water supply for suit heating, power for helmet mounted lights, and possibly gas reclaim hose and video cable. The bell umbilical will usually also carry a power cable for internal and external bell lighting. Hydraulic power lines for tools do not have to pass into the interior of the bell as they will never be used there, and tools can also be stored outside. There may be an emergency through-water communications system with a battery power supply, and a location transponder working on the international standard 37.5 kHz. The bell may also have viewports and a medical lock. A closed bell may be fitted with an umbilical cutter, a mechanism which allows the occupants to sever the bell umbilical from inside the sealed and pressurised bell in the event of an umbilical snag that prevents bell recovery. The device is typically hydraulically operated using a hand pump inside the bell, and can shear the umbilical at or just above the point where it is fastened to the top of the bell. Once cut, the bell can be raised and if the umbilical can then be recovered, it can be reconnected with only a short length lost. An external connection known as a hot stab unit which allows an emergency umbilical to be connected to maintain life support in the bell during a rescue operation may be fitted. The divers in the bell may also be monitored from the diving control point by closed circuit video, and the bell atmosphere can be monitored for volatile hydrocarbon contamination by a hyperbaric hydrocarbon analyser which can be linked to a topside repeater and set to give an alarm if the hydrocarbon levels exceed 10% of the anaesthetic level. The bell may be fitted with an external emergency battery power pack, carbon dioxide scrubber for the internal atmosphere, and air conditioner for temperature control. Power supply is typically 12 or 24V DC. =British mini-bell system= A variant of this system used in the North Sea oilfields between early 1986 and the early 90s was the Oceantech Minibell system, which was used for bell-bounce dives, and was operated as an open bell for the descent, and as a closed bell for the ascent. The divers would climb into the bell after stowing their umbilicals on outside racks, remove their helmets for outside storage, seal the bell, and return to the surface, venting to the depth of the first decompression stop. The bell would then be locked onto a deck decompression chamber, the divers transferred under pressure to complete decompression in the chamber, and the bell would be available for use for another dive. Deployment of a modern diving bell Personnel Transfer Capsule ‚Äì closed diving bell Diving bells are deployed over the side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame from which the clump weight and the bell are suspended. On dive support vessels with in-built saturation systems the bell may be deployed through a moon pool. The bell handling system is also known as the launch and recovery system (LARS). The bell umbilical supplies gas to the bell gas panel, and is separate from the divers' excursion umbilicals, which are connected to the gas panel on the inside of the bell. The bell umbilical is deployed from a large drum or umbilical basket and care is taken to keep the tension in the umbilical low but sufficient to remain near vertical in use and to roll up neatly during recovery, as this reduces the risk of the umbilical snagging on underwater obstructions. Wet bell handling differs from closed bell handling in that there is no requirement to transfer the bell to and from the chamber system to make a pressure-tight connection, and that a wet bell will be required to maintain a finely controlled speed of descent and ascent and remain at a fixed depth within fairly close tolerances for the occupants to decompress at a specific ambient pressure, whereas a closed bell can be removed from the water without delay and the speed of ascent and descent is not critical. A bell diving team will usually include two divers in the bell, designated the working diver and bellman, though they may alternate these roles during the dive. The bellman is a stand-by diver and umbilical tender from the bell to the working diver, the operator of the on-board gas distribution panel, and has an umbilical about 2 m longer than the working diver to ensure that the working diver can be reached in an emergency. This can be adjusted by tying off the umbilicals inside the bell to limit deployment length, which must often be done in any case, to prevent the divers from approaching known hazards in the water. Depending on circumstances, there may also be a surface stand-by diver, with attendant in case there is an emergency where the surface diver could assist. The team be under the direct control of the diving supervisor and will also include a winch operator, and may include a dedicated surface gas panel operator. Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. Deployment of the bell is by a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads prevent it from rotating on the deployment cable, which would put twist into the umbilical and risk loops or snagging. The clump weight cables therefore act as guidelines or rails along which the bell is lowered to the workplace, and raised back to the platform. If the lifting winch or cable fails, and the bell ballast is released, a positively buoyant bell can float up and the cables will guide it to the surface to a position where it can be recovered relatively easily. The clump weight cable can also be used as an emergency recovery system, in which case both bell and weight are lifted together. An alternative system for preventing rotation on the lifting cable is the use of a cross-haul system, which may also be used as a means of adjusting the lateral position of the bell at working depth, and as an emergency recovery system. A closed bell handling system is used to move the bell from the position where it is locked on to the chamber system into the water, lower it to the working depth and hold it in position without excessive movement, and recover it to the chamber system. The system used to transfer the bell on deck may be a deck trolley system, an overhead gantry or a swinging A-frame. The system must constrain movement of the supported bell sufficiently to allow accurate location on the chamber trunking even in bad weather. A bell cursor may be used to control movement through and above the splash zone, and heave compensation gear may be used to limit vertical movement when in the water and clear of the cursor, particularly at working depth when the diver may be locked out and the bell is open to ambient pressure. A bell cursor is a device used to guide and control the motion of the bell through the air and the splash zone near the surface, where waves can move the bell significantly. It can either be a passive system which relies on additional ballast weight or an active system which uses a controlled drive system to provide vertical motion. The cursor has a cradle which locks onto the bell and which moves vertically on rails to constrain lateral movement. The bell is released and locked onto the cursor in the relatively still water below the splash zone. Heave compensation equipment is used to stabilise the depth of the bell by counteracting vertical movement of the handling system caused by movements of the platform, and usually also maintains correct tension on the guide wires. It is not usually essential, depending on the stability of the platform. Cross-hauling systems are cables from an independent lifting device which are intended to be used to move the bell laterally from a point directly below the LARS, and may also be used to limit rotation and as an emergency bell recovery system. Use with hyperbaric chambers Commercial diving contractors generally use a closed bell in conjunction with a surface hyperbaric chamber, These have safety and ergonomic advantages and allow decompression to be carried out after the bell has been raised to the surface and back on board the diving support vessel. Closed bells are often used in saturation diving and undersea rescue operations. The diving bell would be connected via the mating flange of an airlock to the deck decompression chamber or saturation system for transfer under pressure of the occupants.  Air-lock diving bells  Barge with air-lock diving ball for working on moorings right The air lock diving-bell plant was a purpose-built barge for the laying, examination and repair of moorings for battleships at Gibraltar harbour. It was designed by Siebe Gorman of Lambeth and Forrestt & Co. Ltd of Wivenhoe in Essex, who built and supplied it in 1902 to the British Admiralty. The vessel came about from the specific conditions at Gibraltar. The heavy harbour moorings have three chains extending out radially along the seabed from a central ring, each terminating in a large anchor. Most harbours have a soft seabed, and it is usual to lay down moorings by settling anchors in the mud, clay or sand but this could not be done in Gibraltar harbour, where the seabed is hard rock. In operation the barge would be towed over the work site, moored in place with anchors, and the bell would be lowered vertically to the bottom. and the water displaced by pumping. The work teams entered the bell through an airlock in the central access shaft. Working in ordinary clothes they could dig out anchorings for the moorings. The German service barge Carl Straat is similar in concept, but the bell is lowered by swinging the access tube. Carl Straat was built in 1963 for the Waterways and Shipping Directorate West in M√ºnster. The 6 m √ó 4 m √ó 2.5 m bell is accessible through a 2 m diameter tube and an airlock. A pantograph system keeps the bell and internal stairs level at all depths. Maximum working depth is 10 m. The vessel is used on those inland waterways which have locks large enough to accommodate its 52 m length overall, 11.8 m beam and 1.6 m draft. Rescue bell A Swedish Navy submarine rescue diving bell from the early 1940s Diving bells have been used for submarine rescue. The closed dry bell is designed to seal against the deck of the submarine above an escape hatch. Water in the space between the bell and the submarine is pumped out and the hatches can be opened to allow occupants to leave the submarine and enter the bell. The hatches are then closed, the bell skirt flooded to release it from the submarine, and the bell with its load of survivors is hoisted back to the surface, where the survivors exit and the bell may return for the next group. The internal pressure in the bell is usually kept at atmospheric pressure to minimise run time by eliminating the need for decompression, so the seal between the bell skirt and the submarine deck is critical to the safety of the operation. This seal is provided by using a flexible sealing material, usually a type of rubber, which is pressed firmly against the smooth hatch surround by the pressure differential when the skirt is pumped out. Diver training Diver training using a wet bell Divers qualified to work from bells are trained in the skills and procedures relevant to the type of bell they will be expected to work from. Open bells are generally used for surface oriented surface-supplied deep air diving, and closed bells are used for saturation diving and surface oriented mixed gas diving. These skills include the standard procedures for the deployment of the working diver from the bell, the tending of the working diver from the bell by the bellman, and the emergency and rescue procedures for both working diver and bellman. There is considerable similarity and significant differences in these procedures between open and closed bell diving. Underwater habitats As noted above, further extension of the wet bell concept is the moon-pool- equipped underwater habitat, where divers may spend long periods in dry comfort while acclimated to the increased pressure experienced underwater. By not needing to return to the surface between excursions into the water, they can reduce the necessity for decompression (gradual reduction of pressure), after each excursion, required to avoid problems with nitrogen bubbles releasing from the bloodstream (the bends, also known as caisson disease). Such problems can occur at pressures greater than , corresponding to a depth of of water. Divers in an ambient pressure habitat will require decompression when they return to the surface. This is a form of saturation diving. In nature The diving bell spider, Argyroneta aquatica, is a spider which lives entirely under water, even though it could survive on land. Since the spider must breathe air, it constructs from silk a habitat like an open diving bell which it attaches to an underwater plant. The spider collects air in a thin layer around its body, trapped by dense hairs on its abdomen and legs. It transports this air to its diving bell to replenish the air supply in the bell. This allows the spider to remain in the bell for long periods, where it waits for its prey.

Here, \\"minimal\\" means that satisfies the following universal property: for every linear map from to a commutative algebra , there is a unique algebra homomorphism g:S(V)\\\\to A such that f=g\\\\circ i, where is the inclusion map of in . If is a basis of , the symmetric algebra can be identified, through a canonical isomorphism, to the polynomial ring , where the elements of are considered as indeterminates. Therefore, the symmetric algebra over can be viewed as a \\"coordinate free\\" polynomial ring over . The symmetric algebra can be built as the quotient of the tensor algebra by the two-sided ideal generated by the elements of the form x\\\\otimes y-y\\\\otimes x. All these definitions and properties extend naturally to the case where is a module (not necessarily a free one) over a commutative ring. Construction From tensor algebra It is possible to use the tensor algebra to describe the symmetric algebra . In fact, can be defined as the quotient algebra of by the two sided ideal generated by the commutators v\\\\otimes w - w\\\\otimes v. It is straightforward, but rather tedious, to verify that the resulting algebra satisfies the universal property stated in the introduction. This results also directly from a general result of category theory, which asserts that the composition of two left adjoint functors is also a left adjoint functor. Here, the forgetful functor from commutative algebras to vector spaces or modules (forgetting the multiplication) is the composition of the forgetful functors from commutative algebras to associative algebras (forgetting commutativity), and from associative algebras to vectors or modules (forgetting the multiplication). As the tensor algebra and the quotient by commutators are left adjoint to these forgetful functors, their composition is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from commutative algebra to vectors or modules, and this proves the desired universal property. From polynomial ring The symmetric algebra can also be built from polynomial rings. If is a -vector space or a free -module, with a basis , let be the polynomial ring that has the elements of as indeterminates. The homogeneous polynomials of degree one form a vector space or a free module that can be identified with . It is straightforward to verify that this makes a solution to the universal problem stated in the introduction. This implies that and are canonically isomorphic, and can therefore be identified. This results also immediately from general considerations of category theory, since free modules and polynomial rings are free objects of their respective categories. If is a module that is not free, it can be written V=L/M, where is a free module, and is a submodule of . In this case, one has :S(V)=S(L/M)=S(L)/\\\\langle M\\\\rangle, where \\\\langle M\\\\rangle is the ideal generated by . (Here, equals signs mean equality up to a canonical isomorphism.) Again this can be proved by showing that one has a solution of the universal property, and this can be done either by a straightforward but boring computation, or by using category theory, and more specifically, the fact that a quotient is the solution of the universal problem for morphisms that map to zero a given subset (Depending on the case, the kernel is a normal subgroup, a submodule or an ideal, and the usual definition of quotients can be viewed as a proof of the existence of a solution of the universal problem). Grading The symmetric algebra is a graded algebra. That is, it is a direct sum :S(V)=\\\\bigoplus_{n=0}^\\\\infty S^n(V), where S^n(V), called the th symmetric power of , is the vector subspace or submodule generated by the products of elements of . (The second symmetric power S^2(V) is sometimes called the symmetric square of ). This can be proved by various means. One follows from the tensor-algebra construction: since the tensor algebra is graded, and the symmetric algebra is its quotient by a homogeneous ideal, the ideal generated by all x \\\\otimes y - y \\\\otimes x, where and are in , that is, homogeneous of degree one. In the case of a vector space or a free module, the gradation is the gradation of the polynomials by the total degree. A non-free module can be written as , where is a free module of base ; its symmetric algebra is the quotient of the (graded) symmetric algebra of (a polynomial ring) by the homogeneous ideal generated by the elemens of , which are homogeneous of degree one. One can also define S^n(V) as the solution of the universal problem for -linear symmetric functions from into a vector space or a module, and then verify that the direct sum of all S^n(V) satisfies the universal problem for the symmetric algebra. Relationship with symmetric tensors As the symmetric algebra of a vector space is a quotient of the tensor algebra, an element of the symmetric algebra is not a tensor, and, in particular, is not a symmetric tensor. However, symmetric tensors are strongly related to the symmetric algebra. A symmetric tensor of degree is an element of that is invariant under the action of the symmetric group \\\\mathcal S_n. More precisely, given \\\\sigma\\\\in \\\\mathcal S_n, the transformation v_1\\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes v_n \\\\mapsto v_{\\\\sigma(1)}\\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes v_{\\\\sigma(k)} defines a linear endomorphism of . A symmetric tensor is a tensor that is invariant under all these endomorphisms. The symmetric tensors of degree form a vector subspace (or module) . The symmetric tensors are the elements of the direct sum \\\\textstyle \\\\bigoplus_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\operatorname{Sym}^n(V), which is a graded vector space (or a graded module). It is not an algebra, as the tensor product of two symmetric tensors is not symmetric in general. Let \\\\pi_n be the restriction to of the canonical surjection T^n(V)\\\\to S^n(V). If is invertible in the ground field (or ring), then \\\\pi_n is an isomorphism. This is always the case with a ground field of characteristic zero. The inverse isomorphism is the linear map defined (on products of vectors) by the symmetrization :v_1\\\\cdots v_k \\\\mapsto \\\\frac 1{n!} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma \\\\in S_k} v_{\\\\sigma(1)}\\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes v_{\\\\sigma(k)}. The map \\\\pi_n is not injective if divides the characteristic; for example \\\\pi_n(x\\\\otimes y+y\\\\otimes x) = 2xy is zero in characteristic two. Over a ring of characteristic zero, \\\\pi_n can be non surjective; for example, over the integers, if and are two linearly independent elements of that are not in , then xy ot\\\\in \\\\pi_n(\\\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V)), since \\\\frac 12 (x\\\\otimes y +y\\\\otimes x) ot\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V). In summary, over a field of characteristic zero, the symmetric tensors and the symmetric algebra form two isomorphic graded vector spaces. They can thus be identified as far as only the vector space structure is concerned, but they cannot be identified as soon as products are involved. Moreover, this isomorphism does not extend to the cases of fields of positive characteristic and rings that do not contain the rational numbers. Categorical properties Given a module over a commutative ring , the symmetric algebra can be defined by the following universal property: For every linear map from to a commutative algebra , there is a unique algebra homomorphism g:S(V)\\\\to A such that f=g\\\\circ i, where is the inclusion of in . As for every universal property, as soon as a solution exists, this defines uniquely the symmetric algebra, up to a canonical isomorphism. It follows that all properties of the symmetric algebra can be deduced from the universal property. This section is devoted to the main properties that belong to category theory. The symmetric algebra is a functor from the category of -modules to the category of -commutative algebra, since the universal property implies that every module homomorphism f:V\\\\to W can be uniquely extended to an algebra homomorphism S(f):S(V)\\\\to S(W). The universal property can be reformulated by saying that the symmetric algebra is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that sends a commutative algebra to its underlying module. Symmetric algebra of an affine space One can analogously construct the symmetric algebra on an affine space. The key difference is that the symmetric algebra of an affine space is not a graded algebra, but a filtered algebra: one can determine the degree of a polynomial on an affine space, but not its homogeneous parts. For instance, given a linear polynomial on a vector space, one can determine its constant part by evaluating at 0. On an affine space, there is no distinguished point, so one cannot do this (choosing a point turns an affine space into a vector space). Analogy with exterior algebra The Sk are functors comparable to the exterior powers; here, though, the dimension grows with k; it is given by :\\\\operatorname{dim}(S^k(V)) = \\\\binom{n+k-1}{k} where n is the dimension of V. This binomial coefficient is the number of n-variable monomials of degree k. In fact, the symmetric algebra and the exterior algebra appear as the isotypical components of the trivial and sign representation of the action of S_n acting on the tensor product V^{\\\\otimes n} (for example over the complex field) As a Hopf algebra The symmetric algebra can be given the structure of a Hopf algebra. See Tensor algebra for details. As a universal enveloping algebra The symmetric algebra S(V) is the universal enveloping algebra of an abelian Lie algebra, i.e. one in which the Lie bracket is identically 0.

Playing as a wing or fullback, he won 51 rugby union international caps for England, and in rugby league he won 12 caps for Great Britain and seven for England. Throughout his career Robinson was noted for his acceleration, side step and ability to beat defenders. Rugby league Born 30 July 1974 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Robinson began playing rugby as a child at the Hunslet Boys Club and then Hunslet Parkside before starting his rugby league career in 1991 at semi-professional side Hunslet Hawks. Despite being offered a contract by Leeds, he stuck by his club as it would have meant leaving at an inconvenient time. He was later rewarded by a contract with Wigan Warriors who went on to dominate British rugby league. His form quickly establishing him in Wigan's first team, as a teenager he was touted as a future halfback or loose forward. He was selected to play on the wing for Wigan against the visiting Brisbane Broncos in the 1992 World Club Challenge. Robinson played in Wigan's 5‚Äì4 victory over St. Helens in the 1992 Lancashire County Cup Final at Knowsley Road, St. Helens on Sunday 18 October 1992. He played and scored a try in Wigan's 15‚Äì8 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1992‚Äì93 Regal Trophy Final during the 1992‚Äì93 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 23 January 1993, played in the 2‚Äì33 defeat by Castleford in the 1993‚Äì94 Regal Trophy Final during the 1993‚Äì94 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 22 January 1994, played in the 40‚Äì10 victory over Warrington in the 1994‚Äì95 Regal Trophy Final during the 1994‚Äì95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday28 January 1995, and played in the 25‚Äì16 victory over St. Helens in the 1995‚Äì96 Regal Trophy Final during the 1995‚Äì96 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 13 January 1996. In 1993 Robinson played in his first Challenge Cup Final, with Wigan defeating Widnes. Later that year at age 19 Robinson was first selected to represent Great Britain on the wing against New Zealand. After the 1993‚Äì94 Rugby Football League season Robinson travelled with defending champions Wigan to Brisbane, playing on the wing in their 1994 World Club Challenge victory over Australian premiers, the Brisbane Broncos. It was reported in 1995 that Robinson was offered a 4-year deal worth a record ¬£1.25 million by the Australian Rugby League to play for the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the end of 1997's Super League II. He recovered from a foot injury to play in Wigan's 30‚Äì10 Challenge Cup Final victory over Leeds, scoring two tries and earning himself the Lance Todd Trophy as man-of-the-match. Robinson played for England in the 1995 World Cup Final on the wing but Australia won the match and retained the Cup. Jason Robinson In 1996, rugby union had gone open, allowing professional players for the first time, and rugby league changed from a winter sport to a summer sport, so a number of league players chose to play part of a season for a rugby union club. Robinson played for Bath. At the end of the first Super League season, Robinson was named on the wing in the 1996 Super League Dream Team. In the midst of the Super League war, Robinson played a one-off international for a 'Rest of the World' team in their 28‚Äì8 loss against the Australian Rugby League's Kangaroos in mid-1997. With his contracted move to Sydney set to take place at the conclusion of the 1997's Super League II, Robinson had had a change of heart and Wigan were able to negotiate his release from the ARL's contract so he could continue playing for his club. He then scored a try for Great Britain in each of the three matches against Australia in the post-season Super League Test series. In 1998 Robinson scored Wigan's only try in Super League's first ever Grand Final, which the Cherry & Whites won. As a result, he was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man-of-the-match. He was also named on the wing in the 1998 season's Super League Dream Team, and again in 1999 and 2000. Robinson played at fullback in the Wigan Warriors' defeat by St. Helens in the 2000 Super League Grand Final. Days after the match, it was announced that he had signed for the Zurich Premiership's Sale Sharks rugby union side, with Robinson citing the lack of anything left to prove in rugby league and the desire to represent England and Great Britain in the 15-man code. Rugby union He made his d√©but for Sale Sharks against Coventry in November 2000. In the 2005/6 season he became the first person to have won both the Guinness Premiership, and the Super League trophies. National team Robinson made his England d√©but as a substitute against Italy in February 2001, having played in the A match against Wales at Wrexham a fortnight earlier. In doing so he was only the second man ever to play rugby union for England after having first played Rugby League for Great Britain (the first having been Barrie-Jon Mather in 1999). He scored 30 tries in 56 international matches, including a try in the 2003 World Cup Final against Australia. He played in all seven of England's World Cup games in 2003. Captaincy After Lawrence Dallaglio's international retirement in 2005, Jonny Wilkinson was initially appointed captain. However, Wilkinson was injured for the 2005 autumn internationals and Robinson was appointed captain. He was the 118th captain of England, the first mixed-race player and the first former professional rugby league footballer to captain England. In his first appearance as captain, he scored a hat-trick of tries in a 70‚Äì0 rout of Canada. In the 2004 Six Nations, he scored three tries playing as a centre in the opening match against Italy and was named Man of the Match. Robinson chose to opt out of the 2004 summer tour to recover. He was captain during England's poor 2005 Six Nations campaign, in which they lost more games than they won for the first time since 1983. The Lions Robinson was chosen for the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, and was one of the outstanding players in the side that won the first Test in Brisbane 29‚Äì13. In that game he sidestepped past Australian fullback Chris Latham. He went on to score another try in the last Test. Robinson was again called up to the Lions' 2005 tour of New Zealand. He was excused from travelling with the bulk of the touring party to spend time with his wife, who was expecting the couple's fourth child in August. Throughout his career, he normally brought his wife and children along when he went on a tour, but her pregnancy made this impossible for the 2005 tour. He joined the team on 7 June, well in advance of the first New Zealand test on 25 June. International retirement Robinson playing for Sale Sharks towards the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 Guinness Premiership in which he led the club to their first Premiership title. On 24 September 2005, Robinson announced his retirement from international rugby union, stating that he wished to spend more time with his family. In the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Robinson led his club Sale Sharks to their first ever Premiership title. Return Robinson returned to the England set-up for the 2007 Six Nations tournament, following the decision of new head coach Brian Ashton to recall him to provide the leadership and winning quality the team had lacked in the past year, ending a 15-month absence from the international scene. He scored two tries on his return in England's opening victory over Scotland. He also scored another try against the Italians the following week. On 2 April 2007, Robinson announced he would retire from playing club rugby at the end of the 2006/07 season. He also announced he would participate, if required, in England's summer friendlies and the 2007 Rugby World Cup, before retiring completely from the sport. His last game for Sale Sharks came at home to Bath on Friday 13 April. Robinson said, \\"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Sale Sharks but the time has come to move on to other things. I want my last game for Sale Sharks to be a home game (v Bath) and want to be able to say a big thank you to the supporters of this great club.\\" On 13 April 2007, Robinson ended his club career with a match-winning try 6 seconds from time as Sale edged past Bath in the Guinness Premiership. In the last play of the game, he received the ball 30 metres out and could not be stopped. He was then given the opportunity to convert the try, only to miss by a matter of inches past the left post. Robinson training in 2007 On 14 September 2007, Robinson left the field to a standing ovation during England's defeat by South Africa, with a hamstring injury. This kept him out of England's remaining two group games, but he resumed full training in time to be available to play in the knock-out stages. In the quarter-final against Australia, Robinson returned to the side as full back and played his part in a tense 12‚Äì10 victory over the Wallabies. In the semi-final victory over France, his 50th cap, he was given the honour of leading out the England team. Robinson's last game for England came in the 2007 World Cup Final defeat by South Africa, when he was forced to leave the field during the second half, due to an injury. He was one of only four players to have started both the 2003 and 2007 Finals, the other three being Jonny Wilkinson, Ben Kay, and Phil Vickery. Robinson was selected to play for the Barbarians at Twickenham on 1 December 2007, showing many of his trademark runs and received a standing ovation as he left the field for the last time in the 68th minute of the match. Fylde On 26 July 2010, Robinson came out of retirement at the age of 35 to play for National League 2 North side; Fylde. He announced his final retirement on 7 July 2011. Coaching career On 5 March 2008, the RFL announced that Robinson would be returning to rugby league in a coaching capacity at grass roots level from under 8s to open age for the England national side becoming a dual code ambassador for the sport in association with Gillette. On 25 February 2009 it was announced that Robinson would be re-joining Sale Sharks as the new head coach from the 2009‚Äì10 season. Awards Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours. In March 2017, Robinson was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Lycamobile British Ethnic Diversity Sports Awards (BEDSAs) held at the London Hilton on Park Lane. Personal life He is of Scottish and Jamaican descent. His father William Thorpe, a Jamaican living in Leeds, left his mother before Robinson's birth. Robinson and his two older brothers Bernard and George were raised by his mother and a step father. In 2003, he was reunited with his natural father again through his brother and sister. Robinson is nicknamed 'Billy Whizz' after a character in the British comic The Beano, who is an extremely fast runner. Robinson divorced first wife Amanda, with whom he has six children. In June 2017 he married Sian Griffin with whom he has one son. In 2012, his eldest son Lewis Tierney, who plays as a full back, signed a two-year deal with Wigan Warriors at age 18. Tierney has declared himself for Scotland. His son Patrick is a professional cyclist. After the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Robinson wrote an autobiography entitled Finding My Feet: My Autobiography published by Coronet Books. In it, he wrote about how he overcame issues from his childhood and bouts of drinking when he found success as a rugby league star. In 2005, a biography, The Real Jason Robinson, written with Robinson's full co-operation by Dave Swanton, was published by Empire Publications.

Thus, many Shi'ites in Iraq request that they be buried in this cemetery. As a result of improved transportation methods, Shi'ites from across the globe are (or seek to be) buried in the cemetery. However, burial at the cemetery \\"means being placed in one of the cemetery‚Äôs many catacombs.\\" According to an undertaker at the cemetery, each crypt can hold up to 50 bodies. The burial plots are controlled by Marja'. The Shia traditions Maqam al-Mahdi in Wadi-us-salam Shia tradition holds that Abraham bought land in Wadi-us-Salaam and that Ali said the Wadi Al-Salaam was a part of heaven. Shia also widely believe that Ali has the power to intercede for the deceased‚Äîlessening their suffering‚Äîduring the passage of their soul from the worldly life and if they are buried there \\"they will be raised from the dead on judgment day with their spiritual leader.\\" The Shia are encouraged to bury their dead at the location through religious edicts and the cemetery's expansion is also seen as being a result of Shi'isms \\"more permissive attitude than Sunnism with regard to the commemoration of the dead and the erection of mausoleums.\\" Some rituals carried out before burial in the cemetery include: the body is washed and wrapped at the cemetery, the funeral prayers are conducted in the Imam Ali shrine, the deceased is carried around the shrine three times, and some Quranic verses are recited at the cemetery. History Daily burials have been on going for over 1,400 years and the site is on the Tentative List of UNESCO's World Heritage sites.Wadi Al-Salam Cemetery in Najaf, unesco.org. Burials in Najaf have been documented as early as the Parthian and Sassanid eras and ancient Mesopotamian cities often had similar cemeteries, where there was an accumulation of tombs. It is estimated that during the Iraq War about 200 to 250 corpses were buried there daily; however, in 2010 this number had decreased to less than 100.Najaf cemetery witness to Iraq's tragic history, usatoday.com. Approximately 50,000 new bodies are interred in the cemetery annually from across the globe. This figure is an increase on the approximately 20,000 bodies, primarily from Iran, that used to be interred annually in the early 20th century. Most Iraqi and many Iranian Shi'ites have a relative buried in the cemetery. As of 2014‚Äîcoinciding with conflict against ISIL‚Äîit has been reported that burial plots are running out, resulting in many being stolen, illegally resold or improvised.

Its proponents seek to recognize computer bugs as inevitable, and then reduce their harmful effects. The National Science Foundation funds the project. There are characteristics that set recovery oriented computing apart from all other failure handling techniques. Isolation and redundancy Isolation in these types of systems requires redundancy. Should one part of the system fail, a redundant part will need to take its place. Isolation must be failure proof for all types of failures whether they be software or human caused failures. One potential way to isolate parts of a system is using virtual machine monitors such as Xen. Virtual machine monitors allow many virtual machines to run on a physical machine and should there be a problem with one virtual machine it can be restarted without restarting the physical machine, or it can be stopped and another can take its place. System-wide undo support The ability to undo across different programs and time frames is necessary in this type of system because human error is the cause of about half of system failures. Not having undo support also limits testing aspects of a production system because it doesn‚Äôt allow for trial and error. System-wide undo support should cover all aspects of the system. This includes hardware and software upgrades, configuration as well as application management. There are obviously limits to what can be undone, and these limits are currently being explored, tested and rated based on their tradeoffs. Integrated diagnostic support Integrated diagnostic support is another characteristic a recovery-oriented computer should have. This means that the system should be able to identify the root cause of a system failure. Once it does this it should then either be able to contain the failure so it cannot affect other parts of the system or alternatively it should repair the failure. All of the system components or modules should be self-testing; it should be able to know when there is something wrong with itself. As well as determining problems with themselves, the modules should also be able to verify the behavior of other modules that they are dependent upon. The system must also track module, resource, and user request dependencies throughout the system. This will allow for containment of failures. Online verification and recovery mechanisms Recovery mechanisms are ways in which the systems can recover from failures. These recovery mechanisms should be well designed, meaning that they are reliable, effective and efficient. These systems should be proactive in testing and verifying the behavior of the recovery mechanisms so should there be a real failure it is certain that these mechanisms will do what they are designed to do and aid in the recovery of the system. These verifications should be performed even in production level equipment as this type of equipment is the most vital to have up. There are two methods for performing these tests and both of these should be used. The first method is directed tests in which the tests are set up and executed. The other method is a random test in which they occur without warning. Modularity, measurability and restartability Software aging problems are best resolved by restarting the component that is affected. This entails both modularity and restartability. Components should be restarted before they fail, and designed to make this option available or better yet, do it automatically. Applications should also be designed for restartability. Benchmarks These systems should have frequent dependability and availability benchmarking to justify their existence and usage by tracking their progress. These benchmarks should be reproducible and an impartial measure of system dependability, reliability, and availability.

It covers an area of . The geographically unified massif consists of two parts, separated by the Bregana and ≈Ωumberak rivers (Croatian: ). The northeastern part is the Samobor Hills () with the foothills. The central and western part is named ≈Ωumberak Hills (Croatian: ). Its northwesternmost part, named Gorjanci, lies in Slovenia. The highest peak of the range is Sveta Gera (Trdina Peak) on the border between Croatia and Slovenia, being high. Since 1999, an area of the range in Croatia has been protected as the nature park ≈Ωumberak‚ÄìSamobor Hills.≈Ωumberak Nature Park Location The ≈Ωumberak Mountains lie near and partly on the border between Croatia and Slovenia, which mostly passes through the highest parts of the massif. The Croatian part of the mountain range is in Central Croatia, mostly in the western part of Zagreb County, and a smaller part is in Karlovac County. The Slovene part belongs to the traditional region of Lower Carniola. The ≈Ωumberak Mountains are situated only from the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Cities near this range are Samobor, Jastrebarsko, and Ozalj in Croatia, and Novo Mesto, Bre≈æice, and Kostanjevica na Krki in Slovenia. The range is in territory of four cities: *Samobor, Novo Mesto, Jastrebarsko, and Ozalj and seven municipalities * Kr≈°ko, Kostanjevica na Krki, ≈†entjernej, Bre≈æice, ≈Ωumberak, Kra≈°iƒá, and Klinƒça Sela. Border dispute The highest peak, Sveta Gera / Trdina Peak, is subject to a border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. An old Yugoslav People's Army barracks building stands there that is used as an outpost by the Slovenian Army since the 1990s, although it is recorded in the Croatian land registry, and Croatian side see this as an occupation of their land. Since then that has been a subject of a dispute between the two new countries. The situation became more complex when the dispute nearly derailed Croatia's application to join NATO. It escalated further with Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession from December 2008 until September‚ÄìOctober 2009, when Slovenia (a European Union member state) blocked the negotiation progress of Croatia (at the time an EU candidate state). However, further escalation was prevented due to amicable diplomacy of the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers Jadranka Kosor, and Borut Pahor. Flora There are more than 1,000 species of different plant life recorded in this area, some of which are strictly protected. In the area of the Nature Park 90 species of Croatian vascular flora from the Red Book are recorded. On the global level 3 of them are critically endangered, 11 are endangered and 28 are globally sensitive. Forests cover huge area of the range. there are few Old-growth forests mostly on the Slovene part of the highest ridge, close to Sveta Gera. These are Old- growth forest Ravna Gora, and old-growth forest on Trdina Peak. Most common are the forests of sessile oak and hornbeam and on steeper slopes are the forests of Downy Oak and hop hornbeam. Beech forests cover the highest ridges. Some endangered and protected plants are found here, such as are globally sensitive species Iris croatica and Daphne blagayana. Globally sensitive species of wild orchids and lilies can be found in areas between forests and open habitats. There is only a small area of grassland of natural origin. The local population exploited grassland. Grassland are rich in species. In some areas more than 40 species of plants have been recorded on one square meter! Many of them are in the Red Book of vascular flora in Croatia. The areas of damp and marsh-like grassland and plain and moors also can be found here. Important example is the area along the Jasinje creek where even 7 strongly protected and 12 protected plant species have been recorded. Among them we stress critically endangered species on global level ‚Äì tall cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium) and alpine asphodel (Tofieldia calyculata); globally endangered species of sedges, globally sensitive species: grass-like sedge (Carex panicea) and lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and species with the status of not sufficiently explored (DD) in Croatia, elongated sedge (Carex elongata). There are 377 species of mushrooms in the Park area. It is supposed that this is only smaller number of a total number of mushrooms in this area, In the research carried on in 2007, 7 new species of mushrooms were found in ≈Ωumberak ‚Äì Samoborsko gorje Nature Park. Arched Woodwax (Hygrophorus camarophyllus) is on the Red List of the mushrooms in Croatia with EN category of endanger (globally endangered species). There are 79 discovered species of lichens, three of which are on the Red List of lichens in Croatia. These are Bryoria fuscescens (with status VU ‚Äì sensitive family), Lobaria pulmonaria (with status EN ‚Äì endangered family) and genus Usnea (status VU). The research discovered several localities rich in lichen species like wild forest of beech in area of Kuti and wider area of Budinjak, Sv. Gera. Old orchards in grassland are explored as well. Following families are found and put on the Red List of Croatia: Baeomyces rufus (almost endangered species ‚Äì NT), Dibaeis baeomyces (VU), Lobaria pulmonaria (VU), Menegazzia terebrata (VU) i Solorina saccata (VU).http://www.park- zumberak.hr/posebni/biologija.html/retrieved on 2014-04-24 File:Alpen_Edelwei√ü,_Leontopodium_alpinum_2.JPGEdelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum) File:Eriophorum angustifolium upernavik 2007-08-01 1.jpgCommon cottonsedge (Eriophorum angustifolium) File:Iris_croatica_Botanicki_vrt_1_080509.jpgIris Croatica File:Remenik.jpgDaphne blagayana File:Platanthera_bifolia_(flower).jpgLesser Butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) File:Tofieldia_calyculata_habit.jpgTofieldia calyculata Fauna Here you may see large predators as bears (Ursus arctos) and wolf (Canis lupus). There are also numerous species of small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates. There are many birds living in this area. Some are birds of prey like goshawk, and birds living next to creeks (white-throated dipper and grey wagtail). In lower parts, the grey heron (Ardea cinerea) can be found, and, occasionally, even white stork (Ciconia ciconia). Most of amphibian and reptile species which you can find in continental Croatia, can be found here. Spotted salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is a regular inhabitant of the areas near creeks. Very rare black salamanders (Salamandra atra) can be found in higher areas. Ponds are hatching places for amphibians like toads, newts and frogs. Snakes are common here.

The commonest lizard is wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), slow-worm (Anguis fragilis), European green lizard (Lacerta viridis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). There are 21 species of fish, from 8 families. They live in river Kupa, Kupƒçina, and other rivers and creeks in the area. Some of them are Eudontomyzon vladykovi, Squalius cephalus and Cobitis elongata. Brown Trout is common due to suitable ecological conditions (water temperature, quantity of oxygen and creeks' speed).Fauna; retrieved 24 April 2014. Austropotamobius torrentium, also called the stone crayfish, can be found in creeks, although very rare. There are numerous invertebrates which enrich biological diversity of the area. Many are endangered. However, due to insufficient research, not all are recorded. The most endangered is Phengaris rebeli. There are numerous species of invertebrates, in caves and holes, that have not been explored yet. There are bats as well ‚Äì the most endangered mammal. Recent exploration of karstic underground in the Park discovered some species of arthropods, which are completely new in science.

They belong to the people of Baden culture (Lasinya culture).http://www.park- zumberak.hr/posebni/povijest.html/retrieved on 2014-04-24 =Iron Age= There is a large archaeological survey in Budinjak. Large settlement and a necropolis with 140 tumuli were discovered. One of the most important findings is bronze,Kne≈æeva kaciga (Prince's Helmet), found in one of two biggest tumuli, with diameter of 19 meters . Today it is in Archaeological Museum in Zagreb. This is a proof that Budinjak was a settlement with powerful economy which had contacts with faraway lands. In late Iron Age, the Celtic tribes started conquering and colonizing this part of Europe. It is presumed that they had many settlements in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains, since mint was discovered in Samobor. Under the Okiƒá castle, in the forest of Jama near Podgraƒëe, a man found 1600 silver Celtic coins. These coins are now called Samobors. Roman period In 35 - 33 BC the ≈Ωumberak Mountains became part of the Roman Republic, later empire, province of Pannonia. The most important remains are several graveyards dating from 1st century AD found in the central ≈Ωumberak Mountains, in villages of Gornja Vas and Bratelji. People buried in those graveyards belonged to the Celtic tribe of Latobics. Many glass containers were found in these graves. These containers were produced in northern Italy, and they are proof that people in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains had a powerful economy at that time. Middle Ages After the decline of the Roman Empire, numerous Germanic and Slavic tribes passed across the Pannonian Plain. Almost nothing is known when the Croats came to the ≈Ωumberak Mountains. The earliest written texts and archaeological finds enlighten the history of the ≈Ωumberak Mountains from the 12th century on. At that time the ≈Ωumberak Mountains were the border between the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire. Early modern period Colonization of ≈Ωumberak with Vlachs and Uskoks begins 1526.Arnold Suppan, Maximilian Graf From the Austrian Empire to Communist East Central Europe, 2010, https://books.google.hr/books/about/From_the_Austrian_Empire_to_Communist_Ea.html?id=RPD_5vMCRroC&redir;_esc=y #page=58,59 Uskoks The isolated region on the Croatian side has always had a low population. In 1530, the immigration of Uskoks started, which lasted until the 17th century, which brought a large population of ≈†tokavian speakers to the region. The Uskoks in this area were led by the Deli≈°imunoviƒá family who were counts in Kostanjevac. The ≈Ωumberak Mountains were then part of Austrian Military Frontier, created by the Habsburgs to serve as a defensive buffer between their empire and the Ottoman Empire. Uskoks from this area, were the only military personnel on the Military frontier, that weren't living close to the border itself, the ≈Ωumberak Mountains themselves were an enclave within Banovina and did not directly border the Ottoman Empire, so they had to walk for half a day or longer to their posts in Ogulin, Cazin, Bihaƒá etc. 500 Uskoks from the ≈Ωumberak Mountains fought in the Battle of Sisak. They had huge losses for their standard, losing 40 soldiers in crucial mission of taking over the bridge over Odra river.http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:doc-IN5KZOA6, retrieved from dlib.si on 2014-04-23 http://www.zgodovina.eu/slovenci/bitka_pri_sisku.htmretrieved on 2014-04-23 In the year 1545. they were called by citizens of Zagreb, to defend the city from the Ottomans because the regular army under the leadership of Croatian Ban was heavily defeated in Hrvatsko Zagorje. As we know Zagreb was never occupied by the Ottomans.http://www.zumberacki-vikarijat.com/zumberacka- povijest/retrieved on 2014-04-23 =Language and religion= Because of the immigration of Uskoks, the region is the intersection of all three Croatian dialects. The descendants of Uskoks who are ≈†tokavian speakers are the majority in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains. The ≈Ωumberak Uskoks were mostly Orthodox Christians of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá, but during 17th and 18th centuries came under the Union with Rome and became Greek Catholic, so there are more Greek Catholic churches in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains than Latin Catholic churches (approx. 2 to 1). Mass emigrations Mass emigrations started in the 19th century, when Military frontier was disestablished. People in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains were no longer needed in the army. Since army salaries, which were main source of wealth, were not coming any more to the ≈Ωumberak Mountains. This was the main reason why people fell to poverty and started immigrating to the United States. World War II World War II in Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 with the invasion by Nazi Germany. Soon after that, the Croatian part of the ≈Ωumberak Mountains became a part of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany and Italy, with the western part being directly occupied by Italy. The Slovenian part was annexed directly to the Third Reich. The resistance movement in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains began when Partisans from 1st Zagreb Partisan Detachment came to this area. Matija Gubec Partisan detachment was established here in August 1941, However it was quickly destroyed. In 1942 partisans from Kordun managed to attract local people to join the resistance, so in 1942 ≈Ωumberak-Pokuplje partisan detachment was established. Later they merged with First Croatian proleterian battalion in famous XIII. proleterian brigade Rade Konƒçar. That brigade managed to liberate Kra≈°iƒá in January 1943, which was a great victory for Partisan movement, since North-West Croatia was considered to be NDH stronghold. Many villages were completely burned and destroyed by the fascists, because their inhabitants allegedly helped the partisans. ≈Ωumberak was finally liberated on 9 May 1945, by the 10th division of Yugoslav People's Army. The ≈Ωumberak Mountains are the site of the Jazovka Pit, location of a World War II massacre of retreating Ustasha soldiers and civilians mostly from hospitals in Zagreb by the communists, not partisans from ≈Ωumberak-Pokuplje partisan detachment, or local people.http://www.mojzumberak.com/Povijest__umberka/_umberak_za_vrijeme_II__svjets/_umberak_za_vrijeme_ii__svjets.html/retrieved on 2014-04-24 In SFRY In the nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies, the second mass emigration started, mostly to Germany. ≈Ωumberak-Gorjanci memorial area was established in 1971. Modern Croatia In 1991 area of the ≈Ωumberak Mountains became a part of independent Croatia and Slovenia. A military complex near the top of Trdina Peak, created by the Yugoslav People's Army, has been a subject of a dispute between the two new countries since the 1990s because it is held by the Slovenian army, but the complex is actually located on Croatian soil. Escalation was prevented due to amicable diplomacy. Both, Slovenia, and Croatia, are members of the European Union, and it is expected that Croatia will soon join Schengen area, so there will be no actual border in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains. Conservation and threats The biggest threats to the range are deforestation and illegal dumping of waste. Some argue that Kr≈°ko nuclear power plant is endangering the northern parts of the range, but it's not scientifically proven Most of the Croatian part of the range was protected as Nature park ≈Ωumberak-Samoborsko gorje by Croatian parliament Sabor, on 28 May 1999. which is since 2012.

He batted and threw right-handed. Early life Born in Valencia, Carabobo, he graduated from Pedro Gual High School where he played baseball, soccer and basketball. Playing career As a young prospect, Espinoza was let go by the Houston Astros system. But he went on to have twelve decent seasons with the Minnesota Twins (1984‚Äì1986), New York Yankees (1988‚Äì1991), Cleveland Indians (1993‚Äì1996), New York Mets (1996) and Seattle Mariners (1997). Although a free swinger, Espinoza was a good bat handler and contact hitter. His game was to simply put the ball in play and not try to hit for power. As a baserunner, he had average speed. Probably, he was not among the most gifted athletes ever to play shortstop, but he positioned himself extremely well and got to many balls that might have eluded some flashier shortstops. A sure-handed fielder, he had a strong throwing arm and found many ways to turn a double play, as well as his concentration and knowledge of the game were his main assets. In a 12-season career, Espinoza hit a .254 average with 22 home runs and 201 RBI in 942 games, including 252 runs, 105 doubles, nine triples, and 13 stolen bases. Espinoza's was one of New York Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard's favorite names to announce. He was also noted for his bubble gum hat antics, as well as other practical jokes he and teammate Wayne Kirby used to play on the 1995 Cleveland Indians. Coaching career Following his playing career after the 1997 season, Espinoza turned to coaching. In 1998, he worked with the Montreal Expos as their minor league infield coordinator. Hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, Espinoza made his managerial debut in 1999 and guided Class-A Vero Beach to a 48‚Äì85 record in the Florida State League. He spent 2000 and 2001 as the Dodgers Minor League Roving Infield Coordinator. In 2002, Espinoza was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates and then named their infield Instructor in 2004. Milestone Espinoza, Ruppert Jones‚Äö Dave Kingman‚Äö Ricky Nelson, and Jos√© Canseco are the only players to hit a fair ball that got stuck in a stadium obstruction. Jones and Nelson both had hits get caught in the overhead speakers at the old Kingdome. The balls hit by Kingman and Espinoza were at the Minneapolis Metrodome, with Kingman's getting stuck in a drainage valve and Espinoza's lodging in an overhead speaker.

However, it is now also made from other kinds of cherries. The cherries are fermented completely, including their stones.Lichine, Alexis. Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1987), p. 292. Unlike cherry liqueurs and cherry brandies, kirschwasser is not sweet. Kirsch is sometimes produced via the distillation of fermented cherry juice. The best kirschwassers have a refined taste with subtle flavors of cherry and a slight bitter-almond taste that derives from the cherry seeds. Serving Kirschwasser is usually imbibed neat. It is traditionally served cold in a very small glass and is taken as an ap√©ritif. However, people in the German-speaking region where kirschwasser originated usually serve it after dinner, as a digestif. Kirschwasser is used in some cocktails, such as the Ladyfinger, the Florida, and the Rose. High- quality kirschwasser may be served at room temperature, warmed by the hands as with brandy. Origin and production Illustration of the morello cherry Because morellos were originally grown in the Black Forest regions of Germany, kirschwasser is believed to have originated there. Kirschwasser is colourless because it is either not aged in wood or is aged in barrels made of ash. It may have been aged in paraffin-lined wood barrels or in earthenware vessels.' In France and in English-speaking countries, clear fruit brandies are known as eaux de vie. The European Union sets a minimum of 37.5% ABV (75 proof) for products of this kind; kirschwasser typically has an alcohol content of 40%‚Äì50% ABV (80‚Äì100 proof). About 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cherries go into the making of a 750 ml bottle of kirschwasser. Chemical composition Compared with brandy or whisky the characteristic features of kirsch are (a) that it contains relatively large quantities of higher alcohols and compound ethers, and (b) the presence in this spirit of small quantities of Hydrogen cyanide, partly as such and partly in combination as benzaldehyde-cyanhydrin, to which the distinctive flavour of kirsch is largely due. Food Urschwyzer kirsch, produced in Switzerland and bottled at 40% ABV Kirsch is sometimes used in Swiss fondue and in some cakes,Use of kirsch in a traditional Swiss cake such as the Zuger Kirschtorte. It is also commonly used in the dessert cherries jubilee. It is used in traditional German Schwarzw√§lder Kirschtorte (Black Forest cake) and in other cakes‚Äîfor example in Gugelhupf cake. Kirsch can also be used in the filling of chocolates. A typical kirsch chocolate consists of no more than one milliliter of kirsch, surrounded by milk or (more usually) dark chocolate with a film of hard sugar between the two parts. The hard sugar acts as an impermeable casing for the liquid content and also compensates for the lack of sweetness that is typical of kirsch. Swiss chocolatiers Lindt & Spr√ºngli and Camille Bloch, among others, manufacture these kirsch chocolates.

Novelty may be the shared experience of a new cultural phenomenon or the subjective perception of an individual. From the meaning of being unusual usage is derived the concept of the novelty dance (a type of dance that is popular for being unusual or humorous); the novelty song (a musical item that capitalizes on something new, unusual, or a current fad); the novelty show (a competition or display in which exhibits or specimens are in some way novel); and novelty architecture (a building or other structure that is interesting because it has an amusing design). It is also this sense that applies to a novelty item, a small manufactured adornment, toy or collectible. These, in turn are often used as promotional merchandise in marketing. The chess term, novelty, is used for a move in chess which has never been played before in a recorded game. The term can have pejorative sense and refer to a mere innovation. However, novelty in patent law is part of the legal test to determine whether an invention is patentable. A novelty effect is the tendency for performance to initially improve when new technology is instituted.

He also managed the band Slade and Jimi Hendrix, about whom he was regularly interviewed until his death in 1996. Early life Bryan \\"Chas\\" Chandler was born in Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne. After leaving school, he worked as a turner in the Tyneside shipyards. He became the bass player with The Alan Price Trio in 1962. The Animals After Eric Burdon joined the band, the Alan Price Trio was renamed The Animals. Chandler's bass lines were rarely given critical attention but some, including the opening riff of the group's 1965 hit \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\" subsequently received praise. Chandler was also the most prominent of the group's backing vocalists and did occasional songwriting with Burdon. In 1966, despite commercial success, Chandler became disillusioned with the lack of money, recalling that, \\"We toured non-stop for three years, doing 300 gigs a year and we hardly got a penny.\\" Jimi Hendrix and Slade After The Animals underwent personnel changes in 1966, Chandler turned to becoming a talent scout, artist manager, and record producer. During his final tour with The Animals, Chandler saw a then-unknown Jimi Hendrix play in Cafe Wha?, a Greenwich Village, New York City nightclub. At the time Hendrix was performing under the name Jimmy James. In September, Chandler convinced Hendrix to accompany him to Britain, which was made possible with the help of Michael Jeffery, who suggested that he revert to his actual name, and later suggested naming the band the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In Britain, Chandler recruited bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell as the other members of the Experience. His enthusiasm fuelled Hendrix during the early days, but halfway through the recording of his third album in 1968, Electric Ladyland, much had changed within the band's framework. Chandler was a key figure in Hendrix's rise to critical and commercial success. Chandler provided the young musician with living accommodations and financed the Experience's first single \\"Hey Joe\\", before they had a recording contract. He was also instrumental in introducing Hendrix to Eric Clapton. It was through this introduction that Hendrix was given the opportunity to play with Clapton and Cream on stage.Saunders, William (2010) Jimi Hendrix London Roaring Forties Press It was Chandler's idea for Hendrix to set his guitar on fire, which made national news when this idea was used at a concert at the Finsbury Park Astoria Theatre and subsequently at the Monterey Pop festival. Hendrix's sound engineer Eddie Kramer later recalled that Chandler was very hands-on with the first two Hendrix albums, adding that \\"he was his mentor and I think it was very necessary.\\" By 1968, Chandler had become fed up with the recording sessions for Hendrix's album Electric Ladyland, claiming they were self-indulgent. He left management services in the hands of Jeffery during the following year. Chandler then managed and produced the British rock band SladeColin Larkin, Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) p104 for 12 years, during which they achieved six number one chart hits in the UK. Chandler and Slade parted company following the failure of the \\"Knuckle Sandwich Nancy\\" single in May 1981. He would, however negotiate their RCA contract which lasted for three new albums. Expansion of music industry interests Chandler bought IBC Studios which he renamed Portland Recording Studios, after the studio address of 35 Portland Place, London and ran it for four years until he sold it to Don Arden. Chandler also ran a series of record labels from the studios including Barn Records, Six of the Best and Cheapskate Records. He formed a music publishing agency, as well as a production company and management companies. He also had a brief stint in which he produced the Philadelphia based rock group Horsepower, founded by Michael James Kennedy and Gary Marshall Marucci -EMI & island Records.-1978-1994 The Animals reunions In 1977, Chandler played and recorded with The Animals during a brief reunion and he joined them again for a further revival in 1983, at which point he sold his business interests, in order to concentrate on being a musician. During the early 1990s, he helped finance the development of Newcastle Arena, a 10,000 seat sports and entertainment venue which opened in 1995. Death Chandler died of an aortic aneurysm at Newcastle General Hospital on 17 July 1996, days after performing a solo show. Chandler's former home at 37 Second Avenue, Heaton, hosts a black plaque placed on the wall by Newcastle City Council, which reads: \\"Chas Chandler 1938‚Äì1996. Founder member of the 'Animals'. Manager of Jimi Hendrix & Slade. Co-founder of Newcastle Arena. Lived in this house 1938‚Äì1964.\\" Family Chandler had one son, Steffan, from his first marriage. He later married Madeleine Stringer, with whom he had a son, Alex, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Katherine.

He began performing as a dancer at age five, and has directed music videos and world tours for pop artists such as NSYNC and Britney Spears. Robson was the host and executive producer for The Wade Robson Project, which aired on MTV in 2003. In 2007, he joined the Fox television dance series So You Think You Can Dance as a guest judge and choreographer. Robson was befriended by singer Michael Jackson as a child. When Jackson was first charged with child sexual abuse, Robson testified at Jackson's trial, that Jackson never abused him. In 2013, he reversed that position, saying that Jackson had abused him consistently from when he was seven until he was aged fourteen. His allegations, and those of James Safechuck, are the subject of the documentary Leaving Neverland (2019). Career Early career Robson was in a talent troupe called Johnny Young's Talent School, and the group did 14 shows a week, usually at venues like shopping malls. When he was nine, Robson moved to the United States with his mother and sister. Michael Jackson assisted them in the move and recruited Robson to appear in three music videos: \\"Black or White\\", \\"Jam\\", and \\"Heal the World\\".Roth, Kristin (14 September 2000), \\"Wade Robson\\" Rolling Stone (849):120 At the age of 11, Robson had an agent.

People. 60 (12):173‚Äì174 through Epic/SME Records. The following year, he was teaching dance classes in Hollywood. He formed a troupe of dancing children, which performed internationally. He received his first choreography job for the R&B; group Immature at 14. The job led to others for artists such as Britney Spears. Clients were sometimes reluctant to take direction from Robson, a self-described \\"skinny little white kid\\". When Spears first interviewed Robson to choreograph her tour, she exclaimed, \\"He's a friggin' baby!\\"; she had expected him to be in his 30s or 40s. During the late 1990s, while still a teenager, Robson choreographed Spears's Pepsi commercials, including one which aired during the 2001 Super Bowl. He choreographed the performance by NSYNC and Spears at the 1999 Video Music Awards and he co-directed Spears's 1999‚Äì2000 world tours as well as NSYNC's 2000 No Strings Attached Tour. In 2001, he choreographed Spears' I'm a Slave 4 U video and was choreographer and director of NSYNC's 2001 PopOdyssey Tour. In the NSYNC music video \\"Pop\\", Robson had to fill in for NSYNC member Joey Fatone during several of the dance sequences because of an injury that Fatone sustained at an NSYNC concert the night before the video shoot. That same year, he directed Spears's Dream Within a Dream Tour. Robson and NSYNC's Justin Timberlake partnered in 2001, co-writing the hit singles \\"Pop\\", \\"Gone\\", and \\"See Right Through You\\" on NSYNC's final album Celebrity. Robson had initially written \\"Celebrity\\" for his own album, but was persuaded to let NSYNC record it instead. They also co- wrote Britney Spears' \\"What It's Like to Be Me\\", on which Timberlake sang backing vocals. The song's copyright is held jointly by Robson's and Timberlake's respective companies, WaJeRo Sound and Tennman Tunes.

Retrieved 31 August 2007 The choreography continues to be one of the show's more memorable group performances to date. Robson was awarded his second Primetime Emmy Award in 2008 on Season 3 of So You Think You Can Dance for the jazz routine \\"Humming Bird and the Flower\\". The performance was lauded by the show's executive producer Nigel Lythgoe, who called it \\"absolutely genius, brilliant, and one of those routines that we will remember on this series for a very long time.\\"So You Think You Can Dance, 27 June 2007 Robson and his wife Amanda were hired by Britney Spears to direct and choreograph The Circus Starring Britney Spears. When asked about working on the tour, Robson said, \\"My wife and I are co-writing it and designing it. I'll choreograph probably a third of it and I'll hire other choreographers for different sections. We're in the midst of that.\\" Rehearsals were set to begin in January 2009, however Robson and his wife were ultimately replaced by Jamie King. Spears's representatives explained that Robson was only hired to choreograph the promotional tour for Circus, which ended in Japan in December 2008. Robson choreographed the animated feature film Happy Feet Two, released in 2011. He originally was set to direct Step Up Revolution (released in 2012), but dropped out of the project for personal reasons. He was replaced by Scott Speer. Relationships General Robson dated Michael Jackson's niece Brandi, the daughter of Jackie Jackson for 7 years. Brandi states in the online Leaving Neverland counter-documentary Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary, that Robson and she met as children during a photoshoot with her uncle; Robson became attracted to Brandi and then asked Jackson to set the two up. The two were friends for ten years prior to the beginning of their relationship. Brandi also states that Robson cheated on her with Britney Spears during the latter's 1999‚Äì2001 tour, ending the pair's relationship, as well as the relationship between Spears and former boyfriend, Justin Timberlake; implying that Timberlake wrote \\"Cry Me a River\\" about Spears cheating on him with Robson. Neither Spears nor Timberlake has confirmed whether these rumors are true or not. Robson also dated dancer Mayte Garcia from 2000 until 2001. Relationship with Michael Jackson When Robson was five years old, he met Michael Jackson, who was touring Australia. Two years later, when Robson visited the US with his family to perform with Johnny Young's Talent School in Disneyland, California, Jackson invited the family to stay with him at his home, Neverland Ranch, also in California. In 2005, after Jackson was charged with child sexual abuse, Robson testified in his defense, saying he had slept in Jackson's bedroom several times but had never been molested. Jackson was acquitted. After Jackson's death in 2009, Wade said: \\"His music, his movement, his personal words of inspiration and encouragement and his unconditional love will live inside of me forever.\\" In 2013, Robson stated that Jackson had sexually abused him on two visits to the US and after he moved with his family to the US, when Robson was aged between seven and 14. Robson said his earlier denial was due to Jackson's \\"complete manipulation and brainwashing\\", and that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012. In 2015, Robson's case was dismissed by a Los Angeles judge, ruling that Robson had missed the 12-month statutory deadline after Jackson's death. The judge did not rule on the credibility of the allegations. The allegations by Robson and another man, James Safechuck, are the focus of the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland.

Trip sitter, or sometimes a sober sitter or co-pilot, is a term used by recreational or spiritual drug users to describe a person who remains sober to ensure the safety of the drug user while he or she is under the influence of a drug; they are especially common with first-time experiences or when using psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants. This practice can be qualified as a means of harm reduction. A trip sitter is sometimes called a psychedelic guide or guide, although this term is more often used to describe someone who takes an active role in guiding a drug user's experiences, while a sitter merely stands by to discourage bad trips and handle emergencies, but otherwise does not take on an active role. Guides are more common among spiritual users of entheogens. Psychedelic guides were strongly encouraged by Timothy Leary and the other authors of The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Trip sitters are also mentioned in the Responsible Drug User's Oath. Some sources recommend a sitter be present when certain drugs are used, regardless of the user's experience or comfort with the substance. A sitter may be necessary for users of Salvia divinorum for example because the drug can sometimes cause both disorientation and a desire to move about. While the presence of a responsible, knowledgeable trip sitter or guide will reduce the risks of drug use, it is of course no guarantee that a bad trip will not occur, or that the drug user will remain free of physical or mental harm. Who trip-sits In some cases, a trip sitter may be a medical professional, such as the nurses used in psychedelic research or a therapist who performs psychedelic psychotherapy. Sometimes, a tripper will ask another, more experienced user to sit for them. However, the most common trip sitter is a friend or family member whom the drug user trusts. Although an ideal sitter is one who is both personally experienced with the substance being used, as well as one trained to deal with any potential psychological or medical crisis that may arise, arguably the most important qualities may be the willingness to help, the responsibility needed to stay sober enough to be fully present, and the ability to be relaxed, accepting, and not interfere with the experience beyond the wishes of the user. A sitter should be willing to research the substance in question, and understand when to call for professional medical assistance. Especially when using a short-acting substance such as smoked DMT or Salvia divinorum, it may be possible for two people to take turns, with one being the sitter while the other takes the psychedelic. Common duties A responsible trip sitter assists a drug user before, during, and after their experience; it is their responsibility to help the user by making sure they drink enough water, assisting them in moving around when needed, and generally doing whatever necessary to ensure their comfort throughout the trip. Before use The responsible trip sitter will thoroughly research the substance which will be ingested (as well as the users) in order to answer all potential questions the user may have, and to prepare for any potential crisis situations it may cause. They may have first hand experience of the drug beforehand, but this is not required, with a number of sitters choosing to the culture but not the chemical. The sitter will discuss this research in detail with the user; it is also considered important to talk to the user about any ground rules for the session, how to handle any emergencies that may arise, and what, if any, guidance will be wanted during the trip. A trip sitter will also frequently help a drug user create a healthy set and setting for the experience. They do this by making sure the user's surroundings are comfortable and orderly, adjusting lighting, temperature, and music (if any) to suit the desired tone of the trip, and overall doing whatever they can to maximize the user's openness to the experience and minimize their fear. During the psychedelic experience A sitter typically remains present for the entire experience. In some cases, they may actively guide the experience of the user by adjusting their environment or through guided meditation or visualization. In other cases, they stay uninvolved except when the user has questions, fears, or needs for which the sitter can provide (such as making sure the user drinks enough water). Assistance in facing fears may be especially necessary if the experience turns into a bad trip. In order to maintain the immediate well-being of the drug user, it is important for the sitter to know what situations he/she can or cannot handle on his/her own, and when to call for professional medical assistance. Although the sitter may be called upon to intervene during a difficult situation, bad trip, or medical crisis, the mere presence of a caring sitter is often enough to keep a user comfortable and even enable deeper exploration of the drug's effects. The experience of being present during an especially powerful experience, such as when the user reaches new insight into themselves or their beliefs about the nature of the universe, is reportedly quite rewarding. After the trip A sitter may help the drug user to integrate or understand their experiences when the experience is complete. Just as they did before, and during the trip, they may reassure the user about any fears or worries that have occurred. This discussion may take place immediately after the drug's effects have worn off, or they may wait until a later date.

Operationally, standard troopships‚Äìoften drafted from commercial shipping fleets‚Äìcannot land troops directly on shore, typically loading and unloading at a seaport or onto smaller vessels, either tenders or barges. Attack transports, a variant of ocean-going troopship adapted to transporting invasion forces ashore, carry their own fleet of landing craft. Landing ships beach themselves and bring their troops directly ashore. History Ships to transport troops were used in Antiquity.

In the 19th century, navies frequently chartered civilian ocean liners, and from the start of the 20th century painted them gray and added a degree of armament; their speed, originally intended to minimize passage time for civilian user, proved valuable for outrunning submarines and enemy cruisers in war. even rammed and sank a U-boat during one of its wartime crossings. Individual liners capable of exceptionally high speed transited without escorts; smaller or older liners with poorer performance were protected by operating in convoys. Most major naval powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided their domestic shipping lines with subsidies to build fast ocean liners capable of conversions to auxiliary cruisers during wartime. The British government, for example, aided both Cunard and the White Star Line in constructing the liners , , and RMS Britannic. However, when the vulnerability of these ships to return fire was realized during World War I most were used instead as troopships or hospital ships. and were two of the most famous converted liners of World War II. When they were fully converted, each could carry well over 10,000 troops per trip.

A cocktail glass is a stemmed glass with an inverted cone bowl, mainly used to serve straight-up cocktails. The term cocktail glass is often used interchangeably with martini glass, despite their differing slightly. Today, the glass is used to serve a variety of cocktails, such as the Martini and its variations (French Martini, Vodka Martini, Espresso Martini, Appletini), Manhattan, Brandy Alexander, Pisco Sour, Negroni, Cosmopolitan, Gimlet, and the Grasshopper. An empty Martini Glass  History  Invented in the late 19th century, its form derives from the fact that all cocktails are traditionally served chilled and contain an aromatic element. Thus, the stem allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink, an important aspect due to the lack of added ice which in other drinks serves to cool the drink, and the wide bowl places the surface of the drink directly under the drinker's nose, ensuring the aromatic element has the desired effect. In the modern day cocktail glasses without stems are common, however, these glasses warm very quickly, a phenomenon the original stem addressed.  Martini glass  Although the terms 'cocktail glass' and 'martini glass' are often used interchangeably, the former is slightly smaller, more rounded (in contrast with the latter's purely conical shape), features a shorter stem, and a narrower rim. Despite a popular story that says the martini glass was invented during Prohibition so that in the case of a raid on a speakeasy, the large rim allowed the drink to be easily disposed of, the martini glass was formally introduced in the 1925 Paris Exhibition as a modernist take on the Champagne coupe, and wasn't originally used as it is today: in films of the 1920s it is shown to be used to hold champagne, like the coupe. However, despite the design taking influence from the geometric aesthetics of the era's architecture, interiors and furnishings, it was designed less for aesthetics and more for functionality - with the longer stem reducing the warming effect of body heat upon the contents of the glass, and the widened brim increasing surface area, supposedly allowing the gin, the main ingredient in martinis, to release its bouquet. Steeply sloping sides prevent ingredients separating, and also serve to support a toothpick or olives on a cocktail skewer. The Martini glass has somewhat fallen out of favour in modern times due to its tendency to spill drinks, and the coupe is sometimes used instead.  Sizes  A standard cocktail glass contains , though originally they were around in size. Oversized cocktail glasses, ranging in capacity from to large glasses of or more are available.

Etymology The English word antagonist comes from the Greek ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥œâŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÇ ‚Äì antagonistƒìs, \\"opponent, competitor, villain, enemy, rival,\\" which is derived from anti- (\\"against\\") and agonizesthai (\\"to contend for a prize\\"). Types Heroes and villains In the classic style of stories where the action consists of a hero fighting a villain, the two may be regarded as protagonist and antagonist, respectively. However, the villain of the story is not always the same as the antagonist, as some narratives cast the villain in the protagonist role, with the opposing hero as the antagonist. An antagonist is also sometimes a neutral character who may represent a threat or obstacle to the main character by its existence, not necessarily by targeting him or her in a deliberate manner. Antagonists are conventionally presented as making moral choices less savory than those of protagonists. This condition is often used by an author to create conflict within a story. This is merely a convention, however. An example in which this is reversed can be seen in the character Macduff from Macbeth, who is arguably morally correct in his desire to fight the tyrant Macbeth, the protagonist . Examples from television include J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) from Dallas and Alexis Colby (Joan Collins) from Dynasty. Both became breakout characters used as a device to increase their shows' ratings. Other characters Characters may be antagonists without being evil ‚Äì they may simply be injudicious and unlikeable for the audience. In some stories, such as The Catcher in the Rye, almost every character other than the protagonist may be an antagonist. Aspects of the protagonist An aspect or trait of the protagonist may be considered an antagonist, such as morality or indecisiveness. Non-personal An antagonist may not always be a person or people. In some cases, an antagonist may be a force, such as a tidal wave that destroys a city; a storm that causes havoc; or even a certain area's conditions that are the root cause of a problem. An antagonist also may or may not create obstacles for the protagonist. Societal norms or other rules also may be antagonists. Former protagonists A character once a protagonist can turn into an antagonist under extremely negative circumstances. Examples include Anakin Skywalker from the Star Wars franchise who turns from a protagonist Jedi to antagonist Sith Darth Vader. A supporting protagonist can become an antagonist by betraying a main protagonist. Usage An antagonist is used as a plot device, to set up conflicts, obstacles, or challenges for the protagonist. Though not every story requires an antagonist, it often is used in plays to increase the level of drama. In tragedies, antagonists are often the cause of the protagonist's main problem, or lead a group of characters against the protagonist; in comedies, they are usually responsible for involving the protagonist in comedic situations.

Directional Sound refers to the notion of using various devices to create fields of sound which spread less than most (small) traditional loudspeakers. Several techniques are available to accomplish this, and each has its benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, choosing a directional sound device depends greatly on the environment in which it is deployed as well as the content that will be reproduced. Keeping these factors in mind will yield the best results through any evaluation of directional sound technologies. Systems which guide evacuees during an emergency by the emission of pink noise to the exits are often also called \\"directional sound\\" systems.  Basic theory  In all wave-producing sources, the directivity of any source, at maximum, corresponds to the size of the source compared to the wavelengths it is generating: The larger the source is compared to the wavelength of the sound waves, the more directional beam results . The specific transduction method has no impact on the directivity of the resulting sound field; the analysis relies only on the aperture function of the source, per the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle. The ultrasonic devices achieve high directivity by modulating audible sound onto high frequency ultrasound. The higher frequency sound waves have a shorter wavelength and thus don't spread out as rapidly. For this reason, the resulting directivity of these devices is far higher than physically possible with any loudspeaker system. However, they are reported to have limited low-frequency reproduction abilities. See sound from ultrasound for more information.  Speaker arrays  Sound from an array spreads less than sound from a point source, by the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle applied to diffraction. While a large loudspeaker is naturally more directional because of its large size, a source with equivalent directivity can be made by utilizing an array of traditional small loudspeakers, all driven together in-phase. Acoustically equal to a large speaker, this creates a larger source size compared to wavelength, and the resulting sound field is narrowed compared to a single small speaker. Large speaker arrays have been used in hundreds of arena sound systems to mitigate noise that would ordinarily travel to adjoining neighborhoods, as well as limited applications in other applications where some degree of directivity is helpful, such as museums or similar display applications that can tolerate large speaker dimensions. Traditional speaker arrays can be fabricated in any shape or size, but a reduced physical dimension (relative to wavelength) will inherently sacrifice directivity in that dimension. The larger the speaker array, the more directional, and the smaller the size of the speaker array, the less directional it is. This is fundamental physics, and cannot be bypassed, even by using phased arrays or other signal processing methods. This is because the directivity pattern of any wave source is the Fourier Transform of the source function.Steinberg, Principles of aperture and array system design: Including random and adaptive arrays, 1976 Phased array design is, however, sometimes useful for beamsteering, or for sidelobe mitigation, but making these compromises necessarily reduces directivity. Acoustically, speaker arrays are essentially the same as sound domes, which have also been available for decades; the size of the dome opening mimics the acoustic properties of a large speaker of the same diameter (or, equivalently, a large speaker array of the same diameter). Domes, however, tend to weigh much less than the weight of comparable speaker arrays (15 lbs vs. 37 lbs, per the manufacturer's websites), and are far less expensive. Other types of large speaker panels, such as electrostatic loudspeakers, tend to be more directional than small speakers, for the same reasons as above; they are somewhat more directional only because they tend to be physically larger than most common loudspeakers. Correspondingly, an electrostatic loudspeaker the size of a small traditional speaker would be non-directional. The directivity for various source sizes and shapes is given in.Beranek, Leo L., Acoustics, Chapter 4, 1993. The directivity is shown to be a function only of the source size and shape, not of the specific type of transducer used.

Schulz. Marcie is a studious girl who is sometimes depicted as being terrible at sports. She has befriended the tomboyish, athletic Peppermint Patty, who gets annoyed at Marcie when she calls her \\"sir\\", and she has a mostly-unrequited crush on the underdog Charlie Brown. Marcie has appeared outside the comic strip, featured in numerous Peanuts television specials, cinematic films, theatrical plays, and video games. History Marcie made her first appearance in the daily strip from July 20, 1971, but her name wasn't mentioned until the strip from October 11. The character was modeled after Elise Gallaway, the roommate of Patty Swanson, Charles M. Schulz's cousin and the inspiration for the Peppermint Patty character. Marcie first appeared on television in the 1973 special There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown. A forerunner of Marcie's character, a girl named Clara, made an appearance in a sequence at a girls‚Äô camp in June 1968. As Marcie became a part of the regular cast, she appeared in the same class as Peppermint Patty, sitting in the desk behind her. In the animated special You're In the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown, Marcie's surname is given as \\"Johnson\\", but Schulz never gave her a surname in the comic strip. In the 2015 The Peanuts Movie, for which Schulz's son, Craig Schulz, and Schulz's grandson, Bryan Schulz, were included among the film's writers and producers, both had decided to include for the first time the full name of the character \\"Marcie Carlin\\", which appears on a bulletin board at the kids' school. On the test score list in the movie, the name \\"Marcie Carlin\\" is used. Marcie was a soft-spoken voice of reason to Peppermint Patty; an example of this showed in the 1973 Emmy Award winning special A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving; when Peppermint Patty throws a fit about the \\"dinner\\" Charlie Brown made for them, Marcie gently reminds her that he didn't invite her to dinner, but she invited herself. However, she is sometimes portrayed as being somewhat naive as showed It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown when Marcie showed complete ineptitude in the kitchen, making several unsuccessful attempts at preparing eggs to color for Easter, and then later biting into one without removing the shell first (saying \\"Tastes terrible, sir\\"), all to Peppermint Patty's great consternation. Later, Marcie was portrayed as an overachiever (she once quipped that she had already chosen her college and enrolled her three children in preschool) and academically the brightest of the Peanuts cast. Even so, she is possibly the most credulous and na√Øve of the gang. She apparently is under a great deal of pressure from her parents to excel in school, and, in a story in 1990, sought refuge from her demanding parents at Charlie Brown's house and fell asleep on his couch. The first actor to perform Marcie's voice in the TV specials was a boy, James Ahrens, from 1973 to 1977. Various others have played Marcie since. As with all of the Peanuts performers who were too young to read a script, director Bill Mel√©ndez sometimes had to speak the children's lines to them. Mel√©ndez (who had a distinct Mexican accent) noted with amusement that some of the performers for Marcie imitated his reading so closely, they repeated his accented \\"Charlce\\" instead of \\"Charles\\".  Appearance  Marcie wears round glasses with opaque lenses and wears her dark brown (sometimes black) hair in a short bob style. She also wears an orange t-shirt (colored red in the specials and The Peanuts Movie). She and Peppermint Patty were the only girls in the strip to wear a t-shirt and shorts (although Lucy and Sally wore pants during the winter in the 1990s‚Äô strips, and Eudora wore pants regularly). Personality Marcie is best friends with Peppermint Patty, constantly addressing her as \\"sir\\" (she called her \\"sir\\" in her first line in the strip). Originally, Peppermint Patty keeps telling Marcie to stop calling her that, but eventually grows accustomed to it. Initially, Peppermint Patty addresses Marcie as \\"dorky\\" and, when talking to others, refers to her as \\"my weird friend from camp\\". Because of the close friendship between Marcie and Peppermint Patty, some have inferred a romantic relationship between them. Marcie is in many ways the opposite of Peppermint Patty: where Peppermint Patty is more comfortable playing sports, the well-read Marcie prefers a quieter, more studious existence. Although Marcie repeatedly professes her dislike of sports, particularly baseball, she will occasionally take part in whatever sport Peppermint Patty is involved in at the time, though more often than not, Marcie, upon showing her lack of athletic prowess and lack of knowledge of the game, usually only succeeds in frustrating Peppermint Patty. Her ineptitude at sports was not consistently carried over in the prime-time animated TV specials in which the Peanuts cast was featured. In the special You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown, she proved quite capable on the athletic field, even winning the decathlon for the school. However, Schulz did not consider these to be canonical. Like Peppermint Patty, Marcie also has an unrequited crush on Charlie Brown (whom she usually calls \\"Charles\\", or occasionally \\"Chuck\\", as Peppermint Patty does); she once confessed a fondness for Charlie Brown and would be willing to marry him if he asked her. While Peppermint Patty is more likely to flirt with Charlie Brown and play mind games with him, Marcie is more frank in her admissions of her feelings, and often asks Charlie Brown in plain language if he likes her. As he does with Peppermint Patty, Charlie Brown often responds to Marcie's inquiries by trying to evade the issue -- though it appears as if he has feelings for her -- which more than once has made Marcie so angry that she kicked him in the shins in frustration. Another time she consoled him for losing the decathlon in You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown by calling him \\"a good athlete and a true gentleman\\" and lifting her glasses to wink at him (making it one of the few times her eyes were visible). She has on more than one occasion kissed Charlie Brown on the cheek. The first time was in the 1973 special There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown, but she only did it so Charlie Brown could pretend that it was a goodnight kiss from Peppermint Patty. She also kissed him in the specials Happy New Year, Charlie Brown! (1986) and He's a Bully, Charlie Brown (2006), and in \\"The Wright Brothers\\" episode of This Is America, Charlie Brown. She also kissed him in the strip in the \\"Lost Ballfield\\" story arc in 1982. Marcie and Peppermint Patty also share a crush on a boy named Pierre in the animated movie Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (And Don't Come Back!!). Although Marcie is the one in whom Pierre seems to express interest, Peppermint Patty misreads the signs and seems convinced that Pierre likes her instead. Though Marcie is usually slow to anger, she can occasionally lose her temper when provoked. Case in point, in a sequence from July‚ÄìAugust 1973, when she reluctantly joins Peppermint Patty's baseball team, she becomes the target of a male teammate named Thibault (pronounced TEE-bo), who constantly follows her around tormenting her with chauvinistic insults until she ultimately slaps him senseless. Thibault completely ignored the fact that Peppermint Patty was also a girl, though given her tomboyish nature, he may have simply been unaware. Another example from the spring of 1974 was when Peppermint Patty, in protest, refuses to go to school, holding vigil on top of Snoopy's doghouse (which Patty still refers to as Chuck's guest cottage). Eventually Marcie's anger again gets the better of her and, while pulling Peppermint Patty down, destroys the doghouse. In so doing, Marcie also makes Peppermint Patty face the reality that Snoopy is a beagle, and not the \\"funny-looking kid with the big nose\\" as Peppermint Patty often refers to him.  Voice actors  Marcie has been played by many voice actors in animated Peanuts productions. * Jimmy Ahrens (1973‚Äì1977) * Casey Carlson (1977‚Äì1981) * Shannon Cohn (1980‚Äì1982) * Michael Dockery (1983, 1985) * Keri Houlihan (1984‚Äì1986, 1988) * Jason Mendelson (1986) * Tani Taylor Powers (1988) * Marie Cole (1989) * Lindsay Benesh (1992) * Nicole Fisher (1994‚Äì1997) * Ashley Edner (2000) * Jessica D.

A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens a biological response by binding to and blocking a receptor rather than activating it like an agonist. Antagonist drugs interfere in natural works of receptor protein.\\"Pharmacology Guide: In vitro pharmacology: concentration- response curves.\\" GlaxoWellcome. Retrieved on December 6, 2007. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist‚Äìreceptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist‚Äìreceptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors. Etymology The English word antagonist in pharmaceutical terms comes from the Greek ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥œâŒΩŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÇ ‚Äì antagonistƒìs, \\"opponent, competitor, villain, enemy, rival\\", which is derived from anti- (\\"against\\") and agonizesthai (\\"to contend for a prize\\"). Receptors Biochemical receptors are large protein molecules that can be activated by the binding of a ligand such as a hormone or a drug.T. Kenakin (2006) A Pharmacology Primer: Theory, Applications, and Methods. 2nd Edition Elsevier Receptors can be membrane-bound, as cell surface receptors, or inside the cell as intracellular receptors, such as nuclear receptors including those of the mitochondrion. Binding occurs as a result of non- covalent interactions between the receptor and its ligand, at locations called the binding site on the receptor. A receptor may contain one or more binding sites for different ligands. Binding to the active site on the receptor regulates receptor activation directly. The activity of receptors can also be regulated by the binding of a ligand to other sites on the receptor, as in allosteric binding sites. Antagonists mediate their effects through receptor interactions by preventing agonist-induced responses. This may be accomplished by binding to the active site or the allosteric site. In addition, antagonists may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity to exert their effects. The term antagonist was originally coined to describe different profiles of drug effects. The biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist was introduced by Ariens and Stephenson of the original article. in the 1950s. The current accepted definition of receptor antagonist is based on the receptor occupancy model. It narrows the definition of antagonism to consider only those compounds with opposing activities at a single receptor. Agonists were thought to turn \\"on\\" a single cellular response by binding to the receptor, thus initiating a biochemical mechanism for change within a cell. Antagonists were thought to turn \\"off\\" that response by 'blocking' the receptor from the agonist. This definition also remains in use for physiological antagonists, substances that have opposing physiological actions, but act at different receptors. For example, histamine lowers arterial pressure through vasodilation at the histamine H1 receptor, while adrenaline raises arterial pressure through vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptor activation. Our understanding of the mechanism of drug-induced receptor activation and receptor theory and the biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist continues to evolve. The two-state model of receptor activation has given way to multistate models with intermediate conformational states. The discovery of functional selectivity and that ligand-specific receptor conformations occur and can affect interaction of receptors with different second messenger systems may mean that drugs can be designed to activate some of the downstream functions of a receptor but not others. This means efficacy may actually depend on where that receptor is expressed, altering the view that efficacy at a receptor is receptor-independent property of a drug. Pharmacodynamics Efficacy and potency By definition, antagonists display no efficacy to activate the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures the effect of the ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects. Affinity The affinity of an antagonist for its binding site (Ki), i.e. its ability to bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression can be used to determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists. Types Competitive Competitive antagonists bind to receptors at the same binding site (active site) as the endogenous ligand or agonist, but without activating the receptor. Agonists and antagonists \\"compete\\" for the same binding site on the receptor. Once bound, an antagonist will block agonist binding. Sufficient concentrations of an antagonist will displace the agonist from the binding sites, resulting in a lower frequency of receptor activation. The level of activity of the receptor will be determined by the relative affinity of each molecule for the site and their relative concentrations. High concentrations of a competitive agonist will increase the proportion of receptors that the agonist occupies, higher concentrations of the antagonist will be required to obtain the same degree of binding site occupancy. In functional assays using competitive antagonists, a parallel rightward shift of agonist dose‚Äìresponse curves with no alteration of the maximal response is observed. Competitive antagonists are used to prevent the activity of drugs, and to reverse the effects of drugs that have already been consumed. Naloxone (also known as Narcan) is used to reverse opioid overdose caused by drugs such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, Ro15-4513 is an antidote to alcohol and flumazenil is an antidote to benzodiazepines. Competitive antagonists are sub-classified as reversible (surmountable) or irreversible (insurmountable) competitive antagonists, depending on how they interact with their receptor protein targets.. Reversible antagonists, which bind via noncovalent intermolecular forces, will eventually dissociate from the receptor, freeing the receptor to be bound again.Stevens, E. (2013) Medicinal Chemistry: The Modern Drug Discovery Process. pg. 79, 84 Irreversible antagonists bind via covalent intermolecular forces. Because there is not enough free energy to break covalent bonds in the local environment, the bond is essentially \\"permanent\\", meaning the receptor-antagonist complex will never dissociate. The receptor will thereby remain permanently antagonized until it is ubiquitinated and thus destroyed. Non-competitive A non-competitive antagonist is a type of insurmountable antagonist that may act in one of two ways: by binding to an allosteric site of the receptor, or by irreversibly binding to the active site of the receptor. The former meaning has been standardised by the IUPHAR, and is equivalent to the antagonist being called an allosteric antagonist. While the mechanism of antagonism is different in both of these phenomena, they are both called \\"non-competitive\\" because the end-results of each are functionally very similar. Unlike competitive antagonists, which affect the amount of agonist necessary to achieve a maximal response but do not affect the magnitude of that maximal response, non-competitive antagonists reduce the magnitude of the maximum response that can be attained by any amount of agonist. This property earns them the name \\"non-competitive\\" because their effects cannot be negated, no matter how much agonist is present. In functional assays of non-competitive antagonists, depression (physiology) of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves, and in some cases, rightward shifts, is produced. The rightward shift will occur as a result of a receptor reserve (also known as spare receptors) and inhibition of the agonist response will only occur when this reserve is depleted. An antagonist that binds to the active site of a receptor is said to be \\"non-competitive\\" if the bond between the active site and the antagonist is irreversible or nearly so. This usage of the term \\"non-competitive\\" may not be ideal, however, since the term \\"irreversible competitive antagonism\\" may also be used to describe the same phenomenon without the potential for confusion with the second meaning of \\"non-competitive antagonism\\" discussed below. The second form of \\"non- competitive antagonists\\" act at an allosteric site. These antagonists bind to a distinctly separate binding site from the agonist, exerting their action to that receptor via the other binding site. They do not compete with agonists for binding at the active site. The bound antagonists may prevent conformational changes in the receptor required for receptor activation after the agonist binds.D.E. Golan, A.H Tashjian Jr, E.J. Armstrong, A.W. Armstrong. (2007) Principles of Pharmacology: The Pathophysiologic Basis of Drug Therapy Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Cyclothiazide has been shown to act as a reversible non-competitive antagonist of mGluR1 receptor. Uncompetitive Uncompetitive antagonists differ from non-competitive antagonists in that they require receptor activation by an agonist before they can bind to a separate allosteric binding site. This type of antagonism produces a kinetic profile in which \\"the same amount of antagonist blocks higher concentrations of agonist better than lower concentrations of agonist\\". Memantine, used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor. Silent antagonists Silent antagonists are competitive receptor antagonists that have zero intrinsic activity for activating a receptor. They are true antagonists, so to speak. The term was created to distinguish fully inactive antagonists from weak partial agonists or inverse agonists. Partial agonists Partial agonists are defined as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists can act as a competitive antagonist in the presence of a full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone.Principles and Practice of Pharmacology for Anaesthetists By Norton Elwy Williams, Thomas Norman Calvey Published 2001 Blackwell Publishing Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. E.g. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the Œº-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence. Inverse agonists An inverse agonist can have effects similar to those of an antagonist, but causes a distinct set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists. Reversibility Many antagonists are reversible antagonists that, like most agonists, will bind and unbind a receptor at rates determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the receptor target and, in general, cannot be removed; inactivating the receptor for the duration of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker‚Äîit permanently binds to Œ± adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored. Irreversible competitive antagonists also involve competition between the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, there may be a distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration‚Äìeffect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.

Since July 2019, it is part of the town Ingelheim am Rhein. It was the administrative seat of the former Verbandsgemeinde of Heidesheim am Rhein, which also included the Ortsgemeinde of Wackernheim. Heidesheim was one of the biggest municipalities in Rhenish Hesse.  Geography   Location  Heidesheim lies in northern Rhenish Hesse, on the so-called Rhine Knee, west of the state capital, Mainz. The municipal area reaches in the north up to the middle of the Rhine's navigational lane, which here reaches one of its greatest breadths, comprising even the K√∂nigsklinger Aue (an island, although its name identifies it as a floodplain). At the bank behind the floodwall, at an elevation of some 82 m, it abuts a sandy plain which is used especially for growing asparagus and which is also covered in fruit trees. Just behind the floodwall is the outlying centre of Heidenfahrt. From here, before the channelling work on the Mariannenaue (floodplain) was broadened towards the east, there was once a ferry link to Erbach. The community core of Heidesheim itself lies some 2 km from the Rhine's banks, in a location safe from floodwaters at the foot of the Rhenish Hesse hill country. The municipal area stretches on from there up the north slope of these hills, reaching 2 km east of the municipality's centre an elevation of 207 m above sea level. Wherever gaps in the fruit trees allow it, there is a broad view over the Rhine into the Rheingau, all the way to the western part of the Taunus‚Äôs main ridge, the Rheingau Range (Rheingaugebirge) with the Kalte Herberge and the Hallgarter Zange (mountains) as its highest elevations in the centre. In the east, near Uhlerborn, on the boundary with Budenheim, Heidesheim has a share of one of Rhenish Hesse's few wooded areas. As of late 2006 Heidesheim has a population of 7,195, and covers and area of 17.56 km¬≤.  Constituent communities  Heidesheim's Ortsteile are Heidesheim, Heidenfahrt and Uhlerborn.  Neighbouring municipalities  Clockwise from the north, these are Eltville am Rhein (on the Rhine's right, or north, bank), Budenheim, Mainz‚Äôs outlying centres of Gonsenheim and Finthen, the Verbandsgemeinde of Nieder-Olm, the Verbandsgemeinde of Gau- Algesheim and the town of Ingelheim  History  Many finds from prehistory and early historical times confirm that Heidesheim am Rhein's municipal area was settled as early as the New Stone Age (5500 to 2200 BC). Most have been chance finds.Bernhard St√ºmpel, Aus Ur- und Fr√ºhgeschichte der Gemarkung Heidesheim, in: Gemeinde Heidesheim, Hrsg., Festschrift zur 1200-Jahr-Feier von Heidesheim, Gau-Algesheim 1962, S. 9-16. In Roman times, north of today's community core, stood an extensive villa rustica, which was forsaken after the Germanic invasions in the early 5th century. Within its walls was built Saint George's Chapel (Sankt Georgskapelle), around which, after the mid 7th century, Frankish settlers came to live. The municipality's name is said to go back to an estate owned by a Frankish nobleman called Heisino.Franz Joseph Spang, Das geschichtliche Werden von Heidesheim, in: Festschrift 1962 (wie Anm. 1) S. 18-31 bes. S. 21. The place had its first documentary mention as Heisinisheim or Hasinisheim in donations to the Lorsch Abbey, the earliest of which purports to date from 762, although in actuality it can only be traced back to some time between September in one of the years between 765 and 768.Karl Gl√∂ckner, Bearb. u. Hrsg., Codex Laureshamensis, Bd. 2: Kopialbuch, Teil 1: Oberrhein-, Lobden-, Worms-, Nahe- und Speiergau, Darmstadt 1933 (= Arbeiten der Historischen Kommission f√ºr den Volksstaat Hessen), S. 406 Nr. 1436. - Generaldirektion der Staatlichen Archive Bayerns und Kuratorium Weltkulturdenkmal Kloster Lorsch e.V., Hrsg., Codex Laureshamensis, Urkundenbuch der ehemaligen F√ºrstabtei Lorsch, Faksimileausgabe der Handschrift im Staatsarchiv W√ºrzburg, Bd. 1: Faksimile, Neustadt a. d.

The earliest confirmed date is 5 July 768.Gl√∂ckner (wie Anm. 4) S. 405 Nr. 1429. - Codex Laureshamensis (wie Anm. 4) fol. 112r Sp. 1. All together, the Lorsch codex catalogues ten endowments for the Lorsch Abbey in Heidesheim between 765 or 768 and 794,Gl√∂ckner (wie Anm. 4) S. 405 ff. Nr. 1429-1438. - Codex Laureshamensis (wie Anm. 4) fol. 112r Sp. 1 f. of which however none crops up in later documents. This circumstance leads to the inference that Lorsch had already traded or sold its holdings in Heidesheim by the time the Codex was transferred to parchment between 1183 and 1195. A wider array of documents referring to Heidesheim only comes to light about 1150. The Altm√ºnster Abbey at Mainz then had at its disposal extensive landholdings and half the tithes. Whether these stemmed from the Rhine Counts (Rheingrafen), as one always reads,As in Ernst Krebs, Zur Geschichte von Heidesheim, in: M√§nner- Gesang-Verein \\"Einigkeit\\" Heidesheim, Hrsg., Festschrift zur Fahnenweihe verbunden mit Wertungssingen am 4., 5. und 6. Juli 1925, Gau-Algesheim o.J. (1925) S. 5-33 bes. S. 10. has yet to be confirmed. Besides this, in 1145, the first holding in Walsheim (a vanished village near Heidenfahrt) passed to Eberbach Abbey, laying the groundwork for the Sandhof (see Culture and sightseeing: Buildings below). Eventually, in 1158, the Lords of Winternheim were mentioned, who later named themselves after the castle, Burg Windeck, as the Lords of Winterau. Besides these three parties, who dominate the historical records, other Mainz monastic foundations and resident families held lands and rights here. While the Lords of Winternheim began work on Burg Windeck in the earlier half of the 12th century, the actual settlement around Saint George's Chapel apparently remained unfortified, or at least not amply so: when Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was getting himself ready in 1200 to build Mainz's city wall up again after it had been razed on Emperor Friedrich I's orders in 1163, he obliged many villages in the outlying countryside to build their own respective sections. The Heidesheim dwellers had to contribute, arm and maintain five merlons, for which they enjoyed protection, defence, market rights and free buying and selling in the city.Schaab I S. 188. - Krebs, Festschrift 1925, S. 10 f. - Quelle: Bodmann, Rhein. Alterth. I S. 23; vgl. auch Mainzer UB II 2 S. 1157 f. Nr. 709. Besides landholdings and income, Altm√ºnster had the Heidesheim Vogtei and thereby sovereign rights over the village. Over the course of the centuries, the Vogtei passed through many holders‚Äô hands: That it was held after 1250 by the Lords of Biegen, who gave it back to Altm√ºnster on 13 February 1285Karl Anton Schaab, Geschichte der Stadt Mainz, Bd. 3: Geschichte der Gro√üherzoglich Hessischen Rheinprovinz I. Abtl., Mainz 1847, S. 454 f. is clearly not so. The relevant document refers not to Heidesheim, but rather to Hattenheim in the Rheingau.Wilhelm Sauer, Nassauisches Urkundenbuch I 2, Wiesbaden 1886, S. 614 f. Nr. 1043 Against this is that the Abbey appointed Werner von Winterau and his male heirs village V√∂gte on 31 January 1326.Schaab (wie Anm. 11) III S. 455 (irrig zu 1326 Februar 2) The lordly house of Winterau died out before 12 April 1372, on which day a Wilhelm von Scharpenstein was avouched as Vogt.Ludwig Baur, Hrsg., Hessische Urkunden, Bd. 3: Rheinhessen 1326-1399. Nachtr√§ge zu allen 3 Provinzen 1133-1335, Darmstadt 1863 (Nachdruck Aalen 1979), S. 455 ff. Anm. From him the Vogtei passed on 14 July 1385 in inheritance along the male line to Dietrich Huth von Sonnenberg.Schaab III S. 455 On 17 January 1414, the Archbishop of Mainz John II of Nassau documented that the abbess and convent of Altm√ºnster at Mainz had transferred one third of the court at Heidesheim to the Archbishopric. Outside this arrangement were the Vogtei with all its appurtenances, the income and the landholdings that were part of the convent's estate. This was confirmed in writing to the convent for all time by the Archbishop with the cathedral deacon's and the cathedral capitular's consent. Moreover, Altm√ºnster was henceforth to be freed of all contributions and levies imposed by the Archbishop or the cathedral capitular. Both pledged henceforth to protect and defend the convent with all its holdings and rights ‚Äì particularly the remaining two thirds of the court at Heidesheim Der Mainzer und Magdeburger Erzbischof Kardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg best√§tigte die Verf√ºgung seines Vorg√§ngers am 22. Oktober 1522.Schaab III S. 456. Such deals, under which Mainz ecclesiastical and monastic foundations yielded sovereign rights, which they could hardly assert through their own power, to the Archbishop against assurance and protection of their ownership rights were often struck in the time that followed.Wilhelm Fabricius, Erl√§uterungen zum geschichtlichen Atlas der Rheinprovinz, Bd. 6: Die Herrschaften des unteren Nahegebietes, der Nahegau und seine Umgebung, Bonn 1914 (= Publikationen der Gesellschaft f√ºr rheinische Geschichtskunde, Bd. 12/6), S. 44 In Heidesheim's case, this transfer led to the Archbishop's Amtmann appearing alongside the Altm√ºnster convent's Vogt. Men known to have served as Archiepiscopal Amtm√§nner after 1414 on are, in 1481 Johann Langwerth von Simmern, and from 1565 to 1584 Mainz cathedral cantor Heinrich von Stockheim. Known V√∂gte from that same time are, from 1468 to 1489 Philipp von Stockheim, and from 1489 to 1524 Count Emmerich of Nassau and his male heirs, from 1524 to 1537 Ritter (‚ÄúKnight‚Äù, or perhaps ‚ÄúSir‚Äù) Rabe von Liebenstein, from 1537 to 1553 Hans Sifrid vom Oberstein, and from 1553, first Konrad, and then Hans Georg von Bicken. That the Amtmann and Vogt often annoyed each other can be seen in two trials fought by Heinrich von Stockheim and Hans Georg von Bicken before the Imperial Chamber Court.Bayerisches Staatsarchiv W√ºrzburg When Hans Georg von Bicken found out that he would keep being denied inheritance along the male line, he asked Archbishop of Mainz Wolfgang von Dalberg on 10 November 1598 to change the Heidesheim Vogtei, which had been transferred to him and his cousins as a non-heritable fief, into a heritable fief. His request was never answered.Bayerisches Staatsarchiv W√ºrzburg M.R.A.-K.727/Stifte 2377. Thus, when he died about 1608, the Vogtei passed back to Altenm√ºnster. The convent seized the day: On advice that in these hard times they could no longer fulfil the demands that the remaining two thirds of the sovereign rights in Heidesheim required of them, the abbess and convent offered the Elector this two-thirds share. In return, the Archbishop ‚Äì as had been done in 1414 and 1522 ‚Äì was to protect holdings, rights and income in the village. The Archbishop accepted the transfer with the specified conditions on the very same day, which suggests that the matter had been being discussed for quite some time. The year 1609 was a watershed in the municipality's history. Altenm√ºnster now only held patronage rights at Saint Philip's and Saint James's Parish Church; the convent could still suggest priests and bellringers, who had to be confirmed by the Archbishop. Furthermore, in spiritual matters, the archiepiscopal vicariate general was responsible, while in worldly matters Heidesheim was under an Electoral deputy. The offices of monasterial Vogt and Electoral Amtmann were forgone. Eventually, the Electoral Chamber gave out Windeck Castle ‚Äì until then the Amtmann‚Äôs seat ‚Äì as a heritable asset.

The chapel's roughly 1,500-year building history has led to its beginnings being uncovered only bit by bit: Long were those sought ‚Äì not least of all because of Bishop Sidonius's patronage ‚Äì in Frankish times.Fritz Arens, Heidesheimer Kunstdenkm√§ler, in: Mitteilungsblatt zur rheinhessischen Landeskunde 4 (1955) S. 128; Rita Otto, Zur Datierung der Kirche des heiligen Georg in Heidesheim, in: Heimat-Jahrbuch Landkreis Bingen 13 (1969) S. 36-39. According to more recent investigations, one may presume that there was ‚Äúin it a late-Antiquity country church‚Äù of the Bishop of Mainz, that not least of all because of that can be acknowledged ‚Äúas an especially vital centre of Roman-Christian tradition‚Äù.Staab (wie Anm. 4) S. 143.

Their descendants expanded the chapel in the late 10th and early 11th century with an apse; at this time the triumphal arch imposts were built in. Further expansions came about 1200 ‚Äì from this time may stem the consecrational inscription on the lintel of the walled-up door on the south fa√ßade: ‚ÄúGEWEIHT AM 23.

At this time, Saint George's was the parish church. Saint George's and its parish priest held title to a fourth of all incoming tithes in Heidesheim. From the Middle Ages two documents are known in which Saint George's Chapel is mentioned. Both stem from documents that have come down from the Eberbach Monastery, and both deal with whether the Sandhof owed the priest the aforesaid tithe. While Provost Otto von Mariengreden could claim his entitlement between April and June from 1185 to 1196 as Heidesheim's priest,Peter Acht, Bearb., Mainzer Urkundenbuch, Bd. 2 Teil 2: 1176-1200.

Once the village had been moved from the Rhine Plain onto the slope of the Dinkberg and Saint Philip's and Saint James's Parish Church had been built, Saint George's Chapel lost its status as parish church, although it was not thereby forsaken. Rather, at roughly the same time, the apse was replaced with an enclosed quire. In the 15th century came further extensive conversions.Krenke (wie Anm. 4) S. 324. That pilgrimages had begun as early as the Middle Ages is made plain by later accounts.  Modern times  After the Thirty Years' War, Saint George's Chapel was held by Imperial Baron Philipp Erwein von Sch√∂nborn (d. 1668), who moved his family's landholdings from the Taunus to the Middle Rhine and the Main. He acquired it because of the Altm√ºnster Convent's fourth of the tithes that were tied to it, of which sometime earlier ‚Äì the exact circumstances are still unclear ‚Äì Heidesheim's parish priest had been stripped by the Convent, which was furthermore towards the end of, or just after, the Thirty Years' War ‚Äì as almost always ‚Äì in need of money. The priest's livelihood was later disputed by the Convent, making his financial position anything but better. In a description of the municipality put together by a Heidesheim priest between 1667 and 1677 and found in Johann Sebastian Severus's (d. 1797) Dioecesis Moguntina, it says of Saint George's Chapel: > ‚ÄúAlso standing on the field of Heidesheim is a chapel of Saint George, built > in the beginning as a building with mean stonework, later expanded because > of the crowd of pilgrims streaming there and manifestly hallowed. ‚Ä¶ After > Saint George‚Äôs feast here in the village is, as ever, festively celebrated, > the local community proceeds there in a festive Rogation procession and > attend festive Mass and sermon.

The Heidesheim dwellers kept true to Saint George's Chapel through the centuries: when it was being rebuilt in 1665 they transported the lumber from the Rhine to the chapel and set it up there. And when the chapel burnt down again in 1776, Father Michael Priester pressed for the archiepiscopal vicariate general to work towards getting the Count of Sch√∂nborn to build it anew.Ernst Krebs, Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Heidesheimer Kirchen und Kapellen und ihrer Pfarrer a) St. Georgskirche, in: Nachrichtenblatt der Gemeinden Heidesheim und Wackernheim 9. Jg. Nr. 26 vom 29. M√§rz 1934. Witnessing the church's Baroque d√©cor is a statue of Saint George, which today is kept in the Heidesheim Catholic parish hall. Saint George's Chapel When France annexed the Rhine's left bank in 1797, Saint George's Chapel passed to the state. The tithes were abolished, and the pilgrimages suspended. When it was announced that the job of tearing the chapel down was to be auctioned to the highest bidder, the Heidesheim dwellers sprang to the chapel's defence: The president of the church board, the mayor and the parish priest asked the prefect of the department of Donnersberg, Jeanbon St. Andr√©, to relinquish Saint George's Chapel to the Church. The motion was granted.Krebs (wie Anm. 11) Thereafter it became still around Saint George's Chapel. In the legendary handbook by Georg Dehio, the reader seeks it in vain.Georg Dehio, Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler, Bd. 4: S√ºdwestdeutschland. Im Anhang Elsa√ü- Lothringen und die Deutsche Schweiz, 2. Aufl. Berlin 1926, S. 133. And in 1934, Ernst Krebs wrote: > ‚ÄúThus now still stands Saint George‚Äôs sanctuary so lonely and forlorn there > below as it did hundreds of years ago, and if one enters the church‚Äôs humble > interior, one feels in this room as if sent back to a vanished time and only > a train abruptly roaring by destroys the illusion and recalls the gap that > divides the beginnings of the old place of worship from the present. Even in the new edition of Dehio's handbook supplied by Ernst Gall, Saint George's Chapel is missing.Georg Dehio, Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler, neu bearb. v.

The public esteem for the oldest and most important building in Heidesheim that has been steadily growing since then is something for which the Heidesheim Saint George's Chapel Promotional Association (F√∂rderverein St. Georgskapelle Heidesheim e.V. ), above all, is to be thanked. Since 1984 it has tirelessly set itself to restoring the building. Today the chapel looks to be in a worthy state both inside and outside, although there is yet much work to be done. It is once again being used for church services. In the coming years, the Association will be undertaking digs in the area around the chapel and thereby promoting the scientific opening of the Roman villa rustica and the Frankish settlement bound up with it. = Windeck Castle =  The Lords of Winternheim and Lords of Winterau  Windeck Castle (Burg Windeck) lies in the municipality's north, south of the railway station. For centuries it stood on the village's northern edge ‚Äì whence its name Wintereck or Windeck (Ecke means ‚Äúcorner‚Äù or ‚Äúedge‚Äù ‚Äì and is cognate with the latter ‚Äì in German). The widely held notion that the castle was built in or about the year 1209 is something that needs to be set right. Herdegen I of Winternheim might have built the four-sided defensive tower in the middle before 1150.Christian Rauch, Die Kunstdenkm√§ler des Kreises Bingen, Geschichtliche Beitr√§ge von Fritz Herrmann, Zeichnungen von Ludwig Greb und Carl Bronner, Darmstadt 1934 (= Die Kunstdenkm√§ler im Volksstaat Hessen, Provinz Rheinhessen, Kreis Bingen) S. 333-358 bes.

S. 33 zufolge ist die Windeck der √§lteste der hessischen Wohnt√ºrme, ohne dass er sich auf ein Datum festlegen w√ºrde. The arbitrary ruling from 1209, on the other hand, mentions ‚Äúlands and buildings‚Äù that his like-named son, Herdegen II, ‚Äúhas taken away from the Brothers of Eberbach in Heidesheim and upon which he has built his house‚Äôs wall and moat‚Äù.... ut memoratus H pro areis et edificiis, que fratribus de Eberbach in Heisensheim abstulerat, in quibus etiam murum et fossatum sue domus locarat, ...

S. 171. In 1209, then, it was a castle zone expansion that was being discussed; the castle itself was already standing. A notice from the years 1211 to 1234 shows that there was a further castle zone expansion. At that time, Herdegen ‚Äì most likely a son of Herdegen II, and thereby the third who went by this name ‚Äì and a man named Embricho ‚Äì possibly this Herdegen's brother ‚Äì from Eberbach Monastery ‚Äúthe part of a vineyard on which they built their castle‚Äôs moat‚Äù.Nos vero dedimus eis (i.e. Embricho et Herdegeno) particulam vinee, in qua fecerant fossatum castri sui. (Meyer zu Ermgassen II (wie Anm. 2) S. 183 ¬ß 56. Windeck might have looked much as Karl Bronner has reconstructed it no later than that: in the centre the four-sided tower with entrance and wooden parapet eight metres high, girded by an inner wall with a moat and an outer wall, through which flowed either the S√ºlzbach or the flood channel.Bronner (wie Anm. 1) S. 34 mit Tafel III. Between the walls stood living and working buildings. The core may only have served as a refuge, as suggested by the tower's limited land area and its difficult access. Whether the Lords of Winternheim came from Gro√ü- Winternheim or Klein-Winternheim cannot be answered without further investigation. In 1235 they were named for the first time as the Lords of WinterauRichard Dertsch, Die Urkunden des Stadtarchivs Mainz, Bd. 1, Mainz 1962 (= Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Stadt Mainz, Bd. 20 Teil 1) S. 34 Nr. 77. and thereby by the name that they bore in the time that followed. Father Hermann B√§r has carefully uttered the assumption hitherto held up as certainty that the Lords‚Äô estate before the middle of the 13th century passed by way of a daughter of the house temporarily to the Lords of Leien.P. Hermann B√§r's Diplomatische Geschichte der Abtei Eberbach im Rheingau.

In so doing he refers to a document by which the brothers Philipp, Friedrich and Heinrich of Leien ceded for themselves and their heirs all rights at the Sandhof to Eberbach Monastery, which for its part forwent all levies that it had imposed on them and their father.Ludwig Baur, Hrsg., Hessische Urkunden, Bd. 3: Rheinhessen 1326-1399, Nachtr√§ge zu allen 3 Provinzen 1133-1335, Darmstadt 1863 (Neudruck Aalen 1979) S. 594 Nr. 594 f. Nr. 1527. Hermann B√§r and those who follow him, though, have something working against them: First, it is unclear whether in the document in questionHessisches Staatsarchiv Darmstadt, Best. A 2 Nr. 208/1. it actually says milites in Leien, as it might rather be a question of an abbreviation mark over one of the I's, which would yield milites in Leheim instead. Thus it is with a later remark on the back of the document. Therefore, it has not been determined what rights the document was dealing with at all. Whatever the truth, the Lords of Winterau had already ceded the Vogtei rights that they had held over nine and a half Hufen of the Sandhof to the monks of Eberbach in 1209.Karl Rossel, Hrsg., Urkundenbuch der Abtei Eberbach im Rheingau, Bd. 1, Wiesbaden 1862, S. 134-137 Nr. 68; vgl. auch Baur III (wie Anm. 7) S. 403 ff.

Nr. 343. The Lords of Winterau owned and lived at Windeck Castle from their beginnings before 1150 up until the family died out in the latter half of the 14th century. In 1326 the Convent of Altm√ºnster at Mainz enfeoffed them with its Vogtei in Heidesheim.Karl Anton Schaab, Geschichte der Stadt Mainz, Bd. 3: Die Geschichte der Gro√üherzoglich Hessischen Rheinprovinz, 1. Abtl., Mainz 1847, S. 455. In a judgment from 12 April 1372, Wilhelm von Scharpenstein is named as Vogt of the court of Heidesheim and a hern Wernher selgen von Wynthirauwe is named as his neighbour.Richard Dertsch, Die Urkunden des Stadtarchivs Mainz, Regesten, Bd. 3: 1365 bis 1400, Mainz 1965 (= Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Stadt Mainz, Bd. 20 Teil 3), S. 66 f. Nr. 1921. The word selgen there means ‚Äúlate‚Äù ‚Äì the House of Winterau was no more.  15th to 20th century  To whom Windeck Castle passed once the Lords of Winterau were gone is shrouded in darkness. Perhaps it ended up with the Altm√ºnster Convent, which might then have passed it on in 1414, together with a third of the Heidesheim court, to Archbishop of Mainz John II of Nassau. In 1481, the archiepiscopal Amtmann of Heidesheim, Johann Langwert von Simmern, lived at the castle.Ernst Krebs, Zur Geschichte von Heidesheim, in: M√§nner-Gesang-Verein \\"Einigkeit\\", Hrsg., Festschrift zur Fahnenweihe verbunden mit Wertungssingen am 4., 5. und 6.

His successor, Heinrich von Stockheim, had his own seat built after 1577 in the form of the Schlossm√ºhle (‚ÄúCastle Mill‚Äù).Siehe unten: 4.1.5.1 Die Schlossm√ºhle: Die Herren von Winterau, von Stockheim und von der Leyen (1317-1793). Whether his successor moved back into the castle is uncertain. Whatever happened, Windeck was still owned by the Court Chamber (Hofkammer), which then granted Samuel Becker, the cellarmaster (winemaker) at the Martinsburg (a now vanished castle) at Mainz the castle, the estate and the eighth of the Heidesheim tithes that came along with those in 1629, as a heritable holding.Hessisches Hauptstaatsarchiv Wiesbaden Abt. 101 Nr. 627/1 (Abschrift). In the description of the Parish of Heidesheim drawn up sometime between 1667 and 1677 in Johann Sebastian Severus's Dioecesis Moguntina, it says: > ‚ÄúOn the edge of the village towards the Rhine one beholds farther away the > castle house at the Wintereck which in the year 1626 Samuel Beck, chief > cellarmaster at Mainz, acquired for himself and his family along with the > forest, meadows, fields and cereal tributes for 800 Gulden and today has > outfitted with an appealing building and fruit trees.Ubi et in fine oppidi > versus Rhenum castrum - sive das Burghauss zum Wintereck - visitur, quod > anno 1626 Samuel Beck cellarius primarius - Oberkeller zu Maintz - una cum > sylva, pratis, agris pro 800 florenis cum censibus frumentitiis sibi et suis > coemit et eleganti aedificio lignisque pomiferis exornavit hodie.

Towards the end of the Thirty Years' War, the notorious cavalry general Johann von Werth is said to have lived at the castle.Bronnen (wie Anm. ??) S. 35. After 1650, it ended up with the Barons of Bockenheim,Emperor Matthew raised Lautwein Bockenheimer and his descendants to nobility on 30 September 1613 in Regensburg. A copy of the letters patent is kept at the Willi Geisenhof private archive in Heidesheim. who thereafter held it for roughly 150 years on a heritable lease. The family had entitlement to pewage and burial in the parish church. When the French occupied Electoral Mainz on 21 October 1793, Windeck Castle, as an ecclesiastical and noble holding, was seized.Dazu und zum Folgenden: Ernst Krebs, Zur Geschichte von Heidesheim, in: M√§nner-Gesang- Verein \\"Einigkeit\\" Heidesheim, Hrsg., Festschrift zur Fahnenweihe verbunden mit Wertungssingen am 4., 5. und 6.

The von Bockenheim family emigrated to Austria. Only Katharina Elisabeth von Bockenheim stayed in Heidesheim, where in 1844 she died at the great age of 95. The Windeck was auctioned off sometime in 1802 or 1803 as state property. The new owner was a Wackernheim townsman named Radicke. His widow handed the property on to the Mainz businessmen Reinach and Popp, who in the second fourth of the 19th century kept a tannery there. In the 1860s, the family Krebs acquired the Windeck. Otto Krebs ran a winery in it with an inn. After 1908, beginning with Christmas, the Evangelical parish held its church services in the hall on the ground floor. In 1984, the castle was, as once before, a private home. At the time of the Lords of Winterau, the castle's outer girding wall enclosed an extensive area, as still witnessed today by the cadastral names Hinter den Ziunen or Hinter den Z√§unen (‚ÄúBehind the Fences‚Äù) and In der Zingel or In der Ringmauer (‚ÄúIn the Girding Wall‚Äù). After the Thirty Years' War, the citizens of Heidesheim began to use this wall as a quarry, tearing it down in the process. Andreas Trauttner's 1754 map shows the Windeck already in the shape seen today.Stadtarchiv Mainz Sign. 4467 D. The originally open area between the tower and the inner wall is covered by a gabled roof and thus used as a stately home stretching across the north, east and southeast around the tower. In the southwest and west, the wall has been levelled, through which the tower on the building's western edge rises. It is likely that Samuel Beck gave it this shape after 1626. The ogival-arch portal and the large-scale crossbar windows (windows divided by cross-shaped spars into groups of four windows) in Gothic Revival style stem from the time after 1860, as does the room layout inside.Dieter Krienke, Bearb., Kreis Mainz- Bingen: St√§dte Bingen und Ingelheim, Gemeinde Budenheim, Verbandsgemeinden Gau-Algesheim, Heidesheim, Rhein-Nahe und Sprendlingen-Gensingen, Worms 2007 (= Denkmaltopographie Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Kulturdenkm√§ler in Rheinland-Pfalz, Bd. 18.1), S. 314. The outbuildings shown in the cadastral plans from 1812 and from 1841 to 1843 have disappeared. When the municipality of Heidesheim acquired Windeck Castle in 1993, it was in a state of ruin. Since then, the municipality has undertaken great pains to bring the building into a respectable state: First, the elaborate roof framework and the roof, and then the entrance doors and windows were renovated. The building was newly plastered, given a coat of Mainz red from the Late Middle Ages, and the tower was decorated in natural colours. Finally, a staircase was built into the tower, which leads up to the former roof level with its impressive view. In its efforts to raise the Windeck from its ruins, the municipality is tirelessly and enthusiastically supported by the club Heimatmuseum Burg Windeck e.V.. Volunteer helpers take care of this still considerable property. = The Castle Mill =  The Lords of Winterau, of Stockheim and of the Leyen (1317-1793)  The Castle Mill (Schlossm√ºhle) lies at Heidesheim's southwest edge at the foot of the cadastral area of Sommerau. There Sir Werner of Winterau owned land that he bequeathed to his sons in his will of 16 August 1317.Karl Rossel, Hrsg., Urkundenbuch der Abtei Eberbach, Bd. 2, Wiesbaden 1870, S. 665 Nr. 793. Ernst Krebs has presumed that on the Castle Mill's lands was a farm whose land was already being worked by Sir Werner's forebear Herdegen II. That he moved from there to the castle in 1209 does not make senseErnst Krebs, Zur Geschichte von Heidesheim, in: M√§nner-Gesang-Verein Einigkeit Heidesheim, Hrsg., Festschrift zur Fahnenweihe verbunden mit Wertungssingen am 4., 5. und 6. Juli 1925, Gau-Algesheim o.J. (1925) S. 5-33 bes. S. 25. ‚Äì on 27 October 1577, Hans Georg von Bicken (d. 1608) sold Heinrich von Stockheim (d. 1588) the Castle Mill area.Hessisches Staatsarchiv Darmstadt, Bestand A 2 Nr. 84/42. Hans Georg von Bicken, from the family Bicken, was the Electoral Mainz vicegerent (Vitztum) in the Rheingau and Vogt of the Mainz Convent of Altm√ºnster in Heidesheim; Heinrich von Stockheim was cathedral cantor at Mainz, povost of Saint Alban's Abbey there and Electoral Amtmann in Heidesheim. In the years that followed, Heinrich von Stockheim had the still-preserved Renaissance building and the adjoining chapel tower built on the site of a simple mill building. They served him as an official seat and a dwelling. At the same time the main building housed a mill that with surrounding barns and stables formed an economic hub of extensive lands and of rich revenues, which Heinrich von Stockheim acquired in Heidesheim beginning in 1565. In the description of the Parish of Heidesheim drawn up sometime between 1667 and 1677 in Johann Sebastian Severus's Dioecesis Moguntina, it says of the Castle Mill: > ‚ÄúIncidentally, an important mill is vaunted ‚Äì with a great house, barns and > stalls, garden and other appurtenances. It was built in 1577 by a member of > the family Stockheim, who was cathedral cantor in Mainz and village > Amtmann.‚ÄùJohann Sebastian Severus, Dioecesis Moguntina, im Stadtarchiv > Mainz, Signatur H.B.A. I 50, vol.

Thereafter the property found itself owned by the Lords ‚Äì beginning in 1711 Counts ‚Äì of the Leyen, who administered their scattered holdings on the Moselle and the Rhine first from Koblenz and beginning in 1773 from Blieskastel (Saarpfalz) and gave out the Castle Mill on a heritable lease. Information about the time from 1677 to 1793 is promised by the contents of the archives of the (beginning in 1806) Princes of the Leyen, which in 1995 ended up in the Rhineland-Palatinate Main State Archive in Koblenz, but hitherto not much of this information has been forthcoming.Anja Ostrowitzki, Bearb., Inventar der Akten und Amtsb√ºcher des Archivs der F√ºrsten von der Leyen im Landeshauptarchiv Koblenz, Koblenz 2004 (= Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Landesarchivverwaltung Rheinland-Pfalz, Bd. 102).  The dark 19th century, Krebs, Sch√∂n, Schmidt (1793-1920)  From the end of the 18th on into the latter half of the 19th century, the Castle Mill's ownership history raises more questions than it answers: on 21 October 1793, French Revolutionary troops occupied Electoral Mainz; on 4 November 1797, France annexed the Rhine's left bank; on 9 February 1801 the German Empire ceded the area to France in the Treaty of Lun√©ville. Noble and ecclesiastical holdings were seized for the French State and publicly auctioned. Whether or not the Castle Mill met with this fate, it was restored on 25 June 1804 by Napoleon to Count Philipp Franz von der Leyen (d. 1829), and he later sold it ‚Äì no later than 1820 ‚Äì when the prince was getting rid of his last holdings on the Middle Rhine, only to acquire Schloss Waal (a castle in Ostallg√§u) a few years later. The archives of the Princes of the Leyen are yielding as little about the upheavals of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars as about the time before this, and as for the decades that followed, no information is forthcoming about the Castle Mill. Although the cadastral plans from 1812 and 1841 to 1843 offer a scale drawing of the property, they say nothing about the castle's owners. The municipality's cadastral register lays down in writing on 26 July 1865 that the estate owners were August Krebs (d. 1905?) and his wife Elisabeth, n√©e Schmahl, who had acquired the Castle Mill by way of trade ‚Äì from whom it is unknown. Karl Sturm reports that Klara Fauerbach owned a notarielle Beurkundung (‚Äúnotarized certification‚Äù) about 1970 according to which her grandfather August Krebs ‚Äúbought the Castle Mill property on 4 February 1870 for 22,000 Gulden from Franz Hembes, mayor and estate owner in Ober-Olm, who had earlier acquired it from the miller Michael Hembes for 20,000 Gulden. According to information from Mrs. Fauerbach, her grandparents were then in possession of the property until 1905‚Ä¶‚Äù.Karl Sturm, Was wissen wir von der Schlo√üm√ºhle?, in: Nachrichtenblatt der Gemeinde Heidesheim am Rhein 21. Jahrgang Nr. 47 vom 20. November 1970, S. ?. Since the buying and selling dates and the circumstances of the transaction are at odds with the official data in the cadastral register, the whole business must be approached with caution. August Krebs ran on the lands, besides agricultural operations, three mills: one sawmill, which was most likely housed in the southwest in the area bordering the Praumenm√ºhle (not one of his mills), a gristmill, which without doubt was housed in the main building, and an oil mill, which might have been found in the little quarrystone building in the north leaning against the property's west perimeter wall and dating from before 1841. As the J. Schmitt steam mill in Mainz-Mombach expanded in the early years of the 20th century, the traditional watermills in the area became ever less profitable, and August Krebs's mills shut down as surely as the rest. It is likely that they stopped running with his death. On 17 June 1918 August Krebs's heirs sold the Castle Mill for 48,000 paper marks or 38,400 gold marks to the Wiesbaden engineer Michael Sch√∂n and his wife Maria Susanna, n√©e Zahn. They sold it again only a year later, on 25 June 1919 for 62,500 paper marks or 19,437 gold marks ‚Äì and 50 Pfennigs ‚Äì to the Wiesbaden master painter Karl Schmidt and his wife Luise, n√©e Kr√ºger, who provided the rather shabby building with a coat of paint, but less than a year later they sold it again, on 7 May 1920 for 180,000 paper marks or 15,822 gold marks, to the Wiesbaden court apothecary Max Holl√§nder. The prices that Michael Sch√∂n and Karl Schmidt paid for the Castle Mill and for which they sold it bespeak their use of the property at the end of the First World War in the run on tangible assets or for speculation. Neither took any measures to move his household to Heidesheim, and instead let the building. Not so Max Holl√§nder; for health reasons he was obliged to flee the Wiesbaden climate and move with his wife into the Castle Mill. Wealth was obviously something that he did not lack.  Max and Sofie Holl√§nder (1920-1929) Max and Johanna Hollander (1930-1938) In the years after 1920 to 1929 Max and Sofie Holl√§nder shaped the ruined Castle Mill into a true jewel. In 1929 Max and Sofie Hollander divorced and in 1930 Max Hollander married Johanna Hollander. In 1934, Nikolaus Haupt reported in the municipality's newssheet about the renovation: > ‚ÄúIt was carried out from the mighty cellar vaults with the foundation, which > here and there is more than two metres thick, up to the loft and it was > worked in a radical way. From the three-floor loft, the lower floor was also > expanded into dwelling rooms. The important works were performed almost > wholly by Heidesheim tradesmen. In the main it is a matter of artistic wall > and ceiling coverings, which are made to match the building‚Äôs character and > which have already enjoyed much attention and approval from professionals. > The works are an honorific attestation for former applied arts student and > now master joiner Peter Schlitz‚Äôs mastery and achievement here. > ‚ÄúIn the left wing beside the main building‚Äôs entrance is found the former > Castle Chapel, a rectangular room with two dainty cross vaults resting in > the middle on a column. Even this the owner has in mind to have converted to > its former purpose. The property thus represents as a whole through the > renovation and careful handling an important jewel within the municipality > of Heidesheim.‚Äù In 1938, when Max Holl√§nder had to accept that as a Jew he could no longer remain in Germany, he announced: > ‚ÄúCastle property on the Rhine for sale immediately, Near Mainz! Renaissance > building under conservation! Enthusiast‚Äôs item! Rarity value! The property, > some 5 minutes away from the railway station ‚Äì Basel-Holland, Frankfurt- > Paris lines ‚Äì forms a complete whole in one plan, utterly enclosed, and > comprises over 11 000 m¬≤ estate area, built-up area, orchard and vegetable > garden (choice fruit, almond trees, choice chestnuts), 2 work buildings > supplied by heat from the house.

And at Christmastime, Mrs. Hollander went with a basket on her arm down the Grabenstra√üe, to give gifts out to the children. Older fellow citizens remember today: ‚Äúa good-hearted woman!‚Äù The impositions against the couple as Jews that had been happening since 1933 grew even worse: After the Second World War, Johanna Holl√§nder reported that already in May 1933, the Bingen Gestapo were extorting money from her husband and her. One month later the mayor of Heidesheim arrested Max Holl√§nder, whom his driver had denounced, and transferred him to Osthofen concentration camp. After a few weeks, he was moved to the prison there, where his wife was also being held. After almost ten weeks, both were allowed to betake themselves, under police supervision, to a sanatorium in Bad Nauheim. In late September 1933, the Mainz regional court acquitted the couple. Beginning on 1 April 1934, Max and Johanna Holl√§nder lived once again at the Castle Mill. The municipal administration's chicanery, though, steadily grew. In 1938 the couple wanted to sell the property pu blicly (see above) ‚Äì too late. On 10 November 1938 ‚Äì the day after Kristallnacht ‚Äì Max and Johanna Holl√§nder were sitting on packed cases when the Gestapo and municipal officials violently forced their way into the Castle Mill, arrested Max Holl√§nder and took him to the Town Hall. There, the mayor, a councillor and a notary forced him under duress to donate his whole estate to the municipality. At the same time the couple had to give notice in Heidesheim of their departure and go to Wiesbaden on the next train. There, Max Holl√§nder was arrested at the railway station and taken to Buchenwald concentration camp. Released after 14 days, the couple managed to emigrate in late May 1939. Their way led through the Philippines to New York, where on 10 December 1941, Max Holl√§nder died.  Municipality of Heidesheim (1938-1956)  As early as 11 November 1938, the day after Max and Johanna Holl√§nder's arrest, there appeared an article in the Gau-Algesheim, Heidesheim and Wackernheim community newssheet under the headline ‚ÄúAn Old Historical Building in Ownership of Municipality of Heidesheim‚Äù; it could hardly have been full of more hypocrisy and spite: > ‚ÄúThe Castle Mill ‚Äì the oldest building of the Municipality of Heidesheim ‚Äì > passed on 10 November as a donation into the ownership of the Municipality > of Heidesheim. Yesterday, 12:45, the owner up to now, Max Holl√§nder, made > the building over to the municipality‚Äôs ownership through a provisional > agreement ‚Äì of his own free will and influenced by no party. And thus has > the long-fostered wish for the property one day to pass to the municipality > become reality. Holl√§nder for a long time had the thought of putting the > building at the disposal of the Municipality of Heidesheim.‚Äù On the Sunday after Max and Johanna Holl√§nder had been driven out ‚Äì 20 November 1938 ‚Äì the municipality opened the Castle Mill with admission at ten Pfennigs so that the citizens could themselves get an idea of the opulence in which the Jews ‚Äúsplurged‚Äù, while ethnic Germans were starving. More than 1,000 people gathered. So big was the throng that the spectacle was repeated the next Sunday ‚Äúby popular demand‚Äù. Thereafter it became oddly quiet about the Castle Mill. Obviously the municipality knew that it had started nothing right with its long yearned-for property, the more so as the Bingen district office brought the donation into doubt, since it was against Nazi principles ‚Äì if such things could be said to exist ‚Äì to accept gifts from Jews. Only in 1940 were the ownership relationships clarified, when the Municipality of Heidesheim paid 3,930 Reichsmark into ‚Äúemigrant‚Äù Max Holl√§nder's frozen account, thus changing the apparent donation into a sale. The municipality, though, had long before let out the Castle Mill to the military authorities in Mainz for dwelling purposes. There followed bombed-out families and refugees from Mainz ‚Äì all in all up to eight parties. After the end of the Second World War, Johanna Holl√§nder filed suit ‚Äì obviously from New York ‚Äì on 20 May 1949 for compensation. In the case of the Castle Mill she sought to get it back and to be paid damages in the amount of DM100,000. Once she had come back to Wiesbaden, the embittered woman pursued the case doggedly and forcefully. When on 22 July 1954 the Fifth Civil Chamber of the Mainz Regional Court awarded her the Castle Mill and damages amounting to DM49,400 together with 4% interest since 20 May 1949, she launched an appeal. The case was long and drawn out and ended in a settlement, which after a series of expert opinions and various crime scene visits was drawn up on 19 November 1956 after being suggested by the Chief Magistrate presiding at the Third Civil Senate of the Koblenz Chief State Court. Johanna Holl√§nder got the Castle Mill back together with the originally sought damages of DM100,000 and 4% interest since 20 May 1949. Together with the cost of the legal battle, the Municipality of Heidesheim had roughly DM150,000 to bear in costs.  Johanna Holl√§nder and C. H. Boehringer Sohn (1956-present)  On 26 April 1957, Mayor Joseph Dillmann made a declaration of bankruptcy in the municipality's newssheet: > ‚ÄúAfter the speech by the municipality‚Äôs legal representative before > municipal council, it has after due consideration and with a heavy heart > accepted the settlement. Given the municipality‚Äôs weak legal position, > however, the legal dispute, which went on for 7 years, can no longer be > further pursued. The damage sum is only a substitute for the damages that > the municipality must answer for; the Castle Mill remains the plaintiff‚Äôs > property. The damage award comprises the compensation of the damage in > buildings, gardening facilities and lost use. > ‚ÄúThrough this financial burden the municipality‚Äôs budgetary economy is being > put before some burdensome challenges. Nevertheless, the challenges > necessary for the municipality‚Äôs further development must be continued. The > damage sum can only be covered through the assumption of a short-term > municipal credit. Amortization and interest payment must be dealt with out > of the regular budget. An increase in property and business tax to 200 or > 300 percent of the average state rates therefore cannot be avoided.‚Äù And then came the late confession: > ‚ÄúPerhaps those who are also responsible will recognize the injustice in > which they ‚Äì perhaps unwittingly ‚Äì have been complicit, and that they have > brought the municipality untold harm. It is needless to want to gloss over > anything. It was a crime and the whole municipality must bear the > consequences. Unfortunately, the main culprit cannot be held liable for > compensation, since he owns nothing.‚Äù The rest of the story can be told quickly: Whether Johanna Holl√§nder ever saw the Castle Mill again is questionable. She had whatever still seemed usable fetched from the property. It was rather little, for the wood panelling had been used in the years of need after the war as firewood, and the velvet coverings on the walls had been made into children's clothing. Besides that she settled for the income from the ongoing rental that the utterly ruined property was still bringing in. Johanna Holl√§nder died sometime before 29 January 1969. On this day the Castle Mill was entered in the Heidesheim register as belonging to her heirs: half went to each of the State League of Jewish Communities in Hesse (Landesverband der J√ºdischen Gemeinde in Hessen) and Irgim Ol√®g Merkaz Europa in Tel Aviv. They could do little with the property and were glad when on 11 March 1970 it was sold off to Heidesheim building entrepreneur Theodor Kiese. Only a fortnight later, he passed it on to the Ingelheim pharmaceutical firm C. H. Boehringer Sohn. C. H. Boehringer Sohn had the thoroughly run-down property renovated from the ground up as a representative residence for a member of the company's board. When work had already proceeded to a great extent, the main and side buildings burnt down to the foundations and outer walls on 1 September 1971. The question of guilt was never settled. Under the monument authority's strict conditions, C. H. Boehringer Sohn built the Castle Mill anew. From 1976 to 2000, the main building was used for presentations and seminars. Since 2000 it has housed the office of the business association's and shareholders‚Äô foundations: Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds, foundation for basic medical research; Boehringer Ingelheim Stiftung; and Geschwister Boehringer Ingelheim, foundation for the humanities. = Jewish graveyard = See: Dieter Krienke, ed., Kreis Mainz-Bingen.

Regular events  On the first Sunday in May, the kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the Kerb) is held. The first Sunday in October is the time for the Harvest Festival (Erntedankfest) with a major parade, an exhibition of fruits and agricultural products and visits from partner towns in France and Germany.  Clubs  Like many German villages and small towns, Heidesheim is home to many associations, clubs and groups, in German known as \\"Vereine\\". They are a major part of civic life and cover many aspects of people's leisure time: 1\\\\. Sports association with many divisions, e.g. soccer, hockey, athletics, tennis 2\\\\. Choirs: men's, ladies‚Äô and children's choirs, church choirs and mixed choirs 3\\\\. Marching bands offer regular concerts, perform at local and regional festivities and provide extensive training for young people aspiring to master musical instruments. 4\\\\. Church youth and adult groups cover all ages and both sexes. Examples are KJG and KFD 5\\\\. Special interest clubs exist for dog owners, poultry, chess, the preservation of historical monuments (especially Saint George's Chapel), photography, and so on.  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  Heidesheim lies on the Autobahn A 60, which can be reached through interchanges 16 (west) and 17 (east). Through the two railway stations Uhlerborn and Heidesheim (Rheinhessen), there are two connections to local rail transport on the West Rhine Railway (KBS 470). The two nearest long-distance railway stations are Bingen and Mainz Hauptbahnhof. Heidesheim is also linked to the Ingelheim/Mainz bus system (route 620), which runs to Ingelheim in the west and to Budenheim, Mainz Mombach and Mainz Hauptbahnhof in the east, therefore fundamentally following the same route as the train. Thus far there is still no direct bus link to the neighbouring Mainz constituent communities of Gonsenheim and Finthen. There are initiatives, though.  Established businesses  In the Uhlerborn commercial area are found a gardening centre (Dehner), two supermarkets (Aldi, Edeka) and two bakeries. Moreover, there are a printshop, a carpentry shop, a building firm and a few smaller businesses.

As of 2018, it was the fifth largest law firm in the U.S. and the 13th highest grossing law firm in the world. Jones Day is one of the most elite law firms in the world, ranking first in both M&A; league tables and the 2017 U.S. Law Firm Brand Index 2017. Jones Day has numerous high profile clients, including U.S. President Donald Trump, Fox News, and represents over half of the companies in the Fortune 500, including Goldman Sachs, General Motors, and Verizon.https://www.upslide.net/en/50-best-law-firms-in-the-world/#jones-day  History  Jones Day was founded as Blandin & Rice in 1893 by two partners, Edwin J. Blandin and William Lowe Rice, in Cleveland, Ohio.; Frank Ginn joined the firm in 1899, and it changed its name to Blandin, Rice & Ginn. Rice was murdered in August 1910. In 1912, Thomas H. Hogsett joined the firm as partner, and it became Blandin, Hogsett & Ginn that year, and Tolles, Hogsett, Ginn & Morley a year later after the retirement of Judge Blandin and the addition of partners Sheldon H. Tolles and John C. Morley. After Morley retired, in 1928, the firm adopted the name Tolles, Hogsett & Ginn. In its early years, the firm was known for representing major industries in the Cleveland area, including Standard Oil and several railroad and utility companies. In November 1938, then-managing partner Thomas Jones led the merger of Tolles, Hogsett & Ginn with litigation-focused firm Day, Young, Veach & LeFever to create Jones, Day, Cockley & Reavis. The merger was effective January 1, 1939. The firm's Washington, D.C., office was opened in 1946, becoming the firm's first office outside Ohio. In 1967, the firm merged with D.C. firm Pogue & Neal to become Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. International expansion The international expansion of Jones Day began in 1986 when the firm merged with boutique law firm Surrey & Morse, a firm of 75 attorneys with international offices in New York City, Paris, London, and Washington, D.C. The following years the firm expanded to Hong Kong, Brussels, Tokyo, Taipei, and Frankfurt.  Operations  Jones Day offices in Washington, D.C. As of 2018, Jones Day was the fifth largest law firm in the U.S. and the 13th highest grossing law firm in the world.  Compensation  The firm compensates each associate (after their first year) uniquely, based on the quality of their work, and jurisdiction. Unlike many peer firms, Jones Day does not pay a year-end or mid-year bonus, compensating associates entirely with salary; salaries are not public and are not determined by class-year, and the firm has long said that its \\"black box\\" compensation system breeds collegiality, and that its associates‚Äîeven though they are not paid a bonus‚Äîgenerally earn the same as, or more than, associates at other major firms. New associates have a starting salary of US$190,000. Some associates have said that they are under-compensated compared to their peers at other firms, sometimes by tens of thousands of dollars, and that their compensation is much lower than what they were promised when they interviewed.  Donald Trump presidential campaign counsel  Jones Day partner Don McGahn, who was previously a member of the Federal Election Commission, served as counsel for the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign and was later nominated to serve as Trump's White House Counsel. As of March 2017, at least 14 Jones Day attorneys had been appointed to work for the Trump administration.  German office raid  In March 2017, the firm's Munich office was raided in order to obtain confidential client documents held by the firm in relation to its Munich-based Volkswagen emissions scandal internal investigation. The public prosecutor's office seized electronic data and \\"a large number of paper files\\" for use in the Brunswick, Germany-based investigation of Volkswagen Group subsidiary Audi AG. German courts upheld the legality of the raid, and no further charges resulted, as of March 2019.  Gender Discrimination Suit  In 2019, six plaintiffs, who were former Jones Day Associates, filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the firm in Washington DC federal court. The plaintiffs allege unfair pay between female and male associates at the firm. Jones Day has denied the allegations made by the plaintiffs and the case is currently pending further litigation.

Programming may be exclusively by students, or may include programmers from the wider community in which the radio station is based. Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel, sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming, while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters. Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments, and have very different characteristics from one country to the next. One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness‚Äîor, in some countries, even a licensing requirement‚Äîto broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits. Because of this, campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends, including genres such as punk and new wave, alternative rock, indie rock and hip hop, long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream. Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists. Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news (often local), sports (often relating to the campus), and spoken word programming as well as general music. Often the radio format is best described as a freeform, with much creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts. Some of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet. Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air, many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting, closed circuit or carrier current systems, often to on-campus listeners only. Some radio stations are distributed through the cable television system on cable FM or the second audio program of a TV radio station. Some universities and colleges broadcast one or more Internet radio feeds‚Äîeither instead of, or in addition to a campus radio station‚Äîwhich may differ in radio formats significantly from licensed traditional campus radio.

Canada In Canada, radio stations are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which provides that \\"a campus radio station is a radio station owned or controlled by a not-for-profit organization associated with a post-secondary educational institution\\". The CRTC distinguishes two types of campus radio: instructional (for training of professional broadcasters) and community-based campus (programming provided by volunteers who are not training to be professionals). The community-based radio format is the predominant one, colloquially known as \\"campus-community radio.\\" In recent years, some community-based campus radio stations, including CFFF-FM in Peterborough and CJMQ-FM in Sherbrooke, have in fact had their CRTC licenses formally reclassified from campus radio to community radio. Campus radio stations broadcasting at full power are assigned a permanent frequency and call letters and, aside from a requirement not to compete directly with commercial radio stations, are full players in the Canadian broadcasting spectrum. Campus radio stations in Canada are more commonly associated with universities than with colleges, although some colleges also have licensed campus radio stations. As well, some institutions maintain unlicensed campus radio operations which broadcast only by closed circuit, cable FM or Internet streaming. Also see United States section for more general information. Canada's oldest community-based campus radio station is CFRC at Queen's University in Kingston, which has been on the air since 1923; it began as a commercial radio station and a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation affiliate, but became the country's first university-owned station in 1942 and fully transitioned to a campus radio station in 1957. CJRT-FM, a campus radio station of the instructional type, has been on air since 1949. The CRTC places responsibilities upon campus radio stations in Canada through the use of conditions of license that radio stations must follow in order to keep broadcasting. Campus radio stations, for example, are expected to be leaders in the Canadian content system which mandates a minimum number of Canadian musical selections throughout the day. The minimum Canadian content required for a campus station is 35%. Individual programs have their own requirements which depend on a particular program's content category. Generally, for popular music programs (pop, rock, dance, country-oriented, acoustic, and easy listening), hosts must play a minimum of 35% Canadian content. Programs featuring Special Interest Music (concert, folk-oriented, world, blues, jazz, non-classic religious and experimental) must have at least 12% Canadian content. In early 2005, Humber College's radio station CKHC-FM became the first broadcast radio station in Canada to air 100% Canadian content. Other requirements generally made of campus radio stations include quotas of non- hit, folk and ethnic musical selections as well as spoken word programming. Most campus radio stations in Canada are members of the National Campus and Community Radio Association. On January 23, 2012, the CRTC announced it would be eliminating instructional radio stations.Future staticky for KICK-FM. Winnipeg Free Press. Retrieved January 24, 2012. Denmark There are five student radio stations in Denmark related to the largest universities in Denmark. Only the town of Roskilde has a university and no permanent radio, but every year the five existing student radio stations work together in producing 10 days of radio on the Roskilde festival. The project is a cooperation between all the student radios organized by the cooperation organization called DDS and could be considered a temporary radio station. The five student radio stations in Denmark are listed below with the city they relate to in Denmark. * Universitetsradioen in Copenhagen * XFM Lyngby in Lyngby * Odense studenterradio in Odense * Arhus studenterradio in √Örhus * Aalborg studenterradio in Aalborg All the radios broadcast radio in local frequencies on FM in their related city. XFM actually has two departments one in Copenhagen and one in Lyngby and is the only radio who has two broadcast licenses. The only one of the radio stations which broadcasts radio directly on campus is Aalborg studentradio. As many of the American studentradio Aalborg has speaker directly on the university where they can broadcast radio to the students cad Campus Rdio AAU. France Radio Campus France is a national, non-profit radio broadcasting network grouping 22 public college radio stations located in the largest French cities. Acting as an umbrellas for college radio in French public Universities, it proves that there is strength in numbers, and that music, technology and education are natural bedfellows. Not just a collection of disparate elements, Radio Campus is a vocal leader in the areas of digital broadcasting, keeping tabs on the development of terrestrial radio, as well as developing new network interfaces for radio stations across the nation to share content. With a broad music program, the playlist is powered by the passion of fans, and heralds a modern way for groups to interact in the social web.

News, as of November 2006, has it that the India cabinet decided to grant permission to non-profit organizations and educational institutions to set up community radio stations. The cabinet decision will allow civil society and voluntary organizations, state agriculture universities and institutions, Krishi Vigyan Kendras or agricultural science centres, registered societies and autonomous boards and public trusts registered under Societies Act to start community radio stations. Broadcast Engineering Consultants of India is a government owned corporation that helps setup of Community FM radio stations in India. Ravi Shankar Prasad, the then Minister for Information and Broadcasting in the government, told India's upper house of parliament the Rajya Sabha on December 22, 2003, that four organizations including Jammu University and Kashmir University were found ineligible for grant of license as per the laid down guidelines. The minister also ruled out any review of the policy despite limited response to the non-commercial, low-powered FM radio scheme which former information and broadcasting minister Sushma Swaraj had said would \\"revolutionize\\" radio broadcast in the country. Radio enthusiast Alokesh Gupta saying: \\"The announcement of the Government was to have seen 1000 radio stations by December 2003. Instead administrative wrangling came in the way of implementing the project as colleges spent time running around for licenses and approval from four ministries ‚Äî Home Affairs, Communications & Information & Broadcasting ‚Äî as they took their time processing applications.\\" On February 2, 2004, Anna University in Chennai unveiled the country's first campus radio station, Anna FM. Radio Ujjas in Kutch (in the western state of Gujarat) is one such CR and gets its funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Central Government. Similarly a community based radio programme titled Panchayat Vani (People's Voice) was recently broadcast on All India Radio (AIR), Darbhanga, Bihar. The campus radio station Gyanvaani has also been licensed. Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences established a community radio station, Radio Adan (90.4 Mhz) in 2008, which brings together experts, students, farmers and local population, through various popular programmes, focussing on agriculture, education, employment, women empowerment, child marriage, health and culture.https://mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/Community%20Radio%20Compendium%202019.pdf Pune University is the first university in the state of Maharashtra to have an FM radio station. The University of Pune's FM Radio inaugurated on May 1, 2005, has been named as Vidyavani. It covers a wide range of subjects, focusing specifically on the requirements of students of various departments and affiliated colleges. It reaches an area around the campus within eight-km radius. Unsuccessful attempts have been also made to start CR without obtaining any permission. The small village of Orvakal in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh (South India) launched \\"Mana Radio\\" (Our Radio) in November 2002. This project run under the aegis of the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty used a tiny transmitter that covered a radius of half a kilometer to enable rural women members of self-help groups. Four months later, officials from the Central Government brought in police to seize the equipment and declared the broadcasts illegal. The Government policy to permit educational institutions to have their own FM Channels at low frequency levels emerged in mid December 2002, as a result of years of campaigning by activists and a strongly worded Supreme Court judgment directing the opening up of the airwaves. A unique experiment in using media technologies, especially radio, for development and empowerment of marginalized, rural communities is the community radio initiative \\"Chalo Ho Gaon Mein\\" a programme that is broadcast once a week on AIR Daltonganj in the Palamu district of Jharkhand, eastern India. This radio programme is supported by the National Foundation for India and produced by Community representatives, of Alternative for India Development (AID), a non-governmental organization. School of Communication of Manipal also has its own campus radio. According to the terms of the campus broad license, a number of aspects are disallowed from broadcasts. This includes anything that offends good taste or decency, contains criticism of friendly countries, contains an attack on religion, contains anything obscene, defamatory, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths, likely to encourage or incite violence, contains anything affecting the integrity of the nation, criticizes, maligns or slanders any individual in person, encourages superstition or blind belief, denigrates women, denigrates children, or presents or depicts or suggests as desirable the misuse of drugs, alcohol, narcotics, and tobacco.

The shows range from music, informal chat, news and current affairs, with many people of the locality praising the station for its involvement in local affairs. The station is primarily run by students in the Creative Digital Media (CDM) course but is open to students of all disciplines. The station is largely self funding from sponsorships and usually have prizes to give away during broadcasts. The station is however forbidden from promoting alcohol or drug use. The station uses the tag line \\"Your Big, Little Station\\" associated with the size of the college and the scope of the work students undertake. The frequency of the station has changed many times over the years and is unknown for 2015. Israel Campus radio also exists in Israel, where several colleges, universities and high schools have successful programs. One of the most famous is Kol HaCampus (Voice of the Campus/Campus Voice), broadcast out of Tel Aviv on 106 MHz. More information can be found with the Israeli Broadcasting Authority. Another college radio station is the Hebrew University's in Jerusalem, broadcasting mostly indie and alternative music. In 2011 the Technion has joined these universities with a new campus radio station, Radio 1m. In 2017 the students of Sede Boquer Campus of the Ben Gurion University established SB Campus Radio, which function as a podcast network.

Founded in 1960, the University of Hertfordshire's Campus Radio Hatfield (now Crush Radio) was the UK's first student radio station, though it was a pirate radio station. This was followed by the first legal station, Radio Heslington (now University Radio York) in 1967, Swansea University's Action Radio (now Xtreme Radio) in 1968, Stirling University's University Radio Airthrey (now Air3 Radio) from 1970, University of Essex's University Radio Essex in 1971, and Loughborough University's Loughborough Campus Radio in 1973. Some student radio stations operate on the FM waveband for short periods at a time under the Restricted Service Licence scheme, while others choose to broadcast full-time on the AM waveband using an LPAM licence. There are only five UK student radio stations permitted to broadcast all year on LPFM. These are Xpression FM (Exeter), Radio Roseland (Truro, Cornwall), Storm FM (Bangor), Bailrigg FM (Lancaster) and 1386 HCR (Halesowen College). None of these licences provides for a reception area greater than four kilometres from the point of transmission. To counteract these licence restrictions and, in the case of AM broadcasts, poor quality audio, many radio stations simulcast on the Internet. The UK Student Radio Association works on behalf of more than fifty UK-based member radio stations to further their development, encourage and facilitate communication between member radio stations and links to the commercial radio industry, and lobby for the membership's interests on both a regional and national level. The association organises and hosts the annual Student Radio Awards in conjunction with BBC Radio 1. See also List of radio stations in the United Kingdom United States College radio (as it is generally known in the United States) became commonplace in the 1960s when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began issuing class D licenses for ten-watt radio stations to further the development of the then new FM band. Some colleges had already been broadcasting for decades on the AM band, often originating in physics experiments in the early 20th century. One of the first college radio stations in the country is WRUC from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Its first experimental audio broadcasts under the call sign 2YU were in 1916.\\"Union College\\", Education's Own Stations by S. E. Frost, Jr., Ph.D., 1937, pages 437‚Äì441. Regular programing for the public under call sign 2ADD began in 1920. Letter from UCRC to QST Magazine WHUS, (the UConn HUSkies), the radio station of the University of Connecticut went on the air as WABL, a 100-watt AM radio station, in 1922 with two 103-foot (31 m) steel towers serving as the radio station's antennae. In 1925 power increased to 500-watts and the call letters changed to WCAC (Connecticut Agricultural College, at that time the name of the university). Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida started WDBO (Way Down By Orlando) in 1924. WDBO was given away by Rollins College in 1926. College radio returned to Rollins College when the FM radio station, WPRK began broadcasting on December 10, 1952. Most of the FM radio stations received higher-class licenses than ten watts, typically a few hundred watts. A few got several kilowatts, and a small handful got licenses in the range of tens of thousands, sometimes reaching up to maximum-power 100-kilowatt outlets. WRAS 88.5 FM and WREK 91.1 FM in Atlanta are the most powerful college radio station, operating at 100,000 watts. Still, due to strict class D regulations, some radio stations were prohibited from a wattage upgrade for possible signal interference with adjacent radio stations, such as KWUR 90.3 FM interfering with KWMU 90.7 FM in St. Louis, Missouri. KTUH 90.3 FM in Honolulu, Hawaii has had many increases in its wattage since they started broadcasting at 10 watts as a Non-commercial educational FM radio station in 1969. In 1984 KTUH received permission from the board of regents to increase to 100 watts of power. More recently, in 2001, KTUH began transmitting at 3000 watts of power. KTUH is heard on an island wide frequency in Honolulu, Hawaii from 90.1 FM, as well as online at KTUH.ORG and on digital cable channel 866. The earliest college radio stations carried news, intercollegiate sports, and music along with educational shows and sometimes distance learning courses. In the latter portion of the 20th century, many U.S. radio stations played what came to be known as \\"college rock\\" (later known as alternative rock), a type of rock music that had not yet hit the mainstream. Most radio stations have now diversified, with many following a very commercial-like music rotation during the weekdays, and having specialty shows on evenings and weekends. A few radio stations still employ a freeform programming. College radio stations are typically considered to be public radio radio stations in the way that they are funded by donation and grants, but as a radio format the term \\"Public radio\\" generally refers to classical music, jazz, and news. A more accurate term is community radio, as most staff are volunteers, although many radio stations limit staff to current or recent students instead of anyone from the local community. By the late 1970s, FM had taken off, and competition for channels for new radio stations was intensifying. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the newly founded National Public Radio (NPR) convinced the FCC that local low-power radio stations were somehow detrimental to broadcasting, and class D licenses were no longer issued for applications made after 1979, except for broadcast translators to repeat NAB and NPR members' radio stations. Making matters worse for the college stations, they were demoted to secondary status, meaning that they could be forced to downgrade or go silent if a full-power station chose to upgrade or to relocate closer to the college station. Many radio stations were forced to upgrade their facilities at considerable expense. Many other radio stations were eventually forced off the air, because they could not afford the upgrades at all, or not in time to avoid being locked in by other expanding radio stations. There have also been situations where some college radio stations have been forced off the air either temporarily or permanently by the school's administration. Many college radio stations in the U.S. also carry syndicated programming, such as that of National Public Radio and affiliated regional networks. Some radio stations have had student programming taken off the air by the administration in favor of other uses, such as WWGC and KTXT. The original WGST was the subject of an involuntary takeover which saw the state's board of regents sell the radio station as \\"surplus\\" property. A few radio stations have been added to the airwaves as the result of LPFM licensing in the U.S. One example of a Campus Radio station licensed as an LPFM is WIUX-LP of Indiana University, which is able to cover the entire city with its LPFM signal and is competitive in listenership numbers to nearby higher-powered commercial radio stations. Another example of this is WDSW-LP at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. WDSW-LP fully covers its community with a AAA/roots driven format unserved by other local broadcasters. A number of campus radio stations in the US are available using alternate means such as streaming audio over the Internet. Though continuing to broadcast traditionally over the air at 88.5FM, William Penn University's station KWPU in Oskaloosa, IA streams using RadioBOSS. Another such example is DePaul University. Another example is WJHU at Johns Hopkins University. Some radio stations use a variety of methods, such as Loyola University Chicago's WLUW, Lewis University's WLRA (The Start), University of Michigan's WCBN-FM and Embry‚ÄìRiddle Aeronautical University's WIKD-LP who use terrestrial FM, streaming, and mobile media apps. Michigan State University's WDBM (\\"The Impact\\"), University of Minnesota's KUOM (\\"Radio K\\"), and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's WSUM. All three radio stations broadcast traditionally and via online streaming internet radio. WWEC of Elizabethtown College streams online as well. Uruguay In 2006, the University of the Republic from Uruguay got the permits to host its own radio in the frequency 89.1 FM, which is controlled by its own team and students. hihgly informative and authentic See also * High school radio * Indie radio * List of campus radio stations * Low-power broadcasting * Modern rock (Alternative radio) * UK Student Radio Association  References  Category:College radio stations in the United States Category:Radio formats Category:University and college mass media in the United States ","title":"Campus radio"},{"id":"654176","text":"Chang'e is a Chinese moon goddess.

It was coined in 1995 by Ken Keeler, a writer for the television series The Simpsons, and has entered two Oxford quotation dictionaries. Origin The term \\"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\\" first appeared in 'Round Springfield\\", an episode from April 1995 of the American animated television show The Simpsons. In the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the school's Scottish janitor, Groundskeeper Willie, to teach French. Expressing his disdain for the French people, he says to his French class: \\"Bonjour, you cheese-eating surrender monkeys!\\" with his heavy Scottish accent. On the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Al Jean said the line was \\"probably\\" written by The Simpsons staff writer Ken Keeler. In a February 2012 interview, Keeler confirmed that he coined the term; he said he considers it his best contribution to the show. Al Jean commented that the staff did not expect the term to become widely used and never intended it as any kind of genuine political statement. When \\"Round Springfield\\" was dubbed in French, in France, the line became \\"Rendez-vous, singes mangeurs de fromage\\" (\\"Surrender, you cheese-eating monkeys\\"). In Canada, meanwhile, the French dubbed version skips over the line and says \\"Bonjour, aujourd'hui on va √©tudier l'accord du participe futur\\" (\\"Hi, today we'll study the past-future verb tense\\"). Use Use of the term has grown outside of the United States, particularly in the United Kingdom. Politics Opposition Leader Bill Shorten used it in Australian Parliament on 6 March 2014, describing the Government of Australia as \\"the cheese-eating surrender monkeys of Australian jobs\\". When asked to withdraw the comment, Shorten claimed he borrowed the line from an American politician, whom he could not name. On 28 July 2014, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison used it to describe the Labor and Greens position on asylum seekers. Journalism Jonah Goldberg, an American National Review journalist, used it in the title of an April 1999 column on the \\"Top Ten Reasons to Hate the French\\". In the run up to and during the Iraq War, Goldberg reprised it to criticize European nations and France in particular for not joining the Coalition of the Willing, the United States-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. Ben Macintyre of The Times wrote in August 2007 that it is \\"perhaps the most famous\\" of the coinages from The Simpsons and it \\"has gone on to become a journalistic clich√©\\". The New York Post used it (as \\"Surrender Monkeys\\") as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group, and its recommendation that American soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by January 2008. The Daily Telegraph (November 2010) cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. In August 2013, The Independent suggested an evolution away from the term, in a headline about French-American relations over the Syrian Civil War.

He later used it in a 4 June 2006 episode of Top Gear, to describe the manufacturers of the Citro√´n C6.

He was the first player selected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft by the Seattle Mariners. Kansas City Royals Jones was born in Dallas and moved to California as a pre-teen. He played baseball, basketball and football at Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California, earning all-East Bay honors in each sport. He received scholarship offers to play football at Arizona State University, Oregon State University and the University of California, but opted to focus on baseball as he considered himself a better outfielder than wide receiver. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the third round of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. After three seasons in their farm system, in which he batted .287 with 38 home runs and 173 runs batted in, Jones went into Spring training 1976 competing for the open outfield job in right field. Though he had a decent Spring, he was beaten out by Tom Poquette, and reassigned to triple A Omaha just as the regular season was set to begin. After batting .262 with nineteen home runs and 73 RBIs in half a season with the Omaha Royals, Jones earned a call up to the majors for the second half of the 1976 season. He was the hero of his second major league game, going two-for-five and driving in three runs to lead the Royals to an 8‚Äì3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. For the season, he batted .216 with one home run and seven RBIs as a fourth outfielder and left-handed bat off the bench. Seattle Mariners Royals manager Whitey Herzog called Jones one of the top three prospects in his team's organization, and realized that they were likely to lose Jones when he was left unprotected in the 1976 expansion draft. However, given the amount of young talent in the organization, Jones did not fit the team's future plans, and was thereby left unprotected. Actor Danny Kaye, who was part owner of the Seattle Mariners called Jones' name as the first overall pick in the expansion draft. Jones' power and range in center field immediately made him a fan favorite in Seattle. He was batting .256 with seventeen home runs and fifty RBIs at the All-Star break to be named the first ever All-Star representative of the club at the 1977 game. He ended the season at .263 with 24 home runs and 76 RBIs to be named the 1977 Topps Rookie All-Star center fielder. On May 16, 1978, Jones tied a major league record for outfielders with twelve putouts in an extra innings game against the Detroit Tigers. His 1978 season was interrupted by an appendectomy in mid June. He returned in late July, but managed just a .214 batting average the rest of the way. For the season he batted .235 with six home runs and 46 RBIs. He returned healthy in 1979, and established career highs in runs (109), hits (166), triples (9), RBIs (78) and stolen bases (33) while playing a full 162 game schedule. Following the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees with pitcher Jim Lewis for Rick Anderson, Jim Beattie, Juan Ben√≠quez and Jerry Narron. He left the Mariners with the club record for most runs scored in a season (109 in 1979) and he is tied for club records for runs and walks in a game. New York Yankees Jones was batting .223 with nine home runs and 42 RBIs playing center and batting second in the Yankees' line-up when he separated his shoulder on August 25, 1980 crashing into the outfield wall in Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum chasing a Tony Armas fly ball. The Yankees won 103 games that season to win the American League East, however, Jones was unable to appear in the post-season as his injury required season ending surgery. He sued A's owner Charlie Finley after the season. At one point during the Winter Meetings, Jones was rumored to be heading to the Boston Red Sox in a rare Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox deal. However, following the Yankees' signing of Dave Winfield as a free agent, the deal fell through. Instead, he was dealt to the San Diego Padres the following Spring with Joe Lefebvre, Tim Lollar and Chris Welsh for Jerry Mumphrey and John Pacella. San Diego Padres The Padres finished in last place in both halves of the strike shortened 1981 season. For his part, Jones batted .249 and tied for the team lead with 53 runs scored. He was batting .312 with eleven home runs and fifty RBIs at the 1982 All-Star break to earn the second All-Star nod of his career. He was the Padres' sole representative despite the fact that San Diego was in second place in the National League West at the time. In his only at-bat, he led off the third inning with a triple, and scored on a Pete Rose sacrifice fly. Jones was a fan favorite on the 1982 Padres, and Padre Yellow \\"Rupe's Troops\\" T-shirts were a frequent sight during the season. Jones appeared in 133 games for the Padres in 1983, the fewest he'd played in a full season uninterrupted by injury. He was a free agent at the end of the season, and when the Padres acquired Carmelo Mart√≠nez from the Chicago Cubs at the Winter meetings, Jones became expendable. Detroit Tigers Jones spent Spring training 1984 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but failed to make the club. A week into the season, he signed with the Detroit Tigers. He began the season assigned to triple A with the Evansville Triplets; a .313 batting average, nine home runs and 45 RBIs earned him a call up to the majors by the beginning of June. He spent the rest of the season platooning with Larry Herndon in left field and occasionally spelling a day off for Chet Lemon in center. Perhaps his most indelible moment of his season in Detroit came on June 24, when he cleared the right field roof of Tiger Stadium with a shot off Milwaukee Brewers right-hander Tom Tellmann. For the season, Jones batted .284 with 37 RBIs and nine home runs. Six of which came at Tiger Stadium to earn him the nickname \\"Rooftop\\" Ruppert. The 1984 Tigers won 104 games and coasted into the post-season. Jones went hitless in eight at-bats in the American League Championship Series and World Series (in which he faced off against the Padres), winning the Series with the Tigers. He became a free agent at the end of the season. The Tigers believed that he was a part-time player at this stage of his career, and were only willing to pay him as such. After some bitter negotiation between Jones and the Tigers organization, he signed with the California Angels. California Angels Jones served as a fourth outfielder and designated hitter his first season in California. His 21 home runs were second only to Reggie Jackson. He and Jackson switched roles in 1986, with Jackson assuming DH duties and Jones earning most of his playing time in right field. The Angels won the American League West that year, earning Jones his second trip to the post-season, but lost the 1986 American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox in heart-breaking fashion. Jones collected three hits in the ALCS, scoring four runs and driving in two. His role became far more diminished in 1987 as he didn't even log his first plate appearance until the eighth game of the season. He ended up with eight home runs and 28 RBIs in just 213 plate appearances. 1988 season Jones was invited to the Milwaukee Brewers' Spring training camp in Tucson, Arizona as a non-roster invitee in 1988. Though he hit well, he failed to make the club. He signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers in the beginning of May, and earned American Association \\"Player of the Week\\" honors his second week with the Oklahoma City 89ers. His stay in Oklahoma City, however, was brief. After fifty games, he left for Japan, signing with the Hanshin Tigers. He returned to Oklahoma City in 1989, but with a torn rotator cuff and a torn labrum, he called it quits after 27 games. Personal life Jones is divorced from the mother of his daughter and son (Gabrielle and Ranon Jones), and has been married to his second wife, Betty, since 1997. He now lives in Rancho Bernardo, California, a suburb of San Diego, California, and works with The Boon Group, a third-party administrator that sells employee benefits and administrative services to government contractors. He and former major league pitcher Dave Stewart coach the Easton A's, a San Diego-based Travel Ball Team for ages thirteen and fourteen.

One morning some of them drove to the forest to bring home a tree they had bought. But on the way the one who drove first happened to lose his axe, and when the others saw that, they thought he threw it away on purpose, so they threw away their axes as well. Now, as they stood in the forest, they had nothing with which to chop, they didn't know what to do at all, and they certainly didn't want to come home empty-handed. Finally one of them had the brilliant idea to pull the tree down; but as they hadn't brought a rope, one of them had to climb the tree and lay his head in the cleavage between two branches then the others were to pull his legs until the tree yielded. Very well, they pulled and they pulled, and eventually they all fell backwards, including the chap they had been pulling, only he had no head. This they couldn't fathom, they went searching and searching, but no, they didn't find the head, because it was stuck in the tree. Well, that couldn't be helped, now it was time to return home. And so they laid the headless man in the wagon and took him home to his wife and asked if she was sure that her husband had brought his head when he left home this morning. \\"I can't remember that right now!\\", said the wife; but then she thought for a while: \\"Oh yes, he did bring his head!\\" she said. \\"He ate cabbage with it this morning before he left.\\" A priceless Molbo-story by Ariane Schjelderup and √òyvind Olsholt buf.no.

The largest peninsulas of Mols comprise Sk√∏dshoved to the west, and Helgen√¶s to the east. Mols' largest town is Ebeltoft, a town on the coast, noted for its historical town centre. Some residents of Mols or Ebeltoft will argue that Ebeltoft is not a town of Mols. The usually accepted compromise is that Ebeltoft is the market town of Mols, although not geographically situated in present-day Mols. Hills in Mols rise to 137 metres, high by Danish standards. The highest points are Agri Bavneh√∏j (137 m), Treh√∏je (127 m) and Stabelh√∏jene (135 m & 133 m). In 2008 this hilly area, Mols Bjerge (bjerge translates to \\"mountains\\"), was declared one of the first Danish national parks. It has unspoiled country, farms, rolling hills that descend to the sea, and very few large resorts.

Denmark and Mols are not densely populated, compared to central Europe, making the area uncrowded. The summer climate is mild, and it seldom gets unpleasantly hot. Situated on the eastern side of Jutland, and part of the small shallow Kattegat sea separating Denmark and Sweden, the seawater warms up fast in the summer and the coastlines are not exposed to rough tides and waves as normally experienced on the Jutlandic west coast.

The Advocate brand also includes a website. Both magazine and website have an editorial focus on news, politics, opinion, and arts and entertainment of interest to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) people. The magazine, established in 1967, is the oldest and largest LGBT publication in the United States and the only surviving one of its kind that was founded before the 1969 Stonewall riots in Manhattan, an uprising that was a major milestone in the LGBT rights movement. History Masthead from The Advocate, volume 1, issue 1 The Advocate was first published as a local newsletter by the activist group Personal Rights in Defense and Education (PRIDE) in Los Angeles. The newsletter was inspired by a police raid on a Los Angeles gay bar, the Black Cat Tavern, on January 1, 1967, and the demonstrations against police brutality in the months following that raid. Richard Mitch (using the pseudonym \\"Dick Michaels\\") and Bill Rau (under the name \\"Bill Rand\\") joined PRIDE and, along with Aristide Laurent and artist Sam Winston, transformed the newsletter into a newspaper titled The Los Angeles Advocate. The first issue bore a cover date of September 1967, and was sold for 25 cents in gay bars in Los Angeles. By early 1968, PRIDE was struggling to stay viable and Mitch and Rau paid the group one dollar for ownership of the paper in February of that year. In 1969 the newspaper was renamed The Advocate and distributed nationally. By 1974, Mitch and Rau were printing 40,000 copies for each issue. The newspaper attracted the attention of David B. Goodstein, an investment banker from San Francisco who bought the publication in 1974. Under Goodstein's direction, The Advocate transformed into a bi-weekly national news magazine covering events important to the LGBT community, including the gay rights movement, along with arts and culture. Goodstein also worked toward reducing sex-oriented advertisements in favor of more mainstream sponsors. Goodstein and Dr. Rob Eichberg created The Advocate Experience. Loosely based on the then-popular EST (Erhardt Seminars Training), it was a two-weekend, all-day series of extensive self-realization workshops to bring self-acceptance, awareness and tolerance within the LGBT community. Goodstein and Eichberg facilitated the workshops for much of their duration. Goodstein's later editorials remained strongly opposed state intervention during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. He argued even though \\"our lifestyle can become an elaborate suicidal ritual...our safety and survival depends on each of us and our individual behaviour,\\" as opposed to government public health regulations. Soon after Goodstein's death in 1985, the magazine was transformed from a tabloid-size newspaper format in two sections (with the second section carrying sexually explicit advertisements) to a standard magazine format, beginning with the October 1, 1985 issue. Breakthroughs in straight celebrity covers came under the flamboyant command of editor in chief, Richard Rouilard in the 1980s and early 1990s. After his death from AIDS, this editorial trend continued successfully with editor in chief Jeff Yarbrough. It was during this time that the magazine stopped carrying sexually explicit advertisements, and in 1992 it launched a sister publication, Advocate Classifieds. Under the leadership of its first female editor in chief, Judy Wieder, (1996‚Äî2002; editorial director, 2002-2006), The Advocate brought in a variety of voices, won numerous mainstream publishing awards, and set records for newsstand sales, circulation, and advertising. Wieder and her staff's coming-out interviews with such diverse gay luminaries as Ellen DeGeneres, George Michael, Liz Smith, Gore Vidal, Chaz Bono, Jim McGreevey, Melissa Etheridge and Rob Halford garnered the magazine much television exposure and helped to lift the status of The Advocate Interview\\" as well as the visibility of the publication. The Advocate changed hands through a series of mergers and acquisitions, first unsuccessfully with PlanetOut in 2006, and later with Here Media. In a cost-cutting move in 2008, Here Media, conceding that The Advocate print edition could no longer compete with local weekly LGBT newspapers and the Internet for hard news, switched the magazine from a bi- weekly to a monthly publication cycle. Starting in 2010, Here Media consolidated the distribution for The Advocate and Out magazines. The Advocate print version continues to be published and is available enclosed with Out as a combination package via subscription. In 2010 there were press reports of freelance writers not being paid for their work. As of May 2013, The Advocate is no longer produced in-house at Here Media but by Grand Editorial for Here Media. Grand Editorial is a contractor based in Brooklyn, New York City that also produces Out. The Advocate is now published bi-monthly with six issues per year. In 2017, Here Media sold its magazine operations to a group led by Oreva Capital, who renamed the parent company Pride Media. Zach Stafford served as the editor in chief in 2019, the first Black person to hold that role in the magazine's 50+ year history. In February 2020, Tracy E. Gilchrist was named editor in chief of The Advocate brand. Neal Broverman was named editor in chief of Advocate.com. Comics The Advocate provided a venue for several noteworthy LGBT cartoonists in the 1970s and 1980s. Early in its history the publication ran single-panel gag cartoons by Joe Johnson featuring effeminate Miss Thing and beefy Big Dick, and \\"Gayer Than Strange\\" by Sean. After these were discontinued, It's a Gay Life by Donelan debuted in 1977 and ran for 15 years. Howard Cruse's strip Wendel appeared from 1983 to 1989, transitioning from a single tabloid-size page to two magazine-size pages when the publication changed format. Leonard and Larry by Tim Barela and Servants to the Cause by Alison Bechdel also appeared briefly during the late 1980s. Podcast The Advocate produces a podcast called LGBTQ&A;, which was created and is hosted by Jeffrey Masters. The LGBTQ&A; podcast features interviews with notable LGBTQ figures such as Pete Buttigieg, Laverne Cox, Lili Reinhart, Roxane Gay and Trixie Mattel. The series features a range of LGBTQ guests including activists, politicians, and members of the entertainment industry. Awards and accolades In January 2014 The Huffington Post cited three Advocate covers in its feature, \\"23 Magazine Covers That Got It Right When Depicting Powerful Women\\": February 2011 (featuring Hillary Clinton), February 2012 (Nancy Pelosi) and January 2013 (Tammy Baldwin, .com edition).

Bethune was \\"the first [newspaper] editor in the south to openly advocate secession\\". Wiggins's name was variously reported as \\"Thomas Greene Bethune\\", \\"Thomas Wiggins\\", or \\"Thomas Bethune\\"; his name was changed due to his slave status.

Instead, he was left to play and explore the Bethune plantation. At an early age, he showed an interest in the piano after hearing the instrument played by Bethune's daughters. By age four he reportedly had acquired some piano skills by ear, and gained access to the piano. By age five Tom reportedly had composed his first tune, The Rain Storm, after a torrential downpour on a tin roof.Remembers Only Names And Dates, in the Tacoma Times, published February 24, 1904; retrieved January 19, 2015 (via Chronicling America) With his skills recognized by General Bethune, Tom was permitted to live in a room attached to the family house, equipped with a piano. Neighbor Otto Spahr, reminiscing about Tom in the Atlanta Constitution in 1908 (as reproduced in The Ballad of Blind Tom, by Deirdre O'Connell), observed: \\"Tom seemed to have but two motives in life: the gratification of his appetite and his passion for music. I don't think I exaggerate when I state that he made the piano go for twelve hours out of twenty-four.\\"Deirdre O'Connell, \\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\", (Overlook Press, 2009) As a child, Tom began to echo the sounds around him, repeating accurately the crow of a rooster or the singing of a bird. If he was left alone in the cabin, Tom was known to begin beating on pots and pans or dragging chairs across the floor in an attempt to make any kind of noise. By the age of four, Tom was able to repeat conversations up to ten minutes in length but was barely able to adequately communicate his own needs, resorting to grunts and gestures. Another example of Tom's extraordinary abilities was shown after he was taken to a political rally in 1860 in support of Democratic presidential candidate Stephen Douglas. Years after he attended this speech, he was still able to repeat it while capturing the tone and mannerisms of Douglas. Additionally, he was able to recreate the heckles and cheers of the crowd with remarkable precision. Bethune hired out \\"Blind Tom\\" from the age of eight years to concert promoter Perry Oliver, who toured him extensively in the US, performing as often as four times a day and earning Oliver and Bethune up to $100,000 a year, an enormous sum for the time, \\"The Battle of Manassas\\", Art of the States (on line) \\"equivalent to $1.5 million/year [in 2004], making Blind Tom undoubtedly the nineteenth century's most highly compensated pianist\\". General Bethune's family eventually made a fortune estimated at $750,000 at the hands of Blind Tom. Oliver marketed Tom as a \\"Barnum-style freak\\" advertising the transformation from animal to artist. In the media, Tom was frequently compared to a bear, baboon, or mastiff. Bethune hired professional musicians to play for Tom, who could faithfully reproduce their performances, often after a single listening. Eventually he learned a reported 7,000 pieces of music, including hymns, popular songs, waltzes, and classical repertoire. Professional career Blind Tom Wiggins seated Blind Tom There are conflicting historical accounts of Blind Tom's first public performance, some indicating he was as young as three. One account from 1857 indicates that he had been performing publicly for several years. Newspaper reviews and audience reactions were favorable, prompting General Bethune to undertake a concert tour with Tom around their home state of Georgia. Tom later toured the South with Bethune or accompanied by hired managers, though their travels and bookings were sometimes hampered by the North-South hostilities which were drawing the nation towards Civil War. In 1860, Blind Tom performed at the White House before President James Buchanan; he was the first African-American to give a command performance at the White House. Mark Twain attended many of Blind Tom's performances over several decades and chronicled the proceedings. On- and off-stage, Tom often referred to himself in the third person (e.g., \\"Tom is pleased to meet you\\"). His piano recitals were augmented by other talents, including uncanny voice mimicry of public figures and nature sounds. He also displayed a hyperactive physicality both onstage and off. A letter written in 1862 by a soldier in North Carolina described some of Tom's eccentric capabilities: \\"One of his most remarkable feats was the performance of three pieces of music at once. He played 'Fisher's Hornpipe' with one hand and 'Yankee Doodle' with the other and sang 'Dixie' all at once. He also played a piece with his back to the piano and his hands inverted.\\" At concerts, skeptics attempted to confirm if Tom's performance replications were mere trickery; their challenge took the form of having Tom hear and repeat two new, uncirculated compositions. Tom did so perfectly. The \\"audience challenge\\" eventually became a regular feature of his concerts. Supposedly, Tom's talents profited the Confederacy during the Civil War. His most famous song, \\"The Battle of Manassas\\", is the story of the Confederate Army's 1861 victory at the Battle of Bull Run. As a result, many black newspapers refused to celebrate him, pointing out that he served to reinforce negative stereotypes about African-American individuals and that he was only a source of profit for slaveholders. The Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 freed all slaves in the Confederate states; all US slaves were not freed until the Thirteenth Amendment passed in December 1865. In 1866, at age 16, Tom was taken on a European concert tour by General Bethune, who collected testimonials about Tom's natural talents from composer-pianist Ignaz Moscheles and pianist- conductor Charles Hall√©. These were printed in a booklet, \\"The Marvelous Musical Prodigy Blind Tom\\", and used to bolster Tom's international reputation. In 1875, General Bethune transferred management of Blind Tom's professional affairs to his son John Bethune, who accompanied Tom on tour around the U.S. for the next eight years. Beginning in 1875, John brought Blind Tom to New York each summer. While living with John in a boarding house on the Lower East Side, Tom added to his repertoire under the tutelage of Joseph Poznanski, who also transcribed new compositions by Tom for publication. Many of these were, at Tom's insistence, published under such pseudonyms as Professor W.F. Raymond, J.C. Beckel, C.T. Messengale, and Francois Sexalise. Tom's piano-playing behavior, both during practice and performance, was eccentric. \\"We had two pianos in one room\\", Poznanski told the Washington Post in 1886 (as recounted in O'Connell's biography). \\"I would play for him and he would get up, walk around, stand on one foot, pull his hair, knock his head against the wall, then sit down and play a very good imitation of what I had played with additions to it. His memory was something prodigious. He never forgot anything.\\" This led some critics to dismiss Tom as a novelty act, a \\"human parrot.\\" Novelist Willa Cather, writing in the Nebraska State Journal, called Tom \\"a human phonograph, a sort of animated memory, with sound producing power.\\" John Steinbeck has compared the main character in a short story of his, \\"Johnny Bear\\", to Blind Tom. No original recordings of Blind Tom appear to exist. His sheet music is available, but only a small number of musicians have ever recorded his original songs. Custody battle In 1882, John Bethune married his landlady, Eliza Stutzbach, who had demonstrated a knack for mollifying Tom's sometimes volatile temperament. However, shortly after their marriage, John Bethune embarked on an extended tour of the U.S. with Tom, in effect abandoning Eliza. When Bethune returned home eight months later, his wife filed for divorce. The couple split up‚ÄîJohn took Tom‚Äîbut a bitter legal squabble ensued, with Eliza hounding John for financial support, a claim that the courts usually adjudicated in John's favor. After John Bethune died in a railway accident in 1884, Tom was returned‚Äîover Eliza's objections‚Äîto the care of General Bethune (now living in Virginia). Eliza sued General Bethune for custody, with Tom's elderly mother Charity enjoined by Eliza's attorney as a party in the plaintiff's suit. After a protracted custody battle in several courts, in August 1887 Tom was awarded to Eliza, who moved Tom back to New York. Charity accompanied them with the understanding that she would benefit financially from Tom's earnings. However, after it became apparent that Eliza did not intend to honor any financial obligations to Charity, Tom's mother returned to Georgia. Tom continued performing and touring for a number of years under the management of Eliza and her attorney (and later husband) Albrecht Lerche. Tom was on tour in western Pennsylvania in May 1889 on the day of the Johnstown Flood, and rumor spread that he was among the casualties. Despite his continued appearances on the U.S. concert circuit, the rumor persisted for years, with some observers expressing skepticism that the Blind Tom who appeared in concert after 1889 was the \\"real Blind Tom\\". In this phase of his career, Tom usually introduced himself onstage in the third person, imitating the pronouncements of his various managers from years past. He talked about his mental state with a characteristic lack of self-awareness. He had been diagnosed as non compos mentis by a doctor, and in his foggy netherworld the phrase was a matter of personal pride. Willa Cather described the poignance of one such concert: \\"It was a strange sight to see him walk out on stage with his own lips‚Äîanother man's words‚Äîintroduce himself and talk quietly about his own idiocy. There was insanity, a grotesque horribleness about it that was interestingly unpleasant. One laughs at the man's queer actions, and yet, after all, the sight is not laughable. It brings us too near to the things that we sane people do not like to think of.\\" Tom was still traveling, and presumably still performing, in 1894. On July 5 of that year, he arrived in Grand Junction, Colorado, on his way eastward from California. The trainmen at that place were on strike against the railroads as part of the Pullman Strike, and Tom was stuck in town until July 9, when he continued eastward via the Colorado Midland Railroad. After being dogged by incessant legal challenges to her custodianship of Tom, Eliza took Tom off the concert circuit in the mid-1890s. Later years General James N. Bethune and Blind TomTom spent the next ten years as a ward of Eliza and her husband, who divided their time between New York City and New Jersey's Navesink Highlands. In 1903 Eliza arranged for Tom to appear on the popular vaudeville circuit, beginning with Brooklyn's Orpheum Theater. He spent almost a year performing in vaudeville, before his health began to deteriorate. It is believed he suffered a stroke (described in some reports as \\"partial paralysis\\") in December 1904, which ended his public performing career. After the death of her husband, Eliza relocated to Hoboken, New Jersey, with Tom.Baldwin, Carly. \\"From Slave to Stage Star: \\"Blind Tom\\" Wiggins at the Hoboken Museum\\", The Star-Ledger, November 28, 2007. Accessed February 6, 2013. \\"This Saturday, December 1, at 4 p.m., the Hoboken Historical Museum welcomes scholar and musician John Davis back to Hoboken for a talk and to play recordings of the music of the 1850s pianist and music savant 'Blind Tom' Wiggins, who retired in Hoboken at the end of his career.\\" They kept out of public view, though neighbors could hear Tom's piano playing at all hours of the day and night. Tom suffered a major stroke in April 1908, and died the following June. He was buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York. Posthumous recognition The people of Columbus, Georgia, raised a commemorative headstone for him in 1976. He was the subject of a play titled HUSH: Composing Blind Tom Wiggins, by Robert Earl Price, which was performed on the Atlanta stage with Del Hamilton as director. Between 1970 and 2000, Dr. Geneva Handy Southall wrote a three-volume thesis titled Blind Tom: The Black Pianist Composer; Continuously Enslaved; it was published by Scarecrow Press in 2002. In 1981 he was the subject of a film, Blind Tom: The Story of Thomas Bethune, directed by Mark W. Travis. In 1999 John Davis recorded an album of Tom's original compositions on a CD entitled John Davis Plays Blind Tom. The CD package included essays by Amiri Baraka, Ricky Jay and Oliver Sacks. In 2006, Reagan Grimsley published an article about preserving the sheet music of Blind Tom for future Generations. Titled \\"Discovering \\"Blind\\" Tom Wiggins: Creating Digital Access to Original Sheet Music at the Columbus State University Archives\\", it appeared in Music Reference Quarterly.

His name is sometimes written Lansberg, and his first name is sometimes given as Philip or Johannes Philippus. He published under the Latin name Philippus Lansbergius. He is best known as the author of a set of astronomical tables, Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetu√¶, for predicting planetary positions. These were later found to contain certain errors, in part because he (erroneously) did not accept Kepler's discovery of elliptical orbits. He served as a Protestant clergyman. Martinus Hortensius was one of his students, and Landsberge subsequently collaborated with his former pupil. He was born in Ghent in modern-day Belgium in 1561. He grew up in France and studied in England. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he moved to the northern part of the Netherlands. He stayed in Leiden for a short time, and then he went to Goes to become a preacher. Lansbergen lived there until 1613. In that year, he was fired because he did not agree with a mayoral election. The fifty-two-year-old Lansbergen decided to move to Middelburg to devote himself to astronomical research, which he did until the end of his life. Lansbergen supported the heliocentric theory of Copernicus, who claimed that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This theory was controversial in both Catholic and Protestant circles, where the geocentric theory had been more widely held. He married Sara Lievaerts in 1586 and they had six sons and four daughters. He had a great reputation, because of his rare knowledge and expertise. Not only in matters of the church, but even more in mathematics and physics. In 1611, his son Pieter (1587) became a preacher in Goes. Jacob, another son, moved to Goes as well, but became a medical doctor. Lansbergens' oldest son, also called Philippus, was a preacher in Kloetinge and died there in 1647. Lansbergen wrote several books. One of those, \\"Considerations about the daily and yearly movements of the Earth\\", became a best-seller. One could say that Lansbergen was the first Dutch author that wrote a popular book about the movements of the planets around the Sun. Kepler and Galileo, who lived in the same period, were very interested in the work of Lansbergen. Based on his tables, they could predict the movements of the planets more accurately. (citation needed) Lansbergen probably lived in the \\"Spanjaardstraat\\" in Middelburg. He had frequent contacts with sympathizers, like the Dutch poet Jacob Cats. Cats wrote three poems about the \\"very wise, famous, and honored Philippus Lansbergen\\". He died in Middelburg in December 1632. The Philippus Lansbergen Public Observatory in Middleburg is named after him, and so is the lunar crater Lansberg.

A pyramidal peak, sometimes called a glacial horn in extreme cases, is an angular, sharply pointed mountain peak which results from the cirque erosion due to multiple glaciers diverging from a central point. Pyramidal peaks are often examples of nunataks. Formation Cross-section of cirque erosion over time Glaciers, typically forming in drainages on the sides of a mountain, develop bowl-shaped basins called cirques (sometimes called ‚Äòcorries‚Äô - from Scottish Gaelic _coire_ [k ∞…ô…æ…ô] (a bowl) - or s). Cirque glaciers have rotational sliding that abrades the floor of the basin more than walls and that causes the bowl shape to form. As cirques are formed by glaciation in an alpine environment, the headwall and ridges between parallel glaciers called ar√™tes become more steep and defined. This occurs due to freeze/thaw and mass wasting beneath the ice surface. It is widely held that a common cause for headwall steepening and extension headward is the crevasses known as bergschrund that occur between the moving ice and the headwall. Plucking and shattering can be seen here by those exploring the crevasses. A cirque is exposed when the glacier that created it recedes. alt= When three or more of these cirques converge on a central point, they create a pyramid-shaped peak with steep walls. These horns are a common shape for mountain tops in highly glaciated areas. The number of faces of a horn depends on the number of cirques involved in the formation of the peak: three to four is most common. Horns with more than four faces include the Weissmies and the M√∂nch. A peak with four symmetrical faces is called a Matterhorn (after The Matterhorn). The peak of a glacial horn will often outlast the ar√™tes on its flanks. As the rock around it erodes, the horn gains in prominence. Eventually, a glacial horn will have near vertical faces on all sides. In the Alps, \\"horn\\" is also the name of very exposed peaks with slope inclinations of 45-60¬∞ (e.g. Kitzb√ºheler Horn).

Etymology Etymologically, the word is a combination of the Sanskrit words bodhi and citta. Bodhi means \\"awakening\\" or \\"enlightenment\\". Citta derives from the Sanskrit root cit, and means \\"that which is conscious\\" (i.e., mind or consciousness). Bodhicitta may be translated as \\"awakening mind\\" or \\"mind of enlightenment\\". Spontaneity Bodhicitta is a spontaneous wish to attain enlightenment motivated by great compassion for all sentient beings, accompanied by a falling away of the attachment to the illusion of an inherently existing self. The mind of great compassion and bodhicitta motivates one to attain enlightenment Buddhahood, as quickly as possible and benefit infinite sentient beings through their emanations and other skillful means. Bodhicitta is a felt need to replace others' suffering with bliss. Since the ultimate end of suffering is nirvana, bodhicitta necessarily involves a motivation to help others to awaken (to find bodhi). A person who has a spontaneous realization or motivation of bodhicitta is called a bodhisattva. Levels Different schools may demonstrate alternative understandings of bodhicitta. Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche and Surya Das, both Nyingma masters of the non-sectarian Rime movement, distinguish between relative and absolute (or ultimate) bodhicitta. Relative bodhicitta is a state of mind in which the practitioner works for the good of all beings as if it were their own. Absolute bodhicitta is the wisdom of shunyata (≈õunyatƒÅ, a Sanskrit term often translated as \\"emptiness\\", though the alternatives \\"vast expanse\\" or \\"openness\\" or \\"spaciousness\\" probably convey the idea better to Westerners). The concept of ≈õunyatƒÅ in Buddhism also implies freedom from attachments and from fixed ideas about the world and how it should be. Some bodhicitta practices emphasize the absolute (e.g. vipa≈õyanƒÅ), while others emphasize the relative (e.g. metta), but both aspects are seen in all MahƒÅyƒÅna practice as essential to enlightenment, especially in the Tibetan practices of tonglen and lojong. Without the absolute, the relative can degenerate into pity and sentimentality, whereas the absolute without the relative can lead to nihilism and lack of desire to engage other sentient beings for their benefit. In his book Words of My Perfect Teacher, the Tibetan Buddhist teacher Patrul Rinpoche describes three degrees of bodhicitta: The way of the King, who primarily seeks his own benefit but who recognizes that his benefit depends crucially on that of his kingdom and his subjects. The path of the boatman, who ferries his passengers across the river and simultaneously, of course, ferries himself as well, and finally that of the shepherd, who makes sure that all his sheep arrive safely ahead of him and places their welfare above his own. The last, the way of the shepherd, is according to Patrul Rinpoche the best and highest way. Origins and development  Early MahƒÅyƒÅna Paul Williams describes bodhicitta in Tibetan Buddhism, referring to early MahƒÅyƒÅna works, as a bodhisattva mind state to carry out actions: Late MahƒÅyƒÅna texts Among the most important later Tibetan Buddhism source texts on bodhicitta are: * ≈öƒÅntideva's A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way Of Life (c. 700 CE), * Thogme Zangpo's Thirty-Seven Practices of a Bodhisattva (12th century CE), * Langri Tangpa's Eight Verses for Training the Mind (c. 1100 CE), and * Geshe Chekhawa Training the Mind in Seven Points in the 12th century CE. Practice Mahayana Buddhism propagates the Bodhisattva-ideal, in which the Six perfections are being practiced continuously. Arousing and aspiring in the Paramitra's application, are part of this Bodhisattva-ideal to bodhicitta. Ideal In MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna Buddhism, the goal of Buddhist practice is primarily to be reborn infinite numbers of times to liberate all those other beings still trapped in samsƒÅra. Bodhicitta nature meditation, its degrees, and intentional precepts, and action, with a dedication to achieving Buddhahood is an ancient Tibetian Buddhist wisdom method. PƒÅramitƒÅ-s MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism teaches that the broader motivation of achieving one's own enlightenment \\"in order to help all sentient beings\\" is the best possible motivation one can have for any action, whether it be working in one's vocation, teaching others, or even making an incense offering. The Six Perfections (PƒÅramitƒÅs) of Buddhism only become true \\"perfections\\" when they are done with the motivation of bodhicitta. Thus, the action of giving (Skt. dƒÅna) can be done in a mundane sense, or it can be a PƒÅramitƒÅ if it is conjoined with bodhicitta. Bodhicitta is the primary positive factor to be cultivated. Cultivation The MahƒÅyƒÅna-tradition provides specific methods for the intentional cultivation of both absolute and relative bodhicitta. This cultivation is considered to be one of the most difficult aspects of the path to complete awakening. Practitioners of the MahƒÅyƒÅna make it their primary goal to develop a genuine, uncontrived bodhicitta which remains within their mindstreams continuously without having to rely on conscious effort. The foundation is faith, taking refuge, and arousing bodhicitta. Among the many methods for developing uncontrived Bodhicitta given in MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings are: * A. So as to arouse Bodhicitta, the main aspect, the Four Immeasurables (Brahmavihara) contemplation and practice: ** Immeasurable Equanimity (Upek·π£ƒÅ) ** Immeasurable Loving-Kindness (Maitrƒ´), ** Immeasurable Compassion (KarunƒÅ), ** Immeasurable Joy in the Good Fortune of Others (Mudita), and * B. So as to aspire Bodhicitta: ** The Lojong (mind training) practices: *** Others as equal to self: Exchanging self and others: (Tonglen) the Sending and Receiving while breathing practice, *** Others as more important: Viewing all other sentient beings as having been our mothers in infinite past lives, and feeling gratitude for the many occasions on which they have taken care of us. * C. So as to apply Bodhicitta and achieve enlightenment: ** The repeated PƒÅramitƒÅs practice cycle: 1) Generosity, 2) Virtue, 3) Patience, 4) Effort, 5) Meditation, and 6) Insight. In Lojong's 59 slogans, Point Two: The main practice, which is training in absolute and relative bodhicitta. : A. Absolute Bodhicitta :Slogan 2. Regard all dharmas as dreams; although experiences may seem solid, they are passing memories. :Slogan 3. Examine the nature of unborn awareness. :Slogan 4. Self-liberate even the antidote. :Slogan 5. Rest in the nature of alaya, the essence, the present moment. :Slogan 6. In post- meditation, be a child of illusion. : B.Relative Bodhicitta :Slogan 7. Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. These two should ride the breath (aka. practice Tonglen). :Slogan 8. Three objects, three poisons, three roots of virtue -- The 3 objects are friends, enemies and neutrals. The 3 poisons are craving, aversion and indifference. The 3 roots of virtue are the remedies. :Slogan 9. In all activities, train with slogans. :Slogan 10. Begin the sequence of sending and taking with yourself. When only realizing ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ, the practitioner might not benefit others, so the Mahayana path unites emptiness and compassion, this keeps from falling into the two limits and remaining on the middle way. Traditionally, Bodhisattvas practice mediative concentration at the beginning toward attaining the noble one's wisdom level, then the main practice becomes benefiting others spontaneously, unlike other paths that might discontinue benefiting others. All the conducive causes and auspicious conditions should be complete for bodhicitta to properly arise. After continued training, these qualities can arise in the mind without contrivance. The two main traditions in taking the Bodhicitta vows are: 1) Nagarjuna's profound view chariot and, 2) Asanga's vast conduct chariot. After which this is guarded with what to avoid, and what to adopt. The practice can be divided into three parts: 1) mind training, 2) arousing bodhicitta, and 3) training in what to adopt and what to avoid. These can be called the 1) preliminary practice, 2) main practice, and 3) concluding practice. The preliminary practice is training in the four boundless qualities. The main practice is arousing Bodhicitta and taking vows. The concluding practice is training in what to adopt and guarding without fail against what to avoid. The Ancient Tibetan school preliminary practice cycle in the Samantabhadra to Longchenpa to Jigme Lingpa's lineage of the Excellent Part to Omniscience: Vast Expanse Heart Essence. Invocation; Confession; Faith with Refuge: Mind Series Bodhichitta nature in the channels, inner air, and ; Mandala of essence, nature, and compassion; Generation: Illusory perceptions like the moon reflecting in the water. Follow like Manjushree to dedicate with the aspiration to realize the innermost meaning and realize to attain Buddhahood as a spiritual warrior. Two Practice Lineages Tibetan Buddhists maintain that there are two main ways to cultivate Bodhichitta, the \\"Seven Causes and Effects\\" that originates from Maitreya and was taught by Atisha, and \\"Exchanging Self and Others,\\" taught by Shantideva and originally by Manjushri. According to Tsongkapa the seven causes and effects are thus: #recognizing all beings as your mothers; #recollecting their kindness; #the wish to repay their kindness; #love; #great compassion; #wholehearted resolve; #bodhichitta. According to Pabongka Rinpoche the second method consists of the following meditations: #how self and others are equal; #contemplating the many faults resulting from self-cherishing; #contemplating the many good qualities resulting from cherishing others; #the actual contemplation on the interchange of self and others; #with these serving as the basis, the way to meditate on giving and taking (tonglen). Universality The practice and realization of bodhicitta are independent of sectarian considerations, since they are fundamentally a part of the human experience. Bodhisattvas are not only recognized in the TheravƒÅda school of Buddhism, but in all other religious traditions and among those of no formal religious tradition. The present fourteenth Dalai Lama, for instance, regarded Mother Teresa as one of the greatest modern bodhisattvas.

Work with Norman Lear Hemsley with The Jeffersons co-stars Isabel Sanford and Mike Evans While Hemsley was on Broadway with Purlie, Norman Lear called him in 1971 to play the recurring role of George Jefferson in his new sitcom, All in the Family. Hemsley was reluctant to leave his theatre role, but Lear told him that he would hold the role open for him. Hemsley joined the cast two years later. The characters of Hemsley and co-star Isabel Sanford were supporting occasional roles on All in the Family, but were given their own spin-off, The Jeffersons, two years after Hemsley made his debut on the sitcom. The Jeffersons proved to be one of Lear's most successful series, enjoying a run of 11 seasons through 1985. 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s Hemsley continued to work steadily after the show's cancellation, largely typecast in George Jefferson-like roles. He teamed with the sitcom's original cast members when The Jeffersons moved to Broadway for a brief run. He later joined the cast of NBC's Amen in 1986 as Deacon Ernest Frye, a church deacon. The sitcom enjoyed a run of five seasons, ending in 1991. Hemsley then was a voice actor in the ABC live-action puppet series Dinosaurs, where he played Bradley P.

He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2012. Music career In 1989, Hemsley, who had been a jazz keyboardist, released a single, \\"Ain't That a Kick in the Head\\". This was followed in 1992 with Dance, an album of rhythm and blues music. He appeared on Soul Train around the time of the record's release and also performed the song \\"Eyes in the Dark\\".Sherman Hemsley performs \\"Eyes in the Dark\\" on Soul Train (1992) , Bing.com; accessed October 8, 2016. Hemsley was an enthusiastic fan of 1970s progressive rock bands, including Yes, Gentle Giant, Gong, and Nektar. Personal life and death Hemsley was a shy and intensely private man, described by some as reclusive. He avoided the Hollywood limelight and little of his personal life was public knowledge beyond the facts that he never married and he had no children. In 2003, however, Hemsley granted a rare video interview to the Archive of American Television. \\"It [playing George Jefferson] was hard for me. But he was the character. I had to do it.\\"Sherman Hemsley of 'The Jefferson's' fame, found dead in El Paso , alamogordonews.com; accessed September 28, 2016. On July 24, 2012, Hemsley died at his home in El Paso, Texas, at age 74. The cause of death was given as superior vena cava syndrome, a complication associated with lung and bronchial carcinomas. He had a malignant mass on one of his lungs for which chemotherapy and radiation had been recommended, according to the El Paso County Texas Medical Examiner's report.\\"'The Jeffersons' star Sherman Hemsley found dead at home\\", indianexpress.com; accessed September 28, 2016. Sherman Hemsley marker Aftermath On August 28, 2012, an El Paso news anchor interviewed Flora Isela Enchinton, the sole beneficiary of Hemsley's will, who said that the two were friends and had been business partners for more than two decades. During this time she lived with Hemsley and his friend Kenny Johnston. Enchinton told the Associated Press that Hemsley never mentioned any relatives. \\"Some people come out of the woodwork‚Äîthey think Sherman, they think money\\", Enchinton told AP. \\"But the fact is that I did not know Sherman when he was in the limelight. I met them when they [Hemsley and Johnston] came running from Los Angeles with not one penny, when there was nothing but struggle.\\" A Philadelphia man named Richard Thornton claimed to be Hemsley's brother and the true heir to his estate. After contesting the will, Thornton halted progress on funeral arrangements, and as a result, Hemsley's body remained at the San Jose Funeral Home in El Paso and unburied for months. On November 9, 2012, the legal battle over Hemsley's body ended when Judge Patricia Chew ruled in favor of Enchinton. A military funeral was planned for Hemsley. He was interred at Fort Bliss National Cemetery in his adopted hometown of El Paso.

Its central area is surrounded by a cluster of flat-topped peaks roughly corresponding to the cardinal directions. The north peak (Beitai Ding or Yedou Feng) is the highest () and is also the highest point in northern China. As host to over 53 sacred monasteries, Mount Wutai is home to many of China's most important monasteries and temples. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009China‚Äôs sacred Buddhist Mount Wutai inscribed on UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage List. UNESCO World Heritage Centre and named a AAAAA tourist attraction by China's National Tourism Administration in 2007. Significance Mount Wutai is one of the Four Sacred Mountains in Chinese Buddhism. Each of the mountains is viewed as the bodhima·πá·∏ça () of one of the four great bodhisattvas. W«ît√°i is the home of the Bodhisattva of wisdom, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ or \\"\\" () in Chinese. Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations. 2000. p. 227 Wutai was the first of the mountains to be identified and is often referred to as \\"first among the four great mountains\\". It was identified on the basis of a passage in the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra, which describes the abodes of many bodhisattvas. In this chapter, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is said to reside on a \\"clear cold mountain\\" in the northeast. This served as charter for the mountain's identity and its alternate name \\"Clear Cool Mountain\\" (). The bodhisattva is believed to frequently appear on the mountain, taking the form of ordinary pilgrims, monks, or most often unusual five-colored clouds. Reflecting regional rivalries between Buddhist centers, 9th-century Chan Buddhism master Linji Yixuan criticized the prominence of Wutai in Tang dynasty China. According to the posthumously compiled L√≠nj√¨ y«îl√π, Linji Yixuan once said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äòs a bunch of students who seek Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ on Mount Wutai. Wrong from the start! There‚Äòs no Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ on Mount Wutai.‚Äú His campaign was however not successful, and even after the Tang era Mount Wutai ‚Äúcontinued to thrive as perhaps the single most famous Buddhist sacred site in China.‚Äù Mount Wutai has an enduring relationship with Tibetan Buddhism.Tuttle, Gray (2006). 'Tibetan Buddhism at Ri bo rtse lnga/Wutai shan in Modern Times.' Journal of the International Association of Tibetan Studies, no. 2 (August 2006): 1-35. Source: (accessed: Monday, July 1, 2013) Mount Wutai is home to some of the oldest wooden buildings in China that have survived since the era of the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907). This includes the main hall of Nanchan Temple and the East Hall of Foguang Temple, built in 782 and 857, respectively. They were discovered in 1937 and 1938 by a team of architectural historians including the prominent early 20th-century historian Liang Sicheng. The architectural designs of these buildings have since been studied by leading sinologists and experts in traditional Chinese architecture, such as Nancy Steinhardt. Steinhardt classified these buildings according to the hall types featured in the Yingzao Fashi Chinese building manual written in the 12th century. In 2008, there were complaints from local residents that, in preparation for Mount Wutai's bid to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, they were forced from their homes and relocated away from their livelihoods. Major temples Nanshan Temple () is a large temple in Mount W«ît√°i, first built in the Yuan Dynasty. The whole temple comprises seven terraces, divided into three parts. The lower three terraces are named Jile Temple (); the middle terrace is called Shande Hall (); the upper three terraces are named Youguo Temple (). Other major temples include Xiantong Temple, Tayuan Temple and Pusading Temple. Other important temples inside Mount Wutai include Shouning Temple, Bishan Temple, Puhua Temple, Dailuo Ding, Qixian Temple, Shifang Tang, Shuxiang Temple, Guangzong Temple, Youguo Temple, Guanyin Dong, Longhua Temple, Luomuhou Temple, Jinge Temple, Zhanshan Temple, Wanfo Ge, Guanhai Temple, Zhulin Temple, Jifu Temple, and Gufo Temple. Outer Mount Wutai temples include Yanqing Temple, Nanchan Temple, Mimi Temple, Foguang Temple, Yanshan Temple, Zunsheng Temple, and Guangji Temple. A giant statue of Maha Manjushree was presented to the Buddhists of China by foreign minister of Nepal Ramesh Nath Pandey in 2005.

A hoard or \\"wealth deposit\\" is an archaeological term for a collection of valuable objects or artifacts, sometimes purposely buried in the ground, in which case it is sometimes also known as a cache. This would usually be with the intention of later recovery by the hoarder; hoarders sometimes died or were unable to return for other reasons (forgetfulness or physical displacement from its location) before retrieving the hoard, and these surviving hoards might then be uncovered much later by metal detector hobbyists, members of the public, and archaeologists. Hoards provide a useful method of providing dates for artifacts through association as they can usually be assumed to be contemporary (or at least assembled during a decade or two), and therefore used in creating chronologies. Hoards can also be considered an indicator of the relative degree of unrest in ancient societies. Thus conditions in 5th and 6th century Britain spurred the burial of hoards, of which the most famous are the Hoxne Hoard, Suffolk; the Mildenhall Treasure, the Fishpool Hoard, Nottinghamshire, the Water Newton hoard, Cambridgeshire, and the Cuerdale Hoard, Lancashire, all preserved in the British Museum. Prudence Harper of the Metropolitan Museum of Art voiced some practical reservations about hoards at the time of the Soviet exhibition of Scythian gold in New York City in 1975. Writing of the so-called \\"Maikop treasure\\" (acquired from three separate sources by three museums early in the twentieth century, the Berliner Museen, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and the Metropolitan Museum, New York, N.Y.), Harper warned: Such \\"dealer's hoards\\" can be highly misleading, but better understanding of archaeology amongst collectors, museums and the general public is gradually making them less common and more easily identified.  Classification  Treasure of Villena, 1000 BC, the second biggest prehistoric gold hoard in Europe. Discovered in 1963. Hoards may be of precious metals, coinage, tools or less commonly, pottery or glass vessels. There are various classifications depending on the nature of the hoard. A founder's hoard contains broken or unfit metal objects, ingots, casting waste, and often complete objects, in a finished state. These were probably buried with the intention to be recovered at a later time. A merchant's hoard is a collection of various functional items which, it is conjectured, were buried by a traveling merchant for safety, with the intention of later retrieval. A personal hoard is a collection of personal objects buried for safety in times of unrest. A hoard of loot is a buried collection of spoils from raiding and is more in keeping with the popular idea of \\"buried treasure\\". Votive hoards are different from the above in that they are often taken to represent permanent abandonment, in the form of purposeful deposition of items, either all at once or over time for ritual purposes, without intent to recover them. Furthermore, votive hoards need not be \\"manufactured\\" goods, but can include organic amulets and animal remains. Votive hoards are often distinguished from more functional deposits by the nature of the goods themselves (from animal bones to diminutive artifacts), the places buried (being often associated with watery places, burial mounds and boundaries), and the treatment of the deposit (careful or haphazard placement and whether ritually destroyed/broken). Valuables dedicated to the use of a deity (and thus classifiable as \\"votive\\") were not always permanently abandoned. Valuable objects given to a temple or church become the property of that institution, and may be used to its benefit.C.

In addition to the drums, Corr plays the bodhr√°n, caj√≥n, percussions and piano. The Corr siblings were appointed honorary MBEs in 2005, in recognition of their music and charitable work which has raised money for the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, victims of the Omagh Bombing and other charities.  Biography  Corr was born on St. Patrick's Day (national day of Ireland) in Dundalk, County Louth on the east coast of Ireland, 50 miles north of Dublin, to Jean and Gerry Corr. She was brought up in a Catholic household. Corr has three siblings: an older sister Sharon Corr, older brother Jim Corr and a younger sister Andrea Corr. She was sent to the same school, Dun Lughaidh Convent, as her sisters Her parents played ballads and folk tunes in local bands, and formed their own band called \\"Sound Affair\\". Jean sang and Gerry played the keyboards and they performed covers of songs by various famous bands. Caroline and her siblings were exposed to music from a very young age, and travelled with Jean and Gerry to gigs in the family estate car. Caroline was taught the piano by her father Gerry at a very early age like her other siblings. She also learnt the bodhr√°n by watching videos of traditional Irish musicians playing it. The violin was originally intended for Caroline to play but she showed no interest and instead Sharon took up violin lessons. Caroline learned to play the drums with the help of a former boyfriend who gave her lessons. From then on her drum skills were self taught. She performed No Frontiers, a cover of a Jimmy MacCarthy song, on The Corrs Unplugged along with her sister Sharon. In 2020, Corr was part of an Irish collective of female singers and musicians called \\"Irish Women in Harmony\\", that recorded a version of Dreams in aid of the charity SafeIreland, which deals with domestic abuse which had reportedly risen significantly during the Covid-19 lockdown.

It has been alleged that he owes taxes to both the Spanish and Panamanian governments. On 23 February 2017, Rato was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to 4¬Ω years' imprisonment.

Rato attended a Jesuit school before studying law in the Complutense University. In 1971 Rato went to University of California, Berkeley, and received an MBA in 1974 from the Haas School of Business. Career Early beginnings In 1975 Rato became involved in the family business, first in Fuensanta, an Asturian mineral water company, and then in two Madrid construction firms. He also became involved in expanding the Cadena Rato chain of radio stations. In 1977 Rato joined the newly formed Popular Alliance (AP), a party containing former ministers of Franco, founded by Manuel Fraga, a close personal friend of his father. In December 1979 Rato was elected to the national executive committee, and became secretary of the AP economic commission. In February 1981 he became one of the party's five Secretaries-General, and was considered to be their economic expert. He supported tight controls on public spending, and an emphasis on the supply side of economics. In October 1982 he won election as an AP member of the Congress of Deputies for C√°diz in spite of having no connection to this Andalucian town. He represented the area until 1989 and subsequently represented Madrid from 1989 to 2000. The 1982 election handed a loss to the AP, and marked the beginning of the long rule of the PSOE and Felipe Gonz√°lez. Until 1984 Rato was the Secretary of the parliamentary group. He then became their economic affairs spokesman where he impressed the party with his attacks on the PSOE's economic policies. He was seen to be on the liberal wing of the party. When Fraga resigned from the leadership in December 1986 Rato backed Miguel Herrero y Rodr√≠guez de Mi√±√≥n who lost the leadership race to Antonio Hern√°ndez Mancha, but managed to keep his positions within the party. During these years he also continued his business career in Aguas de Fuensanta; having previously been the CEO of the company from 1978 to 1982, he served as chairman from 1985 to 1991. In June 1989 Fraga again became interim President after the generally acknowledged failure of the leadership of Hern√°ndez Mancha. The party became the slightly more inclusive People's Party (PP). Rato was given shared responsibility over the elections with Francisco √Ålvarez- Cascos Fern√°ndez, the new party Secretary General. He was a close supporter of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, who was voted as the new PP leader on 4 September. On 29 October, the PP lost the general election, though his role in the campaign gave him national prominence. Afterwards he was appointed party spokesman. On 2 April 1990 his father sold the family stake in Cadena Rato for 5 billion pesetas. In June 1991 he stopped being President of Fuensanta, but remained on the board until 1993. On 6 June that year the PP lost another general election to PSOE. In the 12th National Congress in January 1996 he was confirmed as one of the three vice secretaries of the party. Minister of Economy and vice president Then on 3 March 1996 the PP won the general election. On 4 May Aznar became Prime Minister of Spain, and on 6 May Rato became both second Vice President and Minister of Economy and Finance. On 12 March 2000 the PP won again, this time with an absolute majority. His ministries were reorganised, and he gave all his responsibilities to Crist√≥bal Montoro Romero who became Minister of Finance. In his second term he had to fend off various charges of incompatibility between his public office and his private business interests. Managing Director of the IMF Rodrigo Rato meeting with The Republic of Zambia's President H. E Levy Mwanawasa (16 March 2006) Rato became the managing director of the IMF on 7 June 2004, taking over from Anne Krueger, who had been acting as temporary Managing Director after Horst K√∂hler, who at that time was nominated (and later elected) President of Germany, resigned the post 4 March 2004. In June 2007 Rato announced that he would resign from his post the following October, citing personal reasons. On 28 September 2007, the International Monetary Fund's 24 executive directors elected former French Minister for Economics, Finance, and Industry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, over former Czech Prime Minister Josef To≈°ovsk√Ω, to be the new managing director in succession to Rato. Career in the private sector Bankia Rato assumed the presidency of Caja Madrid in 2010, a public savings bank based in the Community of Madrid, and after a merger with other six saving banks he assumed the presidency of the new group now called Bankia. On 7 May 2012, he resigned amid growing concerns about the solvency of the bank. Although the core capital ratio was 10,4%, the Popular Party Government planned to lend about 8 billion euro to the bank to increase its solvency, as was done before throughout Europe (e.g. ING and Northern Rock crisis). Due to his political ties to the governing PP, which decided to inject the funds, Rato resigned. He had his salary cut from ‚Ç¨2.3 million to ‚Ç¨600,000 annually in 2011 due to new laws for rescued banks. Other activities * International Airlines Group (IAG), Member of the Board of DirectorsBoard of Directors International Airlines Group (IAG). * Mapfre, Member of the Board of Directors (2010‚Äì2012) Legal issues On 4 July 2012, Rato, along with 30 other former members of the board of directors of Bankia, were charged with accounting irregularities. Bloomberg Businessweek listed Rato as the worst CEO in 2012. In 2011, Bankia had announced profits of ‚Ç¨309 million; after Rato resigned, the figure was amended to ‚Ç¨3 billion in losses. In October 2014, it became known that between 24 October 2010 to 28 November 2011, Rato made 519 purchases with a secret corporate credit card, spending a total of ‚Ç¨99,041. Among these purchases he spent in one day were ‚Ç¨3,547 in alcoholic beverages and ‚Ç¨1,000 in shoes, along with 16 cash withdrawals of more than ‚Ç¨1,000, most of them during the last months of his presidential term. After a hearing 17 October 2014, the Spanish High Court judge Fernando Andreu assigned civil responsibility for the credit card abuse to Rodrigo Rato and Miguel Blesa. Rato was ordered to pay a bond of ‚Ç¨3 million, and was expelled from the People's Party (PP).El PP da de baja a Rato y a los 12 militantes de las tarjetas opacas. El Pa√≠s (27 October 2014). The case went to court in 2016. On 23 February 2017, Rato was convicted and sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 2020, the High Court acquitted Rato in a separate trial over falsifying accounts and other charges in the listing of Bankia when he was the bank‚Äôs chairman. It later granted him a semi-release which allowd him to serve the rest of his sentence in partial liberty.Jes√∫s Aguado and Emma Pinedo (October 1, 2020), Former IMF chief Rato to leave Spanish prison on semi- release from embezzlement sentence Reuters.

He played in MLB for the Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Toronto Blue Jays from 1998 through 2009. He is currently a host along with Chris Rose on the MLB Network show Intentional Talk, and (as of late-March 2018) the show's companion audio podcast \\"Intentional Talk: Caught Listening\\". Early life Millar was born in Los Angeles. He attended and played baseball for University High School in West Los Angeles, which won the 3-A City title in 1988 under coach Frank Cruz, during his junior year. He graduated from Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California. He attended and played college baseball for Los Angeles City College and later Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. Under the tutelage of Coach Jim Gilligan, Millar and the Cardinals prospered. For two seasons, Millar was a key part of Lamar's return to prominence in collegiate baseball. In 1992, Lamar went 32‚Äì21, posting the NCAA‚Äôs biggest turnaround with a 14-victory improvement over the 1991 season. Millar led the Cardinals that season in runs (41), hits (56), home runs (13) and runs batted in (50), and he earned All-Sun Belt Conference honors. After the 1992 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The next season, Millar helped lead the Cardinals to a 44‚Äì18 record, to the SBC regular-season and tournament championships, and also to a berth in the NCAA‚Äôs Central I Regional on the campus of Texas A&M; in College Station. Lamar would be quickly eliminated in two games, with a 6-1 loss against UCLA, followed by a 10-5 finish against Texas A&M.; Professional career In 1993, Millar began his professional career with the Saint Paul Saints of the Northern League. Replacement player Millar was a replacement player during the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike, when he played with the replacements in early 1995 and therefore, he is barred from membership in the Major League Baseball Players Association. Florida Marlins (1998‚Äì2002) From 1997 to 1999, during games encompassing several minor league stints, Millar set the record for most consecutive games reaching base with 71 straight (although this statistic only began to be formally tracked in the minors in 1996). This record was tied in 2003 by future Red Sox teammate Kevin Youkilis. His contract was purchased by the Florida Marlins at the end of the season and he made his major league debut for Florida in 1998. Boston Red Sox (2003‚Äì2005) Millar played for the Marlins from 1998 to 2002, and was later sold to the Japanese Central League Chunichi Dragons. In order for the transaction to be completed, he first had to clear the waivers requested by the Marlins, but the Red Sox broke an unwritten rule and blocked the deal with a waiver claim. In an unprecedented deal brokered by MLB, the Marlins later repaid the money that the Dragons had paid for Millar, and the Red Sox paid a similar sum to the Marlins in return for Millar. His clubhouse presence and offensive production helped spark the Red Sox to the 2003 American League Championship Series and the 2004 World Series. During the 2003 playoffs, Millar began using the phrase \\"Cowboy Up\\", and in 2004 referred to his team as \\"idiots\\" to keep teammates loose during the stretch run to the World Series Championship. Millar on September 13, 2008 Millar had a lead-off walk in the 9th inning of Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS against the Yankees, which, along with Dave Roberts' steal of 2nd base that inning, and RBI single by Bill Mueller proved to be the turning point in the series. Prior to the game, Millar was caught on camera numerous times telling reporters and his teammates \\"Don't let the Sox win tonight\\", in reference to Game 4 and in reference to the fact that Pedro Mart√≠nez and Curt Schilling were scheduled as the starting pitchers Games 5 and 6, respectively.ESPN, Four Days in October, 2010 On April 20, 2012, Millar, together with Pedro Mart√≠nez gave a toast to Fenway Park on the 100th anniversary of the ballpark. Millar and Martinez stood on top of the home dugout and gave a toast that was the largest in history, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Baltimore Orioles (2006‚Äì2008) Millar signed with the Baltimore Orioles on January 12, 2006 as a free agent. During the season, he broke Rey Ord√≥√±ez's record for most games played by any non- drafted player who started his career in the Independent Leagues during the Draft era. Initially in Baltimore, he was not an everyday player. However, when Dave Trembley took over the team, he began to play more regularly. On August 23, 2007, Millar reached base safely for the 50th consecutive game, setting a franchise record for the Orioles. On August 26, 2007 Millar's streak came to an end at 52 games. It was the 7th longest streak since 1957. Millar throwing the ceremonial first pitch for Game 7 of the 2007 American League Championship Series Toronto Blue Jays (2009) On February 11, 2009, Millar signed a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays as a non-roster invitee. He successfully made the roster, serving as a backup to first baseman Lyle Overbay. After Alex R√≠os was claimed off waivers, Millar switched his number from #30 to his former #15. Chicago Cubs (2010) On February 1, 2010, Millar agreed to a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs, with an invitation to spring training. However, on March 30, he was released by the Cubs after not making the major league team. First retirement Millar announced his retirement on April 21, 2010, though on April 27 on MLB Network Radio with Jim Duquette and Kevin Kennedy, he stated it was not official as he still wanted to play. Millar joined MLB Network as a studio analyst. On May 20, 2010, Millar also joined New England Sports Network (NESN) as a pre-game and post-game analyst. On May 22, Millar made his debut for Fox Sports and its MLB on Fox Saturday telecasts. He served as a pre-game, game break, and post- game analyst for its primetime games in the studio, as well as a fill-in color analyst for select games during the season. Return to baseball (St. Paul Saints) On May 5, 2010, Millar returned to baseball when he signed a contract with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association, the same team with whom he started his career. His contract language also allowed him to leave the team to carry out his broadcasting duties. He played six games for the Saints in 2010, and hit .208 with no home runs and two RBIs. On June 24, 2017, Millar was allowed a single at-bat for the Saints in a regular season game versus the Winnipeg Goldeyes, as part of a promotional night celebrating the Saints' 25th anniversary. Facing his first live pitching in seven years, Millar hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the second inning; the Saints went on to win the game, 8‚Äì6. Podcasting In 2018, Millar and Chris Rose began co-hosting the audio podcast \\"Intentional Talk: Caught Listening\\", produced by MLB Network. Awards After the 2001 season, Millar was awarded the Charlie Hough Good Guy Award by the Florida chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. After the 2003 season, Millar was awarded the Jackie Jensen Award, which is presented each year by the Boston chapter of the BBWAA. The award is presented to the player who best exemplifies the spirit and desire of Jackie Jensen, the former Red Sox outfielder. Movie and television appearances Chris Rose and Kevin Millar at the 2013 World Baseball Classic Millar made an appearance (in actual game footage) in the movie Fever Pitch in which he walked and was lifted for a pinch runner. Millar co-hosts the MLB Network show Intentional Talk with Chris Rose. He repeatedly uses the phrase \\"Got heeem\\" which has become a signature part of \\"Intentional Talk\\". Personal life Millar is married and has four young children. Millar currently makes his residence in Austin, Texas.http://www.lamar.edu/newsevents/cc/461_2320.htm/ Millar is the nephew of former major league outfielder Wayne Nordhagen.

It is used in planetary geology to name landform features on other planets. Scientists used vallis for old river valleys they discovered when they sent the first probes to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; finding huge river valleys in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998.

Some valles on Mars (Mangala Vallis, Athabasca Vallis, Granicus Vallis, and Tinjar Valles) clearly begin at graben. On the other hand, some of the large outflow channels begin in rubble-filled low areas, called chaos or chaotic terrain. It has been suggested that massive amounts of water were trapped under pressure beneath a thick cryosphere (layer of frozen ground), then the water was suddenly released, perhaps when the cryosphere was broken by a fault.Carr, M. 1979.

Nirgal Vallis and sapping Nirgal Vallis is one of the longest valley networks on Mars. It is so large that it is found on more than one quadrangle. Scientists are not sure about how all the ancient river valleys were formed. There is evidence that instead of rain or snow, the water that formed the valleys originated underground. One mechanism that has been advanced is sapping. In sapping, the ground just gives away as water comes out. Sapping is common in some desert areas in America's Southwest. Sapping forms alcoves and stubby tributaries. These features are visible in the picture from the Coprates quadrangle of Nigal Vallis taken with Mars Odyssey's THEMIS.

Kasei Valles  One of the most significant features of the Lunae Palus region, Kasei Valles is one of the largest outflow channels on Mars. Like other outflow channels, it was carved by liquid water, probably during gigantic floods. Kasei is about long. Some sections of Kasei Valles are wide. It begins in Echus Chasma, near Valles Marineris, and empties into Chryse Planitia, not far from where Viking 1 landed. Sacra Mensa, a large tableland divides Kasei into northern and southern channels. Scientists suggest it was formed by several episodes of flooding and maybe by some glacial activity.

White sugar, also called table sugar, granulated sugar or regular sugar, is a commonly used type of sugar, made either of beet sugar or cane sugar, which has undergone a refining process.  Description  The refining process completely removes the molasses to give the white sugar, sucrose. It has a purity higher than 99.7%. Its molecular formula is C12H22O11. White sugars produced from sugar cane and sugar beet are chemically indistinguishable: it is possible, however, to identify its origin through a carbon-13 analysis. White sugar (and some brown sugar) produced from sugar cane may be refined using bone char by a few sugar cane refiners. For this reason white sugar from sugar cane may not be vegan. Beet sugar has never been processed with bone char and is vegan. From a chemical and nutritional point of view, white sugar does not contain‚Äîin comparison to brown sugar‚Äîsome minerals (such as calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium) present in molasses, even if the quantities contained in brown sugar are not significant.

A fishing light attractor is a fishing aid which uses lights attached to structure above water or suspended underwater to attract both fish and members of their food chain to specific areas in order to harvest them. Purpose Just as fisherman seek conditions where the chance of catching fish is optimized, fish seek areas where the chance of catching their food is optimal. Most game fish seek waters that are rich in food such as smaller fish, insects or shrimp. And, it follows, that these smaller fish, insects and shrimp congregate where their food is most concentrated. Scientific research shows that all members of this food chain have eyes sensitive to the colors blue and green. This probably evolved because the water absorbs longer wavelengths (Mobley 1994; Hou, 2013). The color of the body of the water is largely based on the constituents inside, combined with the absorption spectrum of the light in water. The colored dissolved organic matter in the water will absorb blue light very fast, then green, then yellow (exponential decay with wavelength), thus give the water a brownish look. Keep in mind that the transmission window of light in the water is very narrow and red light gets absorbed very fast. See above reference for details. Fish and some members of their food chain have color receptors in their eyes optimized for the light of their ‚Äúspace‚Äù. Eyes that can see a single space color can detect changes in light intensity. This is equivalent to a world in black, white and shades of gray. In this simplest level of visual information processing, an animal can recognize that something is different in its space‚Äîi.e., that there is food or a predator ‚Äúover there‚Äù. Most animals living in a lighted world have an additional visual resource: color vision. By definition, that requires that they have color receptors containing at least two different visual pigments. To efficiently perform this function in water illuminated with light, an aquatic animal would have visual pigments sensitive to the background ‚Äúspace‚Äù color and one or more visual pigments offset from this blue-green region, say, in the red or ultraviolet region of the spectrum. This imparts a clear survival advantage to these animals because they can detect not only changes in light intensity but also contrasts in color. Many fish, for example, have two color receptors, one in the blue region of the spectra (425-490 nm) and the other in the near UV (320-380 nm). Insects and shrimp, members of the fish food chain, have blue, green (530 nm) and near UV receptors. In fact, some aquatic animals have up to ten different classes of visual pigment in their eyes. By comparison, humans have three with maximum sensitivities in the blue (442 nm), green (543 nm) and yellow (570 nm). It is the differential responses of these receptor cells that enable color vision. It has been known for a long time that a light attracts fish, shrimp and insects at night. But what is the best color for a light attractor? Based on the biology of visual receptors discussed above, the light should be blue or green ‚Äî the space colors of fish and members of their food chain. However, while blue or green light is desirable it is not essential. Even if the eyes of fish or members of its food chain have color receptors most sensitive to the blue or green, these same receptors have a broad but decreased sensitivity to other colors. So, if a fishing light source is intense enough, other light colors will also attract. For example, a sodium vapor light with its characteristic yellow color will attract fish ‚Äî if intense enough. A fishing light attractor can also be white light because a portion of its total energy is in the blue to green region. The perfect fishing light would have the following properties: 1) high intensity, 2) emit its light in a color similar to the fishes space (blue or green), 3) be powered by a portable electrical supply and 4) be submersible. The last attribute is desirable because significant amounts of light energy from land- or boat-mounted lights are lost by reflection off the surface of the water. No commercial light satisfies all four of these criteria. For example, many high intensity lights such as tungsten-halogen (incandescent), medium pressure mercury or metal-halide discharge lights are so power hungry that they can only be operated for very short periods of time on a battery, thus compromising convenient portability. While LEDs and fluorescent lights draw much less electrical energy, most are not very bright. Further, many of the above lights cannot be submerged in water without risk of electrical shock or damage to the light system. Types submerged lamp used as a fish attractant. Fishing lights fall into two different groups: those that are portable and those that are permanently mounted. Generally, portable lights are powered by batteries and this sets practical limits to the kind of light that can be used. Most portable light sources are relatively low in light intensity and have short operating times. Lights drawing more than a few tens of watts are not practical. The old classic, a 12 volt automobile incandescent headlight mounted on a Styrofoam float ring, is probably the least expensive and lasts for a few hours before the battery is discharged. Battery-operated fluorescent lamps are three times more efficient in converting electricity to light. Therefore, comparing lamps of similar brightness, they can be operated about three times longer before the battery is discharged. Also, the operating lifetime of fluorescent lights are about ten times longer than incandescent lights. Commercial portable fishing lights based on fluorescent lamps vary widely in intensity. The best use 25-40 watt lamps that emit about 1000‚Äì3000 lumens per tube. Costing $100‚Äì$200, they are available through the internet, sport stores and catalogs. Permanent lights are typically powered with 115 volt house current. Placed on poles at the end of a dock or pier, the least expensive lights for outdoor use are security or flood lights using a mercury vapor, high pressure sodium vapor, metal-halide discharge or fluorescent bulb. They cost $25 to $100. While lower cost 115 V AC outdoor flood lights using standard tungsten (incandescent) or tungsten-halogen (quartz) bulbs can also be effective fish attractors, they are energy inefficient. It takes about five 100 watt tungsten lamps to deliver the light equivalent of one security lamp. Security lights are readily available from most hardware or farm supply stores. The fixture includes a photocell controller for automatic dusk-to-dawn operation and comes complete with an appropriate bulb. Most of these lights are bright (6-8 thousand lumens), efficient in converting electricity to light (operated daily for 8 hours, electrical supply costs $40‚Äì$100 per year), have long bulb lifetimes (24,000 hours) and stand up well to outside weather conditions. When used as a fishing light, light output can be redirected toward the water by installing a 5‚Äù X 10‚Äù piece of aluminum flashing or heavy foil bent into a half circle and placed next to the lamp's circular acrylic lens. Flood lights made up of LED lights (Light Emitting Diodes) are an up- and-comer. They are extremely efficient in converting electrical energy to light. Their brightness, arranged as large arrays of LEDs, can now provide up to 36,000 Lumens per fixture, a value quite sufficient to function as a fishing light. Currently available via the internet and some specialty stores, they sell for $120 - $350. Stadium spot lights are energy efficient and their superior brightness illuminates a large area of water. Rated at 250, 400, 1000 and 1500 watts, the high intensity metal-halide discharge lamp, parabola- shaped reflector and light ballast are each sold separately. A complete light fixture and lamp costs about $400‚Äì$500. The cost of lamps with different wattage ratings are similar, so most people chose higher wattage lamps. The bulbs in these lamps can emit white, blue-green, green or yellow light. For most fishing waters the lamp color of choice is green, but all colors are effective in attracting fish. They are available through specialty light stores. It takes two people to install these big lamps and the installation may also include a switch, timer, heavy gauge wiring and a circuit breaker, thus adding to the cost. As mentioned earlier, a significant fraction of the light shining on the surface of the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible fishing lights are available on the internet. The power ballast and lamp housing is mounted on a pole in a dry location. The lamp, potted in a waterproof housing, is connected to the ballast via a waterproof cable. Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned underwater by weights on its submerged power supply cord. The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of a submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough during operation to prevent establishment of marine growth on its surface. If the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated every night for at least an hour, occasional manual cleaning is required. A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the location of increasing concentrations of bait fish attracted to the light. Once discovered, the fish return regularly ‚Äî often arriving at predictable times of the evening. A painting by showing fire being used to attract fish \\"Sulfuric fire fishing\\" is a traditional technique practiced in Taiwan where acetylene is burned to attract fish.

More abstractly, it is the study of semimetric spaces and the isometric transformations between them. In this view, it can be considered as a subject within general topology. Historically, the first result in distance geometry is Heron's formula in 1st century AD. The modern theory began in 19th century with work by Arthur Cayley, followed by more extensive developments in the 20th century by Karl Menger and others. Distance geometry problems arise whenever one needs to infer the shape of a configuration of points (relative positions) from the distances between them, such as in biology, sensor network, surveying, navigation, cartography, and physics.  Introduction and definitions  The concepts of distance geometry will first be explained by describing two particular problems.Problem of hyperbolic navigation  First problem: hyperbolic navigation  Consider three ground radio stations A, B, C, whose locations are known. A radio receiver is at an unknown location. The times it takes for a radio signal to travel from the stations to the receiver, {\\\\displaystyle t_{A},t_{B},t_{C}} , are unknown, but the time differences, {\\\\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{B}} and {\\\\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{C}} , are known. From them, one knows the distance differences c({\\\\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{B}}) and c({\\\\displaystyle t_{A}-t_{C}}) , from which the position of the receiver can be found.  Second problem: dimension reduction In data analysis, one is often given a list of data represented as vectors \\\\mathbf{v} = (x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and one needs to find out whether they lie within a low- dimensional affine subspace. A low-dimensional representation of data has many advantages, such as saving storage space, computation time, and giving better insight into data.  Definitions  Now we formalize some definitions that naturally arise from considering our problems. = Semimetric space = Given a list of points on R = {P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n}, n \\\\ge 0, we can arbitrarily specify the distances between pairs of points by a list of d_{ij}> 0, 0 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n. This defines a semimetric space: a metric space without triangle inequality. Explicitly, we define a semimetric space as a nonempty set R equipped with a semimetric d: R\\\\times R \\\\to [0, \\\\infty) such that, for all x, y\\\\in R, # Positivity: d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y. # Symmetry: d(x, y) = d(y, x). Any metric space is a fortiori a semimetric space. In particular, \\\\mathbb{R}^k, the k-dimensional Euclidean space, is the canonical metric space in distance geometry. The triangle inequality is omitted in the definition, because we do not want to enforce more constraints on the distances d_{ij} than the mere requirement that they be positive. In practice, semimetric spaces naturally arises from inaccurate measurements. For example, given three points A, B, C on a line, with d_{AB} = 1, d_{BC} = 1, d_{AC} = 2, an inaccurate measurement could give d_{AB} = 0.99, d_{BC} = 0.98, d_{AC} = 2.00, violating the triangle inequality. = Isometric embedding = Given two semimetric spaces, (R, d), (R', d'), an isometric embedding from R to R' is a map f: R \\\\to R' that preserves the semimetric, that is, for all x, y\\\\in R, d(x, y) = d'(f(x), f(y)). For example, given the finite semimetric space (R, d) defined above, an isometric embedding into is defined by points A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n \\\\in {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{k}}, such that d(A_i, A_j) = d_{ij} for all 0 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n. = Affine independence = Given the points A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n \\\\in {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^k}, they are defined to be affinely independent, iff they cannot fit inside a single l-dimensional affine subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}^k, for any l < n, iff the n-simplex they span, v_n, has positive n-volume, that is, Vol_n(v_n) > 0. In general, when k\\\\ge n , they are affinely independent, since a generic n-simplex is nondegenerate. For example, 3 points in the plane, in general, are not collinear, because the triangle they span does not degenerate into a line segment. Similarly, 4 points in space, in general, are not coplanar, because the tetrahedron they span does not degenerate into a flat triangle. When n > k, they must be affinely dependent. This can be seen by noting that any n-simplex that can fit inside \\\\mathbb{R}^k must be \\"flat\\". Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinants Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinants, named after Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger, are determinants of matrices of distances between sets of points. Let A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n be n + 1 points in a semimetric space, their Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinant is defined by CM(A_0, \\\\cdots, A_n) = \\\\begin{vmatrix} 0 & d_{01}^2 & d_{02}^2 & \\\\cdots & d_{0n}^2 & 1 \\\\ d_{01}^2 & 0 & d_{12}^2 & \\\\cdots & d_{1n}^2 & 1 \\\\ d_{02}^2 & d_{12}^2 & 0 & \\\\cdots & d_{2n}^2 & 1 \\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\ d_{0n}^2 & d_{1n}^2 & d_{2n}^2 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \\\\cdots & 1 & 0 \\\\end{vmatrix} If A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n \\\\in {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^k}, then they make up the vertices of an (possibly degenerate) n-simplex {\\\\displaystyle v_{n}} in \\\\mathbb{R}^k. It can be shown that the n-dimensional volume of the simplex {\\\\displaystyle v_{n}} satisfies Vol_n(v_n)^2 = \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n!)^2 2^n} CM(A_0, \\\\cdots, A_n). Note that, for the case of n=0, we have Vol_0(v_0) = 1, meaning the \\"0-dimensional volume\\" of a 0-simplex is 1, that is, there is 1 point in a 0-simplex. A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n are affinely independent iff Vol_n(v_n) > 0, that is, (-1)^{n+1} CM(A_0, \\\\cdots, A_n) > 0. Thus Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinants give a computational way to prove affine independence. If k < n, then the points must be affinely dependent, thus CM(A_0, \\\\cdots, A_n) = 0. Cayley's 1841 paper studied the special case of k = 3, n = 4, that is, any 5 points A_0, \\\\cdots, A_5 in 3-dimensional space must have CM(A_0, \\\\cdots, A_4) = 0.  History  The first result in distance geometry is Heron's formula, from 1st century AD, which gives the area of a triangle from the distances between its 3 vertices. Brahmagupta's formula, from 7th century AD, generalizes it to cyclic quadrilaterals. Tartaglia, from 16th century AD, generalized it to give the volume of tetrahedron from the distances between its 4 vertices. The modern theory of distance geometry began with Authur Cayley and Karl Menger. Cayley published the Cayley determinant in 1841, which is a special case of the general Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinant. Menger proved in 1928 a characterization theorem of all semimetric spaces that are isometrically embeddable in the n-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^n. In 1931, Menger used distance relations to give an axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry. Leonard Blumenthal's book gives a general overview for distance geometry at the graduate level, a large part of which is treated in English for the first time when it was published.  Menger characterization theorem  Menger proved the following characterization theorem of semimetric spaces: > A semimetric space (R, d) is isometrically embeddable in the n-dimensional > Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^n, but not in \\\\mathbb{R}^m for any 0 \\\\le m < n, > if and only if: # R contains an (n+1)-point subset S that is isometric with > an affinely independent (n+1)-point subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n; # any > (n+3)-point subset S', obtained by adding any two additional points of R to > S, is congruent to an (n+3)-point subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n. A proof of this theorem in a slightly weakened form (for metric spaces instead of semimetric spaces) is in .  Characterization via Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinants  The following results are proved in Blumethal's book.  Embedding n+1 points in \\\\mathbb{R}^n  Given a semimetric space (S,d) , with S = {P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n}, and d(P_i, P_j) = d_{ij}\\\\ge 0, 0 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n, an isometric embedding of (S, d) into \\\\mathbb{R}^n is defined by A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n \\\\in {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{n}}, such that d(A_i, A_j) = d_{ij} for all 0 \\\\le i < j \\\\le n. Again, one asks whether such an isometric embedding exists for (S,d). A necessary condition is easy to see: for all k = 1, \\\\cdots, n, let v_k be the k-simplex formed by A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_k, then (-1)^{k+1}CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_k) = (-1)^{k+1}CM(A_0, \\\\cdots, A_k) = 2^k (k!)^k Vol_k(v_k)^2 \\\\ge 0 The converse also holds. That is, if for all k = 1, \\\\cdots, n, (-1)^{k+1}CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_k) \\\\ge 0, then such an embedding exists. Further, such embedding is unique up to isometry in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. That is, given any two isometric embeddings defined by A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n, and A'_0, A'_1,\\\\ldots, A'_n, there exists a (not necessarily unique) isometry T : \\\\mathbb {R} ^{n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb {R} ^{n}, such that T(A_k) = A'_k for all k = 0, \\\\cdots, n. Such T is unique if and only if CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n) eq 0, that is, A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_n are affinely independent.  Embedding n+2 and n+3 points  If n+2 points P_0, \\\\cdots, P_{n+1} can be embedded in \\\\mathbb{R}^n as A_0, \\\\cdots, A_{n+1}, then other than the conditions above, an additional necessary condition is that the (n+1)-simplex formed by A_0, A_1,\\\\ldots, A_{n+1}, must have no (n+1)-dimensional volume. That is, CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+1}) = 0. The converse also holds. That is, if for all k = 1, \\\\cdots, n, (-1)^{k+1}CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_k) \\\\ge 0, and CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+1}) = 0, then such an embedding exists. For embedding n+3 points in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, the necessary and sufficient conditions are similar: # For all k = 1, \\\\cdots, n, (-1)^{k+1}CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_k) \\\\ge 0; #CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+1}) = 0; # CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+2}) = 0; #CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+1}, P_{n+2}) = 0.  Embedding arbitrarily many points  The n+3 case turns out to be sufficient in general. In general, given a semimetric space (R, d), it can be isometrically embedded in \\\\mathbb{R}^n if and only if there exists P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n\\\\in R, such that, for all k = 1, \\\\cdots, n, (-1)^{k+1}CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_k) \\\\ge 0, and for any P_{n+1}, P_{n+2} \\\\in R, #CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+1}) = 0; #CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+2}) = 0; #CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n, P_{n+1}, P_{n+2}) = 0. And such embedding is unique up to isometry in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Further, if CM(P_0, \\\\cdots, P_n) eq 0, then it cannot be isometrically embedded in any \\\\mathbb{R}^m, m < n. And such embedding is unique up to unique isometry in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Thus, Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinants give a concrete way to calculate whether a semimetric space can be embedded in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, for some finite n, and if so, what is the minimal n. Applications There are many applications of distance geometry. In telecommunication networks such as GPS, the positions of some sensors are known (which are called anchors) and some of the distances between sensors are also known: the problem is to identify the positions for all sensors. Hyperbolic navigation is one pre-GPS technology that uses distance geometry for locating ships based on the time it takes for signals to reach anchors. There are many applications in chemistry. Techniques such as NMR can measure distances between pairs of atoms of a given molecule, and the problem is to infer the 3-dimensional shape of the molecule from those distances. Some software packages for applications are: *DGSOL. Solves large distance geometry problems in macromolecular modeling. *Xplor-NIH. Based on X-PLOR, to determine the structure of molecules based on data from NMR experiments. It solves distance geometry problems with heuristic methods (such as Simulated Annealing) and local search methods (such as Conjugate Gradient Minimization). *TINKER. Molecular modeling and design. It can solve distance geometry problems. *SNLSDPclique. MATLAB code for locating sensors in a sensor network based on the distances between the sensors.

Tarleton was eventually ranked as a general years after his service in the colonies during the American Revolutionary War, and afterwards did not lead troops into battle. Tarleton's cavalrymen were called 'Tarleton's Raiders'. His green uniform was the standard uniform of the British Legion, a provincial unit organised in New York, in 1778. After returning to Great Britain in 1781 at the age of 27, Tarleton was elected a Member of Parliament for Liverpool and returned to office in the early 19th century. As such, Tarleton became a prominent Whig politician despite his young man's reputation as a rou√©. Given the importance of the slave trade to the British shipping industry in Liverpool, Tarleton strongly supported slavery as an economic means.  Early life  Banastre Tarleton was the third of seven children born to the merchant John Tarleton (1718‚Äì1773), who served as Mayor of Liverpool in 1764 and had extensive trading links with Britain's American colonies.Scotti p. 14 His paternal grandfather Thomas Tarleton had been a shipowner and slave trader. Banastre's younger brother John (1755‚Äì1841) entered the family business. He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP). Tarleton was educated at the Middle Temple, London and went to University College, Oxford, in 1771, preparing for a career as a lawyer. In 1773 at the age of 19, he inherited ¬£5,000 on his father's death. He squandered almost all of it in less than a year on gambling and women, mostly at the Cocoa Tree club in London. In 1775 purchased a commission as a cavalry officer (Cornet) in the 1st Dragoon Guards (effective from 2 May 1775), where he proved to be a gifted horseman and leader of troops. Owing to his abilities, he worked his way up through the ranks to Lieutenant Colonel without having to purchase any further commissions.  American Revolutionary War  In December 1775, at the age of 21, the volunteer-soldier Banastre Tarleton sailed from Cork to North America, where the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì83) had broken out. Tarleton sailed with Lord Cornwallis as part of an expedition to capture the southern city of Charleston, South Carolina.Wilson p. 243 After that expedition failed, at the Battle of Sullivan's Island (28 June 1776), Tarleton joined the main British Army under command of General William Howe, in New York City. Under the command of Colonel William Harcourt, Tarleton, as a cornet (lieutenant), was part of a scouting party sent to gather intelligence on the movements of General Charles Lee, in New Jersey. On 13 December 1776, Tarleton surrounded a house in Basking Ridge, and forced Gen. Lee, still in dressing gown, to surrender, by threatening to burn down the house; the prisoner of war, General Lee, was taken to New York, and later was used in an exchange of prisoners. In the course of the colonial war in North America, Cornet Tarleton's campaign service during 1776 earned him the position of brigade major at the end of the year; he was twenty-two years old. He was promoted to captain on 13 June 1778. Major Tarleton was at the Battle of Brandywine and at other battles in the campaigns of 1777 and 1778. One such battle, in 1778, was an attack upon a communications outpost in Easttown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, which was guarded by troops commanded by Capt. Henry Lee III, of the Continental Army, who repulsed the British attack, and in which Major Tarleton was wounded.  Capture of Charleston  After becoming commander of the British Legion, a force of American Loyalist cavalry and light infantry, also called Tarleton's Raiders, Tarleton went to South Carolina, at the beginning of 1780. There, Tarleton's Raiders supported Sir Henry Clinton in the siege operations that culminated in the capture of Charleston. The siege and capture of the city were part of the British strategy in the southern military theatre meant to restore royal authority over the southern colonies of British North America. After Tarleton's first major victory at Monck's Corner, during the Siege of Charleston, a soldier of the British Legion was involved in an attempted sexual assault that entered legend. The attack by one of Tarleton's soldiers against a civilian woman in the area was halted by one of his companions.  Battle of Waxhaws  Battle of Waxhaw Creek (29 May 1780), in Lancaster County, South Carolina On 29 May 1780, Colonel Tarleton, with a force of 149 mounted soldiers, overtook a detachment of 350 to 380 Virginia Continentals, led by Colonel Abraham Buford, who refused to surrender or to stop his march. Only after sustaining many casualties did Buford order the American soldiers to surrender. Nonetheless, Tarleton's forces ignored the white flag and massacred the soldiers of Buford's detachment; 113 American soldiers were killed, 203 were captured, and 150 were severely-wounded. The British army casualties were 5 soldiers killed and 12 soldiers wounded.Boatner, Cassell's Biographical Dictionary, p. 1174 From the perspective of the British Army, the affair of the massacre is known as the Battle of Waxhaw Creek. In that time, the American rebels used the phrase 'Tarleton's quarter' (shooting after surrender) as meaning 'no quarter offered'. In the 19th century, American historians represented Tarleton as a ruthless butcher, whilst the perspective of some contemporary historians has changed in this regard. An eye-witness, the American field surgeon Robert Brownfield, wrote that Colonel Buford raised the white flag of surrender to the British Legion, \\"expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare\\"; yet, while Buford called for quarter, Colonel Tarleton's horse was shot with a musket ball, felling horse and man. On seeing that, the Loyalist cavalrymen believed that the Virginia Continentals had shot their commander ‚Äì while they asked him for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops attacked the Virginians with an \\"indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages\\"; in the aftermath, the British Legion soldiers killed wounded American soldiers where they lay. Colonel Tarleton's account, published in 1787, said that his horse had been shot from under him, and that his soldiers, thinking him dead, engaged in \\"a vindictive asperity not easily restrained\\".Banastre Tarleton, A History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781, in the Southern Provinces of North America, London and Dublin, 1787, p 32. On the other hand, Tarleton advocated repression, and criticized the mildness of Lord Cornwallis's methods, because moderation \\"did not reconcile enemies, but . . . discourages friends\\". Regardless of the extent to which they were true or false, the reports of British atrocities motivated Whig-leaning colonials to support the American Revolution. In the event, on 7 October 1780, at the Battle of Kings Mountain, South Carolina, soldiers of the Continental Army, having heard of the slaughter at Waxhaw Creek, killed surrendering American Loyalists, after a sniper killed their British commanding officer, Maj. Patrick Ferguson.Steel Wills (2014), pp. 7-8  Subsequent operations  In South Carolina, Col. Tarleton's British Legion were harried by Francis Marion, 'The Swamp Fox', an American militia commander who practiced guerrilla warfare against the British. Throughout the campaigns, Tarleton was unable to capture him or thwart his operations. Marion's local popularity among anti-British South Carolinians ensured continual aid and comfort for the American cause. In contrast, Colonel Tarleton alienated the colonial citizens with arbitrary confiscations of cattle and food stocks. Tarleton materially helped Cornwallis to win the Battle of Camden in August 1780. On 22 August, he was promoted to major in the 79th Regiment of Foot (Royal Liverpool Volunteers). He defeated Thomas Sumter at Fishing Creek, aka \\"Catawba Fords\\", but was less successful when he encountered the same general at Blackstock's Farm in November 1780. On 17 January 1781 Tarleton's forces were virtually destroyed by American Brigadier General Daniel Morgan at the Battle of Cowpens. Tarleton and about 200 men escaped the battlefield.\\"70th Congress, 1st Session House Document No. 328: Historical Statements Concerning the Battle of King's Mountain and the Battle of the Cowpens,\\" page 53. Washington: United States Government Printing Office (1928). Retrieved on 10 December 2007. William Washington commanded the rebel cavalry; he was attacked by the British commander and two of his men. Tarleton was stopped by Washington himself, who attacked him with his sword, calling out, \\"Where is now the boasting Tarleton?\\" A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington's orderly trumpeter. Washington survived this assault and in the process wounded Tarleton's right hand with a sabre blow, while Tarleton creased Washington's knee with a pistol shot that also wounded his horse. Washington pursued Tarleton for sixteen miles, but gave up the chase when he came to the plantation of Adam Goudylock near Thicketty Creek. Retreating from his defeat at the Battle of Cowpens, Tarleton was able to escape capture by forcing a local plantation owner, Adam Goudylock, to serve as a guide.Hays, Joel Stanford, \\"Adam Goudylock (ca. 1726‚Äì1796), Planter, of Albemarle County, Virginia, and Union County, South Carolina,\\" The American Genealogist 88, no. 1 & 2 (2016): pp. 49-56, 107-117, at 53-54. Tarleton's Movements historical marker in Adams Grove, Virginia He was successful in a skirmish at Torrence's Tavern while the British crossed the Catawba River (Cowan's Ford Skirmish 1 February 1781) and took part in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781. With his men, Tarleton marched with Cornwallis into Virginia. There he carried out a series of small expeditions while in Virginia. Among them was a raid on Charlottesville, where the state government had relocated following the British occupation of the capital at Richmond. He was trying to capture Governor Thomas Jefferson and members of the Virginia legislature. The raid was partially foiled by the ride of Jack Jouett, with Jefferson and all but seven of the legislators escaping over the mountains. Tarleton destroyed arms and munitions and succeeded in dispersing the Assembly. Tarleton was brevetted to lieutenant-colonel in the 79th Foot on 26 June 1781. In July 1781 some of his forces allegedly were involved in Francisco's Fight, an alleged skirmish between colonial Peter Francisco and nine of Tarleton's dragoons, which resulted in one dead, eight wounded and Francisco capturing eight horses. (Link for 1845 edition) After other missions, Cornwallis instructed Tarleton to hold Gloucester Point, during the Siege of Yorktown. On 4 October 1781, the French Lauzun's Legion and the British cavalry, commanded by Tarleton, skirmished at Gloucester Point. Tarleton was unhorsed, and Lauzun's Legion drove the British within their lines, before being ordered to withdraw by the Marquis de Choisy. The Legion suffered three Hussars killed, and two officers and eleven Hussars wounded.Massoni G√©rard-Antoine, Histoire d'un r√©giment de cavalerie l√©g√®re, le 5e hussards de 1783 √† 1815, Paris, Editions Archives & Cultures, 2007, p. 73 p. Fifty British were killed or wounded, including Tarleton.Historical Society of Pennsylvania, \\"Extracts from the Journal of Lieutenant John Bell Tilden\\", The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, p. 60 The British surrendered Gloucester Point to the French and Americans after the surrender at Yorktown, Virginia in October 1781. After the surrender, the senior British officers were invited to dinner by their American captors, and the only one not to get an invitation was Tarleton. He returned to Britain on parole, finished with this war at the age of 27.  Post-war years  Tarleton had lost two fingers from a musket ball received in his right hand during the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in North Carolina, but \\"his crippled hand was to prove an electoral asset\\" back home. The condition of his hand is disguised in the pose of his 1782 portrait (shown in this article) by Sir Joshua Reynolds. After his return to Great Britain, Tarleton wrote a history of his experience in the war in North America, entitled Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America (London, 1781). He portrayed his own actions in the Carolinas favourably and questioned decisions made by Cornwallis. It was criticized by Lieutenant Roderick Mackenzie in his Strictures on Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton's History (1781) and in the Cornwallis Correspondence.  Politics  In 1784, Tarleton stood for election as M.P. for Liverpool, but was narrowly defeated. In 1790 he succeeded Richard Pennant as MP for Liverpool in the Parliament of Great Britain and, with the exception of a single year, was re-elected to the House of Commons until 1812. He was a supporter of Charles James Fox despite their opposing views on the British role in the American War of Independence. Tarleton spoke on military matters and a variety of other subjects. He is especially noted for supporting the slave trade, which was highly important to the port of Liverpool as one of the UK's most prominent port cities at the time and still to date. Tarleton was working to preserve the slavery business with his brothers Clayton and Thomas, and he became well known for his taunting and mockery of the abolitionists. He generally voted with the Parliamentary opposition. When the Fox-North Coalition came to power, he supported the government nominally headed by William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.He was rewarded with the title of Governor of Berwick and Holy Island. Though he never again led troops into battle, Tarleton continued to be promoted in the army. He was promoted to colonel on 22 November 1790, to Major-General on 4 October 1794 and to Lieutenant-General on 1 January 1801. Tarleton was appointed Colonel of the 21st Light Dragoons on 24 July 1802. He was brevetted to General on 1 January 1812. He had hoped to be appointed to command British forces in the Peninsular War, but the position was instead given to Wellington. He held a military command in Ireland and another in England. In 1815, he was made a baronet and in 1820 a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).  Personal life  Mary Robinson by Thomas Gainsborough, 1781 For 15 years, he had a relationship with the actress and writer Mary Robinson (Perdita), whom he initially seduced on a bet. She was an ex-mistress of the future King George IV while he was still Prince of Wales. Tarleton and Robinson had no children; in 1783 Robinson had a miscarriage. She was important to his parliamentary career, writing many of his speeches. His portrait was painted by both Joshua Reynolds, who showed him at battle in the American Revolution, and Thomas Gainsborough. Tarleton ultimately married Susan Bertie, the young, illegitimate and wealthy daughter of the 4th Duke of Ancaster in 1798. They had no children. Tarleton did however, father an illegitimate daughter in 1797, prior to his marriage. The child was named Banina Georgina (1797‚Äì1818), her mother being named simply as Kolina.Old Church in Saint Pancras Tarleton died in January 1833, at Leintwardine, Herefordshire.

General Tarleton features in person in the 8th book of the series Company of Spears  Captured American battle flags sold at auction  In November 2005, it was announced that four rare battle flags or regimental colours seized in 1779 and 1780 from American soldiers by Tarleton and still held in Britain, would be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York City in 2006.http://www.shareholder.com/bid/downloads/news/20051111-179534.pdf Two of these colours were the Guidon of the 2nd Continental Light Dragoons, captured in 1779; and a \\"beaver\\" standard ‚Äì possibly a Gostelowe List Standard No. 7 dating from 1778. The \\"Beaver\\" Standard and two other flags (possibly division colours) were apparently captured at the Waxhaw Massacre. The flags were sold at auction on Flag Day in the United States (14 June 2006).  Tarleton helmet  Tarleton introduced to the British Legion, and wore himself, a leather helmet with antique style applications and a fur plume (woollen for lower ranks) protruding far into the upper front side. It is depicted in Sir Joshua Reynolds' portrait of Tarleton above and was named after the officer. The helmet was used by British horse artillery troops until the end of the Napoleonic Wars. It was based on Continental European designs that became popular in several other armies before it fell out of fashion. One such design, the Raupenhelm (caterpillar helmet) became the standard-issue headgear of various units in the Bavarian Army until abolished and substituted by the German Reichs typical Pickelhaube after Ludwig II of Bavaria's death in 1886.

It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti√°n Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The town was founded on October 18, 1733 and named after Don Luis de A√±asco, a colonist from the Extremadura region of Spain who came to Puerto Rico with Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. A√±asco was founded by the initiative of rich landowner Don Jos√© de Santiago, who wanted to establish the villa in properties owned by Don Luis de A√±asco. The property was located on the margins of the r√≠o Guaorabo, as the Ta√≠nos called it. A√±asco town was preceded by the first settlement of San Germ√°n. In November 1511, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n handed over governorship to Juan Cer√≥n, a lieutenant of the viceroy Diego Colon (son of Cristobal Colon or Cristopher Columbus). Cer√≥n ordered Miguel de Toro, a lieutenant of Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, to create a \\"Christian Village\\" in western Borinquen, calling it San Germ√°n. This was the second attempt of foundation given in 1511 at the mouth of the Guaorabo River (present day Rio A√±asco), near the area known today as A√±asco, Puerto Rico. This first settlement was attacked in 1528, 1538, and again in 1554. A fort to protect this town began in 1540, but its construction was suspended in 1546 when the people decided to move inland being tired of attacks. Attacks by Carib Indians forced the population to move south inland to the present site of the present town of San Germ√°n. In the 18th century, A√±asco was the fourth most populous municipality in Puerto Rico, after San Germ√°n, San Juan, and others. The A√±asco River is also claimed to be the site of the popular legend of the drowning of the Spaniard Diego Salcedo in 1511 at the hands of the Ta√≠nos, proving the Spanish soldiers were not gods and igniting a revolt. It is believed that the revolt was led by the cacique Chayo√°n and suppressed by Spanish soldiers. Many of the first settlers to the area came from the Canary Islands and the south of Spain. The 1918 San Ferm√≠n earthquake destroyed A√±asco's parish church, the town hall and other buildings, almost eliminating most of the historic downtown structures. Hurricane Maria Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in A√±asco. In some areas of A√±asco there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall. Geography A√±asco is located in the Coastal Plains of the west, bordered by the R√≠o Grande de A√±asco. It is bordered in the north by Rinc√≥n, Aguada, and Moca; Mayag√ºez to the south; and San Sebasti√°n and Las Mar√≠as to the east. The Mona Passage lies to the west of the town. The A√±asco terrain is mostly plain, but features a series of hills and mountains like Canta Gallo (1,194 feet, or 364 meters), Gordo and Pich√≥n (both at 1,115 feet, or 340 meters).Cerro Canta Gallo, Puerto Rico on Lat-Long It is also crossed by several rivers like Icaco River, Caguabo River, La Balsa, and others.Municipios: A√±asco on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico Barrios Subdivisions of A√±asco.

The Andalusian and Canarian Spaniards also influenced much of the Puerto Rican culture which explains the Southern Spanish dialect, and the Spanish colonial architecture. This area of the Island has an array of cultures that include the Basque, French, Corsican and Italian is highly predominant due to the introduction of coffee in this region of the Island.

Arroyo is spread over 5 barrios and Arroyo barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the Guayama Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The town of Arroyo was officially founded on December 25, 1855. However, it is believed that there were previous settlements on the area even previous to the Spanish colonization. It is believed that the name of Arroyo (which means \\"creek\\" in English) is derived from a small water stream where travelers stopped to freshen up before continuing on their way. It has been said that the town came to be formed when a small group of people from the neighbor town of Guayama came to the region looking for a port to export and import merchandise. Still, a local newspaper called La Gaceta de Puerto Rico published in 1868 that Arroyo was founded in 1852. Between 1859 and 1860, City Hall signed agreements to open streets and build a town square and a sewer system for the town. In 1858, Samuel Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico, then a Spanish Colony. Morse's oldest daughter Susan Walker Morse (1821‚Äì1885), would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of Guayama. During one of her visits she met and later married Edward Lind, a Danish merchant who worked in the Hacienda La Henriqueta in Arroyo. Lind purchased the Hacienda from his sister when she became a widow. Morse, who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son-in-law, set a two-mile telegraph line connecting his son-in-law's Hacienda to their house in Arroyo. The line was inaugurated on March 1, 1859 in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags. The first lines transmitted by Samuel Morse that day in Puerto Rico were: > \\"Puerto Rico, beautiful jewel! When you are linked with the other jewels of > the Antilles in the necklace of the world's telegraph, yours will not shine > less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen!\\" When after the Treaty of Paris (1898), the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Arroyo was 4,867. In 1902, Puerto Rico's Legislative Assembly approved a law to consolidate certain municipalities. According to it, Arroyo would be merged with Guayama starting on July 1 of that year. However, the law was revoked in 1905 returning Arroyo to its municipal status. In early 1999, the U.S. Congressional record documented a commendation of Arroyo, on its 100-year relationship with the U.S., noting that many citizens of Arroyo have fought and died in wars for the U.S., such as Virgilio S√°nchez and Raul Serrano. Geography Arroyo belongs to the alluvial plains sub-region of Ponce-Patillas known as the Southern Coastal Valley. The area is very dry although its plains are productive thanks to artificial irrigation.

Barceloneta is spread over 3 barrios and Barceloneta Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Barceloneta was founded on July 1, 1881 by Don Bonocio Llenza Feli√∫, an immigrant from Barcelona, Spain. The name of Barceloneta (\\"Little Barcelona\\") is derived from the Spanish city. Barceloneta was one of the last municipalities created by the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. Homes in the countryside of Barceloneta in the early 20th century About a decade after its foundation, the town had a significant economic development led by agriculture and industry. By 1894, there were three sugarcane estates, 93 sugar mills, and the production of other fruits.Barceloneta, Puerto Rico on BoricuaOnline In 1899, Barceloneta requested to be annexed to the town of Manat√≠. An election was scheduled for August 14, 1899 to decide the matter. However, on August 8, the island suffered the effects of Hurricane San Ciriaco, which prevented the elections from being held. The following year, Governor George Whitefield Davis ordered the annexation of Barceloneta into Manat√≠. The annexation was short-lived. Eleven years later, the government reinstated Barceloneta as a municipality.Barceloneta, municipio de Puerto Rico on PRfogui After Central Plazuela, a large sugar cane mill, closed in 1963, Barceloneta started reinforcing its agricultural economy with pineapples and other minor fruits.

Because of its location next to the R√≠o Grande de Manat√≠, Barceloneta was known for many years as a site of important port activity, for shipment of sugar and salt, as well as passengers to New York City and Barcelona. Don Bonocio's son was the owner of a sail ship that made those routes. Geography The Municipality of Barceloneta sits on the northern karst region of Puerto Rico, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.

Cidra is spread over 12 barrios and Cidra Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. Cidra is known as \\"El Pueblo de la Eterna Primavera\\" (\\"The Town of Eternal Spring\\") and \\"El Pueblo de la Paloma Sabanera\\".  History  The region of what is now Cidra belonged to the Ta√≠no region of Cubuy, which covered a portion of the center of Puerto Rico, tobarrios the East coast. The region was led by cacique Caguax. There are not many records that show that the region was populated after the Spanish colonization. However, it is believed that around 1795, a Catalan named Frujols built a hermitage or shrine around which a small village settled. The settlement became a ward of Cayey, until 1807 when the residents gave the power to Victoriano de Rivera to ask the Governor for permission to found an independent town. In 1809, a landowner known as Bibiana V√°zquez donated the land needed for the foundation, and Governor Salvador Mel√©ndez approved the petition. Victoriano de Rivera was appointed to lead the town, but he was quickly replaced by Wenceslao V√°zquez due to illness. At the time of its foundation, Cidra had 26 houses and 11 huts. It is believed that its name is derived from the citron fruit which was widely cultivated in the region. During the years following its foundation, a church and city hall were built. By 1822, there were already two public schools in town. Two years later, a road communicating the town with Caguas was opened. In 1868, the population of Cidra was more than 5,000 residents, which included European immigrants and slaves. The United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the US conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Cidra was 7,552. In 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law for the consolidation of certain municipalities. As a result, Cidra was again incorporated to the town of Cayey. However, in 1905 a new law revoked the previous one, turning Cidra into an independent municipality again. Hurricane Maria Much of Cidra suffered landslides Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Cidra with the significant amount of rainfall. Some areas of Cidra experienced more than 25 landslides per kilometer. Citizens, with machetes in hand, worked to clear the roadways of debri after the hurricane hit, especially in Rabanal, Arena and Ceiba, barrios of Cidra located at high altitudes. 1500 homes were left without a roof and many would never receive funds for repairs. One local (analog) radio antenna survived the catastrophe allowing for some communication within the town to take place. Before the hurricane there had been plans to eliminate the radio tower, but when 92.7% of Puerto Rico's towers were destroyed by the hurricane, plans to eliminate the analog radio tower were scrapped. Puerto Rico Highway 172, the main highway into Cidra from the Metropolitican area had to remain closed for repairs for five months. It was not until six months after the hurricane struck that power was restored to Cidra. Geography Paloma sabanera Cidra is located at the top of a hill in the eastern part of the Cordillera Central.

Symbols Flag Consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, yellow the top, green the middle and blue the bottom, and in some instances the middle stripe could have embroidered or printed the Coat Of Arms. The flag is very similar to the provincial flag of Islas del Car√≥ (I.D.C.) of neighbour country of El Conquistador except that the yellow stripe is half the size as the green and blue stripes much like the flag of Colombia except that the red stripe is replaced by the green one at the bottom. It is unknown whether the flag was made to coincide with the densely populated province of El Conquistador or was created by natural and neutral causes. Coat of arms On a gold background three Corozo Palms, with clusters in their original color, planted on a green landscape and in front of a mountain range. At the bottom, blue and silver water waves sprinkled with gold nuggets. The three towercrown is gold with black stones. It also has another flag the colors are red and white the white star and the blue outline. The Corozo Palms represent the name of the town and its river, whose margins were populated with this palms. The mountains represent the high and striking Mountains of Corozal. The waves represent the Corozal River and gold nuggets, metal that until recently was panned in its rivera. The gold background represents the hard labor and alludes to the gold of Corozal, so appreciated long ago for its purity. The crown is an emblem used to designate the cities and towns.

Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly. They exhibit a tendency to show self- discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement; they display planned rather than spontaneous behavior; and they are generally dependable. It is manifested in characteristic behaviors such as being neat, and systematic; also including such elements as carefulness, thoroughness, and deliberation (the tendency to think carefully before acting). Conscientiousness is one of the five traits of both the Five Factor Model and the HEXACO model of personality and is an aspect of what has traditionally been referred to as having character. Conscientious individuals are generally hard-working, and reliable. When taken to an extreme, they may also be \\"workaholics\\", perfectionists, and compulsive in their behavior. People who score low on conscientiousness tend to be laid back, less goal-oriented, and less driven by success; they also are more likely to engage in antisocial and criminal behavior.  Personality models  Conscientiousness is one of the five major dimensions in the Big Five model (also called Five Factor Model) of personality, which also consists of extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, and agreeableness (OCEAN acronym). Two of many personality tests that assess these traits are Costa and McCrae's NEO PI-RCosta, P. T. & McCrae, R. R. (1992). NEO personality Inventory professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources. and Goldberg's NEO-IPIP. According to these models, conscientiousness is considered to be a continuous dimension of personality, rather than a categorical 'type' of person. In the NEO framework, Conscientiousness is seen as having six facets: Competence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline, and Deliberation. Other models suggest a smaller set of two \\"aspects\\": orderliness and industriousness form an intermediate level of organization, with orderliness associated with the desire to keep things organized and tidy and industriousness being more associated with productivity and work ethic. Other personality traits ((Low) extraversion, (high) agreeableness, (low) openness and (low) neuroticism) are linked to high conscientiousness along with impulse control. Behaviorally, low conscientiousness is associated with an inability to motivate one's self to perform tasks that the individual desires to accomplish. Conscientiousness also appears in other models of personality, such as Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory, in which it is related to both self-directedness and persistence. It also includes the specific traits of rule consciousness and perfectionism in Cattell's 16 PF model. It is negatively associated with impulsive sensation-seeking in Zuckerman's alternative five model. Traits associated with conscientiousness are frequently assessed by self-report integrity tests given by various corporations to prospective employees.  Origin  Terms such as 'hard-working,' 'reliable,' and 'persevering' describe desirable aspects of character. Because it was once believed to be a moral evaluation, conscientiousness was overlooked as a real psychological attribute. The reality of individual differences in conscientiousness has now been clearly established by studies of cross-observer agreement. Peer and expert ratings confirm the self-reports that people make about their degrees of conscientiousness. Furthermore, both self-reports and observer ratings of conscientiousness predict real-life outcomes such as academic success. During most of the 20th century, psychologists believed that personality traits could be divided into two categories: temperament and character. Temperament traits were thought to be biologically based, whereas character traits were thought to be learned either during childhood or throughout life. With the advent of the FFM (Five-Factor Model), behavior geneticists began systematic studies of the full range of personality traits, and it soon became clear that all five factors are substantially heritable. Identical twins showed very similar personality traits even when they had been separated at birth and raised apart, and this was equally true for both character traits and temperament traits. Parents and communities influence the ways in which conscientiousness is expressed, but they apparently do not influence its level.McCrae, Robert. (2004). \\"Conscientiousness\\" Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology, Three-Volume Set. Academic Press. p. 470  Measurement  A person's level of conscientiousness is generally assessed using self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self-report measures are either lexical or based on statements. Deciding which measure of either type to use in research is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the study being undertaken.  Lexical  Lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect conscientiousness traits, such as efficient and systematic, and are very space and time efficient for research purposes. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure as part of his 100-word Big Five markers. Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. Thompson (2008) systematically revised these measures to develop the International English Mini-Markers which has superior validity and reliability in populations both within and outside North America. Internal consistency reliability of the International English Mini-Markers for the Conscientiousness measure for native English-speakers is reported as .90, that for non-native English- speakers is .86.  Statement  Statement measures tend to comprise more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, often forget to put things back in their proper place, or are careful to avoid making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.  Behavior   Development  Currently, little is known about conscientiousness in young children because the self-report inventories typically used to assess it are not appropriate for that age group. It is likely, however, that there are individual differences on this factor at an early age. It is known, for example, that some children have attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD may not go away with age; however it is still unclear how neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism relate to the development of conscientiousness and other personality traits), which is characterized in part by problems with concentration, organization, and persistence; traits which are related to conscientiousness . Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies suggest that conscientiousness is relatively low among adolescents but increases between 18 and 30 years of age. Research has also shown that conscientiousness generally increases with age from 21 to 60, though the rate of increase does slow.http://70-40-202-166.bluehost.com/drjwilcoxson/wp- content/uploads/2008/08/personality-article.pdf Individual differences are also strongly preserved, meaning that a careful, neat, and scrupulous 30-year- old is likely to become a careful, neat, and scrupulous 80-year-old.  Daily life  People who score high on the trait of conscientiousness tend to be more organized and less cluttered in their homes and offices. For example, their books tend to be neatly shelved in alphabetical order, or categorized by topic, rather than scattered around the room. Their clothes tend to be folded and arranged in drawers or closets instead of lying on the floor. The presence of planners and to-do lists are also signs of conscientiousness. Their homes tend to have better lighting than the homes of people who score low on this trait.Gosling, S. (2008). Snoop: What your stuff says about you?. New York: Basic Books. Recently, ten behaviors strongly associated with conscientiousness were scientifically categorized (the number at the end of each behavior is a correlation coefficient; a negative number means conscientious people were less likely to manifest the behavior):  Academic and workplace performance  Conscientiousness is importantly related to successful academic performance in students and workplace performance among managers and workers. Low levels of conscientiousness are strongly associated with procrastination. A considerable amount of research indicates that conscientiousness has a moderate to large positive correlation with performance in the workplace, and indeed that after general mental ability is taken into account, the other four of the Big Five personality traits do not aid in predicting career success. Conscientious employees are generally more reliable, more motivated, and harder working. They also have lower rates of absenteeism and counterproductive work behaviors such as stealing and fighting with other employees. Furthermore, conscientiousness is the only personality trait that correlates with performance across all categories of jobs. However, agreeableness and emotional stability may also be important, particularly in jobs that involve a significant amount of social interaction. Of all manager/leader types, top executives show the lowest level of rule-following, a conscientious trait. Conscientiousness is not always positively related to job performance, sometimes the opposite is true. Being too conscientious could lead to taking too much time to making urgent decisions and to working too attached to the rules and lack innovation.  Subjective well-being  In general, conscientiousness has a positive relationship with subjective well- being, particularly satisfaction with life, so highly conscientious people tend to be happier with their lives than those who score low on this trait. Although conscientiousness is generally seen as a positive trait to possess, recent research has suggested that in some situations it may be harmful for well-being. In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered more than twice as much if they became unemployed.Boyce, C. J., & Wood, A., M., & Brown, G. D. A. (in press). The dark side of conscientiousness: Conscientious people experience greater drops in life satisfaction following unemployment. Journal of Research in Personality The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. This finding is consistent with perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.Wood, A. M., & Tarrier, N. (in press). Positive Clinical Psychology: A new vision and strategy for integrated research and practice. Clinical Psychology Review  Problematic life outcomes  Low conscientiousness has been linked to antisocial and criminal behaviors, as well as unemployment, homelessness, and imprisonment. Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness taken together are also associated with substance abuse. People low in conscientiousness have difficulty saving money and have different borrowing practices than conscientious people. High conscientiousness is associated with more careful planning of shopping trips and less impulse buying of unneeded items. Conscientiousness has been found to be positively correlated with business and white-collar crime.  Health and longevity  According to an 80-year old and ongoing study started in 1921 by psychologist Lewis Terman on over 1,500 gifted adolescent Californians, \\"The strongest predictor of long life was conscientiousness.\\" Specific behaviors associated with low conscientiousness may explain its influence on longevity. Nine different behaviors that are among the leading causes of mortality‚Äîalcohol use, disordered eating (including obesity), drug use, lack of exercise, risky sexual behavior, risky driving, tobacco use, suicide, and violence‚Äîare all predicted by low conscientiousness. Health behaviors are more strongly correlated with the conventionality rather than the impulse-control aspect of conscientiousness. Apparently, social norms influence many health- relevant behavior, such as healthy diet and exercise, not smoking and moderate drinking, and highly conscientious people adhere the most strongly to these norms. Additionally, conscientiousness is positively related to health behaviors such as regular visits to a doctor, checking smoke alarms, and adherence to medication regimens. Such behavior may better safeguard health and prevent disease.  Relationships  Relationship quality is positively associated with partners' level of conscientiousness, and highly conscientious people are less likely to get divorced. Conscientiousness is associated with lower rates of behavior associated with divorce, such as extramarital affairs, spousal abuse, and alcohol abuse. Conscientious behaviors may have a direct influence on relationship quality, as people low in conscientiousness are less responsible, less responsive to their partners, are more condescending, and less likely to hold back offensive comments. On the other hand, more conscientious people are better at managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, perhaps because they elicit less criticism due to their well- controlled and responsible behavior.  Intelligence  Conscientiousness significantly correlated negatively with abstract reasoning (‚àí0.26) and verbal reasoning (‚àí0.23). Large unselected studies, however, have found null relationships,Luciano, M., Wainwright, M. A., Wright, M. J., & Martin, N. G. (2006). The heritability of conscientiousness facets and their relationship to IQ and academic achievement. Personality and Individual Differences, 40, 1189‚Äì1199. and the negative relationship sometimes found in selected samples such as universities may result from students whose low ability would reduce their chance of gaining entrance, but who have higher conscientiousness, gaining their GPA via hard work rather than giftedness. A large study found that fluid intelligence was significantly negatively correlated with the order (‚àí0.15), self-discipline (‚àí0.08), and deliberation (‚àí0.09) subfactors of conscientiousness (all correlations significant with p < 0.001.).  Political attitudes and obedience to authority  Conscientiousness has a weak relationship with conservative political attitudes. Although right-wing authoritarianism is one of the most powerful predictors of prejudice, a large scale meta-analysis found that conscientiousness itself is uncorrelated with general prejudice. Rebellion against control is significantly negatively correlated with conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is associated with rule compliance, obedience and integrity.  Creativity  The orderliness/dependability subfactors (order, dutifulness, and deliberation) of conscientiousness correlate negatively with creativity while the industriousness/achievement subfactors correlate positively. Another study showed that people who score high on the order subfactor of conscientiousness show less innovative behavior. Group conscientiousness has a negative effect on group performance during creative tasks. Groups with only conscientious members have difficulty solving open-ended problems.  Adaptability  A study from 2006 found that those scoring low on conscientiousness make better decisions after unanticipated changes in the context of a task. Specifically, the subfactors order, dutifulness, and deliberation negatively correlated with decision-making quality, but not competence, achievement striving, and self- discipline.  Religiosity  General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits .  Societal Health  Research comparing countries on personality traits has largely found that countries with high average levels of conscientiousness tend to be poorer, less democratic, and to have lower life expectancy compared to their less conscientious counterparts. Less conscientious nations had higher rates of atheism and of alcohol consumption. As discussed earlier, at the individual level, conscientiousness is associated with valuing security, conformity and tradition. Adherence to such values might be more adaptive under harsh living circumstances than more comfortable and prosperous ones.  Geography   United States  Average levels of conscientiousness vary by state in the United States. People living in the central part, including the states of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Missouri, tend to have higher scores on average than people living in other regions. People in the southwestern states of New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona also have relatively high average scores on conscientiousness. Among the eastern states, Florida is the only one that scores in the top ten for this personality trait. The four states with the lowest scores on conscientiousness on average were, in descending order, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska. Original research article:  Great Britain  A large scale survey of residents of Great Britain found that average levels of all the Big Five, including conscientiousness, vary across regional districts in England, Wales and Scotland. High levels of conscientiousness were found throughout much of Southern England, scattered areas of the Midlands, and most of the Scottish Highlands. Low levels of conscientiousness were observed in London, Wales, and parts of the North of England. Higher mean levels of regional conscientiousness were positively correlated with voting for the Conservative Party, and negatively correlated with voting for the Labour Party, in the 2005 and 2010 elections, and also correlated with a higher proportion of married residents, with higher life expectancy for men and women, fewer long-term health problems, and with lower rates of mortality from stroke, cancer, and heart disease. Higher regional conscientiousness was also correlated with lower median annual income in 2011.

It is part of the Yauco metropolitan statistical area. The town of Gu√°nica, also known as Pueblo de Gu√°nica, is the principal town of the municipality. The town's population in 2000 was 9,247 people among 3,808 housing units over a land area of . The town is located on a deeply indented harbor of the same name. The harbor resembles a tropical fjord, narrow and bordered by rugged hills, barely a quarter-mile wide, but about from mouth to the town. The town is about and over two hours' driving distance from San Juan, the capital city of the island, and about west of Ponce, another principal city of the island. Gu√°nica's postal ZIP Code is 00653 and telephone area codes are 787 and 939. The urban area of Ensenada has a separate postal ZIP Code of 00647. History Settlement American troops landing at Gu√°nica in 1898, by Howard Chandler Christy Juan Ponce de Leon landed in the Gu√°nica harbor on August 12, 1508 and founded a town called Guayn√≠a, a word derived from the Ta√≠no indigenous culture that possibly meant \\"Here is a place with water\\". The town, considered the capital of the island of Puerto Rico (which was at that time named Isla de San Juan Bautista), was destroyed during the indigenous uprising of 1511, and the area was abandoned by Europeans for some years, during which time San Juan (itself at first called Puerto Rico) became the capital of the island. The United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Gu√°nica barrio was 2,700. The refounded town of Gu√°nica was at first a barrio of the municipality of Yauco until Gu√°nica was established as a separate municipality on March 13, 1914. V√≠ctor √Ångel Sallaberry Safini was Gu√°nica's first mayor. Invasion Gloucester landing team On July 25, 1898, American forces (who included the young poet-writer Carl Sandburg led by General Nelson A. Miles) landed in Gu√°nica as part of the course of the Puerto Rican Campaign in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. This invasion led to Puerto Rico being acquired by the United States. The invasion, just one small part of the war between Spain and United States, occurred in Gu√°nica due to its sheltered harbor and proximity to Ponce, besides being such an unexpected site for such an attack, which had been anticipated at the heavily fortified city of San Juan. The Gloucester was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Gu√°nica. Twenty-eight sailors and Marines, under the command of lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. M√©ndez L√≥pez and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M√©ndez L√≥pez and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco. The invasion is commemorated by a contentious monument on the waterfront: along a broad paseo (el malec√≥n), there is a large coral boulder marked by the carved words, \\"3rd Battalion, 1st U.S.V. Engineers, September 16, 1898.\\" July 25 was subsequently commemorated in Puerto Rico as Occupation Day, later renamed Constitution Day (see Public holidays in Puerto Rico). Today Rock in Gu√°nica which indicates where Major General Nelson A. Miles and his men landed Gu√°nica is a modern town that maintains roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as el pueblo de la amistad ('the town of friendship'), it is also occasionally referred to as el pueblo de las doce calles ('the town of the twelve streets'). The central part of town consists of five streets running north‚Äìsouth crossing seven other streets that run east‚Äìwest, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, one of which is the town plaza. Facing the plaza is the Catholic Church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a music stand. In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort Capr√≥n. Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of Central Gu√°nica. The resort chain known as Club Med once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town, but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some of land, including of beach, have been intermittently for sale. It is a fishing village; commercial fishermen still ply their traditional trade beyond the harbor entrance. Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa offers beach access and a short boat ride to Giligan Island, which is a great spot to go snorkeling. The water is crystal clear and shallow, in which old pieces of coral and fish can be seen. People can walk from one island to another. On January 6, 2020, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Gu√°nica and nearby municipalities, and several residences and cars were destroyed. On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit. Geography Guayac√°n Centenario Gu√°nica has mountains and a forest. The Gu√°nica State Forest (Bosque Estatal de Gu√°nica) is also the name of a small dry forest reserve east and west of the town, the largest remaining tract of tropical dry coastal forest in the world, and designated an international Biosphere Reserve in 1981. The park comprising much of the dry forest is known as el Bosque Seco de Gu√°nica. Highway Route 116, the nearest principal road, heads west toward Lajas and east toward Ponce, passing through the island of Puerto Rico's driest area. The largely intact forest of the Gu√°nica Dry Forest reserve hosts the greatest number of bird species found on the island, including several bird species seldom found anywhere else: the Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo, Puerto Rican woodpecker, the Puerto Rican nightjar, and the Puerto Rican emerald hummingbird. Other animals thought to be extinct in Puerto Rico have turned up in this forest. Many different types of cactus grow here, a stunning contrast to the lush Caribbean National Forest in the northeast part of the island, which is a tropical rainforest. The contrast is due to the mountain ridge Cordillera Central which separates Gu√°nica from the northeast part of the island; while the northeast receives over of precipitation each year, Gu√°nica receives less than 30, and some regions of the forest reserve are said to receive only six inches. The forest reserve of some contains of trails through four different forest types: deciduous trees, a coastal region with tree-size milkweed and prickly pear cactus, a mahogany forest, and twisted gumbo limbo trees. There are about 700 varieties of plants, including aroma (acacia) and guayacan (lignum vitae‚ÄîLatin for 'wood of life'). One guayacan is about 500‚Äì700 years old. The squat melon cactus and other cacti can be found here along with 40 species of birds, including the guabairo (Puerto Rican nightjar), found nowhere else. Also in the area are a crested toad (Peltophryne lemur) and, sometimes on the beaches, green and leatherback turtles, though their eggs suffer severe predation from mongooses one time introduced to fight rats in sugar cane fields. Barrios Subdivisions of Gu√°nica Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Gu√°nica is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as . #Arena #Ca√±o #Carenero #Ci√©naga #Ensenada #Gu√°nica barrio-pueblo #Montalva #Sus√∫a Baja Sectors Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci√≥n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. Special Communities Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods are in Gu√°nica: Esperanza neighborhood, Callej√≥n Mag√ºeyes, El Batey, El Tumbao, Ensenada, Fuig, La Luna, and Playa Santa.

History \\"Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. One of the houses in the company village for sugar cane workers\\" (1941 photograph by Jack Delano) Guayanilla was founded by Puerto Rican criollos. The original name was Guadianilla in memory of a river of the same name in Spain. However, it was changed to Guayanilla to resemble a native word in the Ta√≠no dialect. The name Guayanilla is derived from a combination of Guaynia and Santa Maria de Guadianilla. The first Europeans settled in this area in 1511. In 1756, Yauco was founded as a town. Then Guayanilla was a borough of Yauco. Due to the very fertile lands and access to the local port where most of the local commerce occurred, Guayanilla became an important agricultural center where sugar cane was cultivated. Guayanilla grew quickly and was established as a separate municipality on February 27, 1833 by Governor Miguel de la Torre. Hurricane Maria Hurricane Maria, with its significant rainfall, triggered numerous landslides in Guayanilla on September 20, 2017. 2019 - 2020 Earthquakes This Guayanilla landmark called Ventana was destroyed by the earthquakes On January 6, 2020 a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Guayanilla and several structures and cars were destroyed.

In Phrenology, approbativeness is a term used to define the faculty or mental power associated with desires such as esteem, ambition, and superiority.The American Phrenological Journal, vol.1, 1839, p.170. Nowadays, approbativeness is often linked to the emotion of vanity, and, as such, is distinguished from self-esteem, which is linked to the emotion of pride.

According to the 2000 US Census Hatillo is spread over nine barrios and Hatillo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Agust√≠n Ruiz Miranda, a Canarian immigrant, founded Hatillo on approximately ten (a cuerda is 0.97 acre, also called a Spanish acre) in 1823. Miranda granted this land on the condition that public buildings be erected and wide streets be built, and that the remaining land be sold or used for homes. In its first year, Hatillo had 910 people; increasing to 2,663 inhabitants the following year distributed among the central town and the barrios of Carrizales, Cap√°ez, Naranjito, Corcovado, Buena Vista, (formerly Yeguada Occidental), Campo Alegre, (formerly Yeguada Oriental), Pajuil, Bayaney, Aibonito, and Barrio Pueblo. Barrio Pajuil had disappeared by the 1940 census being divided up between Buena Vista, Naranjito, Corcovado and Campo Alegre barrios. There were also two sugarcane plantations named ‚ÄúHacienda Santa Rosa‚Äù measuring 150 and ‚ÄúHacienda Perseverancia‚Äù at 50 . The United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Espino barrio was 1,148. Hatillo, like several other municipalities on the island, experienced boundary changes from the 1902 municipality consolidation law (Consolidaci√≥n de Ciertos T√©rminos Municipales de Puerto Rico) in which Hatillo was annexed temporarily into neighboring Camuy. Three years later the territorial legislature approved the reformation of Hatillo as a separate municipality (independent town) from Camuy in 1905. In 1910, Barrio Pueblo (rural) changed its name to Hatillo barrio (rural). In 1930, Yeguadilla Occidental and Yeguadilla Oriental barrios' names were changed to Buena Vista and Campo Alegre, respectively. As mentioned before, Pajuil barrio disappeared by the 1940 census being divided up between barrios Buena Vista, Naranjito, Corcovado and Campo Alegre. In 1947 the Planning Commission of Puerto Rico issued a new map of Hatillo municipality and its barrios. As a result of this new map, the central town was expanded to include part of Hatillo barrio (rural) and the name of ‚ÄúCorcovados‚Äù was changed to \\"Corcovado‚Äù.

Among its monuments are the statue of Nemesio Canales and the bust of Hayuya, both by the Puerto Rican sculptor Tom√°s Batista. History The town of Jayuya was founded in 1911, but history traces non-indigenous settlers living in the region as far back as 1878. At that time, a small community was established there, separated from the larger cities of the coasts with little to no communication. Near the end of the 19th century, the town focused on the production of coffee, which greatly boosted the local economy. In 1911, the town was officially declared a municipality with a population of more than 9,000. In 1950, the town was the setting of the Jayuya Uprising, in which Nationalists started a revolt against the Government of the United States led by Blanca Canales, a social worker, and her cousins, Elio and Doris Torresola. Canales led the group into the town square and gave a speech, declaring Puerto Rico an independent republic. The police station was later attacked, telephone lines cut, and the post office burned to the ground. One police officer was killed and three others wounded in these attacks. The group held the town for three days, until it was bombed by U.S. planes supporting a ground attack by the Puerto Rico National Guard. Even though an extensive part of the town was destroyed, the news of the American bombing was not reported outside of Puerto Rico. Instead, it was reported by the American media stateside as an incident between Puerto Ricans. Most of Jayuya's population is of mestizo descent.

The woman represents - Mrs. Juana D√≠az, the towns namesake - with her hands the woman strews thirteen grains of corn into thirteen furrows, symbolizing the seeds that germinated and were the base for the foundation and growth of our town. The woman dresses as those of her time. The sun symbolizes a new horizon, hope in the formation of a town. The sun within the coat of arms has thirteen rays, each represents one of the barrios of Juana D√≠az.

Enclosing an area of , it is the largest known causewayed enclosure in Britain. The site was first occupied around 3800 BC, although the only evidence is a series of pits apparently dug by an agrarian society using Hembury pottery. During a later phase, c. 3300 BC, three concentric segmented ditches were placed around the hilltop site, the outermost with a diameter of 365 metres. The causeways interrupting the ditches vary in width from a few centimetres to 7 m. Material from the ditches was piled up to create internal banks, the deepest ditches and largest banks are on the outer circuit. The site was bought by Alexander Keiller in 1924 and excavated over several seasons from 1926‚Äì1929 by Keiller and Harold St George Gray whose work established it as the type site for causewayed camps as they were then called. Pottery from the bottom of the ditches was also the type style for the Windmill Hill culture. Later occupation layers contained early Peterborough ware, then the later Mortlake and Fengate varieties. Large quantities of bone, both human and animal, were also recovered from the ditch fill. The camp remained in use throughout the rest of the Neolithic with Grooved ware and Beaker potsherds having been found in later deposits. A Bronze Age bell barrow was later built between the inner and middle rings. Michael Dames has proposed a composite theory of seasonal rituals in an attempt to explain Windmill Hill and its associated sites: (West Kennet Long Barrow, the Avebury henge, The Sanctuary, and Silbury Hill).

It was used by the Wehrmacht in the European Theatre of World War II. M√∂belwagen in northern France, June 21, 1944 In 1943, due to the waning ability of the Luftwaffe to combat enemy ground-attack aircraft, ground-based anti-aircraft weaponry was becoming increasingly important to the Wehrmacht. In early 1943, the idea of creating a gun platform on the chassis of the Panzer IV was first proposed. The prototype displayed to Hitler on December 7, 1943, used the 2 cm Flakvierling 38, which was deemed too weak for the latest aircraft, which were constantly being improved to fly higher and faster. Only a single prototype with this gun was produced before the design was rejected. A second design with an upgraded single 3.7 cm Flak 43 L/89 was approved as a temporary stopgap until better Flakpanzers could be created. 240 M√∂belwagens were built, and the first production models were put into service on the Western Front in April 1944. The M√∂belwagen was built on Panzer IV chassis that had been damaged on the Eastern Front and returned to the factory for repair. These were fitted with an open-top superstructure that provided the gun mount. Around this, four hinged 20 mm armored plates were placed. These plates had two operating positions: they could be lowered for full 360 degree traverse, allowing flat or low-level firing, or they could be half-closed, being pinned together to hang slightly open. In this position, they had notches that allowed the gun full rotation, but only for firing at airborne targets. Still, both of these positions left the crew vulnerable. The fully closed position was only used for transport, when the plates would give the crew some protection from small arms fire and shrapnel. Though the M√∂belwagen was intended to be a stopgap, it served the anti-aircraft platoons of the Panzer Divisions on the Western Front. Only 240 were produced, and it was eventually succeeded by the first true Flakpanzers: Wirbelwind and Ostwind, both of which provided the crew with improved armored protection and full rotation when firing at either ground or air targets.

Maunabo is spread over eight barrios and Maunabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas- Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current mayor of the town is Jorge L. M√°rquez P√©rez and the population in 2010 was 12,225. History Maunabo was founded in 1799. Maunabo derives its name from a Taino Indian river name \\"Manatuab√≥n\\". When after the Treaty of Paris (1898), the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Maunabo was 6,221. Maunabo is known for its advances in media. Being almost \\"disconnected\\" from the rest of the island by its high mountains, the maunabe√±os created their own newspaper called La Esquina \\"The Corner\\" in English, on August 30, 1975 by Ram√≥n \\"Chito\\" Arroyo and Jos√© Orlando Rivera. It started as a community one-sheeter distributed free of charge only in Maunabo, but its popularity was so overwhelming that a year later it was transformed into a monthly tabloid. Today, the paper still is free of charge, home delivering 40,000 copies not only in Maunabo but also in the southeastern towns of Guayama, Arroyo, Patillas, Yabucoa and Humacao, and read by more than 190,000 people. Recently, the paper opened its new offices in Maunabo where they also work on La Esquina Online and other projects. Hurricane Maria Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Maunabo with the significant amount of rainfall.  Geography  Maunabo is surrounded by high mountains on two sides. The three major peaks are Pico Hutton on Sierra Guardarraya with an elevation of ; Cerro Santa Elena also known as El Sombrerito (or the \\"hat\\" for its unusual shape) on Sierra de Pandura with an elevation of ; and Cerro de la Pandura with an elevation of . The wind on these high points is so strong that it is hard to hear anything else but it blowing past your ears. At Sierra Guardarraya the strong winds have affected the growth of vegetation and the tall grass only grows flat to the ground. In the lush and tropical vegetation of Cerro de la Pandura you will find one of the Island's most endangered species of coqu√≠, the little frogs that sing like birds at night and which are endemic to the Island (though just recently a new species have flourished in the islands of Hawaii where they are considered a pest and are being exterminated by the local government). Known as the coqu√≠ Guaj√≥n (Eleutherodactylus cooki), this coqu√≠ can be found in the mountains shared by the neighboring towns of Yabucoa, Patillas and San Lorenzo. Though discovered in 1932 by Chapman Grant of the U.S. Army, it was not until 1997 that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared it an endangered species. Barrios Subdivisions of Maunabo. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Maunabo is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as . # Calzada # Emajagua # Lizas # Matuyas Alto # Matuyas Bajo # Maunabo barrio-pueblo # Palo Seco # Quebrada Arenas # Talante # Tumbao Sectors Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English).

Special Communities Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Maunabo: Matuyas, Sector Garc√≠a in Talante, and Batey Columbia in Calzada. Demographics Tourism Mauna Caribe, a which is a local type of bed and breakfast, tropical inn, is located in Maunabo. With an almost unspoiled culture‚Äîdue to the high mountains that separate the town from the rest‚ÄîMaunabo still is a very colonial city and the lack of large commercial chains gives it a unique personality compared to the rest of the island. The warm, unspoiled and untamed blue and green waters of the beaches of Maunabo are one of its major attractions. The three beaches (Los Bohios, Los Pinos and Playa Punta Tuna) are mostly visited by the locals all year round. The beaches also attract tourists that explore other regions beyond San Juan and other major cities. Surfers love these wild and dangerous waters. The Punta Tuna beach is also known by the locals as Playa Escondida or the \\"hidden beach\\", crowned by the Punta Tuna Lighthouse on one side and separated from the main road by lush sea grape trees on the other. The beach is only accessible by foot through a short dusty road. The sand at Los Pinos beach (the name means \\"the pines\\" and it comes from a pine-tree-lined hill on the side of the beach) shines with black carbon minerals and legend has it that these come from sea volcanoes or from underwater fossil fuel deposits. The minerals tend to stick to anything that is wet and thus it is rarely visited. The Los Bohios beach is a popular beach in town, attracting thousands of visitors each year. The town is also known for its Punta Tuna Lighthouse built by the Spanish at the end of the 19th century before the Island was turned over to the United States as spoils of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. Though it has never ceased working under the active management of the U.S. Coast Guard, for almost 30 years the lighthouse was not accessible to the public. Due to Law 180 presented by Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√°, the doors of the lighthouse were opened once again to the public in February 2006. The lighthouse is also a permanent symbol in the town's coat of arms. The town is also known for its annual crab carnival \\"Festi-Carnaval Jueyero\\" which attracts thousands of visitors for a three-day celebration with live music, street fairs, contests and much crab-based food. The carnival is celebrated during the first week of September, at the peak of the summer heat.

Transportation  The town constructed the first tunnel of the island which goes under the eastern side mountains connecting it with the neighboring town of Yabucoa. A Chilean construction company is in charge of the contract. The tunnels have been named Vicente Morales Lebr√≥n, after an environmental activist who, as a result of the 1956 tropical storm Betsy that damaged the only road that connected the town with the north side of the island, proposed the tunnels to be built. In September 2018, the tunnel was closed briefly for the filming of a music video. There are 22 bridges in Maunabo.

Its history stretches from the late fifth and early fourth millennia BC to the Roman invasion. The fort is situated on a south facing promontory at the end of a 240m high ridge in the Blackdown Hills. It lies to the north of and overlooking the River Otter valley and this location was probably chosen to give good views of the surrounding countryside as well as for defensive reasons.  Stages of occupation  Originally a neolithic site, an Iron Age hill fort was later built on the same site. It was excavated between 1930 and 1935 by Dorothy Liddell. She identified a timber framed entrance to the causewayed enclosure and an oval arrangement of postholes in the middle which she interpreted as being a building destroyed by fire before the enclosure earthworks were built. Other evidence of neolithic occupation included pottery, flints, axes, querns and charred grain. During an excavation in the 1980s headed by Malcolm Todd, archaeological evidence was found on the site of Roman military occupation, suggesting a fort within the existing Iron Age site.  Hembury ware  The site has given its name to some of the earliest Neolithic pottery in southern Britain after a large collection of pieces of this type of pottery were found during excavations by Dorothy Liddell. Hembury ware pottery was generally characterised by round bottomed bowls with lug handles. Much of it was made further west, around The Lizard using Gabbroic clay and it was traded throughout the British Isles. It was made at the end of the fifth millennium BCE and early 4th millennium BCE. Several pieces of Hembury ware Gabbro pottery are on display in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, Devon.

Naranjito is spread over 15 barrios and Naranjito Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The struggle to form the Naranjito town began in 1810. After a series of major incidents with powerful political interests of the time, on December 3, 1824, Don Braulio Morales successfully founded the town of Naranjito. The town was founded in the neighborhood of the same name, on a land donated by Do√±a Manuela Rivera and Don Braulio Morales. Morales was named \\"Captain Settler\\" and at the same time was appointed mayor of the town in development. The name \\"Naranjito\\" is derived from a small orange tree that served as a reference point for travelers looking for in the shortest way to the town of Toa Alta. At the time of its foundation, Naranjito consisted of five barrios/districts, \\"Lomas\\", \\"Guadiana\\", \\"Achiote\\", \\"Nuevo\\" and \\"Cedro\\". \\"Cedro\\" was divided in 1853 in \\"Cedro Arriba\\" and \\"Cedro Abajo\\", also having the urban zone composed by \\"San Miguel\\", \\"San Antonio\\" and \\"San Cristobal\\" districts.

The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds- eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.

The Boiling Nuclear Superheater (BONUS) Reactor Facility, also known to the locals as \\"Domes\\", is a decommissioned nuclear plant in Rinc√≥n, Puerto Rico. The construction of BONUS started in 1960, and the reactor had its first controlled nuclear chain reaction on April 13, 1964, achieving full power operation in September 1965. Operation of the BONUS reactor was terminated in June 1968 because of technical difficulties and the ensuing need for high-cost modifications. General decontamination of the reactor was performed with the goal of meeting unrestricted use criteria in all accessible areas of the building. Residual radioactive materials remaining in the structure were isolated or shielded to protect site visitors and workers. During subsequent years, more radioactive contamination was identified in portions of the building, and additional clean-up and shielding activities were conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was Puerto Rico's only nuclear reactor.

It lies at an elevation of above sea level and is directly overlooked by the rocky prominence of the Sphinx. The Jungfraujoch is a glacier saddle, on the upper snows of the Aletsch Glacier, and part of the Jungfrau-Aletsch area, situated on the boundary between the cantons of Bern and Valais, halfway between Interlaken and Fiesch. Since 1912, the Jungfraujoch has been accessible to tourists by the Jungfrau line, a railway from Interlaken and Kleine Scheidegg, running partly underground through a tunnel through the Eiger and M√∂nch. The Jungfraujoch railway station, at an elevation of is the highest in Europe. It lies east of the saddle, below the Sphinx station, and is connected to the Top of Europe building, which includes several panoramic restaurants, shops, exhibitions, and a post office. Several tunnels lead outside, where secured hiking trails on the crevassed glacier can be followed, in particular to the M√∂nchsjoch Hut. The normal route to the Jungfrau and M√∂nch starts from there. The Sphinx Observatory, one of the highest astronomical observatories in the world, provides an additional viewing platform at a height of , the second- highest in Switzerland. It can be reached by an elevator from the Jungfraujoch. The observatory houses one of the Global Atmosphere Watch's atmospheric research stations. The Jungfraujoch radio relay station, which is not accessible to the public, is installed west of the Jungfraujoch, on the Jungfrau ridge. It is Europe's highest radio relay station. Jungfraujoch (center, with the Sphinx Observatory) lies between M√∂nch (left) and Jungfrau (right) Etymology Swiss and Austro-Bavarian German Joch (lit. \\"yoke\\") is a term for \\"ridge between two higher peaks\\" recorded in the 14th century (Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch \\"bereits im 14. jahrh. als ortsname: des gotzhus zwing und ban vahet an Rotenhalden und denne die roten bachtalen uf unz an den grat, und den grat obnan hin ob Gr√ºblen hin iemerme, unz an Joch. und ab Joch unz an Stoerben. weisth. 1, 4 (Z√ºrich)\\"). The name Jungfrau (\\"maiden, virgin\\"), which refers to the highest mountain overlooking the Jungfraujoch, is most likely derived from the name Jungfrauenberg given to Wengernalp, so named for the nuns of Interlaken Monastery, its historical owner. However, the \\"virgin\\" peak was heavily romanticized as \\"goddess\\" or \\"priestess\\" only in late 18th to 19th century Romanticism. After the first ascent in 1811 by Swiss alpinist Johann Rudolf Meyer, the peak was jokingly referred to as \\"Mme Meyer\\" (Mrs. Meyer). Geographic setting The Jungfraujoch is the lowest point (key col) between the Jungfrau and the M√∂nch. The south side (canton of Valais), almost flat, is constituted by the Jungfraufirn, one of the branches of the Aletsch Glacier, the longest in the Alps. From the south, the Jungfraujoch can be relatively easily accessed by mountaineers in two days from the region of Fiesch, via the Konkordia Hut. The north side (canton of Bern) is almost vertical with a difference of height of nearly 3,000 metres from the bottom of the valley at Interlaken, with no easy natural access. For those reasons, the only easy and quick access to the Jungfraujoch is through the 7 kilometre-long tunnel of the Jungfrau Railway, accessed via Kleine Scheidegg on the north side, the railway pass between Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. Administrativelly, the Jungfraujoch is split between the territories of the municipalities of Lauterbrunnen and Fieschertal. The ridge between the Jungfrau and the M√∂nch is a major European watershed as well. The north side is drained by the Weisse L√ºtschine, the Aare and the Rhine. The south side is drained by the Massa and the Rhone. View from the summit of the saddle. From left to right: M√∂nch, Sphinx Observatory, Top of Europe complex, Aletsch Glacier and Jungfrau First ascent View from the Jungfraujoch towards Wengernalp and Interlaken. The Guggi Glacier is visible on the bottom right. There is a tradition in the Bernese Oberland, supported by some documentary evidence, that a pass existed between Grindelwald and Fiesch in Valais in the late medieval period, later lost to the advancing glaciers. With the early development of tourism in Switzerland and the exploration of the High Alps in the 19th century, there were once again attempts to traverse the great ridge that encloses the head of the Aletsch Glacier, and connecting the Eggishorn with Grindelwald and Wengernalp. Four such routes were found, with the Jungfraujoch and the Eigerjoch being among the most difficult passes in the Alps.John Ball, The Alpine guide, Central Alps, p. 106, 1866, London The first passage of Jungfraujoch succeeded in July 1862, by a party of six English climbers and six Swiss guides: Leslie Stephen, F. J. Hardy, H. B. George, Living, Moore, and Morgan, with Christian Almer, Christian and Peter Michel, Ulrich Kauffmann, P. Baumann, and C. Bohren as guides. The time of ascent from Wengernalp was nine hours. The party turned back on the first day at a bergschrund, returning on the following day with a ladder in length, carried by Peter Rubi, a porter from Grindelwald. The way lay at first by the rocky buttress of the M√∂nch, separating the Eiger and Guggi glaciers. From the buttress the route descended a short distance in order to reach the Guggi Glacier, which could be ascended to a plateau. This halting place was reached in about three hours. A crevasse near the M√∂nchsjoch Hut trail Above the bergschrund was a second and smaller plateau which was situated immediately under the long slopes of broken neve that lay below the saddle. The final and very arduous stage in the ascent was a single patch of dark rocks jutted out from the snow in the ridge connecting the Jungfrau with the M√∂nch. After more than an hour of climbing, a great wall of ice, whose projecting cornice of snow was fringed by long icicles, had to be avoided bearing left in the direction of the M√∂nch, along the base of the wall by a slippery pathway of ice formed from the dripping from the icicles above. At a point where the pathway thinned out nearly to a point, and was cut across by a transverse crevasse, the wall became low enough to be scaled by the ladder. This was the last serious obstacle: a moderate slope of n√©v√©, unbroken by crevasses, then led up to the summit of the saddle. After reaching the first patch of rocks, a short way below the saddle on the south side, the party divided: George and Moore, with C. Almer and U. Kaufmann went down to the Eggishorn, while the remainder of the party returned to Grindelwald by the M√∂nchsjoch. Jungfrau Railway History Adolf Guyer-Zeller first thought of the idea of a tunnel in 1893, and at that point, he had planned to have seven stations inside the tunnel before reaching the peak of the Sphinx. The building of the tunnel started on July 27, 1896 and took 16 years to complete. The construction phase was troubled by many problems including monetary shortages, inclement weather and mounting deaths due to construction accidents. The worst accident occurred in 1908, when 30 tons of dynamite accidentally exploded. When construction finally finished, the railway reached only to the height of the Jungfraujoch saddle, rather than the summit of the Sphinx, and had only two intermediate stations. However, even in its current state, the Jungfraubahn is a significant achievement in engineering and construction, still holding the title for highest railway in Europe. Railway The Jungfraujoch railway station at above sea level The train into the mountain leaves from Kleine Scheidegg, which can be reached by trains from Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen. The train enters the tunnel running eastward through the Eiger shortly after leaving Kleine Scheidegg. It runs close behind the Eiger's north face, stopping at Eigerwand, where there is a window about 8 m long and a metre high, halfway up the face. The windows have been placed in holes used to remove excavated rock from the tunnel during construction, and are also occasionally used as access points, by climbers, and also rescue parties. This window was used for one of the final scenes of a Clint Eastwood spy movie, The Eiger Sanction. There one can get off the train to admire the view before the train continues five minutes later. The tunnel then turns west, heading towards the Jungfrau. There is a second stop at a window looking out on the Eismeer (\\"Sea of Ice\\") before the train continues to the Jungfraujoch. The tunnel was constructed between 1898 and 1912; it is about long, with gradients of up to 25%. The journey from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungfraujoch takes approximately 50 minutes including the stops at Eigerwand and Eismeer; the downhill return journey taking only 35 minutes. The Jungfraujoch complex plays an important role in John Christopher's The Tripods novels. Climate Located above the permanent snow line, the Jungfraujoch is officially the coldest place in Switzerland,Swiss records - Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss although other higher locations with no weather station, for example the top of the nearby Jungfrau and Finsteraarhorn, probably experience a more extreme climate. According to K√∂ppen climate classification, the Jungfraujoch has an alpine climate on the border between tundra climate (ET) and ice cap climate (EF) with long, cold winters lasting most of the year and a brief period during summer where the average daily highs rise above freezing.

Sabana Grande is spread over seven barrios and Sabana Grande Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germ√°n- Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The municipality's name comes from the extensive plain that occupies the southern part of the municipality, better known as Sabana Grande Abajo. According to historian Mario Villar Roces, before 1808 there was a community with its own church on the land today known as Sabana Grande Arriba. Evidence of this is the oldest baptismal registry preserved from the area, as Sabana Grande was originally a sector of the municipality of San Germ√°n. Because the community was so far from the center of San Germ√°n, residents felt a need to build a church, which was established as an auxiliary to the San Germ√°n parish. The church was built and was devoted to San Isidro Labrador and Santa Mar√≠a de la Cabeza. During Spanish rule, in order for a town to be established, the following had to take place: A group of vecinos (\\"neighbors\\" or citizens) that wanted to found a town had to grant a power of attorney to one or more other vecinos to represent them before the governor and viceroy. This person could authorize the founding of the town and the establishment of a parish. The grantors of the power of attorney had to be a majority in the given territory and more than ten in number. Once the case had been made, the governor appointed a \\"capit√°n poblador\\" or settlement official to represent the vecinos and one or more delegates, who usually lived in nearby aldeas, or hamlets. Proof was required that the settlement was so far from a church that it was very difficult for the settlers to partake of sacraments and municipal services. In general, proof was provided of the absence or bad condition of roads and bridges. If the petition was approved, it was required that the vecinos mark off the new municipality and build public works such as a church, a parish house, a government house (Casa del Rey), a slaughterhouse, and a cemetery, and to set aside land for the town square or plaza and the commons (ejidos). The vecinos were expected to cover the cost of building these works by levying special assessments. Usually one of the land owners donated some land for the founding. Once the requirements had been met, the governor authorized the founding of the town and the parish, and he appointed a Lieutenant at War who usually was the same capit√°n poblador. There is some debate as to when Sabana Grande was founded. Some say that it was established in 1808, while others say it was established in 1813, a year after the town was politically established in 1812. Historian Villar Roces posits that although the exact date of the founding of the town is not found in any document in the municipal archives, 1813 should be considered the year it was legally founded because it coincides with the date of the first registry document. In entry number 23 in the third book of marriages, dated July 1, 1813, the priest is identified as \\"Priest Ec√≥nomo of the Sabana Grande Parish Church,\\" while previous entries were called \\"Attending Priests\\" or \\"Coadjutants of the Villa of San Germ√°n.\\" Sabana Grande became an independent parish, under its own jurisdiction, in June 1813, with the first parish priest of the San Isidro Labrador y Santa Mar√≠a de la Cabeza Church being Mart√≠n Antonio Borreli. On December 21, 1814, the first captain general of Sabana Grande, Pedro de Acosta, took office. Some local historians assert that he donated seventy cuerdas of land where the Kings House, priests house, a plaza, a butcher shop and a cemetery were established. Others say that this land was donated by Joaqu√≠n P. Rodr√≠guez de la Seda y Almod√≥var. Villar Roces adds that Juan Francisco de Acosta, brother of the mayor and parish priest of Sabana Grande, donated his house to the town so it could be used as the Kings House or council house. The first families of Sabana Grande were the V√©lez Borrero, Garc√≠a Almod√≥var, Nazario de Figueroa, Acosta, Sanabria, Lugo, Rivera, Sep√∫lveda, del Toro, Montalvo, Irizarry, Borreli, Ram√≠rez, Torres, Matos, Pab√≥n-D√°vila, Qui√±ones, Rodr√≠guez de la Renta, Soltero, Segarra, Ortiz de la Renta, Ortiz de Pe√±a, Saavedra and others. Also, Catalan families with the surnames of Busig√≥, Malaret and Serra, and a group of Greek immigrants with the surname Soto, all settled in the town from the time of its founding. Geography Valle de Lajas/Lajas Valley, November 2006 Sabana Grande is on the south west side. There are a number of rivers there: R√≠o Guanajibo and its tributaries, Coco River, Flores River, and R√≠o Grande. Hurricane Maria Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Sabana Grande with the significant amount of rainfall. Barrios Subdivisions of Sabana Grande.

Symbols Flag The flag of Sabana Grande has four squares, two green and two yellow, alternating. In the center is the municipal coat of arms. The meaning of the flag comes from the coat of arms. Coat of arms The municipality's coat of arms contains the elements that represent the town's patron saints. The shovel and rake allude to San Isidro Labrador. It is believed this representation arose from the faith of the workers in the Sabana Grande countryside. When a bad drought came, they made promises in the hopes that their patron saint would save their crops. The urn represents the domestic tasks of Santa Mar√≠a de la Cabeza, the wife of San Isidro. In the center is the leaf of the petate palm as an icon of a traditional industry of Sabana Grande.

San Sebasti√°n is spread over twenty-four barrios and San Sebasti√°n Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of the Aguadilla- Isabela-San Sebasti√°n Metropolitan Statistical Area.  History  1929 map of San Sebasti√°n The permission to found the town was officially given in 1752, under the leadship of the founder, Captain Crist√≥bal Gonz√°lez de la Cruz, who among other neighbors had an interest in converting some cow farms into an agricultural village. The foundation of the town from the religious aspect, was consummated in December 1762 by Mariano Martin, the island catholic bishop at that time. At the beginning, by 1700, San Sebasti√°n was a conglomerate of a few cow farms, owned by some residents of the Partido de Aguada. Las Vegas was the former plain site of one of the first cow farms located by the Guatemala riverside at the north. Also, another of those cow farms was Pepinito (today's downtown) that was a low green mountain with a white calcium carbonate face. On the north side of the town it can be seen some of this \\"pepinos\\" (cucumbers). These two cow farms gave the town its first name. From these geographical accidents come the first names of the new village: Las Vegas del Pepino (Cucumber Fields). In 1865 it is documented as San Sebasti√°n de Las Vegas del Pepino. At the beginning of the 19th century, wealthy Spanish families arrived in Pepino, fleeing the revolutions of Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Later, by 1850, several families from Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain joined the large number of isle√±os (Canary Islanders) that had made El Pepino their home. These people, after taking over the local political power, developed a coffee industry and brought some material progress to the town. The resident Basques in the municipality, in remembrance of their home region and its religious patron, saw the need of upgrading the old traditional Pepino used by the Canary Islanders to the new and \\"up-dated\\" San Sebasti√°n, promoted and thus got the name formally changed by the central government authority. Nevertheless, the citizens of San Sebasti√°n are called \\"pepinianos\\". San Sebasti√°n M√°rtir (Spanish for Saint Sebastian the Martyr) is the patron saint of archers and was chosen to be the patron saint of the town since its early history, first brought by the immigrants from the Canaries and later confirmed by the Basques, with the town name changed in 1869. Hurricane Maria Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in San Sebasti√°n with the significant amount of rainfall. The hurricane winds knocked all the power out and the town was left in the dark. The 40,000 residents of San Sebasti√°n were left without electrical power. Two weeks after the hurricane decimated the island, Javier Jim√©nez, the mayor at the time, noticed that help was not on the way. He decided that San Sebasti√°n would not wait for the AEE brigades to come. He assembled an ad hoc team of volunteers, some who were retired AEE electricians, set safety protocols, and their mandate was to get the electrical power back up and running for the people of San Sebasti√°n. Four months after the hurricane, they had restored power to 2,500 homes and continued to do about 60 homes each day. A monument honoring the accomplishments of the Pepino Power Authority, as they were quickly named, was erected in Plaza de la Identidad Pepiniana in San Sebasti√°n barrio-pueblo.

Trujillo Alto is part of the San Juan Metropolitan Area, which includes the municipalities of Bayam√≥n, Guaynabo, Cata√±o, and Toa Baja. The city is spread over 6 barrios and Trujillo Alto barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. Trujillo Alto was officially founded in 1801, but gained more importance during the 20th century. Due to its proximity to the capital, San Juan, the city has become a suburb of the metropolitan area, which has sparked its growth during recent years. The population of Trujillo Alto has increased through the last century from 9,576 (1930) to 74,482 (2010). According to the 2010 Census, it is Puerto Rico's tenth-most populated municipality. In 1953‚Äì54, the Carra√≠zo hydroelectric dam was constructed in Trujillo Alto by the Sumner Sollitt Construction Company of Chicago, under contract by the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority. The dam forms the Lo√≠za Lake, a reservoir which serves as the main source of the water supply for San Juan, Puerto Rico. History The region of what is now Trujillo Alto belonged to the Ta√≠no region of Cayniab√≥n, which stretched from the northeast coast of Puerto Rico into the central region of the island. The region was led by cacique Canoban√°. Archeological findings have identified two sites within the municipality of Trujillo Alto with archeological significance: Las Cuevas, which was studied by Irving Rouse, and Quebrada Grande. After the Spanish colonization, families started settling at both sides of the R√≠o Grande de Lo√≠za. During the 17th Century, the Spanish crown granted Alonso Pizarro Hermona, from Trujillo in Spain, a vast ranch that covered the region. Residents began using his family name to refer to the location. Eventually, the inhabitants went to the Governor and asked for permit to build a chapel, which was a requisite to officially found a town. Despite some opposition, Trujillo Alto was founded on January 8, 1801 under the name of Santa Cruz de Trujillo. Around 1820, the name \\"Trujillo Alto\\" was more used to differentiate the town from that of Trujillo Bajo (which later became known as Carolina). Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico marker on PR-181 In 1826, communication to and from the town improved with the construction of two bridges: one into R√≠o Piedras, and the other into R√≠o Grande. In 1844, Trujillo Alto was composed of only five barrios. A few years later, the first school was built. During that time, population decreased notably due to an epidemic of cholera. The United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish- American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Trujillo Alto was 5,683. In 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law for the consolidation of certain municipalities. As a result, Trujillo Alto was incorporated into the town of Carolina. However, in 1905 a new law revoked the previous one, turning Trujillo Alto into an independent municipality again. The proximity of the city to the capital, San Juan, has sparked significant growth and development in the region. During the 20th century, the population of Trujillo Alto increased dramatically. As of 2010, the city is the tenth-most populous city of Puerto Rico. Mayor Jos√© Luis Cruz Cruz, who has been serving since 2009, has labeled the city as \\"The New Metropolis\\". Hurricane Maria Working to restore power to \\"the small, mountain village\\" of Trujillo Alto, Dec. 24, 2017 Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Trujillo Alto with the significant amount of rainfall.

It is located north of Adjuntas and Ponce; south of Hatillo and Arecibo; east of Lares; and west of Ciales and Jayuya. In land area it is the third-largest municipality in Puerto Rico (after Arecibo and Ponce). According to the 2000 US Census, the city has a population of 35,336 spread over 24 barrios and Utuado barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The name Utuado derives from the Ta√≠no word Otoao, meaning \\"between mountains\\". The municipality is known as La Ciudad del Viv√≠ meaning \\"The City of the Viv√≠\\", derived from the Viv√≠ River which runs through Utuado: one river branch comes from Adjuntas and the other from Jayuya. These two rivers then meet near the Fernando L. Ribas Dominicci Avenue and continue the journey to Lago Dos Bocas. Utuado is the main city of the Utuado micropolitan statistical area and is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. History Utuado was founded October 12, 1739, by Sebastian de Morfi, on behalf of 60 families from Arecibo. It was the first town established in the interior, mountainous region of the island known as La Cordillera Central and the 11th oldest established municipality in Puerto Rico, following San Juan, San Germ√°n, Coamo, Arecibo, Aguada, Loiza, Ponce, A√±asco, Guayama and Manat√≠. Columbus's arrival At the time of the Spanish initial occupation of the island on November 19, 1493, by Christopher Columbus, Puerto Rico was inhabited by the Ta√≠no Indians. The Ta√≠nos were a culturally developed society with a universal language, a developed agricultural system, and a social organization based on caciques or chieftains. The Utuado area was ruled over by cacique Guarionex. In Caguana barrio, the Ta√≠nos built a series of courts or bateyes, Caguana Ceremonial Ball Courts Site, that is considered the best example of Taino engineering in the West Indies. Early history: XVI‚ÄìXVIII In his work , Jalil Sued Badillo gives a detailed account of the economic state of Puerto Rico during the first decades after the discovery and mentions the importance of the Otoao region. From 1510 through 1513, the island witnessed a Ta√≠no rebellion as a result of harsh and inhumane treatment by the Spanish settlers. During the process of pacification many Spaniards settled in the area now occupied by the municipality of Utuado and set up farms (haciendas), initially on behalf of the Spanish government (Hacienda Real Dos), to provide food to the Indian slaves working the gold mines and the Spanish colonists in the area. One of the first settlers in the Otoao region in 1512 was Antonio Sede√±o, the island's bookkeeper. His farm's main crop was yuca. His farm was sold in 1519 to Blas de Villasante, the island's treasurer, for 525 gold pesos. Areas in the Utuado region that were exploited for gold include Salto Arriba barrio, initially, then later in the 1530s Caguana barrio and Don Alonso barrio. In the 1530s, landowners in the Don Alonso area petitioned the Spanish Crown allow for the establishment of a town in the area but it was never granted. Once the gold mining era ends toward the end of the 16th century, very little is known about the Utuado region until the early 18th century. According to the Puerto Rican historian Fernando Pic√≥, the few documents that exist indicate the area was mostly unpopulated and densely forested. On the other hand, he states that Utuado is the municipality with the most caves, that most likely served as dwellings for Indians or runaway slaves. \\"Utuado Street Scene\\" from Harper's Weekly May 13, 1899 The agreement to establish the town of Utuado by the 60 families of Arecibo states they purchased the Hato de Otoao for 569 pesos and 5 reales from owners Manuel Natal and Felipa Rom√°n. It also states their desire to choose where on the land the town center would be located, which indicates the area was not populated yet. During his visit to the island in 1771, Fray I√±igo Abbad y Lasierra states the principal economic activity in the Utuado region was cattle raising, horses and mules. He mentions a small amount of agricultural activity existed but the population only produced enough tobacco and coffee for their own consumption. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Utuado's population continued to grow as coffee gained in importance and growers saw the need for high altitudes and mountainous terrain to produce the best coffee beans. People not only migrated from the Puerto Rican coastal towns but also from Ireland (Founder Sebastian de Morfi = Sebastian Murphy), Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands of Majorca and Menorca, all seeking the riches that coffee had to offer. Utuado was the first municipality to elect officials after Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. Golden era of coffee ‚Äì \\"black gold\\" Utuado in 1896 during the coffee golden era During the late 19th century Utuado experienced an explosive economic growth centered around the cultivation of coffee, also known at the time as oro negro or \\"black gold\\". By the 1890s Utuado was the largest producer of coffee in Puerto Rico and the second municipality (after Ponce) with the largest population. It produced a rich social life for many of its citizens and a casino and theatre were established in the town. The progress of the town was so evident that the regent Queen of Spain, Mar√≠a Cristina, honored the town with the title of Ciudad (City) on August 20, 1894.Archivo General de Indias, Reference Code: Ultramar 5147, EXP. 13, Document accessed and viewed at Archivos Espa√±oles en red: www.http://aer.mcu.es/sgae/ In 1896 or 1897 Utuado was the first city in Puerto Rico with a public electric lighting system powered by a hydraulic turbine power plant,Book: Utuado: Notas Para su Historia, Dr. Pedro H. Hernandez Paralitici, San Juan, 1983, Page 43 and in that same year mayor Juan Casellas planned a train system to unite Utuado with Arecibo. By 1899 this golden era ended due to two events: the United States occupation of the island in 1898, which made sugar the new crop of importance instead of coffee (Utuado's mountainous landscape was not ideal for growing sugarcane, making it impossible for it to compete in the sugar industry), and Hurricane San Ciriaco in 1899, which destroyed the coffee haciendas. Massacre El Imparcial headline: \\"Aviation (US) bombs Utuado\\" One of the most tragic moments in Utuado's history occurred on October 30, 1950, during the Utuado Uprising against United States rule, which culminated in what is known as the \\"Utuado Massacre\\". In Utuado a group of 32 nationalists, led by nationalist leaders Heriberto Castro and Dami√°n Torres, fought against the local police during the independence revolts which occurred in various cities and towns of the island. The group was reduced to 12 men and retreated to the house of Dami√°n Torres. Torres' residence was attacked by 50-caliber machine- gun fire from ten American P-47 Thunderbolt planes.Maria Rosado; Pedro Albizu Campos: Las Llamas de la Aurora; pp. 352, 353; Ediciones Puerto pub.; The National Guard arrived later that day and ordered the nine men who survived the attack to surrender. Once the nationalists surrendered they were forced to march down Dr. Cueto Street to the local town plaza where their shoes, belts and personal belongings were removed. The group was then taken behind the police station where they were machine gunned. Four of the nationalists died in the act, they were nationalist leader Heriberto Castro, Julio Col√≥n Feliciano, Agust√≠n Qui√±ones Mercado, Antonio Ramos and Antonio Gonz√°lez. Gonz√°lez, who was 17 years old, pleaded for water and instead was bayoneted to death. Hurricane Maria Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Utuado. In many areas of Utuado there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall. 171017-F-FH950-0631 (37544301410).jpgRelief efforts in Utuado 171017-F-FH950-0495 (37544302270).jpgResidents cross a river after the bridge is washed out 171018-A-PT541-008 (37802495951).jpgRelief efforts in Utuado on Oct. 18, 2017 171017-F-FH950-0935 (37544297560).jpgRelief efforts in Utuado on Oct. 12, 2017 171017-F-FH950-0126 (37544307650).jpgHuman chain to move supplies from the helicopter to the residents File:171017-F-FH950-0101 (37544308230).jpgResident was able to speak to her son three weeks later Geography Utuado is in the central mountainous region.

Although the city is inland, the municipality stretches to a southern coast facing the Caribbean Sea. Yauco is located south of Maricao, Lares and Adjuntas; east of Sabana Grande and Gu√°nica; and west of Guayanilla. The municipality consists of 20 barrios and Yauco barrio-pueblo. It is both a principal city of the Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area. It was founded by Fernando Pacheco on February 29, 1756, and developed for commodity crops of tobacco, sugar cane, and coffee. Yauco became a center for Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico in the 19th century due to its geographical similarity to their homeland. Corsicans have contributed to many areas of life in Yauco, particularly to its coffee industry. This has played a role in the city's nicknames of El Pueblo del Caf√© (City of Coffee), and Los Corsos (The Corsicans). It is also known as La Capital Ta√≠na (the Ta√≠no capital) after the native peoples of Puerto Rico. History Yucca The city of Yauco was named after the river Yauco, which the indigenous Ta√≠no called coayuco, meaning \\"yucca plantation\\".Yauco, Puerto Rico . Welcome.topuertorico.org. The Taino natives considered the area of Yauco the capital of Boriken (Ta√≠no name for what is today called \\"Puerto Rico\\") and was governed by Ag√ºeybana, the most powerful Ta√≠no \\"cacique\\" (chief) in the island. All the other caciques were subject to and had to obey Ag√ºeyban√°, although they governed their own tribes. Upon Ag√ºeyban√°'s death in 1510, his nephew, G√ºeyban√° (also known as Ag√ºeyban√° II), became the most powerful cacique in the island. Ag√ºeyban√° II doubted the \\"godly\\" status the Spaniards were rumored to have. He came up with a plan to test these doubts: he and Urayo√°n (cacique of A√±asco) sent some of their tribe members to lure a Spaniard named Diego Salcedo into a river and drown him. They watched over Salcedo's body to ensure that he did not revive. Salcedo's death convinced Ag√ºeyban√° II and the rest of the Ta√≠no that the Spaniards were not gods. They rebelled against the Spanish in 1511 but were defeated. In 1755, the Spanish settlers of the region built a small chapel and named it Nuestra Se√±ora del Sant√≠simo Rosario (Our Lady of the Holy Rosary). The settlers sent Fernando Pacheco as their representative to the Spanish Government, to request the establishment of a municipality, since they had satisfied one of the requirements for the establishment of a municipality, namely, to establish a place of worship. On February 29, 1756, the King of Spain granted the settlers their request and the town of Yauco was founded. Fernando Pacheco was named First Lieutenant of War of the new town. From the mid-19th to the early 20th century, hundreds of Corsican, Italian, French, Portuguese, Irish, Scots, and German immigrants arrived in Puerto Rico, attracted by the Spanish Crown's offer of free land. They settled mostly in the south central region. 19th century Corsican immigration Early Yauco coffee plantation (Pre-1920) The island of Puerto Rico is very similar in geography to the island of Corsica and appealed to the many Corsican immigrants. Corsica was part of the Republic of Genoa for centuries until 1768. Corsicans descend from a combination of ancient Corsi people from northeastern Sardinia and people who came over later from northern and central Italy (including Tuscans, Etruscans, Ligurians, and Romans) along with, to a lesser extent, Greeks and Carthaginians. It's been part of France since 1768, but retains a distinct Italian culture. Hundreds of Corsicans and their families immigrated to Puerto Rico from as early as 1830, and their numbers peaked in the 1850s, after European unrest following the Revolutions of 1848, and environmental problems of lengthy drought. The Corsicans tended to settle in the mountainous southwestern region of the island, and Yauco attracted the majority of them. As noted, the three main crops were coffee, sugar cane and tobacco. The new settlers first worked on the farms, and some saved money in order to own and operate their own grocery stores. They began to specialize in cultivation of coffee as a commodity crop. Coffee was first cultivated in the Rancheras and Diego Hern√°ndez sectors; it was expanded to the Aguas Blancas, Frailes and Rubias sectors. The Mariani family adapted a cotton gin in the 1860s to use in mechanical dehusking of coffee. This improved the appearance of Puerto Rico's coffee beans and helped it stand out in the international coffee market. By the 1860s the Corsican settlers were the leaders of the coffee industry in Puerto Rico, and seven out of ten coffee plantations were owned by Corsicans. Intentona de Yauco Flag flown by Fidel V√©lez and his men during the \\"Intentona de Yauco\\" revolt The pro-independence movement raised the second and last major revolt here against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, known as the Intentona de Yauco, a.k.a. the \\"Attempted Coup of Yauco.\\" The revolt, which occurred on March 26, 1897, was organized by Antonio Mattei Lluberas, Mateo Mercado and Fidel V√©lez. They were supported by leaders of \\"El Grito de Lares\\", the first major independence attempt, who were in exile in New York City as members of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee. During this uprising, V√©lez raised for the first time what became the current flag of Puerto Rico on local soil. Local Spanish authorities had heard rumors of the revolt and acted swiftly to suppress it.\\"Historia militar de Puerto Rico\\"; by H√©ctor Andr√©s Negroni (Author); Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ; Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Part of the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, where the Battle of Yauco took place in 1898 In 1898, upon the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Gu√°nica was a small barrio within the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and was defended only by eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique M√©ndez L√≥pez. When the convoy with General Nelson A. Miles, approached the barrio, Gu√°nica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera immediately alerted its residents. Nearly all the residents abandoned their homes and joined Rivera to go to Yauco, where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city's mayor. Only Agust√≠n Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan Mar√≠a Morciglio, Sim√≥n Mejil, Salvador Mu√±oz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena stayed to welcome the invaders. The first skirmish between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces was fought in that barrio between the Puerto Rican militia and twenty- eight sailors and Marines, under the command of Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood. They had come from the on rafts and landed on the beach, where Lt. M√©ndez L√≥pez and his men opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with a machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M√©ndez L√≥pez and three of his men were wounded, and the militia unit retreated to the town of Yauco. This was also the site of the first major land battle in Puerto Rico during the war between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces. On July 26, 1898, Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers, led by Captain Salvador Meca and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, fought against American forces led by Brigadier General George A. Garretson. The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in a firefight at the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, in what became known as the Battle of Yauco of the Puerto Rico Campaign. The casualties of Puig's forces were two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead. The Spanish forces were ordered to retreat. Earthquake in 2020 Multiple residences and structures in Yauco were damaged in a series of earthquakes with increasing magnitude that started on December 27, 2019 and culminating with a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the island in the morning hours of January 7, 2020. More than thirty-two residences collapsed and hundreds were structurally unsound after the earthquake struck near Yauco. To aid residents who were left without power or homeless, the National Guard was mobilized. A center for emergency operations was set up in the municipality's auditorium parking area, with air-conditioned tarps and tents for evacuated hospital patients and with food being cooked by World Central Kitchen. Hurricane Maria Significant rainfall from Hurricane Maria, on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Yauco, leaving entire communities cut-off. The Yauco River caused flooding that decimated entire neighborhoods. Geography Yauco is a mountainous municipality which is bisected by the R√≠o Yauco.

Born in the city of Ahvaz, in modern-day Iran, to an Arab father and a Persian mother, he became a master of all the contemporary genres of Arabic poetry. He also entered the folkloric tradition, appearing several times in One Thousand and One Nights. He died during the Great Abbasid Civil War before al-Ma‚Äôm≈´n advanced from KhurƒÅsƒÅn in either 199 or 200 AH (814‚Äì816 AD).  Early life  Nuwas's father, HƒÅnƒ´, whom the poet never knew, was an Arab, a descendant of the Jizani tribe Banu Hakam and a soldier in the army of Marwan II. His Persian mother, Jullaban, worked as a weaver. Biographers differ on the date of Nuwas's birth, with estimates ranging from 747 to 762. Some sources say that he was born in Basra.  Work  Ismail bin Nubakht, one of Nuwas's contemporaries, said: > \\"I never saw a man of more extensive learning than Abu Nuwas, nor one who, > with a memory so richly furnished, possessed so few books. After his death > we searched his house, and could only find one book-cover containing a quire > of paper, in which was a collection of rare expressions and grammatical > observations.\\" The earliest anthologies of his poetry and his biography were produced by: * Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn al-Fa·∏çl and Ya‚Äòq≈´b ibn al-Sikkƒ´t arranged his poetry under ten subject categories, rather than in alphabetical order. Al-Sikkƒ´t wrote an 800-page commentary. * Ab≈´ Sa‚Äôƒ´d al-Sukkarƒ´ edited his poetry, providing commentary and linguistic notes; he completed editing approximately two thirds of the corpus of one thousand folios. * Ab≈´ Bakr ibn Ya·∏•yƒÅ aI-·π¢≈´lƒ´ edited his work, organizing poems alphabetically, and corrected some false attributions. * ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn ·∏§amzah al-I·π£bahƒÅnƒ´ also edited his writings, compiling works alphabetically. * Y≈´suf ibn al-DƒÅyah * Ab≈´ HiffƒÅn * Ibn al-WashshƒÅ‚Äô Ab≈´ ·π¨ayyib, scholar of BaghdƒÅd * Ibn ‚ÄòAmmƒÅr wrote a critique of Nuwas's work, including citing instances of alleged plagiarism. * Al-Munajjim family: Ab≈´ Man·π£≈´r; Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn Abƒ´ Man·π£≈´r; Mu·∏•ammad ibn Ya·∏•yƒÅ; ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn Ya·∏•yƒÅ; Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´; A·∏•mad ibn Ya·∏•yƒÅ; HƒÅr≈´n ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´; ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn HƒÅr≈´n; A·∏•mad ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´; HƒÅr≈´n ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn HƒÅr≈´n. * Ab≈´ al-·∏§asan al-SumaysƒÅ·π≠ƒ´ also wrote in praise of Nuwas.  Imprisonment and death  Because he frequently indulged in drunken exploits, Nuwas was imprisoned during the reign of Al-Amin, shortly before his death. The cause of his death is disputed; some say that Nuwas died in prison, while others claim that he was poisoned. Nuwas was buried in Shunizi cemetery in Baghdad.  Legacy  Nuwas is one of a number of writers credited with inventing the literary form of the mu‚ÄòammƒÅ (literally \\"blinded\\" or \\"obscured\\"), a riddle which is solved \\"by combining the constituent letters of the word or name to be found\\". Ibn Quzman, who was writing in Al-Andalus in the 12th century, admired him deeply and has been compared to him.  Censorship  While his works were in circulation freely until the early years of the twentieth century, the first modern censored edition of his works was published in Cairo in 1932. In January 2001, the Egyptian Ministry of Culture ordered the burning of some 6,000 copies of books of Nuwas's homoerotic poetry.Al-Hayat, 13 January 2001Middle East Report, 219 Summer 2001 In the Saudi Global Arabic Encyclopedia entry for Abu Nuwas, all mentions of pederasty were omitted.  Monuments  The city of Baghdad has several places named for the poet. Ab≈´ NuwƒÅs Street runs along the east bank of the Tigris River, in a neighborhood that was once the city's showpiece. Abu Nuwas Park is located on the 2.5-kilometer stretch between the Jumhouriya Bridge and a park that extends out to the river in Karada near the 14th of July Bridge. In 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in honor of Abu Nuwas.  In popular culture  A heavily fictionalised Abu Nuwas is the protagonist of the novels The Father of Locks (Dedalus Books, 2009) and The Khalifah's Mirror (2012) by Andrew Killeen, in which he is depicted as a spy working for Ja'far al- Barmaki. In the Sudanese novel Season of Migration to the North (1966) by Tayeb Salih, Abu Nuwas's love poetry is cited extensively by one of the novel's protagonists, the Sudanese Mustafa Sa'eed, as a means of seducing a young English woman in London: \\"Does it not please you that the earth is awaking,/ That old virgin wine is there for the taking?\\" The Tanzanian artist Godfrey Mwampembwa (Gado) created a Swahili comic book called Abunuwasi which was published in 1996. It features a trickster figure named Abunuwasi as the protagonist in three stories draw inspiration from East African folklore as well as the fictional Abu Nuwasi of One Thousand and One Nights.

Athletes competing for the first time in any given league are also known as \\"rookies\\". Principal leagues The honor is awarded annually to the top rookie performers in: *Canadian Football League *Indianapolis 500 *IndyCar *Major League Baseball *Major League Lacrosse *Major League Soccer *NASCAR *National Basketball Association *National Football League *National Hockey League *Women's Professional Soccer Award outside North America Some rookie of the year awards exist outside North America, one example being the Elitserien Rookie of the Year in Swedish ice hockey. The North American sports development system delays athletes' entry into the top level of professional sports until the best of them are ready to make a major impact in their first season. The typical development path varies by sport: * American football ‚Äì Essentially all future professionals spend anywhere from three to five years in college programs, playing for a maximum of four years, before becoming eligible for professional play. * Canadian football ‚Äì Similar to American football, with players drawn from both Canadian university programs and U.S. college football. * Basketball ‚Äì Almost all American players now spend at least one year in college basketball because of recent changes in NBA rules. Although the NBA has its own minor league, virtually all players in that league come from the college ranks as well. * Baseball ‚Äì While college baseball plays a role in player development, it is significantly less than that of the extensive, and fully professional (bordering on semi-professional at the lowest level), minor league baseball system. Almost all players, whether or not they play college baseball, will spend several years in the minors before making a major-league team. * Hockey ‚Äì In Canada, a large majority of future NHL players develop as juniors in the professional Canadian Hockey League. While some American players opt for the CHL (which has some American teams), most choose college hockey. In either case, only the very top prospects will graduate immediately from the CHL or NCAA to the NHL; most will spend some time in an NHL team's minor-league system. However, in other parts of the world, it is usual for clubs to train their own players and introduce them into the first team gradually. Occasionally, young players who show extraordinary talent are introduced to the first team during their teens, with notable examples being Wayne Rooney in association football and Ricky Rubio in basketball. To reflect this difference Young player of the year awards with an upper age limit usually somewhere in the early 20s, are more common elsewhere, e.g. soccer's FIFPro World Young Player of the Year. However golf's PGA European Tour has the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year award, and Grand Prix motorcycle racing also awards the top rookie of each class.

History  When IBM and Microsoft were co-developing OS/2, they realized that the FAT file system did not offer some of the features modern OSes would require, and Microsoft began developing the High Performance File System (HPFS), codenamed Pinball. Instead of coding it inside the kernel, as FAT was, Microsoft developed a \\"driver-based\\" filesystem API that could allow them and other developers to add new filesystems to the kernel without needing to modify it. When Microsoft stopped working on OS/2, IBM continued using the IFS interface and Microsoft implemented a similar one in Windows NT. Implementations  IFS in DOS 4.x  IFS in OS/2 The IFS provided a basic and powerful interface for programming filesystems. It was introduced in 1989 in OS/2 1.20, along with the HPFS filesystem. Filesystem drivers executed in kernel-space (ring 0) and are divided in four principal pieces: microIFS, miniIFS, IFS, helpers. Only the IFS and the filesystem code itself is required and it is loaded via an \\"IFS=\\" statement in the CONFIG.SYS file. It is a NE 16-bit dynamically loaded library. No matter if it is a 32-bit OS/2 (2.0 and newer), the IFS is always 16-bit (although extraofficially you can make a 32-bit IFS). The microIFS is a piece of code that loads in memory the kernel and the miniIFS and jumps to kernel execution. It is usually in the boot portion of the filesystem. The miniIFS is a piece of code that is called by the kernel to load the first IFS statement that appears in the CONFIG.SYS file, so the first IFS statement must be the boot's filesystem for the system to be able to boot. The helpers are 16-bit (for OS/2 1.x) or 32-bit (for OS/2 2.x and up), are executed in user-space (ring 3) and contain the code used for typical filesystem maintenance, and are called by \`CHKDSK\` and \`FORMAT\` utilities. This four-piece scheme allowed developers to dynamically add a new bootable filesystem, as the ext2 driver for OS/2 demonstrated. CD-ROM filesystem driver (ISO 9660) was added in OS/2 2.0, UDF was added in OS/2 4.0 and JFS was added in OS/2 4.5. ArcaOS, the latest packaging of OS/2, has a number of filesystem drivers available, including FAT32. There was also an official 32-bit HPFS IFS, called HPFS386 that improved performance and added some features, like variable size cache and Access Control Lists, and was available only in certain OS/2 server editions. The FAT filesystem was never removed from the kernel and officially never an IFS, although there are FAT IFS that added features like long file names (LFNs), FAT32 support, etc. Network file-sharing protocols like NFS and SMB are also implemented using IFS, and the IFS interface never changed. IFS in Windows 3.11 and 9x IFSHLP.SYS (the Installable File System Helper) is an MS-DOS device driver that was first released as part of Microsoft Windows 3.11. It enables native 32-bit file access in Windows 386 Enhanced Mode by bypassing the 16-bit DOS API and ensuring that no other real mode driver intercepts INT 21h calls. The protected mode counterpart of IFSHLP.SYS is IFSMGR.386 in Windows 3.11 and IFSMGR.VXD in Windows 95 and Windows 98. IFS in Windows NT The IFS API is part of the Windows Driver Kit. When Microsoft stopped developing OS/2 and concentrated on what was then called OS/2 NT, they took the IFS ideas with it, along with the HPFS filesystem. Instead of being a four-piece scheme, NT IFS was redesigned into a two-piece scheme. microIFS and miniIFS were removed from the scheme. IFS and helpers remain as the same, but later, in Windows NT 4.0, a defragmentation helper (DEFRAG) was added. Microsoft's original NTLDR was coded for loading the NT kernel from FAT, HPFS or NTFS, but subsequent versions dropped HPFS support. All of the drivers and helpers became 32-bit PE executables. The FAT file system was moved out of the Kernel to an IFS and was heavily optimized for performance, taking advantage of the 32-bit processing capabilities (being called FASTFAT). Original Windows NT 3.1 incorporated FAT, HPFS (Pinball) and the newly created NTFS drivers, along with a new and improved CD-ROM filesystem driver that incorporated long file names using the Microsoft Joliet filesystem. Windows NT 3.51 added per-file compression to NTFS and to the IFS interface. In Windows NT 4.0 HPFS was removed. In Windows 2000 FASTFAT was updated to support FAT32 and UDF was added. Windows 2000 modified the IFS interface to add per-file encryption. Network file-sharing protocols and antivirus are also implemented using IFS. Apple started including read only HFS+ drivers in Mac OS X 10.6's version of Boot Camp for use in Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.

Africanus Horton was a surgeon, scientist, soldier, and a political thinker who worked toward African independence a century before it occurred. In his varied career, he served as a physician, an officer in the British Army, a banker, and a mining entrepreneur. In addition, he wrote a number of books and essays, the most widely remembered of which is his 1868 Vindication of the African Race, an answer to the white racist authors emerging in Europe. His writings look ahead to African self-government, anticipating many events of the 1950s and 1960s, and Horton is often seen as one of the founders of African nationalism and has been called \\"the father of modern African political thought\\". He wrote a book entitled West African Countries and Peoples (1868). A crater on Mercury is named after him.Terry Mahoney, \\"Africanus Horton\\", Mercury, Springer Science & Business Media, 2014, p. 49. Life Horton was born in the village of Gloucester, close to Freetown in British Sierra Leone. He was born James HortonAdi (2003), p. 86. in 1835 to the family of James Horton Sr; his father was a liberated slave of Igbo ancestry. Horton began his studies at a local school in Gloucester and in 1845, he was recruited by Reverend James Beale to attend CMS Grammar School. Thereafter, he moved to Fourah Bay Institution (later Fourah Bay College) to study divinity in the hope of becoming a clergyman. In 1855, along with William Davies and Samuel Campbell, he received a British War Office scholarship to study medicine in Great Britain. He studied at King's College London and Edinburgh University, qualifying as a medical doctor in 1859. While a student, he took the name \\"Africanus\\" as an emblem of pride in his African homeland. He published his dissertation, The Medical Topography of the West Coast of Africa, in 1858. Upon completion of his studies at Edinburgh, he was commissioned as an officer in the British Army and was made a Staff Assistant Surgeon becoming one of the earliest Africans in the officer cadre of the British Army. When he returned to Sierra Leone, he was posted to service in Ghana in the West India Regiment. In his army career, he was posted to various locations within the British colony, including Lagos, the Gambia, Sierra Leone and Ghana.Adi (2003), p. 87. Politics and writings Horton's first two publications: The Political Economy of British West Africa: with the Requirements of Several Colonies and Settlements (1865) and West African Countries and Peoples (1868) were a defense of Africans against racist views of some European anthropologists that Africans were a physically and intellectually inferior people whose development stopped centuries ago.Adeloye (1976), p. 4. He argued that all races have the faculty to acquire knowledge about philosophy, science and technologies that civilizations have developed over the ages.Martin, Guy. African Political Thought. New York, US: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. ProQuest ebrary, p. 48. Web. 22 April 2016. Horton was the first modern African political thinker to openly campaign for self-government for the West African colonies and champion the cause of what he referred to as \\"African nationality\\". Horton was an advocate of an elected monarchy in which a king would be elected by universal suffrage and bicameral legislature. In regards to the economic development of Sierra Leone, he proposed the annexation and commercial development of surrounding land in an effort to raise the revenue necessary to implement various economic and social development plans. In another of his publications, a compilation of letters called Letters of the Political Condition of the Gold Coast since the exchange of territory, Horton wrote about hostilities between ethnic groups in the Gold Coast and offered his views about solving the hostilities including the continuation of education in Africa. Horton was one of the first West Africans to demand the establishment of a medical school and higher institution in the region. Horton recognised the value in an indigenous institution and believed that it should be headed by an African, believing that they would be more invested in the progress of the country than a European. In 1861, he wrote a letter to the War Office in London, stating the need of a tropical medical school in the region.Adeloye (1976), pp. 4. After his retirement from the army, Horton started a finance institution called the Commercial Bank of West Africa. Personal life Horton married on two occasions while living in Freetown; he first married Fanny Marietta Pratt, daughter of the prominent Pratt family of Igbo origin. Marietta died at age twenty-two and Horton then on May 29, 1875, went on to marry Selina Beatrice Elliott (1851‚Äì1910), daughter of John Bucknor Elliott who was the manager of the Western Area of Freetown. The Elliotts were a Nova Scotian settler family of African-American descent. References Sources * * Further reading * Fyfe, Christopher.

She is the personal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the Daily Bugle, and served as both a supporting character and love interest for Peter Parker. She later became a reporter for the Daily Bugle and the girlfriend of Flash Thompson/Agent Venom. Since her inception, the character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as feature films, television series and video games. In film, she was portrayed by Elizabeth Banks in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, and by Angourie Rice in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Spider- Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, she first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (September 1963). Fictional character biography Betty Brant was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her mother had originally been the \\"Girl Friday\\" of Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson, and Betty dropped out of high school to become Jameson's secretary at the Daily Bugle. As Peter Parker's very first love,The Amazing Spider-Man #142 she met him when he became a freelance photographer for the Bugle.Amazing Spider-Man #4 After they had been attacked by the Vulture, Peter had already noticed his attraction to Betty, and was impressed when she stood up to Jameson over publishing slandering articles against Spider-Man. They began dating shortly afterwards, when Betty was impressed by Parker's kindness when taking care of his ill Aunt May.Amazing Spider-Man #9 Her secretarial job at the Bugle was taken to help her brother Bennett Brant pay back his gambling debts,Amazing Spider-Man #11 which he had acquired trying to pay for their Mother's medical bills. Bennett had become friendly with Betty's then boyfriend Gordon Savinski.Untold Tales of Spider-Man #12 Gordon was into many illegal activities and Bennett eventually took on a gambling debt that he couldn't pay back to a gangster named Blackie Gaxton. When Blackie's thugs came looking for Bennett at the family home, Betty's mother was knocked into a coffee table, resulting in permanent brain damage. With the help of Doctor Octopus, Blackie Gaxton kidnapped both Bennett and Betty as insurance against anyone preventing him leaving the country. Bennett was double crossed when Glaxton refused to free him of his debts and was fatally shot during a melee between Glaxton's gang, Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. At first, Betty blamed Spider-Man for the death of her brother and told Spider-Man that she never wanted to see him again, although afterwards she realized she had been wrong and that he had only been trying to help. The blossoming romance between Betty and Peter was cut short, when Betty feared that Peter cared more for his classmate Liz Allan.Amazing Spider-Man #13 This misunderstanding led to their relationship finally coming to an end.Amazing Spider-Man #17 Ned Leeds Soon after Peter and Betty's break up, she started dating fellow Daily Bugle employee reporter Ned Leeds.Amazing Spider-Man #18 Even though he soon left for Europe, they remained in contact, writing each other letters regularly.Amazing Spider-Man #23-24 Upon his return, they began dating again,Amazing Spider-Man #29 and Leeds eventually proposed to Betty. There were signs that Betty still loved Peter and Peter did his best to alienate her for her own good.Amazing Spider- Man #30 She eventually accepted Leeds' marriage proposal. After their engagement, J. Jonah Jameson threw an engagement party at his penthouse apartment and their wedding soon followed. Their wedding day was not all smooth sailing as a costumed criminal named Mirage decided to rob all the guests at the top weddings on that day. Spider-Man intervened and Mirage was easily captured. Betty and Ned were married with Mary Jane Watson serving as Betty's maid of honor.Amazing Spider-Man #156 Soon after their wedding, Jameson sent both Betty and Ned off to Paris, France on an all expenses paid working honeymoon. Betty began to notice a change in Ned as he became consumed by work. While Ned covered an insurrection in Cyprus she flew back to New York to the consoling arms of Peter.Amazing Spider-Man #184 After discovering Betty's disappearance Ned returned to New York and confronted both Peter and Betty. Ned punched Peter in the jaw and tried to force him to never see Betty again. Peter said he never wanted to see either of them again and that he was only interested in Betty to make Mary Jane jealous, in the hope that this would bring Ned and Betty back together.Amazing Spider-Man #195 After that, the villain Sin-Eater marks Betty for death, but she escapes his murder attempt.\\"Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\\" #107 (December 1985) Ned's investigative reporting brought an incredible strain on the Leeds' marriage. Following leads on the mysterious new villain named Hobgoblin, Leeds was captured and hypnotized to think that he was the Hobgoblin. During this period Betty turned to her friend Flash Thompson, but he too was framed by the real Hobgoblin and in the process Betty saw Ned dressed as the Hobgoblin threatening Flash. Her mind, already fragile, was pushed over the edge. Meanwhile, a mercenary named Jason Macendale asked the Foreigner for information on who the Hobgoblin was and was given Leeds' name. When Ned followed an espionage story to Berlin, under hypnosis he dressed himself as the Hobgoblin and was assassinated by the Foreigner's men. Macendale after thinking the original Hobgoblin was dead, would later adopt the identity of the Hobgoblin for himself. Betty suffered a complete mental breakdown after the news of Ned's death by the Foreigner,\\"Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine\\" (Feb. 1987) and believed him to still be alive. In her state a young recruiter from the Cult of Love was able to persuade her to join their faction under a leader called the Teacher where she was programmed in their ways.\\"Web Of Spider-Man\\" #40 (July 1988) The Teacher turned out to be a con artist. Flash and Spider- Man figured this out and saved Betty, though she lost everything she owned and had to take up residence with Flash Thompson. During this, the demonic events of Inferno happened, overwhelming much of New York City. Betty and Flash were attacked by demonic duplicates of Spider-Man and Ned. Betty overcame physical and psychological barriers and succeeded in destroying the monsters.\\"Spectacular Spider-Man\\" #148 (March 1989) After these difficult times, she returned to work at the Daily Bugle as a secretary under the city editor Kate Cushing. A change in Betty occurred when she became an investigative reporter who successfully tracked down the Foreigner and his assassins and found out the real identity of the Hobgoblin which finally put her mind at rest. She has now become one of the top investigative reporters at the Bugle. Deadline In Deadline, during her time at the Bugle, she became friends with Kat Farrell and pushed her to take on the Judge Hart case in order to get a better job at the Bugle.Deadline #1 She kept a spare key to Kat's apartment in her desk, which fellow reporter Paul Swanson used to break into Kat's apartment in an attempt to scare her off the case.Deadline #4 Brand New Day In Brand New Day's storyline, Betty became a reporter under Dexter Bennett after Jameson's heart attack forced his wife to sell the Daily Bugle to him, and she became the only one of the old circle to remain working at the Bugle. As Dexter was trying to sidestep Betty and make her his \\"Girl Friday\\" again, Peter drops hints of a fake family relationship between Betty and the deceased actor Marlon Brando, bolstering her position in Bennett's eye as a gossip reporter. Recently, she celebrated her birthday and asked Peter to organize for her friends to come over for a dinner, but due to her work at the new DB, nobody feels like befriending her. In fact, only Peter showed up at her birthday, because he was the only one of her friends that was not angry with her. Initially, Betty was furious at Peter, angrily accusing him of ruining her night until he tells her the truth. She is sad, but he reassures her that everyone will forgive her soon. Betty realizes that Peter really is her best friend. Following the DB's destruction, she went on to create a successful journalism blog; she is last seen with having gotten back together with Flash.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #648 Other versions Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Betty Brant is again the loyal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the Daily Bugle.Ultimate Spider-Man #8 She's a headstrong woman, trying to get by in life and having as much fun on dates as she can get. This version has a considerably different personality as she goes as far as making bets about the deaths of missing co-workers. She also lacks her mainstream counterpart's brown bob hairstyle and instead sporting long black hair (but her design was not concrete at the beginning of the series). She worked herself up into a rage while trying to build the Bugle website to which Peter Parker took over from her and got his job at the Bugle as a webdesigner. Jameson rejects her request to find out more about the disappearance of Nick Fury, alleging that a brief affair with Kraven the Hunter before his arrest proves that she is incapable of any reporting assignment beyond covering college fashion shows.Ultimate Spider-Man #121 Sometime after the original Spider-Man's death, Betty later gets the footage of the new Spider-Man stopping some muggers and presents this to Jameson.

Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #16.1. December 2012. Marvel Comics. What If? In \\"What If the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?\\", Betty is one of three candidates - along with Flash Thompson and John Jameson - who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave Spider-Man his powers. After confiding in Peter, and with his assistance, she begins to fight crime under the name \\"The Amazing Spider-Girl\\", with a mask similar to Spider-Man's but a very different costume. One time, she fails to stop a certain crook, who subsequently murders Peter's uncle Ben. The shock over the consequences of her failure makes Betty quit her Spider-Girl identity, although Peter takes up the identity of Spider- Man later on by synthetically recreating and ingesting the irradiated spider's venom.What If?

Jonah Jameson at the Daily Bugle.Spider-Man Noir #1 Spider-Gwen In the alternate reality where Gwen Stacy is Spider-Gwen, aka Ghost Spider, Brant is the bass player for the high school rock band the Mary Janes. Out of the four musicians (Mary Jane, Glory Grant, and Gwen Stacy), she is shown to have a larger interest in death metal and darker subjects such as horror. She has a cat named Murderface.Spider-Gwen Vol 2 #13 In other media Television * The character appears in the 1960s Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Peg Dixon. This version plays a larger role than other incarnations, similarly to Lois Lane in the Superman franchise, such as being captured by the villain Parafino and supporting Peter Parker and Spider-Man when J. Jonah Jameson criticizes them. * Betty Brant appears in the 1980s Spider-Man TV series, voiced by Mona Marshall. * Betty Brant appears in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Grey DeLisle. This version is J.

Jonah Jameson's secretary at the Daily Bugle. She first appears in \\"Take Two\\", where Jameson has her give Peter Parker a check after he obtained footage of Spider-Man's fight with the Wild Pack. Films Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant in Spider-Man 3 * Betty Brant appears as a minor character in the original Spider-Man film series, portrayed by Elizabeth Banks. Betty appears in all three films in the series, starting with Spider- Man and reappearing in its sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. As one of the Bugle staff and J. Jonah Jameson's secretary, she is usually seen either passing on messages to Jonah or receiving curt orders from him. While she never dates Peter Parker, a subtle attraction to him is apparent in the first two films. Elizabeth Banks stated that she first auditioned for the role of Mary Jane Watson before taking the role of Betty Brant. Banks also admitted that the groundwork of her role as the fictional character's relationship between her and Peter Parker is much closer to the office romance that the two shared in the comics. * Angourie Rice portrays a teenage Betty Brant in the Spider-Man films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This version of the character, in terms of appearance, bears a similarity to Gwen Stacy, having long blonde hair and often wearing a black headband. ** The character made her debut in Spider-Man: Homecoming as a student of Midtown Science High School, Liz Allan's best friend, and host of the school's news report. ** Betty returned in Spider-Man: Far From Home, having entered a relationship with Ned Leeds, though they break up near the end of the film and maintain their friendship.

But during Ralph's chancellorship, Ralph was one of the royal officials that urged Arnulf to resign his bishopric. Arnulf was suspected by King Henry of supporting Henry's sons in their Revolt of 1173‚Äì74, and eventually Arnulf was forced to resign his see.Warren Henry II p. 211 Ralph also had custody of the castle and royal lands at Vaudreuil in Normandy in the 1180s, and was still owing accounts for his administration at his death.

Called Timbuktu‚Äôs greatest scholar, he wrote more than 40 books. He died in 1627. Life A·∏•mad BƒÅbƒÅ was born on October 26, 1556 in Araouane to the Sanhaja Berber Aqit family. He moved to Timbuktu at an early age where he studied with his father, A·∏•mad ibn al-·∏§ƒÅjj A·∏•mad ibn ‚ÄòUmar ibn Mu·∏•ammad Aqƒ´t, and the scholar Mohammed Bagayogo (var. Baghayu'u); there are no other records of his activity until 1594, when he was deported to Morocco over accusations of sedition, after the Moroccan invasion of Songhai where he remained in Fez until the death of Ahmad al-Mansur. His successor, Zaydan An-Nasser, allowed all exiles to return to their country. A·∏•mad BƒÅbƒÅ reached Timbuktu on April 22, 1608. Legacy A fair amount of the work he was noted for was written while he was in Morocco, including his biography of Muhammad Abd al-Karim al-Maghili, a scholar and jurist responsible for much of the traditional religious law of the area. A biographical note was translated by M.A. Cherbonneau in 1855,. and became one of the principal texts for study of the legal history of the Western Sudan.. Ahmad Baba's surviving works remain the best sources for the study of al- Maghili and the generation that succeeded him.. Ahmad Baba was considered the Mujjadid (reviver of religion) of the century. The only public library in Timbuktu, the Ahmed Baba Institute (which stores over 18,000 manuscripts) is named in his honor.Curtis Abraham, \\"Stars of the Sahara,\\" New Scientist, 18 August 2007: 38 In 1615 Ahmad discussed along with other Muslim scholars on the question of slavery, in order to protect Muslims from being enslaved. He is known to have provided one of the first ideas of ethnicity within West Africa. Stance on Race Ahmad Baba made an effort to end racial slavery and criticised the association of Black Africans with slaves, particularly criticising some Muslims adopting the narrative of the Curse of Ham, found in the book of Genesis.  Stance on Slavery  The ladder of ascent in obtaining the procurements of the Sudan: Ahmad Baba answers a Moroccan‚Äôs questions about slavery, manuscript at the Mamma Haidara Memorial LibraryIn regards to the enslavement of Africans in 1615, Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ discussed the legitimate reasons of how and why one could become a slave. The driving force, mainly being religious and ethnic, were that if one came from a country with a Muslim government, or identified with specific Muslim ethnic groups, then they could not be slaves. He claimed that if a person was an unbeliever or a kafara, then that is the sole factor for their enslavement, along with that being ‚Äúthe will of God.‚Äù In the piece Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ and the Ethics of Slavery, he claims that his beliefs fueled the thought that those who identified as Muslim no longer had to be enslaved, but anyone that was an outsider (or nonbeliever) would then be enslaved by Muslims. These were not simply beliefs these were the rules that are given by God Most High, who knows best. Even in the case that the people of the country were believers but their belief was shallow then those people could still be enslaved with no questions asked. According to Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ, it was known that the people of Kumbe were shallow in their beliefs. He goes on to use the analogy that when one country is conquered and contains nonbelievers, then those persons could be enslaved as part of his stance on any other outsider or religion besides Islam. This is a different kind of thinking in comparison to the works of William D. Phillips Jr., who wrote The Middle Ages Series: Slavery in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia. In his piece, the main factor that distinguished a slave from an ordinary person would be their religious differences. This ties into Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ's ideas about enslavement involving everyone except those who practiced Islam. More specifically to his ideas on slavery, Phillips discussed how Christians enslaved Muslims, and Muslims enslaved Christians. However, Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ's hope was to end the enslaving of Muslims entirely and instead have other religious groups be enslaved, as they were considered to be unbelievers of the Muslim faith. Another contradicting idea, discussed in the article Slavery in Africa by Suzanne Meirs and Igor Kopytoff, was that enslavement was based on people who are forced out of their homeland into a completely foreign area, tying into Ahmad's beliefs. Meirs and Kopytoff discuss the possibility of being accepted into a community through means of earning their freedom, being granted freedom by their owner, or being born into freedom. But in Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ's perspective, if one converted to Islam and were once an ‚Äúunbeliever‚Äù before being enslaved, then that individual would still hold that title of being a slave. An unbeliever was classified as anyone who was Christian, Jewish, etc. however Ahmad BƒÅbƒÅ states that there are no differences between unbelievers regardless of their different religious beliefs of Christianity, Persian, Jews, etc. Notes References Hunqick J. and Harrak F.

He is considered to be one of the most famous and influential Brazilian Romantic novelists of the 19th century, and a major exponent of the literary tradition known as \\"Indianism\\". Sometimes he signed his works with the pen name Erasmo. He was patron of the 23rd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Biography The house where Jos√© de Alencar was born and lived in until 1844, in the Messejana neighborhood, in Fortaleza Jos√© Martiniano de Alencar was born in Messejana, Fortaleza, Cear√°, on May 1, 1829, to politician Jos√© Martiniano Pereira de Alencar and his cousin Ana Josefina de Alencar. His family was a rich and influential clan in Northeastern Brazil, his grandmother being famous landowner Barbara Pereira de Alencar, heroine of the Pernambucan Revolution. Moving to S√£o Paulo in 1844, he graduated in Law at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S√£o Paulo in 1850 and started his career in law in Rio de Janeiro. Invited by his friend Francisco Otaviano, he became a collaborator for the journal Correio Mercantil. He also wrote many chronicles for the Di√°rio do Rio de Janeiro and the Jornal do Commercio. Alencar would compile all the chronicles he wrote for these newspapers in 1874, under the name Ao Correr da Pena. It was in the Di√°rio do Rio de Janeiro, during the year of 1856, that Alencar gained notoriety, writing the Cartas sobre A Confedera√ß√£o dos Tamoios, under the pseudonym Ig. In them, he bitterly criticized the homonymous poem by Gon√ßalves de Magalh√£es. Even the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, who esteemed Magalh√£es very much, participated in this polemic, albeit under a pseudonym. Also in 1856, he wrote and published under feuilleton form his first romance, Cinco Minutos, that received critical acclaim. In the following year, his breakthrough novel, O Guarani, was released; it would be adapted into a famous opera by Brazilian composer Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes 13 years later. O Guarani would be first novel of what is informally called Alencar's \\"Indianist Trilogy\\" ‚Äì a series of three novels by Alencar that focused on the foundations of the Brazilian nation, and on its indigenous peoples and culture. The other two novels, Iracema and Ubirajara, would be published on 1865 and 1874, respectively. Although called a trilogy, the three books are unrelated in their plots. Alencar was affiliated with the Conservative Party of Brazil, being elected as a general deputy for Cear√°. He was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1868 to 1870, having famously opposed the abolition of slavery.https://www.hedra.com.br/livros/cartas-a- favor-da-escravidao He also planned to be a senator, but Pedro II never appointed him, under the pretext of Alencar being too young;RODRIGUES, Antonio Edmilson Martins; FALCON, Francisco Jos√© Calazans. Jos√© de Alencar: O Poeta Armado do S√©culo XIX. [S.l.]: FGV Editora, 2001. with his feelings hurt, he would abandon politics later. He was very close friends with the also famous writer Machado de Assis, who wrote an article in 1866 praising his novel Iracema, that was published the year before, comparing his Indianist works to Gon√ßalves Dias, saying that \\"Alencar was in prose what Dias was in poetry\\". When Assis founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1897, he chose Alencar as the patron of his chair. Monument to Jos√© de Alencar in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1864 he married Georgina Augusta Cochrane, daughter of an eccentric British aristocrat. They would have six children ‚Äì Augusto (who would be the Brazilian Minister of External Relations in 1919, and also the Brazilian ambassador on the United States from 1920 to 1924), Clarisse, Ceci, Elisa, M√°rio (who would be a journalist and writer, and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters) and Ad√©lia. (It is implied that M√°rio de Alencar was actually an illegitimate son of Machado de Assis, a fact that inspired Assis to write his famous novel Dom Casmurro.M√°rio de Alencar: Machado de Assis' son? ) Alencar died in Rio de Janeiro in 1877, a victim of tuberculosis. A theatre in Fortaleza, the Theatro Jos√© de Alencar, was named after him.

The identity of his mother is uncertain, but she may have been named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189. In 1173‚Äì1174, he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of William, King of Scots. By 1182, Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop; he chose to resign and became Chancellor instead. He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at the king's death. Geoffrey's half-brother Richard I nominated him archbishop of York after succeeding to the throne of England, probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. After some dispute Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191. He soon became embroiled in a conflict with William Longchamp, Richard's regent in England, after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France. Geoffrey claimed sanctuary in the town, but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in Dover Castle. Subsequently, a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office, and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese. The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half-brothers: first Richard and then John, who succeeded to the English throne in 1199. Geoffrey also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, his cathedral chapter, and other clergy in his diocese. His last quarrel with John was in 1207, when the archbishop refused to allow the collection of a tax and was driven into exile in France. He died there five years later. Early life Henry II with 300px Geoffrey was probably born in about 1152,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops before his father Henry, later Henry II of England, married Eleanor of Aquitaine,Warren Henry II p. 78 note 1 and was likely named after his paternal grandfather, Geoffrey of Anjou. Although he is often given the surname \\"Plantagenet\\" in modern histories, that name was not in use during his lifetime.Given-Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards pp. 103‚Äì104 The date of his birth is determined by statements of Gerald of Wales that he was barely 20 when elected bishop in 1173, and by the fact that he was about 40 when consecrated archbishop in 1191. His mother's identity is unclear. The medieval chronicler Walter Map claimed she was a whore named Ykenai, and that he was not actually Henry's son. This is the only contemporary source that gives her name, and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey, the information must be judged carefully. Instead, Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight. Another possibility for Geoffrey's mother is Rosamund Clifford, but most of the evidence for this is circumstantial. It is assumed that Geoffrey was the eldest of Henry's children, legitimate or illegitimate. Geoffrey was brought up with Henry's legitimate children. There is no evidence that Henry tried to deny Geoffrey's paternity, although Walter Map said that Henry's acknowledgment was done \\"improperly and with little discretion\\".Quoted in Jones \\"Generation Gap\\" Albion p. 28 Geoffrey had a brother named Peter, who appears to have been his maternal half-brother,Given-Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards p. 118 as Peter is generally considered unlikely to have been Henry's son.Given-Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards p. 179 Geoffrey was Archdeacon of Lincoln in the diocese of Lincoln by September 1171, and probably retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons of Lincoln He also held a prebend, an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter,McGurk Dictionary p. 32 in the diocese of London, but there is little evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in Northampton, and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a papal judge-delegate at that time. Pope Alexander III initially refused to confirm Geoffrey's selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not ordained at that time,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops of Lincoln as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric.Morey Bartholomew of Exeter p. 37 Geoffrey's youth was one of Alexander's objections to Geoffrey's election, and the pope only confirmed the office under duress. Another potential problem was Geoffrey's illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.Cheney Roger of Worcester p. 215 In 1173 and early 1174 Geoffrey fought a military campaign in northern England in support of his father's attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the rebellion by Geoffrey's legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of William the Lion, the King of Scots, at the Battle of Alnwick and also helped to compel Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to pledge fealty to Henry II.Lovatt \\"Geoffrey\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography During the campaign, Geoffrey captured several castles held by Roger Mowbray, a supporter of the Scottish king.Scammell Hugh du Puiset pp. 38‚Äì39 It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey \\"My other sons are the real bastards. ... This is the only one who's proved himself legitimate!\\"Quoted in Lovatt \\"Geoffrey\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at Tours, where he probably befriended Peter of Blois, a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St Wilfrid to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower. While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that Adam, Bishop of St Asaph, carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions.Richardson \\"Schools of Northampton\\" English Historical Review p. 599 Nevertheless, he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey was never going to be ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect's position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation. Chancellor Geoffrey formally resigned the see of Lincoln on 6 January 1182,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 255 at Marlborough in England, rather than be ordained as Pope Lucius III had ordered. Henry had named him Chancellor of England in 1181,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 84 after Geoffrey indicated he was going to resign the bishopric in February 1181. Although Geoffrey resigned the episcopal office, he continued to hold benefices in plurality, which was normally contrary to canon law.Hamilton Religion in the Medieval West p. 39 These offices included the Treasurer of York from 1182, the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Treasurers of York and probably the Archdeaconry of East Riding.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Prebends of York Henry also gave him two continental castles, one in Anjou and one in Touraine, along with lands in England and Normandy worth 1000 marks a year. Although Geoffrey held the office of Chancellor, he appears in only few documents, mainly between 1182 and 1185. After 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187, and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father's domains. Peter of Blois wrote that several monarchs considered Geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land, and that he was actually offered the throne of Jerusalem by Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem.Wahlgren \\"Peter of Blois\\" English Historical Review p. 1212 It is possible that Geoffrey's non-appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father's domains in pursuit of these ambitions. During Geoffrey's term of office as Chancellor Walter de Coutances served as his \\"seal-keeper\\"; the need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to the likelihood that Geoffrey's time as Chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father. William Longchamp fulfilled the same assistant role for the archdeaconry at Rouen.Spear Personnel p. 216 Following the declaration of war on Henry by Prince Richard and King Philip II of France in 1187, Geoffrey was given command of a quarter of the English royal army. He and his father were driven from Le Mans, Henry's birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester, and Geoffrey used his father's seal to make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial. He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at his death.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 233‚Äì236 Archbishop First difficulties Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189,Turner \\"Richard Lionheart and English Episcopal Elections\\" Albion p. 4 within days of taking the throne; the formal election took place on 10 August. What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, as well as the exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place until much later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, as archbishop. Richard probably gave York to Geoffrey in the hope of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne.Warren King John p. 39Turner King John pp. 35‚Äì36 Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected to be out of the country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart pp. 89‚Äì90 But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16 September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives. Geoffrey's ordination as a priest took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported by most of the York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of ¬£2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment. In early 1190 Geoffrey ordered a halt to religious ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing to go on the Third Crusade, ordered Geoffrey to the king's presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was Justiciar, was hampering Geoffrey's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine, Richard insisted on immediate full payment. When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re-confiscated his lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey's election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey's estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of his fine. Consecration and more difficulties 300px Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 281 at Tours in France, by Barthelemy de Vend√¥me, the Archbishop of Tours, after the papacy agreed to allow the consecration. This permission was secured by the intervention of the king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support as part of an effort to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart p. 123 Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle.Warren King John p. 42 Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart pp. 126‚Äì128 One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred.Gillingham Richard I p. 228 The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship,Powell and Wallis House of Lords pp. 98‚Äì99 and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191. While still embroiled in his conflict with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey's authority in Puiset's diocese of Durham, one of those subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king. York had been vacant for several years, and Puiset had grown used to having untrammelled authority in the northern archdiocese.Scammell Hugh du Puiset p. 172 After Geoffrey's consecration, he summoned Puiset to a provincial synod in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey's authority over Durham.Scammell Hugh du Puiset pp. 178‚Äì181 Geoffrey caused offence by his attempts to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury, thus implying that his diocese was superior or at least equal to Canterbury in rank. In pursuit of this rivalry between York and Canterbury, Geoffrey was the first archbishop of York to style himself \\"Primate of England\\", in opposition to the Canterbury title of \\"Primate of all England\\".Cheney Hubert Walter pp. 52‚Äì53 He also attempted to subordinate Clementhorpe Priory to Godstow Abbey, which provoked an appeal from Prioress Alice of Clementhorpe to the papacy. Probably owing to Pope Celestine III's dislike of Geoffrey, Hubert Walter was given a papal legateship that included Geoffrey's province, something that had not been usual in the preceding years, and which presented Geoffrey with some difficulties in his dealings with the ecclesiastical hierarchy.Robinson Papacy p. 173 But Geoffrey was on friendly terms with Prince John; the historian G. V. Scammell has suggested that Geoffrey's consecration allowed John to feel that Geoffrey was no longer a rival for the throne, thus paving the way for good relations between the two half-brothers.Scammell Hugh du Puiset p. 55 Geoffrey long faced opposition from some members of his cathedral chapter led by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They objected to his having given a large part of York's treasury toward Richard's ransom, and to some of his appointments in the church of York. Charges of simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey, who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York; his first choice, his half-brother Peter, was opposed by the cathedral chapter. Geoffrey's second choice, Simon of Apulia, the chancellor of York, refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man, Philip of Poitou. Simon was supported by the cathedral chapter, who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey's opposition. An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon travelled to King Richard in Germany. The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany to resolve the issue. Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy, and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York. Quarrels with John, Hubert Walter and Richard When Prince John rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset put aside their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey strengthened Doncaster's defences and went to the aid of Puiset, who was besieging Tickhill Castle. In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself.Gillingham Richard I p. 270 Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the primacy of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter's decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and even went so far as to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey's actions, which led to Geoffrey's estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in Maine; Richard over- ruled Walter, restored Geoffrey's estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow. In January 1195 Geoffrey was ordered to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of suspension from office if he did not appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a legatine council at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23 December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He travelled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope. Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy while the archbishop was attempting to return to England. Richard forbade him from administering York,Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 305‚Äì306 and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198. An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing, after Geoffrey refused to approve the king's appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees that they would be approved by the papacy. Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28 April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval. Under John After John succeeded Richard in 1199, he decided to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but continued to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome.Gillingham \\"Historians without Hindsight\\" King John p. 13 Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and for a short time peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200. In October 1200 Geoffrey refused to allow the collection of carucage, a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, James of Poterne, who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother,Joliffe Angevin Kingship pp.114‚Äì115 but it did not last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were Guisborough Priory, Meaux Abbey, and Fountains Abbey. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house. Geoffrey submitted to John in 1206, and his lands were returned to him. But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile.Warren King John p. 149 Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates in retaliation.Mitchell Taxation in Medieval England pp. 177‚Äì178 Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey's possessions, but in the meantime the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, Geoffrey of Coldingham, stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John. Death and legacy Life of Christ in the Leiden St Louis Psalter made for Geoffreyupright260px Geoffrey died while still in exile at Grandmont in Normandy on 12 December 1212. He was buried at a Grandmontine monastery near Rouen, where he had been living for a few years.Hallam \\"Henry II, Richard I and the order of Grandmont\\" Journal of Medieval History p. 171 His tomb was still extant in 1767, when the inscription on it was recorded by an antiquary. He may have become a monk before his death. Although his archiepiscopate was mainly marked by the conflicts in which he engaged, Geoffrey also managed to institute some administrative reforms in his diocese, creating the office of chancellor. He also inspired loyalty from some of his household members, many of whom witnessed his charters, and although he made enemies of several of the suffragan bishops, clergy and religious houses in his diocese, he also secured the friendship and support of other clergy, including Pope Innocent III and Hugh of Lincoln. Although Walter Map declared that Geoffrey was \\"full of faults and devoid of character\\", he remained loyal to his father until Henry's death. A modern-day historian, Thomas Jones, summed up Geoffrey's character with the phrase \\"quarrelsome and undiplomatic\\".Jones \\"Generation Gap\\" Albion p. 28 Another historian, J. C. Holt, stated that Geoffrey was through his career \\"a perpetual source of danger, quarrelling now with de Puiset, now with the Yorkshire sheriffs, ever ready to attack the judicial and fiscal superiority of the Crown.\\"Holt Northerners p. 204 Geoffrey's ambitions may have included becoming King of England, which may account for some of the harshness that his two legitimate half-brothers displayed towards him. His military abilities, displayed in the rebellion of 1173‚Äì1174, as well his custody of castles near Tours, would have also fed into Richard's disquiet over Geoffrey's possible intentions.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart pp. 77‚Äì78 Geoffrey was known to be ambitious, which led the historian D. L. Douie to call him a \\"formidable bastard\\".Quoted in Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart p. 77 The historian Ralph Turner said of Geoffrey that \\"he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth\\" and that he had \\"inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets\\".Turner King and His Courts p. 84 Geoffrey was a patron of scholarship, and employed scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond.Cheney Hubert Walter pp. 164‚Äì165 Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter and wrote a legal work on canon law.Young Hubert Walter p. 57 The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed into the hands of Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.Morgan Survey of Manuscripts pp. 61‚Äì62 Notes Citations References    Further reading * * Geoffrey, Archbishop of York Geoffrey, Archbishop of York Category:12th-century English people Category:13th-century English people Category:12th-century English clergy Category:13th-century English clergy Category:12th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:13th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Archbishops of York Category:Archdeacons of Lincoln Category:Bishops of Lincoln Category:High Sheriffs of Yorkshire Category:House of Plantagenet Category:Lord Chancellors of England Category:Henry II of England Category:Illegitimate children of Henry II of England ","title":"Geoffrey (archbishop of York)"},{"id":"654549","text":"Omnicom Group Inc. is an American global media, marketing and corporate communications holding company, headquartered in New York City.

Photographed by Ansel Adams. Baptist Sunday School group in Amherstburg, Ontario, [ca. 1910]. A Sunday school is an educational institution, usually (but not always) Christian in character. Sunday school classes usually precede a Sunday church service and are used to provide catechesis to Christians, especially children and teenagers, and oftentimes adults as well. Churches of many Christian denominations have classrooms attached to the church used for this purpose. Many Sunday school classes operate on a set curriculum, with some teaching attendees a catechism. Members often receive certificates and awards for participation, as well as attendance. Due to the fact that Sunday school classes precede morning worship on the Lord's Day, many provide a light breakfast, such as doughnuts and coffee, except on days in which Holy Communion is being celebrated due to the fact that many Christian denominations encourage fasting before receiving the Eucharistic elements. Sunday schools were first set up in the 18th century in England to provide education to working children. William King started a Sunday school in 1751 in Dursley, Gloucestershire, and suggested that Robert Raikes start a similar one in Gloucester. Raikes was editor of the Gloucester Journal. He wrote an article in his journal, and as a result many clergymen supported schools, which aimed to teach the youngsters reading, writing, cyphering (doing arithmetic) and a knowledge of the Bible. In 1785, 250,000 English children were attending Sunday school. There were 5,000 in Manchester alone. By 1835, the Society for the Establishment and Promotion of Sunday Schools had distributed 91,915 spelling books, 24,232 New Testaments and 5,360 Bibles. The Sunday school movement was cross-denominational. Financed through subscription, large buildings were constructed that could host public lectures as well as providing classrooms. Adults would attend the same classes as the infants, as each was instructed in basic reading. In some towns, the Methodists withdrew from the large Sunday school and built their own. The Anglicans set up their own National schools that would act as Sunday schools and day schools. These schools were the precursors to a national system of education. The role of the Sunday schools changed with the Education Act 1870 which provided universal elementary education. In the 1920s they also promoted sports, and ran Sunday School Leagues. They became social centres hosting amateur dramatics and concert parties. By the 1960s, the term Sunday school could refer to the building and rarely to education classes. By the 1970s even the largest Sunday school had been demolished. The locution today chiefly refers to catechism classes for children and adults that occur prior to the start of a church service. In certain Christian traditions, in certain grades, for example the second grade or eighth grade, Sunday School classes may prepare youth to undergo a rite such as First Communion or Confirmation. The doctrine of Sunday Sabbatarianism held by many Christian denominations encourages practices such as Sunday School attendance as it teaches that the entirety of the Lord's Day should be devoted to God; as such many children and teenagers often return to church in the late afternoon for youth group before attending an evening service of worship. Development United Kingdom The first recorded Sunday school opened in 1751 in St Mary's Church, Nottingham. Hannah Ball made another early start, founding a school in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire,in 1769. However, the pioneer of Sunday schools is commonly said to be Robert Raikes, editor of the Gloucester Journal, who in 1781, after prompting from William King (who was running a Sunday School in Dursley), recognised the need of children living in the Gloucester slums; the need also to prevent them from taking up crime. He opened a school in the home of a Mrs Meredith, operating it on a Sunday - the only day that the boys and girls working in the factories could attend. Using the Bible as their textbook, the children learned to read and write.Towns, Elmer L., \\"History of Sunday School\\", Sunday School Encyclopedia, 1993 In 18th-century England, education was largely reserved for a weathly, male minority and was not compulsory. The wealthy educated their children privately at home, with hired governesses or tutors for younger children. The town-based middle class may have sent their sons to grammar schools, while daughters were left to learn what they could from their mothers or from their fathers' libraries. The children of factory workers and farm labourers received no formal education, and typically worked alongside their parents six days a week, sometimes for more than 13 hours a day. By 1785 over 250,000 children throughout England attended schools on Sundays. In 1784 many new schools opened, including the interdenominational Stockport Sunday School, which financed and constructed a school for 5,000 scholars in 1805. In the late-19th century this was accepted as being the largest in the world. By 1831 it was reported that attendance at Sunday schools had grown to 1.2 million. Robert Raikes's schools were seen as the precursors of the English state education system. The first Sunday school in London opened at Surrey Chapel under Rowland Hill. By 1831 1,250,000 children in Great Britain, or about 25 per cent of the eligible population, attended Sunday schools weekly. The schools provided basic lessons in literacy alongside religious instruction. In 1833, \\"for the unification and progress of the work of religious education among the young\\", the Unitarians founded their Sunday School Association, as \\"junior partner\\" to the British and Foreign Unitarian Association, with which it eventually set up offices at Essex Hall in Central London. The work of Sunday schools in the industrial cities was increasingly supplemented by \\"ragged schools\\" (charitable provision for the industrial poor), and eventually by publicly funded education under the terms of the Elementary Education Act 1870. Sunday schools continued alongside such increasing educational provision, and new forms also developed such as the Socialist Sunday Schools movement, which began in the United Kingdom in 1886 Ireland The earliest recorded Sunday school programme in Ireland goes back to 1777 when Roman Catholic priest Daniel Delany - later (1787) Bishop Daniel Delany of Kildare and Leighlin - started a school in Tullow, County Carlow.Matthew, Russell, ‚ÄúSketches in Irish Biography, No. 28, Dr. Daniel Delany‚Äù, The Irish Monthly, Volume 23, 1895. This was a very sophisticated system which involved timetables, lesson plans, streaming, and various teaching activities.Rev. Martin Brenan, Schools of Kildare and Leighlin, A.D. 1775 - 1835, M.H. Gill and Son, Ltd, Dublin, 1935. This system spread to other parishes in the diocese. By 1787 in Tullow alone there were 700 students, boys and girls, men and women, and 80 teachers. The primary intent of this Sunday School system was the teaching of the Catholic faith; the teaching of reading and writing became necessary to assist in this. With the coming of Catholic Emancipation in Ireland (1829) and the establishment of the National Schools system (1831), which meant that the Catholic faith could be taught in school, the Catholic Sunday School system became unnecessary. The Church of Ireland Sunday School Society was founded in 1809. The Sabbath School Society of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland was founded in 1862.John M Barkley, The Sabbath School Society for Ireland, 1862 - 1962 (Sabbath School Society for Ireland, 1961).

Sunday school at a Baptist church in Kentucky, US, 1946 The American Sunday school system was first begun by Samuel Slater in his textile mills in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in the 1790s. Notable 20th-century leaders in the American Sunday School movement include: Clarence Herbert Benson, Henrietta Mears, founder of Gospel Light, Dr. Gene A. Getz, Howard Hendricks, Lois E. LeBar, Lawrence O. Richards and Elmer Towns. Philanthropist Lewis Miller was the inventor of the \\"Akron Plan\\" for Sunday schools, a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, conceived with Methodist minister John Heyl Vincent and architect Jacob Snyder. John Heyl Vincent collaborating was Baptist layman B. F. Jacobs, who devised a system to encourage Sunday school work, and a committee was established to provide the International Uniform Lesson Curriculum, also known as the \\"Uniform Lesson Plan\\". By the 1800s 80% of all new members were introduced to the church through Sunday school.\\"Sunday School Movement\\", Dictionary of Christianity in America, InterVarsity Press, 1990, p 1147 In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the Uniform Lesson Plan, Miller and Vincent worked together again to found what is now the Chautauqua Institution on the shores of Chautauqua Lake, New York. Form Saddleback Church Children's Building in Lake Forest, California. In Evangelical churches, during worship service, children and young people receive an adapted education, in Sunday school, in a separate room. Jeanne Halgren Kilde, When Church Became Theatre: The Transformation of Evangelical Architecture and Worship in Nineteenth-century America, Oxford University Press, USA, 2005, p. 159, 170, 188 George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christian Education, Volume 3, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2015, p. 229 Historically, Sunday schools were held in the afternoons in various communities, and were often staffed by workers from varying denominations. Beginning in the United States in the early 1930s, and Canada in the 1940s, the transition was made to Sunday mornings. Sunday school often takes the form of a one-hour or longer Bible study which can occur before, during, or after a church service. While many Sunday schools are focused on providing instruction for children (especially those sessions occurring during service times), adult Sunday-school classes are also popular and widespread (see RCIA). In some traditions, the term \\"Sunday school\\" is too strongly associated with children, and alternate terms such as \\"Adult Electives\\" or \\"religious education\\" are used instead of \\"Adult Sunday school\\". Some churches only operate Sunday school for children concurrently with the adult worship service. In this case, there is typically no adult Sunday school. Publishers In Great Britain an agency was formed called the Religious Tract Society which helped provide literature for the Sunday School. In the United States the American Sunday School Union was formed (headquartered in Philadelphia) for the publication of literature. This group helped pioneer what became known as the International Sunday School Lessons. The Sunday School Times was another periodical they published for the use of Sunday schools. LifeWay Christian Resources, Herald and Banner Press, David C Cook, and Group Publishing are among the widely available published resources currently used in Sunday schools across the country. Teachers Sunday school teachers are usually lay people who are selected for their role in the church by a designated coordinator, board, or a committee. Normally, the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education. Some Sunday school teachers, however, do have a background in education as a result of their occupations. Some churches require Sunday school teachers and catechists to attend courses to ensure that they have a sufficient understanding of the faith and of the teaching process to educate others. Other churches allow volunteers to teach without training; a profession of faith and a desire to teach is all that is required in such cases. It is also not uncommon for Roman Catholic or Protestant pastors (church ministers) to teach such classes themselves. Some well-known public figures who teach, or have taught, Sunday school include astronaut Ron Garan, comedian Stephen Colbert, novelist John Grisham, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter.

He is best known for his work the Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani, a collection of 52 episodic stories of a rogue, Abu al- Fath al-Iskandari, as recounted by a narrator, 'Isa b. Hisham. His Arabic name translates into \\"The Wonder of the Age\\". Life Very little is known about Al-Hamadani‚Äôs early life and primary sources are very limited.

More is known about Al-Hamadani‚Äôs adult life. In 380/990, al-Hamadhani, then aged 22, left his native city and began travelling to the various centres of learning. At the time, scholarly travel was an accepted practice for young, educated Arabic men. His first stop was at Rayy, possibly to meet up with his former mentor, Ahmed Ibn Faris (ref: Prendergast gives the instructor‚Äôs name as Abdul Husian ibn Faris; See https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n17). There he came under the patronage of Dihkhuda Abu Aid Muhammad ibn Mansur al-Isma (d. 410/1019). He next travelled to Jurjan where he began writing maqamat and where his literary talents found a receptive audience.H√§meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002 , pp 20-21; Prendergast, W.J., The Maqamat Of Badi Al Zaman Al-hamadhani, (1915), 1973, pp 3-4, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n19 In 383/992, he travelled to Khorasan, Nishapur, then under Samanid rule, and an established centre of literature. His experience of Khorasan was mixed. He was robbed several times by highwaymen, losing all of his possessions. However, his literary output became more prolific. He was in competition with al- Khawrizmi and eventually fell out with him. In Nishapur, he achieved great fame and his reputation spread throughout the region.H√§meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002, pp 21-24; Prendergast, W.J., The Maqamat Of Badi Al Zaman al-Hamadhani, (1915), 1973, pp 5-6, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n19 After Nishapur was conquered by the Ghaznavids he departed the region and returned to his travels. On the road, he stopped at Sarakhs, Tus and Marw. Some early sources, such as the Persian scholar, ath-Thalibi, suggest that Al-Hamadani also visited Sijistan and Ghazna. However, very little is known of such travels and reliable evidence is thin, leading scholars to caution that, as al-Hamadani‚Äôs fame grew, such visits became the stuff of legend. Jaakko H√§meen-Anttila, Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002, pp 27-28 In 383/993, he stopped at Zaranj, where he was received at the court of the Saffarid ruler, Abu Ahmad Khalaf ibn Ahdmad. Al-Hamadani‚Äôs intentions were to eulogise the ruler, for which he was well rewarded.H√§meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002 , pp 28-29 His movements, following his sojourn in Zaranj, are obscure. He eventually settled in Bushanj, near Herat where he married into the Abu-‚ÄòAli Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Khushnami, a local noble family and spent his final years . His literary output declined during his period of residency at Herat.

He died at Herat, at the age of forty. He was renowned for a remarkable memory and for fluency of speech, as well as for the purity of his language. His letters were first published at Constantinople (1881), and with commentary at Beirut (1890); his maqamas at Constantinople, and with commentary at Beirut (1889). Selected letters have been published in works, such as Silvestre de Sacy's edition of six of the maqamas with French translation and notes in his Chrestomathie arabe, vol. iii. (2nd ed., Paris, 1827). A specimen of the translated letters can be found A. von Kremers Culturgeschichte des Orients, ii. 470 sqq (in German).

Each maqama is a complete story, but maqama are often presented in a collection with an overarching theme.

Other characters, often historical characters, are introduced in different stories. The anecdotes, presented in al-Hamadani‚Äôs maqamat played into a growing interest in the activities of Arabic low-life, especially beggars, tricksters and criminals.Prendergast, W.J., The Maqamat Of Badi Al Zaman Al-hamadhani, (1915), 1973, p. vii https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n9 The maqama follows a loose structure of seven parts, namely (1) Isnad, (2) general introduction, (3) link (4) episode (the core of the narrative), (5) recognition scene, (6) envoi and (7) finale. Jaakko H√§meen-Anttila, Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002, pp 45-50 Stylistically, maqama employ Saj', a highly polished and elaborate prose.

Born to a humble family in Normandy, he owed his advancement to royal favour. Although contemporary writers accused Longchamp's father of being the son of a peasant, he held land as a knight. Longchamp first served Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, but quickly transferred to the service of Richard I, Henry's heir. When Richard became king in 1189, Longchamp paid ¬£3,000 for the office of Chancellor, and was soon named to the see, or bishopric, of Ely and appointed legate by the pope. Longchamp governed England while Richard was on the Third Crusade, but his authority was challenged by Richard's brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile. Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused a great deal of hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages. Background and early life Longchamp's ancestors originated in the village of Longchamps, Normandy.Balfour \\"Origins of the Longchamp Family\\" Medieval Prosopography p. 78 Although it is known that he was born in Normandy,Spear \\"Norman Empire and the Secular Clergy\\" Journal of British Studies p. 6 the exact location is unknown, with it perhaps being near the Norman village of Argenton. His father, Hugh de Longchamp, also held land in England, as did many other Norman nobles after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Hugh Nonant‚Äîone of Longchamp's opponents‚Äîdeclared that the elder Longchamp was the son of a peasant, which seems unlikely, as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a knight's tenancy in Normandy.Turner \\"Longchamp, William de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The family was originally of humble background, but rose through service to King Henry II.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England pp. 352‚Äì353 The elder Longchamp also held land in Herefordshire in England, including the manor of Wilton near Ross in Wales.Balfour \\"Origins of the Longchamp Family\\" Medieval Prosopography p. 82 Hugh married a woman named Eve, a relative of the Lacy family. Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, the son of Roger de Lacy, exiled by King William II in 1095 for rebellion.Balfour \\"Origins of the Longchamp Family\\" Medieval Prosopography p. 84 Longchamp's sister, Richeut, married the castellan of Dover Castle. A second sister, Melisend, came to England with Longchamp, but otherwise is unknown. A sister is recorded as having married Stephen Devereux, but whether this is Melisend is unclear. Of Longchamp's brothers, Osbert remained a layman, and owed much of his advancement to William; Stephen served King Richard I on crusade; Henry, another layman, became a sheriff along with Osbert; and Robert became a monk. Two of Longchamp's brothers became abbots.Balfour \\"Origins of the Longchamp Family\\" Medieval Prosopography p. 91 Longchamp entered public life at the close of Henry II's reign, as an official for the King's illegitimate son Geoffrey. He soon left Geoffrey's service, and served in Henry II's chancery, or writing office, before he entered service with Henry's son Richard.Gillingham Richard I pp. 121‚Äì122 Richard, who was Duke of Aquitaine at the time, named Longchamp chancellor of the Duchy of Aquitaine.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 351 footnote 3 Longchamp first distinguished himself at the court of King Philip II of France in Paris in 1189, when he acted as Richard's envoy in a dispute with William Marshal, King Henry's envoy. By that time, Longchamp was already one of Richard's trusted advisors.Gillingham Richard I p. 98 Chancellor and Justiciar On Richard's accession to the throne of England in 1189 Longchamp became Chancellor of England.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 84 Longchamp paid 3,000 pounds (¬£) for the office of Chancellor. This was followed by an increase in the price of having chancery documents sealed with the Great Seal, necessary for their authentication, perhaps to help Longchamp recoup the cost of office. At the council held at Pipewell on 15 September 1189, the King raised Longchamp to the bishopric of Ely. Richard named three other bishops at the same time: Godfrey de Lucy to Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to London, and Hubert Walter to Salisbury.Gillingham Richard I p. 109 Longchamp was consecrated on 31 December 1189Fryde, et al.

Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king's name.Saul \\"Justiciar\\" Companion to Medieval England p. 154 Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshal as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp.West Justiciarship in England p. 68 As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary.Turner English Judiciary pp. 65‚Äì66 Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500 marks (¬£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.Gillingham Richard I p. 130 Longchamp granted the citizens of London the right to elect their own sheriffs, and to collect and remit their monetary levy of ¬£300 directly to the Exchequer, the treasury of England.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 70 On Longchamp's visits to his diocese he was accompanied by a large train of retainers and animals, which became notorious throughout the country as a sign of his extravagance.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 223 Under his legatine authority, the bishop held legatine councils of the church at Gloucester and Westminster in 1190. He also acted to restore authority in York, which had suffered a breakdown in order after the massacre of Jews in March 1190. Also in 1190, he sent an army against Rhys ap Gruffydd, a Welsh prince who was attempting to throw off the control of the marcher lords that surrounded Wales. alt=A paved road leading to an arched opening in a tall thick stone wall. Disputes with John Longchamp's relations with the English people were made more difficult because he was a native of Normandy, and often insensitive to English customs. The medieval writer William of Newburgh claimed that Longchamp was \\"an obscure foreigner of unproven ability and loyalty\\".Quoted in Gillingham Richard I p. 121 For example, it appears likely that Longchamp did not speak English, making his relations with his flock more difficult.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 488 The leading nobles complained that Longchamp marginalised the other officials Richard had appointed to serve with him, and that he brought in foreigners to fill offices. Although the first charge is mostly untrue, the second appears to have been valid, as Longchamp did install non-natives in judicial offices and as sheriffs. He also attempted to seize control of a number of English castles by granting their custody to relatives and dependents.Heiser \\"Castles, Constables, and Politics\\" Albion pp. 19‚Äì20 Throughout 1190, Longchamp's relations with Richard's younger brother John were difficult. This led to Longchamp besieging Lincoln Castle because the castellan would not surrender the castle and allow himself to be replaced by Longchamp's nominee. The castellan, Gerard de Camville, had sworn allegiance to John and stated he would no longer recognise the chancellor's authority. In response, John took the two castles of Tickhill and Northampton.Huscroft Ruling England p. 144 News of the dispute reached Richard, who sent Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, to England in late spring 1191, with orders to negotiate a peace between John and Longchamp.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England pp. 373‚Äì376 Eventually, Walter brokered a compromise between the two as a result of which Gerard was confirmed as castellan and John relinquished the castles. Longchamp also agreed to work to ensure John's succession to the throne in the event of Richard's death. Longchamp's legatine commission from the papacy expired in spring 1191, on the death of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in- law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp.Gillingham Richard I pp. 227‚Äì229 Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 233‚Äì236 An intense propaganda campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of the leaders of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour. Longchamp went to Dover in late 1191 to seek transport to the continent. During his escape, he was unable to answer the local people when they spoke to him in English. He attempted to leave England in various disguises, including a monk's habit and women's clothes. Hugh Nonant wrote that Longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute, which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore. Longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving England, on 29 October. Exile and return Longchamp went to the court of Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was holding King Richard captive at Trifels. The bishop arranged for Richard to be held at the imperial court and negotiated a payment plan for the ransom, 100,000 marks, under the terms of which the emperor agreed to release Richard once 70,000 marks had been paid and hostages for the payment of the rest had been received.Gillingham Richard I p. 239 When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France's offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive, Longchamp attended along with Walter of Coutances and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother. After further diplomatic wrangling, Richard was freed on 4 February 1194.Gillingham Richard I pp. 247‚Äì248 Richard rewarded Longchamp with the custody of Eye and an appointment as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire when the pair returned to England, but Longchamp soon became embroiled in a renewal of his disagreement with Archbishop Geoffrey of York.Gillingham Richard I p. 272 Richard left England in May 1194, and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent, never to return to England;Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta pp. 368‚Äì369 Longchamp returned to the Emperor's court in 1195. Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacyGillingham Richard I p. 290‚Äîalthough it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194‚Äîas well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England pp. 385‚Äì386 Longchamp spent the rest of his life outside his diocese, usually accompanying the king.Sharpe \\"Richard Barre's Compendium\\" Journal of Medieval Latin p. 134 Death and legacy Longchamp died in January 1197, at Poitiers, while on a diplomatic mission to Rome for Richard,Gillingham Richard I, p. 302, footnote 5 and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin. Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him, for example, Gerald of Wales called Longchamp that \\"monster with many heads\\".Quoted in Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England p. 353 The historian Austin Lane Poole says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape than a man. Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well-educated man. He was supported by others among his contemporaries, including Pope Clement III, who, when he appointed Longchamp legate, wrote that he did so at the urging of the English bishops.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 358 When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189, medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes wrote that the four new bishops were \\"men of no little virtue and fame\\".Quoted in Gillingham Richard I p. 109 Historian John Gillingham wrote that Longchamp's \\"record of his life in politics and administration was a good one, spoiled only by his failure in 1191\\". One of Longchamp's probable innovations as chancellor was the replacement of the first person singular previously used in documents drafted in the king's name with the majestic plural or \\"royal we\\". He wrote a work on law entitled Practica legum et decretorum, a manual on the usage of both civil and canon law in the Angevin possessions on the continent,Turner \\"Roman Law\\" Journal of British Studies p. 12 composed sometime between 1181 and 1189. It was well known in the Middle Ages, and served as a practical guide for those involved in litigation.Turner English Judiciary p. 230 The medieval poet Nigel Wireker (also known as Nigel de Longchamps) dedicated to the bishop a satirical poem, Speculum Stultorum (\\"Mirror of Fools\\"), on the habits of students.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 241 Richard Barre, a medieval writer and judge, dedicated his work Compendium de veteris et novo testamento to Longchamp.Turner English Judiciary p. 96 Longchamp was one of Barre's patrons, and secured the post of Archdeacon of Ely for him as well as judicial posts.Turner English Judiciary p. 104 Two writers have seen in the assembly that met to try Longchamp in 1191 a precursor to the gathering at Runnymede in 1215 that drew up Magna Carta, as it was one of the earliest examples of the nobles of the realm coming together to force the government to rule with their advice.Powell and Wallis The House of Lords p. 100 Longchamp also promoted the careers of his brothers; Henry and Osbert became sheriffs in the 1190s, Osbert the Sheriff of Yorkshire.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta pp. 352‚Äì353 His brother Robert, a cleric, also benefitted, becoming prior of the Ely cathedral chapter and later abbot of St Mary's Abbey, York.Knowles, et al.

April 23, 1894To gain a professional advantage, Borzage subtracted a year from his date of birth while still a teenager; many sources, including IMDb, thus give 1893 as his birthdate; Dumont, p. 32. ‚Äì June 19, 1962) was an Academy Award-winning American film director and actor, known for directing 7th Heaven (1927), Street Angel (1928), Bad Girl (1931), A Farewell to Arms (1932), Man's Castle (1933), History Is Made at Night (1937), The Mortal Storm (1940) and Moonrise (1948). Biography Frank Borzage's father, Luigi Borzaga, was born in Ronzone (then Austrian Empire, now Italy) in 1859. As a stonemason, he sometimes worked in Switzerland; he met his future wife, Maria Ruegg (1860, , Switzerland1947, Los Angeles), where she worked in a silk factory. Borzaga emigrated to Hazleton, Pennsylvania in the early 1880s where he worked as a coal miner. He brought his fianc√©e to the United States and they married in Hazleton in 1883. Their first child, Henry, was born in 1885. The Borzaga family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where Frank Borzage was born in 1894, and the family remained there until 1919. The couple had fourteen children, eight of whom survived childhood: Henry (1885‚Äì1971), Mary Emma (1886‚Äì1906), Bill (1892‚Äì1973), Frank, Daniel (1896‚Äì1975, a performer and member of the John Ford Stock Company), Lew (1898‚Äì1974), Dolly (1901‚Äì2002) and Sue (1905‚Äì1998). Luigi Borzaga died in Los Angeles in a car accident in 1934; his wife Maria (Frank's mother) died of cancer in 1947. In 1912, Frank Borzage found employment as an actor in Hollywood; he continued to work as an actor until 1917. His directorial debut came in 1915 with the film, The Pitch o' Chance. On June 7, 1916, Borzage married vaudeville and film actress Lorena \\"Rena\\" Rogers in Los Angeles and remained married until 1941. In 1945, he married Edna Stillwell Skelton, the ex-wife of comedian Red Skelton; they were divorced in 1949. Borzage died of cancer in 1962, aged 68, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. For his contributions to the film industry, Borzage received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star is located at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard. Career Borzage was a successful director throughout the 1920s; he reached his peak in the late silent and early sound era. Absorbing visual influences from the German director F.W. Murnau, who was also resident at Fox at this time, he developed his own style of lushly visual romanticism in a hugely successful series of films starring Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, including 7th Heaven (1927), for which he won the first Academy Award for Best Director, Street Angel (1928) and Lucky Star (1929). He won a second Oscar for 1931's Bad Girl. He directed 14 films between 1917 and 1919 alone; his greatest success in the silent era was with Humoresque (1920), a box office winner starring Vera Gordon. Borzage's trademark was intense identification with the feelings of young lovers in the face of adversity, with love in his films triumphing over such trials as World War I (7th Heaven and A Farewell to Arms), disability (Lucky Star), the Depression (Man's Castle), a thinly disguised version of the Titanic disaster in History Is Made at Night, and the rise of Nazism, a theme which Borzage had virtually to himself among Hollywood filmmakers from Little Man, What Now? (1933) to Three Comrades (1938) and The Mortal Storm (1940). His work took a spiritual turn in such films as Green Light (1937), Strange Cargo (1940) and The Big Fisherman (1959). Of his later work, only the film noir Moonrise (1948) has enjoyed much critical acclaim. After 1948, his output was sporadic. He was the original director of Journey Beneath the Desert (1961), but was too unwell to continue, and Edgar G. Ulmer took over. Borzage was uncredited for the sequences he did direct. In 1955 and 1957, Borzage was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

The county borough has a total population of 139,200 people, and contains the town of Bridgend, after which it is named. Its members of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) are Carwyn Jones MS, the former First Minister of Wales and Huw Irranca-Davies MS representing the Ogmore Constituency, and its members of UK parliament are Jamie Wallis and Chris Elmore. The county borough lies at the geographical heart of south Wales. Its land area of 110 sq. mi. (285 sq. km.) stretches 12 miles (20 km) from east to west and occupies the Llynfi, Garw and Ogmore valleys. The largest town is Bridgend (pop: 39,773), followed by Maesteg (pop: 20,700) and seaside resort of Porthcawl (pop: 19,238). It is situated on the Ogmore River and its tributaries, although the Ewenny and Ogwr Fach rivers form the border with the Vale of Glamorgan for much of their length. It was formed on 1 April 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994. It includes all of the former Ogwr borough apart from the communities of Wick, St Bride's Major and Ewenny, which went to Vale of Glamorgan. Bridgend County Borough was divided into 20 communities: Brackla, Bridgend, Cefn Cribwr, Coity Higher, Coychurch Higher, Coychurch Lower, Cornelly, Garw Valley, Laleston, Llangynwyd Lower, Llangynwyd Middle, Maesteg, Merthyr Mawr, Newcastle Higher, Ogmore Valley, Pencoed, Porthcawl, Pyle, St Bride's Minor and Ynysawdre. The communities of Brackla, Bridgend and Coychurch Lower make up the town of Bridgend. Government The region is governed by Bridgend County Borough Council, a Principal council. It is currently in the control of the Labour party with 39 seats out of 54. Schools Parks and green spaces Bryngarw Country Park is the largest (113 acres) country park in the borough. It offers many amenity based areas including an adventure play area, barbecue and picnic areas, car park, cafe, visitor centre and toilets; as well as a patchwork of woodland, grassland and freshwater habitats. Bryngarw Country Park is a Grade II listed Historic Park and Garden and has been designated a 'Green Flag' Park since 2010. The Oriental Garden in the park has been noted as a 'Visit Wales Sustainable Tourism, Historic Gardens Centre of Excellence‚Äô by the 'One Historic Garden, Centre of Excellence'. Kenfig National Nature Reserve with Glamorgan‚Äôs largest natural lake, Kenfig Pool, is set on the edge of this area, with views from Sker beach across Swansea Bay to Gower. It is one of the finest wildlife habitats in Wales, and one of the last remnants of a huge dune system that once stretched along the coast from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula. The reserve is home to unique wild orchids, as well as insects and wildlife. Kenfig is one of the most important sites in Britain for nature conservation. Parc Slip Nature Reserve is an environment of wetlands, woodlands and meadows at the Parc Slip Nature Park where there is a wealth of wildlife. After a century of coal mining on the site, the Wildlife Trust began to manage the land for nature in the late 1980s. Varied habitats have since been created and the park supports an increasing diversity of wildlife.

History After nearly two months of negotiations, representatives from Sweden and Russia met at the (now- derelict) village of Stolbovo south of Lake Ladoga in the modern Volkhovsky District. The meeting took place on . From the outset, Sweden had gone into the negotiations with very high ambitions, with hopes of fulfilling the old dream of making all of the Russian trade pass through Swedish territory. As a consequence of that ambition, the Swedes originally demanded far-reaching territorial gains into western Russia, including the important northern port of Arkhangelsk. At that point, however, King James I of England sent a delegation to mediate, and so did the Netherlands, mostly to make sure Arkhangelsk did not fall into Swedish hands, which would have made the extensive trade between Western Europe and Russia far more difficult. Arkhangelsk did not change hands in the resulting treaty, partly because of the Dutch and the English efforts, but mostly because Russia finally managed to unite under Tsar Michael I of Russia. As word reached Russia that the Swedish war against Poland might soon be over, the Russians were quick to get negotiations going for real since they knew that they could not afford Sweden's renewal of the war effort on just one front.Sundberg, Ulf (2002) Svenska freder och stillest√•nd 1249-1814 pg. 232‚Äì234 The Kingdom of England is officially credited with brokering this peace through its mediator, John Mericke (c.1559 ‚Äì 1638/9), but the Dutch efforts were also of great importance. After the war, the leader of the Dutch delegation, Reinoud van Brederode (1567‚Äì1633), was granted the title baron and given the barony of Wesenberg (Rakvere) in Estonia by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Terms In the resulting peace treaty, the Russian Tsar and Swedish King agreed to the following terms: * Sweden gained the province of Kexholm in Karelia and the province of Ingria -- including the fortress of N√∂teborg, (now Shlisselburg, Russia) * Russia renounced all claims to Estonia and Livonia and would pay Sweden war indemnities of 20,000 rubles * Novgorod and other Swedish territorial gains during the war would be returned to Russia * Sweden had the right to keep all spoils of war collected before 20 November 1616 * The city of Gdov was to remain in Swedish hands until the peace had been confirmed and the borders fully established * Sweden recognized Michael Romanov as the rightful Tsar of Russia, putting an end to further Swedish claims in the Russian throne * Russia was allowed free trade at normal trade tariffs, making sure Sweden could not cripple Russia completely * Russia was allowed to establish merchant houses in Stockholm, Reval (Tallinn) and Viborg; Sweden was allowed to establish merchant houses in Novgorod, Pskov, and Moscow.

It is governed by Caerphilly County Borough Council. Its main and largest town is Caerphilly. Other towns in the county borough are Bedwas, Risca, Ystrad Mynach, Newbridge, Blackwood, Bargoed, New Tredegar and Rhymney. Geography Caerphilly County Borough is in southeast Wales and straddles the border between the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. It is bordered by Cardiff to the southwest, Newport to the southeast, Torfaen to the east, Blaenau Gwent to the northeast, Powys to the north, Merthyr Tydfil to the northwest and Rhondda Cynon Taf to the west. The northern part of the borough is formed by the broad expanse of the Rhymney Valley. The Rhymney River rises in the hills in the north and flows southwards for about thirty miles, looping round to the east just to the north of Caerphilly before reaching the Bristol Channel. Some of the larger towns are Bedwas, Risca, Ystrad Mynach, Newbridge, Blackwood, Bargoed, New Tredegar and Rhymney. The valley also includes the communities of Abertysswg, Fochriw, Pontlottyn, Tir-Phil, Brithdir, New Tredegar, Aberbargoed, Rhymney and Ystrad Mynach, and the towns of Bargoed and Caerphilly. History Located on the edge of the South Wales Coalfield this area was sparsely populated with livestock husbandry being the main occupation. Farmers in their remote farmhouses on the windswept pastures might dig themselves some bucketfuls of coal for their hearth. Things began to change with the development of the iron industry, the start of the Industrial Revolution. In 1752, a 99-year lease was granted for a parcel of land in the Rhymney Valley which gave the lessees the right to mine coal and iron ore. Other such transactions followed, pitshafts were dug and the coal industry developed. By the beginning of the twentieth century, there were forty coalmines in the valley. One of the pits sunk in the late nineteenth century was the Elliot Colliery. At its peak before World War I, it was producing over a million tons of coal a year and employing nearly three thousand people. The coal eventually became depleted and the colliery closed in 1967. Most of the site was cleared but the East Winding House survives and is now a Grade II listed building, and a museum of the coal industry in the area has been opened on the site. All the pits in the valley were closed by the end of the twentieth century; the spoil heaps were removed and the area was landscaped so that it is not now apparent that the valley ever had an industrial past. The county borough was formed on 1 April 1996 by the merger of the Rhymney Valley district of Mid Glamorgan with the Islwyn borough of Gwent. In 2008, as a result of representations from different communities in the borough, a draft plan was put forward proposing various changes to the borders between communities.

The town, which faces Deganwy across the River Conwy, formerly lay in Gwynedd and prior to that in Caernarfonshire. The community, which includes Deganwy and Llandudno Junction, had a population of 14,208 at the 2001 census, and is a popular tourist destination. The population rose to 14,753 at the 2011 census. In the 2015 census \\"The size of the resident population in Conwy County Borough on the 30th June 2015 was estimated to be 116,200 people.\\" The town itself has a population of 4,065. The name 'Conwy' derives from the old Welsh words 'cyn' (chief) and 'gwy' (water), the river being originally called the 'Cynwy'.Llandudno: its history and natural history, 1861, Richard ParryA guide through North Wales, 1860, William Cathrall & Andrew Crombie RamsayTransactions, 1822, Cymmrodorion societyThe pedestrian's guide through North Wales, 1838, George John Bennett History \\"Castle and suspension bridge\\", ca. 1890 ‚Äì 1900. Castle and town walls A view of the original walled town, from one of the towers of alt= Conwy Castle and the town walls were built, on the instruction of Edward I of England, between 1283 and 1289, as part of his conquest of the principality of Wales. The church standing in Conwy has been marked as the oldest building in Conwy and has stood in the walls of Conwy since the 14th century. However, the oldest structure is part of the town walls, at the southern end of the east side. Here one wall and the tower of a Llys [palace/court house] belonging to Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffydd have been incorporated into the wall. Built on a rocky outcrop, with an apsidal tower, it is a classic, native, Welsh build and stands out from the rest of the town walls, due to the presence of four window openings. It dates from the early 13th century and is the most complete remnant of any of his Llys. People born within the town walls of Conwy in north Wales are nicknamed \\"Jackdaws\\", after the jackdaws which live on the walls there. A Jackdaw Society existed until 2011. The population of the town in 1841 was 1,358.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III, (1847) London, Charles Knight, p.1,018 Abbey Conwy was the original site of Aberconwy Abbey, founded by Llywelyn the Great. Edward and his troops took over the abbey site and moved the monks down the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan, establishing Maenan Abbey. The parish church still retains some parts of the original abbey church in the east and west walls. English settlers were given incentives to move to the walled garrison town, which for decades the Welsh were forbidden from entering. Suspension bridge Conwy has other tourist attractions that help draw visitors to the town. Conwy Suspension Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford to replace the ferry, was completed in 1826 and spans the River Conwy next to the castle. Telford designed the bridge's supporting towers to match the castle's turrets. The bridge is now open to pedestrians only and, together with the toll-keeper's house, is in the care of the National Trust. Railway bridge The Conwy Railway Bridge, a Tubular bridge, was built for the Chester and Holyhead Railway by Robert Stephenson. The first tube was completed in 1848, the second in 1849. The bridge is still in use on the North Wales Coast Line, along with the station, which is located within the town walls. In addition to a modern bridge serving the town, the A55 road passes under the river by a tunnel, Britain's first immersed tube tunnel, which was built between 1986 and 1991. The old mountain road to Dwygyfylchi and Penmaenmawr runs through the Sychnant Pass, at the foot of Conwy Mountain. Aberconwy House The National Trust owns Aberconwy House, which is Conwy's only surviving 14th-century merchant's house, one of the first buildings built inside the walls of Conwy.  Plas Mawr  Plas Mawr is an Elizabethan house built in 1576 by the Wynn family, which has been extensively refurbished to its 16th-century appearance and is now in the care of Cadw and open to the public. Plas Mawr Smallest house in Great Britain The smallest house in Britain. The house named in the Guinness Book of Records as The Smallest House in Great Britain, with dimensions of 3.05 metres x 1.8 metres, can be found on the quay. It was in continuous occupation from the 16th century (and was even inhabited by a family at one point) until 1900 when the owner (a fisherman ‚Äì Robert Jones) was forced to move out on the grounds of hygiene. The rooms were too small for him to stand up in fully. The house is still owned by his descendants today, and you can go on a tour around it for a small charge.  Vardre Hall  Vardre Hall is a 19th Century Grade II listed building set directly opposite to Conwy Castle. It was erected by Conservative Buckinghamshire MP William Edward FitzMaurice in the mid 1850s. In 1869 the building was sold to solicitor William Jones. The building was used as a solicitor's office until 1972, when it was bought out and became The Towers Restaurant. The Towers Coffee house remains next door. After laying empty for a number of years Vardre Hall changed hands again and, in 1999, was refurbished into a shop. Medieval watchtower Across the estuary is Bodysgallen Hall, which incorporates a medieval tower that was possibly built as a watch tower for Conwy Castle. Notable locations Conwy Morfa, a marshy spit of land on the west side of the estuary, was probably the location where golf was first played on Welsh soil. It was also the place where Hugh Iorys Hughes developed, and later built, the floating Mulberry Harbour, used in Operation Overlord in World War II. Conwy Hospital closed in 2003 and has since been demolished. Conwy railway station bus stop has services to Llandudno and a hop on, hop off tour bus, The Llandudno and Conwy Tour. Lifeboat A lifeboat station was established by the RNLI in 1966 and currently operates the D-class inshore lifeboat The May Bob. Governance A Conwy electoral ward exists for elections to Conwy County Borough Council. The ward extends west of the River Conwy only with a total population of 4,065. The other county wards within the Conwy community are Deganwy, Marl and Pensarn. Conwy also has a town council, comprising 17 town councillors elected from the five community wards of Aberconwy, Castle, Deganwy, Marl and Pensarn.

The Centre houses a 50-metre swimming pool with an associated diving pool, an aquapark and leisure pool, and a fitness centre. Since opening in March 2003, the centre has hosted the swimming events of the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games, the 2003 European Short Course Swimming Championships and a number of international water polo events. It also hosts the Irish Open Swimming Championships, Irish Senior Water Polo Cup, Irish Open Diving Championships, as well as a number of other national and regional aquatic events. History In 2001, a \\"Design, Build and Operate\\" contract for the centre was awarded to a consortium of companies ‚Äì S & P Architects (for the design part), Rohcon (construction) and Dublin Waterworld (operation). The capital cost of the centre was originally budgeted at ‚Ç¨62.5 million. The project was certified as complete in September 2010. The actual cost of the project is still unclear but ‚Ç¨119m has been spent on the Campus to date. The Centre sustained roof damage during a period of stormy weather in January 2005 and had to be closed for five months so that repairs could be carried out. This closure, after only 18 months operation, damaged the business of the operating company, Dublin Waterworld. Campus & Stadium Ireland Development (CSID), the State company which owns the centre, commissioned an engineer to assess the roof damage and they concluded that the roof was not designed and constructed in accordance with building regulations, despite the fact that CSID's experts had certified it. During the period of closure, the NSCDA (National Sports Campus Development Authority) commenced legal proceedings to remove the operators. The case was settled in December 2006 with Dublin Waterworld agreeing to leave the centre and each party covering their own costs. NSCDA claimed that the former Operator Dublin Waterworld Limited had failed to pay VAT of some ‚Ç¨10m. A High Court-appointed arbitrator upheld the VAT charge as did the High Court. However, in 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that there was no basis for the VAT charge and set aside both the earlier awards. The Public Accounts Committee investigated the background to the case and issued a report in May 2012, which was highly critical of NSCDA and the Department of Sport. In December 2012, Dublin Waterworld acquired documents that demonstrated that NSCDA had been advised in 2002 that the VAT charge was contrary to legislation. These documents were forwarded to the Public Accounts Committee, and an explanation from NSCDA sought. Since the NSCDA took back the running of the centre in 2007 the centre has seen visitor numbers multiply, and membership triple. However the centre still requires an annual multimillion-euro subsidy. The Centre claimed to have had over six hundred thousand visitors in 2011, with admission income of ‚Ç¨1.4m and ticket costs of up to ‚Ç¨14. In 2012 over 815,000 people used the facilities of the centre, making it Ireland's third most popular fee-paying attraction. Swim Ireland launched a High Performance Unit in April 2010 and conducts training camps for elite swimmers at the centre. In 2012, the NAC hosted pre- Olympic training camps for teams from 16 different countries, including the then Water Polo Champions Hungary, new Olympic Water Polo Champions Croatia, the Korean National Swimming team and the Synchronised Swimming team from the US, among others. The NAC has come to house Ireland's biggest one-site programme of swimming lessons (over 2,500 participants weekly) and has over 4,500 members. On 7 January 2013 the centre set an Irish record for the most bookings in one day for swimming, diving and synchronised swimming lessons. Facilities The National Aquatic Centre is one of the world's largest indoor water centres. It comprises: * a 10-lane 50 metre x 25 metre international standard swimming pool with two moveable floors which allow it to be reconfigured for other uses; * a 25-metre international standard diving and warm-up pool; * seating for 2,500 spectators; * a leisure area (AquaZone) including adventure water rides, with a children's play pool and wave pool, and a \\"lazy river\\" feature; * a fitness centre (ToneZone); * a caf√©. The centre is fully accessible and was commended in 6 O2 Kanchi Award categories as well as winning ILAM Gold Standard awards twice. In November 2012 the centre won the Fingal Business Chamber Award for \\"Best Sales & marketing\\". This added to the Dublin 15 Chamber Awards won in 2009 & 2010\\\\. Olympic sized swimming pool The National Aquatic Centre houses Ireland's first Olympic standard pool. Known as the International Competition Pool, in 2003 it was used for the 2003 Special Olympics and later in the same year hosted the Ligue europ√©enne de natation. In 2012 this pool hosted 16 nations from across the globe, including teams from USA, Great Britain, South Korea, Canada, Croatia and more for pre London Olympics Games training camps, making it Ireland's most successful pre-Olympics venue.

LLVM is designed around a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) that serves as a portable, high-level assembly language that can be optimized with a variety of transformations over multiple passes. LLVM is written in C++ and is designed for compile-time, link-time, run-time, and \\"idle-time\\" optimization. Originally implemented for C and C++, the language-agnostic design of LLVM has since spawned a wide variety of front ends: languages with compilers that use LLVM include ActionScript, Ada, C#, Common Lisp, Crystal, CUDA, D, Delphi, Dylan, Fortran, Graphical G Programming Language, Halide, Haskell, Java bytecode, Julia, Kotlin, Lua, Objective-C, OpenCL, PostgreSQL's SQL and PLpgSQL,https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/jit-reason.html Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, and Xojo. History The LLVM project started in 2000 at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, under the direction of Vikram Adve and Chris Lattner. LLVM was originally developed as a research infrastructure to investigate dynamic compilation techniques for static and dynamic programming languages. LLVM was released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, a permissive free software licence. In 2005, Apple Inc. hired Lattner and formed a team to work on the LLVM system for various uses within Apple's development systems. LLVM is an integral part of Apple's latest development tools for macOS and iOS. The name LLVM was originally an initialism for Low Level Virtual Machine. This abbreviation has officially been removed to avoid confusion, as LLVM has evolved into an umbrella project that has little relationship to what most current developers think of as virtual machines. Now, LLVM is a brand that applies to the LLVM umbrella project, the LLVM intermediate representation (IR), the LLVM debugger, the LLVM implementation of the C++ Standard Library (with full support of C++11 and C++14), etc. LLVM is administered by the LLVM Foundation. Its president is compiler engineer Tanya Lattner. \\"For designing and implementing LLVM\\", the Association for Computing Machinery presented Vikram Adve, Chris Lattner, and Evan Cheng with the 2012 ACM Software System Award. Since v9.0.0, it was relicensed to the Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. Features LLVM can provide the middle layers of a complete compiler system, taking intermediate representation (IR) code from a compiler and emitting an optimized IR. This new IR can then be converted and linked into machine- dependent assembly language code for a target platform. LLVM can accept the IR from the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) toolchain, allowing it to be used with a wide array of extant compilers written for that project. LLVM can also generate relocatable machine code at compile-time or link-time or even binary machine code at run-time. LLVM supports a language-independent instruction set and type system. Each instruction is in static single assignment form (SSA), meaning that each variable (called a typed register) is assigned once and then frozen. This helps simplify the analysis of dependencies among variables. LLVM allows code to be compiled statically, as it is under the traditional GCC system, or left for late-compiling from the IR to machine code via just-in- time compilation (JIT), similar to Java. The type system consists of basic types such as integer or floating point numbers and five derived types: pointers, arrays, vectors, structures, and functions. A type construct in a concrete language can be represented by combining these basic types in LLVM. For example, a class in C++ can be represented by a mix of structures, functions and arrays of function pointers. The LLVM JIT compiler can optimize unneeded static branches out of a program at runtime, and thus is useful for partial evaluation in cases where a program has many options, most of which can easily be determined unneeded in a specific environment. This feature is used in the OpenGL pipeline of Mac OS X Leopard (v10.5) to provide support for missing hardware features. Graphics code within the OpenGL stack can be left in intermediate representation, and then compiled when run on the target machine. On systems with high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), the resulting code remains quite thin, passing the instructions on to the GPU with minimal changes. On systems with low-end GPUs, LLVM will compile optional procedures that run on the local central processing unit (CPU) that emulate instructions that the GPU cannot run internally. LLVM improved performance on low-end machines using Intel GMA chipsets. A similar system was developed under the Gallium3D LLVMpipe, and incorporated into the GNOME shell to allow it to run without a proper 3D hardware driver loaded.Michael Larabel, \\"GNOME Shell Works Without GPU Driver Support\\", phoronix, November 6, 2011 For run- time performance of the compiled programs, GCC formerly outperformed LLVM by 10% on average in 2011. Newer results in 2013 indicate that LLVM has now caught up with GCC in this area, and is now compiling binaries of approximately equal performance. Components LLVM has become an umbrella project containing multiple components. Front ends LLVM was originally written to be a replacement for the existing code generator in the GCC stack, and many of the GCC front ends have been modified to work with it, resulting in the now-defunct llvm-gcc suite. The modifications generally involve a GIMPLE-to-LLVM IR step so that LLVM optimizers and codegen can be used instead of GCC's GIMPLE system. Apple has historically been an important user of llvm- gcc.. This (use of GCC frontend) was considered mostly a temporary measure, but with the advent of clang and advantages of LLVM and clang's modern and modular codebase (as well as compilation speed), is mostly obsolete. LLVM currently supports compiling of Ada, C, C++, D, Delphi, Fortran, Haskell, Julia, Objective-C, Rust, and Swift using various front ends. Widespread interest in LLVM has led to several efforts to develop new front ends for a variety of languages. The one that has received the most attention is Clang, a new compiler supporting C, C++, and Objective-C. Primarily supported by Apple, Clang is aimed at replacing the C/Objective-C compiler in the GCC system with a system that is more easily integrated with integrated development environments (IDEs) and has wider support for multithreading. Support for OpenMP directives has been included in Clang since release 3.8. The Utrecht Haskell compiler can generate code for LLVM. Though the generator is in the early stages of development, in many cases it has been more efficient than the C code generator. There is a Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) backend using LLVM that achieves a 30% speed-up of the compiled code relative to native code compiling via GHC or C code generation followed by compiling, missing only one of the many optimizing techniques implemented by the GHC. Many other components are in various stages of development, including, but not limited to, the Rust compiler, a Java bytecode front end, a Common Intermediate Language (CIL) front end, the MacRuby implementation of Ruby 1.9, various front ends for Standard ML, and a new graph coloring register allocator. Intermediate representation LLVM IR is used e.g., by radeonsi and by llvmpipe. Both are part of Mesa 3D. The core of LLVM is the intermediate representation (IR), a low-level programming language similar to assembly. IR is a strongly typed reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set which abstracts away most details of the target. For example, the calling convention is abstracted through call and ret instructions with explicit arguments. Also, instead of a fixed set of registers, IR uses an infinite set of temporaries of the form %0, %1, etc. LLVM supports three equivalent forms of IR: a human-readable assembly format, an in-memory format suitable for frontends, and a dense bitcode format for serializing. A simple \\"Hello, world!\\" program in the IR format:For the full documentation, refer to . @.str = internal constant [14 x i8] c\\"hello, world\\\\0A\\\\00\\" declare i32 @printf(i8*, ...) define i32 @main(i32 %argc, i8** %argv) nounwind { entry: %tmp1 = getelementptr [14 x i8], [14 x i8]* @.str, i32 0, i32 0 %tmp2 = call i32 (i8*, ...) @printf( i8* %tmp1 ) nounwind ret i32 0 } The many different conventions used and features provided by different targets mean that LLVM cannot truly produce a target-independent IR and retarget it without breaking some established rules. Examples of target dependence beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the documentation can be found in a 2011 proposal for \\"wordcode\\", a fully target-independent variant of LLVM IR intended for online distribution. A more practical example is PNaCl. Back ends At version 3.4, LLVM supports many instruction sets, including ARM, Qualcomm Hexagon, MIPS, Nvidia Parallel Thread Execution (PTX; called NVPTX in LLVM documentation), PowerPC, AMD TeraScale, AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN), SPARC, z/Architecture (called SystemZ in LLVM documentation), x86, x86-64, and XCore. Some features are not available on some platforms. Most features are present for x86, x86-64, z/Architecture, ARM, and PowerPC.Target-specific Implementation Notes: Target Feature Matrix // The LLVM Target-Independent Code Generator, LLVM site. RISC-V is supported as of version 7. In the past LLVM also supported fully or partially other backends, including C backend, Cell SPU, mblaze (MicroBlaze), AMD R600, DEC/Compaq Alpha (Alpha AXP) and Nios2, but most of this hardware is mostly obsolete, and the LLVM support and maintenance for it couldn't be justified. LLVM also supports WebAssembly as a target, which allows to compile programs and execute them in WebAssembly environment like Google Chrome / Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari or WAVM. WebAssembly support allows to use mostly unmodified C, C++, D, Rust, Nim, Kotlin and possibly other third-party LLVM-based languages source codes, programs and libraries and target them into WebAssembly. The LLVM machine code (MC) subproject is LLVM's framework for translating machine instructions between textual forms and machine code. Formerly, LLVM relied on the system assembler, or one provided by a toolchain, to translate assembly into machine code. LLVM MC's integrated assembler supports most LLVM targets, including x86, x86-64, ARM, and ARM64. For some targets, including the various MIPS instruction sets, integrated assembly support is usable but still in the beta stage. Linker The lld subproject is an attempt to develop a built- in, platform-independent linker for LLVM. lld aims to remove dependence on a third-party linker. , lld supports ELF, PE/COFF, Mach-O, and WebAssembly in descending order of completeness. lld is faster than both flavors of GNU ld. Unlike the GNU linkers, lld has built-in support for link-time optimization. This allows for faster code generation as it bypasses the use of a linker plugin, but on the other hand prohibits interoperability with other flavors of LTO. C++ Standard Library The LLVM project includes an implementation of the C++ Standard Library called libc++, dual-licensed under the MIT License and the UIUC license. Since v9.0.0, it was relicensed to the Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. Polly This implements a suite of cache- locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model. Debugger  Derivatives  Due to its permissive license, many vendors release their own tuned forks of LLVM. This is officially recognized by LLVM's documentation, which suggests against using version numbers in feature checks for this reason. Some of the vendors include: * AMD's AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler is based on LLVM, Clang, and Flang. * Apple maintains an open-source fork for Xcode. * ARM maintains a fork of LLVM 9 as the \\"Arm Compiler\\". * The Los Alamos National Laboratory has a parallel-computing fork of LLVM 8 called \\"Kitsune\\". * Since 2013, Sony has been using LLVM's primary front end Clang compiler in the software development kit (SDK) of its PlayStation 4 console.

This 1921 Soviet recruitment-poster for military education featured the Ukrainization theme. The text reads: \\"Son! Enroll in the school of Red commanders, and the defence of Soviet Ukraine will be ensured.\\" The poster uses traditional Ukrainian imagery and Ukrainian-language text. The Soviets organized the School of Red Commanders in Kharkiv to promote the careers of the Ukrainian national cadre in the Red Army. Korenizatsiya (, , \\"putting down roots\\") was an early policy of the Soviet Union for the integration of non- Russian nationalities into the governments of their specific soviet republics. In the 1920s the policy of korenization (nativization) promoted representatives of the titular nation, and their national minorities, into the lower administrative-levels of the local government, bureaucracy, and nomenklatura of their Soviet republics. In Russian, the term derives from (, \\"native population\\", or literally \\"root population\\"). Politically and culturally, the nativization policy aimed to eliminate Russian domination and culture in the said soviet republics. The de-Russification was forced even on ethnic Russians and their children. For example, all children in Ukraine were forced to learn the Russian language. The policies of korenization facilitated the Communist Party's establishment of the local languages in government and education, in publishing, in culture, and in public life. In that manner, the cadre of the local Communist Party were promoted to every level of government, and ethnic Russians working in said governments were required to learn the local language and culture of the given Soviet republic.  Beginnings  The nationalities policyNationalities policy went through several stages. For a general timeline, see the Russian-language Wikipedia article on \\"Nationalities policy of Russia\\" (:ru:–ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏) For a substantive analysis, see Slezkine (1994). The korenizatsiya phase roughly spanned the period from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s, though vestiges of it carried over. was formulated by the Bolshevik party in 1913, four years before they came to power in Russia. Vladimir Lenin sent a young Joseph Stalin (himself a Georgian and therefore an ethnic minority member) to Vienna, which was a very ethnically diverse city due to its status as capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Stalin reported back to Moscow with his ideas for the policy. It was summarized in Stalin's pamphlet (his first scholarly publication), Marxism and the National Question (1913).A copy can be found here: http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm. Ironically Stalin would also be the major proponent of its eventual dismemberment and the reemergence of Russification. Faced with the massive non-Russian opposition to his regime, Lenin in late 1919 convinced his associates their government had to stop the cultural administrative and linguistic policies it was following in the non-Russian republics. As adopted in 1923 korenizatziya involved teaching and administration in the language of the republic; and promoting non-Russians to positions of power in Republic administrations and the party, including for a time the creation of a special group of soviets called \\"natssoviety\\" (nationality councils) in their own \\"natsraiony\\" (nationality regions) based on concentrations of minorities within what were minority republics.For further discussion, see Yuri Slezkine, \\"The USSR as a Communal Apartment, Or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism,\\" Slavic Review 53, No. 2 (Summer 1994): 414-452. For example, in Ukraine in the late 1920s there were even natssoviety for Russians and Estonians. This policy was meant to partially reverse decades of Russification, or promotion of Russian identity culture and language in non-Russian territories that had taken place during the imperial period. It won over many previously anti-bolshevik non- Russians throughout the country. It also provoked hostility among some Russians and Russified non-Russians in non-Russian republics. In 1920s, the society was still not \\"Socialist\\". There was animosity towards the Russians and towards other nationalities on the part of the Russians, but there were also conflicts and rivalries among other nationalities.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, p. 79.  Against Great-Russian chauvinism  In 1923 at the 12th Party Congress, Stalin identified two threats to the success of the party's \\"nationalities policy\\": Great Power Chauvinism (Russian chauvinism) and local nationalism.See \\"National Factors in Party and State Affairs -- Theses for the Twelfth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Approved by the Central Committee of the Party,\\" available here: http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/NF23.html. However, he described the former as the greater danger: > [The] Great-Russian chauvinist spirit, which is becoming stronger and > stronger owing to the N.E.P., . . . [finds] expression in an arrogantly > disdainful and heartlessly bureaucratic attitude on the part of Russian > Soviet officials towards the needs and requirements of the national > republics. The multi-national Soviet state can become really durable, and > the co-operation of the peoples within it really fraternal, only if these > survivals are vigorously and irrevocably eradicated from the practice of our > state institutions. Hence, the first immediate task of our Party is > vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism. > The main danger, Great-Russian chauvinism, should be kept in check by the > Russians themselves, for the sake of the larger goal of building socialism. > Within the (minority) nationality areas new institutions should be organized > giving the state a national (minority) character everywhere, built on the > use of the nationality languages in government and education, and on the > recruitment and promotion of leaders from the ranks of minority groups. On > the central level the nationalities should be represented in the Soviet of > Nationalities.  Creation of socialist nations  The main idea of the Korenizacija was to grow communist cadres for every nationality. By the mid-1930s the percentage of locals in both the party and state service grew considerably.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, p. 80. The initial period of korenizacija went together with the development of national-territorial administrative units and national cultures. The latter was reflected above all in the areas of language constructionFor a highly informative yet compact summary see Slezkine (1994). and education.For a review of the national languages in education, see Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, \\"Equality, Efficiency, and Politics in Soviet Bilingual Education Policy: 1934-1980,\\" American Political Science Review 78 (December 1984): 1019-1039. For several of the small nationalities in Russia that had no literary language, a \\"Committee of the North\\"Committee for the Assistance to the Peoples of the Northern Borderlands. helped to create alphabets so that the national languages could be taught in schools and literacy could be brought to the people in their native languages ‚Äî and the minorities would thereby be brought from backwardness to the modern world.Juri Slezkine, Arctic Mirrors: Russia and the Small Peoples of the North (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994) (). And in the very large Ukrainian Republic, the program of Ukrainianization led to a profound shift of the language of instruction in schools to Ukrainian. In 1930, Stalin proclaimed at the 16th Party Congress that building socialism was a period of blossoming of national cultures. The final goal would be to merge into one international culture with a common language. Meanwhile, the first Five-Year Plan in 1928‚Äì1931 was a period of radicalism, utopianism and violence in an atmosphere of \\"cultural revolution\\" . Russian cultural heritage was under attack, churches were closed, old specialists were dismissed, and science and art were proletarianized.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, p. 81. The Bolsheviks' tactics in their struggle to neutralise nationalist aspirations led to political results by the beginning of the 1930s. The old structure of the Russian Empire had been destroyed and a hierarchical federal state structure, based on the national principle, was created. The structure was nationality- based states in which nationality cultures were blossoming, and nationality languages were spoken and used at schools and in local administration.It's important to be aware of a terminological distinction. In the context of Soviet nationalities policy the term \\"national,\\" which for clarity here has been rendered as \\"nationality,\\" referred to ethnic minorities and minority territories, as opposed to central or all-Soviet institutions. In this sense, for example, when educational policy focused on expanding \\"national schools\\" (nacional'nje ≈°kolu -- –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —à–∫–æ–ª—É), it focused on schools in the traditional languages of the national minorities (Ukrainian, Tatar, Armenian, Karelian, and so forth), not on schools for the Soviet Union as a whole. The transition was real, not merely a centralized Russian empire camouflaged.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, pp. 81‚Äì82. The 17th Party congress in 1934, proclaimed that the building of the material basis for a socialist society had succeeded. The Soviet Union first became an officially socialist society in 1936 when the new constitution was adopted. The new constitution stated that the many socialist nations had transformed on a voluntary basis into a harmonious union. According to the new constitution there were 11 socialist republics, 22 autonomous republics, nine autonomous regions and nine national territories. At the same time, administration was now greatly centralised. All the Republics were now harnessed to serve one common socialist state.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, p. 83. End of korenization  Purges of national cadre  Between 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiya was not actually repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges of the leaderships of the national republics and territories. The charge against non-Russians was that they had instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937 it was proclaimed that local elites had become hired agents and their goal had become dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism. Now it was time to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National leaderships of the republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, p. 84.  Reversal to Russification  By the mid-1930s, with purges in some of the national areas, the policy of korenizatsiya took a new turn, and by the end of the 1930s the policy of promoting local languages began to be balanced by greater Russianization, though perhaps not overt Russification or attempts to assimilate the minorities.This distinction can be attributed to Vernon Aspaturian: Russianization is the spread of Russian language and Russian culture (and, one might add, of Russian people) into non-Russian territories and societies; Russification is the psychological transformation of the self-identities of non-Russians into Russians. See Vernon V. Aspaturian, \\"The Non-Russian Peoples,\\" in Allen Kassof, Ed., Prospects for Soviet Society (New York: Praeger, 1968): 143-198. While Russianization may be a factor that fosters Russification, it is not sufficient by itself to produce it and in some circumstances may even have the opposite effect. By this time, non-Russians found their appetite whetted rather than satiated by korenizatsiya and there was indication it was encouraging inter-ethnic violence to the extent that the territorial integrity of the USSR would be in danger. In addition, ethnic Russians resented the institutionalized and artificial \\"reverse discrimination\\" that benefited non-Russians and regarded them as ungrateful and manipulative as a result. Another concern was that the Soviet's westernmost minorities - Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, Finns etc - who had been previously treated with conscious benevolence in order to provide propaganda value to members of their ethnic groups in nations bordering the USSR (and thus facilitating future national unification, which would then bring about territorial expansion of the USSR) were now instead increasingly seen a vulnerable to influence from across the border, \\"fifth columns\\" for expansionist states seeking to acquire Soviet territory inhabited by their own ethnic group.Martin, Terry Dean. The affirmative action empire: nations and nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939. Cornell University Press, 2001. The adherence of the masses to national rather than class identity was as strong in Russia as in other republics and regions. Between 1937 and 1953, racial policies began to creep into nationality policies, with certain nationalities seen as having immutable traits, particularly nationalities in the unstable borderlands.Law, Ian. Red racisms: racism in communist and post- communist contexts. Springer, 2016, p.19 Moreover, Stalin seemed set on greatly reducing the number of officially recognized nationalities by contracting the official list of nationalities in the 1939 census, compared with the 1926 census.This, however, would be mainly a change on paper, not in actual ethnic or national identities. The sharply contracted list in 1939 was later expanded again for the 1959 census, though not to the number of peoples listed in 1926; the director of the 1959 census criticized the earlier effort at contraction as artificial. The development of so-called \\"national schools\\" (–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —à–∫–æ–ª—ã) in which the languages of minority nationalities were the main media of instruction continued, spreading literacy and universal education in many national minority languages, while teaching Russian as a required subject of study. The term korenizatsiya went out of use in the latter half of the 1930s, replaced by more bureaucratic expressions, such as \\"selection and placement of national cadres\\" (–ø–æ–¥–±–æ—Ä –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∞ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–∞–¥—Ä–æ–≤). From 1937 the central press started to praise Russian language and Russian culture. Mass campaigns were organized to denounce the \\"enemies of the people\\". \\"Bourgeois nationalists\\" were new enemies of the Russian people which had suppressed the Russian language. The policy of indigenization was abandoned. In the following years the Russian language became a compulsory subject in all Soviet schools.Timo Vihavainen: Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments? in Chulos & Piirainen 2000, p. 85. The pre-revolution Russian nationalism was also rehabilitated. Many of the heroes of Russian history were re-appropriated for glorification. The Russian people became the \\"elder brother\\" of the \\"Socialist family of nations\\". A new kind of patriotism, Soviet patriotism, was declared to mean a willingness to fight for the Socialist fatherland. In 1938 Russian became a mandatory subject of study in all non-Russian schools. In general the cultural and linguistic russification reflected the overall centralization imposed by Stalin. The Cyrillic script was instituted for a number of Soviet languages, including the languages of Central Asia that in the late 1920s had been given Latin alphabets to replace Arabic ones.Armenian and Georgian kept their original and unique scripts. Many so-called \\"scriptless\\" languages, mainly of smaller nationalities in Russia, were first given scripts in Latin alphabet and later changed to Cyrillic. Other languages, in particular in Central Asia, Azerbaijan, and the North Caucasus, first adopted Latin scripts to replace Arabic scripts, and later adopted Cyrillic scripts to replace Latin scripts. Thus, the move to the Cyrillic alphabet was delayed for most non-Russian nationalities until at least the late 1930s, and full implementation of this change took time.

A taiaha () is a traditional weapon of the MƒÅori of New Zealand; a close-quarters staff weapon made from either wood or whalebone, and used for short, sharp strikes or stabbing thrusts with efficient footwork on the part of the wielder. Taiaha are usually between in length. It has three main parts; the arero (tongue), used for stabbing the opponent and parrying; the upoko (head), the base from which the tongue protrudes; and the ate (liver) or tinana (body), the long flat blade which is also used for striking and parrying. Portrait of Te Rangi Hƒ´roa (Peter Henry Buck) dressed in Maori costume and holding a taiaha 1930s. Arero 's detail Use Mau rƒÅkau is the martial art that teaches the use of the taiaha and other MƒÅori weapons in combat. As with other martial arts styles, students of the taiaha spend years mastering the skills of timing, balance and co- ordination necessary to wield the weapon effectively. The taiaha is widely known due to its use in the wero -- the traditional MƒÅori challenge during the p≈çwhiri, a formal welcoming ceremony. A wero is commonly given to heads of state and visiting dignitaries welcomed to New Zealand. The taiaha is one of many cultural items which are used to introduce children in school to MƒÅori culture. They are also used in present-day kapa haka competitions, and training with the taiaha is seen as part of the MƒÅori cultural revival. History The use of traditional MƒÅori weaponry declined after the Europeans arrived in New Zealand. Weapons like the taiaha were replaced by the European's muskets and para whakawai, or traditional MƒÅori weaponry training schools, disappeared altogether. As a result, the traditional weaponry knowledge was lost among many Maori tribes. Some tribes managed to maintain their distinctive traditions by passing down traditional knowledge secretly between a few chosen individuals. During the MƒÅori cultural renaissance in the 1980s, there has been a renewed interest and cultivation of traditional weapons. Although there is a much narrower range of traditional weapons being revived, the MƒÅori weaponry has expanded to become a significant trademark of MƒÅori culture. This revival has been part of the larger MƒÅori cultural renaissance that began in the late 1960s. The survival of MƒÅori weaponry was only possible with the work and activism of remaining experts like Irirangi Tiakiawa, Pita Sharples, John Rangihau, Matiu Mareikura and Mita Mohi. Modern para whakawai In a modern context, MƒÅori weaponry is severely limited to just a few types, with the taiaha being one of the most popular. Likewise, only a small number of para whakawai are in operation‚Äîmost are taught within a tribal framework. Much of the knowledge within today's para whakawai is presented with a background of a deeper tribal history, offering a strong sense of identity, kinship and belonging. The para whakawai on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua trains members of Te Arawa and other interested individuals in weaponry ideologies, theories and beliefs. This programme was established under the guidance of Mita Mohi in the mid-1980s. This programme was extended to the Christchurch area in the 90s being delivered by Temairiki Williams and the group Te Tohu O Tu. The para whakawai Te Whare T≈´ Taua o Aotearoa began at Hoani Waititi marae in Auckland and grew to include a number of outreach programmes in different regions. It was established by Pita Sharples in the 1980s ‚Äòto offer the ancient art of mau rakau back to Maoridom as an innovative programme‚Äô. Weapons training Warfare and weaponry were essential to the traditionally militant MƒÅori society. Children were prepared for warfare from an early age. Their early training included playing activities like boxing, wrestling and stick-throwing games. In the para whakawai, the young men learned mau rƒÅkau (the use of weapons). They were instructed in battle formations, weapon use, and attack and defense maneuvers. They would often participate in mock battles using reeds instead of the real weapons. Rakanga waewae (skilful footwork) was vital to fighting and using weapons. Using weapons, especially the taiaha, takes \\"a lot of maneuvering. It is dangerous. It requires hours, days, months and years of constant use to master it.\\" Weapons To MƒÅori, weapons were more than just implements of warfare ‚Äî they were taonga (treasures), and handed down as precious heirlooms from generation to generation. Weapons were made of wood, stone and bone in a slow, painstaking process. Traditionally, a long weapon from hardwood could take months to shape and decorate; a stone patu would take over a year to complete. Though it took time to fashion weapons, the level of dedication and pride in creating these objects made them valuable. Karakia (incantations) were sometimes said over weapons to imbue them with deities and make them tapu (sacred). Popular culture Charles Bennett's honour *The coat of arms of New Zealand depicts a MƒÅori warrior with a taiaha as one of the supporters. *The New Zealand Army includes an image of a taiaha in its official badge since 1998. * The squadron badge of No. 3 Squadron Royal New Zealand Air Force is a Maori Warrior wielding a Taiaha. *The taiaha was featured in the award- winning 2002 film, Whale Rider and more briefly in the film Once Were Warriors. *In the TV series, Deadliest Warrior, the taiaha is one of the MƒÅori warrior's weapons in a contest with a Shaolin monk. *The taiaha was also featured in two video games for the PlayStation 2, The Mark of Kri and its sequel Rise of the Kasai as a weapon for the games' hero, Rau. In The Mark of Kri, the taiaha is plunged into the ground but, in MƒÅori culture, this is an offense as the taiaha itself is seen as a guardian ancestor related to the war god T≈´matauenga, father of the first man. * The character Haka from the card game Sentinels of the Multiverse wields a taiaha as a weapon.

Although he spent his early career as a newspaper sports writer and editor, becoming the sports editor of the Atlanta Journal at age 23, he is much better known for his humorous newspaper columns in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was also a popular stand-up comedian and lecturer. Grizzard also published a total of 25 books, including collections of his columns (e.g. Chili Dawgs Always Bark at Night), expanded versions of his stand-up comedy routines (I Haven't Understood Anything Since 1962), and the autobiographical If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground. Although much of his comedy discussed the South and Grizzard's personal and professional lives, it was also a commentary on issues prevalent throughout America, including relationships between men and women (e.g. If Love Were Oil, I'd Be About a Quart Low), politics, and health, especially heart health. Grizzard was also the stepbrother of the Southern humorist Ludlow Porch. Biography Grizzard was born in Fort Benning, Georgia.Riley, Sam G. (1995). Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists, pp. 112-14. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. .Ruppersburg, Hugh (ed.) (1994). Georgia Voices, Volume Two: Nonfiction, pp. 556-57. Athens and London: The University of Georgia Press. . His father, Lewis Grizzard, Sr., was a soldier in the United States Army who served in both World War II and the Korean War, and was a sole survivor of a Chinese attack that wiped out his platoon. Lewis Sr. left his wife Christine, a school teacher, when Lewis Jr. was young, and mother and son moved in with Christine's parents in Moreland, Georgia, where Lewis spent the rest of his childhood. Grizzard recounted his often frustrating relationship with his father in My Daddy Was a Pistol and I'm a Son of a Gun, and blamed his father's difficulties in civilian life on what at the time was called \\"battle fatigue\\" and is now called post-traumatic stress disorder, saying, \\"Daddy came home from his second war\\" (the Korean War) \\"a complete mess, the Army did nothing to help him, and he died young.\\" He began his writing early, publishing stories of his Little League team in the nearby Newnan Times-Herald, Newnan, Georgia. Grizzard attended the University of Georgia in Athens, where he was a member of the Sigma Pi fraternity and Gridiron Secret Society. During his time in Athens, he became an avid Georgia Bulldogs fan. He studied journalism, but he shunned the school newspaper in favor of the independent Athens Daily News. Before graduating with an bachelor's degree in journalism, Grizzard moved on to Atlanta, joining the Atlanta Journal, and becoming the youngest-ever executive sports editor of the Journal at the age of 23. The executive editor of the Journal, Jim Minter, said that had Grizzard stayed there, he would be remembered today as one of the great newspaper editors of the 20th century. His time there included the Marshall University football team tragedy and the Journals coverage of Hank Aaron's 715th home run. Grizzard then left to become the executive sports editor at the Chicago Sun-Times. He later recalled this as the most miserable period of his life. His tenure included a controversy involving the removal of several news columns written by Lacy Banks, the Sun-Times first African- American sports columnist, from the newspaper, which resulted in Banks charging racism against Grizzard and led to Banks's subsequent firing. Although the newspaper, under editor Jim Hoge, supported Grizzard, a federal arbitrator reinstated Banks, and he criticized Grizzard as \\"racially insensitive\\". Grizzard, for his part, contended that the arbitrator did not understand the newspaper business, and he pointed out that he had replaced Banks with Thom Greer, a writer who was also African-American. Grizzard felt this invalidated any charge of racism. One Chicago radio announcer who sympathized with Grizzard said that Grizzard had been pronounced \\"guilty by geography\\".If I Ever Get Back To Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet To The Ground, page 328. Grizzard was also divorced for the second time while living in Chicago. Grizzard's career as a newspaper man in Chicago is recalled in If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground. In 1977, Grizzard returned to Atlanta as a columnist for the sports section of the Atlanta Constitution newspaper. After eight months, he switched to writing the humor/life column that eventually made him famous. He published this column about four days per week. At his peak, he was syndicated in 450 newspapers and making regular appearances on television and the stand-up comedy circuit. His popularity in Atlanta was such that the alternative newspaper Creative Loafing, in its annual \\"Best of Atlanta\\" poll, included the categories \\"Best Columnist\\" and \\"Best Columnist besides Lewis Grizzard\\". Grizzard often drew criticism for his disparaging remarks about gay people and feminists, and his dislike for the New South and reflections on the \\"Old South\\" of his youth were frequently misinterpreted. Nevertheless, he was extremely popular in the South, and he had enduring popularity across the nation because of the perceived humor, humanity, patriotism, and \\"old-fashioned\\" values that permeated his writing. His frequent bewilderment by sociocultural trends in the 1980s and 1990s struck a chord with many baby boom readers. Grizzard refused to use computers, writing every column or book on a regular typewriter. (\\"When I write, I like to hear some noise\\", he wrote.) In 1988, Grizzard made his acting debut on the sitcom Designing Women, in the episode \\"Oh Brother\\", which first aired on 18 January 1988. Grizzard played the role of Clayton Sugarbaker, the half-brother of Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker. Clayton was a former mental patient aspiring to be a stand-up comedian. Grizzard had a somewhat troubled life, battling alcoholism, and going through three divorces. He was voted \\"the Author From Hell\\" at a publishing convention for his behavior on book tours. He also suffered from a congenital heart defect ‚Äî a valve problem. In his own words, \\"There are three little leaflets that control the flow of blood to the heart. I was born with only two of those leaflets. It was just after the Great War, so there may have been a shortage. Either that or my daddy didn't get a good toe-hold.\\" His near-death after his third valve-replacement surgery in 1993 brought in over 50,000 letters from well-wishers. He later attributed his miraculous recovery to the prayers of his fans. A few days after marrying for the fourth time, Grizzard died of complications of his fourth heart-valve surgery. Prior to his surgery, he was asked if he had any questions; his reply: \\"I just have one question: When's the next bus to Albuquerque?\\"https://www.tribnow.com/opinions/laughter-still- best-medicine-remembering-grizzard%E2%80%99s-humor As a result of the surgery, Grizzard suffered from brain damage, according to one report, from lack of oxygen to his brain. Had he survived, he would have been quite impaired. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and some of his ashes were scattered at the 50-yard line of the Sanford Stadium at the University of Georgia. The typewriter he used to author columns about the Atlanta Braves' 1991 \\"worst to first\\" season is on display in the library of the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. Grizzard never fathered any children, but he did adopt Jordan, the daughter of his fourth wife.http://onlineathens.com/stories/101010/new_718297877.shtml A Lewis Grizzard Museum, featuring personal effects and professional memorabilia such as his typewriter, is now open in Moreland, Georgia.

Biography Archibald was the eldest son of Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll and Isabel Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Lord Lorne. He was made Master of the Royal Household of James IV of Scotland on 24 March 1495.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 107, citing Register of the Great Seal, vol. 2, no. 2240. After a crisis of law and order in the west of Scotland, Argyll was made governor of Tarbert Castle and Baillie of Knapdale, and this was followed by an appointment as Royal Lieutenant in the former Lordship of the Isles on 22 April 1500.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 178, citing Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 1, nos. 413, 513, 520. Argyll eventually rose to the position of Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. His \\"clan\\" was rivalled only by Clan Gordon. The Earls of Argyll were hereditary Sheriffs of Lorne and Argyll. However, a draft record of the 1504 Parliament of Scotland records a move to request Argyll to hold his Sherriff Court at Perth, where the King and his council could more easily oversee proceedings, if the Earl was found at fault. The historian Norman Macdougall suggests this clause may have been provoked by Argyll's kinship with Torquil MacLeod and MacLean of Duart.MacDougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 184-5, citing Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 2, (1814), 241. These western chiefs supported the suppressed Lordship of the Isles. The Earl of Argyll was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, with the king and many others.

It was first published in De Nieuwe Standaard in 1945 and soon became popular. Although not in its earlier form, the strip adapted to the Ligne claire style, pioneered by Herg√©. This change took place when the strip became serialised in Herg√©'s Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin from 1948 to 1959. The books revolve around the adventures of the eponymous Spike and Suzy, two children (pre- adolescent or adolescent depending on the album), along with their friends and family. The stories combine elements of comedy, fantasy, and science fiction, such as talking animals, time travel and ghosts. The strip still runs daily in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, and new books continue to be published; as of May 2020, 382 albums have been published. Main characters The main characters are a group of friends, living familywise though the only blood- relation is Sidonia being an aunt of Suzy. In the first regular comic, Suzy and her aunt Sidonia meet the orphan Spike and unrelated Professor Barabas. In the next album De Sprietatoom, they also meet Ambrose. Later, in De dolle musketiers (book #18, 1953), Jerom (called Jethro in the UK version), the \\"strongest man in the western hemisphere\\", was introduced. Apart from Suzy and Aunt Sidonia, none of them are related, and other family is only introduced occasionally to drive a particular story. * Spike: originally Suske (Flemish diminutive of Fran√ßois/Franciscus), also known as Willy or Bob (in French), is a young orphan who becomes friends with Suzy and Aunt Sidonia. This happens only in the second album, Het Eiland Amoras from 1946, which would become the first in the regular series. For the first album, the publisher had pushed Vandersteen to go with the name and character \\"Rikki\\", but the author soon worked around this and found a way to introduce \\"Suske\\", in part because he thought Rikki resembled Tintin too much. :Spike has black hair with a small trademark spike. He started out as a hyperactive and headlong fighter, not unlike many a young male adolescent in the \\"Seefhoek\\", the Antwerp neighbourhood where Vandersteen grew up. Only in the first album, Spike would get totally out of control when he heard the battle cry \\"Seefhoek vooruit!\\" (\\"Seefhoek Forward!\\"), replaced by \\"Antigoon vooruit\\" in later reprints. But as soon as his outfit evolved from mere duds towards a more tidy red polo shirt and black trousers, he became a well-behaved and obedient boy. He is smart, brave, idealistic and mostly rational, making him an emotional opposite to Suzy. Where she gets in trouble with Sidonia or Ambrose, he acts as go- between to restore peace. Louisa Ghijs was Vandersteen's inspiration for the name Wiske. * Suzy: originally Wiske (Flemish diminutive of Louise/Louisa), also known as Wanda or Bobette (in French), is the young heroine. She first appeared in the very first out-of-series prequel Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije from 1945, where she has an older brother Rikki, but he disappears after that story to be replaced by Spike. :Suzy lives together with him and her aunt Sidonia, and is typically (certainly in the older stories) dressed in a white dress with a red stripe just above the hem, and a red ribbon in her fair hair. In the first stories, she looks like a preschooler of about 6 years old, but soon afterwards she evolves into a young teenager of about 12-13. Vandersteen seems to have modelled her after his oldest daughter Leen, of similar age at the time. :She is strong-headed, impulsive, curious and slightly foolish. Aspects of her character that come naturally with a young teenager who enters puberty, and a great plot device since her repeated stubbornness and inobedience is the source of many an adventure. Since her emotions and human shortcomings often overpower her rationality, she is sensitive to paranormal and mystical happenings that are routinely dismissed by the others. Her relationship with Spike (both are considered orphans) is mostly one between siblings, although at times it looks like there are more feelings under the surface, as she can get quite jealous and querulous when Spike gets female attention. Suzy is also a brave girl, especially when it comes to defending her doll Muffin, for whom she shows unconditional motherly love. Despite her difficult character at times, she appears contrite and righteous. She carries her heart in the right place and won't hesitate to battle injustice. :Suzy ends most of the albums by winking to the reader from within the very last panel. * Muffin, originally Schalulleke, later renamed to Schanulleke (sometimes Schabolleke), also known as Molly or Sawdust, is Suzy's doll. A small female figure, she is inanimate. She has a major role in a few stories when she gets stolen (album 6, \\"Prinses Zagemeel\\"), brought to life, or is turned into a mindless giant. The original name Schalulleke, a Flemish dialect word for a scallion, was not acceptable in the Netherlands since lul is a Dutch slang word for penis. * Aunt Sidonia, originally called tante Sidonie, later renamed to tante Sidonia, and also once known as Agatha, appears as Suzy's aunt, right from the first album. Sidonia was Vandersteen's way of providing a caring authority figure for Spike and Suzy without introducing actual parents, who would constrain their adventurous tendencies too much. :Sidonia is portrayed as a (1950‚Äôs) housewife (cooking and cleaning, doing the dishes, complaining when Spike and Suzy don‚Äôt show proper respect for her household work). Nevertheless she also often joins the heroes on their adventures, and occasionally shows unexpected qualities as pilot of the Gyronef. :Long and extremely thin with gigantic feet (routinely referred to as ‚Äúferries‚Äù), with a large protruding chin and fair hair, she‚Äôs hardly blessed with physical beauty. As such, her looks are often the target of offensive remarks, in particular by a less than subtle Ambrose. On the other hand, her thinness enables her to pull off tricks like hiding herself in a split second from the bad guys behind nearby streetlights and telephone poles. :Sidonia is also known for her hysterical nervous breakdowns, where she can often no longer utter words while her body ends up as stiff as a wooden plank, and for her (unrequited) crush on Ambrose. * Professor Barabas, is a long-time friend of Suzy and Aunt Sidonia, first met in Het Eiland Amoras (An Island called Hoboken). He starts off as a jungle explorer with a topee, but later becomes the archetypical comics professor: glasses, a white laboratory coat, often absent-minded because he is thinking deeply about some scientific question. Although he is not a mad scientist, and entirely benevolent, his inventions regularly cause trouble when they end up in the wrong hands. This happens more than once because of his lack of streetwiseness in dealing with criminals. His main inventions are the Teletime machine (which enables them to travel through time and space), the Gyronef (a helicopter well ahead of its time), the Terranef (a subterranean vehicle), and the Klankentapper, which enables one to talk with plants and inanimate objects. Contrary to most other main characters, he does not appear in all comics. * Ambrose, originally called Lambik and once known as Orville, is a bald man (apart from six hairs, three on either side) of about fifty. The original Flemish name was inspired by a Belgian beer Lambic that is brewed in the Belgian region of Pajottenland, where Vandersteen lived for a short time. He is first encountered in album 3, The Zincshrinker, as a rather stupid plumber, although Vandersteen already created the standalone personage the year before (1945) as \\"Pukkel\\" (\\"pimple\\" in English). :In the beginning, Ambrose was presented as a typical working class member: rough and rather simple and uneducated. Prone to alcoholism and other scourges, he also had a somewhat tragic side. This largely came to an end when Vandersteen started to work for Herg√©, who didn't like the folksy component. In particular in the period of The Blue Series, Ambrose suddenly becomes sophisticated, bright and brave, even aristocratic (for example he teaches fencing) and is arguably truly the main character of the story in those albums. Later, the personage gets its definitive outfit (black trousers, white starched shirt and a black bow tie) and settles as a middle class part- time father figure for Spike and Suzy, who lives together with Jethro. :Ambrose is intended as the comic relief of the series. His baldness and pronounced nose inspire ridicule throughout the whole series. Another running gag is that he brings up his World War I military gear (sandbags, barbed wire, helmet, rifle...) when a situation becomes critical. Generally presumptuous, vain and impulsive, he confronts the reader with his own shortcomings. Typically, he considers himself the main hero, and in particular the \\"brains\\", since he can't possibly over trump Jethro when it comes to physical power (and as it frequently turns out, not in the intellectual department either!). His friends then usually play along, just to keep him happy. The relationship between Suzy and Ambrose, one even more stubborn than the other, makes for a great generation conflict that spices up many stories. In the end, Ambrose does have a noble nature, as illustrated by the many occasions that he sacrifices himself for the greater good. But it helps a great deal when he is first assured of recognition... * Jethro, originally known as Jerom or Jerommeke and also known as Wilbur, is an extremely strong man, brought from prehistory to the Middle Ages by an alchemist in album 18, The merry musketeers, as a mindless weapon. :Although he is introduced into the series as an opponent, he quickly turns around as he falls in love with Muffin and becomes a caring man instead of a wild beast. Initially he is dressed in a loincloth only (with an occasional cravat added in an amusing attempt to appear more civilized) and speaks in grunts and monosyllables. His prehistoric background causes him to observe the modern world and customs with the naivete (and often unimpeded insight) of a child. But soon afterwards he becomes a smart, sophisticated man, although he still speaks in a peculiar shorthand. He lives together with Ambrose, and his level-headedness is used to contrast with the latter‚Äôs foolishness. :Apart from superhuman strength (used for exploits like squeezing water from rocks in the desert), his special powers include ‚Äúflashlight eyes‚Äù and X-ray vision (at any other time his eyelids remain closed), running faster than sound and stopping bullets with his muscular chest. As such, his character is often used as a deus ex machina solution for the troubles his friends and especially Ambrose get in. But when the scenarists are inspired, he is equally often drugged or away on a trip as to avoid the easy solution for the story.  Other recurring characters  * Krimson. A principal villain, Krimson was introduced in Het rijmende paard (#48, 1963). He survives a plane-crash and starts over as an international drug kingpin in De sissende sampan (#49, 1963) before serving a prison- sentence. In Amoris van Amoras (#200, 1984) Krimson seems to have changed his ways by becoming a project-developer on Hoboken. This appears to be a passing interest as De Kwaaie Kwieten (#209, 1987) marks his return to form by constructing a top-secret military base capable of fighting extraterrestrials. Growing stronger again, Krimson manages to overthrow the Belgian government (De Krimson Crisis, #215, 1988). For reasons unknown he often suffers from mental breakdowns, throwing fits until his butler force feeds him a large quantity of pills. Despite his name there is no connection between him and the colour crimson, other than that both often have sinister connotations. * Arthur is Ambrose's younger brother who grew up in the jungle and gained the ability to fly from the juice of a plant. He is more primitive than his brother, but substantially smarter. He dresses in animal skins and wears a beard, though it is unknown if he, unlike Ambrose, has much hair on his head as he always sports a bowler hat. He spends more time in the air and in trees than on the ground, and therefore has acquired some bird characteristics, such as standing on his hands instead of his feet and chirping while speaking. His favorite food is birdseed. He has appeared in 5 albums so far. * Sus Antigoon is an ancestor of Spike, discoverer of Amoras Island and founder of the city Amoras. He died of alcohol abuse and therefore always appears as a ghost with a bottle chained to his leg. Because of his drunkenness, Sus Antigoon often brings the protagonists in danger. He has appeared in 12 albums so far. Character evolution Over the course of the series, characters are added and changed, and stories become more didactic. Ambrose and Jethro change significantly: in the beginning, Ambrose was just an amusing fool, but in the Blue Series he appears more sophisticated and heroic, evolving towards a cynical and sceptical man in the current stories. In early stories, Jethro was initially portrayed as an ignorant strong man, who evolved into a sophisticated and quiet man in later works. In most stories Muffin is only a doll, but one very special to Suzy, and they are inseparable. In some stories Muffin comes to life and plays an important role.  Settings  In the earliest stories, Willy Vandersteen used fictional countries like \\"Chokowakije\\" (\\"Chocolaslovakia\\") and \\"Amoras\\" (a tropical island, \\"Hoboken\\", actually a real town in Belgium, in the English-language version). He dropped the use of those after a few stories, although some later stories revisit Amoras. Most of the current adventures of Spike and Suzy happen in real countries all over the world, with Belgium (their home country) as main focus for many stories. While in the early stories large distances were usually traveled using the fictitious Gyronef, an experimental helicopter devised by professor Barabas, starting from the 1960s all air travel is provided by the Dutch national airline KLM, making it an early and prominent example of product placement in European comics. Vandersteen chose KLM over the Belgian national airline SABENA because of his friendship with Ron Winderink, PR manager at KLM. Publication history Willy Vandersteen created Suske en Wiske, beginning publication in De Nieuwe Standaard on 30 March 1945. To Vandersteen's disappointment the editor had renamed the strip's first chapter Rikki en Wiske. The following story was titled De avonturen van Suske en Wiske - Op het eiland Amoras and no longer featured Rikki. After a few years of publication in several newspapers, Vandersteen was approached by Herg√©, intent to improve sales of the Dutch language Kuifje, who wanted Suske and Wiske for his publications rebuilt in the Ligne claire style. Vandersteen made the adaptation and Suske en Wiske first appeared in Kuifje and Belgian Tintin on September 16, 1948 with the story titled Het Spaanse spook and Le Fant√¥me Espagnol in the two languages. All 8 stories that were run until it ended in April 1959 made up the material collected in The Blue Series. Vandersteen established Studio Vandersteen in 1952 to manage his expanded activities. To have time for other series such as De Rode Ridder (The Red Knight) and Tijl Uilenspiegel, he gave Paul Geerts the job of creating new albums of Suske en Wiske in 1968. Geerts did this until 2001, when he gave this task to Marc Verhaegen. From 2005 on, a team of writers and cartoonists makes the new series, led by Luc Morjeau. These authors are helped by Studio Vandersteen. Publications Newspapers and magazines Before Suske en Wiske appeared as albums, they were published in several newspapers and magazines, such as: * De Standaard (1945-...) daily newspaper * Tintin magazine and Kuifje magazine (1948‚Äì1959) √âditions du Lombard's French and Dutch sister publications * TV Ekspres (1972‚Äì2001) weekly TV magazine * Suske en Wiske Weekblad (1993‚Äì2003) weekly comics magazine Red Series and Blue Series The books are generally divided into two groups - Red Series and Blue series. The Red Series contains the vast majority of the books, and is so called because all of the books in this series have a red coloured cover. There are only a few books in the blue series, and they are so called because of their blue cover. The blue series encompasses all those originally published in Tintin and Kuifje. The Red series is everything published before or after. The following album series exist: * 1.The Red Series # The Flemish non-coloured series (1946‚Äì1959): 1-35 # The French non-coloured series # The non-coloured series in Dutch for the Netherlands (1953‚Äì1959): 1-23 # The Flemish two-coloured series (1959‚Äì1964): 7,19,20,32-50 # The French two-coloured series # The Dutch two-coloured series (1959‚Äì1964): 1,8,10,11,21-50 # The \\"uniform\\" Flemish(-Belgian) - Dutch (two- coloured) series (1964‚Äì1966): 51-66 (under flamingantistic influence) # The four-coloured series (1967-...): 67-... ; the first 66 albums and the blue series have been re-edited in this series. * 2.The Blue Series (1952‚Äì1957) Special editions Other stories or editions have been published, such as: # The collector's editions (1958-...) # Advertisement editions (1965-...) # Various collections (1972-...) # Holiday editions (1973-...) # Luxury editions (1977-...) # Suske en Wiske Classics (1993‚Äì1999) Albums in English English translations have been published in three incarnations. The first was in the U.S., under the name of Willy and Wanda. It was then published in the UK in the 1990s named Bob and Bobette, a copy of the Belgian title in French. The final print run was in the UK by the title Spike and Suzy. Other languages Logo of Bob and Bobette, the French version of Spike and Suzy The comic book series was also published in Belgium in French, under the name Bob et Bobette (Bob and Bobette in English). Translations in other languages (including regional dialects) are plentiful but may exist as short-lived series only. Books out of the series have been published in the following languages as: * Afrikaans: Neelsie en Miemsie * Brabantian: Suske en Wieske * Chinese (standard version): Ê≥¢Â∏ÉÂíåÊ≥¢Ë¥ùÁâπ (Bobu & Bobete: 1996) or ËãèËãèÂíåÁª¥Áª¥ÂéÜÈô©ËÆ∞ (Susu & WeiWei: from 2011) * Chinese (Taiwanese version): ÈÅîÈÅîÂíåË≤ùË≤ùÊ≠∑Èö™Ë®ò (Dada & Beibei) * Danish: Finn & Fiffi (later: Bob & Bobette) * Esperanto: Cisko kaj Vinjo * Finnish: Anu ja Antti * German: Ulla und Peter (later: Bob und Babette/Suske und Wiske/Frida und Freddie) * Greek: Bobi & Lou * Hebrew: Bob & Bobet * Indonesian: Bobby dan Wanda (later: Suske dan Wiske) * Icelandic: Siggi og Vigga * Irish: Spike agus Suzy * Italian: Bob e Bobette * Japanese: „Çπ„Çπ„Ç´„Å®„Ç¶„Ç£„Çπ„Ç´ (Susuka & Wisuka) * Latin: Lucius et Lucia * Norwegian: Finn & Fiffi * Portuguese: Bibi & Baba * Portuguese (Brazil): Z√© & Maria * Spanish: Bob y Bobette, Bob y Bobet * Swahili: Bob na Bobette * Swedish: Finn och Fiffi * Tamil: Bayankaap & Bayanam * Tibetan: Baga & Basang * Persian: ÿ®Ÿàÿ®€å Ÿà ÿ®Ÿàÿ®ÿ™ ( Bobi & Bobet ) * Polish: Lucek i Lu≈õka * Slovenian: Spike in Suzy * Russian: –°–ø–∞–π–∫ –∏ –°—å—é–∑–∏ Spin-off series There have been various spin-off comic series from Spike and Suzy: * In 1960, Jerom began publication. It featured the character Jerom (Jethro) and focused on his adventures as a modern-day knight. * In the 1950s, Lambik (Ambrose), ran in the newspaper De Bond. These were then put into the albums called De Grappen van Lambik (\\"The jokes of Ambrose\\"). The series was ended in 1962, but in 2004, it resumed with new stories. Seven books in the new series have been released. * In 2002, Klein Suske en Wiske (\\"Young Spike and Suzy\\") ran in the magazine Suske en Wiske Weekblad. It charts the adventures of the children when they were very small, along with their pet dog. So far nine albums have been released, containing short sketches. * In May 2013, the first edition of Amoras was released, a spin-off, more adult-oriented series, with a more manga-alike type of drawing and with more violence and strong language. In the series, Spike and Suzy are 'flashed' by accident to the year 2047 and find themselves on the isle of Amoras (where they were in the first Belgian album). Charel Cambr√© came up with the original idea and drew the art, the scenario was written by Marc Legendre. The first issue, called Wiske, received a lot of positive response and media coverage. The sixth and last in de spin-off series was published on the 4th of November 2015. * Although Standaard uitgeverij was adamant that this was a one time only, news of a new series within the same spin-off universe reached the fans in March 2016. In 'De Kronieken van Amoras' the reader gets more background info on the events leading to the story in Amoras' and about the different characters. In March 2017, De zaak Krimson was released and there are two more publications planned within this series. Adaptations Suske en Wiske Children's Museum in Kalmthout. Suske en Wiske has reached such a popularity in the Dutch-speaking world that various media adaptations have been made. Theatrical adaptations In 1949 Dutch puppeteer Karel Weyler of the Flemish puppet theater Pats' Poppenspel adapted some Suske en Wiske series as puppet plays. Willy Vandersteen enjoyed these versions and gave him permission to make more. The music was composed by Armand Preud'homme and the dialogues were written by Jef Contrijn, whose wife, Germaine Gijsels also designed the costumes. Vandersteen returned the favor by helping to design the backgrounds and referencing \\"Pats Poppenspel\\" in the Suske en Wiske stories \\"De Mottenvanger\\" (\\"The Moth Catcher\\"), \\"De Circusbaron\\" (\\"The Circus Baron\\"), \\"Het Hondenparadijs\\" (\\"The Dog Paradise\\"), \\"De Wilde Weldoener\\" (\\"The Wild Humanitarian\\") and \\"De Poppenpakker\\" (\\"The Puppet Catcher\\"). Between 1974 and 1977 Vandersteen also made a comics series about \\"Pats\\" until copyright issues forced him to change the title into \\"Tits\\". In 1994 the Royal Youth Theatre of Antwerp made a theatrical musical called \\"De Stralende Sterren\\". It ran for several years and was both a success in Flanders as well as the Netherlands. In July 2002 a new musical premiered, based on the album \\"De Spokenjagers\\" (\\"The Ghost Hunters\\"), again touring with huge success in Flanders and the Netherlands. In 2008 the album \\"De Circusbaron\\" (\\"The Circus Baron\\") was adapted into a theatrical musical, which toured in Belgium and the Netherlands. TV adaptations In 1955 the Pats Poppenspel puppet shows were broadcast on Flemish television. This was the first attempt to bring the comics to television. A limited animation series was made the same decade. Far more successful was the 1975-1976 puppet series. The Belgian TV network BRT produced a TV puppet series consisting of six original stories told by Lambik, all of them broadcast as five-minute episodes, which were each 22 minutes in length. These stories (\\"De Minilotten van Kokonera\\", \\"De Gouden Locomotief\\", \\"De Zingende Kaars\\", \\"De Windbrekers\\", \\"De Regenboogprinses\\" and \\"Het Laatste Dwaallicht\\") were later adapted into comic book albums. The puppets were made by Creatuur in collaboration with Andr√© Henderickx. Vandersteen's studio created the backgrounds and props. The series was a tremendous success in the Netherlands and largely responsible for the comics' ultimate breakthrough there. Re-runs were broadcast in 1985 and 1990. In the early 1990 an animated TV series was made by Atelier5, broadcast on Vtm. Each episode was based on original Suske en Wiske stories, with Han Peekel as narrating voice-over. They were also made available on video. Film adaptations In 2004 the album \\"De Duistere Diamant\\" (\\"The Dark Diamond\\") was adapted to the silver screen by Rudi Van den Bossche as the live-action film '. A CGI animated film called Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers was released in July 2009. Produced by Skyline Entertainment, it was planned to be the first of a series of 13 films. Video game adaptations In 2001, Infogrames released Suske en Wiske: De Tijdtemmers for the Game Boy Color. It was only released in Europe. On July 19, 2009 Nintendo DS a video game was released, based on the 3-D animated movie Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers. In popular culture Suske and Wiske have their own statue in the Antwerp Zoo in Antwerp. It was sculpted by Ren√© Rosseel in 1978. Suske, Wiske, Lambik and Jerom also have statues in Middelkerke, sculpted by Monique Mol in respectively 2002, 2005 and 2013 In the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Willy Vandersteen. In the room dedicated to his work a replica of Professor Barabas' teletijdmachine (\\"tele time machine\\") can be seen.http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf On June 15, 1995 an illustrated wall was dedicated to the series in the Laekenstraat in Brussels, Belgium. Suske and Wiske are also part of an illustrated wall in the Korte Ridderstraat 8 in Antwerp, which was revealed on May 13, 2006. On April 24, 2009 a similar wall was revealed in Kalmthout. The character Lambik inspired the name of the Dutch comic book store Lambiek in Amsterdam. The misspelling of the name is due to the fact that the early Dutch publications of \\"Suske en Wiske\\" called him \\"Lambiek\\". The emblem on the store's sign is an image from the Suske en Wiske story \\"Prinses Zagemeel\\" (\\"Princess Sawdust\\") (1947-1948) and represents Lambik's metamorphosis into a centaur.

It is around five miles () south of Scarborough. It is generally regarded as the most important and informative Mesolithic site in Great Britain. It is as important to the Mesolithic period as Stonehenge is to the Neolithic period or Scandinavian York is to understanding Viking Age Britain. The site was occupied during the early Mesolithic archaeological period, which coincided with the preboreal and boreal climatic periods. Though the ice age had ended and temperatures were close to modern averages, sea levels had not yet risen sufficiently to separate Britain from continental Europe. Highlights among the finds include Britain‚Äôs oldest structure, 21 red deer stag skull-caps that may have been headdresses and nearly 200 projectile, or harpoon, points made of red deer antler. These organic materials were preserved due to having been buried in waterlogged peat. Normally all that remains on Mesolithic sites are stone tools. Excavation of the site began in 1948, a year after artefacts were first noticed by John Moore, an amateur archaeologist. The site is most famous for some of the extremely rare artefacts discovered during the original excavations but its importance has been reinforced by new understandings of the nature and extent of the Mesolithic archaeology in the area and reinterpretations of the original material. General information Environmental context Star Carr now lies under farmland at the eastern end of the Vale of Pickering. During the Mesolithic the site was near the outflow at the western end of a palaeolake, known as Lake Flixton. At the end of the last ice age a combination of glacial and post-glacial geomorphology caused the area to drain to the west (away from the shortest-distance to the North Sea at Filey). The basin filled by Lake Flixton was probably created by glacial 'scarring'. The site is preserved due to Lake Flixton having been in- filled with peat during the course of the Mesolithic. Waterlogged peat prevents organic finds from oxidising and has led to some of the best preservation conditions possible (such conditions have preserved the famous bog bodies found in other parts of northern Europe). As a result of such good conditions archaeologists were able to recover bone, antler and wood in addition to the flints that are normally all that is left on sites from this period. During the period of Mesolithic occupation the area surrounding the lake would have been a mixed forest of birch, aspen and willow. The lake edge and shallows would have been full of reeds, water lily and other aquatic plants and lake levels would have changed dynamically in response to rainfall or snow-melt. These and many other plants would have formed the base of a complex food web. The mammals that we have evidence for include herbivores such as beaver, red deer, roe deer, elk , aurochs, wild boar, hare and carnivores such as wolf, lynx, bear, fox, pine marten, badger and hedgehog. Key artefacts Along with the flints that are characteristic of Mesolithic sites, there were a large number of objects made of red deer and elk antler, elk bone, aurochs bone and one piece of bird bone. Rarer objects included worked amber, shale, haematite, iron pyrites, a decorated pendant, thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain and tightly-rolled pieces of birch-bark and pieces of birch-resin pitch or tar and worked wood. The flint found at Star Carr came from nearby beaches, which at time of occupation would have been about distant, and also from the Yorkshire Wolds immediately to the south of the site. The two most outstanding categories of finds are the 'barbed points' and 'antler frontlets'. The barbed points are made of the antler of red deer stags. They are between and in length and the 195 examples found at Star Carr account for more than 95% of the total number from the British Mesolithic. Many of the barbed points and antler frontlets appear to be deliberately broken. The antler frontlets are made from red deer stag (male) skulls with the antlers still attached. The 21 antler frontlets are sufficiently complete to see how they have been manufactured: two holes were perforated through the skull with a flint tool and the inside of the skull cap was smoothed. The antlers on each frontlet has been carefully trimmed maybe to reduce weight. It seems very likely that these modifications are designed to allow the frontlets to be used as headgear. Finds from the site are now divided between four institutions: The British Museum, the Yorkshire Museum in York, the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge and the Scarborough Museum.British Museum Collection Red Deer Stag skull with holes Barbed points Evidence of structures Post holes, a sunken area and concentrations of flints, burning and other artefacts indicate the presence of a structure approximately wide. The posts were almost certainly made of wood and roughly in diameter. There may have been as many as 18 of them and the holes indicated that several may have been replaced over the course of the structure's use. It is impossible to know the form or materials from which the walls and/or roof would have been made. They may have used hides, thatch, turf or bark on a conical (teepee-like) or rounded (wigwam-like) frame. There is no reason to suppose that the same materials and form would have been used for the structure's entire life-span. There was evidence that the floor was covered with a layer of moss, reeds and other soft plant materials ‚Äì deep. Radiocarbon dates indicated a use-life of between 200 and 500 years. The structure has been compared to the Mesolithic structure found at Howick, Northumberland and British Iron Age roundhouses. A large wooden platform has been discovered nearby on the shore of the former lake ‚Äì the earliest known example of carpentry in Europe, though its purpose is as yet unknown. Timbers of Aspen and Willow were split along the grain using wedges (probably made of wood and antler); these were then laid in the boggy areas at the lake shore, presumably to provide firm footing. The extent of the wooden platform is not known but it may be a significantly larger and more complex undertaking than the house-like structure. Chronology Current radiocarbon dates from the site indicate occupation first commenced between 9335‚Äì9275 BC, lasting for a period of around 800 years until 8525‚Äì8440 BC. However, such occupations may have been episodic in nature, varying in intensity between different periods. History of investigations Discovery and initial excavations Star Carr was discovered in 1947 when John Moore, an amateur archaeologist, noticed flints in the exposed soil of several recently dredged ditches in the eastern Vale of Pickering. One of these sites, bordering on the New Hertford River was to the south of Star Carr Farm. Moore decided to excavate a small trench at Star Carr in 1948 as part of a series of investigations. On the discovery of intact organic remains Moore contacted Professor Grahame Clark of the University of Cambridge via Harry Godwin and the curator of the Scarborough Museum, Arthur Roy Clapham. Clark began his investigation with the explicit aim of building a more detailed picture of the Mesolithic environment and the ways in which people used it.Clark 1972, p. 7 The organic preservation enabled the recovery of the plant and animal remains necessary for this. Clark excavated from 1949 to 1951. Clark's 1954 publication of these excavations is a seminal text in the study of the British Mesolithic and prehistory generally. Clark believed he had uncovered the entirety of the site and believed Star Carr could be used as a type-site for the British Mesolithic. He drew parallels between the finds at Star Carr and the site of Maglemose in Denmark. It is now recognised that many of Clark‚Äôs inferences were incorrect but the excavation remains one of the most important in the study of British prehistory ever undertaken. Further investigations: The Lake Flixton Landscape In 1977 archaeologists excavated Iron Age, Bronze Age and Mesolithic material from Seamer Carr, just to the north of Star Carr. These excavations were conducted in advance of the Seamer Carr landfill site. The discovery of Mesolithic material led to a new series of investigations around Lake Flixton directed by Tim Schadla-Hall (currently University College London). This team returned to Star Carr in 1985 and 1989. This project investigated the archaeology and ecology of the wider landscape around Lake Flixton and found several more Mesolithic sites but none with as many of the unusual artefacts (such as barbed points and antler frontlets) discovered at Star Carr. The latest investigations In the 2000s new excavations began at Star Carr. This reinvestigation is being directed by Nicky Milner (University of York), Chantal Conneller (University of Manchester) and Barry Taylor (University of Chester). This ongoing project has reinvestigated Clark's excavations and also excavated the dry-land, discovering the structure. Animated image showing the sequence of engravings on a pendant excavated from the Mesolithic archaeological site of Starr Carr in 2015 Most significantly, recent geochemical investigations have demonstrated that the preservation conditions have deteriorated. The result of this is that any remaining organic artefacts will be far less informative than those discovered by previous excavation projects. Though the reasons for this remain somewhat unclear, it appears that the acidity of the groundwater has massively increased in the last few years. A decorated pendant (the Star Carr Pendant), thought to be the oldest known Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site in 2015. The 11,000 year old object has been on display at the Yorkshire Museum with other finds from the site since 2016. Interpretive debates Clark, the original excavator, believed the Mesolithic people would have lived on a brushwood platform on the edge of the former Lake Flixton. Recent excavations have revealed that people lived on the dry land upslope of the lake and various activities were carried out at the lake edge. There is much debate about the time of year the site was occupied. Mesolithic people hunted a number of animals including red and roe deer, elk, aurochs and wild boar but there are various seasonal assessments and as the site was occupied over several hundred years it is likely that seasonal practices varied over time. It has been suggested that the antler frontlets were used as a hunting disguise, or in some form of ritual practice. Recent work suggests that these, along with other objects made from red deer antler, appear to have been respectfully deposited at the lake edge due to the spiritual significance of red deer to the people who occupied the site. Anthony Legge and Peter Rowley- Conway re-examined the animal bones located at the site. They found strong evidence to suggest that the site was used only in late spring and summer; evidence that the cull of red and roe deer was biased towards three- and one- year-old animals respectively; revision of available meat; reduction in scale of occupation; no bias towards hunting of male red deer, and tentatively suggested that the site was used as a hunting camp.Star Carr Revisited References Bibliography   External links * New Excavations at Star Carr, University of York * Star Carr, Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge * Red deer antler head-dress from Star Carr, British Museum * Stone Age remains are Britain's earliest house, University of Manchester * Star Carr ‚Äì The Otherside of the Antler, video about the excavations in 2006, Vale of Pickering Archaeological Trust Category:10th millennium BC Category:Mesolithic Europe Category:Stone Age sites in England Category:History of North Yorkshire Category:Archaeological sites in North Yorkshire ","title":"Star Carr"},{"id":"654655","title":"List of loughs of Ireland"},{"id":"654660","text":"Francisco Martin Duran (; born September 8, 1968) is an American criminal who is mostly known for his actions of October 29, 1994, when he fired 29 rounds from an SKS rifle at the White House. Duran was later convicted of attempting to assassinate United States president Bill Clinton and sentenced to 40 years in prison.  Details  On Saturday October 29, 1994, dressed in a trench coat, Duran approached the fence overlooking the north lawn of the White House and fired a 7.62√ó39mm SKS semi-automatic rifle (Chinese-made copy Type 56) at a group of men wearing dark business suits on the White House lawn. Two nearby boys claimed they had remarked aloud just before the shooting that one of the men looked like Clinton. Secret Service agents immediately began running across the lawn, with their guns drawn, when citizens Harry Rakosky, Ken Davis, and Robert Haines tackled Duran and pinned his arms until he could be subdued. Clinton was reportedly inside watching a football game at the time of the shooting and was not harmed. The incident followed just six weeks after Frank Eugene Corder crashed a Cessna into the White House south lawn and prompted debate about closing off traffic on that area of Pennsylvania Avenue. No one was injured in the assassination attempt.  Trial  The most important charges in the two-week trial were attempted murder of the president and four counts of assaulting a federal officer (the Secret Service agents). Duran had served prison time previously, convicted of aggravated assault with a vehicle in the U.S. Army, and therefore, beyond the attempted murder of the President he was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The other charges were use of an assault weapon during a crime of violence, destruction of U.S. property, and interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a felony. Duran pleaded not guilty and mounted an insanity defense, claiming that he was trying to save the world by destroying an alien \\"mist\\", connected by an umbilical cord to an alien in the Colorado mountains. Prosecutors stated he was faking insanity and called more than 60 witnesses to testify that Duran hated government in general and President Clinton in particular. The jury deliberated for under five hours to reject the insanity defense and arrive at the guilty verdict. , Duran is serving his sentence at the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution at Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Florence, Colorado.

Named by the French explorer Jacques Cartier, the island lies on the shortest shipping lane between the Great Lakes and Europe and is on the main north- south shipping route to Hudson Bay and the Northwest Territories. The northern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail is on Belle Isle. Belle Isle rises to about at its highest point and is in area, long and wide. It is nearly from either coast, but it is slightly closer to the Labrador side of the Strait of Belle Isle, and it has a lighthouse (supported by flying buttresses) at both its northern and its southern ends. Officially uninhabited, the island has some seasonal occupation during fishing season. Belle Isle is the northernmost peak of the Appalachian Mountains, which extend in various shapes over southwest to Alabama, United States. Ice patterns show that the island lies at the meeting point of two sea currents. The Labrador Current flows from the northwest, and a smaller current, driven by dominant westerly winds, flows from the southwest. Flow lines in sea ice give a sense of the movement of the ice. Ice floes embedded in the Labrador Current appear as a relatively open pattern. Sea ice with a denser pattern enters from the strait, banking against the west side of Belle Isle. Tendrils flow around capes at both ends of the island, with an ice-free \\"shadow\\" on the opposite, downstream side. Eddies off the western coast in the ice patterns, indicated by curved arrows in this photograph, show the place in which the currents interact north and west of the island. Climate Belle Isle has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc) with short, cool summers and long, severely cold winters lasting most of the year. Precipitation peaks during the warmer months of June‚ÄìSeptember in the form of rain.

Somehow that impressed me more even than the Moon landing, because it was the idea that these are the first guys who went into outer space. They left the Earth. They weren‚Äôt just flying in orbit. They were out there in deep space. My family and I had taken a year off and we were traveling around Europe in a Volkswagen van. I think we were the first yuppie hippy family in history. And we were on the island of Rhodes, Christmas Eve 1968. Terrible weather. Rain pelting down, absolutely black outside. And we‚Äôre all jammed up in our own little life support capsule there, and we‚Äôre listening to the radio. These guys, these men. The first true spacemen. And their voice came disembodied from the depths of space. I didn‚Äôt grow up with a religious background, but when they started reading from the book of Genesis, and [I was] listening to these guys on Christmas Eve out there in the depths for the first time. It just touched me at a vital chord that said: this is the future; and not just the future of mankind but [my] personal future. [I felt] these guys [were] talking to [me]. ‚Äî Savage, telling his story on the documentary Space Colonies in 1999. Savage attended Rifle High, likely from Fall 1969 to Spring 1973. He took a gap year from Fall 1973 to Spring 1974. At some point during the Spokane, Washington World's Fair, 4 May to 3 November 1974, Savage \\"and his buddies\\" drove up to the region. He never forgot its beauty, as 23 years later he would move his young family there permanently to live nearby, in Idaho, in late 1997. After high school, Savage's original ambition was to become an astronaut. He was accepted for Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) at University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder). However, when it became clear that Spiro Agnew's plan for a post-Apollo space program was not going to happen, he declined to continue. Savage instead opted to follow his other interest, literature, and attend Swarthmore College, which he attended for one full year (two semesters) from Fall 1974 to Spring 1975. In early 1975 Gerard K. O'Neill came to Swarthmore to deliver a speech on space colonies. This re-ignited Savage's interest in space. Savage attended a conference, likely the 7‚Äì9 May 1975 Space Manufacturing conference, in Princeton put on by Dr. O'Neill. He then took a break from school for three years, missing the 1975-6, 1976-7, and 1977-8 school years. Savage, April 1978, working for the California Museum of Science and Industry While taking a break from his studies, on 20 April 1978, he was featured in the Yuma Daily Sun while working for the California Museum of Science and Industry's travelling team. His team visited elementary schools, in this case San Pasqual School of Yuma, Arizona. The exhibits gave students \\"firsthand experiences with recent events in the fields of mathematics, the human body, electricity, minerals, science, space exploration, and energy.\\" Savage took two further semesters at Swarthmore, in Fall 1978 and Fall 1979. Perhaps inspired from his experience with the California Museum of Science and Industry, he attended the University of Southern California (USC), taking a variety of classes, including film studies and television production, ultimately completing his English degree there and graduating in 1981. After graduation After graduating from USC, aged 26, he returned to Rifle to participate in managing his family's business interests. Shale Energy Corporation of America In the mid-80s Savage also worked for a small company, Shale Energy Corporation of America (ECA) in Denver. West Anvil Water & Power Company One project he worked on for about five years was a campaign to build a dam on the Colorado River. He founded an entity called \\"West Anvil Water & Power Company\\". He established it with family members to develop the Webster Hill reservoir and hydropower project on the Colorado River. In 1982 this entity applied for a permit to build a dam on this river, submitting an environmental assessment and resource management plan for Glenwood Springs Resource Area, but the application was ultimately rejected by the relevant regulatory agencies. It was after this time, circa 1984, that Savage began to write what would become The Millennial Project, in his spare time. Quality Times Audio Bookstore Circa 1987, with his younger brother Dan, he founded a pioneering audiobook store called Quality Times Audio Bookstore, in Denver, Colorado. \\"As children we were carefully taught how to read,\\" he said in an interview on 1 April 1987 with the Denver Post. \\"But not many people have been taught listening skills. One thing audio books are very good at is reawakening that latent ability to understand and follow the spoken word.\\" More important than the difference between reading and listening, Savage said, is the difference between watching a story on television and listening to a storyteller. \\"The fundamental difference between theater of the eye and theater of the mind is that when you watch TV, everything is presynthesized for you. Theater of the mind is so much more powerful by comparison. Look at what happened in 1938 when Orson Welles' 'War of the Worlds' was aired over national radio. The whole country went berserk. Get a message orally, and your mind fills in the details. Believe me, George Lucas cannot provide the props and special effects that my imagination produces spontaneously.\\" Tri-County Ambulance He returned to Rifle in about 1991 to start an ambulance transfer business called Tri-County Ambulance. Marshall Savage and his brother John Savage were volunteers on the Ambulance Transfer business, but ultimately they decided to buy an ambulance, and start charging people for it. At its peak they had 2 brand-new ambulances. He handed the day-to-day management of this business over to his bride, whom he had just married, in 1993. She managed the business until 1997 when they sold it and moved to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Savage Land Company Savage was also involved as a supervisor of his eldest brother's construction business, building homes on Graham Mesa in Rifle. Savage did not want to continue in this role, however, and resolved to leave Rifle in 1997. Writing career \\\\- Savage published his only book, The Millennial Project, in 1992. \\\\- In November 1997 Savage's 17,000-word feature article \\"Convergence with Destiny\\" was published in the 5th of 13 issues of the First Millennial Foundation / Living Universe Foundation's publication, Distant Star. \\\\- As of early 1997, he was working on another book, on longevity, tentatively titled The Methuselah Project, but at some point afterwards, shelved the project. \\\\- As of August 2018, Savage is working on an expansion of the Moon chapter from TMP into a standalone book, entitled TMP 2.0 (not to be confused with Eric Hunting's website with the same name, which Eric worked on from about 2001 to 2011). Marriage and family In 1993 he married Tami Savage and became step-father to her two children from a previous marriage to a man called Mr. Eichman. * Jeffrey Michael \\"Jeff\\" Eichman (born 1983) * Matthew \\"Matt\\" Eichman (born 1986), a chef.

The Millennial Project From about December 1992 to about November 1997, he was an active member of the tech futurist community, especially after the publication in 1992 of his 512-page magnum opus, The Millennial Project (TMP). Post-FMF In about 1998, he withdrew from active involvement in the FMF. Prompted by a desire not to work in his family's construction business in Rifle, he wished to leave this small town.

Born in the province of Limburg, he was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1926. In the pedagogic environment of the Normal School (pedagogic academy) of Tienen, Belgium, where he taught from 1924, he specialised in characterological studies and devised a new method of characterological analysis, which he called Psychognomy and which was largely based on phrenology, combined with typology and graphology. This led to his life-work, La Psychognomie,Paul Bouts, La Psychognomie, Paris, Dervy-Livres, 1986 initially published in Paris by the \\"Librairie philosophique Alcan\\". It was subsequently translated in Dutch and Portuguese. The theories of Bouts were further developed in specialised institutes which were founded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Chicoutimi, Qu√©bec. Bouts continued his research in the field with the paleo- anthropological work Les Grandioses Destin√©es Individuelle et Humaine dans la Lumi√®re de la Caract√©rologie et de l'Evolution c√©r√©bro-cranienne. In this work he developed a teleological and orthogenetical view on a perfecting evolution, from the paleo-encephalical skull shapes of prehistoric man, which he considered still prevalent in criminals and savages, towards future perfection. After the Second World War, Bouts experienced serious health problems, due to overburdening. These enticed him to study a healthy lifestyle, which he described in his work Modern Hygiene of Intellectuals (published in French as Hygi√®ne Moderne des Intellectuels, and in Dutch under the title Ik ben nooit moe, i.e. I am never tired). He underlined the importance of wholesome, healthy food and of the maintenance of respiratory capacity through exercise. The adoption of this healthy lifestyle allowed him to regain full strength and to lead a productive life until age 99. In 1967 he established himself on the woody Middelberg hill in Rotselaar, Belgium (in Flemish Brabant, 35 km east of Brussels), where he built the St. Paul's Home, as well as a reform shop called Sol & Vita. He continued to publish a number of spiritual works, like Onze overheerlijke lotsbestemming, het Paradijs (Paradise, our marvellous destiny, in Dutch).

Biography Archibald Campbell was the eldest son of Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll (died 1529) and Lady Jean Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly. Immediately after succeeding as Earl of Argyll and to the offices of his father, in October 1529, he was put in command of an expedition to quell an insurrection in the southern Scottish Isles. The voluntary submission of the main chiefs resulted; and Alexander MacDonald of Dunnyveg, a prime mover in the insurrection, was able to convince King James V of Scotland that he was personally well disposed to the government. More than that, MacDonald argued that the disturbances in the Isles were chiefly because the Earls of Argyll had made use of the office of lieutenant over the Isles, for their own personal aggrandizement. Archibald was therefore summoned before the King to give an account of the duties and rental of the Isles, received by him; and, as the result of the inquiry, he was committed for a time to prison. Shortly afterwards, he was liberated, but was deprived of his offices, and they were not restored to him until after the death of King James V. In a charter of 28 April 1542, Archibald Campbell was called \\"master of the king's wine cellar\\". Along with the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Moray, he was named one of the Council of the Scottish Monarchy in the document which Cardinal Beaton produced as the will of King James V, and which also appointed Beaton governor of the Kingdom and guardian to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, daughter and heir of King James. After the arrest of Beaton, on 20 January 1543, Archibald retired to his own lands to muster a force inorder to maintain the struggle against James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, who had been chosen governor. Shortly afterwards, the Earls of Argyll, Huntly, Moray, and the Earl of Bothwell, supported by many of the barons and landed gentry, as well as by the bishops and abbots, assembled at Perth, vowing their determination to resist the measures of the governor. On being summoned by the governor to disperse, they did not resist; but when it became known that King Henry VIII of England had succeeded in arranging a treaty of marriage between the young queen Mary and his son, Prince Edward Tudor, the Earls of Argyll, Huntly, Bothwell, and Lennox marched from Stirling with a force of ten thousand men, and compelled the governor to surrender to their charge, the infant Queen, with whom they returned to Stirling. In the summer of 1544, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, who had joined over to the party of King Henry VIII, plundered the Isle of Arran, and made himself master of the Isle of Bute and Rothesay Castle, with the support of eighteen ships and 800 men supplied by King Henry. As he sailed down the River Clyde, he was fired on by Archibald, who with four thousand men occupied Dunoon Castle. After a consultation with his English officers, Lennox attacked Dunoon Castle, as well as burning the nearby village and church. Sustaining great loss, Archibald was driven out of the castle. Lennox subsequently then laid waste a large part of Kintyre, but as he had not succeeded in regaining possession of his stronghold, Dumbarton Castle, Lennox retreated to his ships and sailed for England around 28 May 1544. Later, on the forfeiture of the estates of Lennox, Archibald was rewarded with the largest share. Although Lennox continued to arouse discontent in the Isles, the practical result of his actions only increased the power of the Earl of Argyll. At the Battle of Pinkie, on 10 September 1547, the Earl of Argyll, with four thousand west Highlanders, held command of the right wing of the Scottish army. In January 1548, he advanced to Dundee to capture Broughty Castle; but English negotiators deterred him, even if he denied the rumours that he favored England and had been bought off. At the siege of Haddington, he was made \\"Knight of the Cockle\\" by King Henry II of France, at the same time as the Earls of Angus and Huntly. Argyll wrote to Mary of Guise from Dunstaffnage Castle on 12 August 1554 after receiving her instructions to suppress rebellion in the Western Isles. He would proceed towards Mull and meet up with James McConnell and MacLaine, and Salabous, the Captain of Dunbar, had brought his soldiers.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 388-9. Archibald Campbell had come under the influence of John Knox and the Scottish Reformation. On his way to Geneva in 1556, Knox stayed with him at Castle Campbell. After the agreement of the barons, in December 1557, that the reformed preachers should teach in private houses till the government should allow them to preach in public, Archibald took on the protection of John Douglas, a Carmelite friar. To induce Archibald to renounce the reformed faith, John Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrews, sent him a long letter, to which he wrote a detailed answer. Archibald Campbell died between 21 August 1558 and 2 December 1558 in Dulnynn, Scotland. He was buried at Kilmun Parish Church in Cowal, Scotland. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son, also named Archibald Campbell. Family Archibald Campbell was married three times. He was married firstly to Lady Helen Hamilton (died in or before 1541), daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran and Janet Bethune. cites and They had a son: *Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll *Lady Janet Campbell, who married Calvagh O'Donnell, Lord of Tyrconnell.Many popular accounts of the family of Calvagh O'Donnell (c. 1515-1566) confuse the identities of his wives and their relationships to the Earls of Argyll. Calvagh's first known wife, however, was definitely a sister of the 5th Earl, and therefore a daughter of the 4th Earl. \\"Calendar of the State Papers Relating to Ireland of the Reign(s) of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth\\", originally published in 1860, Vol. 1, page 159.

WPP has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. On 14 April 2018, Martin Sorrell retired 33 years after founding the company. Roberto Quarta is chairman. Mark Read is CEO. History The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake. During 1986, WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory and production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory and stopped manufacturing Picquotware: all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.Piquotware History In the 1980s, WPP began its strategy of growth via acquisitions. In later years, WPP regularly acquired dozens of companies annually. In January 1987, the company acquired Scott Stern Associates, at the time Scotland's largest design and advertising company. In the same year (1987), the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill & Knowlton and MRB Group) for $566m. The company listed on the NASDAQ in 1988 (and later switched its secondary listing to the NYSE). In 1989, it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m. WPP's acquisitions continued into the 1990s, when WPP bought firms in the healthcare advertising, digital- marketing, online shopping, digital media, data management, retail and corporate consultancy, and sports-marketing industries. This included the 1999 acquisition of Lambie-Nairn. In 1998, WPP formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan. In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States-based Young & Rubicam Group for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector. The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic. In the 2000s, WPP Digital was created to develop the group's digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for ¬£1.6 billion. During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession. In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million. In November 2015, WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency. In November 2016, WPP announced it will be acquiring PEP, LLC, a project management and procurement company that oversees shopper marketing promotions for clients, in the US. Many of WPP's constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was among those hit by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff's computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later. WPP merged Burson-Marsteller with Cohn & Wolfe to become BCW (Burson Cohn & Wolfe) in February 2018. In April 2018, Martin Sorrell retired after 33 years, following allegations of personal misconduct and misuse of company assets. Sorrell has denied the allegations. Chairman Roberto Quarta was temporarily named executive chairman. In September 2018, Mark Read, who was global CEO of Wunderman, was named CEO. In the late 2010s, the advertising industry faced significant challenges. Changes in the industry landscape included financial pressure on global clients, in particular fast-moving consumer goods clients, companies taking work in-house, ability to directly advertise on tech platforms, and competition with consultancies. While WPP had previously outperformed other companies in the industry, its growth slowed starting in 2017 and its market value dropped in 2018. Critics said WPP needed to become \\"nimbler\\" and \\"leaner\\". At the time, many WPP agencies operated mostly independently and competed for accounts. In late 2018, Read said the company had grown \\"unwieldy with too much duplication\\". He instituted a plan to reposition WPP as a \\"creative transformation company\\" and make its offer simpler. Read emphasized the importance of technology and also merged several WPP agencies: J. Walter Thompson merged with Wunderman to create Wunderman Thompson and Y&R; merged with VML to create VMLY&R.; Within Read's first year as CEO, he trimmed WPP by selling more than 30 subsidiaries, including a majority stake in Kantar. By selling a majority stake of Kantar to Bain Capital, WPP is believed to have generated $3.1 billion to help pay down debt. Read also sold the original Wire and Plastic Products company that Sorrell had purchased to create his business empire. The sale of 60% of Kantar was completed in December 2019. $1.9bn was used to reduce WPP‚Äôs debt, and $1.2bn was returned to shareholders. Operations WPP is a large holding company involved in communications, advertising, public relations, and other businesses. It is considered the world's biggest advertising agency group. WPP focuses on communications, experience, commerce, and technology. Headquartered in London, England, WPP has approximately 130,000 employees throughout its portfolio of businesses across more than 100 countries, as of 2018. WPP's notable advertising agency company holdings include Grey, Ogilvy, VMLY&R;, and Wunderman Thompson. WPP's digital company holdings include AKQA. WPP's public relations and public affairs company holdings include Hill+Knowlton Strategies, BCW (Burson Cohn & Wolfe), and Ogilvy. WPP's media investment management company holdings include GroupM, Mindshare, Wavemaker and Essence. WPP's research insight and consulting companies include Kantar. Hogarth Worldwide is a WPP-owned production company. WPP's shopper marketing promotions company is PEP, LLC (formerly Promotion Execution Partners). WPP-owned brand consultancies include Superunion (a combination of Brand Union, Lambie-Nairn, and three other brand consulting businesses) and Landor. Controversies 2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies' AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell's intended ¬£12.93m compensation package drew increasing public attention in 2012. The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution. Taxation It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. The Guardian reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid ¬£27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper \\"might expect\\" based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around ¬£126m. Television Audience Measurement In 2012, the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. The lawsuit alleged that viewership data were manipulated in favor of broadcasters willing to provide bribes. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB. The lawsuit was dismissed in its entirety on 4 March 2013.

Savage is a book (published in 1992 and reprinted in 1994 with an introduction by Arthur C. Clarke) in the field of exploratory engineering that gives a series of concrete stages the author believes will lead to interstellar colonization. Many specific scientific and engineering details are presented, as are numerous issues involved in space colonization. The book's thesis Savage takes a Malthusian view of the exponential growth of human population and life in general, and also recommends the exponential growth of blue-green algae for sustenance. He states that it is humanity's manifest destiny to colonize every star in the galaxy. He draws heavily on the Fermi paradox (briefly stated as, \\"If there is intelligent life in space, why haven't we found it yet?\\") to support his position that it is humanity's burden alone to ignite the universe with the \\"spark of Life.\\" In The Millennial Project, he calls for the creation of an international foundation to realize these goals. Originally known as the First Millennial Foundation (founded by Savage in 1987), the organization changed its name to the Living Universe Foundation. The steps of the project The \\"Eight Easy Steps\\" proposed by Savage are as follows: # Foundationconstitute an organization convened to realize these destinies. # Aquariusbuild arcologies in the tropical oceans as a first step to learning how to build (\\"grow\\"Savage, Marshall T., The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps, 2nd edition, 1994, p 73) colonies in space using a method not unlike that used by living coralsHilbertz, W.

In the early stages of the Project, Savage recommends Spirulina algae as a primary foodstuff, supplemented by seafood mariculture from the cities of the Aquarius phase. The Living Universe Foundation, previously known as the First Millennial Foundation, is an organization that supports ocean and space colonization more or less based upon the book The Millennial Project. Space Environments Ecovillage in Bastrop, Texas, is one of the few LUF projects that have materialized so far. Criticisms The book has drawn some criticism in that while it is replete with details concerning OTEC construction and space colonization, it touches very little on the subject of how governments and societies will need to change to enact the Project. Defenders and the author himselfSavage, Marshall T., The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps, 2nd edition, 1994, p 363 maintain that one man writing one book cannot be expected to write out the entire course of human development over the next millennium, and that others more suited to the field of social psychology will be needed for the Project's completion.

Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier in the Confederate military. Biography Benavides was born in Laredo, a descendant of Tom√°s S√°nchez de la Barrera y Garza, the founder of Laredo, as well as the descendant of Captain Francisco Baez De Benavides, born in the Canary Islands and a Portuguese early colonist of Northern Mexico. Benavides was elected Mayor of Laredo in 1856 and then became Webb County Judge in 1859.Jerry Thompson, \\"BENAVIDES, SANTOS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed May 28, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. He was a Captain of the 33rd Texas Cavalry, also called Benavides' Regiment, until he was promoted to Colonel in November 1863. Colonel Santos Benavides in Laredo actually became the highest ranking tejano officer in the Confederate Army. There are instances of him acting as a slave catcher, where he‚Äôs actually going into Mexico and retrieving runaway slaves and returning them to their masters, for which he was compensated. On May 22, 1861, at the Battle of Carrizo (also called Battle of Zapata), Benavides engaged the local Tejano leader Juan Cortina (who had invaded Zapata County, an event usually referred as the Second Cortina War), and drove him back into Mexico. Probably his greatest contribution to the Confederacy was securing passage of Confederate cotton to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, in 1863. Due to the Union blockade of ports along the Gulf of Mexico, shipping cotton to Mexico was one of the few ways the Confederacy was able to earn needed cash. On March 18, 1864, Major Alfred Holt led a force of about two hundred men of the Union First Texas Cavalry who were stationed near Brownsville, Texas under the command of Colonel Edmund J. Davis, who had earlier offered Benavides a Union generalship. Their mission was to destroy five thousand bales of cotton stacked at the San Agust√≠n Plaza in Laredo. Colonel Benavides commanded forty- two men and repelled three Union attacks at the Zacate Creek in what is known as the Battle of Laredo.Webb County Heritage Foundation; War on the Rio Grande In May 1865, Benavides' regiment participated in the last land battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Palmito Ranch After the American Civil War ended, he resumed his merchant and ranching activities and remained active in politics.

Originally named the Second Narrows Bridge, it connects Vancouver to the North Shore of Burrard Inlet, which includes the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. It was constructed adjacent to the older Second Narrows Bridge, which is now exclusively a rail bridge. Its construction, from 1956 to 1960, was marred by a multi-death collapse on June 17, 1958. The First Narrows Bridge, better known as Lions Gate Bridge, crosses Burrard Inlet about west of the Second Narrows. The bridge is a steel truss cantilever bridge, designed by Swan Wooster Engineering Co. Ltd. Construction began in November 1957, and the bridge was officially opened on August 25, 1960. It cost approximately $15 million to build. Tolls were charged until 1963. The bridge is long with a centre span of . It is part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). Collapse Collapsed spans, August 1958 On June 17, 1958, as a crane stretched from the north side of the new bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch, several spans collapsed. Seventy-nine workers plunged into the water. Eighteen were killed either instantly or shortly thereafter, possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts. A diver searching for bodies drowned later, bringing the total fatalities for the collapse to nineteen. In a subsequent Royal Commission inquiry, the bridge collapse was attributed to miscalculation by bridge engineers. A temporary arm, holding the fifth anchor span, was deemed too light to bear the weight. Renaming The bridge was renamed the \\"Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing\\" in 1994 to honour the eighteen workers who died in the collapse, along with one rescue diver and four other workers who also died during the construction process. In popular culture Stompin' Tom Connors paid a musical tribute to the fallen ironworkers with the song \\"The Bridge Came Tumbling Down\\" on his 1972 album My Stompin' Grounds. (This tune also appears on several later compilations one of which was performed by Les Claypool's Duo de Twang). Jimmy Dean's 1962 song \\"Steel Men\\" is a ballad about the Second Narrows bridge disaster. Gary Geddes' 2007 book of poetry, entitled Falsework, is based on the collapse of the bridge.

Known for its broad mix of cultures and activities, Adams Morgan contains together both residential and entertainment areas, and has a vibrant nightlife with numerous bars and restaurants, particularly along 18th Street NW. Columbia Road also holds a busy stretch of shops and businesses.Adams Morgan DC Neighborhood Guide‚ÄîCompass. As a distinct, named area, Adams Morgan came into being in the late 1950s, when it drew together several smaller and older neighborhoods that were first developed in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries. It is today composed primarily of well- made rowhouses; and classically-styled mid-rise apartment buildings, many of which are now co-ops and condos; along with various commercial structures. Adams Morgan is bounded: *to the south, by Florida Avenue NW and the Dupont Circle neighborhood *to the southwest, by Connecticut Avenue NW and Kalorama- Sheridan *to the north, by Harvard St. and Mount Pleasant * to the east, by 16th Street NW and Columbia Heights Reed-Cooke is a sub-neighborhood of Adams- Morgan, consisting of the easternmost area between Columbia Road and Florida avenue.  History  Before the colony of Maryland was established in 1632, the area of today's neighborhood was home to the American Indian, Nacotchtank tribe. Robert Peter and Anthony Holmead, two prominent colonial-era landowners, held the land beneath Adams Morgan when the District of Columbia was created in 1791. At that time, these local tracts sat just above the original planned City of Washington, and were either undeveloped or only lightly farmed. As the population of D.C. expanded, this land was divided into several estates purchased by wealthy residents, including Meridian Hill, Cliffbourne, Holt House, Oak Lawn, Henderson Castle, a part of Kalorama, and the horse farm of William Thornton.Meridian Hill: A History, by Stephen McKevitt (History Press, 2014), pg. 123. After the Civil War, these estates were subdivided and the area slowly grew. Once the city's overall-layout plans were finalized in the 1890s, these various subdivisions, using modern construction techniques, developed more rapidly, and the area of Adams Morgan then grew into several attractive and largely upper- and middle-class neighborhoods. In the 20th century, the area was home to a range of people, from the very wealthy living along 16th Street, to white-collar professionals in Lanier Heights, to blue-collar residents east of 18th Street NW. Residents comprised all classes and a mix of races, though segregated. After World War II, the modern development of the nation continued, and racial desegregation began. When D.C. was formally desegregated, some whites abruptly left the area, other whites stayed and worked to integrate the neighborhood, and some African Americans and Hispanics moved into the area. The neighborhood, along with the city, was evolving. The area, with its less costly housing, also became home to some artists and social activists. The name Adams Morgan, once hyphenated, is derived from the names of two formerly segregated area elementary schools‚Äîthe older, all-black Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School (now defunct) and the all-white John Quincy Adams Elementary School. Pursuant to the 1954 Bolling v. Sharpe Supreme Court ruling, district schools were desegregated in 1955. The Adams-Morgan Community Council, comprising both Adams and Morgan schools and the neighborhoods they served, formed in 1958 to implement progressively this desegregation. The city drew boundaries of the neighborhood through four existing neighborhoods‚ÄîWashington Heights, Lanier Heights, Kalorama Triangle, and Meridian Hill‚Äînaming the resulting area after both schools. Since its formation in the 1950s, Adams Morgan and its community have stood for social justice, political activism, and inclusive, progressive values. Nearby All Souls Unitarian Church, the Potter's House cafe and bookstore, and Meridian Hill Park have all served as gathering places for activists dedicated to social change, and also function as civic centers of the greater community. In the late 1960s, a group of residents organized and worked with city officials to plan and construct a new elementary school and recreational complex that was conceived as a community hub, a concept that 40 years later has become a standard in public school facilities design. The development was named the Marie H. Reed Learning Center after the minister and civic leader. It featured a daycare center, tennis and basketball courts, a solar-heated swimming pool, health clinic, athletic field and outdoor chess tables. Since the 1990s, Adams Morgan has seen an influx of new residents, as more people are continuing, in general, to move into urban centers. New housing is being constructed‚Äîsome new infill-construction, some developments that use repurposed structures, and some new construction that is replacing older industrial buildings in parts of the Meridian Hill area. Some of these new and redeveloped apartment buildings are being constructed along 16th Street NW. The new residents include a mix of young professionals and older people returning from the suburbs. From 2010 to 2012, the city reconstructed 18th Street NW, one of the neighborhood's main commercial corridors, with wider sidewalks, more crosswalks and bicycle arrows, resulting in a more pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare. Additionally, the Adams Morgan Partnership Business Improvement District (AMPBID) has been active in the community since 2005; its stated mission is to promote a clean, friendly and safe Adams Morgan.Adams Morgan Partnership Business Improvement District. Currently it sponsors local events such as summer concerts and holiday decorations, and provides helpful information to the area residents. Cultural diversity Along with its adjacent sister communities to the north and east, Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights, Adams Morgan long has been a gateway community for immigrants. Since the 1960s, the predominant international presence in both communities has been Latino, with the majority of immigrants coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and other Central American countries. Since the early 1970s, like other areas of the nation, Adams Morgan had seen a growing influx of immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, as well. Gentrification and the resulting higher cost of housing, however, have displaced many immigrants and long-time African American residents, particularly those with young children, as well as many small businesses, but the community still retains a degree of diversity, most evident in its array of international shops and restaurants. Since 1980, the population of the neighborhood has not changed (increasing marginally from 15,352 to 15,630) while average real annual household income more than doubled from $72,753 to $172,249 (in 2010 $) and diversity has decreased shifting from 51% to 68% White Non-Hispanic. Shops located along 18th Street NW in Adams Morgan Aerial view of 18th Street NW Adams Morgan also has become a thriving spot for nightlife, with several bars and clubs featuring live music. Over 90 establishments possess liquor licenses, putting it on level with other popular nightlife areas like Georgetown and Dupont Circle. Nightlife establishments rapidly replaced local stores along 18th Street NW, leading the Alcohol Beverage Control Board to impose a moratorium on new liquor licenses in 2000 after successful lobbying by resident groups. The moratorium was renewed in 2004, but eased to allow new restaurant licenses. Despite the exodus of many immigrant, and also African- American, residents from Adams Morgan because of costlier housing, a nexus of long-time institutions, many established specifically to meet the needs of Latinos and other non-English-speaking residents, continues to serve as a magnet for immigrants and their families. Within Adams Morgan is Mary's Center, a clinic focusing on healthcare delivery to Spanish-speaking patients, and the Latino Economic Development Corporation, and numerous businesses and churches that employ and cater to immigrants. Adjacent Mt. Pleasant also hosts a number of commercial enterprises, social service agencies and other institutions that help to anchor local immigrants to the area. Another barometer of the enduring pull of Adams Morgan for immigrants is the linguistic and cultural diversity of its public schools. Many of the families served live beyond the boundaries established for routine student enrollment; however, Adams, Reed, and H.D. Cooke elementary schools all have international populations, with children from well over 30 nations in attendance. Latino and African-American children comprise the majority of students in the public schools. A man dressed up at Adams Morgan Day Festival in 2013 The annual Adams Morgan Day Festival is held in September. Lively music often accompanies Adams Morgan Day festivals. The second Sunday of September, the neighborhood hosts the Adams Morgan Day Festival, a multicultural street celebration with live music and food and crafts booths. Weather permitting, every Saturday‚Äîexcept during the coldest winter months‚Äîlocal growers sell fresh, organically grown produce and herbs, baked and canned goods, cheeses, cold- pressed apple juice, and fresh flowers at the farmers market, in operation in the same location on a plaza at the corner of 18th Street NW and Columbia Road for more than 30 years. In the 1960s, the neighborhood's attractions included the Avignon Freres bakery and restaurant (closed in the 1990s), the Caf√© Don restaurant, the Ontario motion picture theater, and the Showboat Lounge jazz nightclub. In the 1980s, Hazel's featured live blues and jazz, and its soul food offerings made it a favorite of black jazz musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie when they came to town. In September 2014, the American Planning Association named Adams Morgan one of the nation's \\"great neighborhoods\\", citing its intact Victorian rowhouses, murals, international diversity, and pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly streetscape. Transportation Adams Morgan map with some transportation icons. The area is not directly served by the Metrorail system. The station nearest the heart of Adams Morgan, Woodley Park, is in the Woodley Park neighborhood, but was renamed \\"Woodley Park‚ÄìZoo/Adams Morgan\\" in 1999 to reflect the station's proximity to Adams Morgan. The station was renamed \\"Woodley Park\\" with \\"Zoo/Adams Morgan\\" as a subtitle in 2011. The southernmost parts of the neighborhood below Rock Creek Park are closer to the Dupont Circle station. In March 2009, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) began operating a DC Circulator bus route connecting the center of Adams Morgan with both Metro stations. The area is also served by a number of WMATA Metrobus lines, including the 42, 43, 90, 92, 96, H1, L2, S2, and S9.

She was launched in 1901 and sunk in 1917. Construction and design Chauncey was laid down at Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 2 December 1899 as a member of the Bainbridge class, and was launched on 26 October 1901. Chauncey was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . As the Bainbridge class was intended to be more seaworthy than the US Navy's torpedo boats, the ship had a raised forecastle instead of the \\"turtleback\\" forecastle common in European designs. Design displacement was and full load, although all ships of the class were overweight. Four Thornycroft boilers fed steam at to triple expansion steam engines rated at driving two shafts for a design speed of . Four funnels were fitted. Armament consisted of two /50 caliber guns, five 6-pounder () guns and two torpedo tubes. Chauncey was placed in reduced commission on 20 November 1902, then placed in reserve on 2 December 1902 and received full commission on 21 February 1903. Lieutenant Stanford Elwood Moses was placed in command and Chauncey reported to the Atlantic Fleet. Pre-World War I Chauncey served with the Coast Squadron until 20 September 1903, when she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet and left Key West for the Orient on 18 December. After sailing by way of the Suez Canal, she arrived at Cavite to join the force representing US interest in the Far East as it cruised in the Philippines during winters and off China during summers. Aside from the period of 3 December 1905 ‚Äì 12 January 1907, when she was in reserve at Cavite, Chauncey continued this service until the entrance of America into World War I. Sinking The destroyer sailed from Cavite on 1 August 1917 for convoy escort duty in the eastern Atlantic, based at St. Nazaire, France.

The bridge's south end connects directly to the Thornton Tunnel, which connects it to the main Canadian rail network. As the name suggests, it is located at the second narrowing of the Burrard Inlet. History Background During the Klondike Gold Rush, there were schemes to build a railway from Vancouver to the Dawson gold fields. The first stage in this would be to bridge Burrard Inlet and then build a railway north. John Hendry floated the Vancouver, Westminster, and Yukon Railway which built a line from Ladner to New Westminster and then to Vancouver via Burnaby Lake. This line was paired with the Great Northern Railway who also wanted trackage into Vancouver. In the process, various other railroads all became involved in the bridging scheme: the Canadian Northern Railway, Milwaukee Road, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. The bridge itself would be owned by the Federal Government as they had control of harbours and shipping, and would lease access to the railways as they did with the rail bridge in New Westminster. One of the main reasons was that there was very little space on the south shore for wharves, thus railways wanted to develop the North Shore as the south side was occupied by another railway, the Canadian Pacific. A company was floated, the Burrard Inlet Bridge and Tunnel Company, and contracts were issued to span the tidal bore. At one point, a causeway was planned to dam the narrows and create bridges and wharves that way. World War I intervened, as did the bankruptcy of all the interested railways. With it went dreams of the bridge and rails up Indian Arm, the Capilano valley, or via Howe Sound. However, the predecessor railways did sign contracts to build a bridge and a new Hotel Vancouver. Only after the war with huge increase in funding to improve harbours around the British Empire, partly due to problems associated with wartime shipping, did funds appear for the completion of the 1925 bridge. And so the north shore port became an amalgam of operations with Canadian National, Pacific Great Eastern and Harbour and Wharves Commission all using the bridge when it was not out of service. North Vancouver ferries operated at this time as well. The essential wartime shipyards in North Vancouver underscored the need for reliable industrial access. Further, the expansion of Lynnterm, Wheat elevators, coal and the sulphur port in the 1960s indicated the growing use of the North Shore. Original bridge (1925) The original Second Narrows Bridge was constructed in 1925, and was the first bridge to connect Vancouver with the North Shore over the tidal bore of the narrows. This bridge was constructed, by John Stewart and Northern Construction, with a car deck and a year later in 1926 trains began using the bridge as well. After being hit by a number of ships and being out of service for 4 years, in 1933 the provincial government bought the bridge and installed a lift section of the deck. In 1960, a new much larger and higher 6-lane Second Narrows Bridge with a span was completed alongside the original bridge, and the original bridge was converted exclusively for rail use. In 1994, the new road bridge was renamed the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing in honour of the ironworkers who died in accidents while building it. However, the new bridge is still commonly referred to as the Second Narrows Bridge. The bridge when raised Second bridge (1968) In 1968, the original 1926 railbridge was replaced by CN Rail with a larger, higher lift bridge. A bridgetender activates cables and counterweights to raise the span. Unless moving a train across Burrard Inlet, the lift section is always in the up position to allow ships to go underneath. The current bridge has a vertical clearance of at the main lift span fully raised (open position). The vertical lift section of the Second Narrows Railway Bridge provides clear navigation width between rubbing fenders. However, the Ironworkers Second Narrows road bridge has a vertical clearance of and the shipping channel where the maximum vertical clearance is available is wide.

It was created by Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco and produced by Williams Street, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment. The name is a portmanteau of the words \\"cartoon\\" and \\"tsunami\\". It currently broadcasts every Saturday night from 12 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. ET/PT. Toonami initially ran as a weekday afternoon block on Cartoon Network until 2004, when it transitioned into a Saturday evening format until its closure four years later. Cartoon Network's block was primarily aimed at children aged 9‚Äì14. In its original run from 1997 to 2008, the block was known for showcasing action oriented animation, with heavy focus on Japanese animation, which became widely popular with American audiences. Toonami is recognized for its distinctive space- themed backdrop, anime music videos, drum and bass-flavored soundtrack, and its robot host named T.O.M. (short for Toonami Operations Module). On May 26, 2012, Toonami was relaunched as a late night block on Adult Swim. The current incarnation is a rebrand of Adult Swim's Saturday night action block (itself inherited from Toonami's Midnight Run block), which primarily airs mature Japanese animation.  Broadcast History   Cartoon Network (1997‚Äì2000)  = 1997‚Äì1999: Moltar era = Toonami was Cartoon Network's primary action-animation block. The block premiered on March 17, 1997. It initially replaced Power Zone, Cartoon Network's most recent incarnation of the Super Adventures block, which had been a staple on the network since its debut on October 1, 1992. Toonami was originally a weekday afternoon cartoon and action block hosted by Space Ghost villain-turned-producer Moltar (voiced by C. Martin Croker) at the Ghost Planet Industries building from March 17, 1997 to July 9, 1999. = 1999‚Äì2000: T.O.M. 1 era = On Saturday, July 10, 1999, Cartoon Network relaunched Toonami with a new environment, the Ghost Planet Spaceship Absolution, and a new host, a robot named T.O.M. (voiced by Sonny Strait), which introduced viewers to him with this speech: Also introduced that day was the Midnight Run, a late night block. It was originally a five- hour Saturday night block (technically Sunday) at midnight EST until March 2000, when it moved to weeknights in an hour-long format until January 2003. It consisted of anime such as Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Voltron, Robotech, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, and Outlaw Star. Midnight Run tended to have more blood and violence than its daytime counterpart, even running an uncut version of Gundam Wing between March and November 2000. One special edition that started on Friday, August 31, 2001, featured music videos such as ‚ÄúClint Eastwood‚Äù by Gorillaz, and songs by Daft Punk from their 2001 album Discovery, the music videos of which constitute the 2003 Japanese-French musical Interstella 5555, and Kenna's \\"Hellbent‚Äù. Another event was Dragon Ball Z taking over the Midnight Run for a week starting on March 26‚Äì30, 2001. Starting in September 2000, Toonami presented special interactive events known as Total Immersion Events (TIEs). These TIEs took place both on-air during Toonami and online at the official site, Toonami.com, and always occurred the week that the block's most popular series, Dragon Ball Z, returned for a new season. The first TIE was The Intruder, which introduced T.O.M.'s companion, an AI matrix known as Sara (voiced by country singer \\"Cowboy\\" Sally Timms.) The Intruder was an eight episode mini-series that aired during Toonami from September 18‚Äì22, 2000. It involved the Absolution being attacked by an alien blob known only as \\"the Intruder\\", which ultimately devoured T.O.M. = 2000‚Äì2003: T.O.M. 2 era = Toonami logo used from February 21, 2000 to March 14, 2003; revived in 2017 for its 20th anniversary Though The Intruder resulted in the destruction of T.O.M., he was soon after upgraded by S.A.R.A. from a short Bomberman-esque character to a taller, sleeker, deeper-voiced incarnation dubbed T.O.M. 2 (voiced by Steven Blum, who has since been the voice of all subsequent incarnations of the character). A Saturday morning incarnation, Toonami Rising Sun, ran from 2000 to 2001 at 9:00 am to noon. It later ran from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, then 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. This block was somewhat hampered to avoid competing with sister network Kids' WB. From July 30, 2001, until June 28, 2002, Kids' WB (also owned by Time Warner) aired a Toonami block that was, more or less, the Kids' WB lineup with the Toonami name. It was critically panned by industry observers, who noticed that the action branding of the block - which had added shows such as Generation O!, Scooby-Doo, and The Nightmare Room, a live-action series created by Goosebumps author R. L. Stine - did not translate content-wise. In spring 2002, Kids' WB announced that they would drop the Toonami name from their weekday lineup, once again making the Toonami brand exclusive to Cartoon Network. The TIE, Lockdown, aired between September 17‚Äì21, 2001, and included the introduction of CartoonNetwork.com's first MMORPG, as well as a record-breaking amount of page views and ratings for the network. In Lockdown T.O.M. fights to save the Absolution from an attack by a giant trash compactor. Trapped in Hyperspace, the next TIE, ran the week of September 16‚Äì20, 2002. Sara gets taken offline by a computer virus named Swayzak (whose voice actor is unknown but is speculated to be Khary Payton), and TOM is trapped in hyperspace. He manages to defeat Swayzak before the Absolution hits Earth. The game tie-in for this event is lost. During the week of February 24‚Äì28, 2003, Cartoon Network aired on Toonami \\"Giant Robot Week,\\" a five-day special based on mecha series, which were licensed by A.D. Vision. The series shown were Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gigantor, Robotech, Martian Successor Nadesico, and Dai-Guard. On May 15, 2001, Cartoon Network released Toonami: Deep Space Bass, the official soundtrack album to the TV block. = 2003‚Äì2007: T.O.M. 3 era = In March 2003, TOM was revamped into a more muscular figure. This was explained in- universe as him being rebuilt after fighting a space pirate. His voice also became more humanlike. In September 2003, a mini series premiered introducing a new, 2D universe. Immortal Grand Prix (IGPX), created by Toonami producers Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco, and produced by anime studio Production I.G, aired in five short installments, serving as a pilot for the second Toonami original series, which premiered in November 2005. On April 17, 2004, Toonami was moved from weekday afternoons to a Saturday evening slot, where it aired regularly for four hours starting at 7:00 pm EST. A new lighter-toned action block, Miguzi, to weekdays in its place. Toonami also replaced the block known as Saturday Video Entertainment System (SVES). One reason for the move from weekdays to Saturday nights was because some of the shows on the weekday lineup became too violent for a weekday broadcast on the network. The new Toonami lineup showcased anime such as Naruto, Rave Master, Duel Masters, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, One Piece, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Zatch Bell, and Pok√©mon Chronicles, as well as premiered North American productions including Teen Titans, Megas XLR, Justice League Unlimited, and IGPX, Toonami's first and only original production co-produced by Production I.G and Bandai Entertainment. Sara got a full body during this period, and became more anime- esque, along with her voice actress being changed to British actress and Red Dwarf star Samantha Robson. Although Megas XLR was the first original American-made franchise to actually debut on the block, it was initially a Cartoon Network original that was planned to air on Friday nights. Other Cartoon Network action properties, namely Samurai Jack, Teen Titans, and Justice League, aired on Toonami, but were not exclusive to the block until their final seasons. = 2007‚Äì2008: T.O.M. 4 era and cancellation = On January 27, 2007, a teaser commercial aired during the Xiaolin Showdown marathon on Cartoon Network, featuring closeup shots of larger Clydes (the remote robot explorers that have been a fixture of Toonami since the beginning) and two new robot A.I's along with the date \\"3/17/07\\" and T.O.M.'s chest emblem glowing blue. On March 17, Toonami celebrated its 10th anniversary with a new packaging and numerous montages celebrating the block. T.O.M. was revamped into a shorter robot, who was a commander of a jungle control room and aided by two new robots, Flash (Dave Wittenberg) and D (Tom Kenny). The montages included a look at past hosts, former logos, and a decade's worth of clips and voice-overs from shows that aired on Toonami. There were a total of four montages, each with different clips, and three were one minute long. As part of the anniversary (and to coincide with Cartoon Network's March Movie Madness event), Toonami planned another month of movies: * March 3 ‚Äì The Invincible Iron Man * March 10 ‚Äì Mosaic * March 17 ‚Äì Hellboy: Blood and Iron * March 24 ‚Äì Stan Lee Presents: The Condor * March 31 ‚Äì Spirited Away and Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo On September 20, 2008, at the Anime Weekend Atlanta convention in Atlanta, Georgia, Cartoon Network announced that they had cancelled the Toonami block due to low ratings. Toonami then aired its final broadcast later that same evening. The final show to air on the block was a rerun of Samurai Jack at 10:30 PM. Employees who worked on the block moved to other parts of the channel, except for Dennis Moloney, who left Turner to work for Disney. Toonami Jetstream remained with the Toonami name until January 30, 2009. At the end of Toonami's final airing, T.O.M. 4 ended the block with a brief, final monologue, backed by the song \\"Cascade\\" by Tycho: After Toonami's final episode on TV, Toonami Jetstream's subsequent shut down in 2009 marked the end of this incarnation until the brand's revival in 2012.  Adult Swim (2012‚Äìpresent)  = 2012‚Äì2013: T.O.M. 3.5 era = On April 1, 2012, Adult Swim aired the Toonami block for their annual April Fools' Day prank, in which would be the annual airing of The Room. After airing that week's scheduled episode of Bleach, the Toonami- related programming continued throughout the night, featuring shows such as Dragon Ball Z, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Tenchi Muyo!, Outlaw Star, The Big O, Yu Yu Hakusho, Blue Submarine No. 6, Trigun, Astro Boy (1963), and Gigantor. The following day, Adult Swim posted a message to their Twitter page, simply stating, \\"Want it back? Let us know. #BringBackToonami\\". On April 4, Adult Swim followed up this tweet with one stating, \\"#BringBackToonami We've heard you. Thank you for your passion and interest - stay tuned.\\" On April 8, Adult Swim aired two bumpers about the Toonami tweets and answered with \\"[we're listening]\\" and \\"[we're looking into it]\\". On May 16, Adult Swim posted a message on Facebook announcing that Toonami would return on May 26. The network issued a press release later that day confirming the block's revival as a Saturday late-night action block. Toonami made its return on May 26, with an initial lineup consisting of current Adult Swim Action programs, along with premieres of Deadman Wonderland and Casshern Sins. On August 18, Samurai 7 and Eureka Seven replaced Deadman Wonderland and Cowboy Bebop. In essence, the revived block is very similar to the Midnight Run of the original, airing uncut programming as well as having more mature themes. On October 6, Toonami expanded to a full six hours; Sym-Bionic Titan and ThunderCats were added to the block. Tenchi Muyo! GXP was announced as the next premiere on November 3, as was the return of Inuyasha. On November 22, Toonami announced they would air uncut episodes of Naruto, and confirmed that Bleach would enter reruns for eight weeks, beginning on December 1. On January 6, 2013, Toonami introduced a new blue color scheme, after using a similar scheme to introduce Inuyasha on November 3 of the previous year. New episodes of Bleach began on January 26. On February 16, Soul Eater began airing on Toonami, replacing Samurai 7. During MomoCon, new designs for both T.O.M and the Absolution were unveiled, along with the announcement that overall design of the block would be changed. = 2013‚Äì2019: T.O.M. 5 era = On April 27, 2013 Toonami premiered its new look, featuring the return of supporting host Sara (now voiced by Adult Swim staff member Dana Swanson.) To kick off 2014, Toonami premiered the anime Space Dandy on January 4, even before Japan. The anime ran for two seasons and 26 episodes before ending that September. The block introduced a new aesthetic on April 6. This new look also featured the return of the Ninja Tune record label to Toonami. Intruder II, the first Total Immersion Event since Toonami's 2012 revival, began on November 7 and concluded on December 20, 2015 with Sonny Strait reprising his role as Invader with Steve Blum, who also is the invader and TOM 5. On December 2, Adult Swim announced that a new season of Samurai Jack was being produced. It ended up premiering on Toonami in March 2017. The conclusion of Intruder III in 2016 led to another new look to Toonami. On December 31, 2016, Toonami aired its first subtitled anime broadcast with the music video of Porter Robinson and Madeon's Shelter, produced in collaboration with A-1 Pictures and Crunchyroll. However, the subtitled parts in both the start and end of the music video have been removed due to an unknown error. As of right now, it is unknown that the full version of the music video could air in the future. A fifth T.I.E. titled Countdown was released from November 4 through November 25, 2017. It centers T.O.M. being sent into the future where SARA takes over the Vindication after passing through an unknown nebula while his future counterpart travels to the present to destroy the ship to prevent her from becoming evil. The event concluded with T.O.M. having scratches and minimal damage on his body. On March 20, 2018, Production I.G. and Adult Swim announced that two new seasons of FLCL, FLCL Progressive, and FLCL Alternative would premiere on Toonami in 2018, with the date set for June 2 at 11:30PM. On April Fools' Day 2018, Toonami was entirely dubbed in Japanese and kicked the prank off by airing a preview of the first episode of FLCL Alternative in Japanese with English subtitles. The Toonami logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as „Éà„Ç¶„Éä„Éü). Toonami followed the sneak preview by airing the film Mind Game and aired programming after that was originally scheduled after Black Clover, except Iron-Blooded Orphans, in original Japanese with English subtitles. TOM was voiced by Masa Kanome, a Japanese stunt actor who had been in a Wolverine movie, and Sara was voiced by Fusako Shiotani. On September 29, Toonami expanded to seven full hours from 9 PM to 4 AM with Boruto: Naruto Next Generations as the marquee addition. On December 13, it was announced that Toonami would remove Dragon Ball Z Kai and Samurai Jack from its lineup, cutting the block down to 6 hours. Also, the block would be moved back and would air from 11 PM-5 AM, starting on January 5, 2019, because of Adult Swim taking back the 8 PM hour from Cartoon Network. On January 24, it was announced that Toonami would remove Pop Team Epic and Iron-Blooded Orphans from its lineup, cutting the block down to 5 hours. On May 13, 2019, Adult Swim announced that Toonami would be shifting its whole block thirty minutes earlier, starting at 10:30 PM and ending at 3:30 AM, cutting a half-hour rerun of Family Guy. The changes began on May 25, 2019. On May 24, 2019, MomoCon announced that a new T.I.E., The Forge, would begin airing on November 9.

On July 20, it was revealed that Fire Force would be joining the block at 1:00 AM.https://www.facebook.com/1440408039583372/posts/2179755838981918?sfns=mo On July 7 at RTX 2019, it was announced that Gen:Lock would be joining the block on August 3. On August 16, it was announced that Toonami would expand 30 minutes and reshuffling its block with Dr. Stone at 12:00 AM. = 2019‚Äìpresent: T.O.M. 6 era = On January 8, 2020, it was announced that Sword Art Online: Alicization ‚Äì War of Underworld would premiere on the network on January 18. On January 23, it was announced that Toonami would be reducing the block to five hours, as Fire Force was ending its run; the new block aired from 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM. On February 6, it was announced that the block would lose another one and a half hours, as Dr. Stone was ending its run, while reruns of The Promised Neverland and Attack on Titan would also cease. This reduced the length of the block to three and a half hours, which aired from 11:30 PM to 3:00 AM. On April 8, it was announced that Toonami would be reduced to a three-hour block, as Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld was ending its run.

Online video services   Toonami Reactor  On March 26, 2001, Cartoon Network launched Toonami Reactor, their first online streaming video service. The three-month service featured streaming episodes from Dragon Ball Z and Star Blazers, the latter of which was an online- exclusive series. Editorial content was provided by the now-defunct Animerica Magazine, published by VIZ Media. After the three-month \\"trial run\\" was over, Cartoon Network took it offline and completely revamped it. On November 14, 2001, Cartoon Network relaunched Toonami Reactor with all online-exclusive programs such as Star Blazers, Patlabor: The TV Series, Harlock Saga, and Record of Lodoss War, as well as videos from Daft Punk and Toonami-themed games. In the summer of 2002, Toonami Reactor was revamped again under the Adult Swim aegis and, in a joint venture with VIZ's Weekly Shonen Jump, programmed it as \\"Adult Swim Pipeline.\\" It featured episodes and/or manga chapters from One Piece, Naruto, Shaman King, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Sand Land.  Toonami Jetstream  On April 25, 2006, Cartoon Network and VIZ Media announced plans to launch Toonami Jetstream, a new ad-supported streaming video service featuring Toonami series like Naruto, Samurai Jack, Megas XLR, and IGPX, and the Internet webcast premieres of Hikaru no Go, M√ÑR, Eyeshield 21, The Prince of Tennis, MegaMan Star Force, Kiba, MegaMan NT Warrior, and Zoids: Genesis, the latter two of which were never streamed. Toonami Jetstream launched on July 17, 2006 (after a brief unofficial sneak preview that began on July 14), and offered episodes of Naruto, Hikaru no Go, M√ÑR, Zatch Bell!, Pok√©mon, Blue Dragon, Samurai Jack, Kiba, Storm Hawks and Transformers: Animated. On January 31, 2009, Toonami Jetstream was discontinued. Since then, many of the shows aired until cancellation aired on Cartoon Network Video on its main website. In 2012, Adult Swim rebranded their action videos section as \\"Toonami shows.\\" It initially featured content from Durarara!!, which never aired on the block.  Toonami Pre-Flight  On February 27, 2015, adultswim.com launched the online show Toonami: Pre-Flight hosted by Toonami producers Jason DeMarco and Gill Austin. The first two episodes premiered on a Friday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, and was then moved to Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time until September 25, 2015, when the show was moved back to Fridays at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time. Each episode features a series highlight, a weekly topic and other featurettes like sneak peeks at promos and spots, as well as announcements, and segments from voiceover talent Steve Blum and Dana Swanson. Toonami has also done panels from MomoCon, San Diego Comic-Con, Dragon Con and Anime Expo which they've streamed as part of Pre-Flight either live or on tape delay.  Crunchyroll  The anime-oriented streaming service Crunchyroll became a sibling asset to Adult Swim after AT&T;'s acquisition of Time Warner, and its subsequent acquisition of the remaining shares in AT&T;'s existing venture Otter Media. In March 2019, Adult Swim and Otter were briefly placed under Warner Bros. as part of a corporate reorganization. The corresponding announcement stated that there would be synergies between Toonami and the service; the two properties had already announced a collaboration on Blade Runner: Black Lotus, an anime series set within the Blade Runner universe.

Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt). Ruqayyah bint Ali ibn Abu Talib was the daughter of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abu Talib with his wife Sahba' bint Rabi'a al-Taghlibiyya. Ruqayah bint Ali was the Half sister of Al-Abbas ibn Ali and also the wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel (emissary of third Shi'a Imam Husayn ibn Ali to Kufah). Others are said to be Muslim ibn Aqil's sister and daughters. It is said that these ladies came here after the event of the battle of Karbala on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in 61 AH (October 10, AD 680). Bibi Pak Daman, which means the \\"chaste lady\\", is the collective name of the six ladies believed to interred at this mausoleum, though it is also (mistakenly) popularly used to refer to the personage of Ruqayyah bint Ali alone. They were among the women who brought Islam to South Asia, preaching and engaging in missionary activity in the environs of Lahore. Some scholars consider Ruqayah to have been the daughter of Sayid Ahmed Tokhta (12th century). Bibi Paak Daaman is located between Garhi Shahu and Railway Station area. The easiest way to go to Bibi Paak Daaman is from the Empress Road and from there, take the small road opposite Police Lines and then the first left-turn. Recently Government of Pakistan is considering approval of the expansion of the Bibi Pak Daman's shrine. Life After the events at Karbala five Muslim women, led by Ruqayyah bint Ali(s.a) left Mecca to settle and proselytize in Lahore, as a result of which a sizable portion of the Hindu community entered Islam. According to one school of thought among historians such as S.M. Latif, Molvi Noor Ahmad Chishti and Mufti Ghulam Server the daughters of Ali were instructed by their father to go to Sind and Hind to preach the Islamic faith. It was prophesied that their mission would achieve success. The events of the massacre at Karbala caused many relatives of Muhammad including Ruqayyah to migrate to Makran where she preached Islam for several years. The Hindu Raja of Jaisalmer felt threatened by her missionary work. Umayyad rulers were also displeased and a number of Umayyad spies were dispatched to assassinate her. Among such potential assassins had been Muhammad Bin Qasim who later switched allegiances and became a supporter of Ruqayyah after learning of the sufferings experienced by the family of Muhammad(s.a). However, continued threats to Ruqayyah's life caused her to cross the Indus River to settle in Lahore. The local Hindu ruler there attempted to arrest her but this failed when his son, the prince Bakrama Sahi, accepted Islam and became impressed with Ruqayyah's work. This enabled Ruqayyah(s.a) to continue her missionary activities in peace for some more time. Eventually, fearing disgrace at the hands of the Hindu Raja's army when they were again dispatched to arrest her and the other five ladies, she gathered her female kin and made a collective prayer for rescue. As a fulfillment of their wishes, the ground split and their camp went underground. A shawl remained to mark the spot of that event. Another school of thought among historians, including Kanhya Lal, Muhammad Aslam and Tanveer Anjum, argue that there was no reason for these Muslim women to settle in the Hindu-ruled Lahore. Names in history Seven ladies and four men are traceable from history, as it is found that she introduced herself stating that ‚Äú I am widow of Martyr Muslim bin Aqeel, daughter of Ali and sister of commander-in-chief Abbas of Imam Hussain's Army and other five ladies were my sisters in law, whereas the sixth one was our maid ‚ÄúHalima‚Äù but she was equal to us in status. She introduced further telling the names of men that they were our guards and belonged to our tribes namely (i) Abb-ul-Fatah (ii) Abb-ul-Fazal (iii) Abb-ul-Mukaram, and (iv) Abdullah. The name of first Mujawir (one who looks after the grave and cares for visitors) was Baba Khaki. Besides two names ‚Äú Ruqaya and Halima‚Äù Dr. Masood Raza Khaki, the then Deputy Director General in the Education Department (1977), Government of Punjab, traces the five names from historical records as: :(1)Umm-e-Hani (2)Umm-e- Luqman (3) Asma (4)Ramla (5)Zainab Historically, the first proper Khanqah was constructed by Malik Ayaz in the period of 11th Century and reconstructed in the regime of Akbar the great. Historical Misconceptions There is a very famous misconception in indian subcontinent regarding Syeda Ruqayyah bint Ali which states that This Holy lady is the Daughter of Umm ul-Banin and full sister of Abbas ibn Ali. Which in reality is a misconception as Umm ul-Banin (Meaning Mother of several sons) had no daughter. Urs Sharif/Death Anniversary  The shrine is visited by both Shias and Sunnis. In the Islamic month of Jumada al-Thani three days urs of Bibi Pak Daman from 7 to 9 is celebrated. The urs proceedings are mostly a Sunni affair while Shias visit the shrine most commonly during Muharram and Safar. Many Shias also visit during the urs. The street and shrine area remain filled with devotees all the day from all over Pakistan. On the eve of Urs, the shrine is even more crowded. People from across the subcontinent, mainly from Provinces of Punjab and Sindh, come to the shrine to pay their homage and make a wish which they believe more likely would come true. A narrow lane that leads to the shrine has shops on both sides containing Muharram-related items. Imam Ali, Imam Hassan, Imam Hussain and literature on the history of Karbala, Khak-e-Shifa (soil of Karbla) and CDs of Nohas (elegies) are available at the shops. A reverence event of urs includes a ritual in which women devotees bring water for ablution of the graves at the shrine of Bibi. The Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab Limited (TDCP), Government of Punjab has placed this shrine in the list of some popular shrines for the tourists.

The novel is often cited as one of the supreme achievements in literature. The magical realist style and thematic substance of One Hundred Years of Solitude established it as an important representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s,\\"One Hundred Years at Forty\\" (December 2007) The Walrus, Canada which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement. Since it was first published in May 1967 in Buenos Aires by Editorial Sudamericana, One Hundred Years of Solitude has been translated into 46 languages and sold more than 50 million copies. The novel, considered Garc√≠a M√°rquez's magnum opus, remains widely acclaimed and is recognized as one of the most significant works both in the Hispanic literary canonhttp://www.rae.es/obras-academicas/ediciones-conmemorativas and in world literature. Biography and publication Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez was one of the four Latin American novelists first included in the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s; the other three were the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa, the Argentine Julio Cort√°zar, and the Mexican Carlos Fuentes. One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) earned Garc√≠a M√°rquez international fame as a novelist of the magical realism movement within Latin American literature.\\"The Modern World\\". Web, www.themodernword.com/gabo/. April 17, 2010 As a metaphoric, critical interpretation of Colombian history, from foundation to contemporary nation, One Hundred Years of Solitude presents different national myths through the story of the Buend√≠a family, whose spirit of adventure places them amidst the important actions of Colombian historical events, such as the Liberal political reformation of a colonial way of life, and the 19th-century arguments for and against it; the arrival of the railway to a mountainous country; the Thousand Days' War (Guerra de los Mil D√≠as, 1899‚Äì1902); the corporate hegemony of the United Fruit Company (\\"American Fruit Company\\" in the story); the cinema; the automobile; and the military massacre of striking workers as government‚Äìlabour relations policy. Plot One Hundred Years of Solitude is the story of seven generations of the Buend√≠a Family in the town of Macondo. The founding patriarch of Macondo, Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a, and √örsula Iguar√°n, his wife (and first cousin), leave Riohacha, Colombia, after Jos√© Arcadio kills Prudencio Aguilar after a cockfight for suggesting Jos√© Arcadio was impotent. One night of their emigration journey, while camping on a riverbank, Jos√© Arcadio dreams of \\"Macondo\\", a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it. Upon awakening, he decides to establish Macondo at the riverside; after days of wandering the jungle, his founding of Macondo is utopic. Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a believes Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that island, he invents the world according to his perceptions. Soon after its foundation, Macondo becomes a town frequented by unusual and extraordinary events that involve the generations of the Buend√≠a family, who are unable or unwilling to escape their periodic (mostly self-inflicted) misfortunes. For years the town is solitary and unconnected to the outside world, with the exception of the annual visit of a band of gypsies, who show the townspeople technology such as magnets, telescopes, and ice. The leader of the gypsies, a man named Melqu√≠ades, maintains a close friendship with Jos√© Arcadio, who becomes increasingly withdrawn, obsessed with investigating the mysteries of the universe presented to him by the gypsies. Ultimately he is driven insane, speaking only in Latin, and is tied to a chestnut tree by his family for many years until his death. Eventually Macondo becomes exposed to the outside world and the government of newly independent Colombia. A rigged election between the Conservative and Liberal parties is held in town, inspiring Aureliano Buend√≠a to join a civil war against the Conservative government. He becomes an iconic revolutionary leader, fighting for many years and surviving multiple attempts on his life, but ultimately tires of war and signs a peace treaty with the Conservatives. Disillusioned, he returns to Macondo and spends the rest of his life making tiny gold fish in his workshop. The railroad comes to Macondo, bringing in new technology and many foreign settlers. An American fruit company establishes a banana plantation outside the town, and builds its own segregated village across the river. This ushers in a period of prosperity that ends in tragedy as the Colombian army massacres thousands of striking plantation workers, an incident based on the Banana Massacre of 1928. Jos√© Arcadio Segundo, the only survivor of the massacre, finds no evidence of the massacre, and the surviving townspeople refuse to believe it happened. By the novel's end, Macondo has fallen into a decrepit and near-abandoned state, with the only remaining Buend√≠as being Amaranta √örsula and her nephew Aureliano, whose parentage is hidden by his grandmother Fernanda, and he and Amaranta √örsula unknowingly begin an incestuous relationship. They have a child who bears the tail of a pig, fulfilling the lifelong fear of the long-dead matriarch √örsula. Amaranta √örsula dies in childbirth and the child is devoured by ants, leaving Aureliano as the last member of the family. He decodes an encryption Melqu√≠ades had left behind in a manuscript generations ago. The secret message informs the recipient of every fortune and misfortune that the Buend√≠a family's generations lived through. As Aureliano reads the manuscript, a wind destroys all traces of Macondo's existence. The Buendia family tree. Symbolism and metaphors A dominant theme in One Hundred Years of Solitude is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history in Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. \\"The ghosts are symbols of the past and the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history\\". \\"Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buend√≠as always were ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions.\\" The fate of Macondo is both doomed and predetermined from its very existence. \\"Fatalism is a metaphor for the particular part that ideology has played in maintaining historical dependence, by locking the interpretation of Latin American history into certain patterns that deny alternative possibilities. The narrative seemingly confirms fatalism in order to illustrate the feeling of entrapment that ideology can performatively create.\\" Garc√≠a M√°rquez uses colours as symbols. Yellow and gold are the most frequently used and symbolize imperialism and the Spanish Siglo de Oro. Gold signifies a search for economic wealth, whereas yellow represents death, change, and destruction.Some Implications of Yellow and Gold in Garc√≠a M√°rquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\": Color Symbolism, Onomastics, and Anti-Idyll\\" by John Carson Pettey Citation Revista Hisp√°nica Moderna, A√±o 53, No. 1 pp. 162‚Äì178 Year 2000 The glass city is an image that comes to Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a in a dream. It is the reason for Macondo's location, but also a symbol of its fate. Higgins writes, \\"By the final page, however, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages. Macondo thus represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history.\\" Images such as the glass city and the ice factory represent how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction. There is an underlying pattern of Latin American history in One Hundred Years of Solitude. It has been said that the novel is one of a number of texts that \\"Latin American culture has created to understand itself.\\"\\"Cien a√±os de soledad: the novel as myth and archive\\" by Gonzalez Echevarria. p. 358-80 Year 1984 In this sense, the novel can be conceived as a linear archive that narrates the story of a Latin America discovered by European explorers, which had its historical entity developed by the printing press. The Archive is a symbol of the literature that is the foundation of Latin American history and also a decoding instrument. Melqu√≠ades, the keeper of the archive, represents both the whimsical and the literary. Finally, \\"the world of One Hundred Years of Solitude is a place where beliefs and metaphors become forms of fact, and where more ordinary facts become uncertain.\\" The use of particular historic events and characters renders One Hundred Years of Solitude an exemplary work of magical realism, wherein the novel compresses centuries of cause and effect whilst telling an interesting story. Characters First generation ;Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a is the patriarch of the Buend√≠a family and the founder of Macondo.Gordo-Guarinos, Francisco. Cien a√±os de soledad. Barcelona: Editorial Vosgos, S.A., 1977. Buend√≠a leaves Riohacha, Colombia, along with his wife √örsula Iguar√°n after being haunted by the corpse of Prudencio Aguilar (a man Buend√≠a killed in a duel), who constantly bleeds from his wound and tries to wash it. One night while camping at the side of a river, Buend√≠a dreams of a city of mirrors named Macondo and decides to establish the town in this location. Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a is an introspective and inquisitive man of massive strength and energy who spends more time on his scientific pursuits than with his family. He flirts with alchemy and astronomy and becomes increasingly withdrawn from his family and community. ;√örsula Iguar√°n √örsula Iguar√°n is one of the two matriarchs of the Buend√≠a family and is wife to Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a. She lives to be well over 100 years old and she oversees the Buend√≠a household through six of the seven generations documented in the novel. She exhibits a very strong character and often succeeds where the men of her family fail, for example finding a route to the outside world from Macondo. Second generation ;Jos√© Arcadio Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a's firstborn son, Jos√© Arcadio seems to have inherited his father's headstrong, impulsive mannerisms. He eventually leaves the family to chase a Gypsy girl and unexpectedly returns many years later as an enormous man covered in tattoos, claiming that he's sailed the seas of the world. He marries his adopted sister Rebeca, causing his banishment from the mansion, and he dies from a mysterious gunshot wound, days after saving his brother from execution. ;Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a's second son and the first person to be born in Macondo. He was thought to have premonitions because everything he said came true. He represents not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women, all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age. ;Remedios Moscote Remedios was the youngest daughter of the town's Conservative administrator, Don Apolinar Moscote. Her most striking physical features are her beautiful skin and her emerald-green eyes. The future Colonel Aureliano falls in love with her, despite her extreme youth. She dies shortly after the marriage from a blood poisoning illness during her pregnancy. Until soon before the Colonel's death, her dolls are displayed in his bedroom. ;Amaranta The third child of Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a, Amaranta grows up as a companion of her adopted sister Rebeca. However, her feelings toward Rebeca turn sour over Pietro Crespi, whom both sisters intensely desire in their teenage years. Amaranta dies a lonely and virginal spinster, but comfortable in her existence after having finally accepted what she had become. ;Rebeca Rebeca is the second cousin of √örsula Iguaran and the orphaned child of Nicanor Ulloa and his wife Rebeca Montiel. At first she is extremely timid, refuses to speak, and has the habits of eating earth and whitewash from the walls of the house, a condition known as pica. She arrives carrying a canvas bag containing her parents' bones and seems not to understand or speak Spanish. However, she responds to questions asked by Visitaci√≥n and Cataure in the Guajiro or Wayuu language. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother Jos√© Arcadio after his return from traveling the world. After his mysterious and untimely death, she lives in seclusion for the rest of her life. Third generation ;Arcadio Arcadio is Jos√© Arcadio's illegitimate son by Pilar Ternera. He is a schoolteacher who assumes leadership of Macondo after Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a leaves. He becomes a tyrannical dictator and uses his schoolchildren as his personal army and Macondo soon becomes subject to his whims. When the Liberal forces in Macondo fall, Arcadio is shot by a Conservative firing squad. ;Aureliano Jos√© Aureliano Jos√© is the illegitimate son of Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a and Pilar Ternera. He joins his father in several wars before deserting to return to Macondo upon hearing that it is possible to marry one's aunt. Aureliano Jos√© is obsessed with his aunt, Amaranta, who raised him since birth and who categorically rejects his advances. He is eventually shot to death by a Conservative captain midway through the wars. ;Santa Sof√≠a de la Piedad Santa Sof√≠a is a beautiful virgin girl and the daughter of a shopkeeper. She is hired by Pilar Ternera to have sex with her son Arcadio, her eventual husband. She is taken in along with her children by the Buend√≠as after Arcadio's execution. After √örsula's death she leaves unexpectedly, not knowing her destination. ;17 Aurelianos During his 32 civil war campaigns, Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a has 17 sons by 17 different women, each named after their father. Four of these Aurelianos (A. Triste, A. Serrador, A. Arcaya and A. Centeno) stay in Macondo and become a permanent part of the family. Eventually, as revenge against the Colonel, all are assassinated by the government, which identified them by the mysteriously permanent Ash Wednesday cross on their foreheads. The only survivor of the massacre is A. Amador, who escapes into the jungle only to be assassinated at the doorstep of his father's house many years later. Fourth generation Remedios the Beauty Remedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sof√≠a's first child. It is said she is the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally delayed. However, Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a believes she has inherited great lucidity: \\"It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war,\\" he said. She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon, while folding Fernanda's white sheet. ;Jos√© Arcadio Segundo Jos√© Arcadio Segundo is the twin brother of Aureliano Segundo, the children of Arcadio and Santa Sof√≠a. √örsula believes that the two were switched in their childhood, as Jos√© Arcadio begins to show the characteristics of the family's Aurelianos, growing up to be pensive and quiet. He plays a major role in the banana worker strike, and is the only survivor when the company massacres the striking workers. Afterward, he spends the rest of his days studying the parchments of Melqu√≠ades, and tutoring the young Aureliano. He dies at the exact instant that his twin does. ;Aureliano Segundo Of the two brothers, Aureliano Segundo is the more boisterous and impulsive, much like the Jos√© Arcadios of the family. He takes his first girlfriend Petra Cotes as his mistress during his marriage to the beautiful and bitter Fernanda del Carpio. When living with Petra, his livestock propagate wildly, and he indulges in unrestrained revelry. After the long rains, his fortune dries up, and the Buend√≠as are left almost penniless. He turns to a search for a buried treasure, which nearly drives him to insanity. He dies of an unknown throat illness at the same moment as his twin. During the confusion at the funeral, the bodies are switched, and each is buried in the other's grave (highlighting √örsula's earlier comment that they had been switched at birth). Fernanda del Carpio Fernanda comes from a ruined, aristocratic family that kept her isolated from the world. She was chosen as the most beautiful of 5,000 girls. Fernanda is brought to Macondo to compete with Remedios for the title of Queen of the local carnival; however, her appearance turns the carnival into a bloody confrontation. After the fiasco, she marries Aureliano Segundo, who despite this maintains a domestic relation with his concubine, Petra Cotes. Nevertheless, she soon takes the leadership of the family away from the now- frail √örsula. She manages the Buend√≠a affairs with an iron fist. She has three children by Aureliano Segundo: Jos√© Arcadio; Renata Remedios, a.k.a. Meme; and Amaranta √örsula. She remains in the house after her husband dies, taking care of the household until her death. Fernanda is never accepted by anyone in the Buend√≠a household for they regard her as an outsider, although none of the Buend√≠as rebel against her inflexible conservatism. Her mental and emotional instability is revealed through her paranoia, her correspondence with the \\"invisible doctors,‚Äù and her irrational behavior towards Meme's son Aureliano, whom she tries to isolate from the whole world. Fifth generation ;Renata Remedios (a.k.a. Meme) Renata Remedios, or Meme is the second child and first daughter of Fernanda and Aureliano Segundo. While she doesn't inherit Fernanda's beauty, she does have Aureliano Segundo's love of life and natural charisma. After her mother declares that she is to do nothing but play the clavichord, she is sent to school where she receives her performance degree as well as academic recognition. While she pursues the clavichord with ‚Äúan inflexible discipline,‚Äù to placate Fernanda, she also enjoys partying and exhibits the same tendency towards excess as her father. Meme meets and falls in love with Mauricio Babilonia, but when Fernanda discovers their affair, she arranges for Mauricio to be shot, claiming that he was a chicken thief. She then takes Meme to a convent. Meme remains mute for the rest of her life, partially because of the trauma, but also as a sign of rebellion. Several months after arriving at the convent, she gives birth to a son, Aureliano. He is sent to live with the Buend√≠as. Aureliano arrives in a basket and Fernanda is tempted to kill the child in order to avoid shame, but instead claims he is an orphan in order to cover up her daughter's promiscuity and is forced to \\"tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him\\". ;Jos√© Arcadio Jos√© Arcadio, named after his ancestors in the Buend√≠a tradition, follows the trend of previous Arcadios. He is raised by √örsula, who intends for him to become Pope. He returns from Rome without having become a priest. He spends his days pining for Amaranta, the object of his obsession. Eventually, he discovers the treasure √örsula had buried under her bed, which he wastes on lavish parties and escapades with adolescent boys. Later, he begins a tentative friendship with Aureliano Babilonia, his nephew. Jos√© Arcadio plans to set Aureliano up in a business and return to Rome, but is murdered in his bath by four of the adolescent boys who ransack his house and steal his gold. ;Amaranta √örsula Amaranta √örsula is the third child of Fernanda and Aureliano. She displays the same characteristics as her namesake who dies when she is only a child. She never knows that the child sent to the Buend√≠a home is her nephew, the illegitimate son of Meme. He becomes her best friend in childhood. She returns home from Europe with an older husband, Gast√≥n, who leaves her when she informs him of her passionate affair with Aureliano. She dies of a hemorrhage after she has given birth to the last of the Buend√≠a line. Sixth generation ;Aureliano Babilonia (Aureliano II) Aureliano Babilonia, or Aureliano II, is the illegitimate child of Meme. He is hidden from everyone by his grandmother, Fernanda. He is strikingly similar to his namesake, the Colonel, and has the same character patterns as well. He is taciturn, silent, and emotionally charged. He barely knows √örsula, who dies during his childhood. He is a friend of Jos√© Arcadio Segundo, who explains to him the true story of the banana worker massacre. While other members of the family leave and return, Aureliano stays in the Buend√≠a home. He only ventures into the empty town after the death of Fernanda. He works to decipher the parchments of Melqu√≠ades but stops to have an affair with his childhood partner and the love of his life, Amaranta √örsula, not knowing that she is his aunt. When both she and her child die, he is able to decipher the parchments. \\"...Melqu√≠ades' final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man's time and space: 'The first in line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants'.\\" It is assumed he dies in the great wind that destroys Macondo the moment he finishes reading Melqu√≠ades' parchments. Seventh generation ;Aureliano Aureliano is the child of Aureliano and his aunt, Amaranta √örsula. He is born with a pig's tail, as the eldest and long dead √örsula had always feared would happen (the parents of the child had never heard of the omen). His mother dies after giving birth to him, and, due to his grief-stricken father's negligence, he is devoured by ants. Others ;Melqu√≠ades Melqu√≠ades is one of a band of gypsies who visit Macondo every year in March, displaying amazing items from around the world. Melqu√≠ades sells Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a several new inventions including a pair of magnets and an alchemist's lab. Later, the gypsies report that Melqu√≠ades died in Singapore, but he, nonetheless, returns to live with the Buend√≠a family, stating he could not bear the solitude of death. He stays with the Buend√≠as and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendia's end. Melqu√≠ades dies a second time from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buend√≠as, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes Melchizedek in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was mysterious. ;Pilar Ternera Pilar is a local woman who sleeps with the brothers Aureliano and Jos√© Arcadio. She becomes the mother of their sons, Aureliano Jos√© and Arcadio. Pilar reads the future with cards, and every so often makes an accurate, though vague, prediction. She has close ties with the Buend√≠as throughout the whole novel, helping them with her card predictions. She dies some time after she turns 145 years old (she had eventually stopped counting), surviving until the very last days of Macondo. She plays an integral part in the plot as she is the link between the second and the third generation of the Buendia family. The author highlights her importance by following her death with a declaratory \\"it was the end.\\" ;Pietro Crespi Pietro is a very handsome and polite Italian musician who runs a music school. He installs the pianola in the Buend√≠a house. He becomes engaged to Rebeca, but Amaranta, who also loves him, manages to delay the wedding for years. When Jos√© Arcadio and Rebeca agree to be married, Pietro begins to woo Amaranta, who is so embittered that she cruelly rejects him. Despondent over the loss of both sisters, he kills himself. ;Petra Cotes Petra is a dark-skinned woman with gold-brown eyes similar to those of a panther. She is Aureliano Segundo's mistress and the love of his life. She arrives in Macondo as a teenager with her first husband. After her husband dies, she begins a relationship with Jos√© Arcadio Segundo. When she meets Aureliano Segundo, she begins a relationship with him as well, not knowing they are two different men. After Jos√© Arcadio decides to leave her, Aureliano Segundo gets her forgiveness and remains by her side. He continues to see her, even after his marriage. He eventually lives with her, which greatly embitters his wife, Fernanda del Carpio. When Aureliano and Petra make love, their animals reproduce at an amazing rate, but their livestock is wiped out during the four years of rain. Petra makes money by keeping the lottery alive and provides food baskets for Fernanda and her family after the death of Aureliano Segundo. ;Mr. Herbert and Mr. Brown Mr. Herbert is a gringo who showed up at the Buend√≠a house for lunch one day. After tasting the local bananas for the first time, he arranges for a banana company to set up a plantation in Macondo. The plantation is run by the dictatorial Jack Brown. When Jos√© Arcadio Segundo helps arrange a workers' strike on the plantation, the company traps the more than three thousand strikers and machine guns them down in the town square. The banana company and the government completely cover up the event. Jos√© Arcadio is the only one who remembers the slaughter. The company arranges for the army to kill off any resistance, then leaves Macondo for good. That event is likely based on the Banana massacre, that took place in Ci√©naga, Magdalena in 1928. ;Mauricio Babilonia Mauricio is a brutally honest, generous and handsome mechanic for the banana company. He is said to be a descendant of the gypsies who visit Macondo in the early days. He has the unusual characteristic of being constantly swarmed by yellow butterflies, which follow even his lover for a time. Mauricio begins a romantic affair with Meme until Fernanda discovers them and tries to end it. When Mauricio continues to sneak into the house to see her, Fernanda has him shot, claiming he is a chicken thief. Paralyzed and bedridden, he spends the rest of his long life in solitude. ;Gast√≥n Gast√≥n is Amaranta √örsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe and returns to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gast√≥n is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it is only a matter of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he arranges for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buend√≠a. Gast√≥n takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his velocipede. ;Colonel Gerineldo Marquez He is the friend and comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. He fruitlessly woos Amaranta. ;Gabriel Garcia M√°rquez Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez is only a minor character in the novel but he has the distinction of bearing the same name as the author. He is the great-great-grandson of Colonel Gerineldo M√°rquez. He and Aureliano Babilonia are close friends because they know the history of the town, which no one else believes. He leaves for Paris after winning a contest and decides to stay there, selling old newspapers and empty bottles. He is one of the few who is able to leave Macondo before the town is wiped out entirely. Major themes Subjectivity of reality and magic realism Critics often cite certain works by Garc√≠a M√°rquez, such as A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings and One Hundred Years of Solitude, as exemplary of magic realism, a style of writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary. The term was coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925.Franz Roh: Nach-Expressionismus. Magischer Realismus. Probleme der neuesten europ√§ischen Malerei. Klinkhardt & Biermann, Leipzig 1925. The novel presents a fictional story in a fictional setting. The extraordinary events and characters are fabricated. However, the message that Garc√≠a M√°rquez intends to deliver explains a true history. Garc√≠a M√°rquez uses his fantastic story as an expression of reality. \\"In One Hundred Years of Solitude myth and history overlap. The myth acts as a vehicle to transmit history to the reader. Garc√≠a M√°rquez's novel can furthermore be referred to as anthropology, where truth is found in language and myth. What is real and what is fiction are indistinguishable. There are three main mythical elements of the novel: classical stories alluding to foundations and origins, characters resembling mythical heroes, and supernatural elements.\\" Magic realism is inherent in the novel‚Äîachieved by the constant intertwining of the ordinary with the extraordinary. This magic realism strikes at one's traditional sense of naturalistic fiction. There is something clearly magical about the world of Macondo. It is a state of mind as much as, or more than, a geographical place. For example, one learns very little about its actual physical layout. Furthermore, once in it, the reader must be prepared to meet whatever the imagination of the author presents to him or her.Ian Johnston (March 28, 1995) \\"On Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" , Malaspina University College (now Vancouver Island University), Canada Garc√≠a M√°rquez blends the real with the magical through the use of tone and narration. By maintaining the same tone throughout the novel, Garc√≠a M√°rquez makes the extraordinary blend with the ordinary. His condensation of and lackadaisical manner in describing events causes the extraordinary to seem less remarkable than it actually is, thereby perfectly blending the real with the magical.Gullon, Ricardo. \\"Review: Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez & the Lost Art of Storytelling\\". Diacritics, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Autumn, 1971), pp. 27‚Äì32. Reinforcing this effect is the unastonished tone in which the book is written. This tone restricts the ability of the reader to question the events of the novel. However, it also causes the reader to call into question the limits of reality. Furthermore, maintaining the same narrator throughout the novel familiarizes the reader with his voice and causes him or her to become accustomed to the extraordinary events in the novel. Fluidity of time One Hundred Years of Solitude contains several ideas concerning time. Although the story can be read as a linear progression of events, both when considering individual lives and Macondo's history, Garc√≠a M√°rquez allows room for several other interpretations of time: * He reiterates the metaphor of history as a circular phenomenon through the repetition of names and characteristics belonging to the Buend√≠a family.One Hundred Years of Solitude, Encyclopedia Beta. Over six generations, all the Jos√© Arcadios possess inquisitive and rational dispositions as well as enormous physical strength. The Aurelianos, meanwhile, lean towards insularity and quietude. This repetition of traits reproduces the history of the individual characters and, ultimately, a history of the town as a succession of the same mistakes ad infinitum due to some endogenous hubris in our nature. * The novel explores the issue of timelessness or eternity even within the framework of mortal existence. A major trope with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist's laboratory in the Buend√≠a family home. The laboratory was first designed by Melqu√≠ades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course. It is a place where the male Buend√≠a characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason as in the case of Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text. This is a feeling that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission. * On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind that One Hundred Years of Solitude, while basically chronological and \\"linear\\" enough in its broad outlines, also shows abundant zigzags in time, both flashbacks of matters past and long leaps towards future events. One example of this is the youthful amour between Meme and Mauricio Babilonia, which is already in full swing before we are informed about the origins of the affair. Incest A recurring theme in One Hundred Years of Solitude is the Buend√≠a family's propensity toward incest. The patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio Buend√≠a, is the first of numerous Buend√≠as to intermarry when he marries his first cousin, √örsula. Furthermore, the fact that \\"throughout the novel the family is haunted by the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig's tail\\" can be attributed to this initial act and the recurring acts of incest among the Buend√≠as. Elitism A theme throughout One Hundred Years of Solitude is the elitism of the Buend√≠a family. Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez shows his criticism of the Latin American elite through the stories of the members a high-status family who are essentially in love with themselves, to the point of being unable to understand the mistakes of their past and learn from them.Elsey, Brenda. ‚ÄúOne Hundred Years of Solitude.‚Äù History of Latin America 1810-Present. Hofstra University. Adams Hall, Hempstead. 3 March 2020. Lecture. The Buend√≠a family‚Äôs literal loving of themselves through incest not only shows how elites consider themselves to be above the law, but also reveals how little they learn from their history. Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a and Ursula fear that since their relationship is incestuous, their child will have animalistic features; even though theirs does not, the final child of the Buend√≠a line, Aureliano of Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula, has the tail of a pig, and because they do not know their history, they do not know that this fear has materialized before, nor do they know that, had the child lived, removing the tail would have resulted in his death. This speaks to how elites in Latin America do not pass down history that remembers them in a negative manner. The Buend√≠a family further cannot move beyond giving tribute to themselves in the form of naming their children the same names over and over again. ‚ÄúJos√© Arcadio‚Äù appears four times in the family tree, ‚ÄúAureliano‚Äù appears 22 times, ‚ÄúRemedios‚Äù appears three times and ‚ÄúAmaranta‚Äù and ‚ÄúUrsula‚Äù appear twice. The continual references to the sprawling Buend√≠a house call to mind the idea of a Big House, or hacienda, a large land holding in which elite families lived and managed their lands and laborers. In Colombia, where the novel takes place, a Big House was known for being a grand one-story dwelling with many bedrooms, parlors, a kitchen, a pantry and a veranda, all areas of the Buend√≠a household mentioned throughout the book. The book focuses squarely on one family in the midst of the many residents of Macondo as a representation of how the poorest of Latin American villages have been subjugated and forgotten throughout the course of Latin American history. Solitude Perhaps the most dominant theme in the book is that of solitude. Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest. The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected. Isolated from the rest of the world, the Buend√≠as grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish. With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buend√≠as become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel. This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to what some see as autism. Throughout the novel it seems as if no character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity. The selfishness of the Buend√≠a family is eventually broken by the once superficial Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes, who discover a sense of mutual solidarity and the joy of helping others in need during Macondo's economic crisis. The pair even find love, and their pattern is repeated by Aureliano Babilonia and Amaranta √örsula. Eventually, Aureliano and Amaranta √örsula have a child, and the latter is convinced that it will represent a fresh start for the once-conceited Buend√≠a family. However, the child turns out to be the perpetually feared monster with the pig's tail. Nonetheless, the appearance of love represents a shift in Macondo, albeit one that leads to its destruction. \\"The emergence of love in the novel to displace the traditional egoism of the Buend√≠as reflects the emergence of socialist values as a political force in Latin America, a force that will sweep away the Buend√≠as and the order they represent.\\" The ending to One Hundred Years of Solitude could be a wishful prediction by Garc√≠a M√°rquez, a well-known socialist, regarding the future of Latin America. Interpretation Throughout the novel, Garc√≠a M√°rquez is said to have a gift for blending the everyday with the miraculous, the historical with the fabulous, and psychological realism with surreal flights of fancy. It is a revolutionary novel that provides a looking glass into the thoughts and beliefs of its author, who chose to give a literary voice to Latin America: \\"A Latin America which neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration.\\"The Dialectics of our America: Genealogy, Cultural Critique, and Literary History Post-Contemporary Interventions, by Jos√© David Sald√≠var, Duke University Press, 1991, , pg. 21 Although we are faced with a very convoluted narrative, Garc√≠a M√°rquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third- person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness. Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the montage and the close-up, which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. This is all presented through Garc√≠a M√°rquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point. The characters in the novel are never defined; they are not created from a mold. Instead, they are developed and formed throughout the novel. All characters are individualized, with many characteristics that differentiate them from others. Ultimately, the novel has a rich imagination achieved by its rhythmic tone, narrative technique, and fascinating character creation, making it a thematic quarry, where the trivial and anecdotal and the historic and political are combined. Literary significance and acclaim One Hundred Years of Solitude has received universal recognition. The novel has been awarded Italy's Chianciano Award, France's Prix de Meilleur Livre Etranger, Venezuela's R√≥mulo Gallegos Prize, and the United States' Books Abroad/Neustadt International Prize for Literature. Garc√≠a M√°rquez also received an honorary LL.D. from Columbia University in New York City. These awards set the stage for Garc√≠a M√°rquez's 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. The novel topped the list of books that have most shaped world literature over the last 25 years, according to a survey of international writers commissioned by the global literary journal Wasafiri as a part of its 25th-anniversary celebration. The superlatives from reviewers and readers alike display the resounding praise which the novel has received. Chilean poet and Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda called it \\"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since Don Quixote of Cervantes\\", while John Leonard in The New York Times wrote that \\"with a single bound, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez leaps onto the stage with G√ºnter Grass and Vladimir Nabokov.\\" According to Antonio Sacoto, professor at the City College of the City University of New York, One Hundred Years of Solitude is considered as one of the five key novels in Hispanic American literature (together with El Se√±or Presidente, Pedro P√°ramo, La Muerte de Artemio Cruz, and La ciudad y los perros). These novels, representative of the boom allowed Hispanic American literature to reach the quality of North American and European literature in terms of technical quality, rich themes, and linguistic innovations, among other attributes.Antonio Sacoto (1979) Cinco novelas claves de la novela hispano americana (El se√±or presidente, Pedro P√°ramo, La muerte de Artemio Cruz, La ciudad y los perros, Cien a√±os de soledad), Eliseo Torres & Sons, New York In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Garc√≠a M√°rquez addressed the significance of his writing and proposed its role to be more than just literary expression: Harold Bloom remarked, \\"My primary impression, in the act of rereading One Hundred Years of Solitude, is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at the moment you read it.\\"Bloom, Harold. Bloom's Critical Interpretations: Edited and with an Introduction by Harold Bloom: \\"Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude\\". Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2003 David Haberly has argued that Garc√≠a M√°rquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, Virginia Woolf's Orlando: A Biography, Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year, and Chateaubriand's Atala, in an example of intertextuality.Haberly, David T. (1990) Bags of Bones: A Source for Cien A√±os de Soledad, The Johns Hopkins University Press Internal references In the novel's account of the civil war and subsequent peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's earlier works, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba. In the novel's final chapter, Garc√≠a M√°rquez refers to the novel Hopscotch (Spanish: Rayuela) by Julio Cort√°zar in the following line: \\"...in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die\\" (p. 412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in Hopscotch who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: The Death of Artemio Cruz (Spanish: La Muerte de Artemio Cruz) by Carlos Fuentes and Explosion in a Cathedral (Spanish: El siglo de las luces) by Alejo Carpentier. Adaptations While One Hundred Years of Solitude has had a large effect on the literary world and is the author's best-selling and most translated work, there have been no movies produced of it as Garc√≠a M√°rquez never agreed to sell the rights to produce such a film. On March 6, 2019, Garc√≠a M√°rquez's son Rodrigo Garc√≠a Barcha, announced that Netflix was developing a series based upon the book with a set release in 2020.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/07/netflix-to-adapt-one- hundred-years-of-solitude-by-gabriel-garcia- marquezhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/08/colombians-await-one- hundred-years-of-solitude-screen-adaptation-with-joy-and-fear Shuji Terayama's play One Hundred Years of Solitude (ÁôæÂπ¥„ÅÆÂ≠§Áã¨, originally performed by the Tenjo Sajiki theater troupe) and his film Farewell to the Ark („Åï„Çâ„Å∞ÁÆ±Ëàü) are loose (and not officially authorized) adaptations of the novel by Garc√≠a M√°rquez transplanted into the realm of Japanese culture and history.

It is found in coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic, from the Barents Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Within some of its range, including the Irish Sea, this species comprises a significant commercial fishery.C.Michael Hogan. (2011). Irish Sea. eds. P. Saundry & C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC Retrieved 11 April 2017. Description It has a very large head which is broad, flat, and depressed; the rest of the body appears to be a mere appendage. The wide mouth extends all the way around the anterior circumference of the head, and both jaws are armed with bands of long, pointed teeth. These are inclined inwards, and can be closed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent its escape from the mouth. The pectoral and pelvic fins are so articulated as to perform the functions of feet, so the fish is able to walk along the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in the sand or amongst seaweed. Around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed, a structure which, combined with the extraordinary faculty of assimilating the colour of the body to its surroundings, assists this fish greatly in camouflaging itself in the places which it selects on account of the abundance of prey. It has no scales. Angling Skeleton - MHNT Lophius piscatorius The fish has long filaments along the middle of its head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin. The filament most important to the angler is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a lappet, and is movable in every direction. The angler is believed to attract other fish by means of its lure, and then to seize them with its enormous jaws. While it is considered probable that smaller fish are attracted in this way experiments have shown that the actions of the jaw is automatic and depends on contact of the prey with the tentacle. Its stomach is expandable and it is not unknown for these fish to swallow prey of their own size. Lifecycle The spawn of the angler consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material wide and long drifting freely in the water. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own little cavity. The larvae are free-swimming and their pelvic fins are elongated into filaments. A male angler matures at the age of 4 years and grows to be 16 inches long; whereas the female angler takes 2 years longer to mature.

The term indicates that the minister serves at His/Her Majesty's pleasure, and advises the sovereign or viceroy on how to exercise the Crown prerogatives relative to the minister's department or ministry. Ministries In Commonwealth realms, the sovereign or viceroy is formally advised by a larger body known as a privy council or executive council, though, in practice, they are advised by a subset of such councils: the collective body of ministers of the Crown called the ministry. The ministry should not be confused with the cabinet, as ministers of the Crown may be outside a cabinet. History Ministers of the Crown in Commonwealth realms have their roots in early modern England, where monarchs sometimes employed \\"cabinet councils\\" consisting of Ministers to advise the monarch and implemented his decisions. The term Minister came into being as the sovereign's advisors \\"ministered to\\", or served, the king. Over time, former ministers and other distinguished persons were retained as peripheral advisers with designated ministers having the direct ear of the king. This led to the creation of the larger Privy Council, with the Cabinet becoming a committee within that body, made up of currently serving Ministers, who also were heads of departments. During a period between the accession of King James VI of Scotland to the throne of England in 1603 and the unification of Scotland and England in 1707, the two entities separate \\"countries\\" in personal union through the one monarch who was advised by two separate sets of Ministers of the Crown for each country. As the English overseas possessions and later British Empire expanded, the colonial governments remained subordinate to the imperial government at Westminster, and thus the Crown was still ministered to only by the Imperial Privy Council, made up of British Ministers of the Crown. When Canada became a Dominion in 1867, however, a separate Canadian Privy Council was established to advise the Canadian Governor General on the exercise of the Crown prerogative in Canada, although constitutionally the viceroy remained an agent of the British government at Whitehall. After that date, other colonies of the empire attained Dominion status and similar arrangements were made. Following the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, however, the dominions became effectively autonomous kingdoms under one sovereign, thus returning the monarch to a position similar to that which existed pre-1707, where he or she was ministered to by separate ministries and cabinets for each respective realm or colony. Thus, today, no Minister of the Crown in any Commonwealth realm can advise the monarch to exercise any powers pertaining to any of the other dominions. Uses in other countries In Spain, during the \\"Restauraci√≥n\\" period (1874-1931) the term Minister of the Crown (Spanish: Ministro de la Corona) was used for the people who was in charge of a ministerial department of His Majesty's Government. For example, in times of King Alfonso XIII when Carlos Mar√≠a Cortezo y Prieto de Orche was appointed as \\"Ministro de Instrucci√≥n P√∫blica y Bellas Artes\\" (minister of education), in the royal decree it was noted that he was a minister of the Crown.

In Germany, it is convened solely for the purpose of electing the President of Germany, either every five years (no later than 30 days before the expiration of a sitting Presidents term) or within 30 days of the premature termination of a presidential term. The Federal Convention mirrors the aggregated majority situation of the first parliamentary chamber - Bundestag in Germany, Nationalrat in Austria and Switzerland - and the second parliamentary chamber representing the federal states (Germany, Austria) and cantons (Switzerland) respectively. In Germany, the Constitution Grundgesetz mandates that a maximum of three votes can be held. On the first two rounds, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of delegates to be elected. After that, in the third round, a plurality of all delegates voting is sufficient for election to the office of Federal President. Any delegate may nominate candidates; usually, parliamentary group puts forth candidates, and there may sometimes be consensus candidates who are supported by several of the major parties. Convening the Bundesversammlung in Germany  The Bundesversammlung is constitutionally mandated to meet not later than 30 days before the expiration of the term of the incumbent president, or not later than 30 days after a premature exit (as a result of resignation, death or removal) from the office of the Federal President. The Basic Law charges the President of the Bundestag the responsibility and authority to call and preside over a meeting of the Bundesversammlung. Procedure in Germany  Each member of the Bundesversammlung may suggest candidates for the office of the Federal President. In practice, however, only the candidates designated in advance by the parliamentary groups are suggested. The procedure of the election of the Bundespr√§sident consists of a maximum of three secret votes by written ballot. If one of the first two votes ends with an absolute majority for one of the candidates, this candidate is elected immediately. If the first two votes do not lead to an absolute majority, a plurality is sufficient on the third and final vote. According to the Grundgesetz, the President is elected without a debate at the Federal Convention. The candidates are usually nominated by one or more parties but do not generally run a campaign. The candidate whose party or parties have the majority in the Bundestag is considered to be the likely winner and, in the main, has achieved the necessary majority ‚Äì however, the Assembly can be turned around by state delegates (if the Bundestag opposition has done well in state elections), this can indicate the result of an upcoming general election (\\"If you can create a president, you can form a government\\"). The President of the Bundestag closes the session of the Bundesversammlung once the elected candidate accepts. A newly elected President does not take the oath of office before the Federal Convention: This happens in a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. The Bundesversammlung is chaired by the President of the Bundestag (or one of the Vice Presidents, if the President stands as a candidate ‚Äì as was the case with Karl Carstens in 1979). The Bundesversammlung is dissolved once the elected President declares that they accept their election, which decision may be delayed for up to two days (however, no would-be president-elect has ever done so). Membership in Germany  The Bundesversammlung includes the entire membership of the Bundestag, and an equal number of state delegates elected by the state or 'L√§nder' parliaments specifically for this purpose, proportional to their population.Election of the Federal President, Deutscher Bundestag, retrieved 2014-07-14 The L√§nder representatives are not solely politicians. It is common that the parties nominate several notable people from television, sports, and the music industry. Still, most of the L√§nder representatives are politicians. Especially those in the state cabinet are often nominated. From the time of their nomination until the closing of the session of the Federal Convention its members enjoy parliamentary immunity with regard to prosecution by public authorities in very much the same way as members of the Bundestag do. History of the German Bundesversammlung  Since 1979, the Bundesversammlung has traditionally met on May 23, the anniversary of the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany and the anniversary of the Basic Law coming into force on this day in 1949. This has changed since the resignations of former presidents Horst Koehler and Christian Wulff. The most recent assembly of the Bundesversammlung was held on 12 February 2017, after Frank-Walter Steinmeier was chosen as the single candidate of the ruling coalition in November. Venue of the German Bundesversammlung  On 12 September 1949, the first Bundesversammlung met in Bonn, which served as the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification with East Germany. From 1954 to 1969 the Bundesversammlung was convened at the Ostpreu√üenhalle in Berlin, leading to protests from the German Democratic Republic on each occasion it met. As a consequence, on March 5, 1969, the Soviet Union sent MiG-21 warplanes to fly over the venue in West Berlin. From 1974 to 1989, the Bundesversammlung met in the Beethovenhalle in Bonn. Since 1994, the meeting place has been the Reichstag building in Berlin. After the renovation of the Reichstag building, the German Bundestag moved to the building in April 1999. Since the meeting of the Bundesversammlung held in May 1999, the body has convened in the plenary chamber of the Bundestag at the Reichstag building.

The limited series was written by Neil Gaiman, penciled by Andy Kubert, and digitally painted by Richard Isanove; Scott McKowen illustrated the distinctive scratchboard covers. The eight-part series takes place in a timeline where Marvel superheroes exist in the Elizabethan era; faced with the destruction of their world by a mysterious force, the heroes must fight to save their universe. Many of the early Marvel superheroes ‚Äî Nick Fury, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man ‚Äî as well as villains such as Doctor Doom and Magneto appear in various roles. Neil Gaiman had always been a fan of Marvel, and editor Joe Quesada approached Gaiman to work on a project which eventually evolved into 1602. The success of the comic led to three sequels, entitled 1602: New World, Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four, and Spider-Man: 1602. There is also a short story, \\"Son of the Dragon\\", starring the 1602 version of The Hulk in the second issue of Hulk: Broken Worlds. In 1602: Witchhunter Angela of Marvel's 2015 Secret Wars event, Angela appears as a hunter of witchbreed (mutants). The pocket reality seen at the end of the limited series in which the continuing Marvel 1602 universe takes place is classified as Earth-311. Background Neil Gaiman stated in an afterword to the series that he had always viewed the Marvel universe as \\"magic\\". The editors of 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, approached Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief with the intent for Gaiman to work on a project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain.Gaiman, Neil (30 June 2004). \\"Afterword\\", from Marvel 1602: page 1. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided that he did not want planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. \\"I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right ‚Äì or in which might made anything.\\" On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the \\"past seemed very close at hand\\"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell.Gaiman, Neil (30 June 2004). \\"Afterword\\", from Marvel 1602: p.2. The time was chosen because \\"it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic.\\" Gaiman described writing the series as odd, since he had not written comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments. He also wanted to write a comic that was different from The Sandman, his most recognized work. The profits of the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which is fighting for the rights to Marvelman. Illustration Kubert's pencils (top) contrasted with the finished panel Unlike usual penciled pages, Marvel 1602 used a technique called \\"enhanced pencils\\", whereby the finished pencil drawings are sent straight to the colorist instead of to an inker first.Lowe, Nick. \\"Pencils\\", from Marvel 1602. This technique had been used before on Kubert's Origin, and results in cleaner and more elaborate lines. Editor Nick Lowe noticed theater posters done by Scott McKowen and decided that the \\"engraving 'look' of the scratchboard would be interesting for the historical setting of this story.\\"McKowen, Scott. \\"Cover Process\\", from Marvel 1602: page 1. Scratchboard is a technique where a sharp knife is used to scrape through a layer of black ink to a hard chalk surface underneath; in effect, artists draw white lines on an all-black surface. All McKowen's illustrations were done by hand and then colored later in Photoshop. For inspiration, McKowen looked at seventeenth- century engravings. He also added scrolls or flags to the covers for the Marvel 1602 titles, basing the designs on Renaissance paintings where scrolls are used to comment on the scenes depicted.McKowen, Scott. \\"Cover Process\\", from Marvel 1602: page 2. The hardbound edition features a scratchboard illustration depicting the main characters whispering discreetly to each other on the cover. According to McKowen, the image was inspired by a depiction of the masterminds behind the \\"Gunpowder Plot\\", an attempt to blow up Parliament during the reign of King James. Since the characters of the story are all traitors in the eyes of King James, they were drawn in a similar fashion.  Premise  In the year 1602 in the Marvel Universe, for an unknown reason, superheroes have appeared about 400 years early. They were born and bred in this era and some hold important positions in high places. When the characters come to realize that something is wrong with the universe, the heroes must solve the mystery behind their own existence, while dealing with intrigue at the courts of Elizabeth and James.  Plot  All over Europe, strange weather is provoking panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are the beginning of the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange (Doctor Strange of Marvel 1602), the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury (Nick Fury of Marvel 1602), to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch (Daredevil of Marvel 1602) to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh (Spider-Man of Marvel 1602) are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London. Meanwhile, the ship Virginia Maid arrives in England from the New World, carrying the young Virginia Dare, the first child born in Roanoke colony, as well as her hulking, fair-skinned, blond Native American bodyguard Rojhaz. They are taken to meet the Queen only for a vulture-like assassin to snatch Virginia. Rohjaz quickly disables the attacker, but Virginia has transformed into a white gryphon. Rojhaz subdues Virginia, and Stephen Strange bespells her to human form before Fury sees her transformed. She has strange shapeshifting powers, and Strange suspects she is the cause of the disastrous weather. Fury interrogates one of the assassins to learn who sent him. He is told that it is Otto von Doom (the Doctor Doom of Marvel 1602), ruler of Latveria, but Fury is too late to stop one of Doom's machines from killing Elizabeth with a poison gas released by dropping a pill into aqua regia. With Elizabeth's death, James VI becomes ruler of both England and Scotland. James is distrustful of \\"witchbreed\\" (people born with magical powers and the mutants of Marvel 1602) and collaborates with Spanish High Inquisitor Enrique (Magneto of Marvel 1602) to blame the witchbreed of England, headed by Carlos Javier (Charles Xavier of Marvel 1602), for Elizabeth's death. Fury, a friend of Carlos and his students, is forced to take the witchbreed to the Tower. Strange, Javier, and Fury meet there and discuss how to save the world ‚Äî an act which will almost surely lead to them being branded traitors by James. Strange has learned that the treasure of the Templars and its keeper Donal (Thor of Marvel 1602), and Murdoch, have been betrayed and are now in the hands of Doom. Strange also learns that Doom has been holding captive four heroes from the ship Fantastick (the Fantastic Four and their rocket ship of Marvel 1602), including Fury's friend Sir Richard Reed (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic of Marvel 1602). Knowing that James will never give him an army to march on Latveria, he conspires with the witchbreed, taking a ship levitated by Javier and his page John Grey (Jean Grey/Phoenix of Marvel 1602) across the continent. Strange meanwhile finds himself on the moon where he meets the Watcher Uatu, who tells him that the strange events are due to an anomaly he calls the Forerunner. The Forerunner is from the future and its presence in the past has disrupted reality to the point of impending annihilation of not only Strange's world but all other universes as well. Explaining his theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen's Earth is the result of the universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat what he has learned while he is alive. Fury, Javier and his witchbreed launch a successful attack on Count Doom's fortress. The Four of the Fantastick are freed, and Doom is horribly scarred by what he believes is the Templar's treasure; in fact, Donal's walking stick is the true treasure, and using it Donal becomes the Norse god Thor. Having nowhere else to go, the ship of fugitives heads for the New World. In Spain, Enrique, the Inquisitor who has killed so many witchbreed, is exposed as a witchbreed himself and sentenced to be burned at the stake with his young acolytes, Petros and Sister Wanda (Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch of Earth 1602). Enrique breaks their bonds and they escape on a ship of their own, also bound for America. Sir Stephen Strange is executed by James, and his head put on a pike. With his magic, his spirit can still communicate in a telepathic way, allowing him to explain the warning that he received from Uatu now that he is dead and no longer bound by Uatu's original compulsion. His wife Clea takes his head from the pike and sets off for America with Virginia and Rojhaz. Clea believes that Strange's suspicions were wrong: Virginia is not the Forerunner, it is her blond-haired, blue-eyed \\"Native American\\" companion. Rojhaz is in fact Steve Rogers, the future costumed superhero known as Captain America. After fighting against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life (revealed to be the Purple Man), Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely that not even his ashes would remain to inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only brought about a rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes of the twentieth century to appear centuries earlier to counter the Forerunner's negative effects. Fury and company arrive at the Roanoke colony, where they discover the rift that is tearing their universe apart. Javier, realizing that his enemy Enrique may be the key to manipulating the rift and thus saving the universe, traps him and his followers in their ship. However, it is the former Inquisitor who dictates terms. James sends his adviser Banner (Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk of Marvel 1602) and Peter Parquagh to America with orders to kill Fury. When they arrive in America, Fury single-handedly kills all the members of their ship aside from Banner and Peter. In spite of this, Fury has almost lost the will to live: he failed to protect his Queen, he has been made a traitor to his country, and all his wealth and property has been seized and taken over by James and his favorites. Donal meanwhile turns to alcohol, devastated at the fact that he has brought about a god who, according to Donal's religion, should not even exist. However, Reed's analysis leads him to believe that the final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to turn into the Viking god once more. Back in England, having just been crowned King, James feels that everything is going his way, but then Murdoch breaks into his chamber and warns him in no uncertain terms of the consequences should anything happen to Fury, or Murdoch's native Ireland. Rojhaz, looking more like the Captain America of old (or of the future, as the case may be), refuses to go back through the rift: he hopes to build a better America from the beginning. Fury tricks Rojhaz by playing on the trust that Captain America had for the Nick Fury of his own time, knocks him unconscious and carries the body back through the rift, thus going into the future himself. The rift and the universe restore themselves, meaning the destruction of the alternate timeline; however, Uatu the Watcher is granted a \\"pocket universe\\" by his colleagues in which the 1602 timeline remains intact, and where the powered fugitives decide to settle in the Roanoke colony, declaring it a free place for all. Meanwhile, while walking in the woods with Virginia, Peter is bitten by a spider and Banner, who shielded Peter from the energies released when Rojhaz and Fury entered the rift, has changed into a hulking gray monster. Intrigued by the continuing events, Uatu continues to watch the new universe (later designated Earth-311). Characters 1602 features both historical figures and many of the original Marvel superheroes and villains. Some popular characters, such as Wolverine, were not added, because of Gaiman's vision to address the heroes of the 1960s. \\"The territory doesn't go much further than 1969 in terms of the characters that I picked to use,\\" Gaiman noted. \\"I couldn't get everybody in because there are an awful lot of Marvel characters.\\" * Elizabeth I of England: The aging Queen of England. Already close to death, she is killed by a poisonous gas device constructed by Otto Von Doom (the Doctor Doom of this reality). * James I of England: Originally King James VI of Scotland, James becomes the monarch over England as well with Elizabeth's death. James maintains an intense hatred of witchbreed (the mutants of this reality) and seeks to destroy them along with any who practice sorcery or witchcraft. * Virginia Dare: The daughter of Ananias Dare, and the first English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers went into this world he saved the colony, which would have been killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Rogers' arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this. * Uatu, the Watcher: A younger member of a race of intelligent beings who have sworn not to interfere in the affairs of lesser races, only to watch and observe. He breaks this oath, however, by explaining the situation to an astral projection of Doctor Stephen Strange. * Sir Nicholas Fury: The Queen's intelligence officer (referred to as the \\"intelligencer\\") and responsible for foiling many past plots against the monarch. Seemingly killed when he carries an unconscious Rojhaz into the dimensional rift. * Doctor Stephen Strange: The Queen's Physician, who is also a magician and alchemist. He allows himself to be beheaded by King James, which subsequently frees him from the restriction placed upon him by Uatu, the Watcher (namely, that he could not reveal what he knows while still living). * Peter Parquagh: Sir Nicholas' apprentice; left orphaned and tended to by his aunt and uncle until Fury arrived and took the boy to London. * Matthew Murdoch: A blind Irish minstrel who moonlights as a freelance agent. Matthew acquired heightened senses from a mysterious substance he encountered as a child. * Clea Strange: Stephen Strange's wife and assistant, Clea actually comes from another dimension. After bringing her husband's severed head to the Roanoke colony ‚Äì thus fulfilling her last promise to him ‚Äì she asks the heroes to bury the head with the rest of the body and then returns to her home dimension. * Rojhaz: Virginia's blonde- haired, blue-eyed Native American bodyguard, who in fact is a displaced Captain America from a dystopian future. When the government of his time ruled by Purple Man captured him and attempted to execute him using advanced technology, he was accidentally sent back in time ‚Äì the event which triggered the alternate timeline to begin with ‚Äì thus forming the paradox of the story. * Carlos Javier: A Spaniard living in England, where he runs a \\"College for the Sons of Gentlefolk\\", in fact a haven for \\"witchbreed\\". His students include Roberto Trefusis, Scotius Summerisle, Hal McCoy, Werner, and \\"John\\" Grey (who is in fact a young woman with psychic powers rivaling that of his own). * The Four from the Fantastick: A band of explorers who gained powers when their ship encountered a strange energy vortex at sea. The four are Captain Benjamin Grimm, Sir Richard Reed, Susan Storm, and John Storm. Their bodies were reshaped into the four elements: Reed's body became pliable like water, Grimm's body became solid rock, Susan's body became weightless and invisible like air, and John's body became living fire. They are eventually captured by Doom. * Grand Inquisitor Enrique: Born a Sephardic Jew, a young Enrique was forcibly baptized and seduced by a Catholic priest, and thus inducted into the church. As an adult, he leads the Spanish Inquisition ‚Äì a position of power through which he can further his own plans. Although ordered to execute the witchbreed, he hides those whom he can pass off as normal. Secretly a witchbreed himself, he uses his activities as a cover to form a \\"Brotherhood of Those Who Will Inherit the Earth\\". He is assisted by Sister Wanda and Petros, who are secretly his children. He is also aided by Toad, despite Toad's betrayal at one point. * David Banner: An advisor to King James, Banner is sent to Roanoke in order to kill Fury. When the rift is closed at the end of the story, Banner is caught within the backlash and is later seen lurking in the nearby woods as a massive gray-skinned creature (the Hulk). * Count Otto von Doom: Doom is the ruler of Latveria, known as Otto the Handsome due to his perfect physique and appearance. He captures the Fantastick Four in order to force Reed's compliance in creating war machines, poisons, and various other inventions. Von Doom is later struck and badly burned by Thor's lightning, although he survives. * Donal the Guardian of the Templar Treasure and alter ego to Thor, who is captured by Count Otto von Doom on his way to deliver the treasure of the Templars (the hammer Mjolnir disguised as a simple walking stick) to England. He is rescued by Sir Nicholas Fury and the witchbreed and is taken to the New World along with the Fantastick Four. * Natasha: She travels with Matthew while en route to meet Donal, who is bringing the Templar Treasure to England. Natasha is revealed to be working for Count Otto von Doom. Reception and legacy The first issue of 1602 was ranked first in August 2003 US comics with pre-order sales of 150,569. 1602 received mixed praised upon its release with Comics Bulletin stating \\"Is 1602 good? Yes, it's damn good. Is it revolutionary or even ground breaking? No. Sorry, but I can't go so far as to call a glorified What If? series anything more than what it is; a well done re-imagination of the Marvel Universe.\\" Entertainment Weekly declared that the combination of writing and moody artwork meant \\"the Marvel Universe hasn't been this engrossing in ages.\\" ShakingThrough.net noted that fans looking for elements of Gaiman's The Sandman would be disappointed; \\"It's not a senses-shattering Marvel epic, but then it's not meant to be. It's nothing more or less than a chance to enjoy reinterpretations of some familiar characters.\\" UGO Networks concurred, stating \\"there doesn't need to be a 'point' in re-imagining familiar icons ‚Äî it's simply meant to be fun. [...] The result of 1602 is agreeable entertainment.\\" The series won several awards, including the Quill Book Award for Graphic Novels. The first issue was also awarded the 2003 Diamond Distributors Gem Award as \\"Comic of the Year\\". Conversely, Time Magazine listed it as the worst comic of 2003, although the list's composer later stated \\"he didn't actually mean it was the worst comic of the year.\\" UGO's Darren Latta noted as a downside to the series that \\"the approach maybe a little too subdued at times.\\" Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential. Others simply felt that Gaiman's involvement led to inflated expectations; one review noted that while reading \\"I [...] felt at times like maybe it was all a little bit too cute, a little bit too in-jokey.\\" Sequels 1602s success led to three sequels. * The first, 1602: New World, takes place shortly after the end of 1602, with the heroes settling down in America. The series was written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Greg Tocchini, and the first issue was published in August 2005. During that time, Lord Iron and Captain Ross had arrived to hunt down David Banner while coming into conflict with the Spider and Virginia Dare. Meanwhile, Master Osborn tries to turn the natives against the settlers. * The second sequel, Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four, was written by Peter David and pencilled by Pascal Alixe. The story involves the Fantastic Four's adventures in London, the return of Otto Von Doom, and the \\"Four Who Are Frightful\\" when they capture William Shakespeare to chronicle Otto von Doom's travels to Bensaylum (this reality's Alantis). * The third sequel Spider-Man: 1602, was written by Jeff Parker and pencilled by Ramon Rosanas. The story centers on the continuing adventures of the Spider and features reinterpretations of Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, and Mary Jane Watson. Also appearing are the Beast, Janet and Henry Pym, the Kingpin (reimaged as a pirate named King's Pin), Bullseye (reimaged as an assassin and first mate of the King's Pin), and Steve Rogers. Spider-Verse The Marvel 1602 universe appears in a lead-up to Spider-Verse. Peter Parquah is on stage at the Globe Theatre with Marion Jane Watson's family when Morlun appears. Peter attempts to defend himself, but Morlun proves too powerful. Morlun brings down the Globe Theater around everyone, and absorbs Peter's life essence. Before disappearing into another dimension, Morlun declares that all spiders will die.Free Comic Book Day Vol 2014 Guardians Secret Wars (2015) Marvel 1602 appears in Secret Wars where its domain on Battleworld is referred to as King James' England. It is mostly featured in the comic 1602: Witch Hunter Angela (which features a witch hunter version of Angela). The Secret Wars Marvel 1602 now includes Bronze Age and Modern Age Marvel characters. In the domain of King James' England, King James (a variation of Wolverine) was its ruler until he was discovered to be a Witchbreed (this domain's version of mutants) who killed various redhaired girls. King James was seemingly killed by Sister Angela of the Holy Order who drowned him. He was succeeded is King Charles the First (who is secretly a Witchbreed leader and a variation of Professor X). With the population of Witchbreed diminished, the Witch Hunters Sister Angela of the Holy Order and her partner Lady Serah Anchorton went on to hunt Faustians, people who made deals with Demons, but, before doing so, they went to the Mermaid Tavern to drink with some friends of theirs. There they attacked Captain James Barnes of Clan Buchanan whom they believed was a Witchbreed, but it revealed itself to be a Faustian after being cut in half by Angela and reanimating its two halves as hideous monsters. Lady Serah killed the upper half. As Angela killed the bottom half, it summoned its \\"maker\\" the Enchantress. Angela tried to hit her, but she couldn't do her harm. The Enchantress threatened that Serah would die when three of her Faustians had been killed by Angela before vanishing in the air, leaving a worried Angela behind.1602: Witch Hunter Angela #1 After telling Serah about Enchantress' menace, Angela and her fellow Witch Hunter departed from London and found a troupe of players called the \\"Gardiner's Men\\" (who are this domain's version of the Guardians of the Galaxy) being attacked by beasts in the woods. They aided the troupe members Madam Gomorrah, Peadar O'Cuill, Arthur Dubhghlas, Goodman Root, and Aroughcun to kill the beasts. As the creatures had traces of Enchantress' magic on them indicating she was somewhere nearby, Angela and Serah traveled with the Gardiner's Men to a pagan village in the outskirts of York where a marriage for the town beauty Anne Weying and the young printer's apprentice Edwin Brocc was going to happen. As the festival proceeded, Angela realized young Edwin had enchanted his bride to marry him when she saw him giving her a potion to drink. Edwin noticed Angela had seen and panicked becoming a venomous monster and attacking her. Angela and her companions engaged him in battle and subdued him, afterwards Angela decapitated him. While leaving the town, Serah told Angela she wasn't afraid of her fate as long as Angela was with her.1602: Witch Hunter Angela #2 Angela and Serah then headed to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland as it was the whereabouts of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria (this domain's Rogue), the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela to keep an eye on her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.1602: Witch Hunter Angela #3 Web- Warriors The Web Warriors (Alternate versions of Spider-Man) visited the 1602 Universe to deal with the dimension's version of Sinister Six called the Sinister Sextet which consists of Carnage, Electro, Karnov, Magus, and Serpent. After apprehending the villains, they noticed the dimension's Electro has escaped. Unbeknownst to the heroes, Electro followed them back to the Great Web.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #1 Academic response James Fleming has written about the use of the postmodern tradition in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text ‚Äì a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.Fleming, James. \\"Incommensurable Ontologies and the Return of the Witness in Neil Gaiman's 1602.\\" ImageTexT 4.1.

It is made out of high-carbon steel and is covered with an anti-radar paint. It is the fire control radar component of the Sea Viper naval air defence system. It was previously designated PAAMS(S) to distinguish it from the PAAMS system on the Franco- Italian Horizon Class. The SAMPSON multi function radar can detect all types of targets out to a distance of 400 km, and is capable of tracking hundreds of targets at any one time. Sea Viper uses this information to assess and command target priorities, and calculate the optimum launch time for its Aster missiles. History SAMPSON is derived from the Multi-function Electronically Scanned Adaptive Radar (MESAR) programme. MESAR 1 development commenced in 1982 as a partnership between Plessey, Roke Manor Research and the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Plessey was acquired by Siemens in 1989 to become Siemens-Plessey, itself acquired by British Aerospace in 1998. British Aerospace became BAE Systems in November 1999. MESAR 1 trials occurred between 1989 and 1994. MESAR 2 development began in August 1995, of which SAMPSON is a derivative. The Royal Navy intended to deploy the SAMPSON MFR on its version of the Horizon CNGF - a collaboration with France and Italy to produce anti-air warfare frigates. Following delays and complications the UK withdrew and started its own Type 45 programme. The Type 45 destroyers use the SAMPSON radar with the PAAMS missile system, which was also developed for the Horizon frigates (French and Italian ships are to be fitted with the EMPAR MFR). The SAMPSON Radar is made in Cowes, Isle of Wight. Operation The mainmast of showing the SAMPSON multi-function AESA radar Conventional radars, consisting of a rotating transmitter and sensor, have limited power, are vulnerable to enemy jamming and perform only one function - with separate units therefore required for surveillance, tracking and targeting. As an active array, SAMPSON uses software to shape and direct its beam allowing several functions to be carried out at once and, through adaptive waveform control, is virtually immune to enemy jamming. Active arrays have both longer range and higher accuracy than conventional radars. The beam-directing software uses sophisticated algorithms to schedule looks so that the potentially hundreds of active tracks are maintained with maximum accuracy. The SAMPSON uses two planar arrays to provide coverage over only part of the sky; complete coverage is provided by rotating the arrays, essentially similar to the way conventional radar systems operate. This is in contrast to the US AN/SPY-1 system (as used on the Ticonderoga class cruiser and Arleigh Burke class destroyer) or the Dutch APAR system (as used on the Royal Netherlands Navy's De Zeven Provinci√´n class frigates, the German Navy's Sachsen class frigates, and the Royal Danish Navy's Ivar Huitfeldt class frigates), which use multiple arrays fixed in place to provide continuous coverage of the entire sky. Whilst this may seem to be a disadvantage, the SAMPSON radar rotates at 30 revolutions per minute, with two back-to-back arrays, meaning no part of the sky lacks coverage for more than one half second on average - the precise time varies as the beams can also be swept back and forth electronically. In addition, the use of a smaller number of arrays allows the system to be much lighter, allowing placement of the arrays at the top of a prominent mast rather than on the side of the superstructure as in the Dutch or US ships. Placing any radar emitter at higher altitude extends the horizon distance, improving performance against low level or sea-skimming targets; SAMPSON is at approximately double the height above the waterline than the arrays of its Dutch or US equivalents. Although precise details of the SAMPSON's performance in this regard are unlikely to enter the public domain, such factors may mitigate the disadvantages of fewer arrays. Some tasks are difficult to combine, for example (long range) volume search takes a lot of radar resources, leaving little room for other tasks such as targeting. Combining volume search with other tasks also results either in slow search rates or in low overall quality per task. Driving parameters in radar performance is time-on-target or observation time per beam. This is why the Royal Navy selected the S1850M Long Range Radar to complement Sampson on the Type 45 destroyers. It is also a reason why the NATO Anti-Air Warfare System study (NAAWS) defined the preferred AAW system as consisting of a complementary Volume Search Radar and MFR. This gives the added advantage that the two systems can use two different radar frequencies; one being a good choice for long range search, the other a good choice for an MFR (as physics makes both tasks difficult to combine). The first Type 45, was launched on February 1, 2006. The ship was fitted with SAMPSON and S1850M radars in 2007. She underwent trials before being commissioned 23 July 2009.

He served in the United States House of Representatives and as Governor of New York. Early life Young was born in Chelsea, Vermont on June 12, 1802. As a child, his family moved to Freeport (now Conesus), Livingston County, New York, where his parents operated an inn. He had only basic schooling but by self-study acquired an education in the classics which enabled him to qualify as a schoolteacher, after which he taught in Livonia, New York. He later studied law with Augustus A. Bennett of East Avon, New York, and Anbrose Bennett of Geneseo, New York. Young was admitted to the bar in 1829, and began a practice in Geneseo. Among the prospective attorneys who later studied under Young was his brother in law James Wood, and Young and Wood later formed a partnership. Start of career He entered politics as a Jacksonian Democrat, but shortly afterward joined the Anti-Masonic Party. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1832. Young was elected as a Whig to the 24th United States Congress, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Philo C. Fuller, holding office from November 1836 to March 3, 1837. In 1840 he was elected to the 27th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843. He was again a member of the Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1845 and 1846. Governor of New York In 1846 Young was the Whig nominee for governor. He defeated incumbent Silas Wright and served one term, January 1847 to December 1848. As governor, Young favored expanding the Erie Canal, oversaw establishment of the state court of appeals, and opposed the Mexican War. He also pardoned farmers who had been imprisoned for participating in the Anti-Rent War. In 1848 Young was defeated for the Whig nomination for governor by Hamilton Fish, who went on to win the general election. Later career In 1848 Young was a delegate to the 1848 national convention. He first backed Henry Clay for president, but supported Zachary Taylor after Taylor was nominated. After Taylor assumed office he rewarded Young with the appointment as Assistant Treasurer of the United States in New York City. Young served until his death in New York City from tuberculosis on April 23, 1852. He was buried at Temple Hill Cemetery in Geneseo. Family In 1833 Young married Ellen Harris of York, New York. They were the parents of four children.

Public transport and key highways in the city are overseen by Transport for West Midlands (TfWM). Railways Vauxhall railway station ‚Äì Birmingham's first ‚Äì in 1837 History The first railway station to open in Birmingham was Vauxhall station, which opened in 1837 as a temporary railway shed. It served as the temporary Birmingham terminus of the Grand Junction Railway from Warrington. Curzon Street railway station opened in 1838 as the permanent terminus in the city and Vauxhall became a goods-only station until it was rebuilt and opened in 1869 under the London & North Western Railway (LNWR). The Curzon Street station entrance hall remains today in its original form, designed by Philip Hardwick, mirroring his design of the Euston Arch at the London terminus of the railway line. It is Grade I listed and is the world's oldest surviving piece of monumental railway architecture. It closed to all railway traffic in 1966. Birmingham New Street station New Street station opened in 1854, and Curzon Street station fell out of passenger use, running only holiday excursions for the public. New Street helped by becoming a hub for railway lines, easing connections between them. Despite this, an extension of New Street station was required in the 1880s so that Midland Railway trains between Derby and Bristol no longer needed to use Camp Hill railway station which opened in 1840. Snow Hill station Snow Hill station was the next major station to open in Birmingham, opening in 1852 as Livery Street station. It connected London Paddington to Wolverhampton Low Level. The station was rebuilt in 1871 to accommodate longer trains and again between 1906 and 1912. The latter scheme was undertaken so that the station could compete better with New Street. Other stations on the line in Birmingham were Soho & Winson Green and Hockley. To alleviate pressure on Snow Hill, Moor Street station was opened in 1909 as a terminus for the North Warwickshire lines. The two stations were linked by tunnel which closed in 1968, only to be reopened in 1987 under British Rail, when the new Moor Street station was completed. The 1960s Beeching cuts stated Snow Hill station as being unnecessary and the station closed in 1972 along with the line to Wolverhampton Low Level. The station was demolished by 1977, with only the original gates and booking hall sign surviving. However, in the 1980s, British Rail decided to re-open Snow Hill station as part of the cross-city transport plan for Birmingham. It reopened in 1987 as part of a completely redeveloped site with new office buildings replacing the original hotel, and multi-storey car parking over the station concourses. In 2011 a new station entrance was opened linking Snow Hill station to the Jewellery Quarter, on the other side of the A41 Queensway inner distribution road. Moor street station as of 2010 and after renovation In 1986, Moor Street was relocated adjacent to the original station. However, in 2002, the original Moor Street station was renovated by the Birmingham Alliance and Chiltern Railways at a cost of ¬£11 million, and converted into a shopping and refreshment area connected to the new platforms. The Harborne Branch Line opened in 1875, connecting New Street to the outlying suburb of Harborne. A connection to the LNWR was created at Monument Lane. The branch terminated at Harborne railway station. The line began to suffer from falling passenger numbers, largely due to the increasing popularity of buses but also due to train delays as a result of congestion of routes at New Street station. Icknield Port Road station closed in 1931, and the other stations closed to passengers on 26 November 1934. The last passenger train to run on the line was an enthusiasts' special on 3 June 1950. The line closed to freight traffic on 4 November 1963. In 1978 the Cross-City Line came into being, comprising the former Midland Railway line between Redditch and New Street via Selly Oak and the London and North Western Railway Line between New Street and Lichfield. It connects Sutton Coldfield, which was absorbed into Birmingham in 1974, with the Birmingham city centre. This line provides the only passenger service to Sutton Coldfield; the Sutton Park Line, opened in 1879 and closed to passengers in 1965, is still in use as a freight- only line avoiding central Birmingham. Mainline services A CrossCountry Class 220 Voyager at Birmingham New Street hub A large number of railway lines meet at Birmingham New Street railway station, which is a hub of the UK rail network and is the calling point for most intercity services to and from Birmingham. Trains to London Marylebone operated by Chiltern Railways stop at Moor Street station, and most continue to Snow Hill station. New Street Station has been redeveloped in a ¬£500 million scheme named Gateway Plus. The project improved passenger facilities and increased passenger capacity at the station, which had been running at over double its capacity. The first stage of the development was completed in April 2013, when the old concourse was closed. The project was completed in 2015. Phase One of High Speed 2 is to have its first spur to Birmingham linking with London. Phase Two will create new high speed links from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester. Since New Street does not have sufficient capacity for the new high-speed trains, a new dedicated high-speed railway station will be built at Curzon Street, partly on the site of the former station. A new station called Birmingham Interchange will be opened adjacent to Birmingham International to serve the city's airport and the National Exhibition Centre. Local services Map of the passenger rail and tram network in the Birmingham & West Midlands area There is a network of rail services within Birmingham and the West Midlands county, operated by West Midlands Trains and supported by Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) (formerly called Centro). During 2014/15, there were nearly 51 million rail passenger journeys in the TfWM area. Birmingham has the highest proportion of rail commuters in England outside London. In the past few decades the proportion of journeys into central Birmingham by rail has grown sharply: 27% of journeys into Birmingham city centre in the peak hours were made by rail in 2012, compared to 17% in 2001, and 12% in 1991. Most of the Birmingham and West Midlands County local commuter lines are centred on New Street station, including the Cross-City Line, the Chase Line and the Coventry-Wolverhampton Line. Three commuter routes, known collectively as the Snow Hill Lines, run through Snow Hill and Moor Street stations. Plans are being pursued to restore local passenger services to the Camp Hill Line in southern Birmingham, which is currently freight only, by constructing new chords into Birmingham Moor Street station. This would also allow for new local services on the lines from Birmingham to and . Light Rail West Midlands Metro West Midlands Metro tram The West Midlands Metro is a light- rail tram system promoted by TfWM. The system currently has one line which connects Birmingham to Wolverhampton via West Bromwich and Wednesbury. The original line from Wolverhampton to Birmingham Snow Hill was opened in 1999. In 2016, the line was extended across Birmingham city-centre from Birmingham Snow Hill to Birmingham New Street station, it is planned to extend it further from New Street to Centenary Square and then on to Five Ways and Edgbaston, another line connecting the Eastside of the city-centre is also planned. There are further plans to extend the system across Birmingham and the West Midlands. Birmingham Corporation Tramways Birmingham Corporation Tramways operated a network of tramways in Birmingham from 1904 until 1953. It was the largest narrow-gauge tramway network in the UK, and was built to a gauge of . It was the fourth largest tramway network in the UK behind London, Glasgow and Manchester. Underground system In the early 1950s, the government planned to protect essential communications by building a series of hardened underground telephone exchanges. Construction of the Anchor exchange in Birmingham started in 1953 with a cover story that a new underground rail network was being built. Work progressed until 1956 when the public were told the project was no longer economic; instead Birmingham got its underpasses through the city to help relieve congestion. An underground exchange and tunnel system 100 ft below Newhall Street had been completed at a cost ¬£4 million. The main tunnel runs from Anchor to Midland ATE in Hill Street, from there the tunnel continued under New Street Station and on to the exchange in Essex Street. More recently, the Conservative-Lib-Dem alliance running Birmingham City Council proposed an underground system as an alternative to expansion of the Midland Metro. A ¬£150,000 feasibility study was conducted, looking at the benefits and drawbacks of a state-of-the-art, ¬£3 billion underground system serving the city. Upon the outcome of the report, the city council backed plans for a street metro system. Buses and coaches 84% of public transport use in the West Midlands is by bus.Centro: Bus Services There are approximately 50 operators of registered local bus services in the West Midlands. The largest bus operator in the area is National Express West Midlands, which accounts for over 80% of all journeys. The company changed its name from Travel West Midlands in 2008 as a part of National Express' re- branding. National Express West Midlands operates a large network based on a range of services radiating out of Birmingham City Centre and the route 11 bus service, the longest urban bus service in EuropeHidden Europe which chiefly follows the A4040 circular road. The new Birmingham coach station, on the site of the former Digbeth coach station Most of the network is operated on a commercial basis, with some services (usually evenings and Sundays) supported by TfWM. Smaller operators provide a range of services, either in competition with National Express West Midlands or under contract to TfWM. These include Diamond West Midlands and The Green Bus. Medium distance bus services from Birmingham include First Midland Red operating services to Worcester and Redditch. Arriva Midlands operates services to Tamworth and Kingsbury in Staffordshire. Johnsons Coach & Bus Travel operate longer distance bus services from the south of the conurbation such as the 20 to Stratford-upon- Avon and the 150/X50 to Redditch. Despite the large number of buses serving Birmingham City Centre there is no longer a bus station. Instead buses terminate at bus stops on roads surrounding the city centre which are given codes assigned by area (e.g. Moor Street Interchange = MS*). The airport can also be reached via an express bus service from Coleshill Parkway station, on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line which run four times per hour and take around fifteen minutes. Alternatively, National Express West Midlands runs a regular bus service from the City Centre. The number X1 from Moor Street Queensway to Coventry runs via the airport and the National Exhibition Centre. Birmingham is also a major hub in the National Express coach network, whose headquarters are in Birmingham. The group operates services from its hub at Birmingham coach station, a new coach station on the site of the former Digbeth coach station. A temporary coach station was located in nearby Oxford Street whilst building work was undertaken.Bus and Coach: Birmingham's coach station saga The company's flagship NXL Shuttle service operates services to London with frequent services to all major airports and cities in Britain. Many of these are cross-country services operating from north to south, for which Birmingham provides interchange facilities. Birmingham is also served by Megabus coaches that stop at Brunel Street, west of New Street station. Roads Spaghetti Junction The M40 motorway connects to London via Oxford. The M6 motorway also connects Birmingham to London (via the M1) and the south, and the north-west of England and Scotland. Junction 6 of the M6 is also one of Birmingham's landmarks, and probably the most notable motorway junction in the UK, Spaghetti Junction, which is officially called the Gravelly Hill Interchange. Other motorways are: * The A38(M) which links Spaghetti Junction to the city centre *The M5, connecting Birmingham to the south-west of England *The M42, which connects Birmingham to Tamworth and the East Midlands *The M6 Toll, which enables through traffic on the M6 to bypass Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Birmingham, unlike London and Manchester, does not have a single orbital motorway. Instead, three motorways form a box which surrounds most of the city. These are: *The M42 which forms the southern and eastern sections. In the middle, the M40 terminates, which has its junction built with priority for traffic going from the M40 to the M42 west, instead of M42 east- west priority. The M40 goes off south to Warwick, Oxford, High Wycombe, Uxbridge and London. *The M5 which forms the western section. *The M6 which forms the northern section. The M5 terminates on the M6. A38(M) Aston Expressway Other major roads passing through Birmingham include: *The A34 from Manchester to Winchester *The A38 from Mansfield to Bodmin *The A41 from London to Birkenhead *The A45 from Birmingham to Thrapston (formerly to Felixstowe) *The A47 from Birmingham to Great Yarmouth *The A4540 'Middleway' ring road *The A4040 Outer Ring Road Clean Air Zone Birmingham is planning to introduce a Clean Air Zone in July 2020, which will involve charging polluting vehicles to travel into the city centre (all roads within the A4540 ring road).https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20076/pollution/1763/a_clean_air_zone_for_birminghamhttps://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20076/pollution/1763/a_clean_air_zone_for_birmingham/3 Poor air quality kills around 900 people a year in Birmingham and the government has ordered the city to reduce pollution. The daily charge will be ¬£8 for petrol cars built before 2006 and diesel cars built before 2015, and ¬£50 for lorries and coaches. The money would be used for public transport. The plan was backed by the British Heart Foundation, which said ‚ÄúIn order to protect everyone living in Birmingham, it is vital that bold action is taken on air quality. A Clean Air Zone in the city will be a crucial step forward, as this is the most cost-effective way to tackle polluted air and minimise the damaging effect that it has on people‚Äôs heart health.\\" Air History British European Airways' Bristol 171 Mk 3A at London Gatwick on the scheduled passenger service from Birmingham in 1955 Birmingham's first airport was Castle Bromwich Aerodrome, which operated from 1909‚Äì1958. Another opened as Elmdon Airport on 8 July 1939 and continues to operate, as Birmingham Airport. A heliport operated adjacent to Baskerville House in the 1950s. Current Part of Terminal 1, the runway is seen beyond. Birmingham is served by Birmingham Airport in the Borough of Solihull to the east of Birmingham, which is the seventh-busiest (2013) by passenger traffic in the UK and has flights to many European destinations such as Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Rome, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul as well as number of long haul services including New York City, Toronto, Orlando, Canc√∫n, Punta Cana, Montego Bay, Barbados, Dubai, Doha, Islamabad, Delhi, Amritsar, Goa, Phuket, and Ashgabat. Charter flights to Beijing were launched in the summer of 2014 following the completion of the runway extension. The airport is served by the railway network at Birmingham International railway station, nearby in the same Borough. The airport and railway station are linked by the AirRail Link, originally a Maglev system, since converted to a cable-hauled SkyRail people mover. Train services are provided by Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains. The AirRail Link connects Birmingham Airport and airport railway station -- a pair of cable-driven people movers. Bus services operate from the airport to Coleshill Parkway railway station on the Birmingham ‚Äì Leicester railway line. This link improves access to the East Midlands as well as providing further links to North Warwickshire and South-east Staffordshire. The airport has two major bus services running into Birmingham: the X1 (Birmingham ‚Äì Airport ‚Äì Coventry), which operates 24 hours a day and X12 bus (Birmingham - Chelmsley Wood‚Äì Airport ‚Äì Solihull). The majority of bus services from the airport are run by National Express West Midlands (formerly known as Travel West Midlands) with other Warwickshire-funded services such as the 75. Canals Gas Street Basin Birmingham's canal network was built during the Industrial Revolution to transport heavy goods and the city remains at the hub of the country's canal network. Canals run for within the city, of which most are still navigable. Birmingham is often lauded as having more miles of canal than Venice, true by a margin of . Birmingham however includes many semi-urban parts and is a far larger city than Venice making for a much lower canal density (concentration). The type of waterway is inland providing the main access to few properties. This contrasts to Venice's broad coastal canals providing the main means of access, surrounded by a lagoon of the Adriatic Sea. By water volume (taking into account depths), Birmingham has more cubic metres of water in its canals than any other city in the world. Extensive regeneration of canals has taken place since the 1980s, including dredging to enable the smooth passage of narrowboats, reconstruction and construction of canalside housing. 2010s developments include the Eastside area of Digbeth and the area within Icknield Port Loop. Canals in Birmingham include: * Birmingham Canal Navigations network, including the BCN Main Line and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal * Worcester & Birmingham Canal (parts of) * The Grand Union Canal (parts of) Birmingham has reservoirs to feed its canals, including: *Edgbaston Reservoir *Lifford Reservoir There are no navigable rivers: the Rea, on which the city was founded, is little more than a culverted stream, and the Tame, which passes through some northern suburbs, is not navigable. The River Cole, which runs through the south-east of the city through to the north-west, is too shallow for anything bigger than a raft. Birmingham public transport statistics The average time which public transport users in Birmingham spend commuting per day (as such, chiefly to and from work) on a weekday is 94 min; 38% of such users commmute for more than 120 minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transport is 17 min; 27% of such users wait for over 20 minutes. The average distance people ride in a trip with public transport is 6.6 km; 10% of users travel more than 12 km in any leg of their public transport journey per day. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

They are named after the protagonist, George Sherston; a young Englishman of the upper middle-class, living immediately before and during the First World War. The books are, in fact, 'fictionalised autobiography', wherein the only truly fictional things are the names of the characters. Sassoon himself is represented by Sherston. A comparison of the Sherston memoirs to Sassoon's later, undiluted autobiographical trilogy (The Old Century, The Weald of Youth, and Siegfried's Journey) shows their strict similarity, and it is generally accepted that all six books constitute a composite portrait of the author, and of his life as a young man. (Sassoon remarked, however, that his alter-ego personified only one-fifth of his actual personality. Unlike his author, Sherston has no poetic inclinations; nor does he deal with homosexuality - an act which was illegal at the time Sassoon was writing.) The Sherston trilogy won high acclaim, and Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man took the Hawthornden Prize for Literature for 1928. The three books were printed together in one volume, The Memoirs of George Sherston, in 1937.

Its membership is the largest of the five main BSA divisions (Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Venturing, Exploring and Sea Scouting). Cub Scouting is part of the worldwide Scouting movement and aims to promote character development, citizenship training, personal fitness, and leadership. Origins Detroit, Michigan. Cub Scouts with flag standards at the British Blitz Scout meeting, 1942 Cub Scout in uniform, 1968 As early as 1911, Ernest Thompson Seton had developed a prototype program he named Cub Scouts of America that was never implemented. James E. West felt that having BSA divisions for younger boys (those under 12; the \\"younger boy problem\\") would draw away boys from the core program, which was Scout troops focused on the 12- to 17-year-old age group; thus he opposed such a program for some time. In spite of this, unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as Junior Troops or Cadet Corps. The BSA obtained the rights to Lord Baden-Powell's The Wolf Cub Handbook in 1916 and used it in unofficial Wolf Cub programs starting in 1918. This led to an issue with Daniel Carter Beard who felt that the use of the British book was nearly disloyal to the United States of America. West encouraged the formation of the Boy Rangers of America, a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an American Indian theme. The Boy Rangers used the Scout Law and their Chief Guide, Emerson Brooks, was a Boy Scout commissioner in Montclair, New Jersey. The BSA finally began some experimental Cub units in 1928 and in 1930 the BSA began registering the first Cub Scout packs, and the Boy Rangers were absorbed. The British Cubbing program used elements of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book series, with the Cubmaster taking the role of Akela and the assistant Cubmaster the role of Baloo. The American program also syncretized American Indian elements, with all Cub Scouts belonging to the Webelos tribe, symbolized by the Arrow of Light and led by Akela. Webelos was also a portmanteau meaning Wolf, Bear, Lion, Scout; the name was later given a backronym of \\"WE'll BE LOyal Scouts\\". The initial rank structure was Wolf, Bear and Lion, with ages of 9, 10 and 11. Dens of six to eight Cubs were entirely led by a Scout holding the position of den chief. Aims, methods, and purposes The Aims of Cub Scouting are the same as the other divisions‚Äîcharacter, citizenship, personal fitness, and leadership. The Methods of Cub Scouting # Living the Ideals # Belonging to a Den # Advancement # Family Involvement # Activities # Serving the Neighborhood # Blue Uniform # Working for badges The Purposes of Cub Scouting are # Character Development # Spiritual Growth # Good Citizenship # Sportsmanship and Fitness # Family Understanding # Respectful Relationships # Personal Achievement # Friendly Service # Fun and Adventure # Preparation for ScoutsWolf Den Leader Guide, 2018 printing, Boy Scouts of America, page 5, (2018), Ideals On June 1, 2015, the Cub Scout Promise and the Law of the Pack were retired and replaced by the Scout Oath and Scout Law. The Cub Scout Motto continues to be used. The Cub Scout sign, two raised fingers of the right hand, identifies the youth as a Cub Scout and the two fingers stand for the Scout Oath and Law. The Cub Scout salute, two fingers of the right hand raised to the edge of the cap or eyebrow, is used to show respect for the country when saluting the flag of the United States. The Cub Scout handshake, first two fingers along the inside of the other Scout's wrist, is used to help each other remember and obey the Scout Oath and Law.Wolf Cub Scout Handbook, 2018 printing, Boy Scouts of America, pages 14-20, (2018), Organization A meeting of the Cub Scouts at the Ida B. Wells Housing Project, Chicago The Cub Scout pack is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the pack, the chartered organization, and the BSA. The pack meets once a month, providing a program for Cub Scouts, leaders, parents and other family members attending. The pack is led by a Cubmaster with one or more assistant Cubmasters. The pack committee is a group of adults, led by the pack committee chair, who plan the pack program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration. The pack trainer is responsible for ensuring that all of the pack leaders are trained and for maintaining training records. Cub Scouts who join a pack are assigned to dens with ideally six to eight members, usually based on age: Lion Scouts (kindergarten), Tiger Scouts (first grade), Wolf Scouts (second grade), Bear Scouts (third grade), and Webelos Scouts (fourth and fifth grades). Dens meet weekly or biweekly under the direction of the adult den leader. A Cub Scout is elected to the denner position to provide basic leadership to the den. A Scout or Venturer holding the den chief position may assist the den leader in activities. Den meetings are planned around a particular adventure being worked on for rank advancement and may include games, handicrafts, hikes and other outdoor fun while also preparing for the next pack meeting. Webelos is an acronym meaning \\"We'll Be Loyal Scouts\\". According to the Bear Cub Scout Book of 1954, the name originally came from the initial letters of \\"wolf, bear, lion, Scout\\", the rank of \\"Lion Cub Scout\\" was dropped in 1967, however was used again in 2017 with the launch of the pilot kindergarten program of the same name which became a full-fledged part of the program in 2018. Packs with a large number of Webelos Scouts sometimes divide them into Webelos I and Webelos II dens, to keep their den from previous years intact. Starting in 2017, fifth graders work on the formalized rank of Arrow of Light, so this I and II distinction may no longer be necessary. Webelos dens spend much of their time learning about Scout customs, including the Scout Law and Oath. Many packs are formally associated with a Scout troop for mutual support‚Äîthe troop provides assistance to the pack with activities such as campouts and ceremonies and in time, the Webelos Scouts cross over to the troop. The Lone Cub Scout program serves youth who cannot take part in a nearby Cub Scout pack on a regular basis because of such factors as distance, weather, time, disability or similar issues. In October 2017, The Boy Scouts of America announced that girls would be welcomed into the Cub Scout program in single gender dens but co-ed packs. 77,000 girls joined nationwide creating packs in California, among other places. Uniform The uniform gives a Cub Scout visibility and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community. The neckerchief, the neckerchief slide and the belt buckle uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Scouts and Venturers. In all cases, shirts are tucked in. Youth uniforms Wolf Cubs in Virginia (red color being phased in for hat and neckerchief) Lions wear a unique uniform consisting of a blue t-shirt with lion logo on front, blue web belt, blue cap with lion logo, and optional yellow neckerchief and slide. Tigers wear the Cub Scout uniform; it is accompanied by orange topped socks, orange neckerchief, neckerchief slide with the Tiger logo, the cap with an orange panel and Tiger emblem and the blue belt with Tiger emblem on the buckle. Wolves wear the Cub Scout uniform and the Wolf cap with yellow or red panel and Wolf logo and the yellow or red neckerchief and the neckerchief slide with Wolf logo. Bears wear the Cub Scout uniform and a cap with light blue panel with Bear logo. The light blue neckerchief and the neckerchief slide have the Bear logo. Webelos Scouts wear the Scouts BSA field uniform with blue shoulder loops. The Webelos cap is green with a plaid panel and the oval Webelos emblem; the plaid is made up of the Cub Scouting blue and gold and the Scouts BSA red and green. The neckerchief is plaid with the Webelos logo and is worn with the slide with Webelos emblem. Webelos wearing the Scout uniform may choose to use the Webelos belt buckle with either the blue Cub Scout or the green Scout belt; Cub Scout belt loop recognitions, however, fit only the blue belt. The Webelos den may elect to wear a den emblem in place of the den number; the patches are the same as the Scout patrol patches. Scouter uniforms Adult leaders wear the basic Scout field uniform. Female leaders of dens below Webelos level have the option of the classic female Cub Scouter uniform with blue web belt. Leaders that wear the tan uniform shirt wear blue shoulder loops on the epaulets, Centennial or Switchbacks pants or shorts, and the Scout web or leather belt. If a neckerchief is worn, male leaders wear the Cub Scout leader neckerchief (if he is a Tiger Cub leader or Cub Scout den leader or assistant den leader), Webelos leader neckerchief (if he is a Webelos den leader or assistant den leader), International adult neckerchief, National Eagle Scout Association neckerchief (if he earned the Eagle Scout rank as a youth), Wood Badge neckerchief, or Wood Badge Tartan neckerchief (if he has completed Wood Badge training), with the appropriate neckerchief slide or woggle. Pack leaders wear the olive visor cap. Den leaders wear the same visored cap as the youth they serve, if the den chooses to wear a cap. The Scouter dress uniform is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions. Advancement and recognition Advancement is one of the methods used to promote the aims of character development, citizenship training, personal fitness, and leadership. Everything a Cub Scout does in the advancement program is intended to achieve these aims and aid in personal growth. On June 1, 2015, Cub Scouting changed the advancement system to an \\"adventure\\" system, including required and elective adventures for all ranks. Lion, Tiger, Wolf, and Bear Cubs earn activity belt loops for each completed adventure, while Webelos earn activity pins which can be worn on the cap or on the Webelos colors. Lion badge Kindergartners work toward the Lion badge. The Lion badge is earned by completing five adventures. Outside of the requirements, Lion Scouts can also complete any number of seven elective adventures of their den's or family's choosing. Lions do not earn the Bobcat badge. This is a new rank for Cub Scouts introduced in 2018. Bobcat badge All youth beginning in first grade will first work on their Bobcat badge to complete the Cub Scout joining requirements, which include knowing and reciting the Scout Oath and Scout Law and knowing the Cub Scout motto and salute. Once the Bobcat badge requirements have been completed, the Cub Scout will continue with the age appropriate program. Tiger, Wolf, and Bear badges Cub Scouts in first grade work toward the Tiger badge, while those in second grade work toward the Wolf badge, and those in third grade work toward the Bear badge. Cub Scouts at all three levels must complete six required adventures and one of thirteen elective adventures with their den or family, as well as completing age-specific cyber-safety exercises (called the Cyber Chip) and exercises to help prevent child abuse with their family. The Cyber Chip and abuse prevention requirements must be completed annually, although the Cyber Chip may be waived if the family does not have internet access at home or otherwise readily available. The remaining elective adventures may be completed throughout the rest of the school year. Webelos Scouts Cub Scouts in fourth and fifth grades work toward the Webelos (pronounced \\"wee-buh-lohs\\" as the singular as well as the plural, the word originally was an acronym for the previous, now discontinued hierarchy Wolf/Bear/Lion/Scout with vowels added, and is now said to be short for \\"WE'll BE LOyal Scouts\\"). Initially, Webelos work toward the Webelos badge and Arrow of Light. A Cub Scout may begin work toward the Arrow of Light only after earning the Webelos badge; however, a new Cub Scout first joining a pack while in fifth grade may immediately begin working toward the Arrow of Light. =Webelos Scout badge= To earn the Webelos Scout badge, the Cub Scout must complete five required adventures, two of eighteen elective adventures, and the Cyber Chip and child abuse prevention exercises. As with previous years, the Cyber Chip can be waived if the family does not have easy access to the internet. Webelos Scouts wearing the blue Cub Scout uniform wear a Webelos badge of the same size and shape as the previous ranks, and can be placed on the uniform where the Tiger Cub badge goes; Webelos Scouts wearing the tan Scout shirt wear an oval-shaped Webelos badge, which is the same size as the Scout rank badges. =Arrow of Light= The Arrow of Light award is the highest rank award available to Cub Scouts. To earn the Arrow of Light, the Cub Scout must complete four required adventures, three of eighteen elective adventures, and the Cyber Chip and child abuse prevention exercises. The Cyber Chip exercises can be waived if the family does not have easy access to the internet. Earning the Arrow of Light allows a youth to join a Scout troop prior at ten years of age instead of eleven. The requirements for the Arrow of Light overlap significantly with the requirements for the first rank in Scouts BSA, the Scout rank. Recipients of the Arrow of Light thus have an advantage in earning the Scout rank soon after joining a Scout troop. The Arrow of Light award is one of the few Cub Scout awards that can be worn on a Scout uniform. Both Cub Scouts and Scouts wear the Arrow of Light badge below the left pocket. Adults wear the square-knot version of the badge above the left pocket. Religious emblems Several religious emblems programs are administered by various religious institutions and recognized, but not sponsored, by the BSA. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot that can also be worn on the Scouting uniform. Leader recognition Cub Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Den Leader Award, the Scouter's Training Award, and the Cubmaster's Training Key are available. These awards were standardized to more closely align with the BSA's other programs in 2012, removing most of the distinctive Cub Scout level awards such as Tiger Cub Den Leader's Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Webelos Den Leader's Training Award (discontinued December 2012), the Cubmaster's Training Award (discontinued December 2013), the Cub Scouter's Training Award (discontinued December 2013), and the Pack Trainer Award (discontinued December 2013). The Scouter's Training Award replaced the Cub Scouter Award, and the Cubmaster's Training Key replaced the Cubmaster's Training Award. The Pack Trainer Award had previously replaced the Den Leader Coach Award, which was officially discontinued on December 31, 2008. Any awards earned prior to the date of their retirement can still be worn. These awards are recognized by a certificate, medal, and an embroidered square knot insignia. Den Chiefs may earn the Den Chief Service Award. Program and activities Each pack has a number of annual events such as the pinewood derby, raingutter regatta, the space derby, gold rush, the blue and gold banquet and Scout Sunday or Scout Sabbath. Several structured camping activities are available in the Cub Scout program. The pack overnighter is a pack-organized camping activity that provides Cub Scouts with positive outdoor experiences. Cub Scout day camp or twilight camp is an accredited, organized, one- to five-day program for Cub Scouts using trained leadership at an approved site, and is usually held during daylight or early evening hours, but not overnight. Cub Scout resident camp is an organized, accredited overnight camping program covering at least two nights and conducted under trained leadership in an established Scout camp operated by the council. The Webelos den overnight camp introduces the Scout and parents to the camping program, under the leadership of the Webelos den leader. Joint campouts with a local Scout troop for second-year Webelos can help to strengthen ties between the pack and troop and facilitate the transition from Webelos to Scouts. The Soccer and Scouting program is designed to involve Hispanic youth and families in the Cub Scout program, instructing Scouts in both soccer and Cub Scout values. Alcohol is prohibited at all Cub Scout events. A number of \\"high-risk\\" outdoor activities are banned by BSA (including Cubs), and others are limited to special programs. Paintball, lasertag, hunting, rodeo, fireworks, and bungee-jumping are among prohibited activities. Training Fast Start Training is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Cub Scout program. Fast Start is self-paced and provided as a video or online. Youth Protection Training is required for all adult leaders and must be recertified per local council policy. Basic Leader Training consists of the online This is Scouting course and Leader Specific Training. This is Scouting is a common core program for all adult leaders in the Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Varsity Scouting, and Venturing divisions. Leader Specific Training is provided for the Tiger Cub den leader, Cub Scout den leader, Webelos den leader, Cubmaster, pack committee chairman and assistants. Once Basic Leader Training is completed, the leader is awarded a Trained emblem for uniform wear. At least one adult on a pack overnight campout must attend the Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO) in order to properly understand camping requirements. Leaders for day camp and resident camp programs must be trained and certified by the National Camping School. Supplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of leaders from the district, at a Pow-Wow or University of Scouting program offered by the local council and at National Cub Scouting Conferences held at the Philmont Scout Ranch and the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base. Wood Badge is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training (usually presented as two three-day weekends) and an application phase of several months. When training is complete, leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief and woggle. Training is also provided for all new den chiefs. Notes :AThe Webelos badge and Arrow of Light use the same pool of eighteen elective adventures. A Cub Scout may not use the elective adventures completed for the Webelos badge toward the Arrow of Light badge. :BWhile any religious emblem may be earned as a Cub Scout and worn as a Scout, these are administered and awarded by religious institutions and are not considered BSA awards as such. :CNeck medallions were previously also awarded, but discontinued in 2001.

Following a successful career as a musician which began in the late 1940s, he began to focus on dramatic acting parts in the late 1960s, which led him to be cast in a role that gained him additional fame to a younger generation. This new chapter in his career began in 1970 when he originated the character of Doug Williams on NBC's Days of Our Lives, which he continues to play regularly to date on the serial. Career Hayes was a singer on the Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca variety show Your Show of Shows in the early 1950s. During the Davy Crockett craze in 1955, three recorded versions of the Ballad of Davy Crockett were in the top 30. Hayes' version was the most popular: It was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks,Joel Whitburn, Top Pop Singles, 12th edn, 2009. sold over two million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He also starred on Broadway in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Me and Juliet (1953). He had other small hits in the 1950s including \\"The Berry Tree\\" and covers of \\"High Noon\\" and \\"Wringle, Wrangle\\"; the latter was his only other Hot 100 hit, reaching #33 in 1957. On Days of Our Lives, Hayes was introduced as a convict who was also a lounge singer. The character of Doug returned in 1986 and 1987 as well as 1993 and 1996. Most recently, he has been on the show since 1999. His character was killed off in the spring of 2004 by Dr. Marlena Evans. In an elaborate plot hatched by head writer James E. Reilly, Doug turned up alive on a tropical island and went home to his wife. In 2017, World by the Tail, a documentary about Bill Hayes's life, was released and made available for his fans to watch online. On June 27, 2017, while present in the show's audience, Hayes was featured in an impromptu interview on a web special for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon; in his heyday, he had been a guest on the Johnny Carson-hosted version of the show. Personal life Hayes graduated from DePauw University with majors in music and English and became a member of Lambda Chi Alpha. Hayes was previously married to Mary Hobbs from 1947 to 1969; they had five children. He has been married to Days of our Lives co-star Susan Seaforth Hayes since 1974. Their relationship was so popular that they were featured on the cover of Time in 1976, the only soap opera stars to hold that distinction to date. In 2005, the couple published their joint autobiography, Like Sands Through the Hourglass. The couple also supports the West Texas Rehab Center, hosting the annual telethon in Abilene, Texas.

It was depopulated in 1943 along with the town of Hanford to make room for the nuclear production facility known as the Hanford Site. Prior to the arrival of white settlers, the land was inhabited by the Wanapum Indians, a tribe closely related to the Palouse, Yakama, and Nez Perce tribes. The first white settlement at White Bluffs was in 1861. The original townsite was located on the east bank of the Columbia River in Franklin County, near present-day Area 100H of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. A ferry was built to accommodate traffic across the Columbia headed for the gold rush in British Columbia. By the early 1890s the population had grown and the town expanded to the west bank of the Columbia in Benton County. The state government authorized a \\"colonization\\" project in 1921 to build 99 homes for returning World War I veterans, but abandoned it in 1925. When U.S. government seizures of homes of White Bluffs residents occurred beginning in March 1943, some homes were seized immediately for government office buildings. Residents were given from three days to two months to abandon their homes. Homes and orchards were burned by the government to clear the site. The remains of some 177 persons buried at the White Bluffs Cemetery were moved on May 6, 1943, to the East Prosser Cemetery, some 30 miles (50 km) away.http://www.interment.net/data/us/wa/benton/white_bluffs.htm At the time of the government destruction of the town of White Bluffs, production of pears, apples, vegetables, and grapes for wine production were primary sources of livelihood. Today, almost nothing remains of the town. A U.S. Department of Energy photo gallery containing various White Bluffs pictures was released on June 15, 2008.

The valley was part of the Rancho San Francisco Mexican land grant. Located in Los Angeles County, its main population center is the city of Santa Clarita which includes the communities of Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, and Valencia. Adjacent unincorporated communities include Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, Val Verde, and the new master planned community of Newhall Ranch. Geography The Santa Clarita Valley is bordered by the Lake Piru area, including the community of Val Verde, Los Padres National Forest, and Castaic Lake to the northwest, Sierra Pelona Mountains and Angeles National Forest to the north and northeast, San Gabriel Mountains to the east and southeast, and Santa Susana Mountains to the south and southwest, and Ventura County and the Santa Clara River Valley to the west. To the west-northwest lies the Topatopa Mountains. Santa Clarita Valley is connected to a wide array of other nearby valleys: the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Basin via Newhall Pass to the south; Antelope Valley via CA 14 through Soledad Pass to the northeast; the San Joaquin Valley via I-5 through Tejon Pass to the northwest, and Leona Valley via San Francisquito and Bouquet canyons. Downstream lies the Santa Clara River Valley, which was given the moniker Heritage Valley by the tourism bureau representing Piru, Fillmore, and Santa Paula. Upstream is Soledad Canyon which contains the communities of Vincent, Acton, Ravenna, and Agua Dulce. The valley is part of a \\"wind-tunnel- like-corridor\\" that connects the high desert with the Oxnard Plain on the coast. This funnels the Santa Ana winds which spreads wildfires and has been called one of the \\"most dangerous wind and fire corridors in Southern California.\\" This served to spread the Maria Fire, one of the 2019 California wildfires.

In addition, the nomenclature ‚Äì being a mixture of indigenous terms and words applied by English and French speakers since before the colonisation of Africa ‚Äì makes the picture complex and even confusing. The Mandinka people speak varieties from the first two groups; the differences between the western and eastern branches manifest themselves primarily phonetically.

The character was portrayed by actress Susan Lucci from her debut on January 16, 1970, until the last broadcast television episode on September 23, 2011. Erica is 15 years old when All My Children debuted in 1970. Lucci was expected to guest star on Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children in 2013, but the appearance never came to fruition due to the show's second cancellation. Erica is considered to be the most popular character in soap opera history. TV Guide calls her \\"unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV,\\" and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\". TV Guide. pp. 14 - 15. Character creation Background Agnes Nixon created Erica Kane in the 1960s as part of the story bible for All My Children, a light-hearted soap opera focusing on social issues and young love. Nixon unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to NBC, then to CBS, and once again to NBC through Procter & Gamble. With Procter & Gamble unable to make room for the new series in its line up, she put All My Children on hold. Nixon became head writer of Another World where she used the model of the Erica character to create a brand new character: Rachel Davis. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \\"precursor to the public\\" but Rachel was a lower-class version. She detailed Rachel's goals as less \\"stratospheric\\" in nature since her primary motivation involved marrying Russ Mathews or a man with money while Erica wanted love, independence, and fame. \\"What Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied,\\" Nixon said. \\"But that dream has been elusive.\\"Simon, p. 28.Hyatt, p. 29. After the success of One Life to Live, a series Nixon created in 1968, ABC asked her to create another soap opera for them. She used the story bible for All My Children to create the new program. The Erica character officially debuted in 1970 once All My Children made it onto the air. Casting Susan Lucci portrayed Erica Kane from 1970 until the show's cancellation in 2011. At the time, soap operas featured mostly older casts. To add a contemporary feel to the show, Nixon focused on younger characters, while also mixing in older ones so as not to lose traditional viewers. The youths on All My Children were Tara Martin (Karen Lynn Gorney), Phillip Brent (Richard Hatch), Chuck Tyler (Jack Stauffer), and Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). For those parts, the show wanted to cast unknown actors. In 1969, Susan Lucci responded to a casting call for All My Children. She initially auditioned for the role of Tara Martin. The \\"character that we were all interested in was not Erica, but Tara,\\" said Doris Quinlan, the show's former executive producer. \\"She was the sweet young ingenue ‚Äî the one with all the problems that everyone was supposed to care about... I certainly couldn't cast [Lucci] as a young, innocent, sweet little Irish girl. That's not what comes out. She's much more sophisticated ‚Äì at least she gives that appearance. She was perfect to play Erica.\\" After a meeting with a casting director, they promised to call her back in six months. One of hundreds of people they called back in, Lucci progressed on from each reading of the part until she received the role. \\"I saw the audition tapes, and she just stood out,\\" said Agnes Nixon. \\"There was never a question, ever.\\" Before being cast as Erica Kane, Lucci did not have much success in her acting career. A casting director discouraged her from pursuing roles on television because her hair, skin, and eyes were too dark. Though Lucci's olive complexion held her back from other acting opportunities, it worked in her favor while up for the role of Erica. \\"Agnes Nixon, the show's creator, really wanted somebody dark to play this part. She has always been ahead of her time,\\" Lucci said. Lucci debuted in episode 10 of the series. In portraying Erica, the actress drew on the \\"self-centered\\" and \\"haughty\\" traits she recognized in herself while in college. Lucci said, \\"I love playing her. I enjoyed playing her when she was a 15-year-old high school girl, the naughty girl in town, and I enjoy playing her now, when she's still the naughty girl, but she's broadened her area of operation to include the entire world.\\" Archetypes Over the years, Erica developed into different character archetypes. Soap operas once featured only one-dimensional characters who were either good or bad. By the 1970s, characters were written with more depth, fitting into archetypes consisting of the young-and-vulnerable romantic heroine, the old-fashioned villain, the rival, the suffering antagonist, Mr. Right, the former playboy, the meddlesome and villainous mother/grandmother, the benevolent mother/grandmother, and the career woman. Erica was established as the rival to Tara Martin's young-and-vulnerable romantic heroine. As the rival, Erica was written as money and status-conscious as well as sexually aggressive. Erica was generally positioned as the antagonist keeping true love pairings, such as Tara and Phillip Brent, apart. By the late 1970s, a different set of character types were established, including the chic suburbanite, the subtle single, the traditional family person, the successful professional, and the elegant socialite. Erica was in the chic suburbanite category which comprised \\"flashy,\\" achievement-oriented characters with little interest in family and friends. Like others in this category, Erica was written as \\"flamboyant, frivolous and carefree, with little commitment other than [her] own selfish enjoyment of life.\\" Overall, Erica is the embodiment of \\"the bitch goddess,\\"Siegel, p. 3. a soap opera archetype that \\"transformed and defined\\" the soap opera genre. Irna Phillips, Nixon, and William J. Bell created the archetype in the 1960s and it became one of their defining legacies. The archetype is an assertive Cinderella who goes after material things. This was a change from the heroines of the radio soap operas who waited to be rescued by men. As the bitch goddess, Erica started out as \\"a conniving teenage vixen\\" and transformed into \\"the femme fatale incarnate.\\" The characters in this category are outrageous, exaggerated, financially disadvantaged and determined to change that. Other characters in this archetype are Lisa Grimaldi (As the World Turns), Rachel Davis (Another World) and Tracy Quartermaine (General Hospital). General Hospitals Luke Spencer later became daytime television's first bitch god. Character development Characteristics Erica is a headstrong and selfish 15-year-old when All My Children begun in 1970.In Lucci's 2005 Associated Press interview, she stated Erica was age 15 when she began portraying the character. Although Nixon designed her as one of the bad characters, she was not intended to come off as evil or menacing. Since Nixon created All My Children as a \\"light hearted\\" soap opera, the series' villains, Erica included, came across as more fun and funny, than wicked.Soares, p. 34. Over time, Erica evolved into a \\"heroine-vixen\\" who still did bad things, but was also a character the audience rooted for. Former associate producer Felicia Minei Behr said, \\"The Erica that [Lucci] started with, was a kid who was one-dimensional, who was the rotten seed, and she turned her into a very fascinating character- the character that everybody loves to hate.\\"Susan Lucci, p. 39. Characterized as the \\"naughty girl in town\\" from the start, her motivations stem from her relationship with her father. Her abandonment by him led her to be written as sexually aggressive with men. She needs to receive love from men to prove she is not unlovable. One of Erica's defining features is her extreme self- centered point of view.Soares, p. 153. Erica is described as \\"imaginative, adventurous, and brilliant\\", yet writers detailed her as appearing \\"scarcely rational enough to cope with adulthood.\\"Spence, p. 117. Despite this, the character represents independence and power. \\"I think of Erica as a go- getter,\\" Lucci said, \\"someone who's impatient to have a terrific life and have it yesterday. I think a lot of people can identify with that.\\"Susan Lucci, p. 91. She always controls her business whether involved with a man or not. Some of the jobs she has been given during her storylines include a high fashion model, a cosmetics tycoon, and a magazine publisher. When Charles Pratt, Jr. took over as head writer of All My Children in 2008, one of his goals for improving the series involved making Erica the focus of the show again. \\"[A]bove all, the show is, and should always revolve around, Erica,\\" he said in an interview with Soap Opera Digest. \\"I can see the temptation to split her off and put her in jail and put her on the run. We did it on Ugly Betty! But to me, she is the Scarlett O'Hara of this show and she must always be that, be the center and the heart of the show. Challenging that character that way, making her the powerful woman she should be, is important.\\" Family When All My Children debuts, the Kane family consists of Erica, her mother, Mona (Frances Heflin), and her absent father, film director Eric Kane (Albert Stratton). Mona spoils Erica to fill the void Eric left behind.Gary Warner, All My Children: The Complete Family Scrapbook, p. 15-119, . Despite this, the writers scripted the relationship between Mona and Erica as tumultuous with Mona disapproving of Erica's antics and Erica blaming Mona for her father's desertion.Soares, p. 105. The relationship is later developed into a strong bond. The writers layered their interactions with \\"raw edges\\" and humor. \\"Erica idealized her father‚Äîwho was a son of a bitch‚Äîand she refused to see that,\\" Heflin said.Siegel, p. 49. Whenever Eric disappoints Erica, she blames her mother. \\"Then, of course, would come the moment of breakdown when she would cry on [Mona's] shoulder,\\" Helfin said. \\"So it's more or less human. Really, more human and less saccharine than most of the mother/children relationships on soaps. It has an awful lot of bit in it.\\" After Mona's death in 1994, the character continues on as a god-like figure Erica looks to for guidance repeatedly throughout the series. From the start of the series, the lack of a relationship with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She is an example of the Nixon staple of the \\"lost daddy's girl.\\"Simon, p. 148. Eric abandons her and her mother before the start of the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. \\"Susan added a lot of Erica's background,\\" Behr said. \\"Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out.\\" In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley. The 1993 arrival of Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) prompted the reveal that, prior to the series' debut, Erica had been raped at age 14 by Eric's friend, film star Richard Fields. Eric had allowed Richard, who had a \\"crush\\" on Erica, to be alone with her and had done nothing to prevent the rape from occurring. A revisitation of the event during Erica's 2004 alcohol intervention storyline introduced the fact Eric had actually offered up Erica for sex with Richard to convince the actor to star in one of Eric's films.All My Children July 5, 2004 episode. Erica represses all memory of the rape until 16-year-old Kendall, a child conceived by it and revealed to be Erica's first born daughter she gave up for adoption to the Harts, appears in 1993.Spence, p. 109. Viewer reaction to the discrepancy created by Erica's having a 16-year-old daughter conceived in a 24-year-old rape prompted the series to immediately adjust Kendall's age to 23. The mother-daughter relationship between Erica and Kendall was designed as antagonistic and complex, with Kendall, unaware of the rape, seeking revenge against Erica in feeling she \\"abandoned\\" her as an infant, while wanting her mother's approval. Kendall's attempted seduction of Erica's love interest, Dimitri Marick, creates conflict between him and Erica, and Kendall also brings Richard Fields to town to torment her mother. Kendall later makes peace with her mother and leaves town in 1995. She returns in 2002, portrayed by a new actress, Alicia Minshew, as Kendall's birth year was revised to 1976. The later story between Erica and Kendall displayed each character's point of view as they both deal with the ramifications of how Kendall's conception traumatized them, which Lucci praised. A reconciliation later occurs for the characters wherein they bond as mother and daughter. In a topical 1973 storyline, Erica aborts the baby she conceives with her first husband, Jeff Martin (Charles Frank). This is the first legal abortion aired on American television since the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. However, Maude Findlay had an abortion on Maude the year before, after New York legalized the practice. Erica was chosen for this storyline as a way to prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice.Siegel, p. 58-9. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. \\"Erica's abortion was simply because she didn't want to have a child, and I think if you do that now, you would perhaps hurt your character,\\" said former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica's knowledge. Inkling Magazine pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because \\"the techniques by which abortion is performed don't exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman's womb.\\" The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica's eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he said, \\"Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is one of my best friends, and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it's only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining.\\" In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg's wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, All My Children let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced to decide whether or not to donate Josh's heart to a seriously ill Kendall. \\"The first thought that came to my mind when I was told the storyline and read the script was Sophie's Choice,\\" said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would \\"haunt\\" Erica because, if Kendall's life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.Soap Opera Digest. January 27, 2009. Erica's youngest child, Bianca Montgomery, enters the series in 1988. At that time, Bianca is Erica's first and only child since the Kendall and Josh characters were not created yet. In the storyline, Erica becomes pregnant with Travis Montgomery's child and develops toxemia. The story was written to inform and educate the audience on the details of the condition.Spence, p. 81. Inkling Magazine looked into the plausibility of her developing toxemia and found it believable. The magazine said, \\"[W]omen who were born small for their gestational age have a higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia during their own pregnancies. The petite form of [Susan Lucci as Erica] seems to fit that description well. Also, given the character's storyline, which included shooting her sister's mother, Goldie, and the attraction she feels for Jack, her husband's brother, she could have had high blood pressure from stress. That hypertension increases the risk of toxemia.\\" Erica overcomes the medical difficulties and gives birth to Bianca. As she grows up, Erica sees her through Reye's syndrome and anorexia nervosa. In 2000, All My Children cast Eden Riegel in the role of a teenage Bianca. The character comes out as a lesbian to her mother. Erica has trouble accepting the revelation, but eventually does. This storyline was inspired by the real life coming out story of Chastity Bono, and the initial reaction by her famous mother Cher. Erica's other relatives include half- siblings Mark Dalton (Mark LaMura) and Silver Kane (Mary LeSeene). In 1977, Mark and Erica begin a romance, which leads Mona to reveal Mark had also been fathered by Eric Kane, who had engaged in an affair with Mark's mother, Maureen Dalton, Eric's secretary. In 1982, while working in New York City as a model, Erica discovers a half-sister named Silver. Unlike Mark, Silver is the product of a secret marriage between Eric and a woman named Goldie. Silver secretly plots against Erica while pretending to form a bond with her. Silver is later exposed as an impostor named Connie, but the real Silver shows up soon after, only to be killed. Marriages and relationships The character has been married to multiple men, some more than once. Seven of her marriages to six different men have been valid, while four of her other marriages are invalid. Generally, the number of times Erica has been married is named as ten, though the total of her valid and invalid marriages, plus her 1991 vow renewal with Adam Chandler, would come up to eleven. Along with the marriages, the character is also given a number of other love interests. The motivation behind the multiple romances stems from the character's need to fill the void her father left when he abandoned her. As the series begins, Erica's romantic role is as the rival keeping the \\"true love\\" pairings apart. The first story she is used this way in is the teenage love quadrangle between Erica, Phillip Brent, Tara Martin, and Chuck Tyler. In that story, Erica is used as one of the devices separating Tara and Phil. She breaks them up in 1970, but does not get him for herself until years later. Other couples she is used as a roadblock for are Jeff Martin and Mary Kennicott, Linc Tyler and Kitty Shae, and Chuck Tyler and Donna Beck. Erica's first two marriages, first to Jeff Martin in 1971 and then to Phil Brent in 1975, end because both men want her as a housewife instead of a career woman. Also, Erica is more interested in marrying them to spite Tara. Lucci described Jeff as a \\"trophy\\" and gaining Phil as \\"a matter of pride for Erica.\\" The marriage to Jeff ends when she leaves him for her modeling manager, Jason Maxwell, who Mona later kills in self-defense.Matelski, p. 52. Erica and Phil marry to give the baby they conceive a name. In the 1970s, pregnancy on a soap opera was romanticized so it was more influenced by the emotions and actions of the characters than by modern medicine. Since Phil and Erica do not conceive their baby for love, they are \\"rewarded\\" with a miscarriage, which was typical of loveless unions in that time.Soares, p. 21-22. Phil wants a divorce after their baby's stillbirth. Though her interest turns to pursuing richer men like Linc Tyler, she refuses to let him go because she does not want Tara to have him. Erica agrees to divorce Phil after his father, Nick Davis, offers her a job as a hostess at his restaurant, the Chateau, in exchange for letting his son go. Erica and Nick develop a romance. The relationship displays antagonistic yet loving qualities. It is the first time Erica meets her match in a man. Erica sees Nick as both a father figure and a lover. Though he loves her, he refuses to marry her, which infuriates Erica. She begins a romance with Tom Cudahay (Richard Shoberg) in the hopes of making Nick jealous. Even though it works, Nick fails to act on his jealousy and instead moves to Chicago. On Erica and Tom's wedding day she hopes he will come back to interrupt the ceremony, but he does not. All My Children shot Tom and Erica's honeymoon on location in St. Croix, the location where Nixon wrote the bible for the series.Matelski, p. 127.Siegel, p. 93-5. This was the first daytime location shoot filmed outside of the United States. The location shoot involved activities never seen in daytime soap operas up to that point, such as snorkeling and horseback riding. They used the steady-cam technique, which was new at the time. The cameraman Nick Udack \\"could walk or jog along side us on the beach,\\" Shoberg said. \\"The steady-cam had a gyroscope that would keep it from bouncing when you took steps\\". The stumbling blocks designed for Erica and Tom's marriage involve the same as her last two since Erica puts her modeling career ahead of starting a family with Tom. They divorce after he discovers that she uses birth control pills. Erica becomes involved with Mike Roy (Nicholas Surovy and then Hugo Napier), the man writing her biography, Raising Kane. \\"He was Erica's first great love,\\" Lucci said. \\"They were very different. He was very intellectual and she was not, and still he loved her for who she was.\\" Mike and Erica fall in love and are kept apart by Adam Chandler (David Canary), the man producing a film adaptation of Raising Kane. Adam sends Mike away to Tibet to separate him and Erica. While Mike is away, Adam offers Erica the lead role in the movie if she marries him. She agrees and they marry in 1984, but Adam casts another actress in the role. After Mike returns, Adam tests Erica's feelings for him by faking his death. She responds to his supposed demise by marrying Mike. Adam reveals he is alive, making their marriage invalid, and forces Erica to choose between him and Mike. She chooses Mike. They plan to marry but before they can he is shot. On his deathbed, he and Erica exchange vows. Erica's next love interest is the Tibetan monk Jeremy Hunter (Jean Leclerc). The Jeremy Hunter character was created as a polar opposite of Erica, in part, because he swore a vow of celibacy which contrasted with her sexuality. He is described as \\"caring, creative, vulnerable, nurturing, patient, and tender.\\" The maternal nature of the character was balanced by his physical and public power.Spence, p. 121. Their relationship was written to reflect a form of protective dominance. Within the storyline, from the summer of 1985 to the summer of 1986 Jeremy rescues her from Adam, his father and Latin American terrorists, all of whom kidnap and attempt to sexually assault Erica. He also saves her from Natalie Marlow, who holds her at gun point.Spence, p. 119. The relationship does not go both ways as they break up when Erica attempts to rescue him. In the story, Jeremy is convicted for a crime he did not commit, so Erica stages a wedding ceremony in prison as a way to break him out by escaping on a helicopter from the roof. Jeremy refuses to let her help him escape, ending their relationship. During the story where Jeremy rescued Erica from Adam, All My Children went on location to Canada to film the scenes. Later, the show again went on location, this time to New York's West Chester County's Wingdale hospital, which provided the setting for Erica's attempt to break Jeremy out of prison. In 1987, Erica becomes involved with the politician Travis Montgomery (Larkin Malloy). Erica and Travis are portrayed as sexually equal and infused with elements of romance and fantasy. Erica becomes pregnant with his child, but does not tell him for fear that it will disrupt his political career. In 1988, when Travis finds out about the baby, they get married. She becomes attracted to his brother, Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey), but does not act on the feeling until after she and Travis divorce. They have \\"a very hot romance\\" and fall in love, but Erica remarries Travis in 1990 at their daughter Bianca's insistence. Travis and Erica's second marriage is not a happy one. \\"I think after they got back together,\\" said Lucci, \\"it was never the same again. There was always this rift. He became bitter and sort of cruel to Erica.\\" Their second marriage ends after Travis catches her cheating on him with Jack. During the custody hearing over Bianca, Jack refuses to lie about their affair, resulting in Erica losing custody of her daughter. In 1991, Adam reveals to Erica that they are still married. He blackmails her into staging another wedding ceremony and living with him as his wife. During this marriage, she meets and falls in love with Dimitri Marick (Michael Nader). She fights her feelings for him while he pursues her despite their marriages to other people. Adam eventually grants Erica a divorce, freeing her to be with Dimitri. Erica and Dimitri carry on a long relationship involving two failed marriages and a miscarriage. The pairing was imbued with fairytale elements that were reflected in the wardrobe designs for Erica's wedding dresses.Warner, p. 131.Warner, p. 303-305. Once Erica and Dimitri separate for a final time in 1997, Erica reunites with Jackson. They become engaged right before Mike Roy is revealed to be alive. Erica is torn between them. Though she chooses Jack, she and Mike engage in sex one last time before he leaves Pine Valley. Jack finds out and breaks things off with her. In 1999, a car accident with David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry) leaves Erica's face disfigured. This storyline unintentionally mirrored a similar car accident Lucci was involved in, in 1966 which almost permanently scarred her face. Like Erica, she needed plastic surgery. In the storyline, Erica and David fall in love while he helps her through her recovery. The obstacles designed to come between them are her continued feelings for Dimitri and his inability to fully give himself to a woman because of what happened to his father when he loved his mother too much. They become engaged to be married but Erica calls it off. She next falls in love with Chris Stamp (Jack Scalia). \\"I really think that she found someone very special in Chris Stamp,\\" Lucci said. \\"They are a pretty hot combination, and he seems strong and capable enough of being with her.\\" In the story, after becoming engaged to Chris, Erica cheats on him with Jack and Chris is killed. She and Jack marry in 2005. They form a family unit including all of their combined children. The union does not last, as they grow apart and Erica cheats on him with Jeff Martin. All My Children hired Mario Van Peebles in 2008 to portray Samuel Woods, Erica's new love interest. The writers based the story on Martha Stewart's insider trading scandal. Erica buys Chandler Enterprises stock based on privileged information Adam Chandler shares with her. U.S. Attorney, Sam Woods brings charges up against her. They develop an attraction while he prosecutes her and she goes to prison for the crime. The relationship goes no further than dating before Sam leaves Pine Valley to campaign for a seat on the Senate. Charles Pratt, Jr. took over as head writer of All My Children in 2008. The next year, he decided to put Erica and Ryan Lavery (Cameron Mathison) together as a couple. News outlets labeled her a \\"cougar\\" since Erica is older than Ryan. Pratt defended the story and said what they have \\"isn't a relationship that's borne out of anything except true respect and a growing affection for each other as Erica becomes Ryan's pillar of support. [He] offers her an escape from what her life has become, which is digging her various daughters out of trouble.\\" He described the couple as \\"a very odd but natural coming together of two people [who are] pushed apart by the attitudes of society.\\" On July 25, 2011, Erica stabs David after she escapes from the clutches of her look-alike Jane Campbell that posed as her. She is taken to Oak Haven and there she first sees Janet \\"from another Planet\\" Green Dillon, then Annie Lavery, then Marian Colby Chandler, and finally she sees Dixie Cooney Martin. On August 11, 2011, Jane takes the blame for stabbing David so Erica can remain free. During the last few episodes of the show Erica is offered a chance to write a movie about her book (much to the dismay of Jack who wants to marry her). This leads to a fallout between the two at Stuart Chandler's welcome home party. As Jack leaves the party, Erica admits in front of everyone that she needs and loves Jack, to which he replies by bitterly telling her, Rhett Butler-style, that \\"frankly,\\" he doesn't give a damn about what she needs. \\"This is not the ending I wanted,\\" Erica says to Opal. \\"Oh, you've done it, now you'll never get it back,\\" Opal tells her. \\"Just watch me,\\" says Erica. As Erica goes after Jack, JR fires his pistol, ending the show. It is implied that the bullet has hit Erica as she is last to be shown before the screen blacks out. In a conversation between Kate Howard and Todd Manning on General Hospital, Erica is mentioned as someone else Todd could have talked to about the job he was offering to Kate, implying she survived the final episode of All My Children. On the June 20, 2013 episode of the Prospect Park version of All My Children, Opal Cortlandt tells Dimitri Marick, one of Erica's ex-husbands that Erica was out of town last seen getting on an airplane to some exotic location without saying when she would be back. In a 2018 episode of General Hospital Maxie Jones is seen on the phone arguing with someone over a bill, and later warns Nina Clay that Erica Kane might be calling her about Maxie's negotiations, suggesting Erica is still alive and working in the fashion industry at this point. Cultural impact The Associated Press reported in 1986 that 60 students at California State University, Fullerton of a group of 100 could recognize Erica Kane but not historical figures such as Alexander Hamilton, Geoffrey Chaucer and Desmond Tutu when asked by English instructor Judith Remy Leder. Susan Lucci hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live on October 6, 1990. In one sketch, Lucci played Kane as a contestant on the fictional game show \\"Game Breakers\\". She seduced fictional game show host Jack Morgan (portrayed by Phil Hartman), thus enabling her to soundly beat her opponent. Morgan came close to marrying Kane (in a ceremony presided over by Don Pardo), but the wedding was interrupted by real-life game show host (and \\"current husband\\") Gene Rayburn. The sketch ended with Kane being mauled by a panther owned by Siegfried and Roy (portrayed by Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey). The Erica Kane character provided inspiration for three songs, all of which were named after her. Alternative rock band Urge Overkill titled a song after the character on their album Saturation. The late R&B; musical artist Aaliyah recorded a song about drug addiction called \\"Erica Kane\\", where the character's name was used as a metaphor for a cocaine. The song was released posthumously on the album I Care 4 U. The band B5 also recorded a song about Erica Kane titled \\"Erika Cain.\\" The song talks about how they're in a relationship with a beautiful girl, but she is crazy. The group contacted All My Children's producers about doing a cameo on the show. They appeared in the April 25, 2008 episode as activists rallying for Erica's release from prison. During the appearance, the group performed \\"Erika Cain.\\" They also taped a video for the song with Susan Lucci. Rapper Lil' Kim at times refers to herself as \\"the black Erica Kane.\\" Mattel created two dolls based on Erica Kane as part of the company's Daytime Drama Collection. They released the first one in 1998. Mattel modeled that doll after the character's appearance during the Crystal Ball, an annual event in All My Children's storylines. After that doll met with success, they released the second in 1999 called the Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane Doll. This one was based on the character as she was during the 1993 wedding to Dimitri Marick. Over the years, Susan Lucci became known for gaining Daytime Emmy Award nominations for her portrayal of Erica, but never winning. Almost every year from 1978 to 1998, Lucci received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series and never won.Siegel, p. 98-112. Her negative reactions to the losses, including pounding her fist on the table and leaving one ceremony in tears, were mentioned in tabloids. Her losses also caused her fellow castmate Ruth Warrick to speak out to the press. In 1983, when Lucci lost to All My Children newcomer Dorothy Lyman (Opal), Warrick said, \\"It seemed impossible that Susan wouldn't win this year. We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled.\\" She later added, \\"It was a slap in the face to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That's not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role.\\" The losing streak became a \\"long-running gag\\" in the entertainment community. Jay Leno on The Tonight Show used it as a joke as did Saturday Night Live. The author of The Emmy, Tom O'Neil, attributed the losses to the material she submitted for consideration. \\"In the episodes she sent in last year, she was crying 75 percent of the time,\\" he said. \\"She drowned her chances in a tsunami of tears. Lucci eventually won the Daytime Emmy Award in 1999, receiving a two-minute standing ovation at the win and again after the show in the press room. A reporter in the press room questioned whether she would miss the attention she got for losing, to which Lucci responded, \\"Oh, not for a minute. Winning is definitely better.\\" The entries Lucci submitted for the 1999 Daytime Emmy Awards involved scenes from Erica's storyline where she helps Bianca deal with her anorexia.

The first Commissioner to actually reside in the Northwest Territories, he was a leader in the construction of a semiautonomous, responsible self-government run by residents of the territory. He was appointed as a citizenship judge in British Columbia in December 1997 and served until 2005. Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the second son of Allan and Mary Hodgson, Hodgson was one of the founders of the Arctic Winter Games - which began in Yellowknife in 1970 for athletes from Alaska, Yukon, and the NWT - and which now also include Greenland, parts of Arctic Russia, as well as Northern Alberta and Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and the new territory Nunavut which was formed from NWT in 1999. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 18, 1970 for his service to labour and government. Subsequently he received the Queen's commemorative medals for her silver, golden, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012); as well as the Canada 125 medal in 1992. When rapid changes in socio-economic conditions threatened the continuity of Inuit oral history, Commissioner Hodgson urged the taping of elders' stories. In 1974, the residents of Pangnirtung (since then becoming part of Nunavut) presented the Commissioner with eleven stories which were later compiled into a book. Hodgson was nicknamed \\"Umingmak\\" by the Inuit. For his services in the NWT, he was presented the public service's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1976. From 1942-45 he served with the Royal Canadian Navy on convoy duty in the North Atlantic for which he received the 1939‚Äì1945 Star, Atlantic Star and other World War II medals. From 1979 to 1981 he was Canadian co-chairman of the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission. He was recruited by Premier William R.

History In 1790, Washington locals began calling the neighborhood \\"Tennally's Town\\" after area tavern owner John Tennally. Over time, the spelling has evolved and by the 19th century the area was commonly known by its current name, although the spelling Tennallytown continued to be used for some time in certain capacities, including streetcars through the 1920s. The area is the site of Fort Reno, one of the forts that formed a ring around Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War to protect the capital against invasions. It proved to be the crucial lookout point for preventing a siege of Washington, because it is the highest natural elevation point in the District of Columbia. 1892 map of rural area around Tenley Fort Reno was decommissioned with the surrender of the Confederate army. The last remains of Fort Reno were removed about 1900, when the land owned by the Dyer family was being prepared for a reservoir. Due to its elevation it is also the site of the oldest home in Washington, D.C. Charles Jones's home called \\"The Rest\\" was believed to be originally built around 1700 and majorly expanded around 1800. This home stayed in the Jones family until 1920 when the Magruder's (local grocers) bought the home. In 1974, the current family owning the home bought the house and still own it today. In the post-Civil War era, Fort Reno was a free black community. This community was almost entirely wiped out when the federal government decided to condemn most of its housing to build Deal Middle School, Wilson High School, a park, and a water tower. The Jesse Lee Reno school building, which housed an African-American school during the Jim Crow era, is one of the few remaining traces of this history. Within the park boundaries lies the highest natural point in the District of Columbia, 409 feet above sea level. Fort Reno also hosts community gardens, free rock concerts in the summer, sledding in the winter, and tennis courts, playing fields, and dog-walkers year round. Wilson HS baseball now uses the ball field for its home games. Tenleytown was transformed on October 2, 1941 when Sears Roebuck opened its department store on Wisconsin Avenue at Albemarle Street. At the time the store was notable for its size and for its 300 car rooftop parking lot. In the 1990s, Sears abandoned its retail operation at the location and the building was used by Hechinger hardware until its demise in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, the building was converted to a mixed-use development complex called Cityline at Tenley, with luxury condominiums (The Cityline) on the top levels, a Best Buy (later closed) and The Container Store at street level, and an Ace Hardware underground, located within the parking garage that serves the aforementioned stores. The west entrance to the Metro station is at the front of the building across from Whole Foods Market. In 2010, the Top of the Town: Tenleytown Heritage Trail opened. The path starts from the Tenleytown-AU metro station and passes by neighborhood landmarks such as American University, Fort Reno Park, and the studios of WRC-TV, Washington's NBC affiliated station. Geographic impact The Cityline Building, home to The Container Store, condominiums, and the west entrance of the Tenleytown-AU Station The neighborhood is home to the highest point in Washington, Fort Reno Park, which houses a baseball field and a soccer field. Due to the high altitude, the neighborhood is home to nearly all of the city's radio masts and towers including the studios and/or towers for WRC-TV, WTTG, WUSA, WETA-TV, WHUT-TV, WDCA, WPXW-TV, WJLA-TV, and radio stations WAMU and WTOP-FM. American Tower started to build an even higher tower, 756 feet (about 230 meters) tall, which could support 169 transmitters, but the District of Columbia government reversed its position, and the incomplete tower was demolished in August 2006. Transportation Tenleytown and adjacent American University Park are served by the Tenleytown-AU stop on the Washington Metro Red Line. A free shuttle bus runs between the Metro stop and American University's main campus. The station is located in the heart of the neighborhood at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Albemarle Street. Metrobus routes 31, 32, 36, 33, 30S, 30N, 37, D32, H2, H3, H4, M4, W45, and W47 serve the neighborhood, all making stops at the station. The neighborhood is defined by Tenley Circle which lies at the intersection of Nebraska Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, and Yuma Street. On Tenley Circle itself is St. Ann's Catholic Church, a large imposing stone church which serves area Catholics. On the opposite side of the circle is Wisconsin Avenue Baptist Church. American University's Washington College of Law, on the site of the former Immaculata School, also bounds the western edge of the circle.

The James Weir Building of the University of Strathclyde is in the background. Rottenrow () is a street in the city of Glasgow in Scotland. It is located at Townhead, in the northern periphery of the city centre, and is located entirely within the John Anderson Campus of the University of Strathclyde. History Rottenrow dates back to the city's medieval beginnings, and once connected the historic High Street to the northern reaches of what is now the Cowcaddens area. The origin of the street's name is subject to debate. Some believe that it is derived from the Gaelic phrase Rat-an-righ, which translates as \\"Road Of The Kings\\" - presumably in relation to its close proximity to Glasgow Cathedral. However \\"Rotten Row\\" is a common street name in towns and villages throughout England and Scotland. It describes a place where there was once a row of tumbledown cottages infested with rats (raton) and goes back to the 14th century or earlier. The street became dissected and realigned by the exponential growth of Glasgow's city centre during the Industrial Revolution, and originally was home to a large amount of tenement housing, much of which had deteriorated into a slum by the middle of the 20th century. Following the Bruce Report in 1945, Townhead was made one of many Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), which saw all of the slums cleared and the area rezoned for educational use in preparation for the former Royal College of Science and Technology‚Äôs growth into a university. Rottenrow is best known however as the address of the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital (usually nicknamed by locals simply as \\"The Rottenrow\\"), founded in 1834, and became a world-renowned centre of excellence in gynaecology for over 100 years. The Maternity Hospital building had become inadequate by the end of the 20th century, and had fallen into a state of serious disrepair. In 2001, the hospital moved into an extension to nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and the building was purchased by the University of Strathclyde and subsequently demolished. The site was redeveloped by the University into a public park designed by Gross Max landscape architects. Known as Rottenrow Gardens, the centrepiece of the park is George Wyllie's 'Monument to Maternity', a sculpture depicting a giant metal nappy pin. The front and side porticos, foundation and basement walls of the Maternity Hospital were preserved, and incorporated into the design of the park. Rottenrow Gardens was officially opened on 25 June 2004 as part of the University's 40th anniversary celebrations by the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Councillor Liz Cameron.Trail 7 Some elements of the park will be permanent, others being temporary in anticipation of future Strathclyde campus expansion and renewal.

Anacostia is a historic neighborhood in Washington, D.C. Its downtown is located at the intersection of Good Hope Road and Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. It is located east of the Anacostia River, after which the neighborhood is named. Like the other quadrants of Washington, D.C., Southeast encompasses many named neighborhoods, of which Anacostia is the most well known. Anacostia includes all of the Anacostia Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Often the name Anacostia is incorrectly used to refer to the entire portion of the city that is southeast of the Anacostia River. The Anacostia Business Improvement District is responsible for the development of the area. History The name \\"Anacostia\\" comes from the anglicized name of a Nacochtank settlement along the Anacostia River. Captain John Smith explored the area in 1608, traveling up the \\"Eastern Branch\\"‚Äîlater the Anacostia River‚Äîmistaking it for the main body of the Potomac River, and met Anacostans. Before the arrival of whites, the Nacostine villages in this area were a lively center of trade visited by Native Americans such as the Iroquois of New York. Even after the founding of Maryland, Leonard Calvert, in a letter to a merchant in London, described \\"Anacostan\\" as one of the three best places in the colony for trading with natives. Around the year 1668, native peoples previously living south of Anacostia were forced northward by war. Anacostine Island, which first appeared on a 1670 map drawn by Augustine Herman, was settled by the Anacostans around this time. 1892 map of Anacostia, DC The core of what is now the Anacostia historic district was incorporated in 1854 as Uniontown and was one of the early suburbs in the District of Columbia. It was designed to be affordable for Washington's working class, many of whom were employed across the river at the Navy Yard; its (then) location outside of and isolated from the city made its real estate inexpensive. The initial subdivision of 1854 carried restrictive covenants prohibiting the sale, rental or lease of property to anyone of African or Irish descent. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, often called \\"the sage of Anacostia\\", bought Cedar Hill, the estate belonging to the developer of Uniontown, in 1877 and lived there until he died in 1895. The home is still maintained as the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site in Anacostia. During the Civil War, Anacostia was protected by a series of forts upon the hills southwest of the city. Following the conclusion of the war, the forts were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Anacostia, always part of the District of Columbia, became a part of the city of Washington when the city and District became coterminous in 1878. On January 27, 1886, the House of Representatives Committee on the District of Columbia voted in favor of renaming Uniontown to Anacostia.\\"Minor District Matters\\". The Washington Post.

Fearing civil unrest, the President ordered the military to disperse the campers from Washington. The Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur dispersed them, but exceeded the orders of President Herbert Hoover by crossing the bridge to Anacostia and torching the veteran's encampment. MacArthur believed that the Bonus Army was composed of and led by Communists. George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower served under MacArthur during these events. Post-war years Anacostia's population remained predominantly European-American up until the late 1950s and early 1960s, with whites comprising 87% of the population. During the 1960s, the Anacostia Freeway (I-295) was constructed. The highway imposed a barrier between the Anacostia neighborhood and the Anacostia River waterfront. Numerous public housing apartment complexes were built in the neighborhood.\\"The Changing Face of Anacostia: Public Housing and Urban Renewal\\", xroads.virginia.edu, no date. Retrieved 2019-02-09. With the flight of much of the middle class out of the neighborhood during the late 1950s and 1960s with the opportunity to move to newer housing in postwar suburbs, Anacostia's demographics changed dramatically as the neighborhood became predominantly African American. Interactions between the area's white and black residents were often contentious, as was the case in the 1949 Anacostia riot at a desegregated public pool. Shopping, dining, and entertainment facilities throughout greater Anacostia are limited, as development slowed with a decrease in income in the area. Residents often must travel to either the suburbs or downtown Washington for these services. Anacostia, however, does have a year-round ice skating rink at Fort Dupont Park; the city police boys' club; and a tennis and learning center, combining sports with academic tutoring in Congress Heights.

It is the most famous neighborhood in the Southeast quadrant of Washington, located east of the Anacostia River, after which the neighborhood is named. Demographics As of the 2000 Census, Anacostia's population is 92% African-American, 5% Non- Hispanic White, and 3% other. Landmarks The Anacostia Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, and it retains much of its mid-to-late 19th-century low-scale, working-class character, as is evident in its architecture. In 1957, an Anacostia landmark, the \\"world's largest chair\\", was installed at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and V Street SE. The chair was installed by the Curtis Brothers Furniture Company and built by Bassett Furniture. In the summer of 2005, the \\"Big Chair\\" was removed for repairs, then returned in April 2006. Industry Notable facilities in the area include Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling (formerly Bolling Air Force Base and Naval Support Facility Anacostia).  Tourism  Founded in 2000, the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative is revitalizing a piece of the Anacostia River waterfront to promote the community. Plans include numerous parks restored of their natural wetlands and forests, canoe tie-ups, a playground, a four-acre 9/11 memorial grove, and an environmental education center. The center provides visitors with education about the history and use of the Anacostia River through a , two-story complex topped by a green roof/nursery center with classrooms, labs, and a multipurpose area beneath. Studios Architecture was chosen to be the architect of the project, while the administrating agency will be the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation.

He is the head groundskeeper at Springfield Elementary School. Willie is almost feral in nature and is immensely proud of his Scottish origin. He is easily identifiable by his red hair and beard, as well as his aggressive temperament and thick, stereotypical Scottish accent. Role in The Simpsons Willie is the janitor at Springfield Elementary School and lives in a shack on the school premises. He is a Scotsman with an aggressive temper. Willie is an uncouth and unpleasant character, though essentially harmless. His personality is depicted as being incompetent, drunken, slow-witted, and quick to anger for little or no reason. Willie has shown antipathy to both his employer, Principal Skinner, and Bart Simpson, who frequently plays practical jokes on him. In Treehouse of Horror VI he plotted revenge on the students of Springfield Elementary after getting burned to death by their parents. Due to the deliberately inaccurate continuity of the series, he has claimed to be from various parts of Scotland during the series, most recently Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands in the 2012 episode 'The Daughter Also Rises'. This settled the previous continuity problem in which Willie had been stated to be a supporter of Aberdeen F.C, and to have lived in Glasgow. In early episodes, Willie's father was said to be dead. However, his parents were later introduced in \\"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\\", and lived near Loch Ness; which is near Inverness. In \\"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\\", it is revealed that he has a cousin, \\"Grave Digger Billy\\". Willie plays a supporting role in most of his episodes, but he was a main character in the episode \\"My Fair Laddy\\", where Lisa Simpson introduced him to high culture as a science project. Willie has a troubled, if distant relationship with his parents. In the episode \\"My Fair Laddy\\", Willie recalls his birth and how his abusive father told him he would never amount to anything in life and would be lucky if he grew up to be \\"garbage\\". On two occasions, Willie frames Bart for pulling pranks that Bart would normally pull. In \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star\\", he unleashes a giant pie of rats on the Springfield Elementary medieval festival to get revenge for being cast as the village idiot and his cruel treatment. Skinner is quick to blame Bart and expels him. Willie is never shown being found out as the culprit, but it can be assumed that he is eventually found out after Bart is enrolled in Catholic school and earns his way back into Springfield Elementary. In \\"Dark Knight Court\\", Willie causes hundreds of eggs to be splattered at the Springfield Easter celebration out of inbred hatred for the holiday. Bart is put on trial for the incident, only to be acquitted when Willie is caught and turned in by Lisa and Mr. Burns (as Fruit Batman). Character Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Groundskeeper Willie Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode \\"Principal Charming\\", first broadcast on February 14, 1991. Originally, the character was written as simply being an angry janitor; his Scottish accent was added during a recording session. Dan Castellaneta, who voices several other characters including Homer Simpson, was assigned to do the voice. Castellaneta did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, told Castellaneta to use an accent. He first tried a Spaniard's voice, which Simon felt was too clich√©d. He then tried a \\"big dumb Swede\\", which was also rejected. For his third attempt, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was considered to be more appropriate and was used in the episode. Originally thought by the directors to be a one-off appearance, Willie has since become a recurring character. Matt Groening later revealed that the character was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas and Jimmy Finlayson, the moustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. A recurring joke, which was first shown in \\"Radio Bart\\", is that Groundskeeper Willie appears to have a beer belly, but whenever he takes off his shirt, he is very muscular. One of Groundskeeper Willie's trademarks is a gruffly-spoken insulting retort, which take the writers a long time to come up with, although they do not consider them that funny.

A spokesman for Aberdeen F.C. disputed Glasgow's claim to the character, citing the episodes \\"Scuse Me While I Miss The Sky\\" and \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\". In Season 23 Episode 13 \\"The Daughter Also Rises\\", first aired in 2012, it was finally stated that Groundskeeper Willie is from Kirkwall in Orkney, therefore ending this dispute. In September 2014, Groundskeeper Willie featured in an official video in which he endorsed a vote for Scottish independence in an upcoming Scottish referendum, and put himself forward to lead a potentially independent Scotland while standing in front of the St. Andrew's Cross with a tattoo on his chest that read: 'Aye or Die!'. Following the result of the referendum where the Scottish electorate voted to remain as part of the UK, the producers released an image of Willie now standing in front of a Union Jack flag, looking depressed with his \\"Aye or Die!\\" tattoo replaced with a picture of the Queen and empty bottles of whisky with a newspaper featuring Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was widely credited with giving the \\"No\\" campaign a last-minute boost. Reception In 2006, Groundskeeper Willie was named the fourth-best peripheral character in the history of the show by IGN, who said \\"high-points for the character were being trained to be civilized, wrestling a wolf that was let loose in the school and becoming a substitute for the French language teacher ‚Äì 'Bon jourrr! You cheese-eating surrender monkeys!'\\" IGN also named \\"My Fair Laddy\\", the only episode which centres around Willie, the best episode of the seventeenth season. Jim Slotek of Sun Media called Willie the ninth-best Simpsons supporting character, and also made a Top Ten quotes list, which included Willie's quote \\"Och, back to the loch wi' ye, Nessie\\", from \\"Selma's Choice\\". The Times reported in late-2005 that \\"he is the most instantly recognisable Scot in the world: better known than Billy Connolly or Ewan McGregor, even Sean Connery.\\" The same article quotes Simpsons creator Matt Groening as saying \\"We wanted to create a school janitor that was filled with rage, sort of our tribute to angry janitors all over the world\\".

Early life Nader was born on February 19, 1945, in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents split up a few months after his birth. Nader accompanied his mother, Minette, when she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an entertainment career. He graduated from Palisades Charter High School in 1963. At 16, Nader was one of three young surfers featured in a September 1961 Life photo spread accompanying the article \\"The Mad, Happy Surfers: A Way of Life on the Wavetops\\". Career Nader began his acting career in 1963 with small roles in several of American International Pictures Beach Party films, then billed as \\"Mike Nader\\". He later appeared in the recurring role of Siddo in the 1965‚Äì66 TV series Gidget, and had a small role in the 1968 film Blue. Nader's first soap opera role was playing Kevin Thompson on As the World Turns from 1975 to 1978. In 1983, he appeared in the NBC prime time soap opera Bare Essence as Alexi Theopolis. Nader won the role of Farnsworth \\"Dex\\" Dexter, the eventual third husband of Alexis Colby (Joan Collins), on the prime time soap opera Dynasty in 1983. He remained on the series until its cancellation in 1989. Nader appeared as Nazi officer Burchhardt in the 1988 television film The Great Escape II: The Untold Story. The same year, he co-starred as Nick Scalfone in the TV movie Lady Mobster. In 1990, he appeared as Enzio Bonnatti in the miniseries Lucky Chances. Nader returned to soap operas in 1991, portraying Dimitri Marick, the husband of Erica Kane (Nader's Lady Mobster costar Susan Lucci), on the daytime drama All My Children. He played the role from 1991 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2001. Nader returned for All My Children online revival in 2013. Nader has appeared in episodes of other TV series, including The Flash (1991), Law And Order: SVU (2002), and Cold Case (2009). Personal life Nader was hit by a drunk driver at age six, which left him with a visible facial scar. He dated actress Ellen Barber for 10 years, with the relationship ending around the same time as his role on As the World Turns. Nader married Robin Weiss in June 1984, and a month later they had a daughter. He has been married to Beth Windsor since 1992. In 1984, Nader admitted to previously having a drug problem, which prompted him to become sober in 1980. He was charged with drunk driving in 1997, and in 2001 was arrested for attempting to sell cocaine to an undercover police officer. Nader was let go from his role on All My Children soon after, with a statement from ABC that if he resolved his issues they would rehire him. They never did, and Nader sued the network, alleging that they never intended to bring him back to the show at all. He is the nephew of actor George Nader.

The role has been most notably portrayed by Michael Nader, previously famed for his role on Dynasty. Former head writers Agnes Nixon and Lorraine Broderick created the character in 1991, designing him as a brooding and mysterious character based on heroes from gothic literature, such as Maxim de Winter from Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca and Heathcliff from Emily Bront√´'s novel Wuthering Heights. The character's introduction raised All My Children in the Nielsen ratings and was credited as the \\"saving grace\\" of the unpopular Natalie and Janet storyline. Soon after his debut on the soap opera, Dimitri became a complex leading man and took part in some of the most notable plots of the 1990s. Those storylines included popular romances with Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) and Alexandra Devane (Finola Hughes), as well as a loving yet antagonistic fraternal relationship with Edmund Grey (John Callahan). In July 1999, Nader was let go from All My Children due to budgetary considerations, however, he later returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character to the center of a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets.Entertainment Tonight airdate 25 June 2001 As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back due to a lack of storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013. Casting Casting the role of Dimitri gave All My Children difficulty. The series' casting director, Judy Blye Wilson, tested between fifteen and twenty actors, and could not find the right actor for the job. Wilson then learned that the former Dynasty star, Michael Nader was available and suggested the show offer him the part. Before All My Children offered him the role of Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York. \\"My fiancee, Beth Windsor, had literally just worked into being bicoastal,\\" he said. \\"She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York and would have been spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity.\\" Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. \\"The fact of the matter is we're in a different era,\\" he said. \\"And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time.\\" Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York. Since finding the right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the character for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children working overtime to catch up. \\"By the time we had resolved some of the terms,\\" he said, \\"they were really against the wall in terms of back story.... In retrospect, I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!\\" Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, \\"They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri and it was like doing scenes inside a sauna.\\" This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks. Michael Nader was fired from All My Children in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off. This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor's return. To partially appease them, the show's executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis. He rejected this offer because \\"after being a major character for so long, it didn't make any sense to me. So I declined. But if the network was interested in seriously discussing Dimitri's return on a contract basis I would love to go back.\\" In May 2000, he was rehired and brought back into the role with a multi-year contract. The return story scripted for the Dimitri character centered on the romance between his brother Edmund and his wife Alex. Dimitri was revealed to be alive just as his wife, Alex, and brother, Edmund, had sex for the first time. Nader said he wanted to create a deeper layer in the character instead of focusing solely on the love triangle between Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund. \\"I do hope to pursue some sort of subtle spiritual change, some perception that Dimitri is different,\\" he said. He questioned the writers' storyline choice in not exploring the popular Dimitri and Erica romance again. \\"I found it sort of odd that they'd move me so far away from Susan[Lucci, Erica],\\" Nader said. \\"They're trying to explore these other themes.\\" Nader lost the role again in February 2001 as a result of the actor getting arrested for allegedly selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. All My Children released an official statement saying, \\"If Mr. Nader gets the help that he needs and addresses his problem, and it makes sense for the show, we would be prepared to speak with Michael in the future.\\" The network put Nader on probation and ordered him to seek help for his problem. Anthony Addabbo temporarily took over the role, first airing on April 6, 2001. To prepare for the role, he watched tapes of Nader's portrayal of Dimitri in order to see the relationships between Dimitri and other characters. Despite the fan protest against the role being recast, Addabbo told Soap Opera Digest he was not worried. \\"I don't find it intimidating,\\" he said. \\"I know how they can come to love a certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything, but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn't find it intimidating at all.\\" Soap Opera Digest considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed \\"all-American good guys\\" such as Generations Jason Craig and Guiding Light's Jim LeMay. A large number of All My Children fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader's return. The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri's role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go \\"for storyline reasons\\", according to ABC's official statement. During an interview, Nader told Soap Opera Digest that in late September 2001, ABC called a meeting with him to inform him that, though he resolved his personal problems, they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back due to lack of story. Nader argued that other storyline possibilities existed since he and Dimitri received \\"a tremendous response\\" from viewers. \\"For years, Dimitri and Erica were a popular coupling,\\" he said. \\"A good friend of mine, Jack Scalia (Chris), is on...that alone would be a dynamic triangle.\\" In May 2013, following a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role of Dimitri, scheduled to begin in June. Initially his first airdate was 3 June, however, due to Prospect Park's decision to reduce the number of episodes made available each week, he did not air until 12 June. Development Former head writers Agnes Nixon and Lorraine Broderick created the character Dimitri Marick in 1991. His original purpose was to rescue Natalie Marlowe from the well her sister, Janet Green, trapped her in. He was also designed as a rival for Natalie's current love interest, Trevor Dillon. Trevor and Natalie were a popular couple at that point and the writers wanted to create a viable obstacle for them. eally exciting, romantic, handsome leading man, so that there would be a real impediment; you know we'd have a really exciting love story between Trevor and somebody as different from Trevor as we could get...because Trevor is a wonderful, warm, teddy bear, lovable, down-to-earth, right-out-there guy- and Dimitri is very much opposite from that.\\" Broderick characterized the character in an interview with Soap Opera Update, stating: Nixon and Broderick also crafted the character as a darkly brooding and mysterious man in the same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told Soap Opera Weekly, \\"In doing the 'stolen life' story, I felt that we needed something to follow that was also a little larger than life, very romantic, and gothic.\\" The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind.Daphne Du Maurier, Rebecca, . The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.Charlotte Bront√´, Jane Eyre, . Nixon infused elements of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. \\"There's a gothic quality to it\\", she said, referring to the couple. \\"It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry.\\" Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly stayed away from the press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character in such a way as to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, \\"John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull\\", he said. \\"Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet.\\" Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. \\"The more we see of him, the more he inspires us\\", Broderick said. \\"It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character[...] He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write.\\" Storylines Backstory To further the mystery element and add an international twist to the story, Nixon scripted Dimitri as having close European roots, though he is an American. He is the son of Hungarian parents, Hugo and Anna. Originally, his wealth comes from all the land around Pine Valley and the One Life to Live city Llanview, which he inherits from his parents. That is also where his fictional estate, Wildwind, is located. Later, during Dimitri's 1992 story with Erica Kane, he is revealed to also be Hungarian nobility as Count Andrassy. He inherited his title and his Hungarian castle, Vadzel, from his father's side.Gary Warner, All My Children: The Complete Family Scrapbook, p. 116-117, . Both of his parents were dead by the time Dimitri first appears on All My Children. He spends his childhood years growing up in Europe and on the Wildwind estate. He has a complicated relationship with Edmund Gresham, the son of two of his family's employees, unknown to Dimitri to be his half-brother. His childhood sweetheart was Angelique Voynitzeva, the daughter of his nanny, Helga. Helga later becomes his housekeeper. Fifteen years prior to Dimitri's appearance on-screen, he and Angelique married. Angelique becomes pregnant but suffers a miscarriage which devastates both of them. Angelique has a riding accident which leaves her in a coma. Dimitri tries to find a cure, but is unable to and sends her to a clinic in Austria. He becomes reclusive for the next decade because of the guilt he feels over her condition. Finding Natalie in 1991 brings him out into society again.Warner, p. 115. 1991‚Äì2001 Dimitri Marick first appears in Pine Valley in 1991 when he rescues Natalie Marlowe from the well her twin sister, Janet Green, trapped her in on the Wildwind estate. She resembles his wife, Angelique, which attracts him to her. While he nurses her back to health, Dimitri becomes obsessively in love with her. His housekeeper, Helga, warns him not to get involved with her because of his marriage to her comatose daughter, Angelique. He lies to Natalie that his wife died years ago. Once Natalie recovers and everyone learns what happened to her at Janet's hand, Natalie's fianc√©, Trevor Dillon, tries to reconcile with her. She rejects him because Janet fooled him so easily. Dimitri and Natalie become engaged. Unbeknown to Dimitri, Angelique awakens from her coma. Helga reveals Angelique is out of her coma by bringing her to Wildwind during Dimitri and Natalie's engagement party. Natalie leaves Dimitri and reunites with Trevor. Dimitri reconciles with his wife. In 1992, Dimitri begins an affair with Erica Kane. He falls in love with her, but feels he must stay with Angelique. He eventually leaves her for Erica. Dimitri and Erica's storylines include a tumultuous romance leading to two failed marriages and a miscarriage. One of the biggest obstacles in their relationship is Erica's vindinctive and manipulative daughter, Kendall Hart. In that same year, Edmund Grey, the son of a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his childhood friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will in order to keep the estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry. Another bombshell is dropped in Dimitri's life when he finds out that Anton Lang, who he believed to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of.Warner, p. 118-119. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town. During a time when they are both particularly vulnerable, Dimitri and Edmund's wife, Maria, sleep together. When Maria finds out she is pregnant, they have a DNA test done. Skye Chandler, who is in love with Edmund, tampers with test so it will show Dimitri is the father when it is in fact Edmund. After Maria confesses everything, a devastated Edmund tells Dimitri that he is dead to him and he will be bringing the child up as his own. Maria gives birth to a baby girl named Maddie and is later presumed dead in a plane crash. Dimitri discovers that Edmund is Maddie's father when he finds out their blood types do not match. He takes her to Vadzel, but Edmund tracks them down and takes back custody of Maddie. The brothers remain estranged for quite some time, but eventually manage to reconcile. Dimitri leaves Pine Valley permanently in 2001 with his current wife, Alex Devane. 2013 In June 2013, Dimitri received an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke was shocked when Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, and told him that she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with his family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier. Brooke explained to Dimitri that she needed someone to oversee the online division of Chandler Media, and she felt Dimitri would be perfect for the job. Dimitri eagerly accepted. Later, Brooke re-introduced Dimitri to J.R. Chandler, who, although appeared happy to see Dimitri, was nonetheless jealous of the fact that Dimitri, and not him, would be overseeing Chandler Media. As Dimitri and Brooke worked more and more closely together, Dimitri developed feelings for her, which came to a head when he kissed her shortly after the Chandler Media Gala. Brooke told Dimitri that can never happen again, because she is engaged to marry Adam. Post Cancellation During a March 2019 episode of General Hospital the character Robert Scorpio tells Anna Devane that he has been in touch with Dimitri related to an investigation into ex-wife Alex's activities, and that Dimitri has handed over records relating to Alex for Anna to review. Reception Dimitri became a popular leading man soon after his debut on All My Children in 1991 and \\"was prominent in some of the show's most memorable tales of that decade.\\" The character and his portrayer, Michael Nader, were credited with lifting the Nielsen ratings as well as saving the Natalie, Trevor, and Janet storyline. In that storyline, the character Janet Green imprisons her sister Natalie in a well and masquerades as Natalie to seduce her fianc√© Trevor. Fans and soap opera press criticized the story. In Soap Opera Weekly, Marlena De Lacroix said, \\"Dimitri was the saving grace of the storyline I'd earlier called an artistic disaster: the Janet and Natalie body switch.\\" She described Dimitri as a \\"cross between Rudolph Valentino's Sheik and the gothic Maxim de Winter from Rebecca.\\" Viewers found the character \\"irresistible\\"; so much so that Soap Opera Digest questioned whether the character was a diversion from the failed storyline. All My Children's head writer Agnes Nixon denied this. \\"We expected to get negative mail on Janet/Nat,\\" she said, \\"they [the viewers] don't like it but they [keep] watching.\\" The character gained further success with the popular Dimitri and Erica pairing. In 1993, viewers named them a supercouple, along with One Life to Live's Bo and Nora and Days of our Lives' Roman and Marlena. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly listed them among the top seventeen supercouples. Soap Opera Digest compared them to the real life couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton because of their tumultuous nature. The romance between Dimitri and Finola Hughes' Alexandra Devane Marick also rose in popularity. Soap Opera Update named them the best couple of the year in 1999 for All My Children despite the fact that their love story played out through brief flashbacks. The magazine compared the couple's relationship to the television series Once and Again. Soap Opera Update also referred to them as the \\"break out supercouple of the year\\". The Dimitri character took a darker turn in 1997, in what Soap Opera Digest considered an effort to make Erica more sympathetic after her role in the kidnapping of the baby Maddie Grey (then known as Sonya). Soap Opera Digest praised the move in an article naming Nader Performer of the Week, saying, \\"Nader has been surprisingly effective as a meanie, and nothing short of brilliant taking an already complex character and making him more compelling.\\" Soap Opera Weekly's Gabrielle Winkel expressed similar sentiments, saying, \\"Michael Nader is far more entertaining and compelling now that Dimitri is out for himself than when he was as Erica's devoted husband...AMC was right on target when it developed Dimitri's dark side. Nader's brooding looks and raspy voice have always given Dimitri that evil edge. Nader, though, wisely keeps Dimitri's obsessiveness sufficiently in check to make it believable.\\" At the conclusion of the storyline Soap Opera Digest again named him Performer of the Week for \\"unleashing the sort of go- for-broke fury and fray that actors are usually reluctant to release unless they're certain their character is about to be killed off.\\" Soap Opera Digest noted the rarity of brothers like Edmund Grey and Dimitri Marick. In the soap opera genre, brothers with a standing rivalry as well as a strong fraternal bond are considered to be a rarity. Sisters on soap operas were usually the ones who shared \\"men, makeup, and misery.\\" Dimitri and Edmund's relationship was scripted as complicated, transitioning between loving and antagonistic. Their relationship gained positive feedback from both viewers and the soap opera media. Soap Opera Digest named them Best Brothers of 1994, saying, \\"In Michael Nader (Dimitri) and John Callahan (Edmund), AMC has charismatic performers with chemistry, and they're making the most of it.\\" Complications in the brothers' relationship included childhood jealousies, the revelation that they were brothers, Dimitri's one-night stand with Edmund's wife Maria and subsequent question of the paternity of Maddie Grey, and the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle. Along with the conflict, they displayed a loving relationship where they stood by each other. In describing the relationship, Nader said, \\"The storyline with Edmund and Dimitri, the Marick brothers, there wasn't a brother duo on television that had the sort of power that John and I could bring to that relationship.\\" Storylines they featured in met with both praise and negative reactions. With the plot centering on Maddie Grey's paternity and kidnappings, All My Children \\"fans revolted en masse.\\" Yet Soap Opera Digest hailed the plot as \\"one of the best told, most fascinating storylines of the year.\\" In the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle, viewers took two opposing views on which brother should end up with Alex. Soap Opera Weekly proclaimed the triangle a hit, while Soap Opera Update rated it a ten out of ten. In the storyline, Alex and Edmund fall in love while her husband Dimitri is presumed dead. They eventually become engaged. When he returns and witnesses their happy relationship, Dimitri decides not to interfere. \\"The dilemma for Dimitri is his brother's happiness,\\" Nader said. \\"As much as he loves Alex, he's made the choice to give her to Edmund.\\" Alex discovers Dimitri alive first. They reunite and engage in sex. Edmund finds out and feels betrayed by them both. The scenes of the confrontation between all three characters was written to express the views of both the Dimitri and Alex and the Edmund and Alex fans. The viewers who rooted for Edmund argued that Dimitri and Alex betrayed him by having sex immediately after reuniting. Viewers who supported Dimitri argued that the reunion was not a betrayal since Dimitri was Alex's husband. Alex ends up with Dimitri, which changes \\"Edmund from a jaded, one-note character into a far more multidimensional and intriguing hero.\\" Soap Opera Weekly praised All My Children for not dragging the triangle out and instead using it as a catalyst for character development. Controversy In what Soap Opera Digest named the year's Dumbest Male Axing in 1999, Nader was fired from the role of Dimitri and the character was killed off. The firing \\"set off a firestorm of protest from devoted fans.\\" Those fans came together to form a group called the Loyalists and campaigned for the actor's return. They \\"bombarded\\" All My Children with letters centering on three major complaints concerning Nader's dismissal, as summarized in Soap Opera Digest: \\"1) They have waited two years for a Dimitri/Erica reunion, which they won't get now that he's leaving. 2) They adore Nader's chemistry with on-screen brother John Callahan (Edmund) and don't want to lose it. 3) They fear that Nader has been sacrificed to make room in the budget for new- and younger- cast members.\\" In response to the last complaint, an All My Children spokesperson pointed out the storylines planned for characters over thirty years old such as Tad, Dixie, Erica, David, Edmund, and Alex. Nader thanked the Loyalists for their support and expressed his surprise at the size of the response. \\"[T]he expanse and impact were quite astounding to me,\\" he said. \\"In my years of doing this, I never experienced this kind of support.\\" Susan Lucci commented on the fan response, saying, \\"So many people stop me on the street and ask me, 'Will Dimitri ever come back and will he and Erica ever get together.'\\" At a fan luncheon, the Loyalists confronted All My Children's executive producer Jean Dadario Burke with a petition asking for Nader's return. They also organized a tune-out of the show on November 5, 1999. To appease them at least in part, Burke offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis, which he refused. In 2000, All My Children rehired him on a contract basis. His co-star, Hughes was happy about the news, saying his return would \\"give a huge injection of 'fuel'\\" to the Alex and Edmund romance. In 2001, Nader was arrested for cocaine possession. All My Children suspended him and demanded he get treatment. They cast Addabbo in the role as a temporary replacement. Fans of Nader, the Loyalists in particular, rejected the recast. Though the majority of the viewers did not take to him, Addabbo gained an amount of support from fans who wanted him to continue in the role or portray a different character once Nader returned. Soap Opera Digest criticized the casting of Addabbo because the actor usually portrayed \\"all-American good guys\\", the opposite of the Dimitri Marick role. In July of that year, Addabbo was let go and Dimitri was officially written out. After Nader got help for his drug addiction at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota, All My Children opted not to bring him back. Nader filed a $31.7 million lawsuit against ABC for breach of contract under the Americans with Disabilities Act. ABC's lawyers cited Nader's violation of the morals clause in his contract as justification for not rehiring him. The firing and lawsuit caught the attention of non-soap opera medias such as TV Guide, Inside Edition, People, Celebrity Justice, Extra, Entertainment Tonight, and Larry King Live.Inside Edition airdate 2 November 2001Celebrity Justice airdate 10 September 2002Extra airdate 28 June 2001 Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S.

The shops sell, in addition to books, comic books, graphic novels, manga, DVDs, video games, and a wide variety of toys, clothing and other collectible merchandise. History Founding The Forbidden Planet in Manhattan, New York, at 832 Broadway Interior of the Manhattan store's current location on opening day, 24 July 2012 Forbidden Planet London is the name of the cult entertainment Megastore in London, UK, flagship of a national chain that includes Megastores in Bristol and Southampton, other stores throughout the midlands and the south of England, and an online presence. Specialising in movie and television merchandise, the stores retail art toys, comics, collectibles, DVDs, and graphic novels. They also host signings and events with authors, artists and other figures from cult media. Forbidden Planet London was the third major comics store in the city, eventually replacing what had been the leading shop, Derek Stokes's Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, which had started in 1969, and coming after Frank and Joan Dobson's Weird Fantasy in New Cross. Much of FP's growth came after the demise of Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, which went out of business in 1981. Forbidden Planet had grown out of the Titan Distributors business of Mike Lake, Nick Landau, and Mike Luckman; Titan itself having grown out of Comic Media Distributors. The first Forbidden Planet began life in 1978 as a small store in Denmark Street. As the scope of the store expanded beyond comics to embrace film and television, a second store was opened just around the corner on St Giles High Street. The store's success led to overcrowding, necessitating a move to much larger premises on New Oxford Street. The original partners, in addition to improving their London store, paired with James Hamilton and Kenny Penman (today the main shareholders in Forbidden Planet International with Andrew Oddie, Richard Boxall and Colin Campbell) to open other stores. Penman and Hamilton were owners of one of the UK's oldest comics and SF stores, Science Fiction Bookshop, in Edinburgh, which opened around 1975. On 30 September 2003, the London store moved to even bigger premises at the northern end of Shaftesbury Avenue. Forbidden Planet opened a second Megastore in Clifton Heights in Bristol in 2005, and a third in Southampton in 2007. In 2006 the company launched forbiddenplanet.com, an e-commerce retail site offering a wide range of products and hosting details of the company's many events and signings. Expansion The original chain split into two firms, called Forbidden Planet and Forbidden Planet Scotland (later renamed Forbidden Planet International). Forbidden Planet International grew beyond Scotland to include stores throughout the Midlands, in Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland and majority ownership of two stores in New York City. The first New York store was originally located at 56 East 12th Street and Broadway in Greenwich Village, opening in the early 1980s. There they had one of the most extensive selections in the world of in-print science fiction and fantasy paperbacks, primarily from major genre labels such as Ballantine, Del Rey, Ace, and so on, but also some small press materials. There were also large and small press magazines, some hardbacks, tie-in toys and merchandise, and comics. They occasionally had book signing appearances by famous authors such as Douglas Adams. The location across the street from the Strand Bookstore and less than a mile from Baird Searles' The Science Fiction Shop made the area a mecca for genre fans. An additional New York store opened in the mid-eighties at 227 East 59th Street in Lenox Hill, with a smaller selection. Rising rent led to its closure in the '90s. In the 1990s, the primary New York store moved across the street to a significantly smaller space at 840 Broadway and East 13th Street, and the focus became comic books and graphic novels, with a greatly diminished selection of traditional fiction. It operated there until 22 July 2012. On 24 July 2012 the New York store reopened several doors south at 832 Broadway, where it would enjoy 3,400 square feet of retail space.Johnston, Rich.

FPI also runs a blog featuring comics and SF related news, reviews and interviews with novelists and comics creators and has recently begun podcasting too. As well as the main webstore with a wide range of comics, SF and cult merchandise and graphic novels (including a number of British small press titles) there are also sites dedicated to new comics and back issues. In total, between the two groups who trade under the same name, there are currently some 30 stores worldwide.

She is best known for her role of Judy Winslow, the youngest daughter of Carl and Harriette Winslow on the ABC/CBS sitcom Family Matters. Career Foxworth began modeling at the age of five, soon appeared in national television advertisements, and ultimately landed the role of Judy Winslow, the youngest of the Winslow family's three children, on the long-running sitcom Family Matters. Family Matters After the introduction of Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), Foxworth's scenes were reduced significantly. The combination of the character having little to do on the show and budget cuts caused producers to eliminate her off the series after its fourth season. The character disappeared without explanation, with the Winslows acknowledging only two children: Eddie (Darius McCrary) and Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams). Later career With very little acting work coming in the years after Family Matters, Foxworth formed a R&B; musical group, S.H.E., with her two sisters (Tyren Perry, Jania Perry). They then released their debut album 3's a Charm on July 1, 1997 through Shaquille O'Neal's T.W.IsM./Interscope Records. From 2000-2002, She worked in the adult industry, making pornographic films under the pseudonym Crave.  Personal life  Foxworth battled substance abuse and depression. It was rumored that this was prompted in part by a judge's ruling that her trust fund of more than $500,000 be used to save her family from bankruptcy, but she denied this in a 2009 interview, stating, \\"I think [that came] from the National Enquirer. We never filed for bankruptcy. We were almost to the point where we were just completely flat broke but we never filed for bankruptcy.\\" In December 2008, People magazine reported that Foxworth was pregnant. She and longtime boyfriend Michael Shaw were expecting a child in early 2009. On May 29, 2009, People reported that Foxworth and Shaw's baby was born, a boy named Michael Douglas Shaw, Jr. He was 10 days overdue, and Foxworth shared the news of his birth while still in the delivery room via text message. In Fall 2009, the TV One series Life After chronicled Foxworth's story, dealing with her departure from Family Matters, and her subsequent marijuana use, which she claimed to have stopped smoking.

This provoked Thomas Sprat (then spokesman for and historian of the Society) to publish Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier's Voyage into England (London: 1665) as a reply to Sorbi√®re's perceived insults against both English culture and the Society in particular. In order to avoid further international controversy, Sorbi√®re was held under arrest for four months in France, and Charles II of England prohibited any further responses. Sorbi√®re's conversion from Calvinism to Catholicism, which opened a career to him, has been interpreted in a political light.For instance, by Francisque Bouillier, Histoire de la philosophie cart√©sienne, 3rd ed. 1868. vol.

She interpreted contemporary avant-garde music composed, among others, by Luciano Berio, Bruno Maderna, John Cage, Henri Pousseur, Sylvano Bussotti, Darius Milhaud, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, and Igor Stravinsky. She also interpreted works by Claudio Monteverdi, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Kurt Weill, Philipp Zu Eulenburg, arrangements of songs by The Beatles, and folk songs from several countries and cultures. As a composer, she wrote Stripsody (1966), in which she exploits her vocal technique using comic book sounds (onomatopoeia), and Morsicat(h)y (1969), a composition for the keyboard (with the right hand only) based on Morse code. Biography Cathy Berberian was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts to Armenian parents, Yervant and Louise Berberian. The elder of two children, she spent the first 12 years of her life in Attleboro, then the family moved to New York City in 1937 where she graduated from Manhattan's Julia Richman High School for Girls. From an early age, she showed an interest in Armenian folk music and dance as well as traditional opera. While still in high school, she was the director and soloist of the Armenian Folk Group in New York City. For a time, she was an undergraduate at New York University, but left to take evening classes in theatre and music at Columbia University, working during the day to support her studies. She went on to study music in Paris with Marya Freund in 1948, and in 1949 she went to Milan to study singing at the Milan Conservatory with Giorgina del Vigo. In 1950, she received a Fulbright scholarship to continue her studies there. Although she had appeared in several student productions, radio broadcasts and informal concerts during the early 1950s, she made her formal debut in 1957 at Incontri Musicali, a contemporary music festival in Naples. The following year her performance of John Cage's Aria with Fontana Mix in its world premiere, established her as a major exponent of contemporary vocal music.Randel, Don Michael (1996) The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, Harvard University Press. . p. 67 Her American debut came in 1960 at the Tanglewood Music Festival where she premiered Circles by the Italian composer Luciano Berio. From 1950 to 1964 Berberian was married to Luciano Berio, whom she met when they were students at the Milan Conservatory. They had one daughter, Cristina Berio, born in 1953. Berberian became Berio's muse and collaborator both during and after their marriage. He wrote, for her, Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) (1958), Circles (1960), Visage (1961), Folk Songs (1964‚Äì73), Sequenza III (1965), and Recital I (for Cathy) (1972). In 1967 Berberian took an artistic detour, releasing a 12-track album (recorded in Paris) that consisted entirely of quirky baroque-style cover versions of songs by The Beatles, entitled Beatles Arias. The instrumental backing was scored for a classical string quartet or wind quintet plus harpsichord or organ. Most of the tracks were arranged by Guy Boyer, and most of the songs featured him on harpsichord. The original cover illustration for the album was by Gerald Scarfe. The album was reissued on CD in 2005 with bonus tracks including a 1975 French radio interview, and three live tracks featuring Berberian performing songs from the album, recorded at French music festivals in the early 1980s, with accompaniment by Italian composer‚Äìmusician Bruno Canino and arrangements by noted Dutch composer Louis Andriessen. Sylvano Bussotti, John Cage, Hans Werner Henze, William Walton, Igor Stravinsky, and Anthony BurgessPhillips, Paul (2010) A Clockwork Counterpoint. Manchester University Press. . p. 65 also composed works for her voice. Although Berberian was based in Milan from the time of her studies there, she taught at both Vancouver University and the Rheinische Musikschule in Cologne during the 1970s. Following her death, Berio composed Requies: in memoriam Cathy Berberian which premiered in Lausanne on March 26, 1984. She is mentioned in the Steely Dan song \\"Your Gold Teeth\\" from the 1973 album Countdown to Ecstasy : : \\"Even Cathy Berberian knows / There's one roulade she can't sing.\\" Berberian was also a translator. With Umberto Eco she translated into Italian works by Jules Feiffer and, with other Italian translators, works by Woody Allen. Eco and Berberian worked together in other projects too and he nicknamed her magnificathy. This nickname with a different spelling chosen by Berberian herself: magnifiCathy was later used as the title of one of her most well known albums. Death Berberian died from a heart attack. Berberian had been scheduled to appear on March 7, 1983 in a broadcast for RAI Italian Television in Rome. She planned to perform the Italian version of The Internationale, the anthem of international socialism. On March 6, she left her apartment in Milan with Luigi Manca who had helped her for many years in her daily routine and who was also her second husband. Arriving at Rome airport, the couple went straight to a restaurant owned by a friend of Berberian. Afterwards, in a taxi that was taking them to the Hotel Mondial, Berberian became unwell. As soon as they reached their hotel rooms a doctor was summoned, but she died before he arrived. Her body was cremated in Rome and the urn with her ashes was brought to Milan where, on March 13, a ceremony was held in the Armenian Church of Via Jommelli. The ashes were divided between Berberian's brother Ervant and her daughter Cristina, who later dispersed them in the Mediterranean Sea, in front of the city of Oneglia, along with pink orchids, Berberian's favorite flower.

The programme was named after Ernest Bevin, a former trade union official and then British Labour Party politician who was Minister of Labour and National Service in the wartime coalition government. Chosen by lot as ten percent of all male conscripts aged 18‚Äì25, plus some volunteering as an alternative to military conscription, nearly 48,000 Bevin Boys performed vital and dangerous civil conscription service in coal mines. Although the last ballot took place in May 1945 (shortly before VE Day), the final conscripts were not released from service until March 1948. Few chose to remain working in the country's coal mining industry after demobilisation; most left for further education or for employment in other sectors. During their time at the mines, Bevin Boys were targets of abuse from the general public, who mistakenly believed them to be draft dodgers or cowards and they were frequently stopped by the police as possible deserters. Unlike those who had served in the military, Bevin Boys were not awarded medals for their contribution to the war effort and official recognition by the British government was only conferred in 1995. Creation of programme Shortfall in UK coal output UK coal output for the years 1913 to 1950. The periods of the two World Wars are highlighted in grey. At the start of World War II, the UK was highly dependent on coal, not only to power ships and trains, but as the main source of energy for electricity generation. Although output from mines had increased as the world economy recovered from the Great Depression, it was in decline again by the time war broke out in September 1939. At the beginning of the war the Government, underestimating the value of strong younger coal miners, conscripted them into the armed forces. By mid-1943 the coal mines had lost 36,000 workers, and they were generally not replaced, because other likely young men were also being conscripted to the armed forces. Industrial relations were also poor: In the first half of 1942, there were several local strikes over wages in the first half of 1942 across the country, which also reduced output. In response, the government increased the minimum weekly pay to 83 shillings (for those over the age of 21 working underground) and established a new Ministry of Fuel, Light and Power, under the leadership of Gwilym Lloyd George to oversee the reorganisation of coal production for the war effort. In late summer, a bonus scheme was proposed to reward workers in mines that exceeded their output targets. These measures resulted in an increase in production in the second half of 1942, although volumes were still short of the tonnage required. Absenteeism (miners taking time off work as a result of e.g. sickness) also rose through the war from 9.65% in December 1941 to 10.79% and 14.40% in the Decembers of 1942 and 1943 respectively. By October 1943, Britain was becoming desperate for a continued supply of coal, both for the industrial war effort and for keeping homes warm throughout the winter. Appeals for volunteers Ernest Bevin (photographed in 1942) On 23 June 1941, Bevin made a broadcast appeal to former miners, asking them to volunteer to return to the pits, with an aim of increasing numbers of mineworkers by 50,000. He also issued a 'standstill' order, to prevent more miners being called up to serve in the armed forces. On 12 November 1943, Bevin made a radio broadcast aimed at sixth-form boys, to encourage them to volunteer to work in the mines when they registered for National Service. He promised the students that, like those serving in the armed forces, they would be eligible for the government‚Äôs further education scheme. :We need 720,000 men continuously employed in this industry‚Ä¶ This is where you boys come in. Each one of you, I am sure, is full of enthusiasm to win this war. You are looking forward to the day when you can play your part with your friends and brothers who are in the Navy, the Army, the Air Force‚Ä¶ But believe me, our fighting men will not be able to achieve their purpose unless we get an adequate supply of coal‚Ä¶ So when you go to register and the question is put to you \\"Will you go into the mines?‚Äù let your answer be, \\"Yes, I will go anywhere to help win this war\\". :Ernest Bevin, 12 November 1943 The term Bevin Boys is thought to originate from this broadcast. Conscription On 12 October 1943 Gwilym Lloyd George, Minister of Fuel and Power, announced in the House of Commons that some conscripts would be directed to the mines. On 2 December Ernest Bevin explained the scheme in more detail in parliament, announcing his intention to draft 30,000 men aged 18 to 25 by 30 April 1944. From 1943 to 1945 one in ten of young men called up was sent to work in the mines. This caused a deal of upset, as many young men wanted to join the fighting forces and felt that as miners they would not be valued. The first Bevin Boys began work, having completed their training, on 14 February 1944. Programme Selection of conscripts To make the process random, one of Bevin's secretaries each week, from 14 December 1943, pulled a digit from a hat containing all ten digits, 0‚Äì9, and all men liable for call-up that week whose National Service registration number ended in that digit were directed to work in the mines, with the exception of any selected for highly skilled war work such as flying planes and in submarines, and men found physically unfit for mining. Conscripted miners came from many different trades and professions, from desk work to heavy manual labour, and included some who might otherwise have become commissioned officers. An appeals process was set up, to allow conscripts the opportunity to challenge the decision to send them to the pits, although decisions were rarely overturned. Those who refused to serve in the mines were imprisoned. By 31 May 1944, 285 conscripts had refused to serve as miners, of whom 135 had been prosecuted and 32 had been given a prison sentence. By the end of November 1944, out of a total of 16,000 conscripts, 143 had refused to serve in the mines and had been sent to prison, some with the imposition of hard labour. Training A classroom lecture where Bevin Boys are learning about the Davy lamp at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in February 1945 Boys when they were nearly 18 years old received an official postcard instructing them in five days time to report to a training centre such as at Cresswell Colliery, Derbyshire.Interview 29 August 2019 with ex-Bevin Boy Kenneth Jones born 1926. Bevin Boys with no previous experience of mining, were given six weeks' training (four in a classroom-type setting and two at their assigned colliery). For their first four weeks of underground work, they were supervised by an experienced miner. With the exception of those working in the south Wales coalfields, the conscripts could not work at the coalface until they had accrued four months' experience underground. For the most part, the Bevin Boys were not directly involved in cutting coal from the mine face, but acted instead as colliers assistants, responsible for filling tubs or wagons and hauling them back to the shaft for transport to the surface. Conscripts were supplied with helmets and steel-capped safety boots. Pay and working conditions Almost as soon as the first Bevin Boys had reported for training, there were complaints that their remuneration (44 shillings per week for an 18-year-old) were barely sufficient to cover living costs. Some 140 went on strike in Doncaster for two days before their training had finished. There were also complaints from experienced miners, who resented the fact that a 21-year-old recruit received the same minimum wage as they did. Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the oldest clothes they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.Called Up Sent Down : The Bevin Boys' War ‚Äì Tom Hickman Pub. The History Press 2008 Contemporary attitudes to Bevin Boys Many Bevin Boys suffered taunts as they wore no uniform, and there were accusations by some people that they were deliberately avoiding military conscription. Since a number of conscientious objectors were sent to work down the mines as an alternative to military service (under a system wholly separate from the Bevin Boy programme), there was sometimes an assumption that Bevin Boys were \\"Conchies\\". The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys. In 1943 Ernest Bevin said in Parliament: : There are thousands of cases in which conscientious objectors, although they have refused to take up arms, have shown as much courage as anyone else in Civil Defence and in other walks of life. :Ernest Bevin, 9 December 1943 End of programme The final conscription ballot took place in May 1945 (shortly before VE Day), however the final conscripts were not released from service until March 1948. Recognition of contribution to the war effort Within a few months of the first Bevin Boys starting work, there were calls for a badge to be awarded in recognition of the importance of their national service,. After the war, Bevin Boys received neither medals nor the right to return to the jobs they had previously held. (Like Forces veterans, they were entitled to participate in the Government's Further Education and Training Scheme, which paid university fees and an annual means-tested grant of up to ¬£426 to cover living expenses whilst studying.) The role played by Bevin Boys in Britain's war effort was not fully recognised until 1995, 50 years after VE Day, when Queen Elizabeth II mentioned them in a speech. On 20 June 2007, Tony Blair informed the House of Commons that thousands of conscripts who worked in mines during the Second World War would be awarded a veterans badge similar to the HM armed forces badge awarded by the Ministry of Defence. The first badges were awarded on 25 March 2008 by the then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, at a reception in 10 Downing Street, marking the 60th anniversary of discharge of the last Bevin Boys. On Tuesday 7 May 2013, a memorial to the Bevin Boys, based on the Bevin Boys Badge, was unveiled by the Countess of Wessex at the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire. The memorial was designed by former Bevin Boy Harry Parkes; it is made of four stone plinths carved from grey Kilkenny stone from the Republic of Ireland. The stone should turn black over time, to resemble the coal that the miners extracted. The Bevin Boys Association is trying to trace all 48,000 Bevin Boy conscripts, optants or volunteers who served in Britain's coal mines during and after the war, from 1943 to 1948.

The aim is to \\"reduce the disadvantage of people facing the civil and family justice system without a lawyer, enabling them to access justice\\" and believe that \\"no one should face court alone\\". Support Through Court does not offer legal advice, but provides support to clients in a variety of other ways including: explaining how the court system works, helping to fill in court forms and papers, and accompanying clients to their hearings.  History  The Personal Support Unit was founded in 2001 at the Royal Courts of Justice The PSU was founded in 2001, led by Diana Copisarow OBE, Michael Naish and Mark Sheldon CBE. Whilst volunteering at the Old bailey for the Witness Service, Lady Copisarow supported an unrepresented litigant through contested divorce proceedings at the Royal Courts. The litigant's experience was horrendous as she faced the confusion of the court system, uncertainty about appearing before a judge, and the general emotions of litigation. These experiences drove Lady Copisarow, Michael Naish and Mark Sheldon CBE to establish the PSU to meet the human, non-legal, needs of people attending court alone and without legal representation. The PSU grew rapidly from 2007 onwards. Following changes to legal aid in 2012, the PSU had a rise in demand for its services and now operates from 23 courts in 17 different cities across England and Wales. In 2014 the PSU won the Guardian's 'Small Charity, Big Difference' Award. In February 2017 the PSU reached the milestone of having helped on over 200,000 occasions. In October 2019 the PSU was rebranded to Support Through Court to convey more effectively the services offered to litigants in persons. In February 2020 Support Through Court launched its National Helpline to offer individuals who cannot commute to an office an alternative method of accessing its services. In April 2020 Support Through Court won the SME News' 'Best Legal Support Volunteers 2020, England and Wales' Award.  Aims and Principles  Support Through Court aim's to reduce the disadvantage of people facing the civil and family justice system without a lawyer, enabling them to access justice. Support Through Court believes that no one should face court alone and their vision is that every person in England and Wales who wants help should be able to access the help of a Support Through Court volunteer. Support Through Court volunteers can: * Explain how the court works, help fill in forms, organise papers, and discuss settling issues without going to court * Help plan what you want to say in court, and if needed accompany you in court to take notes and help afterwards * Provide details of other specialist agencies and help you find out whether you can get free legal advice  Impact  Support Through Court volunteers will help with any aspect of civil legal proceedings: over half of Support Through Court help is in a family matter, with two thirds of these cases concerning children; nearly 17% of cases involve a money claim; and 14% concern housing problems, which often place people at risk of homelessness. Many of their clients are vulnerable and disadvantaged, and to Support Through Court volunteers for reassurance and guidance. Most clients cannot afford a lawyer and are not eligible for legal aid. In 2017-18 the PSU helped clients on a record 65,000 occasions. After being helped by a Support Through Court volunteer, 98% of clients report that they feel the Support Through Court helped them get a fairer hearing.

He thought it was the name of a king or another great man. When John asked him in which book he had found the expression, the scholar answered: in the missal. And fetching the book, he showed his master at the end of one column the words in die and at the beginning of the next the word busillis - which, correctly grouped, makes in diebus illis. Master John, seeing that, said to him: \\"Considering that the word originates from a holy page, that is from the gospel, I will inquire it tomorrow with the audience in my public lesson.\\" The master did so, and answered by the laughter of all, he took the occasion to show by more examples what shame and scandal was brought over the clergy by their dark ignorance and illiterateness. John of Cornwall, in Latin Johannes Cornubiensis or Johannes de Sancto Germano was a Christian scholar and teacher, who was living in Paris about 1176. He is not to be confused with the fourteenth-century John of Cornwall who expounded Latin at his grammar school in English instead of French. There was also an archdeacon of Worcester called John of Cornwall around 1197, who probably was a different person. Life and writings Little is known of his life. From his names, it is surmised that he was a native of St Germans in Cornwall. He studied with Peter Lombard in Paris, and wrote Eulogium ad Alexandrum Papam III, quod Christus sit aliquis homo, a treatise refuting Abelard's doctrine that the humanity of Jesus was only a garment clothing the Logos. The Eulogium (dated 1176 or later) was printed by Edmond Mart√®ne in Thesaurus novus anecdotum (Paris, 1717), and by Jacques Paul Migne's in Patrologiae Latinae Cursus Completus (1844-1855), vol.

Such extremely elongated orbits have the advantage of long dwell times at a point in the sky during the approach to, and descent from, apogee. Bodies moving through the long apogee dwell appear to move slowly, and remain at high altitude over high-latitude ground sites for long periods of time. This makes these elliptical orbits useful for communications satellites. Geostationary orbits cannot serve high latitudes due to their altitude from ground sites being too low. Sirius Satellite Radio used inclined HEO orbits, specifically the Tundra orbits, to keep two satellites positioned above North America while another satellite quickly sweeps through the southern part of its 24-hour orbit.

Prelude Following the loss of a number of Aegean Islands to Greece during the first phase of the war in 1912, and its first defeat at the Battle of Elli, the Ottoman Navy sought to check Greek progress by destroying the Greek fleet docked at the port of Moudros, Lemnos. However, it faced the problem of countering the Greek flagship, the , which had already defeated them at Elli. The Ottomans developed the plan to slip a fast cruiser through the Greek patrols for a raiding mission in the Aegean, hoping to draw off some Greek ships, possibly even the Georgios Averof itself, in pursuit, leaving the remainder weakened for the Ottoman fleet to attack. Indeed, the cruiser evaded the Greek lookout ships on the night of 13/14 January 1913, and sunk a Greek transport ship at Syros the next day, also bombarding the island's harbour. This action caused concern in Athens, and an order was sent to the Fleet, commanding it to \\"sail immediately in pursuit\\". Admiral Kountouriotis refused to obey, suspecting an Ottoman trap, and instead prepared for the inevitable exit of the Ottoman Fleet from the Dardanelles Straits. On the Ottoman side, efforts were made to uplift the morale of the crews, including the hoisting of the original banner of the great corsair and admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa on the flagship, , which was named after him. Battle Pisa-class armoured cruiser . Brandenburg-class pre-dreadnought battleship . The Greek fleet, led by Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis was composed of its 9,960 ton armored cruiser flagship , the three old ironclad battleships , and and seven destroyers, while the Ottoman flotilla, led by Captain Ramiz Bey included the pre-dreadnought battleships Barbaros Hayreddin, and and the cruiser , and five destroyers. The old ironclad remained in the Dardanelles and did not participate in the battle. At 08:20 on the morning of January 5, the Greek patrols signalled that the Ottoman fleet had appeared. At 09:45, the Greek fleet sailed from Moudros Bay. The two fleets met some 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) SE of Lemnos, sailing southeast in converging columns, with their flagships in front. The gunnery exchange commenced at 11:34, when the two fleets were at a distance of 8400 meters (9186 yards). Immediately the Greek column turned left, further diminishing the distance. Soon after, the Mecidiye and the accompanying destroyers turned northeast towards the Dardanelles, followed by the Mes√ªdiye at 11:50, after it had suffered heavy damage from the combined fire of Hydra and Psara. At 11:54, a successful salvo from the Georgios Averof hit the Barbaros Hayreddin, destroying its middle tower, forcing it to withdraw towards the Dardanelles, along with the Turgut Reis at 12:00. As at Elli, the Georgios Averof commenced independent action, using its superior speed, and maneuvering so that it could use the artillery of both its sides, to pursue the Ottoman ships, while the older battleships followed as fast as they could. The pursuit ended finally at 14:30, as the Ottoman ships were nearing the Dardanelles. Aftermath Throughout the battle, the Ottoman ships achieved an excellent rate of fire, firing about 800 shells, but with dismal accuracy. Only two hits were registered on the Georgios Averof, causing one injury and minor damages, while the other battleships escaped unscathed. The Ottoman ships suffered far more. Barbaros Hayreddin was hit by over 20 shells, which destroyed much of its artillery, and suffered 32 dead and 45 wounded. Turgut Reis suffered a major leak and other minor damages from 17 hits, and 9 dead and 49 wounded. Mes√ªdiye also suffered several hits, but the main damage was caused by a 270mm shell which destroyed the central 150mm gun platform, and caused 68 casualties. This, the final naval battle of the First Balkan War, forced the Ottoman Navy to retreat to its base within the Dardanelles, from which it did not venture for the rest of the war, thus ensuring the dominion of the Aegean Sea by Greece. For the Greeks, the withdrawal of the Ottoman fleet within the Dardanelles was confirmed by 1st Lieutenant Michael Moutoussis and Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis on January 24, 1913. They conducted a naval aviation mission, flying their Maurice Farman hydroplane over the Nagara naval base, where they spotted the enemy fleet. During their sortie, they accurately drew a diagram of the positions of the Ottoman fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. Moutoussis and Moraitinis travelled over 180 kilometers (111.8 miles) and took 140 minutes to complete their mission, which was extensively reported in both the Greek and international press.

It takes its name from the Kootenay River, which in turn was named for the Kutenai First Nations people. Boundaries Various permutations of the boundaries of the Kootenays The Kootenays are more or less defined by the Kootenay Land District, though some variation exists in terms of what areas are or are not a part. The strictest definition of the region is the drainage basin of the lower Kootenay River from its re-entry into Canada near Creston, through to its confluence with the Columbia at Castlegar (illustrated by a, right). In most interpretations, however, the region also includes: * an area to the east which encompasses the upper drainage basin of the Kootenay River from its rise in the Rocky Mountains to its passage into the United States at Newgate. This adds a region spanning from the Purcell Mountains to the Alberta border, and includes Rocky Mountain Trench cities such as Cranbrook and Kimberley and the Elk Valley of the southern Canadian Rockies, centred on Fernie. This region also includes part of the Flathead River drainage basin. (illustrated by b) * an area to the southwest encompassing the Columbia's drainage from the Kootenay confluence south to the U.S. Border plus the Salmo River basin. This adds the communities of Rossland, Castlegar, Fruitvale and Salmo (illustrated by c) Some or all of the following areas to the north, which drain into the Columbia River, are also commonly included in the Kootenays: * The Arrow Lakes area, which adds Nakusp. (illustrated by d) * The Upper Columbia Valley, which parallels the first section of the Kootenay River, including the communities of Invermere and Radium Hot Springs (illustrated by e) * The Columbia drainage between the Kicking Horse Pass and the Rogers Pass, in and around the town of Golden. (illustrated by f) * The Columbia drainage between the Rogers Pass and the Eagle Pass, in and around the town of Revelstoke. (illustrated by g) When the above regions are added, sometimes the region's name is morphed into Columbia-Kootenay or Kootenay- Columbia, although that terminology also includes the Big Bend Country and Kinbasket Lake, to the north of Golden and Revelstoke, which is not generally considered part of the Kootenays, though part of the Kootenay Land District. Finally, the Boundary Country, a southern east-west corridor between the Okanagan and the Bonanza Pass and drained by the basins of the Kettle and Granby Rivers, is sometimes mentioned as being in the West Kootenay, and in other reckonings as being part of the Okanagan. In actuality, the settlement of the Boundary Country predates development in either of the regions it is now attached to, as is also the case with the Similkameen Country to the west of the Okanagan. In some descriptions, the Boundary Country includes Osoyoos and Oliver in the South Okanagan (rather than the other way around). The Boundary Country is (illustrated by h) In the event of its inclusion, the Kootenays could be described as the complete Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin minus lands drained by the Okanagan River. Naming and subdivision Contingent on the above boundaries, the Kootenays are commonly split either into East and West, or East, Central and West. In general use amongst locals of the area, the \\"East/West\\" convention is more common as a descriptor of where someone is from or where a town is located (rather than splitting the region into \\"East/Central/West\\" subregions). That being said: * The usual East-West separator is the Purcell Mountains, a range running north/south through the region. Areas to the east of this range are deemed to be in \\"East Kootenay\\" or the \\"East Kootenays\\" while places west of this division are in \\"West Kootenay\\" or the \\"West Kootenays\\". This places Creston and points east in the East Kootenay (or East Kootenays) and Crawford Bay, Salmo and points west in the West Kootenay (or West Kootenays). * The usual East-Central-West separators are the Purcell Mountains splitting East from Central and the Selkirk Mountains splitting Central from West. It remains unclear why both Kootenay and Kootenays are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the area. The plural form is in reference to The Kootenays, both East and West; the singular is in reference to the Kootenay Region. In practice the two terms are used interchangeably, although one indicates a geographical region and the other a legal boundary, the Kootenay Land District, which was identical with the original federal and provincial Kootenay ridings. Economy Once settled by miners and smelter workers - the area experienced a silver rush in the 1890s, the district now contains an important fruit-growing section (Creston Valley) and numerous commercial centres, including Grand Forks, Kaslo, Robson, Ymir, Warfield, Montrose, Fruitvale, Salmo, Trail, Nelson, Slocan, Playmor, Winlaw, Cranbrook, Kimberley, Fernie, Castlegar, Rossland, Erickson, and Creston. A number of Community Radio stations have developed in the region, most notably CJLY-FM in Nelson and CIDO-FM in Creston. These stations usually operate either as Cooperatives or as non-profit Societies.

Even though it was a copy, it was manufactured using Soviet industrial plants and gave the Soviets valuable experience which later enabled the USSR to construct its own much more capable rockets. The R-1 missile system entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950.  History  In 1945 the Soviets captured several key V-2 rocket production facilities, and also gained the services of some German scientists and engineers related to the project. In particular the Soviets gained control of the main V-2 manufacturing facility at Nordhausen, and had 30 V-2 missiles assembled there by September 1946. In October 1946 the Soviets transferred the German missile engineers working for them to a special research facility near Moscow, where they were forced to remain until the mid-1950s. The Soviets established a missile design bureau of their own (OKB-1), under the direction of Sergei Korolev. This team was directed to create a Soviet capability to build missiles, starting with a Soviet copy of the German V-2 and moving to more advanced, Soviet-designed missiles in the near future.  Description  Drawing of the Soviet R-1 missile, NATO code SS-1 Scunner In April 1947 Stalin authorised the production of the R-1 missile, the designation for the Soviet copy of V-2. The first tests of the missile began in September 1948. The system was accepted by the Soviet army in November 1950. The R-1 missile could carry a warhead of conventional explosive to a maximum range of , with an accuracy of about . The first A4 rocket (from German stocks) is transported to the launch site on a truck trailer. It was launched on 18 October 1947 from the Kapustin Yar test site The first V-2 rocket was transported to the Kapustin Yar test site and launched on 18 October 1947. It flew 206.7 km and deviated left for 30 km. The R-1A was tested, a variant with a separable warhead later in 1947. High-altitude scientific experiments were conducted with two of the R-1As, and later a series of specialized scientific rockets were built on the basis of the R-1: The R-1B, R-1V, R-1D and R-1E. These carried dogs, and experiments to analyze the upper atmosphere, measure cosmic rays and take far-UV spectra of the Sun. The R-1 missile system entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950. The R-1's insulated electrical wiring attracted vermin. In one January 1953 incident, thousands of flood- displaced mice disabled many rockets by eating the insulation, requiring \\"hundreds of cats and repairmen\\".

This was an improved version of the German V-2 rocket manufactured by the Soviet Union.  Description  The R-1 was quickly followed by an evolutionary improvement, the R-2 (SS-2), which had a longer range and at least four major differences in design. The weight was increased by 50%, but the range was more than doubled, to . R-2 had the following major differences from the R-1's (and hence from the V-2's) design: *The warhead separated from the rocket prior to atmospheric reentry, eliminating the hull strength problem, one of the V-2/R-1's biggest weaknesses. *The propellant tank became the main load- bearing structure for the rocket, in contrast to the R-1's load-bearing hull. This reduced the overall weight of the spaceframe. *The control module was moved from above the propellant tank to below the LOx tank. This made pre- launch preparations easier. As the control module was now placed directly over the engine, vibrations were reduced by using steel instead of aluminium for the tailcone. *Radio command guidance was introduced to improve accuracy, giving the R-2 accuracy comparable to the R-1, in spite of its doubled range. The first test flight of the R-2 took place in September 1949, and it was accepted for service in November 1951, actually entering service in large numbers around 1953. A grand total of 1,545 R-1 and R-2 missiles were produced. The R-2 missile was the last Soviet missile based on German designs. While some German influences would clearly remain, Soviet missiles after the R-2 would be based on original designs by the OKB-1 group. The R-2A geophysical rocket was developed for vertical sounding flights. It carried dogs, monkeys, hamsters, and various high-altitude physics experiments in its nose cone. Two pods performed atmospheric analysis and were ejected from the missile's side to avoid contamination by engine exhaust. The R-2 design was exported to China, where it was built as the Dongfeng 1.

While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early analytic philosophy. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time). Ancient and medieval views The earliest recorded philosophy of time was expounded by the ancient Egyptian thinker Ptahhotep (c. 2650‚Äì2600 BC) who said: The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy, dating back to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.

Allen, Handbook of Inca mythology, p. 86, () Plato, in the Timaeus, identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies, and space as that in which things come to be. Aristotle, in Book IV of his Physics, defined time as the number of changes with respect to before and after, and the place of an object as the innermost motionless boundary of that which surrounds it. In Book 11 of St. Augustine's Confessions, he ruminates on the nature of time, asking, \\"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.\\" He goes on to comment on the difficulty of thinking about time, pointing out the inaccuracy of common speech: \\"For but few things are there of which we speak properly; of most things we speak improperly, still the things intended are understood.\\"St. Augustine, Confessions, Book 11. http://www.sacred- texts.com/chr/augconf/aug11.htm (Accessed 19/5/14). But Augustine presented the first philosophical argument for the reality of Creation (against Aristotle) in the context of his discussion of time, saying that knowledge of time depends on the knowledge of the movement of things, and therefore time cannot be where there are no creatures to measure its passing (Confessions Book XI ¬∂30; City of God Book XI ch.6). In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning, now known as Temporal finitism. The Christian philosopher John Philoponus presented early arguments, adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians of the form \\"argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite\\", which states: :\\"An actual infinite cannot exist.\\" :\\"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.\\" :\\"‚à¥ An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.\\" In the early 11th century, the Muslim physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen or Alhazen) discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his Book of Optics (1021). He also rejected Aristotle's definition of topos (Physics IV) by way of geometric demonstrations and defined place as a mathematical spatial extension.Nader El-Bizri, 'In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 17 (2007), 57‚Äì80 His experimental proof of the intro-mission model of vision led to changes in the understanding of the visual perception of space, contrary to the previous emission theory of vision supported by Euclid and Ptolemy. In \\"tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.\\" Realism and anti- realism A traditional realist position in ontology is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. Idealists, by contrast, deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some anti-realists, whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space. In 1781, Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason, one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an a priori notion that, together with other a priori notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant holds that neither space nor time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although space and time are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense, they are also empirically real‚Äîthat is, not mere illusions. Some idealist writers, such as J. M. E. McTaggart in The Unreality of Time, have argued that time is an illusion (see also The flow of time, below). The writers discussed here are for the most part realists in this regard; for instance, Gottfried Leibniz held that his monads existed, at least independently of the mind of the observer. Absolutism and relationalism Leibniz and Newton The great debate between defining notions of space and time as real objects themselves (absolute), or mere orderings upon actual objects (relational), began between physicists Isaac Newton (via his spokesman, Samuel Clarke) and Gottfried Leibniz in the papers of the Leibniz‚ÄìClarke correspondence. Arguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of thought experiments with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing. The example Leibniz uses involves two proposed universes situated in absolute space. The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe's position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else. Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles. Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the bucket argument: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops. In this response, Clarke argues for the necessity of the existence of absolute space to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely relationalist account. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket as well as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing‚Äîabsolute space. Leibniz describes a space that exists only as a relation between objects, and which has no existence apart from the existence of those objects. Motion exists only as a relation between those objects. Newtonian space provided the absolute frame of reference within which objects can have motion. In Newton's system, the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. These objects can be described as moving in relation to space itself. For almost two centuries, the evidence of a concave water surface held authority. Mach Another important figure in this debate is 19th-century physicist Ernst Mach. While he did not deny the existence of phenomena like that seen in the bucket argument, he still denied the absolutist conclusion by offering a different answer as to what the bucket was rotating in relation to: the fixed stars. Mach suggested that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat. Mach argued that, in effect, the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat. But if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating. The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water. Mach argued that the momentum of an object, whether angular or linear, exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe (Mach's Principle). Einstein Albert Einstein proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the principle of relativity. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by Maxwell's equations, which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the luminiferous ether. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate. All attempts to measure any speed relative to this ether failed, which can be seen as a confirmation of Einstein's postulate that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. Special relativity is a formalization of the principle of relativity that does not contain a privileged inertial frame of reference, such as the luminiferous ether or absolute space, from which Einstein inferred that no such frame exists. Einstein generalized relativity to frames of reference that were non-inertial. He achieved this by positing the Equivalence Principle, which states that the force felt by an observer in a given gravitational field and that felt by an observer in an accelerating frame of reference are indistinguishable. This led to the conclusion that the mass of an object warps the geometry of the space-time surrounding it, as described in Einstein's field equations. In classical physics, an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate. In general relativity, an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a geodesic of space-time. An object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force. An object in free fall does not experience a force, because it is following a geodesic. An object standing on the earth, however, will experience a force, as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet. Einstein partially advocates Mach's principle in that distant stars explain inertia because they provide the gravitational field against which acceleration and inertia occur. But contrary to Leibniz's account, this warped space-time is as integral a part of an object as are its other defining characteristics, such as volume and mass. If one holds, contrary to idealist beliefs, that objects exist independently of the mind, it seems that relativistics commits them to also hold that space and temporality have exactly the same type of independent existence. Conventionalism The position of conventionalism states that there is no fact of the matter as to the geometry of space and time, but that it is decided by convention. The first proponent of such a view, Henri Poincar√©, reacting to the creation of the new non-Euclidean geometry, argued that which geometry applied to a space was decided by convention, since different geometries will describe a set of objects equally well, based on considerations from his sphere-world. This view was developed and updated to include considerations from relativistic physics by Hans Reichenbach. Reichenbach's conventionalism, applying to space and time, focuses around the idea of coordinative definition. Coordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the wavelength of cadmium to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition. Such a use of coordinative definition is in effect, on Reichenbach's conventionalism, in the General Theory of Relativity where light is assumed, i.e. not discovered, to mark out equal distances in equal times. After this setting of coordinative definition, however, the geometry of spacetime is set. As in the absolutism/relationalism debate, contemporary philosophy is still in disagreement as to the correctness of the conventionalist doctrine. Structure of space-time Building from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of space-time have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the philosophy of physics. The following is a short list of topics. Relativity of simultaneity According to special relativity each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the Rietdijk‚ÄìPutnam argument to demonstrate that relativity predicts a block universe in which events are fixed in four dimensions. Invariance vs. covariance Bringing to bear the lessons of the absolutism/relationalism debate with the powerful mathematical tools invented in the 19th and 20th century, Michael Friedman draws a distinction between invariance upon mathematical transformation and covariance upon transformation. Invariance, or symmetry, applies to objects, i.e. the symmetry group of a space-time theory designates what features of objects are invariant, or absolute, and which are dynamical, or variable. Covariance applies to formulations of theories, i.e. the covariance group designates in which range of coordinate systems the laws of physics hold. This distinction can be illustrated by revisiting Leibniz's thought experiment, in which the universe is shifted over five feet. In this example the position of an object is seen not to be a property of that object, i.e. location is not invariant. Similarly, the covariance group for classical mechanics will be any coordinate systems that are obtained from one another by shifts in position as well as other translations allowed by a Galilean transformation. In the classical case, the invariance, or symmetry, group and the covariance group coincide, but they part ways in relativistic physics. The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects. The formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations. As such the covariance group of the general theory of relativity is just the covariance group of every theory. Historical frameworks A further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language. In these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a manifold paired with vector spaces, the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed. For example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position and is Galilean invariant, but does not have special positions. Holes With the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime substantivalism, offered by John Earman is known as the \\"hole argument\\". This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows: Define a function d as the identity function over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small neighbourhood H belonging to M. Over H d comes to differ from identity by a smooth function. With use of this function d we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying d to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time t=0, where t is a time function created by a foliation of spacetime, but differ after t=0. These considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism. Direction of time The problem of the direction of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant.Borchert, D.M. (2006) Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Ed. Vol. 9. MI: Cengage Learning. P. 468. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future. Causation solution One solution to this problem takes a metaphysical view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of causation. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effect that is our perception. We feel we can't affect the past and can affect the future because we can't affect the past and can affect the future. There are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others. However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non- animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between i) temporal direction and ii) the implications of form and functional capacity. The application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general. Thermodynamics solution The second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics. The answer from classical thermodynamics states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time- reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the second law of thermodynamics states that the net entropy of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together. But in statistical mechanics things become more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law. Current thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy. Laws solution A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time- asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes. One recent proponent of the laws solution is Tim Maudlin who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: \\"[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past\\" [ibid, 2010 edition, p. 108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive. Flow of time The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart, in which he proposes two \\"temporal series\\". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other. The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than. In many ways, the debate between proponents of these two views can be seen as a continuation of the early modern debate between the view that there is absolute time (defended by Isaac Newton) and the view that there is only merely relative time (defended by Gottfried Leibniz). McTaggart, in his paper \\"The Unreality of Time\\", argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it. Building from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart's arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.  Dualities  Quantum field theory models have shown that it is possible for theories in two different space-time backgrounds, like AdS/CFT or T-duality, to be equivalent. Presentism and eternalism According to Presentism, time is an ordering of various realities. At a certain time some things exist and others do not. This is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that Homer exists because at the present time he does not. An Eternalist, on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things--past, present and future--can be said to be just as real as things in the present. According to this theory, then, Homer really does exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time--just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words near, far, above, below, and such are directly comparable to phrases such as in the past, a minute ago, and so on). Endurantism and perdurantism The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its \\"temporal parts\\" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists such as David Lewis have attacked this position. They argue that perdurantism is the superior view for its ability to take account of change in objects. On the whole, Presentists are also endurantists and Eternalists are also perdurantists (and vice versa), but this is not a necessary relation and it is possible to claim, for instance, that time's passage indicates a series of ordered realities, but that objects within these realities somehow exist outside of the reality as a whole, even though the realities as wholes are not related. However, such positions are rarely adopted.

Car makers frequently arbitrage markets, setting the price according to local market conditions so the same vehicle will have different real prices in different territories. Grey import vehicles circumvent this profit-maximization strategy. Car makers and local distributors sometimes regard grey imports as a threat to their network of franchised dealerships, but independent distributors do not since more cars of an odd brand bring in money from service and spare parts. In order for the arbitrage to work, there must be some means to reduce, eliminate, or reverse whatever savings could be achieved by purchasing the car in the lower-priced territory. Examples of such barriers include regulations preventing import or requiring costly vehicle modifications. In some countries, such as Vietnam, the import of grey-market vehicles has largely been banned. Overview A Honda Stepwgn as seen in the Philippines, converted to left-hand drive. Right-hand drive vehicles are not allowed to be used in the country except in freeport zones, and are thus modified to be driven legally. Grey imports are generally used vehicles, although some are new, particularly in Europe where the European Union tacitly approves grey imports from other EU countries.[ European Commission Frequently Asked Questions on Passenger car related taxation Retrieved July 29, 2015 In 1998, the European Commission fined Volkswagen for attempting to prevent prospective buyers from Germany and Austria from going to Italy to buy new VWs at lower pre-tax prices; pre-tax price is lower in Italy, as in Denmark, due to higher tax on cars. It is even possible for car buyers in the United Kingdom to buy right-hand drive cars in EU countries with right-hand traffic where left-hand drive cars are the norm.Rutherford, Mike The Daily Telegraph Buying a car doesn't have to be taxing June 2, 2010 Retrieved July 29, 2015 Japanese used vehicle exporting is a large global business, as rigorous road tests and high depreciation make such vehicles worth very little (in Japan) after six years, and strict environmental laws make vehicle disposal expensive. Consequently, it is profitable to export them to other countries with left-hand traffic, such as Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Malta, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Cyprus. Some have even been exported to countries such as Peru, Paraguay, Russia, Mongolia, Yemen, Burma, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates, despite the fact that these countries drive on the right. It is actually because of these vehicles' RHD configuration that many of them are sent to LHD countries in the first place, for use as mail delivery vehicles. Many Japanese market Jeep Cherokees, for example, have found new use with rural mail carriers in the United States. Thailand is the third largest exporter of brand new and used right-hand drive cars after Japan and Singapore, because of that country's high-volume production of diesel 4x4 vehicles such as the Toyota Hilux Vigo, Toyota Fortuner, Mitsubishi L200, Nissan Navara, Ford Ranger, Chevy Colorado, and others. The Toyota Vigo is the most exported vehicle by parallel exporters. Unlike Japanese and Singaporean exports, the majority of Thailand's grey exports are of new vehicles and the market is dominated by two companies. These trucks are also exported to Japan due to Japanese domestic makers no longer officially selling them through authorized dealers there. Similarly, there are exports of left hand drive (LHD) used cars from Germany to countries in Eastern Europe, some EU countries (less likely Spain, Portugal and Greece) and West Africa (especially Ghana and Nigeria, not Senegal and its surrounding countries). Some cars in the United States are sold only as export by insurance companies due to them having been stolen and recovered, or damaged in other ways.http://www.usedcarsforsalebyowner.com/ By country United States Because it has not signed onto United Nations Economic Commission for Europe standards for automobile design (see World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations), the United States continues to use a unique set of motor vehicle safety and emission regulations.

They differ significantly from the international UN Regulations used throughout the rest of the world. Vehicle manufacturers thus face considerable expense to type-certify a vehicle for U.S. sale this amount is not widely publicized, but Automotive News cites a 2013 model vehicle where this modification cost US$42 million.Beene, Ryan [http://www.autonews.com/article/20150725/OEM/307279968/wiping-out-u.s.-eu- rules-disparities-would-yield-big-savings Automotive News July 25, 2015.

However, larger companies such as Alfa Romeo and Peugeot have also cited costs of \\"federalizing\\" their vehicle lineups as a disincentive to re-enter the U.S. market.http://www.veloceregister.net/alfaromeo.htm NHTSA and EPA regulations criminalize the possession of a vehicle not meeting U.S. standards. Exceptions exist for foreign nationals touring the U.S. in their own vehicle and for cars imported for Show and Display purposes. During the Second World War American servicemen stationed in Europe began to experience the benefits of the nimble British sports cars, and many shipped them home on their return. There were no legal restrictions to this behavior until 1967. Some owners even acted as sales reps for manufacturers who were happy to help, leading to official imports and the British sports car craze in North America. As with future waves of imported cars, this led the U.S. automakers to respond by introducing home grown models, such as the Chevrolet Corvette. Beginning in 1968, U.S. regulations surrounding vehicle importing became harsher, and many vehicles, like the Mini, were immediately excluded from the market. Because of the unavailability of certain car models, demand for grey market vehicles arose during the Malaise era in the late 1970s. Importing them into the US involved modifying or adding certain equipment, such as headlamps, sidemarker lights, bumpers, and a catalytic converter as required by the relevant regulations. The NHTSA and EPA would review the paperwork and then approve possession of the vehicle. It was also possible for these agencies to reject the application and order the automobile destroyed or re-exported The grey market provided an alternative method for Americans to acquire desirable vehicles, and still obtain certification. Tens of thousands of cars were imported this way each year during the 1980s. The vast majority of these imports were by individuals importing just one car. Penetrating the market via the grey market first, is a valid market entry strategy. The Lamborghini Countach was one of the first grey market vehicles (from 1976 to 1985), and the Range Rover and Mercedes- Benz G-Class were initially available only through the grey market as well. These automakers later made US models to meet the demand. Many vehicles otherwise unavailable entered the US via the grey market, like the Citro√´n CX and Renault 5 Turbo. This avenue of vehicle availability was increasingly successful, especially in cases where the US model of a vehicle was less powerful and/or less well equipped than versions available in other markets. For example, Mercedes-Benz chose to offer only the sluggish 380SEL model in 1981 to Americans, some of whom wanted the much faster 500SEL available in the rest of the world. BMW had the same issue with their 745i Turbo. The grey market was successful enough that it ate significantly into the business of Mercedes-Benz of North America and their dealers. The corporation launched a successful million-dollar congressional lobbying effort to stop private importation of vehicles not officially intended for the U.S. market. An organisation called AICA (Automotive Importers Compliance Association) was formed by importers in California, Florida, New York, Texas, and elsewhere to counter some of these actions by Mercedes lobbyists, but the Motor Vehicle Safety Compliance Act was passed in 1988, effectively ending private import of grey-market vehicles to the United States. There have been allegations of improper lobbying, but the issue has never been raised in court. As a result of being practically banned, the grey market declined from 66,900 vehicles in 1985 to 300 vehicles in 1995. It is no longer possible to import a non-U.S. vehicle into the United States as a personal import, with four exceptions, none of which permits Americans to buy recent vehicles not officially available in the United States. A vehicle not originally built to U.S. specifications can, under certain circumstances be imported through a registered importer or independent commercial importer, who modifies the vehicle to comply with US equipment and safety regulations and then certifies it as compliant. In practice, this avenue is nearly impossible, even for Bill Gates. Those who import nonconforming motor vehicles sometimes bring in more than one car at a time to spread the substantial cost of the necessary destructive testing, modification, and safety certification. Destructive crash testing is not always needed if the vehicle can be shown to be substantially similar to a model sold in the U.S. As with the earlier G-Wagen and 560SEL, Mercedes-Benz was able to use the grey market to read market signals with the Smart Fortwo, which was imported in this manner in 2004‚Äì2006, prior to its official U.S. release in 2007. Even Canadian-market vehicles may not meet these requirements.Importing Canadian Vehicles, Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 2014-12-12. Since Canadian regulations are similar to those in the U.S., an individual can import a vehicle manufactured to Canadian motor vehicle safety standards if the original manufacturer issues a letter stating that the vehicle also conforms to U.S. motor vehicle standards. The decision to issue a compliance letter is solely at the discretion of the manufacturer, even if the vehicle is known to meet U.S. standards. Before issuing a compliance letter, most manufacturers request proof that the owner of the vehicle is a resident of Canada, and that the car was registered and used in Canada for a minimum period. This is done because the manufacturers maintain separate pricing structures for the U.S. and Canadian markets. In 1998, NHTSA granted vehicles over 25 years of age dispensation from the rules it administers, since these are presumed to be collector vehicles. However, there are two exceptions to the rule. One is California, where vehicle emissions requirements make it difficult to register a classic vehicle from overseas. (California Smog Check is mandated for automobiles 1976 and newer.) In 21 states, mini trucks (JDM market kei trucks) of any age can be legally imported and registered as a utility vehicle with on-road use and top speed restrictions varying by state, although states that allow mini trucks to be operated on public roads prohibit their operation on Interstate highways. Some Americans are interested in Japanese domestic market vehicles, like the Nissan Skyline. In 1999, a California company called Motorex had a number of Nissan Skyline R33 GTS25s crash-tested. They submitted their information to NHTSA and petitioned for 1990‚Äì1999 GT-Rs and GTSs to be declared eligible for import. Many Skylines were subsequently imported through Motorex. This lasted until late 2005, when NHTSA learned not all 1990 through 1999 Skyline models would perform identically in crash testing. Motorex had submitted information for only the R33, but had asserted that the data applied to R32, R33, and R34 models. NHTSA determined that only 1996‚Äì1998 R33 models have been demonstrated as capable of being modified to meet the federal motor vehicle safety standards, and that only those models are eligible for import. In March 2006, Motorex ceased all imports and Motorex principal Hiroaki \\"Hiro\\" Nanahoshi was arrested and held on $1 million bail on financial, kidnapping, and assault charges.LeftlaneNews R32, R34 Nissan Skyline imports halted Nissan developed the 2007 Nissan GT-R to meet this market demand in the United States. Canada Cars not originally manufactured to Canadian-market specifications may be legally imported once they are 15 or more years old. This has led to the import of many Japanese sports cars such as the Nissan Skyline. The only categorical exception to the 15-year rule is that many ‚Äì but not allList of US-specification vehicles admissible and inadmissible to Canada ‚Äì vehicles manufactured to United States-market specifications can legally be imported into Canada under the compliance modification and inspection program administered by the Registrar of Imported Vehicles. Typically, modifications to meet Canadian standards include the installation of daytime running lights and tether anchors to permit secure attachment of infant car seats, documentation indicating that any repairs required in response to the original manufacturer's factory recalls are complete, and passenger cars assembled on or after September 1, 2007 are also required to have an immobilization system that meets the CMVSS 114 standard. Labelling of the vehicle to indicate its imported status, to warn that the odometer is counting in miles (as made-for- Canada odometers have used kilometres since 1976) and to translate safety- related warning labels (such as airbag maintenance procedures) is typically also required. Speedometers in US and most Canadian vehicles indicate both miles per hour and km/h, either with dual calibration or with a single set of numbers that can be made to display miles or kilometres at the driver's option, so are usually left unmodified. In March 2007, Transport Canada initiated proposed rulemaking to change the importation laws such that vehicles not originally manufactured to Canadian-market specifications would be eligible for import only once they are 25 years old, rather than the present 15-year cutoff rule. The main impetus behind this proposal is the significant influx of Japanese-market vehicles in Canada in recent years, particularly in Western provinces such as British Columbia due to geographical proximity to Asian ports of departure. BC's public auto insurance administrative body, Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, in 2007 released a flawed research finding that right-hand drive vehicles are involved in 40% more crashes than left-hand drive vehicles in that province.

Consequently, large volumes of used cars from Japan appeared on the local market, at a time when most cars in New Zealand were locally assembled, and expensive compared to other countries, with most used cars available being comparatively old. Local buyers now had a much wider choice of models, but despite specifications being higher than so- called \\"NZ New\\" cars, there were many problems with \\"clocking\\" or odometer fraud, with the odometer wound back to display a much lower mileage. Other problems include vehicles damaged in accidents in Japan.Damaged car imports investigated, Radio New Zealand, 25 July 2013 This is in contrast to those imported from Australia, for which the history of such vehicles, including write-offs, is readily available from insurance companies.Most ex-Aust second- hand cars 'write-offs', Radio New Zealand, 27 September 2015 However, the widespread availability of used Japanese imports prompted official importers to reduce the price of brand new cars, and in 1998, New Zealand became one of the few countries in the world to remove all import tariffs on motor vehicles.Motor vehicles, boats, and aircraft , New Zealand Customs Service. Retrieved 2014-12-12. Grey market vehicles comprise a majority of cars in the national fleet. These secondhand imports have achieved 'normal' status and are used and serviced without comment throughout society. A huge industry servicing and supplying parts for these vehicles has developed. After years of trying to stop grey imports the car companies themselves have become involved, importing in competition with their own new models and providing owners with spare part and repair services. Russia and many African countries, albeit not South Africa where second-hand car imports are illegal, import large quantities of secondhand vehicles from Japan and Singapore. Nevertheless, a great many used vehicles are imported, 94.6 percent of which come from Japan, most of which are Japanese makes. Most of the other makes are German, such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen.Registration of ex-overseas cars, by make (from the Land Transport New Zealand website) There are a smaller number of United States makes such as Chevrolet and Chrysler, which were built in right hand drive for the Japanese market.Main countries of previous registration of ex-overseas (used-imports) cars (from the Land Transport New Zealand website) Although in heavy decline from 2005, used- vehicle import totals are higher than those of vehicles first registered in New Zealand. In 2006, 123,390 ex-overseas vehicles were registered, compared to 76,804 brand new vehicles. Used vehicles must, with some exceptions, be right-hand drive, and they must comply with recognised European, Australian, Japanese, or American emission and safety standards, or they are ineligible for import to New Zealand.New Zealand used-vehicle import requirements: emissions In some cases a left-hand drive vehicle can be imported into New Zealand if it meets certain conditions or is a specialized vehicle. Left-hand drive vehicles 20 years or older normally do not have to meet any special requirements but must weigh no more than 3500 kg. Ireland Japanese used car importing has been quite common in Ireland since the 1980s. The imported cars are cheaper than local used cars due to the very low value of used cars in Japan (and to an extent, used products in general), and a much larger range of specifications are available on Japanese models compared to the very limited ranges sold locally even in comparison to the UK, model ranges of Japanese cars can be very limited mostly due to the high vehicle-registration tax and other taxes imposed on new cars sold in Ireland. For example, the Toyota Corollas sold in the late 1980s up until the late 1990s (E90 and E100 series) were only available in Ireland in one specification level, with few features and only the base 1.3 litre petrol and diesel engines. In Japan, however, 1.5 and 1.6 litre engines were also available, with around 6 different trim levels, options such as sunroofs, central locking and electric windows available on many specs as early as 1989, ABS and driver airbags optional since 1991, four-wheel drive, and performance GT models. Very basic saloons and diesel-engined models with automatic transmissions also appealed to taxi drivers. In more recent years, Japanese imports have become less common with typical family cars, probably due to the great change in the Irish economy over the past 20 years people generally have larger incomes now, and sales in new cars have soared. Imports from Japan has become more of a specialty market now importing of sports models not originally available in Europe such as the Mitsubishi FTO, Toyota Corolla Levin/Toyota Sprinter Trueno, Toyota Starlet Glanza and Honda Integra has become quite popular, and sports cars like the Nissan Skyline GT-R, Toyota Supra and Mazda RX-7 are more easily available as imports. Also, small commercial kei car models such as the Daihatsu Midget II and Nissan S-Cargo are used by some businesses as advertising aids, as they are quite distinctive and eye-catching on the roads in Ireland. No modifications are required for Japanese imported cars to be registered and driven on the roads in Ireland. One disadvantage is that Japan uses a different FM radio band than everywhere else, so a band expander or a replacement stereo system is required to receive the full FM band used locally. Like all other cars used on public roads in Ireland, Japanese imports have to pass the National Car Test. Other used imports sold in Ireland are from the UK, the most readily identifiable being those from General Motors, which badges its cars in the UK as Vauxhalls, not as Opels as in Ireland. As of 2007 the number of cars being Imported into the Republic of Ireland from both Northern Ireland and Great Britain is at record high levels due to high new-car taxation in Ireland and the fact that UK cars are of a higher spec than Irish ones. This trend was highlighted by RT√â in a consumer programme entitled \\"Highly Recommended\\". United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, many people have chosen to buy new cars in other EU member states, where pre- tax prices are much lower than in the UK, and then import them into their own country, where they only pay the UK's rate of value added tax (VAT). This is especially the case in Northern Ireland, as pre-tax prices in the Republic of Ireland are kept low because of a vehicle registration tax levied on top of VAT. Other UK buyers can also request a model in RHD when ordering from a dealer in continental Europe for a small supplement. Motor dealers in the EU are compelled under EU competition law to supply right-hand drive models at the same price as LHD models should a buyer request it. Strictly speaking, such imports are known as parallel imports. Warranties on new cars bought in an EU member state are valid throughout the EU, meaning that a UK resident who has bought a new car in another member state and then imports it into the UK will be covered by the same warranty. However, whereas UK warranties tend to be for three years, those in other EU countries may be only for one or two. There are also some Japanese imported cars found in the UK, the most popular being the Mazda Eunos Roadster, Nissan Figaro and Mitsubishi Pajero as well as performance cars such as Nissan Skylines, Mitsubishi FTOs and highly tuned Subaru Impreza and Toyota Supra variants that were never officially imported into the UK. These cars tend to be cheaper than official UK imports, but often have better Japanese domestic market specification levels by comparison. The range of Japanese vehicles in the UK is rising all the time as UK customers see the impressive high spec, low-mileage Japanese vehicles on the roads. Each month new models are being imported by dealers and rapidly become popular on the UK market. Importing a vehicle from outside of the EU may require the vehicle to be subjected to an IVA test if the vehicle is under ten years of age. This test is carried out by the government agency known as the DVSA. If the vehicle is left hand drive this is fairly straightforward to submit an IVA test application and then present the vehicle to the local test station. The vehicle will likely need changes to lighting systems e.g. amber rear indicators, addition of rear foglight and correct UK headlights. If the vehicle being imported is right hand drive then it must be a personal import i.e. owned by yourself for at least 6 months and you are returning to live in the UK permanently having lived outside of the EU for at least 12 months. Australia In Australia, the commercial import of used motor vehicles is significantly regulated and restricted. The allowed imports are limited to what are called special and enthusiast vehicles, or most cars manufactured before 1 January 1989. Until the present regulations entered force at the start of 2004, cars over 15 years old could be imported, and would need to gain a roadworthy certificate (needed for registration transfer in many states anyway) and often safety modifications to ensure that they met with regulations that would have been in force at the time of their manufacture. To bring a special or enthusiast vehicle into Australia, the importer must either apply to have the car added to the SEVS register, or import a car already listed on the register. Russia In Russia, grey imports, both new and used, comprised, at certain points, up to 80% of all automobile fleets, because of domestic production being unable to meet the market demands, both in numbers and in quality, especially in the early to mid-1990s. In western Russia, most imports were from Germany, while to the east of the Ural mountains where the cost of delivery made both the German imports and domestic productions particularly unattractive, a thriving industry of importing used vehicles from Japan developed. Even though Russia is a left hand drive country, RHD vehicles are nevertheless legal there, provided that some adjustments (e.g. retuning the headlights) are made, but these are cheap and easily done, thus making the cheap and well-built Japanese cars, trucks and tractors (which proved sturdy enough to withstand severe Russian climate, bad roads, often inadequate servicing and questionable quality of fuel/oil) particularly attractive to the customer. In main import centers such as Vladivostok and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk a large-scale service and aftermarket industry developed, including parts depots, auction houses, and logistic centers, all geared for servicing and supporting this relentless import drive. The authorities tried to fight this phenomenon to protect the domestic industry, but the effects have so far been mixed. While increasingly stringent technical requirements and stiffer import tariffs had some effect, they only managed to force the locals to import newer and more expensive vehicles, and to invent various quasi-legal ways to circumvent these regulations. Japanese manufacturers themselves have also stepped in, creating local assembly plants that produce new, left hand drive models to try to compete with the grey imports. South Korean used vehicle imports become highly prominent in Vladivostok, as the solution to save Russian market from sanctions they have caused by the suspension of Japanese used vehicle imports from 2014 onwards. China The parallel market has existed to a limited extent in China for several years, especially in port cities Tianjin and Dalian. The Shanghai free trade zone has a 'car dealer' where new cars imported from other territories are sold. Due to price arbitrage, these vehicles can be significantly cheaper than the same vehicle available from the official distributor. Wall Street Journal, April 20, 2015, page B4 Philippines In the Philippines, the main source of import grey market vehicles, both passenger and commercial, is Japan. Second is Korea, third is the USA via trans-shipments through Japan. Only one port, Port Irene, Cagayan, was open to grey market passenger vehicles between 2008 and 2014. Some dispute over the legality of importation of passenger vehicles arose and led to a Port Irene ban. Currently the Executive Order 418 has been upheld, thus banning the importation of used passenger vehicles into the Philippines. Commercial vehicles, special purpose vehicles are not under EO 418 and thus are currently being imported into Subic and Poro Point, San Fernando. Subic sees roughly 1 cargo ship per week, and has many licensed locators. A second port, Poro Point is, as of February 2014, once per month and is solely facilitated by Forerunner Multi-Resources as the licensed locator, and SASTRAD KK in Japan as the sole shipper. There is a grey-area trade of used mini trucks from Japan flourishing in Cebu. Mini trucks are chopped in Japan, imported as \\"parts\\" and are re-assembled by welding chassis parts together. Cheap to buy, they are a staple of small businesses transporting goods. Japan In Japan, although the laws against grey import products were strict, and domestic car makers and authorized dealers have to conform the vehicle dimension standards and other various regulations differing from Europe and United States, the laws against grey-imported vehicles are very lax due to absence of import tariffs, and there are some grey imported vehicles that were never officially sold in the Japanese domestic market. These ranging from small city cars like Toyota Aygo and Smart ForTwo, to sports cars like AC Cobra and Chevrolet Camaro, to commercial vehicles and pickup trucks like the Toyota Tundra. Most cars were imported from their country of origin, and a few were converted to RHD, though some were later introduced to authorized dealers due to popular demand. Some grey market importers have tried to import domestically-made export-only cars, such as the Subaru BRAT and Infiniti FX, back into Japan's grey market. In Japan, the term used to refer to this scene is called , and this mainly applies to Japanese-branded vehicles. Also, due to NOx laws and some other differing regulations, pickup trucks like the Toyota Hilux are no longer officially distributed in the JDM, so importers continue to import foreign-built trucks into Japan. The concept of Gyakuyunyu is referenced in the music album Gyakuyuny≈´: K≈çwankyoku. In Japan, foreign cars sold locally have traditionally been LHD, which is regarded as exotic or a status symbol. This even applies to British brands (although cars for the British market have the steering wheel on the right), in part because many have been imported via the US. Many tollbooths in Japan have a special lane for LHD vehicles. However, some US manufacturers have made RHD models for the Japanese market (namely the Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Cavalier), though with limited success; and as continental European brands become more popular, the preference is increasingly for RHD models, many of which are re-exported to countries like New Zealand as grey imports, along with Japanese models. Sweden In Sweden, the main source of grey market vehicles is the US via Germany, which has more liberal laws and better tax deals on new imported cars. Many used cars also come from Germany, which has a bigger domestic market and rigorous roadworthiness tests. There are no age restrictions on imported vehicles, as such.  Thailand  In Thailand, most grey imports are expensive, rare, and/or sports cars. Most are right-hand drive cars from the United Kingdom or Japan, though some are brought in from the USA (as left-hand drive cars). Mercedes-Benz Thailand, an authorised distributor, does exist, but many Mercedes-Benz cars are imported and sold by grey importers. As of 2011, Mercedes-Benz Thailand has a new policy of not providing warranty work to grey-market imports. Trinidad and Tobago In Trinidad and Tobago, nearly all used imports come from Japan, with some vehicles coming from Thailand and Singapore. Before February 2016, cars under 6 years old could be legally imported. Since February 2016, no car can be imported and registered if over 4 years old. An import licence is required and most imports are through dealerships. No new importer dealerships are permitted. Senegal Grey imports from France are generally being most common in Senegal. There are also grey imports from Spain, especially vehicles formerly being owned by their taxi companies, though some are brought in from Italy or even Belgium. Slovakia Grey import in Slovakia exists in some ways. As part of the EU, importing vehicles from member states is not restricted at all, although imported vehicle has to be inspected for origin (VIN number manipulation, possible stolen vehicle legalization)https://ko.sk/Home.aspx?Menu=id:Uvod Main destinations for import are Germany, Austria, Italy, and the Czech Republic. Imports from non-member EU states are restricted by age. Personal vehicles are restricted to 8 years (from date of first registration to date of customs declaration), and vehicles intended to be used for business are restricted to 5 years. Vehicles imported from non-member states which are not approved for European roads have to pass import inspection, and modified to meet restrictions. For vehicles from the U.S. or Canada it is mandatory to change headlights, or adjust them for the EU bulb pattern, change red rear turn signals to orange ones, separate them from brake wiring, and add fog lights. Importing cars with RHD has been allowed from 20 May 2018, but the headlights and fog lights have to be converted to the continental pattern. Pakistan Grey imports in Pakistan do exist; however, it is limited by passenger cars no older than 3 years old and 4x4 jeeps or off-road passenger vehicles no older than 5 years old at the time of arrival in the Port of Entry. There could be a significant saving on luxury cars in Pakistan, as the official dealer channels may be excessive in price, and also the used car markets may also be excessive in price. The Federal Board of Revenue for Pakistan gives the importer three scenarios which a passenger vehicle could be imported into the country. These scenarios are as follows: *Personal Baggage scheme *Transfer of Residence scheme *Gift scheme The Pakistan Customs Duty rates of imports, providing that the vehicles (excluding jeeps) meet the age requirements for Pakistan, are shown below: *Up to 800 CC (other than US$ 6,600 Asian Makes); *From 801 CC to 1000 CC US$ 5,500 *From 1001 CC to 1300 CC US$ 11,000 *From 1301 CC to 1500 CC US$ 15,400 *From 1501 CC to 1600 CC US$ 18,700 *From 1601 CC to 1800 CC US$ 23,100 In 2018, after years of appealing with the Pakistan Government, the Classic Car Club of Pakistan was delighted to announce that the Pakistan Government has finally allowed the importation of classic vehicles. The Express Tribune of Pakistan reported on the subject by stating; \\"...Earlier in the budget announcement for fiscal year 2018‚Äì19 at the end of April, the government had said that it would impose a flat duty of $5,000 on the import of vintage or classic cars and jeeps.

The duties have been exempted in exercise of the powers of the Customs Act 1969, Federal Excise Act 2005 and Sales Tax Act. However, it clarified that vintage or classic cars and jeeps mean old and used automotive vehicles, falling under PCT Code 87.03 of the First Schedule to the Customs Act 1969 (IV of 1969), manufactured prior to January 1, 1968.

However, they are rare, expensive, and are really limited by small and medium vehicles must be new and not more than 15 days old, buses, vans, and heavy vehicles cannot be more than 25 days old, and vehicles have to be left hand drive before arrival in Greece. Vehicles from LHT countries must be at least 3 years old, have to be converted to left hand drive, and must be inspected before arrival. Cambodia Used cars in Cambodia are mainly imported from Taiwan, USA and the GCC countries (mostly UAE). Used vehicles from Germany and also the Netherlands are rarely imported there due to the lack of port cities and also due to troubled and highly problematic cost of delivery. Singapore As of 2019, the Land Transport Authority mandates that vehicles imported into Singaporean soil must be brand new or manufactured at most three years ago.https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/dam/onemotoring/Buying/PDF/Importation_Guidelines/Car.pdf Armenia Used cars in Armenia are mainly imported from Japan, Singapore and the USA. There are also used cars from European countries, but they are mostly over 15 years old. Kyrgyzstan In Kyrgyzstan, Grey imports of used cars from Japan and the USA are generally most common there. Used cars from European countries are predominantly more than 15 years old, and mostly limited to German car brands. Suriname Grey imports from Japan and Singapore are generally being most common there in Suriname. LHD vehicles are also allowed on the road, but importation of LHD vehicles (especially from the USA) is prohibited. Used vehicles from the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand are rarely imported there. Most of the privately owned buses are imported from Japan, since they are already RHD. Most state-owned buses, however, are from the US and the doors heve to be repositioned. Myanmar In spite of the change to driving on the right, most passenger cars in the country today are RHD, being second-hand vehicles imported from Japan, Thailand, and Singapore. Now, only left hand drive can be imported to Myanmar and the reason behind is that right hand drive cars are unsuitable for Myanmar's road traffic system. Caribbean In many Caribbean islands where traffic drives on the left, such as the British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, most passenger cars are LHD, being imported from the United States or even Korea. Only government cars, buses and vehicles imported from Japan are RHD. The US Virgin Islands (originally a Danish protectorate which drove on the left, as did Denmark until the early 20th century) are particularly notorious for a high accident rate caused by American tourists from the mainland who are unfamiliar with driving on the left in their rental cars ‚Äì the confusion from which is obviously compounded by using a LHD vehicle.

Early years Born at Haltoun House near Ratho, the eldest son and heir of James Maitland, 7th Earl of Lauderdale, whom he succeeded in 1789, he became a controversial Scottish politician and writer. His tutor had been the learned Dr. Andrew Dalzell and James Maitland then attended the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, completing his education in Paris where, it is said, he became radicalised. Parliamentary career Upon his return home in 1780, he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates and successfully stood for election to parliament the same year. From 1780 until 1784 he was a member of parliament representing Newport and from 1784 to 1789, Malmesbury. In the House of Commons he supported the prominent Whig Charles Fox and took an active part in debate and was one of the managers of the Impeachment of Warren Hastings. From 1789, in the House of Lords, where he was a representative peer for Scotland, he was prominent as an opponent of the policy of William Pitt the Younger and the English government with regard to France. He was a frequent speaker and also distinguished himself by his active opposition to the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, the Sedition Bill, and other measures. Upon the outbreak of the French Revolution, of which he was thought to be in sympathy, he ostentatiously appeared in the house in the rough costume of Jacobinism. In July 1792, he fought a bloodless duel with Benedict Arnold after impugning Arnold's honour in the House of Lords. French Revolution In 1792, in the company of John Moore, Lord Lauderdale travelled again to France. The attack on the Tuileries and the imprisonment of King Louis XVI of France, took place three days after the earl's arrival in the French capital. After the massacres of 2 September, the British ambassador having left Paris, the earl left Paris on the 4th for Calais. However, he returned to Paris the following month and did not leave for London until 5 December. Upon his return from France/ he published a Journal during the residence in France from the beginning of August to the middle of December 1792. According to antiquarian Andrew Thomson, \\"James Maitland 8th Earl of Lauderdale was known as 'Citizen Maitland'. An extremist, he was in Paris during the French Revolution and was a personal friend of Jean-Paul Marat. He rarely visited Scotland.\\" The earl had helped to found the British Society of the Friends of the People in 1792. New peerage Upon the formation of the Grenville administration in February 1806, Lauderdale was made a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Lauderdale of Thirlestane and sworn a member of the Privy Council. For a short time from July 1806 he was keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. Napoleonic treaty On 2 August 1806 the earl, fully fluent in French, departed for France, invested with full powers to conclude peace, the negotiations for which had been for several weeks carried on by the Earl of Yarmouth. Arriving on the 5th he and Yarmouth set about the arduous task of treating with Napoleon and Tallyrand. Yarmouth was recalled on the 14th and Lauderdale was left alone. Following the renewal of hostilities he left Paris for London on 9 October. A full account of the progress and termination of the negotiations appeared in the London Gazette of 21 October 1806. After acting as the leader of the Whigs in Scotland, Lauderdale became a Tory and voted against the Reform Bill of 1832. Lord Lauderdale was made a Privy Counsellor in 1806 and a Knight of the Thistle in 1821. Banner dispute In 1672 on the death of the Earl of Dundee, the Duke of Lauderdale was appointed Hereditary Bearer for the Sovereign of the Standard of Scotland, and this right was retained by his heirs until 1910. In 1790, James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale matriculated arms in the character of Hereditary Bearer for the Sovereign of the Standard of Scotland and Hereditary Bearer for the Sovereign of the National Flag of Scotland. In 1952 after a meeting with the Earls of Lauderdale and Dundee the Lord Lyon advised the Queen to confirm the Earl of Lauderdale's right to bear the saltire as the Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland, and to confirm that the Earl of Dundee as the Bearer of the Royal Banner bears the Royal Standard of the lion rampant. Writings Inquiry into the nature and origin of public wealth, 1819 Maitland wrote an Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public Wealth (1804 and 1819), in which he introduced the concept that has come to be known as the \\"Lauderdale Paradox\\": there is an inverse correlation between public wealth and private wealth; an increase in the one can only come at the cost of a decrease in the other. This work, which was translated into French and Italian, produced a controversy between the author and Lord Brougham; The Depreciation of the Paper-currency of Great Britain Proved (1812); and other writings of a similar nature. The \\"Inquiry\\" was the first work to draw attention to the economic consequences of a budget surplus or deficit and its influence on the expansion or contraction of the economy, and was thus the basis of the later Keynesian economic theories which are now widely applied. Death He died at Thirlestane Castle, near Lauder, Berwickshire, at 80. He is buried in the Maitland vault, also called the Lauderdale Aisle, at St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington. Family Angelica Kauffmann He married on 15 August 1782, Eleanor Todd (1762‚Äì1856), only daughter and heiress of Anthony Todd, Secretary of the General Post Office.

While reflecting on a New York City gallery show of Anuszkiewicz's from 2000, New York Times art critic Holland Cotter described Anuszkiewicz's paintings: \\"The drama ‚Äî and that feels like the right word ‚Äî is in the subtle chemistry of complementary colors, which makes the geometry glow as if light were leaking out from behind it.\\" Anuszkiewicz exhibited at the Venice Biennale, Florence Biennale and Documenta, and his works are in permanent collections internationally. He was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1992 as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1994.

Most of his work comprises visual investigations of formal structural and color effects, many of them nested square forms similar to the work of his mentor Josef Albers. In his series, \\"Homage to the Square\\", Albers experimented with juxtapositions of color, and Anuszkiewicz developed these concepts further. Anuszkiewicz continued to produce works in the Op Art style over the subsequent decades of his career. In 1963, Anuszkiewicz summarized his approach to painting as: \\"My work is of an experimental nature and has centered on an investigation into the effects of complementary colors of full intensity when juxtaposed and the optical changes that occur as a result, and a study of the dynamic effect of the whole under changing conditions of light, and the effect of light on color.\\" Selected collections holding works * Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo * Art Institute of Chicago * Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas * Boca Raton Museum of Art * Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh * Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art * Cleveland Museum of Art * Columbus Museum of Art * Denver Art Museum * Detroit Institute of Arts * Flint Institute of Arts * Fogg Museum, Harvard University * The Governor Nelson A.

His small body of published work, which garnered international acclaim, followed in the tradition of Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Albert Roussel and Olivier Messiaen, but in an idiosyncratic style. Some of his notable compositions include a piano sonata, two symphonies, the cello concerto Tout un monde lointain‚Ä¶ (A whole distant world), the violin concerto L'arbre des songes (The tree of dreams), the string quartet Ainsi la nuit (Thus the night) and a sonatine for flute and piano. Some of these are regarded as masterpieces of 20th-century classical music. Works were commissioned from him by such major artists as Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Ren√©e Fleming, and Seiji Ozawa. Writing in the New York Times, Paul Griffiths said: \\"Mr Dutilleux‚Äôs position in French music was proudly solitary. Between Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez in age, he was little affected by either, though he took an interest in their work. ‚Ä¶ But his voice, marked by sensuously handled harmony and color, was his own.\\" Dutilleux was awarded several major prizes throughout his career, notably the Grand Prix de Rome (1938), International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers (1955), the Grand-Croix de la L√©gion d'honneur (2004), the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (2005), the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society (2008) and the Marie-Jos√©e Kravis Prize for New Music (2011). In addition to his activities as a composer, he worked as the Head of Music Production for Radio France for 18 years. He also taught at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris, at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique and was twice composer in residence at the Tanglewood music centre in Lenox and Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Life Henri Dutilleux was born on 22 January 1916 in Angers, Maine-et-Loire. He was the great-grandson of the painter Constant Dutilleux and grandson of the composer Julien Koszul. He was also a cousin of the mathematician Jean-Louis Koszul. As a young man he studied harmony, counterpoint, and piano with Victor Gallois at the Douai Conservatory before leaving for the Conservatoire de Paris. There, between 1933 and 1938, he attended the classes of Jean and No√´l Gallon (harmony and counterpoint, in which he won joint first prize with the cellist Paul Tortelier), Henri B√ºsser (composition) and Maurice Emmanuel (history of music). Dutilleux won the Prix de Rome in 1938 for his cantata L'anneau du roi but did not complete his entire residency in Rome due to the outbreak of World War II. He worked for a year as a medical orderly in the army and then returned to Paris in 1940, where he worked as a pianist, arranger and music teacher. In 1942, he conducted the choir of the Paris Opera. Dutilleux worked as Head of Music Production for Radio France from 1945 to 1963. He served as Professor of Composition at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris from 1961 to 1970. He was appointed to the staff of the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique in 1970 and was composer-in-residence at Tanglewood in 1995 and 1998. His students included the French composers G√©rard Grisey and Francis Bayer, the Canadian composers Alain Gagnon and Jacques H√©tu, the British composer Kenneth Hesketh, and many others. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the 16th composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr√§t of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2006. For many years, Dutilleux had a studio on √éle Saint-Louis, which was the heart of his existence. He died on 22 May 2013 in Paris, aged 97 and was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery, in the same grave as Genevi√®ve, his wife who pre-deceased him in 2009. His tombstone is made from grey granite and bears the epitaph \\"Compositeur\\". Influences and style Dutilleux's music extends the legacies of earlier French composers such as Debussy and Ravel but is also clearly influenced by B√©la Bart√≥k and Igor Stravinsky. Among his favourite pieces, he mentioned Beethoven's late string quartets and Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. His attitude toward serialism was more ambiguous. While he always paid attention to the developments of contemporary music and incorporated some serialist techniques into his own compositions,\\"'Obsessionnel', the third movement of M√©taboles, uses a note row. . . .\\" (Potter 2001); Nichols and Dutilleux 1994, 87. he also criticized the more radical and intolerant aspects of the movement: \\"What I reject is the dogma and the authoritarianism which manifested themselves in that period.\\"Nichols and Dutilleux 1994, 87. As an independent composer, Dutilleux always refused to be associated with any school. Rather, his works merge the traditions of earlier composers and post- World War II innovations and translate them into his own idiosyncratic style. His music also contains distant echoes of jazz as can be heard in the plucked double bass strings at the very beginning of his First Symphony and his frequent use of syncopated rhythms. He often calls for the use of Ray Robinson-style cup mutes by the brass section, which seems to indicate the influence of big band music. Dutilleux was greatly enamoured of vocalists, especially the jazz singer Sarah Vaughan and the great French chanson singers. Some of Dutilleux's trademarks include very refined orchestral textures; complex rhythms; a preference for atonality and modality over tonality; the use of pedal points that serve as atonal pitch centers;\\"This use of pivot chords (or pivot notes) is a constant of Dutilleux's mature style, and provides a point of reference for the listener within an essentially atonal context\\" (Potter 2007, 53). and \\"reverse variation,\\" by which a theme is not exposed immediately but rather revealed gradually, appearing in its complete form only after a few partial, tentative expositions.Potter 2001, also quoted on Ensemble Sospeso website (5th paragraph). BBC Philharmonic website, \\"Latest Concerts from the Manchester Student Music Network\\" Saturday 25 November (undated) (accessed 19 June 2008). Swart ?2007. His music also displays a very strong sense of structure and symmetry. This is particularly obvious from an \\"external\\" point of view, in the overall organisation of the different movements or the spatial distribution of the various instruments, but is also apparent in the music itself (themes, harmonies and rhythms mirroring, complementing or opposing each other). According to Stuart Jefferies, \\"A passage may be conceived as a symmetrical shape of notes on paper and only later given musical substance. He loves symmetrical musical figures such as palindromes or fan-shaped phrases...\\"Jeffries 2005.\\"Dutilleux pousse plus avant encore que Bart√≥k les sym√©tries de tout type, r√©trogrades (par exemple au d√©but du quatuor Ainsi la nuit, 1974‚Äì1976) ou en miroir\\" (Amblard 2007 ). Dutilleux's music was often influenced by art and literature, such as the works of Vincent van Gogh,\\"A great lover of painting, Dutilleux claimed to have van Gogh's La nuit etoilee always in mind when writing Timbres, espace, mouvement, and later added the title of the painting as a subtitle to his work\\" (Potter 2001 ) Charles Baudelaire\\"Baudelaire's poetry inspired the cello concerto Tout un monde lointain...; all five movements feature a Baudelaire epigraph at the head of the score\\" (Potter 2001 ). and Marcel Proust.\\"It is especially the ideas of time and memory, more specifically involuntary memory that the internationally acclaimed French composer Henri Dutilleux finds attractive. Dutilleux often refers to Proust's influence on his music. Furthermore, they both believe in direct experience and communication as the essential function of the work of art\\" (Swart and Spies 2007 ). It also shows a concern for the concepts of time and memory, both in its use of quotations (notably from B√©la Bart√≥k, Benjamin Britten, and Jehan Alain), and in short interludes that recall material used in earlier movements and/or introduce ideas that will be fully developed later. A perfectionist with a strong sense of artistic integrity, he allowed only a small number of his works to be published; what he did publish he often repeatedly revised. In his own words: Compositions Dutilleux numbered as Op. 1 his Piano Sonata (1946‚Äì1948), written for the pianist Genevi√®ve Joy, whom he had married in 1946. He renounced most of the works he composed before it because he did not believe them to be representative of his mature standards, considering many of them to be too derivative to have merit.The Living Composers Project: \\"Henri Dutilleux\\" (accessed 19 June 2008), paragraph 2. After the Piano Sonata, Dutilleux started working on his First Symphony (1951). It consists of four monothematic movements and has a perfectly symmetrical structure: music slowly emerges from silence (first movement‚Äîa passacaglia) and builds towards a fast climax (second‚Äîa scherzo and moto perpetuo), keeps its momentum (third‚Äî\\"a continuous melodic line that never goes back on itself\\"), and finally slowly fades out (fourth‚Äîa theme and variations). In 1953, Dutilleux wrote the music for the ballet Le loup (\\"The Wolf\\"). In his Second Symphony, titled Le double (1959), the orchestra is divided into two groups: a small one at the front with instruments taken from the various sections (brass, woodwind, strings and percussion) and a bigger one at the back consisting of the rest of the orchestra. Although this brings to mind the Baroque concerto grosso, the approach is different: in this piece, the smaller ensemble acts as a mirror or ghost of the bigger one, sometimes playing similar or complementary lines, sometimes contrasting ones.Seen and Heard International: Glyn Pursglove, \\"Concert Review: Dutilleux, Bartok\\", accessed 26 May 2013 His next work, M√©taboles for orchestra (1965) explores the idea of metamorphosis, how a series of subtle and gradual changes can radically transform a structure. A different section of the orchestra dominates each of the first four movements before the fifth brings them all together for the finale. As a result, it can be considered as a concerto for orchestra. It quickly achieved celebrity and, following its premi√®re by George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, was performed in several North American cities, then in France.CIRM ‚Äì Centre National de Cr√©ation Musicale, 2006 \\"Les M√©taboles furent command√©es en 1959 par le chef George Szell √† Henri Dutilleux √† l'occasion du quaranti√®me anniversaire de l'Orchestre de Cleveland, qui en assura la cr√©ation le 14 janvier 1965 sous la direction du commanditaire. L'≈ìuvre connut rapidement la c√©l√©brit√© et fut reprise dans les grandes villes nord-am√©ricaines puis en France.\\" M√©taboles, accessed 26 May 2013 M√©taboles is now one of his most often performed works. In the 1960s, Dutilleux met Mstislav Rostropovich, who commissioned him to write a cello concerto. Rostropovich premi√®red the work, titled Tout un monde lointain‚Ä¶ [A whole distant world], in 1970. It is one of the most important additions to the cello repertoire of the second half of the 20th century\\"The great Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich commissioned Dutilleux to write Tout un monde lointain, now an important work in the cello repertoire.\\" \\"Tout un monde lointain... un des plus beaux concertos pour violoncelle de la seconde moiti√© du XXe si√®cle qui... s'est trouv√© hiss√© au premier rang, celui des concertos de Chostakovitch, Penderecki, Britten...\\" (Peters 2007 ). and is considered one of the composer's major achievements.\\"In the meantime other cellists had Dutilleux's concerto in their repertoire and several other recordings are now available. Tout un monde lointain... is a splendid work and probably one of the composer's finest achievements\\"(Culot 2008). After the cello concerto, Dutilleux turned to chamber music for the first time in more than 20 years and wrote the string quartet Ainsi la nuit (1976). It consists of seven movements, some of which are linked by short \\"parentheses\\". The function of these parentheses is to recall material that has already been heard and to introduce fragments that will be fully developed later.Simon Marin's liner notes (Erato CD 0630-14068-2) It is based on a hexachord (C-G-F-G-C-D) which highlights the intervals of fifth and major second. Each movement emphasizes various special effects (pizzicato, glissandi, harmonics, extreme registers, contrasting dynamics‚Ä¶) resulting in a difficult and elaborate work. He also published various works for piano (3 Pr√©ludes, Figures de r√©sonances) and 3 strophes sur le nom de Sacher (1976‚Äì1982) for solo cello. The latter work was originally composed on the occasion of Paul Sacher's 70th birthday in 1976, on a request by the Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to write compositions for cello solo using his name spelt out in musical notes as the theme eS-A-C-H-E-Re (Es is E in German, H is B in German, and Re is D in French; see Sacher hexachord). He then returned to orchestral works in 1978 with Timbres, espace, mouvement ou la nuit etoil√©e, inspired by Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night. In this composition, Dutilleux attempted to translate into musical terms the opposition between emptiness and movement conveyed by the painting. The work employs a string section of only lower-register instruments: cellos and double basses, no violins or violas. In 1985, Isaac Stern premiered L'arbre des songes [The Tree of Dreams], a violin concerto that he had commissioned Dutilleux to write. Like its cello counterpart, it is an important addition to the instrument's 20th century repertoire. According to the composer, it is based on a process of continual growth and renewal (hence the title): \\"All in all the piece grows somewhat like a tree, for the constant multiplication and renewal of its branches is the lyrical essence of the tree. This symbolic image, as well as the notion of a seasonal cycle, inspired my choice of 'L'arbre des songes' as the title of the piece.\\" Dutilleux later wrote Myst√®re de l'instant (for cymbalum, string orchestra and percussion, 1989), Les Citations (for oboe, harpsichord, double bass and percussion, 1991), The Shadows of Time (for orchestra and children voices, 1997), Slava's Fanfare (for Rostropovich's 70th birthday, 1997) and Sur le m√™me accord (for violin and orchestra, 2002 ‚Äì dedicated to Anne-Sophie Mutter). In 2003, he completed Correspondances, a song-cycle for soprano and orchestra inspired by poems and letters by Prithwindra Mukherjee, Rainer Maria Rilke, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Vincent van Gogh. This work has received a very enthusiastic reception and has been programmed several times since its premi√®re.\\"Correspondances... Je suis heureux que cette ≈ìuvre soit beaucoup jou√©e en ce moment, vingt fois dans le monde!\\" (Costantino 2006 ). His last major work was a song-cycle entitled Le temps l'horloge, written for American soprano Ren√©e Fleming. It consists of four pieces and an instrumental interlude on two poems by Jean Tardieu, one by Robert Desnos and one by Charles Baudelaire. The first three songs were premi√®red at the Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto, Japan in September 2007. The American premi√®re of this partial version took place in November 2007 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.Eichler 2007. Boston.com (30 November 2007). The complete work was unveiled on 7 May 2009 at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es in Paris. In 2010, Dutilleux added a third movement to his chamber work Les citations. The expanded version was premiered at the Festival d‚ÄôAuvers-sur- Oise. In 2011, Pascal Gallois transcribed with Dutilleux's approval three of his early vocal works for bassoon and piano: Regards sur l'Infini (from the early cycle for voice and piano Quatre m√©lodies) and Deux sonnets de Jean Cassou (originally for baritone and piano). He played them in a concert at the H√¥tel de Lauzun in presence of the composer. While Dutilleux allowed only a small number of his works to be published, he actually wrote a lot of music but kept only a small fraction of it.\\"This modest output‚Äîmodest in quantity, though not in quality‚Äîis nonetheless deceptive. His biographer Caroline Potter reports, 'Dutilleux has said that, contrary to what may be assumed by glancing at his catalogue, he actually writes a great deal, but uses only a small percentage of the material. (The Marie-Jos√©e Kravis Prize for New Music at the New York Philharmonic 2011) Dutilleux talked several times about his projects and expressed the wish to write more chamber music,\\"... je voudrais combler les lacunes de mon ≈ìuvre ; ce que je n‚Äôai pas fait ou trop peu. Par exemple, j‚Äôai peu d‚Äôoeuvres de musique de chambre\\" (Costantino 2006 ). notably a second string quartet, a piece for clarinet and ensemble, one for solo double bass as well as some additional piano pr√©ludes.\\"Nor is the cycle meant as a swan song‚Äîthe composer has expressed interest in returning to the string quartet genre\\" () He long considered composing an opera but abandoned that project because he could not find a libretto that appealed to him. Those who commissioned works from Dutilleux included Charles Munch (Symphony No. 2 Le double), George Szell (M√©taboles), Mstislav Rostropovich (Tout un monde lointain‚Ä¶ and Timbres, espace, mouvement), Isaac Stern (L'arbre des songes), Anne-Sophie Mutter (Sur le m√™me accord) and Seiji Ozawa (The Shadows of Time and Le temps l'horloge).

Several major musicians and conductors championed Dutilleux's works notably Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Renee Fleming and Seiji Ozawa. The conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said of his music: \\"His production is rather small but every note has been weighed with golden scales... It's just perfect ‚Äì very haunting, very beautiful. There‚Äôs some kind of sadness in his music which I find very touching and arresting.\\" The critic Tom Service, writing for the BBC, said: \\"Dutilleux's exquisite catalogue of pieces is becoming, rightly, ever more popular with performers and listeners all over the world\\". An obituary in Gramophone commented that \\"Dutilleux represented a generation of musicians with roots almost back into the 19th century; certainly his music can be seen in a direct line from that of his great predecessors Debussy and Ravel.\\"Obituary: Henri Dutilleux ‚Äì composer. gramophone.co.uk (22 January 1916). Roger Nichols, in an obituary in The Guardian, described him as \\"the outstanding French composer between Messiaen and Boulez\\", adding that he \\"achieved a wholly individual synthesis of ear- catching colours and harmonies with formal rigour.\\"Henri Dutilleux obituary  Music. The Guardian (22 January 1916). The Daily Telegraph said: \\"Because Dutilleux was a perfectionist and self-critical to a fault, his output was small. He wrote barely a dozen major works in his career, destroyed much of his early music and often revised what he had written.

In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Du Pont captured San Diego, and was made commander of the California naval blockade. Through the 1850s, he promoted engineering studies at the United States Naval Academy, to enable more mobile and aggressive operations. In the American Civil War, he played a major role in making the Union blockade effective, but was controversially blamed for the failed attack on Charleston, South Carolina in April 1863. Early life and naval career Painting of Du Pont as a midshipman Du Pont was born at Goodstay, his family home at Bergen Point (now Bayonne), New Jersey, the fourth child and second son of Victor Marie du Pont and Gabrielle Jos√©phine de la Fite de Pelleport. His uncle was Eleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont, the founder of E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, which began as a gunpowder factory and today is a multinational chemical corporation. (Samuel was the only member of his generation to use a capital D.)ANB: \\"Samuel Francis Du Pont\\" Du Pont spent his childhood at his father's home, Louviers, across the Brandywine Creek from his uncle's estate and gunpowder factory, Eleutherian Mills, just north of Wilmington, Delaware. He was enrolled at Mount Airy Academy in Germantown, Pennsylvania, at age 9. However, his father was unable to fund his education because of his failing wool mill, and he was encouraged to instead enlist in the U.S. Navy. His family's close connections with President Thomas Jefferson helped secure him an appointment as a midshipman by President James Madison at the age of 12, and he first set sail aboard the 74-gun ship of the line out of Delaware in December 1815. As there was no naval academy at the time, Du Pont learned mathematics and navigation at sea and became an accomplished navigator by the time he took his next assignment aboard the frigate in 1821. He then served aboard the frigate in the West Indies and off the coast of Brazil. Though still not yet a commissioned officer, he was promoted to sailing master during his service aboard the 74-gun in 1825, which sailed on a mission to display American influence and power in the Mediterranean. Soon after his promotion to Lieutenant in 1826, he was ordered aboard the 12-gun schooner , returned home for two years after his father's death in 1827, and then served aboard the 16-gun sloop in 1829. Despite the short period in which he had been an officer by this time, Du Pont had begun to openly criticize many of his senior officers, who he believed were incompetent and had only received their commands through political influence. Sophie Madeleine du Pont, in a photograph by Mathew Brady After returning from the Ontario in June 1833, Du Pont married Sophie Madeleine du Pont (1810‚Äì88), his first cousin as the daughter of his uncle, Eleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont. As he never kept an officer's journal, his voluminous correspondence with Sophie serves as the main documentation of his operations and observations throughout the rest of his naval career. From 1835 until 1838, he was the executive officer of the frigate and the sloop , commanding both the latter and the schooner in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1838 he joined the ship in the Mediterranean until 1841. The following year he was promoted to Commander and set sail for China aboard the brig , but was forced to return home and give up his command because of severe illness. He returned to service in 1845 as commander of the , the flagship of Commodore Robert Stockton, reaching California by way of a cruise of the Hawaiian Islands by the time the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War had begun. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War USS Cyane Taking Possession of San Diego Old Town July 1846, by Carlton T. Chapman (detail) Du Pont was given command of the sloop in 1846 and quickly showed his skill as a naval combat commander, taking or destroying thirty enemy ships and clearing the Gulf of California in the process. Du Pont transported Major John Fremont's troops to San Diego, where they captured the city. Du Pont then continued operations along the Baja coast, including the capture of La Paz, and burnt two enemy gunboats in the harbor of Guaymas under heavy fire. He led the main line of ships that took Mazatl√°n on November 11, 1847, and on February 15, 1848, launched an amphibious assault on San Jos√© del Cabo that managed to strike three miles (5 km) inland and relieve a besieged squadron, despite heavy resistance. He was given command of the California naval blockade in the last months of the war and, after taking part in further land maneuvers, was ordered home. Between wars Du Pont served most of the next decade on shore assignment, and his efforts during this time are credited with helping to modernize the U.S. Navy. He studied the possibilities of steam power, and emphasized engineering and mathematics in the curriculum that he established for the new United States Naval Academy. He was appointed superintendent of the Academy, but resigned after four months because he believed it was a post more appropriate for someone closer to retirement age. He was an advocate for a more mobile and offensive Navy, rather than the harbor defense function that much of it was then relegated to, and worked on revising naval rules and regulations. After being appointed to the board of the United States Lighthouse Service, his recommendations for upgrading the antiquated system were largely adopted by Congress in a lighthouse bill. In 1853, Du Pont was made general superintendent over what is typically considered the first World's Fair in the United States‚Äîthe Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, held in New York City. Despite international praise, low attendance caused the venture to go into heavy debt, and Du Pont resigned. Du Pont became an enthusiastic supporter of naval reform, writing in support of the 1855 congressional act to \\"Promote the Efficiency of the Navy.\\" He was appointed to the Naval Efficiency Board and oversaw the removal of 201 naval officers. When those under fire called upon friends in Congress, Du Pont himself became the subject of heavy criticism, and subsequent review of the dismissals resulted in the reinstatement of nearly half of those removed. The Official Escorts to the Japanese Embassy, 1860: Du Pont, center, with Sidney Smith Lee and David Dixon Porter Du Pont was promoted to captain in 1855. In 1857 he was given command of the steam frigate and ordered to transport William Reed, the U.S. Minister to China, to his post in Beijing. Du Pont's Minnesota was one of seventeen warships parading Western force in China, and after China failed to satisfy demands for greater access to its ports, he witnessed the capture of Chinese forts on the Peiho River by the French and English on April 28, 1858. He then sailed to Japan, India, and Arabia, finally returning to Boston in May 1859. He played a major role in the receiving of the Japanese ambassador that year, accompanying him on his three-month visit to Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia; the trip was a breakthrough for opening Japan to American trade and investment. Du Pont was then made commandant of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in 1860. He expected to retire in this post, but the outbreak of the Civil War returned him to active duty. Civil War When communication was cut off with Washington at the start of the Civil War, Du Pont took the initiative of sending a fleet to the Chesapeake Bay to protect the landing of Union troops at Annapolis, Maryland. In June 1861 he was made president of a board in Washington formed to develop a plan of naval operations against the Confederacy. He was appointed flag officer serving aboard the steam frigate as commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, leading from Norfolk, Virginia the largest fleet ever commanded by an American officer at that time. On November 7, Du Pont led a successful attack on the fortifications at Port Royal harbor in South Carolina. This victory enabled Union naval forces to secure the southern waters of Georgia and the entire eastern coast of Florida, and an effective blockade was established. Du Pont received commendations from U.S. Congress for his brilliant tactical success, and was appointed rear admiral on July 16, 1862. Photograph of Du Pont in 1862 by Frederick Gutekunst Towards the end of 1862, Du Pont became the first U.S. naval officer to be assigned command over armored \\"ironclad\\" ships. Though he commanded them ably in engagements with other ships, they performed poorly in an attack on Fort McAllister, due to their small number of guns and slow rate of fire. Du Pont was then given direct orders from the Navy Department to launch an attack on Charleston, South Carolina which was the site of the first shots fired in the Civil War with the fall of Fort Sumter and the main area in which the Union blockade had been unsuccessful. Though Du Pont believed that Charleston could not be taken without significant land troop support, he nevertheless attacked with nine ironclads on April 7, 1863. Unable to navigate properly in the obstructed channels leading to the harbor, his ships were caught in a blistering crossfire, and he withdrew them before nightfall. Five of his nine ironclads were disabled in the failed attack, and one more subsequently sank. The Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, blamed Du Pont for the highly publicized failure at Charleston. Du Pont himself anguished over it and, despite an engagement in which vessels under his command defeated and captured a Confederate ironclad, was relieved of command on July 5, 1863, at his own request and was replaced in this Office by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren. Though he enlisted the help of Maryland U.S. Representative Henry Winter Davis to get his official report of the incident published by the Navy, an ultimately inconclusive congressional investigation into the failure essentially turned into a trial of whether Du Pont had misused his ships and misled his superiors. Du Pont's attempt to garner the support of President Abraham Lincoln was ignored, and he returned home to Delaware. He returned to Washington to serve briefly on a board reviewing naval promotions. However, subsequent events arguably vindicated Du Pont's judgment and capabilities. A subsequent U.S. naval attack on the city failed, despite being launched with a significantly larger fleet of armored ships. Charleston was finally taken only by the invasion of General Sherman's army in 1865. Death and legacy Coat of Arms of Samuel Francis Du Pont The Dupont Circle Fountain in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. Du Pont died on June 23, 1865, while on a trip to Philadelphia and is buried in the du Pont family cemetery. The cemetery is located near the Hagley Museum in Greenville, Delaware. In 1882, 17 years after Du Pont's death, the U.S. Congress finally moved to recognize his service and commissioned a sculpture of him to be placed in Pacific Circle in Washington. A bronze sculpture of Du Pont by Launt Thompson was dedicated on December 20, 1884, and the traffic circle was renamed Dupont Circle. In attendance were U.S. President Chester A. Arthur and Delaware senator Thomas F. Bayard. Though the circle still bears his name, the statue was moved to Rockford Park (part of Wilmington State Parks) in Wilmington, Delaware, by the du Pont family in 1920, and replaced by a fountain designed by Daniel Chester French, dedicated in 1921. Louviers was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Namesakes Fort du Pont near Delaware City, Delaware, and three U.S. Navy ships; the torpedo boat , and the destroyers and were all named in his honor. Public School 31 in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is named after him, as is Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. Grant Avenue in San Francisco, CA, at one time was named Dupont Street following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848. While it was renamed after President Ulysses S. Grant in 1906, Grant Avenue is still written and said in Chinese as \\"Dupont Gai\\" (ÈÉΩÊùøË°ó, Gai Ë°ó means street). See also * du Pont family * Battle of Fort Pulaski, bombardment.

Operational service In 1946, St. James joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet. On 25 August 1946, while undergoing calibration trials off the Isle of Portland, she accidentally hit and sank the tug Buccaneer with a 4.5-inch shell, while aiming at the target Buccaneer was towing. St. Jamess captain, Commander J. Lee Barber, went alongside and took off Buccaneers crew without loss, but St. James suffered a damaged propeller when the tug capsized. An inquiry was held aboard the cruiser on 28 August, at which it was decided that no further action would be taken. In 1950, St. James deployed on a Home Fleet Spring Cruise, which saw her, as well as many other vessels, including the aircraft carrier and two other carriers, as well as the battleship , visit the Mediterranean, which included stops in Italy. The group performed the usual naval exercises in the region, as well as undertaking 'fly-the-flag' visits to a number of ports.

Types of leashes Nylon webbing leash, a common style Tenterfield Terrier on a long leash at a tracking trial Leashes take many forms; for example: * A simple metal chain. * Long Leash, derived from the Mansfield clan of Collaroy, is a colloquial expression used to define the male of the families unique ability to do what ever they want with no repercussions from their better halves. This aforementioned leash, which is long, has often been referred to as the 'Mansfield Leash'. * Very short tab leashes; a clip attached to a loop handle or to a short piece of leather with a knot or similar short handle. Allows very close, tight control of a dog in certain competition or training situations. * Short, soft, braided leather leash with a loop handle and a clip to attach to the collar, usually about 4 feet in length, commonly used during obedience training. The softness enables the trainer to fold the leash into a shorter length and the braiding allows a firmer grip. * Nylon webbing leash, also known as a tracking/training leash in the UK, usually 4 to 6 feet, with a loop handle and clip, most commonly used for walking dogs casually. * Extended-length webbing leashes, 12 to 30 feet or more, also known as a tracking/training leash in the UK, usually with a loop handle and a clip, primarily for training at a distance or during tracking sessions. * Slip- leash, usually with a loop handle and an adjustable, slipping loop at the other end that goes around the dog's neck. Often used in work or competitions‚Äîsuch as dog agility‚Äîwhere the leash must be quickly removed and replaced. * Retractable, a hook on a thin rope that retracts automatically into a large plastic handle, allowing the dog to wander 15 or 25 feet away while keeping the leash taut (in theory preventing it from tangling around obstacles or the dog's legs) but still allowing the handler to reel in the dog for closer control. There are also bicycle dog leashes, especially designed for people who enjoy taking their pet in a ride with the bike. The leash is an aluminum tube with a plastic coated cable which runs down through the tube. It extends out of the tube end a couple of feet to allow for ease of movement for the dog. One end connects to the bike and the other to the dog's collar. This keeps them safely away the bike. Cat leashes and harnesses are also available on the market and are convenient for people who are not comfortable letting their pet free. Leash laws in the United States Sign near Conneaut Harbor (in Conneaut, Ohio) Many cities have passed legislation that requires dogs to be on leash in public areas; in some areas, cats are also required to be restrained (under control) on a leash, in a kennel, or in a cat-proof yard or house. Purposes of a leash include: preventing animals from frightening or biting people or other animals, defecating and urinating in inappropriate places, endangering traffic, digging up lawns, causing other damage, getting lost, and getting away from owners. Leashes also provide a clear method of communication and ensure control during training of dogs. Cat wearing a harness and leash In the United States, leash laws are different within each state. While some states do not have statewide leash laws and give localities power to make leash law, there are some other states in which leash laws apply statewide. States that do not have statewide leash laws are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. In Connecticut, dogs are not permitted to run at large except in the situation of hunting. Still, if the dog has vicious propensities and the owner still allows it to run at large and a person is bitten, the owner can be fined for up to $1,000 and is also liable for 6 months of prison unless the victim has abused the dog and provoked the harmful behavior. In Delaware, dogs are not allowed to run at large unless in situations when the owner is present and has control over the pet. An exception is for farm dogs. Also, during the night dogs must be kept in an enclosure from which they cannot escape, firmly secured with a collar or chain or other device, so they cannot stray from the premises, or are under the reasonable control of the owner or custodian. If an owner does not respect these laws and if the dog bites someone, the owner is subject to civil liability and for fines of up to $1,500. Dogs in the District of Columbia must be kept on a leash as well. They are also not permitted on school grounds when school is in session or on any public recreation area without a leash. Indiana is one of the states that has a restraint statute, which means that dogs must be restrained at all times. Otherwise, if the dog bites a person when not restrained the owner is subject to civil liability and criminal penalties. Dogs are allowed to run at large during the night in Kentucky only if they are accompanied by and under control of their owner. According to the leash laws of Louisiana, dogs are prohibited to run at large at all times of the day. The same law applies in Maine, where the only exception is for hunting dogs. Missouri legislation requires that dogs are kept in leashes that are no longer than 10 feet when they are in state parks or on historic sites. Also, dogs that have rabies are not permitted to run at large. In Nebraska, dogs may run at large only in counties where the population does not reach 80,000. New Hampshire legislation does not allow dogs to run at large unless they are accompanied by their owner or custodian or when dogs are used for training or are trained for hunting, herding or exhibitions. Illinois legislation prohibits owners from walking their dogs when they are not in a leash. Dogs in New York must be restrained or confined at all times of the day. However, certain NYC parks allow dogs off leash at certain hours. According to the North Carolina law, dogs are allowed to run at large during the night only if they are accompanied by their owner or a person who has received the owner's permission to do so. Ohio law requires one to ‚Äúkeep the dog under the reasonable control of some person,‚Äù but does not require a leash except for ‚Äúany female dog ‚Ä¶ at any time the dog is in heat.‚Äù There are additional provisions for ‚Äúdangerous dogs‚Äù that have injured a person or killed another dog. Pennsylvania legislation states that dogs must be confined or firmly secured or reasonably controlled by a person, within the property of the owner. Tennessee law prohibits dogs to run at large except in cases in which dogs are engaged in legal hunting or herding. West Virginia and Wisconsin are states that do not have a law that requires dogs to be leashed. Still, they do have laws that hold dog owners and keepers liable for all damages caused by dogs that are permitted to run at large. Different law applies to dangerous dogs and female dogs as in different states they are prohibited to run at large at all times. Also, in states such as Connecticut and Louisiana, guide dogs must also be leashed. Dog leashes Dog leashes are used to walk the dog in public places. Having the dog wear a leash is a way of protecting the dog and other persons (e.g., if the dog runs away and bites someone). Also, the length is one of the important aspects of the leash. The length of the leash must be chosen according to the size of the dog and it is important because it allows a good control. Leashes should not be either too long or too short. Too long leashes do not provide good control of the pet which can result in unpleasant accidents with more aggressive dogs whereas too short leashes are uncomfortable for both the dog and the owner. The perfect leash can restrain the dog but at the same time is not viewed as a punishment for the pet. High quality dog leashes have a good quality metal clip and they can be made of leather, nylon or even chain. The metal clip must securely fasten to a metal ring on the collar in order to maintain good control of the dog. The material of which the leash is made of is not of great importance as long as the leash does not show evidence of wear or fraying. Therefore, leashes should be periodically checked to ensure they are maintained in proper condition. An important aspect of dog leashes is their sturdiness. Although rope leashes are quite cheap, they are vulnerable to chewing and fraying and are not amongst the most recommended types of leashes. However, it is considered that a better type of leash is the one made of nylon because this material provides a bit of elasticity which is meant to result in more comfort for the dog. On the other hand, nylon leashes can cause chafe or can cut into the skin of the dog. Leather leashes are often preferred over the nylon ones because of the resistance of the material and because it becomes more flexible with age and it is softer. Leather is however more prone to be chewed when compared to nylon. The retractable dog leash is one of the most dangerous leashes for the dogs because they allow them to go as far as they want. Retractable leashes are usually made of nylon and the retractable device is made of plastic or a stronger composite. Although these leashes can be convenient for both the dog and the owner as it allows some control, they make it difficult to keep a dog under control which can result in persons or other dogs being attacked. Aggressive dogs should not be walked with such a leash, and puppies should be kept closely to ensure their protection from various dangers such as cars. Dogs with a tendency to bolt without warning should be walked with caution, as a retractable lead can allow the dog to accelerate to significant speed before being stopped suddenly presenting the possibility of injury to both dog and owner. Some leashes are made of reflective materials and are suitable for walking the dog at night. They are convenient because they make the dog and the owner much more visible in the traffic, reducing the likelihood of accidents. Cat leashes Cat wearing a harness on a walk Cat leashes are used with the purpose of preventing the cat getting lost. Unlike dogs, cats rarely attack persons on the street, so cat leashes are mainly a safety measure to protect the pet itself. Very often the collars are replaced with harnesses, because they avoid the dangers of collars which include escaping and running away or choking. Cats are more likely to not be willing to be walked in a harness than dogs are, and are considered to need up to months to be able to adjust to wearing a harness. Cat leashes come in a variety of colors, designs and models and are made of different materials. There are cat leashes made of leather, nylon and rope. Whereas the leather leash is one of the best qualities because of the characteristics of the material, it is also one of the most expensive and not very comfortable for the cat at the same time. Nylon cat leashes and harnesses are, however, more elastic, and thus more comfortable and also provide more control. Leashes for large animals Leashes are used on large animals‚Äîsuch as bovids, camelids, and equids‚Äîto lead them so that they will be forced to follow and come to a desired area‚Äîas well as to tether them to a specific area, such as to a fencepost or tree trunk, so that they will remain stationary and not run away. Oftentimes, leashes are used to tether such animals when they require separation, examination, or work to be done to them, such as grooming and tacking up.

Theme Although the novel addresses many societal issues, the primary subject is overpopulation and its relation to culture. Religion, government, and history are also addressed. A significant portion of the book is a condemnation of war. Burgess once said, \\"I have spent the last 25 years thinking that The Wanting Seed could, in my leisurely old age, be expanded to a length worthy of the subject.\\" Plot The novel begins by introducing the two protagonists: Tristram Foxe, a history teacher, and his wife, Beatrice- Joanna, a homemaker. They have recently suffered through their young son's death. Throughout the first portion of the novel, overpopulation is depicted through the limitation and reuse of materials, and extremely cramped living conditions. There is also active discrimination against heterosexuals, homosexuality being encouraged as a measure against overpopulation. Self- sterilization is also encouraged. One of the major conflicts of the novel is between Tristram and his brother, Derek. Very much alike at first, Derek chose a different path from Tristram and pretends to be homosexual while in public, to help his career as a government official. Derek has an affair with Beatrice-Joanna, and when she forgets to take her State-provided contraceptives she becomes illegally pregnant. She has sex with her husband, Tristram, and his brother, Derek, within a 24-hour time span, thus the paternity of her twin boys is uncertain. Life changes as the largely homosexual police ('greyboys') become more repressive, and a mysterious blight spreads across the world threatening food supplies. Tristram is arrested after getting unintentionally mixed up in a protest and spends the next section of the novel in jail. While he is imprisoned, formerly repressed religion begins to bloom, fertility rituals are endorsed, and the structure of society, as well as government, undergoes radical transformation. Cannibalism is openly practised in much of England. Beatrice-Joanna has run away, and is staying with her sister and brother-in-law in the countryside on their farm, where the blight is affecting even their chickens. She stays there until she delivers her twin sons, when members of the Population Police arrives to take her and her children to the city. With the help of his cellmate, Tristram escapes and tries to rejoin his wife. He travels across England to his sister-in-law's farm. He is so desperate for food that he briefly joins \\"a dining club\\", a rather chaotic affair which provides food (composed of murdered human beings) and orgiastic behavior for its village membership. His journey eventually takes him to a sort of soup kitchen, where he enlists in the newly recreated army, which has replaced the (largely eaten) greyboys and Population Police. This is the third section of the novel. In the army, Tristram is shipped to an unknown location to fight in the war, though the reader later discovers that he is in Ireland. In his first battle he discovers that there is no real enemy; the purpose of the \\"war\\" is population control by winnowing out the socially expendable. Companies, led by junior officers trained to recite patriotic verse, are sent to a made-up Western Front style battlefield to kill each other. Every other member of his unit is shot down as they emerge from their trench, but Tristram slips through the barbed wire surrounding the miniature war zone and begins his journey back to England. Escaping back into general society, Tristram finds a new job. In his absence, Beatrice-Joanna has been moved to live with Derek. She has also brought the twins (it is implied that Derek is their father) and named them after her two brotherly lovers, Derek and Tristram Foxe. At the last scene Tristram meets again his wife at Brighton pier. The book closes with a translation of the final stanza of the French poet Paul Val√©ry's poem 'Le Cimeti√®re marin'. The quotation clarifies the book's themes: > The wind rises... we must try to live. The immense air opens and closes my > book. The wave, pulverised, dares to gush and spatter from the rocks. Fly > away, dazzled, blinded pages. Break, waves. Break with joyful waters... Cyclical history Often repeated in the novel is the concept that history is cyclical. As Tristram explains in the first few chapters to his slumbering history class, there are three phases: Pelphase, Interphase, and Gusphase. Pelphase is named after Pelagianism, the theology of Pelagius. The Pelphase is characterised by the belief that people are generally good. Crimes have slight punishment, and the government tries to improve the population. The government works through socialism. According to Tristram \\"A government functioning in its Pelagian phase commits itself to the belief that man is perfectible, that perfection can be achieved by his own efforts, and that the journey towards perfection is along a straight road.\\" The novel begins ‚Äì and ends ‚Äì in Pelphase. Interphase is the darkening of Pelphase into Gusphase ‚Äì an \\"Intermediate\\" phase. As Tristram explains things, the government grows increasingly disappointed in its population's inability to be truly good, and thus police forces are strengthened and the state becomes Totalitarian. In many respects, Interphase is a finite version of George Orwell's 1984. :\\"'Brutality!' cried Tristram. ... 'Beatings-up. Secret police. Torture in brightly lighted cellars. Condemnation without trial. Finger-nails pulled out with pincers. The rack. The cold-water treatment. The gouging out of eyes. The firing squad in the cold dawn. And all this because of disappointment. The Interphase.'\\" Gusphase is named after Augustinianism, the theology of St. Augustine of Hippo. In short, Gusphase involves the lifting of the Interphase. The leaders begin to realise how horrible they have become, and realise that they are being overly harsh. Therefore, the government relaxes its rules and creates havoc. Tristram describes the Gusphase: :\\"The orthodox view presents man as a sinful creature from whom no good at all may be expected... It eventually appears that human social behaviour is rather better than any Augustinian pessimist has any right to expect, and so a sort of optimism begins to emerge. And so Pelagianism is reinstated.\\" Characters *Tristram Foxe ‚Äì a plodding but conscientious history teacher *Beatrice-Joanna Foxe ‚Äì Tristram's unfaithful wife *Derek Foxe ‚Äì Tristram's ambitious and opportunistic brother, becomes head of the Ministry of Infertility *Mr. Livedog ‚Äì the term used for God, who is both good and evil.

He was the brother of Ludwig Philipp Scharwenka (1847‚Äì1917), who was also a composer and teacher of music. Life and career Scharwenka was born in 1850 in Samter, Prussia (Polish: Szamotu≈Çy; until 1793 and since 1919 part of Poland). His paternal ancestors originally came from Prague, then moved to Frankfurt on the Oder in 1696 - probably for reasons of faith - and settled thereafter in Samter.Haus Wieynk - Bad Saarow. Xaver Scharwenka His father, August Wilhelm, was a gifted master- builder but decidedly did not have an ear for music. His mother, n√©e Golisch, was an ethnic Pole from a family of some means, who was musically inclined and early on instilled in her children a love of music. Although he began learning to play the piano by ear when he was 3, Scharwenka did not start formal music studies until he was 15, when his family moved to Berlin and he enrolled at the Akademie der Tonkunst. Under Theodor Kullak, his pianistic skills developed rapidly, and he made his debut at the Singakademie in 1869. He taught at the academy until entering military service in 1873. Upon his discharge in 1874, Scharwenka began touring as a concert pianist. Praised for the beauty of his tone, he became a renowned interpreter of the music of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin.Suttoni, New Grove (2001), 22:339. In 1881 Scharwenka organized a successful annual series of chamber and solo concerts at the Singakademie in conjunction with Gustav Holl√§nder and Heinrich Gr√ºnfeld. That October he founded his own music school in Berlin. In 1886, he conducted the first in a series of orchestral concerts devoted to the music of Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and Ludwig van Beethoven while continuing to tour extensively and play his works in collaboration with other artists such as the conductor Hans Richter and the violinist Joseph Joachim. This triple role as pianist, composer and educator would occupy Scharwenka for the rest of his career.Suttoni, New Grove (2001), 22:439‚Äì440. In 1891, Scharwenka made his first tour of America. Deciding to emigrate, he opened a New York branch of his Scharwenka Music School. In 1893 the Berlin Scharwenka Conservatory was united with the Klindworth Conservatory, and in 1898 he returned there as Director, from New York. In 1914, with W. Petzet, he opened a School of Music with a piano teachers' seminary attached.A. Eaglefield-Hull, Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London 1924). Among pianists who received some instruction from him were Jos√© Vianna da Motta, Fridtjof Backer-Gr√∏ndahl and Selmar Janson. His Methodik des Klavierspiels was published in Leipzig in 1907.Suttoni, New Grove (2001), 22:440. Sometime in the very early 1900s he conducted Felix Mendelssohn's G minor Concerto, at which the composer and pianist Marthe Servine made her debut.The Roth String Quartet in a Program of Compositions by Marthe Servine. Program for concert at Town Hall, New York, NY, Feb. 9, 1941. Scharwenka made several recordings for Columbia Records in 1910 and 1913, including works of his own, as well as pieces by Chopin, Mendelssohn, Weber and Liszt:Methuen-Campbell, James: Catalogue of recordings by classical players, Vol. 1 (1984) his account of Chopin's Fantaisie- Impromptu (Op. posth. 66) is admired. His playing is also preserved on Welte- Mignon and Hupfeld piano rolls, including the Chopin A-flat Waltz, Op 42, and the F minor Fantaisie (Op. 49), his performance of which was famous.J. Methuen-Campbell, Chopin Playing from the Composer to the Present Day (Gollancz, London 1981), 101-2. Some of his Hupfeld rolls were also converted for the American Ampico reproducing piano. He died in Berlin, Germany, in 1924. Music Portrait by Anton von Werner Scharwenka's own compositions include an opera (Mataswintha), a symphony, four piano concertos, chamber music (all with piano part) and numerous piano pieces; his piano idiom somewhat resembles Schumann and Rachmaninoff. The four piano concertos are substantial works. The first, in B-flat minor, Op. 32,Referred to as \\"Scharwenka's B-flat-minor horror\\" by Glenn Gould in: Tim Page (ed.), The Glenn Gould Reader (Knopf, New York 1984), 74. was completed in 1874 and premiered the following year. It was originally written as a solo piano fantasy, but Scharwenka was dissatisfied, and reworked it with orchestra into this form. Franz Liszt accepted the dedication and performed it in Berlin.Frank Cooper, 1970 Sleevenote to RCA SB 6815. Its first recording was made in 1968 with Earl Wild and the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Erich Leinsdorf. Wild had learned the concerto as a boy under Selmar Janson, who had studied it directly with the composer. When Leinsdorf asked Wild to record the concerto, he was able to say \\"I've been waiting by the phone for forty years for someone to ask me to play this\\".Debora Arder, The Piano Teaching of Earl Wild The fourth concerto, in F minor, Op. 82 (1908), was premiered on 18 October 1908 in the Beethovensaal, Berlin, with Scharwenka's student Martha Siebold as the soloist and the composer himself conducting. Scharwenka's works were neglected for some years after his death; however, his \\"Polish Dance No. 1\\" in E-flat minor, Op. 3, No. 1, remained enormously popular. Since the mid-1990s, however, interest in his music has been rekindled, and recordings of most of his works are now commercially available. The recording of his Fourth Piano Concerto played by Stephen Hough with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster was voted Record of the Year by the British music magazine Gramophone in 1996. His Symphony in C minor, Op. 60, received its CD premiere in 2004.

A former U.S. champion and Olympic medalist, Westbrook's career began when his Japanese mother convinced him to try fencing. He founded the Peter Westbrook Foundation (PWF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit, that uses fencing as a vehicle in developing life and academic skills for young people from underserved communities of New York City. Biography Westbrook's father, Ulysses, was a G.I. stationed in Japan during the Korean War, when he met Mariko, a Japanese woman from a sheltered home. Soon after their marriage they returned to the United States, traveling first to St. Louis, Missouri and eventually settling in Newark, New Jersey, where Peter and his younger sister Vivian were born. Peter's earliest memories are of frequent bouts of domestic violence. Peter was 4 when his father left, leaving his mother to raise the family with no real skills or outside means of support. Through a series of jobs, working in a factory and as a maid, she provided for her children. Mariko bartered with priests at the local Catholic school (St. Peters/Queen of Angels) in exchange for schooling for Peter and Vivian. Harassed by the other children because of his mixed race and taught by his mother to \\"not cry, to work hard, to be ethical, and to fight to achieve our goals; And if we should survive the fight, she said, we should get up and fight some more,\\" the young Westbrook became a very good fighter. His fencing career started at fencing powerhouse Essex Catholic High School, only because of his mother's $5.00 bribe. Mariko knew that fencing would keep Peter out of trouble and, if he had any ability, bring him into contact with people who would expose him to a different world that the one he had been born into. Early fencing career Under the tutelage of Dr. Samuel D'ambola, a medical doctor and the founder of the Essex Catholic High School fencing program, Peter's talent was discovered and nurtured. In this supportive environment, despite experiencing some incidents of racism, he excelled. Recognizing his innate abilities, Dr. D'ambola started Peter with the sabre; a military sword with a distinctive look. Used predominantly as a cutting and slashing weapon, Peter was thrilled to be training on a sword that childhood hero Zorro had also used. > I quickly became attached to sabre fencing ... [it] satisfied my constant > need to be quick with everything I did. Fencing was just like street boxing, > only not as brutal. And here was a kind of fighting that my mother not only > allowed, but actually encouraged.\\" [Harnessing Anger, pg 33] Thanks to a rigorous training program from 3:00 to 6:00 pm every day after school, young Peter was kept off the street and out of trouble. His skill and talent were rewarded with numerous wins and by his senior year he was the best fencer for a high school team that rarely lost a match. College Peter didn't consider college until he received a recruitment call from New York University's Hugo Castello, the multi-championship-winning fencing coach for one of the best fencing programs in the country. Under the tutelage of coaching greats like Hugo and James Castello, Peter's abilities entered a new level of greatness. In addition to talented coaching, he would regularly spar with teammates like Steve Kaplan. \\"NYU was like a tributary that lead out into the great ocean‚Äîyou could get there from here.\\" [Harnessing Anger, page 41] While at NYU Peter switched from the School of Education to the School of Business, falsely believing that working in an office would be easier than teaching having to \\"stand in front of a bunch of people and look them in the eyes and convey a message!\\" [Harnessing Anger, page 42] Westbrook credits therapist Mildred Klingman with helping him lose his fears and inhibitions and teaching him how to \\"read\\" people and communicate with them. In 1972 he began training with Csaba Elthes, a Hungarian sabreur at the New York Fencers Club with a reputation as the best fencing coach in America. Physically and verbally abusive behavior led Peter to leave Csaba after one semester. In 1973, Peter won the NCAA championship, claiming the title Best college sabreur in the country. Recognizing that his short time with Csaba has advanced his skill significantly, Peter returned to Csaba, who also realized that Peter, unlike other fencers, didn't require abuse in order to focus and learn because he was a very good listener. In 1974 as a college senior, Peter placed first at the Amateur Fencers League of America's (now known as USA Fencing) National Championships, beating world-class fencers like Alex Orban and Paul Apostol and securing the title of America's Best Sabreur. National championships Westbrook won the U.S. National Men's Sabre Championship 13 times (1974‚Äì'75, '79‚Äì'86, '88‚Äì'89 and '95). Winning the Nationals made him an internationally recognized fencer because of the caliber of the competitors. For Peter, the thirteen wins are his \\"lucky thirteen\\". Pan American Games In 1975, Westbrook won a silver team medal and a bronze individual medal at the Pan American Games in Mexico City. In 1979, he won a silver team medal. These wins were soon accompanied by his 1983 gold individual medal and silver team medal. From 1987 to 1995, Westbrook won an additional silver medals for individual performance (1987); two silver medals for team performance (1987, 1991) and gold medals for individual and team performances (1995). Olympics In 1976, Westbrook attended his first Olympic games. During pre-competition sparring with another European fencer, Peter tore two ligaments. While other athletes might view this incident as damaging, Peter optimistically saw it as an opportunity to do his best without feeling pressures that comes with being a rising star. He ended the competition ranked 13th among the world's best sabre fencers. The many highlights of his Olympic team career include membership on five Olympic teams and being chosen as flag bearer for the closing ceremonies of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. This honor is conferred by a vote by that year's Olympians. His greatest moments came when he won a bronze medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Peter describes the match in his book Harnessing Anger this way: > When I walked onto the strip in Los Angeles for my final match against the > Frenchman Herve Grang√©r-Vernon, my adrenaline is pumping ... As the match > begins, I get the first touch. I get the second touch. I make it to four, My > touches appear to me to be so skillful, so beautiful, that I say to myself, > 'I think I'm in the Zone, but I'm not sure. Let me not think about it. ... > '. Soon enough, as soon as the thought crosses my mind, the Frenchman gets > two points on me. But I snatch the game right back. I get another touch and > it's 8-2. Then he gets 8-3, and 8-4. Even as he is gaining, I know the game > is mine. All I gotta do is keep riding the tide, keep going with it. I get > 9-4, and I finish him off 10-4. The Frenchman falls to his knees crying. > When I looked out at the crowd, I could see that the Hungarians, the > Italians, and the rest of the Europeans had all turned around. They went > from not wanting my win to happen, to being forced to say in their hearts > and souls, 'Bravo. Bravo'. That, to me, was incredible. Peter Westbrook Foundation 2004 Fencing Olympians from Peter Westbrook Foundation, Keeth Smart, Erinn Smart, Ivan Lee, and Kamara James (l-r) In 1987, at the suggestion of Peter's friend, Tom Shepard, fencing clinics for inner-city kids were offered. The Peter Westbrook Foundation (PWF) was officially launched on a cold Saturday morning in February 1991 at the New York Fencers Club, which was located on West 71st Street in Manhattan. The first official class for the PWF Saturday Fencing Program consisted of six kids, \\"all of them our own relatives or those of our friends.\\" Within two years the program grew to 40 youth, then 100. In the 2009/2010 school year, the PWF served over 400 youth from the underserved communities across New York City. The Peter Westbrook Foundation is a 501(c)(3), non-operating foundation that is dedicated to utilizing the sport of fencing as a vehicle to develop life skills in young people from underserved communities. With a specific focus on engaging New York City's low and moderate-income youth, PWF teaches young people good sportsmanship in addition to developing their critical thinking skills, strengthening their self-confidence, encouraging the maintenance of an active and healthy lifestyle and supporting academic achievement. The Foundation has evolved from solely providing introductory fencing classes to offering academic enrichment and advanced fencing instruction for youth who demonstrate exceptional talent for the sport. The program's staff has included world-class coaches (Csaba Elthes, Boris Lieberman, Rotchild Magloire, Yuri Gelman, Max Catala, and Aladar Kogler) medalists and Olympians (Michael Lofton, Robert Cottingham, Herb Raynaud, Eric Rosenberg, Lazarro Mora, and Donald Anthony) and PWF students Ahki Spencer-el, Keeth Smart and his sister Erinn Smart, Kamara James, Ivan Lee, Benjamin Bratton, Nzingha Prescod, and Epiphany Georges. The PWF Elite Athlete Program In 2000 the Peter Westbrook Foundation was represented on the international stage for the first time when Ahki Spencer-el, Keeth Smart, and his sister Erinn Smart qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. In 2004 four of his students, Keeth Smart, Kamara James, Ivan Lee, and Erinn Smart represented the United States in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Ivan Lee won the 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008 sabre national championships, Keeth Smart won the 2004 and 2002 national championship titles and was ranked # 1 in the world in 2003 (the first-ever American to hold this rank). Erinn Smart won the 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, and 2008 women's foil national championships, and Kamara James was ranked # 1 in the world in women's √©p√©e in 2004. In 2008, the Peter Westbrook Foundation reached unprecedented levels of success when the brother-sister duo, and lifelong PWF members Keeth Smart and Erinn Smart represented the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, and both returned home with silver medals. These medals would not only symbolize the individual victories of Keeth and Erinn but reaffirm the Peter Westbrook Foundation in its mission and ideals. Other notable fencers trained by the Peter Westbrook Foundation Keeth Smart, Ivan Lee, Erinn Smart, Kamara James, Akhi Spencer- El, Benjamin Bratton, Dwight Smith, Donovan Holtz, Rashaan Greenhouse, Adam Rodney, Harvey Miller III, Herby Raynaud, Dwayne Smith, Ras Davidson, Marty Williams, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Torian Brown, Epiphany Georges, Nzingha Prescod, Carrington Harris, Adam Crompton, Andre Crompton, Ahmed Yilla, Daniel Bak, Adrian Bak, and Curtis McDowald. The PWF Academic Enrichment Program The Academic Enrichment Program (AEP) provides one-on-one tutorial support, literacy assistance, SAT, PSAT, and specialized high school exam preparation, along with group workshops and productivity seminars on core academic skills, time management, and motivational techniques and the development of effective homework habits. From October through June, students and tutors meet for 6 to 12 hours each month at a PWF center in either Chelsea or Harlem, where they receive extra academic support that will improve their understanding and performance in academic areas they find challenging. Writing In 1997, Westbrook published his memoirs, Harnessing Anger: The Way of an American Fencer in which he describes turning his childhood experiences into a drive to succeed at his sport and the inception of the Peter Westbrook Foundation. In Harnessing Anger, Westbrook tells how he came to be the first African American to win a national gold title in sabre fencing along with reaching international levels of success. Westbrook describes how as the son of an African-American father and a Japanese mother, Peter was aided by his mother alone in poverty in a Newark ghetto. Becoming a fencer at an early age gave him the confidence and the discipline to use an ancient martial art to his advantage both in swordplay and when facing the vicissitudes of daily life in the inner city. The autobiography of this 6-time Olympian, 13-time U.S. National champion is the only book on his amazing life. Harnessing Anger tells us how Westbrook has overcome strong adversaries on and off the fencing strip. 'Harnessing Anger: The Way of an American Fencer' (1997), was nominated by the American Library Association for the Book of the Year Award.

Ely Lake Campground is on Ely Lake, a small inland lake.Allegan Parks Dept : Ely Lake Campground Silver Creek Campground is owned and operated by Allegan County. They both have picnic tables and fire pits at each campsite and vault toilets and water pump stations. Ely Lake, a non-motorized boat lake has a swimming beach and Silver Creek has a shallow spring-fed creek. They both welcome tent and hammock camping, as they are located in a heavily forested area. There are camping fees and reservations can be made. Silver Creek Campground also has a pavilion for day use with picnic tables and fire pits. Silver Creek Campground is in a good location for road biking as all the roads leading to Silver Creek are paved country roads, even though within the campground the roads are dirt. The forest is a mixture, but largely hardwood. The Kalamazoo River flows through the northern portion. It is popular with canoeists and fisherman. Behind the Calkins Bridge Dam the Kalamazoo becomes the large, but shallow, Lake Allegan. Geography During hunting season, many come to hunt whitetail deer, Canada geese and wild turkeys. Trails are laid out for hikers and horse riders in the summer and snowmobilers and cross-country skiers in the winter. The forest is broken up by private ownership with sections of woods and sections of homes.

He was born in Krotoschin and died in Berlin. Note: archive url is available but has very poor formatting: archive date: 16 October 2012 Background Kullak was born in Krotoschin (Krotoszyn) in the Grand Duchy of Posen. He began his piano studies as a pupil of Albrecht Agthe in Posen (Pozna≈Ñ). He progressed sufficiently to excite the interest of the artistic Prince Anton Radziwill in his eighth year. This early ability to attract noble patronage was an art he continued to deploy to advantage for many years to come. In 1829 the prince used his influence to secure a Berlin court concert. He appeared with a soprano singer named Henriette Sontag. The usually undemonstrative King Frederick William IV was so delighted that he presented young Kullak with thirty Friedrichs d'or. Six weeks in Berlin was a real adventure which was topped off with a concert in Breslau that was received with gratifying applause. The kindly Prince Radziwill then saw to a rounded education for Kullak, sponsoring his school fees in Sulech√≥w (now in Poland). Kullak eventually lost Radziwill's patronage and from the age of thirteen to eighteen had to make do with just occasional access to a piano. At age nineteen, at his father's behest, he opted for a sensible profession and went to study medicine in Berlin. A new aristocratic friend, Ingenheim, provided a small stipend which allowed him music studies with Siegfried Dehn and E. E. Taubert. Ingenheim was also instrumental in providing him with several pupils of rank. Medicine was not close to Kullak's heart. Music was a more pressing vocation and in 1842 a Frau von Massows interceded on his behalf in the right places, and Frederick William IV placed 400 thaler at Kullak's disposal, specifically for piano studies. Musical career The 24-year-old opted for a Viennese education. Carl Czerny happily took over his pianistic schooling, and Otto Nicolai and Simon Sechter, the theoretical side of things. Franz Liszt and Adolf von Henselt were also highly revered influences. Kullak played a little in Austria that year but in 1843 returned to Berlin where Fraulein von Hellwig secured him the post of pianoforte instructor to Princess Anna, the daughter of Prince Karl. This was just the beginning. Kullak seemed subsequently to make a speciality of teaching princes and princesses of the Royal house, as well as the offspring of many upper-class families who became aware of his excellent professorial qualifications, connections and, presumably, his unimpeachable manners. In 1844 Kullak founded the Tonk√ºnstler- Verein in Berlin and presided over it for many years. Two years later, at the age of twenty-eight, he was made Pianist to the Prussian Court, and four years after that founded the Berliner Musikschule (also known as the Kullak Institute) in partnership with Julius Stern and Adolf Bernhard Marx. However, due to dissension in the ensuing five years, Kullak retired from his institute, which then became known as the Stern Conservatory, with Hans von B√ºlow as a director. In 1855 Kullak established a new school, the Neue Akademie der Tonkunst, which proved a lasting success and was affectionately referred to as \\"Kullak's Academy.\\" It specialised in the training of pianists and became the largest private music school in the whole of Germany. By the time of its twenty-fifth anniversary it boasted a hundred teachers and eleven hundred students. Kullak was made Professor in 1861 and was also elected to honorary membership of the Royal Academy of Music in Florence. Many other distinctions were also accorded him. His son Franz (1844‚Äì1913) received his musical education at his father's Academy, and completed his studies under Karl Wehle and Henry Litolff in Paris, but abandoned a concert career because of a nervous complaint, and instead taught at the Neue Akademie where he succeeded his father as director upon his father's death in 1882. Kullak wrote a large amount of instructional piano music. His Die Schule des Oktavenspiels (The School of Octave Playing), published in 1848 and edited in 1877, is especially well known. His other music, including a piano concerto in C minor, and two sonatas, is very rarely played today. Theodor Kullak edited and annotated a 13-book edition of the piano works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin that was published by Schlesinger and co-issued by G. Schirmer Inc. and others in the 1880s. (The complete edition is available on IMSLP.) He also edited the complete piano works of Felix Mendelssohn, including Songs Without Words, published by C. F. Peters. Among Kullak's many pupils were August Arnold, Alfred Gr√ºnfeld, Heinrich Hofmann, Alexander Ilyinsky, Moritz Moszkowski, Silas Gamaliel Pratt, Julius Reubke, Nikolai Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka, Otto Bendix, Hans Bischoff, Amy Fay, James Kwast and Fred Werner . Noted Bohemian pianist and composer Franz Bendel taught at the academy.

Life and work He was born in Paris, son of a wealthy merchant, jeweller of the Place Dauphine, and followed his father's business. In 1664, he started for the East Indies with M. Raisin, a Lyons merchant. They journeyed by Constantinople and the Black Sea, reaching Persia early in 1666. The same year the shah, Abbas II, made Chardin his agent for the purchase of jewels. In the middle of 1667, he visited India and returned to Persia in 1669. The next year he arrived in Paris. He issued an account of some events to which he was an eyewitness in Persia, entitled 'Le Couronnement de Soleiman Troisi√®me,' Paris, 1671. A learned nobleman, Mirza Sefi, a prisoner in his own palace at Isfahan, had entertained him, instructed him in the Persian language, and assisted him in this work. Peter de la Croix and Tavernier severely criticised it, while Ange de la Brosse as strongly defended it. Chardin again started for the East, August 1671. He was at Constantinople from March to July 1672. A quarrel between the grand vizier and the French ambassador made the position of French subjects dangerous, and Chardin escaped in a small vessel across the Black Sea, and made a most adventurous journey by Caffa, and through Georgia, and Armenia to Ispahan, which he reached in 1673. At Sapias, he was robbed by the Mingrelians of all he possessed except two small bundles, worth ¬£6,000. He stayed at Ispahan four years, following the court in all its removals, and making particular journeys throughout the land, from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf and the river Indus, and visiting several Indian cities. By these two journeys he realised a considerable fortune, and, deciding to return home, reached Europe in 1677 by a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope. Frontiscipe of Voyage du Chevalier Chardin en Perse et autres lieux de l'Orient, 1739. Cuneiform inscriptions recorded by Jean Chardin in Persepolis in 1674 (1711 edition) Of four volumes originally projected the first volume was published in 1686, Journal du Voyage . . . de Chardin en Parse et aux Indes Orientales, London, fol. An English translation was issued concurrently. This volume contains the author's journey from Paris to Ispahan, and has the author's half-length portrait by Loggan, with eighteen copper plates, mostly folding. His former work is reprinted there with a fulsome 'Epistle Dedicatory to James II.' Chardin in his preface announced three other volumes to follow. The last, which was to contain a short history of Persia, along with his diaries for 1675‚Äì77, never appeared. The other three volumes (with many additions to the first) were published at Amsterdam, 1711, 4to, Voyages de Mons. le Chevalier Chardin, as the complete work. In 1711 another edition, with his translation of La Relation des Mingreliens, by J. M, Zampi, appeared in ten vols., Amsterdam, l2mo; and in 1735 another edition was published in four vols. 4to, containing a great number of passages added from his manuscripts, but with many omissions of violent Calvinistic passages. The most complete reprint is that of M. L. Langles, in ten vols. 8vo, Paris, 1811. Chardin's style of writing is simple and graphic, and he gives a faithful account of what he saw and heard. Montesquieu, Rousseau, Gibbon, and Helvetius acknowledge the value of his writings; and Sir William Jones says he gave the best account of Mahometan nations ever published. Extracts from his works appear in all the chief collections of travels, but there is no complete English translation. In 1681, Chardin determined to settle in England because of the persecution of Protestants in France. He was well received at court, and was soon after appointed court jeweller. He was knighted by Charles II at Whitehall, 17 November 1681. The same day he married a Protestant lady, Esther, daughter of M. de Lardini√®re Peign√©, councillor in the Parliament of Rouen, then a refugee in London. He carried on a considerable trade in jewels, and in the correspondence of his time was called 'the flower of merchants.' In 1682, when he lived in Holland House, Kensington, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1684, the king sent him as envoy to Holland, where he stayed some years, was styled agent to the East India Company. On his return to London he devoted most of his time to oriental studies. In the prefaces to his works, 1686 and 1711, besides travels he speaks of what he calls 'my favourite desipi,' or 'Notes upon Passages of to the Holy Scriptures, illustrated by Eastern ally Customs and Manners,' as having occupied his time for many years. He did not live after to publish it, and after his death the manuscript was supposed to be lost. Some of his descendants advertised a reward of twenty guineas for it. When Thomas Harmer published a second edition of his, 'Observations on divers pissages of Scripture,' 2 vols., London, 1776, 8vo, it was found that by the help of Sir Philip Musgrave, a descendant of Chardin, he had recovered the lost manuscript in six small volumes, and had incorporated almost all of them in his work, under the author's name, or signed 'MS. C.,' i.e. manuscript of Chardin. In his latter years Chardin lived at Turnin. Sir John died in Chiswick, London in 1713. He was buried in Turnham Green (Chiswick). A funeral monument to Chardin exists in Westminster Abbey, bearing the inscription Sir John Chardin ‚Äì nomen sibi fecit eundo (\\"he made a name for himself by travelling\\"). The remains of Chardin's library were sold by James Levy at Tom's coffee-house, St. Martin's Lane, 1712‚Äì13. Family He had four sons and three daughters. His eldest son, John, was created a baronet 1720 and died unmarried. He had three others, Daniel, Charles and George. He left his large Kempton Manor House and estate, Sunbury on Thames to his nephew Sir Philip Chardin Musgrave. Value of Chardin's work 1988 Dover edition of Chardin's Travels Modern scholars consider the 1711 edition of Voyages (edited by the Orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langl√®s) to be the standard version. The complete book has never been translated into English; in fact, English- language versions contain less than half of the original material. Early readers commended Chardin's work for its fullness and fidelity, and he received praise from a number of Enlightenment thinkers, among them Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire and Gibbon. Latter-day scholars of Persia also vouch for his importance; according to John Emerson, \\"his information on Safavid Persia outranks that of all other Western writers in range, depth, accuracy, and judiciousness.\\" Chardin travelled far and wide, had a good command of the Persian language, and left detailed accounts of the places and people he encountered. He also had direct access to the Safavid court, and his descriptions of contemporary politics and administration are highly regarded. Although there are occasional lapses in his books, he is generally trusted as a reliable witness, and his work has been used as a source for diverse studies on Safavid history, government, economics, anthropology, religion, art and culture.

Career Takahashi started as a manga artist in 1982. His first work was Toki≈ç no Tsuma (ÈóòËºùÁéã„ÅÆÈ∑π), published in 1990. One of his earliest works, Tennenshoku Danji Buray (Â§©ÁÑ∂Ëâ≤Áî∑ÂÖêBURAY), was published from 1991 to 1992 and lasted two volumes. Takahashi did not find success until 1996, when he created Yu-Gi-Oh! Takahashi's Yu-Gi-Oh! manga led to the creation of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game published by Konami. Originally intended as a one-shot in the manga's episodic introduction of new games, the game was named \\"Magic and Wizards\\" as a reference to the card game Magic: The Gathering and its publishing company Wizards of the Coast (the card game's name was changed to \\"Duel Monsters\\" in the anime adaptations). However, Shueisha, the publisher of the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine, received so many letters and fan-mail asking about \\"Magic and Wizards\\" that Takahashi decided to extend it. Takahashi has continued to supervise the creation of Yu-Gi-Oh! manga since the end of the original manga's run. In 2013, the one shot manga Drump was released in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, based on a new game by Kazuki Takahashi. In 2015, the manga artist received the Inkpot award from Comic-Con International for his outstanding contributions in the comics. In 2018, Takahashi published the limited series The Comiq in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Artist exchanges Takahashi collaborated with Yoshio Sawai by drawing a picture of Dark Yugi for Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, where he pops out of Bobobo's afro at one point. In return, Takahashi included the nu handkerchief in a panel of the thirty-fourth volume of Yu-Gi- Oh!. Takahashi and Mike Mignola, the creator of Hellboy, also participated in an art exchange (with Takahashi drawing Hellboy with Yugi Mutou's hairdo, a Millennium Puzzle, and a duel disk and Mignola drawing Hellboy wearing a Millennium Puzzle and a Yugi T-shirt).\\"When Yugi Met Hellboy...\\" Shonen Jump.

In an interview with Shonen Jump, Takahashi stated that his favorite manga from other authors included Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki, and Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama.

The central character of the series, Sam, a former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox baseball team, is the owner and bartender of the bar called \\"Cheers\\". He is also a recovering alcoholic and a notorious womanizer. Although his celebrity status was short-lived, Sam retains that standing within the confines of Cheers, where he is beloved by the regular patrons. Along with Carla Tortelli and Norm Peterson, he is one of only three characters to appear in all episodes of Cheers. Sam has an on-again, off-again relationship with the bar waitress Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) for the series' first five seasons until her departure from the series. Then he tries to seduce Diane's replacement, Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley), who frequently rejects his advances. Sam also appears in \\"The Show Where Sam Shows Up\\", a crossover episode of the spin-off Frasier. Other actors auditioned for the role. Producers decided to give Danson the role for primarily his scenes with Shelley Long as Diane. Critical reception for the character has been mostly positive. Some academics considered Sam an example of satirizing masculinity. For his performance as Sam, Ted Danson won two respective Emmy Awards as an Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1990 and 1993 and two Golden Globe Awards as a Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Series. Role At the time the series debuted in 1982, Sam has been the bartender and owner of Cheers for five years.\\"Give Me a Ring Sometime.\\" Cheers: Season 1: The Complete First Season on DVD.

Cheers: Season 3: The Complete Third Season on DVD. Paramount, 2004. DVD. Sam began his career in the minor leagues, where he met Coach Ernie Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto). He eventually became a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, wearing number 16. His major league career lasted approximately five years; he specifically mentions having pitched in 1973, and was a member of the 1975 AL champion Red Sox team. As well, Martin Crane saw him pitch at the Kingdome, which opened in 1977 ‚Äì also the year that he became the owner of Cheers. Although his baseball career is not highly detailed throughout the series, Sam was at times a good-to-very- good pitcher (stories of him retiring star batters occur during the series), and was the team's bullpen ace for a while. Sam's baseball career declined when he became an alcoholic, and there are also numerous stories of him pitching poorly and giving up tape-measure home runs. Over time, Sam's role as a bartender turns him into the \\"resident ringleader for an assortment of poor souls and wanna-be's\\".Davis, Walter T., Jr., et al.

Throughout the series, Sam has had casual female partners, usually one-dimensional or sexually very available, and sometimes takes them along in his red Chevrolet Corvette. However, in \\"Sam Turns the Other Cheek\\" (episode 49, 1984), Sam reveals that he avoids \\"married, underage, and comatose\\" women, so he does have some ethical standards. In \\"Teacher's Pet\\" (season 3, 1985), Sam earns his high school diploma despite an overall bad grade from the high school geography teacher, with whom he had a brief affair while he was her student. The episode \\"Sam's Women\\" (episode 2, 1982) reveals that Sam was married to his somewhat more sophisticated ex-wife, Debra (Donna McKechnie). (In some syndicated prints, Sam's past marriage is omitted, although it is mentioned again in the 5th-season episode, \\"Young Dr. Weinstein\\".) Notably, he has an on-and-off relationship with \\"a bright, attractive graduate student\\", Diane Chambers (Shelley Long).Carter, Bill. \\"TELEVISION; The Tonic That Keeps 'Cheers' Bubbling Along\\".

One time after Sam and Diane ended their on-and-off relationship, in \\"Rebound, Part One\\" (episode 45, 1984), Sam relapses into alcoholism and excessively womanizes. Diane finds this out from Coach, and involves her new love interest Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) in helping Sam slowly regain his sobriety in the following episode, \\"Rebound, Part Two\\". In the three-part episode \\"Strange Bedfellows\\" (episodes 93‚Äì95, 1986), Sam dates an intelligent, attractive politician Janet Eldridge (Kate Mulgrew), who eventually ends the relationship because of Sam's visible feelings for Diane. Throughout the fifth season (1986‚Äì87), Sam cyclically proposes to Diane, but she rejects every proposal until, in \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\" (episode 108, 1987), Diane finally accepts his latest proposal. In \\"I Do, Adieu\\" (episode 121, 1987), Sam and Diane try to marry but call off the wedding to let her start a supposedly promising writing career. In the following episode \\"Home Is the Sailor\\" (episode 122, 1987), Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation six months before the episode and later returns to the bar to work under employment of the \\"voluptuously beautiful\\" new manager, Rebecca Howe. Within this period, Sam constantly flirts with and attempts to seduce Rebecca, but she rejects all of his advances. In \\"Cry Harder\\" (episode 194, 1990), Sam is able to buy back the bar from the Lillian Corporation after Sam has saved the corporation from financial victimization by Robin Colcord (Roger Rees), Rebecca's lover. At the last minute, Sam and Rebecca embrace and kiss. However, in the following episode \\"Love Is a Really, Really, Perfectly Okay Thing\\" (episode 195, 1990), Sam devastatingly tells Rebecca that he has no feelings for her. In \\"The Days of Wine and Neuroses\\" (1990), Sam rejects Rebecca's advances one night while she is drunk over her doubts when now-impoverished Robin proposed to her. In the tenth season (1991‚Äì92), they try to conceive a child, but by then they have decided to stay friends. In \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\" (1993), Sam plays with the idea of marrying Rebecca (as a safety net \\"in case no one better comes along\\"), but several bar patrons and even Carla tell Sam his womanizing is getting him nowhere, prompting him to join Dr. Robert Sutton's (Gilbert Lewis) group meetings for sex addicts, a referral made by Frasier. In the series finale, \\"One for the Road\\" (1993), Sam reunites with Diane after six years of separation. They try to rekindle their relationship, but just before they fly off together to California, Sam and Diane begin to have doubts about their future together, and they re-separate. Sam returns to the bar, where his friends celebrate his return. Then, when Norm and Sam remain while everyone else leaves, Norm reassures Sam that Sam would return and never leave his one \\"true love\\"which the TV Guide implies is the Cheers bar.\\"TV's Best Finales Ever\\".

Development Ted Danson, portrayer of Sam Malone Conception, writing, and casting Before the series began in September 1982, various actors considered or were considered for the role of Sam Malone. Before he was cast, Ted Danson appeared in films and television series. Danson appeared in the 1979 film The Onion Field, adapted from the nonfiction book of the same name, as Officer Ian Campbell, who was murdered by two criminals. Danson also appeared in Taxi episode, \\"The Unkindest Cut\\" (1982), as one-time character Vincenzo Senaca‚Äî\\"a flamboyant and decidedly effeminate hairdresser, who ruined Elaine's but got his comeuppance at the end.\\" Cheers creators Glen and Les Charles‚Äîalong with James Burrows‚Äîwere executive consultants for the episode. Danson, William Devane and Fred Dryer were shortlisted for the role of Sam Malone. Ed O'Neill auditioned for the role but did not win the part. John Lithgow missed the audition because he was ill. Originally, Sam Malone was intended \\"to be a former wide receiver for the American football team, New England Patriots.\\"Meade, Peter. \\"We'll Cry In Our Beers As Sam, Diane Split.\\" Spartanburg Herald-Journal TV Update [Spartanburg, NC] April 29, 1984: 14.

Danson said about the way the character changed, \\"He got older, you know ... [the writers] tried to make him Sammy again. But he's 45 now. I'm 45. It's OK to be chasing around when you're 37. But when you're 45, it's kind of sad to be chasing around that way.\\" The producers tried to continue the show without Ted Danson, and they attempted to move the show to the first-run syndication, but these ideas were shelved. Characterization and analysis Sam's on-screen relationships with Diane and Rebecca were inspired by works about the \\"mixture of romance and antagonism of two people, [portrayed by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn], in a competitive situation\\".

Steve Craig from the University of North Texas wrote in his 1993 journal that Sam is a parody of \\"traditional male values\\" and of a negative stereotype of masculinity. Craig wrote that Sam's attempts to define and exemplify \\"his version of masculinity\\" are satirized throughout the series \\"to explore gender identity\\" without threatening the viewer's own definition of one's own gender.Craig. pp. 15‚Äì6.

Glen Charles, a creator of Cheers, considered Sam \\"a spokesman for a large group of people who thought that [the women's movement] was a bunch of bull and look with disdain upon people who don't think it was\\". Heather Hundley wrote that the series sends \\"double standards\\" about promiscuous men and women. Hundley said that Sam is portrayed as heroic. She further wrote that Sam never suffers from consequences of his promiscuity and has been happily single and childless,Hundley, p. 217 while it portrays Carla Tortelli as a \\"nymphomaniac\\"Hundley, p. 207 who regrets her own promiscuities, which lead to out-of-wedlock pregnancies. She said the series' portrayal of premarital sex is \\"negative and unhealthy\\", omitting other dangers of promiscuity such as sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.Hundley, p. 218 Mark LaFlamme of the Sun Journal called Sam's relationship with Rebecca Howe \\"mundane\\" and his flirtation with her \\"bawdy\\". Throughout most of Cheers, Sam is \\"allowed to be happy [and to live] a rich life\\". Towards the end of the series' run, however, Sam undergoes therapy for sex addiction. In a 1995 episode of Frasier called \\"The Show Where Sam Shows Up\\", Sam is depicted as a self-identified sexual addict; he gets help from group meetings and commits to changing himself.Hecht, 236.

Rees also said that the show would not survive without Sam and Danson. Television critic Phil Rosenthal from Los Angeles Daily News said Danson's performance as Sam was irreplaceable and that no other actor could capture Sam's \\"sexiness, vulnerability, and goofiness\\".

Her paintings, mainly portraits of anonymous female sitters, are rendered in a range of closely related tones. Although she was overshadowed during her lifetime by her brother Augustus John and her lover Auguste Rodin, her reputation has grown steadily since her death.  Early life  Vase of Flowers (ca. 1910s) Gwen John was born in Haverfordwest, Wales, the second of four children of Edwin William John and his wife Augusta (n√©e Smith). Gwen's elder brother was Thornton John; her younger siblings were Augustus and Winifred.Langdale 1987 Edwin John was a solicitor whose dour temperament cast a chill over his family, and Augusta was often absent from the children owing to ill health, leaving her two sisters‚Äîstern Salvationists‚Äîto take her place in the household.Langdale 1987, p. 3. Augusta was an amateur watercolourist, and both parents encouraged the children's interest in literature and art.Langdale 1987, p. 4. Her mother died when Gwen was eight years of age. Regarding her mother's death and the loss of her influence, her brother, Augustus, later wrote: \\"My mother would no doubt have been helpful, but she died when I was a small child, after, I fear, a very tearful existence.\\"Tamboukou, p. 4. Following their mother‚Äôs premature death in 1884, the family moved to Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales, where the early education of Gwen and her sister Winifred was provided by governesses.Langdale 1987, p. 5. In addition to her sister, she also had two brothers, Thornton and Augustus. The siblings often went to the coast of Tenby to sketch. John said that she would make \\"rapid drawings of beached gulls, shells and fish on stray pieces of paper, or sometimes in the frontispiece of the book she was reading.\\" Although she painted and drew from an early age, Gwen John's earliest surviving work dates from her nineteenth year.Langdale 1987, p. 7. Education From 1895 to 1898, she studied at the Slade School of Art, where the program was modeled after the French atelier method (various levels of student working under a master artist).Foster 1999, p. 10. It was the only art school in the United Kingdom that allowed female students, although there was generally no mixing of men and women on the grounds, in classes, or in corridors.Tamboukou pp. 4‚Äì5. Like her younger brother, Augustus, who had begun his studies there in 1894,Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 9. she studied figure drawing under Henry Tonks.Uglow, p. 284. During this period, she and Augustus shared living quarters, and further reduced their expenses by subsisting on a diet of nuts and fruit. She developed a close relationship with the woman who would become her brother's wife, Ida Nettleship. At this time, she also had a relationship with another of her brother's friends, Arthur Ambrose McEvoy, which turned out to be an unhappy relationship.Langdale 1987, p. 22. Good friends also included Ursula Tyrwhitt and Gwen Salmond.Tamboukou, p. 5. John won the Melvill Nettleship Prize for Figure Composition in her final year at Slade. Slade students were encouraged to copy the works of old masters in London museums. John's early paintings such as Portrait of Mrs. Atkinson, Young Woman with a Violin, and Interior with Figures are intimist works painted in a traditional style characterised by subdued colour and transparent glazes.Langdale 1987, p. 9. Even as a student, Augustus's brilliant draughtsmanship and personal glamour made him a celebrity, and stood in contrast to Gwen's quieter gifts and reticent demeanour. Augustus greatly admired his sister's work but believed she neglected her health, and urged her to take a \\"more athletic attitude to life\\". She refused his advice, and demonstrated throughout her life a marked disregard for her physical well-being.Langdale 1987, p. 14. In 1898 she made her first visit to Paris with two friends from the Slade, and while there she studied under James McNeill Whistler at his school, Acad√©mie Carmen. She returned to London in 1899, and exhibited her work for the first time in 1900, at the New English Art Club (NEAC).Foster 1999, p. 77. Her material circumstances were poor, and in 1900‚Äì01 she lived as a squatter in a derelict building.Langdale 1987, p. 21 and note, p. 125. France and early career In late 1903, she travelled to France with her friend Dorelia McNeill (who would later become Augustus John's second wife and whose daughter, Vivien John would also become an artist). Upon landing in Bordeaux, they set off on a walking tour with their art equipment in hand, intending to reach Rome. Sleeping in fields and living on money earned along the way by selling portrait sketches, they made it as far as Toulouse.Langdale 1987, p. 24. In 1904 the two went to Paris, where John found work as an artist's model, mostly for women artists. In that same year, she began modelling for the sculptor Auguste Rodin,, and became his lover after being introduced by Hilda Flodin. Her devotion to the much older Rodin, who was the most famous artist of his time, continued unabated for the next ten years, as documented in her thousands of fervent letters to him. John was given to fierce attachments to both men and women that were sometimes disturbing to them,Langdale 1987, p.15. and Rodin, despite his genuine feeling for her, eventually resorted to the use of conci√®rges and secretaries to keep her at a distance.Langdale 1987, pp. 31‚Äì33. During her years in Paris she met many of the leading artistic personalities of her time, including Matisse, Picasso, Br√¢ncu»ôi, and Rainer Maria Rilke,Foster 1999, p. 29. but the new developments in the art of her time had little effect on her, and she worked in solitude.Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 17. In 1910 she found living quarters in Meudon, a suburb of Paris where she would remain for the rest of her life. As her affair with Rodin drew to a close, John sought comfort in Catholicism, and around 1913 she was received into the Church.Langdale 1987, p. 50. Her notebooks of the period include meditations and prayers; she wrote of her desire to be \\"God's little artist\\"Foster 1999, p. 52. and to \\"become a saint.\\" In an often-quoted letter of ca. 1912, she wrote: \\"As to whether I have anything worth expressing that is apart from the question. I may never have anything to express, except this desire for a more interior life\\".Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 12. Career M√®re Poussepin, ca. late 1910s, Barber Institute, Birmingham She stopped exhibiting at the NEAC in 1911, but gained an important patron in John Quinn, an American art collector who, from 1910 until his death in 1924, purchased the majority of the works that Gwen John sold.Foster 1999, p. 26. Quinn's support freed John from having to work as a model, and enabled her to devote herself to her work. Although she participated in exhibitions fairly regularly, her perfectionism produced in her a marked ambivalence toward exhibiting. She wrote in 1911: \\"I paint a good deal, but I don't often get a picture done‚Äîthat requires, for me, a very long time of a quiet mind, and never to think of exhibitions.\\" In 1913, one of her paintings was included in the seminal Armory Show in New York, which Quinn assisted in organising.Quinn had sent John a telegram requesting \\"Four (or three) Gwen John\\"; her reply was \\"One Gwen John\\". Schwartz 2001, p. 37. Her attitude toward her work was both self-effacing and confident. After viewing an exhibition of watercolours by C√©zanne she remarked: \\"These are very good, but I prefer my own.\\"Langdale 1987, p. 1. About 1913, as an obligation to the Dominican Sisters of Charity at Meudon, she began a series of painted portraits of M√®re Marie Poussepin (1653‚Äì1744), the founder of their order. These paintings, based on a prayer card, established a format‚Äîthe female figure in three-quarter length seated pose‚Äîwhich became characteristic of her mature style.Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 41. She painted numerous variants on such subjects as Young Woman in a Spotted Blue Dress, Girl Holding a Cat, and The Convalescent. The identities of most of her models are unknown. In Meudon she lived in solitude, except for her cats. In an undated letter she wrote, \\"I should like to go and live somewhere where I met nobody I know till I am so strong that people and things could not effect me beyond reason.\\"Langdale 1987, p. 2. She wished also to avoid family ties (\\"I think the family has had its day. We don't go to Heaven in families now but one by one\\")Schwartz 2001, p. 36. and her decision to live in France after 1903 may have been the result of her desire to escape the overpowering personality of her famous brother, although, according to art historian David Fraser Jenkins, \\"there were few occasions when she did anything against her will, and she was the more ruthless and dominating of the two.\\"Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 36. John exhibited in Paris for the first time in 1919 at the Salon d'Automne, and exhibited regularly until the mid-1920s, after which time she became increasingly reclusive and painted less.Langdale 1987, p. 80. She had only one solo exhibition in her lifetime, at the New Chenil Galleries in London in 1926.Schwartz 2001, p. 36; Langdale; Jenkins; John 1986, p. 16. In that same year she purchased a bungalow in Meudon. In December 1926, distraught after the death of her old friend Rilke, she met and sought religious guidance from her neighbor, the neo-Thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain. She also met Maritain's sister-in-law, V√©ra Ouman√ßoff, with whom she formed her last romantic relationship, which lasted until 1930.Langdale 1987, p. 81. John's last dated work is a drawing of 20 March 1933, and no evidence suggests that she drew or painted during the remainder of her life.Langdale 1987, p. 116. On 10 September 1939, she wrote her will and then travelled to Dieppe, where she collapsed and was hospitalized. She died there on 18 September 1939 and was buried in Janval Cemetery. According to Paul Johnson in Art: A New History, 'she appears to have starved to death' (p. 675).  Art  Young Woman in a Red Shawl, ca. 1917-1923 The Convalescent (ca. 1923‚Äì24), one of ten versions she painted of this composition Girl with a Cat, Gwen John, Metropolitan Museum of Art In 1916, John wrote in a letter: \\"I think a picture ought to be done in 1 sitting or at most 2. For that one must paint a lot of canvases probably and waste them.\\"Foster 1999, p. 58. Her surviving oeuvre is comparatively small, comprising 158 known oil paintingsLangdale 1987, p. 122. which rarely exceed 24 inches in height or width. The majority are portraits, but she also painted still lifes, interiors and a few landscapes. She wrote, \\"...a cat or a man, its the same thing ... its an affair of volumes ... the object is of no importance.\\" Although she lived in France from the age of 28 until she died, her work always displayed a British sensibility. Her early paintings, such as the Portrait of the Artist's Sister Winifred (ca. 1897‚Äì98) and Dorelia in a Black Dress (1903‚Äì04), are painted using thin glazes in the traditional manner of the old masters. Beginning with her series of paintings of M√®re Poussepin (ca. 1913), her style is characterised by thicker paint applied in small, mosaic-like touches.Foster 1999, p. 57. It became her habit to paint the same subject repeatedly. Her portraits are usually of anonymous female sitters seated in a three-quarter length format, with their hands in their laps. One of her models, Jeanne Foster, wrote of John: \\"She takes down my hair and does it like her own ... she has me sit as she does, and I feel the absorption of her personality as I sit\\". John's drawings number in the thousands.Langdale 1987, p. vi. In addition to studio work, she made many sketches and watercolours of women and children in church. Unlike her oil paintings of solitary women, these sketches frequently depict their subjects from behind, and in groups. She also made many sketches of her cats. Aside from two etchings she drew in 1910, she made no prints. Her notebooks and letters contain numerous personal formulae for observing nature, painting a portrait, designating colors by a system of numbers, and the like. Their meaning is often obscure, but they reveal John's predilection for order and the lasting influence of Whistler, whose teaching emphasised systematic preparation.Langdale 1987, pp. 17‚Äì21. Gwen John's art, in its quietude and its subtle colour relationships, stands in contrast to her brother's far more vivid and assertive work. Though she was once overshadowed by her popular brother, critical opinion now tends to view Gwen as the more talented of the two. Augustus himself had predicted this reversal, saying \\"In 50 years' time I will be known as the brother of Gwen John.\\" Sexuality Throughout her life John was attracted to people of both sexes. As a student she had an affair with fellow artist Ambrose McEvoy. Although Auguste Rodin was her great love, she had a number of same-sex relationships. Whilst at Slade she developed a passion for an unnamed woman which her brother Augustus describes in his autobiography Chiaroscuro and whilst walking to Paris with Dorelia, she developed a passion for a married girl, who then followed them to Paris. Rodin, who had a sexual relationship with his assistant Hilda Flodin, drew erotic drawings of Flodin and John together. The German painter Ida Gerhardi fell in love with John but it was not reciprocated. John's last passion was V√©ra Ouman√ßoff, for whom she developed an obsession, much to the discomfort of V√©ra.Shopland, Norena 'Like a shadow I am' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales Seren Books (2017)  Legacy  John's pictures are held in many public collections. Some of the best examples are in the National Museum Cardiff and in Tate Britain, London. Still Lives, by Candida Cave, is a three- woman play about Gwen, Ida (Augustus John's wife) and Dorelia (Augustus John's mistress). An art mystery novel The Gwen John Sculpture, by John Malcolm, features her stay in Meudon, France and her relationship with Rodin. An S4C documentary presented by Ffion Hague about Gwen John's life included filming of the unveiling of a memorial plaque to the artist in Dieppe's Janval Cemetery in 2015. Margaret Forster wrote a novel, published 2006, Keeping the World Away, centred upon a picture by John, A Corner of the Artist‚Äôs Room in Paris, which starts with the story of John herself and then follows stories of fictional women who subsequently owned it and responded to it. The title comes from something written by John: \\"Rules to Keep the World away: Do not listen to people (more than is necessary); Do not look at people (ditto); Have as little intercourse with people as possible; When you come into contact with people, talk as little a possible ...\\" 3 March 1912, Gwen John Papers, National Library of Wales. John was the aunt of Amaryllis Fleming, her brother's illegitimate daughter with his other mistress Evelyn Fleming, whose husband Valentine was a Member of Parliament and died in the First World War. Through Amaryllis, John was a grandaunt to actress and Evelyn's granddaughter Lucy Fleming.

She is best known for her role as Columbia in the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and the original stage play from which it was adapted. In 1978, Campbell released her debut EP, The Musical World of Little Nell (Aquatic Teenage Sex & Squalor). She appeared as Nurse Ansalong in the 1981 film Shock Treatment. Early life Campbell was born in Sydney, to Ruth and Ross Campbell, a writer, Note: [on-line] version established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition. who referred to her as \\"Little Nell\\" (after a character in Charles Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop) in his family life column in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. She has three siblings: Sally, Patrick, and Cressida. Her older sister, Sally, was a property master, set designer and subsequently a fashion designer, while her younger sister, Cressida Campbell, an artist, and her older brother, Patrick, a solar engineer at the University of New South Wales. She began dancing at the age of 10 to keep healthy following being diagnosed with hepatitis A. She was called Laura E. Campbell until around 17, when she went by the nickname \\"Sonny\\" (pronounced to rhyme with \\"Donny\\"), short for \\"Sonata\\". She attended high school at Abbotsleigh School for Girls in Sydney, supporting herself as a waitress. Career Campbell decided to use the name \\"Little Nell\\" as a stage name after her arrival in Britain in the early 1970s with her family. She sold clothes at Kensington Market; her stall was next to Freddie Mercury's. She also worked as a busker and as a soda jerk in a caf√©, where her tap dancing is often noted as the reason why she was cast as Columbia in the original production of The Rocky Horror Show following an impromptu audition. She reprised the role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, released in 1975, and starred as Nurse Ansalong in the 1981 sequel, Shock Treatment. After The Rocky Horror Picture Show, she signed a recording contract with A&M; Records. Her debut single was \\"Stilettos and Lipstick\\" backed with \\"Do the Swim\\", released in 1975. She also created a disco version of the song \\"Fever\\" in 1976 which was again backed with \\"Do the Swim\\". The B-side of both of these releases became better known, perhaps helped by a performance on British television in which she accidentally (and repeatedly) exposed her breasts. While edited out of the original broadcast in 1975, the unedited version was shown worldwide on bloopers shows (beginning with the British show It'll be Alright on the Night in 1977). Following this notoriety, another effort was made to promote the recordings made in 1975 and 1976. In 1978, a \\"triple B-side\\" titled The Musical World of Little Nell (Aquatic Teenage Sex & Squalor) was released which featured both \\"Do the Swim\\" and \\"Stillettos and Lipstick\\" along with the track \\"Dance that Cocktail Latin Way\\" (also known as \\"Tropical Isle\\") which originally appeared as the B-side of her second single from 1976. Following some success with the EP, the other two tracks, singles \\"Fever\\" and \\"See You Round like a Record\\", were released as a single but that was to be her last release on A&M.; A final single, \\"Beauty Queen\\" from the film The Alternative Miss World, was released on PRE Records in 1980. Campbell has also appeared in several stage productions, including the Off-Broadway play You Should Be So Lucky and the Broadway musical Nine. She appeared as Sandra LeMon in the British TV series Rock Follies of '77. In 1986 she opened the nightclub Nell's on W. 14th St in Manhattan with Keith McNally and Lynn Wagenknecht. In 1995 she opened two restaurants in New York: The Kiosk (uptown) and E&O; (downtown). Nell's was sold in 1998 to Noel Ashman and his business partner actor Chris Noth, right before she gave birth to daughter Matilda Violet in June 1998 to ex-boyfriend and business partner Eamonn Roche. Campbell has written several magazine articles, including regular segments called \\"MamaTalks\\" and \\"FirstLook\\" in the now defunct Talk magazine, starting in the December 1999 issue. She returned to Australia after selling her Boerum Hill house in Brooklyn in December 2005, and is now living with her daughter. The song \\"Laura\\" by Bat for Lashes is dedicated to Campbell, who is friends with Natasha Khan.

It is located on the foothills of Papuk mountain and along the Toplica river. The main political and cultural centre of the Czech national minority in Croatia, it has a winemaking tradition reportedly dating back more than 2000 years. Geography * Coordinates: * Area: 64 km2 * Altitude: 190 m Daruvar is located 125 km from Zagreb, the national capital, and 130 km from Osijek, the main city of Slavonia to the east. The closest cities are: Pakrac, Lipik, Novska, Kri≈æevci, Bjelovar, Virovitica. Administration Daruvar is located in the Bjelovar-Bilogora County. The list of settlements within the city limits is: * Daruvar, population 8,567 * Daruvarski Vinogradi, population 164 * Doljani, population 759 * Donji Daruvar, population 731 * Gornji Daruvar, population 436 * Lipovac Majur, population 83 * Ljudevit Selo, population 252 * Markovac, population 80 * Vrbovac, population 561 Etymology Its name is a conjunction of the Hungarian words daru () and v√°r (). History Daruvar town center Daruvarske Toplice Park Archaeological findings here, (stone axes), could be traced back to the Stone Age. The history of Daruvar could be traced to the 4th century BC, when the first organized habitation emerged near the warm geothermal spas in today's Daruvar valley. Celtic - Pannonian tribes living here and familiar with water treatments benefiting health, were Iassi, (meaning healers), so called by both Greek and Roman writers. As allies of the Roman Empire, the tribes provided support to Emperor Augustus during the siege of Siscia, (today's Sisak), and in year 35, Iassi were granted local autonomy known as Res Publica Iasorum. The center of it was Aqua Balissae, meaning very strong springs. In the year 124, during the reign of Hadrian, the area gained additional autonomy as Municipium Iassorum. Stretching between the rivers Sava and Drava, on the roads which ran between Siscia-Mursa, (Sisak- Osijek), Salona-Aquincum, Sirmium-Poetovio, it was easy to access. As did Hadrian, emperors Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, Septimius Severus and Constantine I, all visited Aqua Balissae's thermal complex, its decorated temple, its forum and its, (though not as big as the one in Pula), amphitheatre. After the fall of Western Roman Empire and the destruction of local tribes by Avar Kaghanate in 6th century this area was resettled by Croats, a Slavic tribe that came to Balkans in 7th century. In the 11th century the region became part of a mightier entity, that of the rapidly growing and politically important city of Kri≈æevci. Within, it became part of the archdiocese of Zagreb mentioned by legislators for the first time in 1334. Since the city was on a busy crossroads, there were four trading points within the valley -- ƒåetvrtkovac, Dimiƒçkovine, Podborje and Toplice, (toplice=spas in Croatian). And, as it was more than millennium ago, pleasant spas kept attracting people. The population in that period was exclusively Catholic. In the 15th and 16th centuries, all that changed. Expansion of the Ottoman Empire disrupted the steady development and Turks occupied lands here in 1543. The Monastery of St King Ladislaus was degraded, becoming a Turkish defensive post looking into the Krajina, military zone created to protect the Habsburg Empire just west of the city. Local people fled from Turks. Turks were expelled in 1699 and the now ethnically mixed area came under the rule of Vienna in 1745. Podborje, Siraƒç and Pakrac were bought by count Antun Jankoviƒá who in 1771 renamed Podborje as Daruvar, (daru=crane in Hungarian), after a building of his own called the Crane's castle. In 1837 Daruvar was declared a free city by decree of king Ferdinand I. Empty lands were repopulated by people skilled in crafts, trade, agriculture from around Croatia and beyond. Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Italians, (around so called Little Italy) and others were invited to come. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Daruvar was part of the Po≈æega County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Parts of Daruvar's suburbs were briefly captured by militants from the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia during the Croatian War of Independence. Climate Demographics According to the census of 2011, the population of the Daruvar municipality (township) was 11,633. In ethnic terms, 61.28% are Croats, 21.36% Czechs, 12.28% Serbs and 0.98% Hungarians. As for the religion, 75.49% are Catholics, 10.23% Orthodox, and 7.62% are agnostics and atheists. The Czech population is of significant size having its own newspaper, schools, societies and clubs, (ƒåesk√° beseda or Czech word, Jednota - Unity in Czech language), publishing company. The entire area, (Veliki Zdenci, Grubi≈°no Polje, Konƒçanica), is actually bilingual with Czech being the second official language. There are numerous local ethnic festivities celebrating important points in different cultures -- youth, harvest etc. with most interesting and picturesque that of the Czech minority. Spas Water treatments benefiting health were well known to mentioned Iassi tribes here almost 2500 years ago, later widely used by Romans and in the Middle Ages. In 1772 owner of the area Antun Jankoviƒá started building around the springs, envisioning correctly that the town might become healing, leisure and recreation center again as it was proven through the course of history. He erected numerous buildings, many of them still functional -- (Anton's spa, Ivan's spa ). After 1897 newly opened railroad brought new visitors. Restaurant Teresa, Swiss villa, Villa Arcadia, Big Mud Spa with its prominent dome and today well known city mark were all built during the turn of 19 and 20th century. Daruvarske Toplice is a special hospital complex for rehabilitation specializing in treatment of female fertility (primary and secondary sterility), with two clinics for esthetic surgery. Warm waters (33 to 47 ¬∞C) are also used in postoperative rehabilitation, treatment of inflammations, rheumatism, the trauma of bones, hips, head, spine, and locomotion. More spas are around Pakrac and Lipik where there is also a mineral water bottling plant. The park within the complex is positioned containing 65 different kind of trees like 250-year-old Ginkgo tree from China, Variegatum from Arizona and others. Pleasant Hotel Termal renovated and extended in 1996 is also here. The smaller one, Balisse is just few minutes walking distance from here in the traffic friendly downtown. Tourism The Area is rich in monuments. Historic Kistalovac, Pavlovina, Siraƒç, Bagenovaƒá, Dobra Kuƒáa, Stupƒçanica are examples of numerous local castles belonging to the Croatian nobility of the times passed by. Franciscan monasteries like that ones of St. Margareth, St. Ana, St. three kings, Church of Holy Trinity are witnesses of the rich religious culture. Economy German people who came here in the 18th century as well Czechs in the 19th were the keystone of the revival participating in agriculture, food processing plants, culture and education. The development was accelerated on the turn of the centuries by being connected to the railroad track from Banova Jaruga to Barcs in Hungary. Important historic moment was in 1897 witnessed by the emperor Franz Joseph himself. Since 1840 a brewery is operating here producing today more than 250,000 hectoliters of beer based upon old and famous Czech recipes, with Old Bohemian, (Staroƒçe≈°ko pivo), brand being the most known. Zdenka of Veliki Zdenci is well known for its milk and melted cheese processing plant. Fish is cultivated in artificial lakes around Konƒçanica and processed within Irida. Here are local high quality vines as Gra≈°evina, (ranking the highest), Rhein Riesling, Chardonnay and Sauvignon. Here are fruit, maize, wheat, meat and other agriculture products produced for local, national and wider market s. Dalit, created in 1905, is a metal processing plant once one of the biggest in what was once Yugoslavia, employing today 320, but in the late 70es almost 2000 people. Flat glass factory is in Lipik. There are small graphics and printing, (Daruvarska Tiskara d.d., Logos), facility and textile plant Vesna which is employing around 200. Growing is the importance of the trade, tourism and communication. 2300 people are employed one third of them women. Education The first school was opened in 1856. A school for women was opened here in 1866.

The idea of a sphere-world was constructed by Henri Poincar√© who, while pursuing his argument for conventionalism (see philosophy of space and time), offered a thought experiment about a sphere with strange properties. The concept Poincar√© asks us to imagine a sphere of radius R. The temperature of the sphere decreases from its maximum at the center to absolute zero at its extremity such that a body‚Äôs temperature at a distance r from the center is proportional to R^2-r^2. In addition, all bodies have the same coefficient of dilatation so every body shrinks and expands in similar proportion as they move about the sphere. To finish the story, Poincar√© states that the index of refraction will also vary with the distance r, in inverse proportion to R^2-r^2. How will this world look to inhabitants of this sphere? In many ways it will look normal. Bodies will remain intact upon transfer from place to place, as well as seeming to remain the same size (the Spherians would shrink along with them). The geometry, on the other hand, would seem quite different. Supposing the inhabitants were to view rods believed to be rigid, or measure distance with light rays. They would find that a geodesic is not a straight line, and that the ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference to its radius is greater than 2\\\\pi. These inhabitants would in fact determine that their universe is not ruled by Euclidean geometry, but instead by hyperbolic geometry. Commentary This thought experiment is discussed in Roberto Torretti's book Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincar√© and in Jeremy Gray's article \\"Epistemology of Geometry\\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. This sphere-world is also described in Ian Stewart's book Flatterland (chapter 10, Platterland).

Portrait of Mr. Felix Slade, c. 1851, by Margaret Sarah Carpenter A fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1866) and a philanthropist who endowed three Slade Professorships of Fine Art at Oxford University and Cambridge University, and at University College London, where he also endowed scholarships which formed the beginning of the Slade School of Art (founded 1871) in London, whose Director holds the Slade Professorship. The bequest was also indirectly responsible for the foundation of the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford, which was financed by the first Oxford Professor, John Ruskin, who announced his intention in his inaugural lecture \\"to the general dismay of his listeners\\".Official History of Oxford University, Vol VII The Oxford and Cambridge professorships are visiting ones, who give the Slade Lectures, one of the most prestigious series of lectures on the history of art, which are commonly published. The first Slade Professors were John Ruskin, at Oxford, and Matthew Digby Wyatt at Cambridge; Edward Poynter RA. gave the first lecture on 2 October 1871 at University College, London.DNB, citing Poynter, Lectures on Art, 1879. He was the son of Robert Slade, a Surrey landowner and proctor in Doctors' Commons, who eventually became deputy lieutenant for Surrey, and his wife Eliza Foxcroft of Halsteads (near Thornton-in-Lonsdale, Yorkshire). From his father he inherited a considerable fortune, which supported his purchases of books and prints. He lived with his bachelor brother Henry in the family house in Walcot Place (in the Kennington area of London) and built up a valuable collection of historical glass. When he died unmarried he left a fortune of ¬£160,000 and bequeathed the bulk of his art collection to the British Museum; the books are now in the British Library. One of the features of the book collection includes twenty-five bindings from 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, representing English, French and Italian styles. ¬£35,000 was specified for the endowment of art professorships, to be known as Slade Professorships, at Oxford, Cambridge, and University College, London. University College received the additional bequest of six art scholarships for students, the nucleus of the Slade School of Art. He meticulously catalogued his collection of glass, which was published in 1869 and 1871. Slade was the subject of a portrait in coloured chalk by Margaret Sarah Carpenter.

In 1997, she received the official endorsement of REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking for the project. Mora based Dia on Mexican National Children's Day festivities held since 1925. The two part celebration of D√≠a includes a commitment to promote literacy and bookjoy, and culminates in book celebrations that unite communities. When choosing a date to kick off D√≠a, she chose April 30 because it was the last day of National Poetry month. The first Dia took place in 1996. Children's Day, Book Day, has grown in the U.S. to include all children, languages and cultures. Mora has expressed the desire to have books, celebrations and materials for Dia to include \\"all languages spoken in the United States.\\" In 2004, the Association for Library Services to Children's (ALSC) division of the American Library Association became an active partner for Dia.

He was born in Saketa in northern India. He is believed to have been the first Sanskrit dramatist, and is considered the greatest Indian poet prior to KƒÅlidƒÅsa. He was the most famous in a group of Buddhist court writers, whose epics rivalled the contemporary Ramayana.Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 220. Whereas much of Buddhist literature prior to the time of A≈õvagho·π£a had been composed in PƒÅli and Prakrit, A≈õvagho·π£a wrote in Classical Sanskrit. Life as an ascetic According to the traditional biography of A≈õvagho·π£a,Li Rongxi (2002). The Life of Asvaghosa Bodhisattva; in: The Lives of Great Monks and Nuns, Berkeley CA: Numata Center for Translation and Research, pp. 9‚Äì16Stuart H. Young (trans.), Biography of the Bodhisattva A≈õvagho·π£a, Maming pusa zhuan È¶¨È≥¥Ëè©Ëñ©ÂÇ≥, T.50.2046.183a, translated by Tripi·π≠aka Master KumƒÅrajƒ´va. which was translated into Chinese by KumƒÅrajƒ´va, and preserved in that language, he was originally a wandering ascetic who was able to defeat all-comers in debate. He set a challenge to the Buddhist monks that if none could meet with him in debate then they should stop beating the wood-block which signalled to the people to bring offerings to them. There was no one there to meet the challenge so they stopped beating the wood-block. However, in the north there was an elder bhik·π£u named PƒÅr≈õva at the time, who saw that if he could convert this ascetic, it would be a great asset to the propagation of the Dharma, so he travelled from northern India and had the wood-block sounded. The ascetic came to ask why it had been sounded. Though thinking the old monk would be unable to debate with him, he accepted the challenge. After seven days, the debate was held in front of the King, his Ministers, and many ascetics and brahmans. The loser agreed to become the disciple of the other. They agreed that the elder PƒÅr≈õva should speak first, and he said: \\"The world should be made peaceable, with a long-lived king, plentiful harvests, and joy throughout the land, with none of the myriad calamities\\", to which the ascetic had no response and so was bound to become PƒÅr≈õva's disciple, and he was given full ordination as a bhik·π£u. Although he had to consent to this, he still was not convinced of the elder's virtues until he showed him he had mastered the Bases of Spiritual Power (rÃ•ddhipƒÅdƒÅ·∏•), at which point he gained faith. PƒÅr≈õva then taught him the 5 Faculties, the 5 Powers, the 7 Factors and the 8-fold Noble Path, and he eventually mastered the teaching. Later, the central kingdom was besieged by the Ku·π£ƒÅna King's army, who demanded 300,000 gold pieces in tribute. The King could not pay so much, as he had only 100,000. The Ku·π£ƒÅna King therefore asked for the Buddha's begging bowl, the converted monk, and the 100,000 gold pieces for his tribute. Although the King of the central kingdom was unhappy, the monk persuaded him it would be for the good of the propagation of the Dharma which would spread across the four continents if he went with the Ku·π£ƒÅna King. He was therefore taken away. thumb The Ku·π£ƒÅna's King's Ministers, however, were unhappy, not thinking that the bhik·π£u was priced correctly at 100,000 gold pieces. The King, who knew the worth of bhiksu, ordered that seven horses be starved for six days. The King then made an assembly and had the bhik·π£u preach the Dharma. Even the horses, whose favourite food was placed in front of them, were entranced by the Teaching of the monk, and listened intently. Everybody was thereby convinced of his worth. He was then granted the name A≈õvagho·π£a, Horse-Cry. He travelled throughout northern India proclaiming the Dharma and guiding all through his wisdom and understanding, and he was held in great regard by the four-fold assembly, who knew him as The Sun of Merit and Virtue. Written works He was previously believed to have been the author of the influential Buddhist text Awakening of Mahayana Faith, but modern scholars agree that the text was composed in China.Nattier, Jan.

Some recent research into his kavya poems have revealed that he may have used the Yogacarabhumi as a textual reference, particularly for the Saundarananda, which opens up the possibility he was affiliated with either the Yogacara or the Sautrantika school.Yamabe, Nobuyoshi.

He also wrote Saundarananda, a kƒÅvya poem with the theme of conversion of Nanda, Buddha's half-brother, so that he might reach salvation. The first half of the work describes Nanda's life, and the second half of the work describes Buddhist doctrines and ascetic practices.Yoshichika Honda.

It is a general entertainment channel, focusing primarily on programs pertaining to popular culture. The network was originally launched in 1981 as a barker channel service providing a display of localized channel and program listings for cable television providers. Later on, the service, branded Prevue Channel or Prevue Guide and later as Prevue, began to broadcast interstitial segments alongside the on-screen guide, which included entertainment, news, and promotions for upcoming programs. After Prevue's parent company, United Video Satellite Group, acquired the entertainment magazine TV Guide in 1998 (UVSG would in turn, be acquired by Gemstar the following year), the service was relaunched as TV Guide Channel (later TV Guide Network), which now featured full-length programs dealing with the entertainment industry, including news magazines and reality shows, along with red carpet coverage from major award shows. Following the acquisition of TV Guide Network by Lionsgate in 2009, its programming began to shift towards a general entertainment format with reruns of dramas and sitcoms. In 2013, CBS Corporation acquired of a 50% stake in the network, and the network was renamed TVGN. At the same time, as its original purpose grew obsolete because of the integrated program guides offered by digital television platforms, the network began to downplay and phase out its program listings service; as of June 2014, none of the network's carriage contracts require the display of the listings, and they were excluded entirely from its high-definition simulcast. In 2015, the network was rebranded as Pop. In 2019, CBS acquired Lionsgate's 50% stake in the network and merged with Viacom. Pop is available to 67.348 million households in America as of September 2018. History On September 18, 2014, CBS and Lionsgate announced that TVGN (previously TV Guide Network) would be relaunched as Pop in early 2015, with the rebranding later announced to occur on January 14 of that year. The newly branded channel would shift toward programming about pop culture fandom and would carry 400 hours of original programming following the rebrand, including a reality show starring New Kids on the Block and the Canadian sitcom Schitt's Creek, the first program from Pop TV to receive Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Pop was made available on AT&T; U-verse on March 1, 2016. On March 12, 2019, CBS acquired Lionsgate's 50% stake in Pop, making Pop a part of CBS Cable Networks. It then became part of ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks on December 4, 2019, when CBS merged with Viacom. Now under the latter's management, it was merged into Viacom's existing cable unit with corresponding job losses due to redundancies. As Viacom traditionally has their programming produced internally for their cable networks rather than from outside producers, second-season renewals for Flack and Florida Girls, along with a series order for Best Intentions were revoked, with Viacom freeing all three series to be shopped to other venues without penalty. Programming Current programming seen on Pop includes a mix of original scripted and reality series, acquired and internationally co-produced series and reruns of shows sourced from the CBS Television Distribution library. Previously, the network also aired professional wrestling from Impact Wrestling and the Las Vegas-based Paragon Pro Wrestling.

Its programming consists solely of theatrically released motion pictures released from the 1970s to the present day, interspersed with some films from the 1950s and 1960s. It is the only premium television service in the United States that does not operate any multiplex channels that provide additional programming alongside the main service. Although Flix is typically offered as part of the Showtime multiplex, the channel's carriage varies depending on both the cable provider and market, therefore it may not be available alongside Showtime and The Movie Channel's multiplex services in all areas. Although one or both of the channels have traditionally been carried alongside the Showtime multiplex on cable and satellite providers, , Flix as well as The Movie Channel are not presently carried by any of the over-the-top subscription television services ‚Äì Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Now ‚Äì that carry most or all of the eight Showtime multiplex channels. History The network launched on August 1, 1992, as a single-channel \\"mini-pay\\" service. Flix originally featured movies from the 1960s to the 1980s, although it would gradually begin to scatter some 1990s film titles onto the network's schedule over time. At its launch, Flix had been one of the last premium channels to restrict the broadcast of R-rated films to the nighttime hours. A notable aspect of Flix during its early days was that the channel did not solely advertise the channel's own prime time lineup, but also ran a schedule of programs that were slated to air that evening on the other major U.S. premium channels ‚Äì including HBO, Cinemax and Encore as well as sister networks Showtime and The Movie Channel ‚Äì during breaks between daytime movies (since 2002, Showtime has been the only other premium service that the network has provided prime time listings during its prime time lineup segment). Three years prior to the channel's launch, in 1989, Tele-Communications Inc. made a failed bid to acquire a 50% ownership stake in Showtime from Viacom. There was some debate as to whether Viacom or TCI originally conceived the idea for Encore, another (one-time) \\"mini-pay\\" service that was originally similar in format to Flix, which also focused on films from the 1960s to the 1980s until a format change in 1999 in which that channel added more recent films to its schedule. Viacom executives insisted that TCI lifted part of the idea for Encore from the company's Showtime Networks division. John Sie, the president of Encore at the time, said in a 1991 interview with Multichannel News that TCI brought up the concept of the Encore network as a way to revitalize Showtime, either by launching a new tertiary service from scratch or by overhauling the format of Showtime's existing sister network The Movie Channel. On June 14, 2005, Viacom decided to separate itself into two companies (only six years after the company's acquisition of CBS), both of which would be controlled by Viacom parent National Amusements, amid stagnation of the company's stock price. The original Viacom was restructured as CBS Corporation and acquired Showtime Networks along with CBS' broadcasting assets, Paramount Television (now the separate arms CBS Television Studios for network and cable production, and CBS Television Distribution for production of first-run syndicated programs and off-network series distribution), advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (renamed CBS Outdoor), Simon & Schuster and Paramount Parks (which was later sold); the new Viacom kept Paramount Pictures, the MTV Networks and BET Networks cable divisions, and Famous Music (the latter was sold off in 2007). In 2007, Flix began to broadcast certain R-rated movies during daytime timeslots. That same year, Flix began to air movies released in 2000, including such titles as Reindeer Games and Pitch Black; other films released during the 2000s have been added to the network's schedule since then. On December 4, 2019, nearly 14 years after the companies split, Viacom and CBS Corporation remerged; Showtime Networks (including Flix) became part of ViacomCBS while reuniting the brand with the aforementioned Viacom brands. Related services Flix On Demand Flix On Demand. Flix On Demand is the channel's subscription video-on-demand service; it is available to subscribers who receive the channel along with the other Showtime multiplex channels, though a few cable systems carry it as a free service that does not require a subscription as an inducement for customers to subscribe to the full Showtime suite of channels. Launched in 2005, Flix On Demand offers classic movies released between the 1950s and the 1990s, which are divided by category based on the decade of their release: 1950s and 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Programming Movie library , Flix ‚Äì through Showtime ‚Äì maintains exclusive first-run film licensing agreements with network sister company CBS Films (since 2007), Amblin Partners, IFC Films, Global Road Entertainment, and STX Entertainment. Flix also shows sub-runs ‚Äì runs of films that have already received broadcast or syndicated television airings ‚Äì of theatrical films from Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (including content from subsidiaries Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, and Hollywood Pictures), Sony Pictures, Miramax (including content from Revolution Studios and Morgan Creek Productions), Universal Studios (including content from subsidiary Focus Features), Samuel Goldwyn Films, Bleecker Street (after Amazon Prime's pay TV window for its individual releases concludes), Summit Entertainment (for films released prior to 2013), The Weinstein Company (for films released between 2009 and 2016, including those by Dimension Films), Anchor Bay Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer (including content from subsidiaries United Artists and Orion Pictures), Paramount Pictures, and Lionsgate (sub-run rights with the latter three studios are for films released prior to 2009). Although it does not hold the pay television rights to telecast recent films from 20th Century Fox ‚Äì which are held by HBO, ‚Äì Flix does run independent films to which that studio owns the home video rights, regardless as to whether they were released theatrically. Usually films that Showtime holds the pay-cable rights to broadcast will also run on Flix and sister service The Movie Channel during the period of its term of license agreement. Many lesser-known film titles (particularly those released as independent films) that have either not received a theatrical release or were released on DVD or home video are also commonly broadcast on Flix. The window between a film's initial release in theaters and its initial screening on Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix is wider than the grace period leading to a film's initial broadcast on HBO, Cinemax or Starz. Films that Showtime has pay cable rights to will usually also run on Flix and The Movie Channel during the period of its term of licensing.

The leaves are alternate, long and are pinnately lobed, divided almost to the center into about seven pairs of segments, or lobes, which are again divided into smaller lobes having saw-toothed edges, giving the leaf a somewhat fern- like appearance. The roundish, flat-topped, button-like, yellow flower heads are produced in terminal clusters from mid-to-late summer. The scent is similar to that of camphor with hints of rosemary. The leaves and flowers are toxic if consumed in large quantities; the volatile oil contains toxic compounds including thujone, which can cause convulsions and liver and brain damage. Some insects, notably the tansy beetle Chrysolina graminis, have resistance to the toxins and subsist almost exclusively on the plant. History and distribution Tansy is native to Eurasia; it is found in almost all parts of mainland Europe, as well as Britain and Ireland. It is absent from Siberia and some of the Mediterranean islands. The ancient Greeks may have been the first to cultivate it as a medicinal herb. In the sixteenth century it was considered to be \\"necessary for a garden\\" in Britain. History of uses Tansy has a long history of use. It was first recorded as being cultivated by the ancient Greeks for medicinal purposes. In the 8th century AD it was grown in the herb gardens of Charlemagne and by Benedictine monks of the Swiss monastery of Saint Gall. Tansy was used to treat intestinal worms, rheumatism, digestive problems, fevers, sores, and to bring out measles. During the Middle Ages and later, high doses were used to induce abortions. Contradictorily, tansy was also used to help women conceive and to prevent miscarriages. In the 15th century, Christians began serving tansy with Lenten meals to commemorate the bitter herbs eaten by the Israelites. Tansy was thought to have the added Lenten benefits of controlling flatulence brought on by days of eating fish and pulses and of preventing the intestinal worms believed to be caused by eating fish during Lent. Tansy was used as a face wash and was reported to lighten and purify the skin. In the 19th century, Irish folklore suggested that bathing in a solution of tansy and salts would cure joint pain. Insect repellent Tansy has also been cultivated and used for its insect repellent and in the type of embalming. It was packed into coffins, wrapped in funeral winding sheets, and tansy wreaths were sometimes placed on the dead. Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard University, was buried wearing a tansy wreath in a coffin packed with tansy; when \\"God‚Äôs Acre\\" was moved in 1846 the tansy had maintained its shape and fragrance, helping to identify the president's remains. By the 19th century, tansy was used so much at New England funerals that people began to disdain it for its morbid association with death. During the American colonial period, meat was frequently rubbed with or packed in tansy leaves to repel insects and delay spoilage. Tansy was frequently worn at that time in shoes to prevent malaria and other fevers; it has been shown, however, that some mosquito species, including Culex pipiens, take nectar from tansy flowers. Tansy can be used as in companion planting and for biological pest control. It is planted alongside potatoes to repel the Colorado potato beetle, with one study finding tansy reduced the beetle population by 60 to 100 percent. In England tansy is placed on window sills to repel flies; sprigs are placed in bed linen to drive away pests, and it has been used as an ant repellent. In the 1940s, distilled tansy oil mixed with fleabane, pennyroyal and diluted alcohol was a well-known mosquito repellent; collectors were paid five cents a pound for tansy in full bloom. Research has found that tansy extracts do indeed repel mosquitoes, but not as effectively as products containing DEET. In 2008, researchers in Sweden investigated the use of tansy to repel ticks, showing a 64‚Äì72 percent repellency for each oil constituent. Toxicity Tansy flower: detail Many tansy species contain a volatile oil which can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. If taken internally, toxic metabolites are produced as the oil is broken down in the liver and digestive tract. It is highly toxic to internal parasites, and for centuries tansy tea has been prescribed by herbalists to expel worms. Tansy is an effective insecticide and is highly toxic to arthropods.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, Because it contains thujone, the U.S. FDA limits the use of tansy to alcoholic beverages, and the final product must be thujone-free.Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption. Food and Drug Administration (2007). Retrieved Mar 30, 2008. Tanacetum annuum is often confused with common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) but the former produces an essential oil that is completely different chemically as it contains no thujone and high amounts of chamazulene making the oil dark blue in color, giving rise to its common name of Blue Tansy Oil.J. Essent. Oil Res., Vol. 11, 343-348 (1999)J. Essent. Oil Res., Vol. 12, 122-124 (Jan/Feb 2000) Despite claims by some unethical resellers of essential oils who adulterate the very expensive Blue Tansy (Tanacetum annuum) oil with the much cheaper oil from Tanacetum vulgare, the oil from Tanacetum vulgare is never blue in color as it contains no chamazulene.J. Agric. Food Chem., 2004, 52 (6), pp 1742‚Äì1748J. Nat. Prod., 1984, 47 (6), pp 964‚Äì969. For this reason a high thujone oil from Tanacetum vulgare should never be referred to as \\"Blue Tansy\\" oil and any such blue oil containing significant thujone is an adulterated product. The active components of the volatile oil include 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-Cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. Culinary uses Tansy foil Tansy was formerly used as a flavouring for puddings and omelettes, but is now almost unknown, except in Cork, where it is used in a sauce to accompany drisheens. The herbalist John Gerard (c. 1545‚Äì1612) noted that tansy was well known as ‚Äúpleasant in taste‚Äù, and he recommends tansy sweetmeats as ‚Äúan especial thing against the gout, if every day for a certain space a reasonable quantitie thereof be eaten fasting.‚Äù In Yorkshire, tansy and caraway seeds were traditionally used in biscuits served at funerals. During the Restoration, a \\"tansy\\" was a sweet omelette flavoured with tansy juice. In the BBC documentary \\"The Supersizers go ... Restoration\\", Allegra McEvedy described the flavour as \\"fruity, sharpness to it and then there's a sort of explosion of cool heat a bit like peppermint.\\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCfx98Ei5lM and //www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCiBMDhs5p0 However, the programme's presenter Sue Perkins experienced tansy toxicity. According to liquor historian A. J. Baime, in the 19th century Tennessee whiskey magnate Jack Daniel enjoyed drinking his own whiskey with sugar and crushed tansy leaf. It can also be used as a substitute for sage. Ethnomedical use For many years, tansy has been used as a medicinal herb despite its toxicity. 19th-century Irish folklore suggests bathing in a solution of tansy and salt as a cure for joint pain. A bitter tea made with tansy flowers has been used for centuries as an anthelmintic to treat parasitic worm infestations, and tansy cakes were traditionally eaten during Lent because it was believed that eating fish during Lent caused intestinal worms. Various Tanacetum species are used ethnomedically to treat migraine, neuralgia and rheumatism and as anthelmintics. Traditionally, tansy was often used for its emmenagogue effects to bring on menstruation or end an unwanted pregnancy, and pregnant women are advised to not use this herb. Research published in 2011 identified 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-DCQA) and axillarin in tansy as antiviral compounds that are active against herpes simplex virus. Among Native Americans The Cherokee use an infusion of the plant for backache, use the plant as a tonic, and wear it around the waist and in shoes to prevent miscarriages.Hamel, Paul B. and Mary U. Chiltoskey 1975 Cherokee Plants and Their Uses -- A 400 Year History. Sylva, N.C. Herald Publishing Co. (p. 58) The Cheyenne use an infusion of the pulverized leaves and blossoms for dizziness and weakness.Grinnell, George Bird 1972 The Cheyenne Indians - Their History and Ways of Life Vol.2. Lincoln. University of Nebraska Press (p. 190). Other uses Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) Some traditional dyers use tansy to produce a golden-yellow color. The yellow flowers are dried for use in floral arrangements. Tansy is also used as a companion plant, especially with cucurbits like cucumbers and squash, or with roses or various berries. It is thought to repel ants, cucumber beetles, Japanese beetles, squash bugs, and some kinds of flying insects, among others. Dried tansy is used by some beekeepers as fuel in a bee smoker.

The Eureka Flag is the war flag flown at the battle of the Eureka Stockade that took place on 3 December 1854 at Ballarat in Victoria, Australia. An estimated crowd of over 10,000 people swore allegiance to the flag as a symbol of defiance at Bakery Hill on 29 November 1854.Justin Corfield, Dorothy Wickham, Clare Gervasoni, The Eureka Encyclopedia (Ballarat Heritage Services, Ballarat, 2004), p. xiii. Over 30 miners were killed at the Eureka Stockade, along with six troopers and police. Some 125 miners were arrested and many others badly wounded. The field is Prussian blue measuring 260 cm √ó 400 cm (2:3.08 ratio) and made from fine woollen fabric. The horizontal cross is 37 cm wide and the vertical cross 36 cm wide. The central star is slightly larger (8.5%) than the others being 65 cm tall from point to point and the other stars 60 cm. The white stars are made from fine cotton lawn and the off-white cross from cotton twill.Dorothy Wickham, Clare Gervasoni, Val D‚ÄôAngri, The Eureka Flag: Our Starry Banner (Ballarat Heritage Services, Ballarat, 2000). It is listed as an object of significance on the Victorian Heritage Register and was designated as a Victorian icon by the National Trust in 2006.National Trust, First Victorian Icons Named History Origin and symbolism Portrait of Henry Ross who some speculate was the designer of the Eureka flag. According to one popular tradition the flag design is credited to a Canadian member of the Ballarat Reform League, 'Captain' Henry Ross of Toronto. In 1885, John Wilson, who was employed by the Victorian Works Department at Ballarat as a foreman, made the claim that he had originally conceptualised the Eureka flag after becoming sympathetic to the rebel cause. He then recalls that it was constructed from bunting by a tarpaulin maker.John Wilson, 'The Starry Banner of Australia', The Capricornian (Rockhampton), 19 December 1885, p. 29 .J.W. Wilson, The Starry Banner of Australia: An Episode in Colonial History (Brian Donaghey, Brisbane, 1963) pp. 6-7. A. W. Crowe recounted in 1893 that \\"it was Ross who gave the order for the insurgents' flag at Darton and Walker's.\\"Ballarat Star, 14 January 1893. Crowe's story is confirmed in as far as there were advertisements that appeared in the Ballarat Times dating from October‚ÄìNovember 1854 for Darton and Walker, manufacturers of tents, tarpaulin and flags, situated at the Gravel Pits. There is also another legend where the flag was sewn by three local women - Anastasia Withers, Anne Duke and Anastasia Hayes. The stars are made of a delicate material which is consistent with the story they were made out of their petticoatsThe Sydney Sun, 5 May 1941, p. 5, refers to this oral tradition. See also Withers in his report in the Ballarat Star, 1 May 1896. and the \\"blue woollen material certainly bears a marked resemblance to the standard dressmaker's length of material for making up one of the voluminous dresses of the 1850s.\\"Anne Beggs Sunter, ‚ÄòContesting the Flag: the mixed messages of the Eureka Flag‚Äô, paper for Eureka Seminar, University of Melbourne History Department, 1 December 2004, published in Eureka: reappraising an Australian Legend, edited by Alan Mayne, Network Books, Perth, 2007. The earliest mention of a flag was the report of a meeting held on 23 October 1854 to discuss indemnifying Andrew McIntyre and Thomas Fletcher who had both been arrested. The article published in The Herald, 7 November 1854 edition, also states that: \\"Mr. Kennedy suggested that a tall flag pole should be erected on some conspicuous site, the hoisting of the diggers' flag on which should be the signal for calling toge-ther a meeting on any subject which might require immediate consideration.\\"The Herald, 07 November 1854. Frank Cayley in his seminal Flag of Stars claims to have found two sketches on a visit to the soon-to-be headquarters of the Ballarat Historical Society in 1963, which may be the original plans for the Eureka flag. One is a two dimensional drawing of the Eureka flag inscribed with the words \\"blue\\" and \\"white\\" to denote the colour scheme and Cayley has concluded: \\"It looks like a rough design of the so-called King Flag.\\"Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars (Rigby, Sydney, 1966), p. 82. The other sketch was \\"pasted on the same piece of card shows the flag being carried by a bearded man\\" that Cayley believes may have been intended as a representation of Henry Ross.Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars (Rigby, Sydney, 1966), pp. 82-83. There has been an expert analysis of the Cayley sketches carried out by Ballarat militaria consultant Paul O'Brien who says: \\"This sketch, once in the collection of the Ballarat Historical Society, location now unknown, was originally displayed with another sketch representing the 'Eureka' or 'King' flag and was labelled 'Found in a Tent After the Affair at Eureka'. The sketches were first reproduced in Frank Cayley's book Flag of Stars (Rigby, 1966). The assumption made in the accompanying text was that the sketch was a draft design for the making of the flag. \\"While this assumption is quite plausible, it would seem more likely that the sketch was made after the capture of the flag. Note the tattered leading edge and indistinct star. The number of points to the stars represented also does not tally with those on the surviving 'King' flag. This sketch was, perhaps, drawn after the flag was 'brought in triumph' to the government camp and while it was being savaged by eager souvenir hunters. \\"The two sketches have been drawn by different hands, and many details of design differ considerably (notably the hoist edge and number of star points). The size of the flag in the sketch with figure does not tally with the enormous size of the 'King' flag, and is probably a later, not contemporary, representation.\\"Bob O‚ÄôBrien, Massacre at Eureka: The untold story (Australian Scholarly Publishing, Kew, 1992), p. 81. Professor Anne Beggs-Sunter mentions an article reportedly published in the Ballarat Times \\"shortly after the Stockade referring to two women making the flag from an original drawing by a digger named Ross. Unfortunately no complete set of the Ballarat Times exists, and it is impossible to locate this intriguing reference.\\"The Sydney Sun, 5 May 1941, p. 4, mentions issues of the Ballarat Times in the Mitchell Library. See also Len Fox, The Eureka Flag, p. 49. The theory that the Eureka flag is based on the Australian Federation Flag has precedents in that \\"borrowing the general flag design of the country one is revolting against can be found in many instances of colonial liberation, including Haiti, Venezuela, Iceland, and Guinea.\\"Whitney Smith, The Flag Book of the United States: The Story of the Stars and Stripes and the Flags of the Fifty States (William Morrow, New York, 1975), 60. There is also a strong resemblance with the Flag of Quebec, where Ross was born. Another possible influence is the blue and white flag featuring a couped cross that flew at the tent where St Alipius chapel was located.Dorothy Wickham, Clare Gervasoni, Val D‚ÄôAngri, The Eureka Flag: Our Starry Banner (Ballarat Heritage Services, Ballarat, 2000), p. 11. Professor Geoffrey Blainey believes that the white cross on which the stars of the Eureka flag are arrayed is \\"really an Irish cross rather than being [a] configuration of the Southern Cross.\\"Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ‚ÄòHistorians discuss Eureka legend‚Äô, Lateline, 7 May 2001 (Geoffrey Blainey). Cayley has stated that the field \\"may have been inspired by the sky, but was more probably intended to match the blue shirts worn by the diggers.\\"Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars (Rigby, Sydney, 1966), 76.Eureka Flag history The number of points on the stars appears to have been a mere convenience as eight would be the easiest to manufacture in the absence of specialised sewing instruments. Oath swearing at Bakery Hill Swearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross by Charles Doudiet. The flag raising ceremony on 29 November 1854 where the oath was sworn at Bakery Hill was not the first flying of the Eureka flag that day. In his open letter to the colonists of Victoria, dated 7 April 1855, Peter Lalor said that upon hearing news of the fracas at the Eureka gold reef involving the military reinforcements that had just arrived, he headed towards Barker and Hunt's store on Specimen Hill where, \\"The 'Southern Cross' was procured and hoisted on the flagstaff belonging to Barker and Hunt; but it was almost immediately hauled down, and we moved down to the holes on the Gravel Pits Flat.\\"Historical Studies: Eureka Supplement, 2nd ed. (Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1965), 35. In his memoirs John Wilson recalled enlisting the help of prisoners to procure the flag pole on Bakery Hill that was 60 ft long and felled from an area known as Byle's Swamp in Bullarook Forest.J.W. Wilson, The Starry Banner of Australia: An Episode in Colonial History (Brian Donaghey, Brisbane, 1963), pp. 7-8. It was then set into an abandoned mineshaft and his design of \\"five white stars on a blue ground, floated gaily in the breeze.\\"J.W. Wilson, The Starry Banner of Australia: An Episode in Colonial History (Brian Donaghey, Brisbane, 1963), p. 8. The Ballarat Times first mentioned the Eureka flag on 24 November 1854 in an article about a meeting of the Ballarat Reform League to be held the following Wednesday where \\"the Australian flag shall triumphantly wave, a symbol of Liberty.\\" There are also other examples of the Eureka flag being referred to at the time as the Australian flag. It was reported in The Age, 28 November 1854 edition, that: \\"The Australian flag shall triumphantly wave in the sunshine of its own blue and peerless sky, over thousands of Australia's adopted sons.\\"Ballarat Times, cited in The Age, 28 November 1854, p. 5. The day after the battle their readers were told: \\"They assembled round the Australian flag, which has now a permanent flag-staff.\\"The Age, 4 December 1854, 5. In a despatch Governor Charles Hotham said: \\"The disaffected miners ... held a meeting whereat the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows offered for its defence.\\"Three Despatches From Sir Charles Hotham (Public Record Office, Melbourne, 1981), pp. 6-7. In the subsequent Ballarat Times report of the oath swearing ceremony it was stated that: \\"During the whole of the morning several men were busily employed in erecting a stage and planting the flagstaff. This is a splendid pole of about 80 feet and straight as an arrow. This work being completed about 11 o'clock, the Southern Cross was hoisted, and its maiden appearance was a fascinating object to behold. There is no flag in Europe, or in the civilised world, half so beautiful and Bakery Hill as being the first place where the Australian ensign was first hoisted, will be recorded in the deathless and indelible pages of history. The flag is silk, blue ground with a large silver cross; no device or arms, but all exceedingly chaste and natural.\\"Ballarat Times, 30 November 1854. Near the base of the flagpole Lalor their elected leader knelt down with his head uncovered, pointed his right hand to the Eureka flag, and swore to the affirmation of his fellow demonstrators: \\"We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.\\"Raffaello Carboni, The Eureka Stockade: The Consequence of Some Pirates Wanting on Quarterdeck a Rebellion (Currey O'Neil, Blackburn, 1980), 68.

In 1932, R. S.

It was also reported the stump \\"has been securely fenced in, and the enclosed area is to be planted with floriferous trees. The spot is adjacent to Eureka, which is famed alike for the stockade fight and for the fact that the Welcome Nugget. (sold for ¬£10,500) was discovered in 1858 within a stone's throw of it.\\"North Western Courier, 13 July 1931. The modern day address of the oath swearing ceremony is likely to be 29 St. Paul's Way, Bakery Hill.

Exhibit in High Treason trials At the Eureka state treason trials that began on 22 February 1855, the 13 defendants had it put to them that they did \\"traitorously assemble together against our Lady the Queen\\" and attempt \\"by the force of arms to destroy the Government constituted there and by law established, and to depose our Lady the Queen from the kingly name and her Imperial Crown.\\"The Queen v Hayes and others, 1. Furthermore, in the relation to the \\"overt acts\\" that constituted the actus reus of the offence, the indictment read: \\"That you raised upon a pole, and collected round a certain standard, and did solemnly swear to defend each other, with the intention of levying war against our said Lady the Queen.\\" Called as a witness in the state treason trials, during examination in chief assistant civil commissary and magistrate, George Webster, testified that upon entering the stockade the besieging forces \\"immediately made towards the flag, and the flag was pulled down by the police.\\"The Queen v Joseph and others, 35. John King testified that: \\"[he] took their flag, the Southern Cross, down - the same flag as now produced.\\"The Sydney Morning Herald, 5 March 1855, p. 3. In his closing submission the defence counsel Henry Chapman argued there were no inferences to be drawn from the hoisting of the Eureka flag, saying: \\"and if the fact of hoisting that flag be at all relied upon as evidence of an intention to depose Her Majesty ... no inference whatever can be drawn from the mere hoisting of a flag as to the intention of the parties, because of the witnesses has said that two hundred flags were hoisted at the diggings; and if two hundred persons on the same spot choose to hoist their particular flag, what each means we are utterly unable to tell, and no general meaning as to hostility to the Government can be drawn from the simple fact that the diggers on that occasion hoisted a flag ... I only throw it out to you because it is utterly impossible, in the multiplicity of flags that have been hoisted on the diggings, to draw an exact inference as to the hoisting of any one particular flag at one spot.\\"The Queen v Joseph and others, 43. Post-battle preservation A modern variation of the Eureka flag was central to the landmark architecture of the Eureka Centre prior to its redevelopment as the Museum of Australian Democracy. The Eureka flag was retained by John King who quit the police force two days after the state treason trials ended to become a farmer. In the late 1870s he eventually settled near Minyip in the Victorian Wimmera district. It was here the Eureka flag \\"made occasional appearances at country bazaars.\\" In his 1870 history of Ballarat, William Withers said he had not been able to find out what had happened to the Eureka flag.William Withers, History of Ballarat, 1870, Appendix E. Professor Anne Beggs-Sunter thinks it is \\"likely that King read Withers's book, because he wrote to the Melbourne Public Library offering to sell the flag to that institution.\\" The head librarian, Marcus Clarke, approached Peter Lalor to authenticate the flag but he was unable asking, \\"Can you find someone whose memory is more accurate than mine?\\"John King's letter to Melbourne Public Library of 13 September 1877 reproduced in Dot Wickham, The Eureka Flag, Our Starry Banner, Ballarat, Ballarat Heritage Services, 2000, p. 44. The library eventually decided not to acquire the flag due to the uncertainty over its origins. It would remain in the custody of the King family for forty years until 1895 when it was lent to the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery (now the Art Gallery of Ballarat). John King's widow Isabella would post the Eureka flag after being approached by gallery president, James Oddie, along with a letter to the secretary which reads: It remained at the gallery in continued obscurity \\"under a cloud of skepticism and conservative disapproval\\"; bits of the flag were cut off and given to visiting dignitaries. Approximately 31% of the original specimen is missing. The flag was \\"re-discovered\\" by Len Fox during the 1940s,Walshe, R. D He Found and Raised Eureka's Trampled Flag: a Tribute to Len Fox but it took decades to convince authorities to properly authenticate the flag. It was found after World War II in a drawer at the gallery, discovered by members of the Australian Communist Party. The final irrefutable validation of its authentication occurred when sketchbooks of Canadian Charles Doudiet were put up for sale at a Christies auction in 1996. Two sketches in particular show the flag design as being the same as the tattered remains of the original specimen that was first put on public display at the Art Gallery of Ballarat in 1973, at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.Justin Corfield, Dorothy Wickham, Clare Gervasoni, The Eureka Encyclopedia (Ballarat Heritage Services, Ballarat, 2004), p. 539-541. The gallery had received a $1,000 grant from the state government to cover half the estimated cost of repairing and mounting the Eureka flag.Ballarat Courier, 14 February 1973, p. 12. In 2001, legal ownership of the flag was transferred to the Art Gallery of Ballarat. There was a second extensive restoration of the Eureka flag undertaken in 2011 by leading textile conservation specialists Artlab Australia. The City of Ballarat had received a permit from heritage Victoria to proceed with the conservation work, and a full assessment of the state of the flag was commissioned. The report compiled by Artlab described the Eureka Flag as \\"arguably the most important historical textile in Australia.\\" The old backing cloth was replaced with state of the art materials that are less prone to deterioration, as was the timber backing board and a new, purpose-built, low light, temperature controlled display case was constructed.My Ballarat, September 2010.Business News, Issue 218, May 2013. The flag was then loaned to the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (MADE) by the gallery in 2013. When MADE closed in 2018, the interpretive centre came under the management of the City of Ballarat. The premises were opened once again to the public in April 2018, with the flag retained as the centrepiece of a visitor experience now branded as the Eureka Centre Ballarat, while remaining part of the gallery collection. Customary use Since the original miners revolt at Eureka, the flag, born out of adversity, has gained wider notability in Australian culture as a symbol of democracy, egalitarianism, and general purpose symbol of protest,Huxley, John Eureka?

Whilst some Australians view the Eureka Flag as a symbol of nationality (see Australian flag debate), it has more often been employed by historical societies, re-enactors and trade unions such as the former Builders Labourers Federation. More recently it has been adopted by right-wing organizations and political parties, including the Australia First Party, National Action and some neo-Nazi groups,Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. 2006.

Depending on their political persuasion, these groups either see it as representative of the miner's efforts to free themselves from political or economic oppression, or their sentiments in favour of restricting non-white immigration and the eventual Chinese poll tax.

In August 1890 a crowd of 30,000 protesters gathered at the Yarra Bank in Melbourne under a platform draped with the Eureka flag in a show of solidarity with maritime workers.W.A. Spence, Australia's Awakening, p. 95, who said the meeting was on 31 August 1890. However in an article for Sydney Daily Telegraph, 14 March 1963 edition, E.J. Holloway states that the platform had been decorated with the Eureka flag on 29 August 1890. See also Len Fox, The Strange Story of the Eureka Flag, p. 17. A similar flag was flown prominently above the camp at Barcaldine during the 1891 Australian shearers' strike.Grantlee Kieza, Sons of the Southern Cross (HarperCollins, Sydney, 2014), p. 301. In 1948 a procession of 3,000 members of the Communist affiliated Eureka Youth League and allied unionists led by a Eureka flag bearer marched through the streets of Melbourne on the occasion of the 94th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade.Anne Beggs Sunter, ‚ÄòContesting the Flag: the mixed messages of the Eureka Flag‚Äô, paper for Eureka Seminar, University of Melbourne History Department, 1 December 2004, published in Eureka: reappraising an Australian Legend, edited by Alan Mayne, Network Books, Perth, 2007. The same year there were headlines in the Argus newspaper stating \\"Police in serious clash with strikers\\" and \\"Battle over Eureka flag\\" arising from a violent clash between about 500 strikers and police during a procession on St Patrick's Day in Brisbane. The marchers were singing \\"It's a Great Day for the Irish\\" and \\"Advance, Australia Fair\\" whilst carrying shamrock shaped anti-government placards and a coffin with the label \\"Trade Unionism.\\" Readers were also told that: \\"Conspicuous in the procession was a Eureka flag, a replica of the flag Peter Lalor's followers carried at the Eureka Stockade in 1854.\\" It was reported that two protesters were injured and five arrested \\"In a fight for the Eureka flag\\" where the \\"strikers resisted, and blows were struck.

In 1979, the Northcote City Council began flying the Eureka Flag from its Town Hall to mark the 125th anniversary of the uprising, and continued until at least 1983. During a 1983 royal tour, a republican supporter informally presented a small Eureka Flag to Diana, Princess of Wales, who did not recognise it. The event prompted a cartoon of the royal couple with Charles, Prince of Wales, observing \\"Mummy will not be pleased.\\" The sesquicentenary of the Eureka Stockade occurred in December 2004, and the Eureka Flag was used extensively during the events that were organised to promote awareness of the occasion. It was flown within each state parliament building in Australia, the federal senate, and most prominently atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson made the Eureka Flag a federal election issue in 2004 saying he did not favour flying it at parliament house to mark the 150th anniversary and that \\"I think people have tried to make too much of the Eureka Stockade ... trying to give it a credibility and standing that it probably doesn't enjoy.\\" The Eureka Flag has been adopted by a variety of organisations, including the City of Ballarat and University of Ballarat, that use stylised versions of the 'Southern Cross' in their official logo. It is used by several trade unions, including the CFMEU and ETU. The Eureka flag flies permanently over the Melbourne Trades Hall. The Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria use the Eureka Flag as their official flag and would seem to be the only 'rightful' and 'correct' user of the flag today. They are the only lobby and interest group representing the rights of Gold Miners and Prospectors in the State of Victoria as the original Eureka Stockade rebellion members were.http://pmav.org.au/ In 2016 the Australia First Party formally adopted a logo featuring the Eureka flag.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-12/anger-over-australia-first-partys- use-of-eureka-flag/7319484 Sporting clubs have also used the flag as a symbol including the Melbourne Victory and Melbourne Rebels. Melbourne Victory supporters adopted it as a club flag for its foundation year in 2004, however it was subsequently briefly banned at A-League games by the Football Federation of Australia, but rescinded in the face of criticism from the Victorian general public. The Football Federation of Australia claimed that the ban was \\"unintentional\\". The crew of HMAS Ballarat wear Eureka Flag insignia on their uniforms. The ship also occasionally flies the Eureka Flag from its mainstay alongside the Australian White Ensign. Standardised design The standardised Eureka flag design. The modern design of the Eureka Flag is an enhanced and different version from the 1854 original with blue key lines around each of five equal stars. It is frequently made in the proportions of 20:13. Although the flag is designed as a representation of the Southern Cross, a constellation located in southern skies and thus only visible to viewers in the southern hemisphere, the stars are arranged differently from the arrangement of stars in the constellation itself. The \\"middle\\" star (Epsilon Crucis) in the constellation is off-centre, and near to the edge of the \\"diamond\\", while the Eureka Flag shows it in the centre. The Eureka Flag is only a stylised version of the more widely known pattern. Derivatives and variants The Roll Up Banner. The Lambing Flat riots was a series of violent anti-Chinese demonstrations that took place in the Burrangong region, in New South Wales, Australia, on the goldfields at Spring Creek, Stoney Creek, Back Creek, Wombat, Blackguard Gully, Tipperary Gully and Lambing Flat (now Young, New South Wales). The miners local vigilante committee was known as the Miner's Protection League. On 30 June 1861, seven hundred miners led by a brass band went about sacking the grog-shops which were havens for thieves before turning their attention to the Chinese section. Most fled, but two Chinese who stayed to fight were killed and 10 others badly injured. There were further incidents throughout 1861, with the Chinese who returned again being set upon. Another large gathering called for 14 July, Bastille Day, was eventually read the riot act and had shots fired over their heads before being dispersed by mounted troopers. The trouble gradually subsided as more soldiers and marines were called in from Sydney. In 1870 the town was renamed in honour of governor Sir John Young. The Lambing Flat banner was painted on a tent-flap, now on display at the Lambing Flat Museum, bearing a Southern Cross superimposed over a St Andrew's cross with the inscription \\"ROLL UP. ROLL UP. NO CHINESE.\\"Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars\\" (Rigby, Adelaide, 1966), p. 88. It has been claimed by some that the banner, which served as an advertisement for a public meeting that presaged the Lambing Flat riots, was intended as a tribute to the Eureka Flag. A red Eureka Flag was used by communists during the late 1970s early 1980s. As the design was little seen and the group using it was on fringe of the communist movement the red Eureka Flag soon disappeared from view. The red Eureka Flag has since been adopted by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. The AMWU, however, has no links to communism and is instead affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. Vintage star spangled Eureka Flag Oath swearing scene from the 1949 motion picture Eureka Stockade featuring the star spangled Eureka flag. According to Whitney Smith, writing in 1975, the Eureka Flag \\"perhaps because of its association with labour riots and a time of political crisis in Australian history, was long forgotten. A century after it was first hoisted, however, Australian authors began to recognise that it had been an inspiration, both in spirit and design, for many banners up to and including the current official civil and state flags of the nation.\\"Whitney Smith, Flags Through the Ages and Across the World (McGraw-Hill, Maidenhead, 1975), p. 78. Prior to the Eureka flag going on permanent display to the public it was often featured with no cross and free floating stars as per the Australian national flag, such as in the 1949 motion picture Eureka Stockade starring Chips Rafferty. Other Eureka flags The disputed first report of the attack on the Eureka Stockade also makes reference to a Union Jack being flown during the battle that was then captured, along with the Eureka flag, by the foot police.'By Express. Fatal Collision at Ballaarat', The Argus (Melbourne), 4 December 1854, p. 5 . The investigation carried out by William Withers in the late nineteenth century revealed that two women, Mrs Morgan and Mrs Oliver, claimed to have sewn a starry flag around the time, but \\"they could not positively identify it as the one flown at Eureka.\\"William Withers, 'The Eureka Stockade Flag', The Ballarat Star, 1 May 1896, 1. John Wilson recalls that the Eureka flag was taken down by Thomas Kennedy at sundown on 2 December 1854 and stored in his tent \\"for safe keeping.\\"J.W. Wilson, The Starry Banner of Australia: An Episode in Colonial History (Brian Donaghey, Brisbane, 1963) pp. 14-15. However, when the military and police arrived the next day in the early hours of the morning the Eureka flag was already flying above the stockade. Frank Cayley has concluded that: \\"Wilson's flag was undoubtedly one of several flags, in various designs, that were made at Eureka.\\"Frank Cayley, Flag of Stars (Rigby, Sydney, 1966), p. 77. His colleague and fellow Eureka investigator, Melbourne journalist Len Fox, has also stated: \\"Flags were popular on the goldfields, and it may well be that among the diggers at Ballarat were smaller (and different) versions of the Eureka flag.\\"Len Fox, Eureka and its flag (Mullaya Publications, Canterbury, 1973), p. 32. With respect to the provenance of the star spangled Eureka Flag, Withers interviewed police officer John McNeil for his report published in the Ballarat Star, 1 May 1896 edition, who recalled a meeting at Bakery Hill where Robert McCandlish \\"unbuttoned his coat and took out and unfurled a light blue flag with some stars on it, but there was no cross on it.\\"William Withers, \\"The Eureka Stockade Flag\\", The Ballarat Star, 1 May 1896, p. 1. Eureka Jack mystery Ray Wenban's rendition of the flag arrangement at the Eureka Stockade. Extract of Argus report, 4 December 1854. Since 2012 various theories have emerged, based on the Argus account of the battle dated 4 December 1854, and an affidavit sworn by Private Hugh King three days later as to a flag being seized from a prisoner captured at the stockade, that a Union Jack, known as the Eureka Jack may also have been flown by the rebels. In his Eureka: The Unfinished Revolution, Peter FitzSimons has stated: \\"In my opinion, this report of the Union Jack being on the same flagpole as the flag of the Southern Cross is not credible. There is no independent corroborating report in any other newspaper, letter, diary or book, and one would have expected Raffaello Carboni, for one, to have mentioned it had that been the case. The paintings of the flag ceremony and battle by Charles Doudiet, who was in Ballarat at the time, depicts no Union Jack. During the trial for high treason, the flying of the Southern Cross was an enormous issue, yet no mention was ever made of the Union Jack flying beneath.\\"Peter Fitzsimons, Eureka: The Unfinished Revolution (Random House Australia, Sydney, 2012), pp. 654 - 655, note 56. Extract of affidavit by Hugh King, 9 December 1854. Hugh King who was with the 40th regiment swore in a signed contemporaneous affidavit that he recalled: \\"... three or four hundred yards a heavy fire from the stockade was opened on the troops and me. When the fire was opened on us we received orders to fire. I saw some of the 40th wounded lying on the ground but I cannot say that it was before the fire on both sides. I think some of the men in the stockade should - they had a flag flying in the stockade; it was a white cross of five stars on a blue ground. - flag was afterwards taken from one of the prisoners like a union jack ‚Äì we fired and advanced on the stockade, when we jumped over, we were ordered to take all we could prisoners...\\"Hugh King, 16 January 1855, Eureka Stockade:Depositions VPRS 5527/P Unit 2, Item 9, Public Record Office Victoria . During the committal hearings for the Eureka rebels there would be another Argus report dated 9 December 1854 stating that two flags had been seized in the following terms: \\"The great topic of interest to-day has been the proceedings in reference to the state prisoners now confined in the Camp. As the evidence of the witnesses in these cases is more reliable information than that afforded by most reports, I shall endeavor to give you an abstract of it.\\" Hugh King had been called upon to give further testimony live under oath in the matter of Timothy Hayes and in doing so went into more detail than in his affidavit, as it was reported the Union Jack like flag was found: \\"... rollen up in the breast of a[n] [unidentified] prisoner. He [King] advanced with the rest, firing as they advanced ... several shots were fired on them after they entered [the stockade]. He observed the prisoner [Hayes] brought down from a tent in custody.\\"'BALLAARAT', The Argus (Melbourne), 9 December 1854, p. 5 . Military historian and author of Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle, Gregory Blake, has conceded the rebels may have flown two battle flags as they were claiming to be defending their British rights. Blake leaves open the possibility that the flag being carried by the prisoner had been souvenired from the flag pole as the routed garrison was fleeing the stockade. Once taken by Constable John King the Eureka flag was placed beneath his tunic in the same fashion as the suspected Union Jack was found on the prisoner. According to The Eureka Encyclopedia, in 1896 Sergeant John McNeil recalled shredding a flag at the Spencer Street Barracks in Melbourne at the time that was said to be the Eureka flag,Justin Corfield, Dorothy Wickham, Clare Gervasoni, The Eureka Encyclopedia (Ballarat Heritage Services, Ballarat, 2004), p. 357. but which Blake believes may have actually been the mystery Eureka Jack.Gregory Blake, Eureka Stockade: A ferocious and bloody battle (Big Sky Publishing, Newport, 2012), pp. 243 - 244, note 78. There is another theory that the Eureka Jack was an 11th hour response to divided loyalties in the rebel camp.Tom Cowie, '$10,000 reward to track down 'other' Eureka flag', The Courier (Ballarat), 22 October 2013, p. 3 . Peter Lalor made a blunder by choosing \\"Vinegar Hill\\" - the site of a battle during the 1798 Irish uprising - as the rebel password. This led to waning support for the Eureka rebellion as news that the issue of Irish independence had become involved began to circulate.H.R.

Great Britain Railways in Great Britain are run under a structure established by the Railways Act 1993 (as amended), which provided for the break-up of the former vertically integrated state railway, the British Railways Board, and the transfer of its operations into the private sector. The Secretary of State for Transport has overall responsibility for the railways within the UK Government. The railway track and infrastructure is owned and operated by Network Rail, which is regulated by the Office of Rail & Road (ORR). In Great Britain, passenger trains are run under either franchises from the Department for Transport, or on an open access basis; which means their operators have no contract with government. Freight train operators have no contracts with government, and rely on the competitiveness and attractiveness of their product and services to maintain and increase their market shares. Rolling stock is primarily owned by rolling stock leasing companies (ROSCOs). In 2006, using powers in the Railways Act 2005, the Department for Transport took over most of the functions of the Strategic Rail Authority. The DfT now itself runs competitions for the award of passenger rail franchises, and, once awarded, monitors and enforces the contracts with the private sector franchisees. Franchises specify the passenger rail services which are to be run, and the quality and other conditions (for example, the cleanliness of trains, station facilities and opening hours, the punctuality and reliability of trains) which the operators have to meet. Some franchises receive subsidy from the DfT for doing so, and some are cash-positive, which means that the franchisee pays the DfT for the contract. Some franchises start life as subsidised and, over the tenure of their franchise period, move to being cash-positive. The other regulatory authority for the privatised railway is the ORR, which, following the Railways Act 2005, is the combined economic and safety regulator. It replaced the Rail Regulator on 5 July 2004. Northern Ireland Unlike the other constituent countries of the United Kingdom, railways in Northern Ireland are a devolved matter. The Northern Ireland Minister for Regional Development has responsibility for railways in Northern Ireland. Even during direct rule, a Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office has always had responsibility for railways in Northern Ireland, and not the Secretary of State for Transport. The structure of the railway industry in Northern Ireland is governed by the Transport Act 1967 (Northern Ireland),http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/apni/1967/capni_19670037_en_1 an Act of the former Parliament of Northern Ireland that still applies. This established a statutory corporation, the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company - which trades under the brand name Translink - whose members are appointed by the Minister for Regional Development. The corporation has established a wholly owned subsidiary, Northern Ireland Railways Company Limited - which trades as NI Railways - to carry out its functions relating to railways. Unlike in Great Britain, where different companies run the network, provide rolling stock, and operate trains, NI Railways carries out all these activities itself in Northern Ireland, and is thus a vertically integrated railway, rather than merely a train operating company. The only exception is the Dublin to Belfast railway line, where services are operated jointly with Iarnr√≥d √âireann, the nationalised railway company in the Republic of Ireland, under the brand name Enterprise.

In addition to describing a particular form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. Since the advent of the industrial era, sprawl has entailed no direct disadvantages, such as the loss of protection from medieval city walls. However, its disadvantages and costs include increased travel time, transport costs, pollution, and destruction of countryside. The cost of building the infrastructure needed for new developments is hardly ever recouped through property taxes, amounting to a huge subsidy for the developers and new residents at the expense of existing property taxpayers. In Continental Europe, the term peri-urbanisation is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, but the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it. For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area, but others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth. The term urban sprawl is highly politicized and almost always has negative connotations. It is criticized for causing environmental degradation, intensifying segregation, and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas and is attacked on aesthetic grounds. The pejorative meaning of the term means that few openly support urban sprawl as such. The term has become a rallying cry for managing urban growth. Definition The term \\"urban sprawl\\" was first used in an article in The Times in 1955 as a negative comment on the state of London's outskirts. Definitions of sprawl vary; researchers in the field acknowledge that the term lacks precision.p. 475. Batty et al. defined sprawl as \\"uncoordinated growth: the expansion of community without concern for its consequences, in short, unplanned, incremental urban growth which is often regarded unsustainable.\\" Bhatta et al. wrote in 2010 that despite a dispute over the precise definition of sprawl there is a \\"general consensus that urban sprawl is characterized by [an] unplanned and uneven pattern of growth, driven by a multitude of processes and leading to inefficient resource utilization.\\" This picture shows the metropolitan areas of the Northeast Megalopolis of the United States demonstrating urban sprawl, including far-flung suburbs and exurbs illuminated at night. Reid Ewing has shown that sprawl has typically been characterized as urban developments exhibiting at least one of the following characteristics: low-density or single-use development, strip development, scattered development, and/or leapfrog development (areas of development interspersed with vacant land). He argued that a better way to identify sprawl was to use indicators rather than characteristics because this was a more flexible and less arbitrary method. He proposed using \\"accessibility\\" and \\"functional open space\\" as indicators. Ewing's approach has been criticized for assuming that sprawl is defined by negative characteristics. What constitutes sprawl may be considered a matter of degree and will always be somewhat subjective under many definitions of the term. Ewing has also argued that suburban development does not, per se constitute sprawl depending on the form it takes, although Gordon & Richardson have argued that the term is sometimes used synonymously with suburbanization in a pejorative way. Metropolitan Los Angeles for example, despite popular notions of being a sprawling city, is the densest major urban area (over 1,000,000 population) in the US, being denser than the New York urban area and the San Francisco urban area. Essentially, most of metropolitan Los Angeles is built at more uniform low to moderate density, leading to a much higher overall density for the entire region. This is in contrast to cities such as New York, San Francisco or Chicago which have extremely compact, high-density cores but are surrounded by large areas of extremely low density. The international cases of sprawl often draw into question the definition of the term and what conditions are necessary for urban growth to be considered sprawl. Metropolitan regions such Greater Mexico City, Delhi National Capital Region and Beijing, are often regarded as sprawling despite being relatively dense and mixed use. Examples According to the National Resources Inventory (NRI), about 8,900 square kilometres (2.2 million acres) of land in the United States was developed between 1992 and 2002. Presently, the NRI classifies approximately 100,000 more square kilometres (40,000 square miles) (an area approximately the size of Kentucky) as developed than the Census Bureau classifies as urban. The difference in the NRI classification is that it includes rural development, which by definition cannot be considered to be \\"urban\\" sprawl. Currently, according to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.6 percent of the U.S. land area is urban.Lubowski, Ruben N.; Marlow Vesterby, Shawn Bucholtz, Alba Baez, and Michael J. Roberts (May 31, 2006). Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2002 . Economic Research Service, . Retrieved on February 7, 2008. Approximately 0.8 percent of the nation's land is in the 37 urbanized areas with more than 1,000,000 population. In 2002, these 37 urbanized areas supported around 40% of the total American population.USA Urbanized Areas: 2000 Ranked by Population. Demographia, August 25, 2002. Retrieved on February 8, 2008. Nonetheless, some urban areas like Detroit have expanded geographically even while losing population. But it was not just urbanized areas in the U.S. that lost population and sprawled substantially. According to data in \\"Cities and Automobile Dependence\\" by Kenworthy and Laube (1999), urbanized area population losses occurred while there was an expansion of sprawl between 1970 and 1990 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Brussels, Belgium; Copenhagen, Denmark; Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, Germany; and Zurich, Switzerland, albeit without the dismantling of infrastructure that occurred in the United States.  Characteristics  Despite the lack of a clear agreed upon description of what defines sprawl most definitions often associate the following characteristics with sprawl.  Single-use development  This refers to a situation where commercial, residential, institutional and industrial areas are separated from one another. Consequently, large tracts of land are devoted to a single use and are segregated from one another by open space, infrastructure, or other barriers. As a result, the places where people live, work, shop, and recreate are far from one another, usually to the extent that walking, transit use and bicycling are impractical, so all these activities generally require a car.Frumkin, Howard (May‚ÄìJune 2002). Urban Sprawl and Public Health. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Retrieved on February 7, 2008. The degree to which different land uses are mixed together is often used as an indicator of sprawl in studies of the subject. According to this criterion, China's urbanization can be classified as \\"high-density sprawl\\", a seemingly self-contradictory term coined by New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe. He explains that despite the high-rise buildings, China's superblocks (huge residential blocks) are largely single-use and surrounded by giant arterial roads, which detach different functions of a city and create an environment unfriendly to pedestrians.  Job sprawl and spatial mismatch  Traffic congestion in sprawling S√£o Paulo, Brazil, which, according to Time magazine, has the world's worst traffic jams. Job sprawl is another land use symptom of urban sprawl and car-dependent communities. It is defined as low-density, geographically spread-out patterns of employment, where the majority of jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city's central business district (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery. It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic freedom of employment location allowed by predominantly car- dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies' desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion. Spatial mismatch is related to job sprawl and economic environmental justice. Spatial mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a reverse commute to the suburbs. Job sprawl has been documented and measured in various ways. It has been shown to be a growing trend in America's metropolitan areas. The Brookings Institution has published multiple articles on the topic. In 2005, author Michael Stoll defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 U.S. Census data. Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser and Elizabeth Kneebone's 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs. These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a radius around the CBD: or less, 3 to , and 10 to . Kneebone's study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3‚Äì10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10‚Äì35 mile ring. This compares to the year 1998 ‚Äì 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings. The study shows CBD employment share shrinking, and job growth focused in the suburban and exurban outer metropolitan rings. Low-density Sprawl is often characterized as consisting of low-density development. The exact definition of \\"low density\\" is arguable, but a common example is that of single family homes on large lots. Buildings usually have fewer stories and are spaced farther apart, separated by lawns, landscaping, roads or parking lots. Specific measurements of what constitutes low-density is culturally relative; for example, in the United States 2‚Äì4 houses per acre might be considered low-density while in the UK 8‚Äì12 would still be considered low-density. Because more automobiles are used much more land is designated for parking. The impact of low density development in many communities is that developed or \\"urbanized\\" land is increasing at a faster rate than the population is growing. Overall density is often lowered by \\"leapfrog development\\". This term refers to the relationship, or lack thereof, between subdivisions. Such developments are typically separated by large green belts, i.e. tracts of undeveloped land, resulting in an average density far lower even than the low density indicated by localized per-acre measurements. This is a 20th and 21st century phenomenon generated by the current custom of requiring a developer to provide subdivision infrastructure as a condition of development.DeGrove, John and Robyne Turner (1991), \\"Local Government in Florida: Coping with Massive and Sustained Growth\\" in Huckshorn, R. (ed.) Government and Politics in Florida. University of Florida Press, Gainesville. Usually, the developer is required to set aside a certain percentage of the developed land for public use, including roads, parks and schools. In the past, when a local government built all the streets in a given location, the town could expand without interruption and with a coherent circulation system, because it had condemnation power. Private developers generally do not have such power (although they can sometimes find local governments willing to help), and often choose to develop on the tracts that happen to be for sale at the time they want to build, rather than pay extra or wait for a more appropriate location. Some research argues that religious ideas about how humans should live (and die) promote low-density development and may contribute to urban sprawl. Conversion of agricultural land to urban use Land for sprawl is often taken from fertile agricultural lands, which are often located immediately surrounding cities; the extent of modern sprawl has consumed a large amount of the most productive agricultural land, as well as forest, desert and other wilderness areas. In the United States the seller may avoid tax on profit by using a tax break exempting like- kind exchanges from capital gains tax; proceeds from the sale are used to purchase agricultural land elsewhere and the transaction is treated as a \\"swap\\" or trade of like assets and no tax is due. Thus urban sprawl is subsidized by the tax code. In China, land has been converted from rural to urban use in advance of demand, leading to vacant rural land intended for future development, and eventual urban sprawl. Housing subdivisions Milton, Ontario. This photograph is an example of Canadian exurban development, though recently attempts are made to reduce this type of development in many major cities. Housing subdivisions are large tracts of land consisting entirely of newly built residences. New Urbanist architectural firm Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company state that housing subdivisions \\"are sometimes called villages, towns, and neighbourhoods by their developers, which is misleading since those terms denote places that are not exclusively residential.\\" They are also referred to as developments. Subdivisions often incorporate curved roads and cul-de-sacs. These subdivisions may offer only a few places to enter and exit the development, causing traffic to use high volume collector streets. All trips, no matter how short, must enter the collector road in a suburban system. Lawn Because the advent of sprawl meant more land for lower costs, home owners had more land at their disposal, and the development of the residential lawn after the Second World War became commonplace in suburbs, notably, but not exclusively in North America. The creation in the early 20th century of country clubs and golf courses completed the rise of lawn culture in the United States. Lawns now take up a significant amount of land in suburban developments, contributing in no small part to sprawl. Commercial developments commercial strips like this one in Breezewood, Pennsylvania are common in outer rural exurbs and suburbs in metropolitan areas. In areas of sprawl, commercial use is generally segregated from other uses. In the U.S. and Canada, these often take the form of strip malls, which refer to collections of buildings sharing a common parking lot, usually built on a high-capacity roadway with commercial functions (i.e., a \\"strip\\"). Similar developments in the UK are called Retail Parks. Strip malls consisting mostly of big box stores or category killers are sometimes called \\"power centers\\" (U.S.). These developments tend to be low- density; the buildings are single-story and there is ample space for parking and access for delivery vehicles. This character is reflected in the spacious landscaping of the parking lots and walkways and clear signage of the retail establishments. Some strip malls are undergoing a transformation into Lifestyle centers; entailing investments in common areas and facilities (plazas, cafes) and shifting tenancy from daily goods to recreational shopping. Walmart Supercenter in Luray, Virginia. Another prominent form of retail development in areas characterized by sprawl is the shopping mall. Unlike the strip mall, this is usually composed of a single building surrounded by a parking lot that contains multiple shops, usually \\"anchored\\" by one or more department stores (Gruen and Smith 1960). The function and size is also distinct from the strip mall. The focus is almost exclusively on recreational shopping rather than daily goods. Shopping malls also tend to serve a wider (regional) public and require higher-order infrastructure such as highway access and can have floorspaces in excess of a million square feet (ca. 100,000 m¬≤). Shopping malls are often detrimental to downtown shopping centres of nearby cities since the shopping malls act as a surrogate for the city centre (Crawford 1992). Some downtowns have responded to this challenge by building shopping centres of their own (Frieden and Sagelyn 1989). Fast food chains are often built early in areas with low property values where the population is expected to boom and where large traffic is predicted, and set a precedent for future development. Eric Schlosser, in his book Fast Food Nation, argues that fast food chains accelerate suburban sprawl and help set its tone with their expansive parking lots, flashy signs, and plastic architecture (65). Duany Plater Zyberk & Company believe that this reinforces a destructive pattern of growth in an endless quest to move away from the sprawl that only results in creating more of it. Effects  Environmental  Urban sprawl is associated with a number of negative environmental outcomes. One of the major environmental problems associated with sprawl is land loss, habitat loss and subsequent reduction in biodiversity. A review by Czech and colleagues finds that urbanization endangers more species and is more geographically ubiquitous in the mainland United States than any other human activity. Urban sprawl is disruptive to native flora & fauna and introduces invasive plants into their environments. Although the effects can be mitigated through careful maintenance of native vegetation, the process of ecological succession and public education, sprawl represents one of the primary threats to biodiversity. Regions with high birth rates and immigration are therefore faced with environmental problems due to unplanned urban growth and emerging megacities such as Kolkata.Fenger, J: 1999, \\"Urban air quality\\", Atmospheric Environment, vol.33, no.29, pp 4877‚Äì4900. Other problems include: * flooding, which results from increased impervious surfaces for roads and parking (see urban runoff) * increased temperatures from heat islands, which leads to a significantly increased risk of mortality in elderly populations. The urban sprawl of Melbourne. At the same time, the urban cores of these and nearly all other major cities in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan that did not annex new territory experienced the related phenomena of falling household size and, particularly in the U.S., \\"white flight\\", sustaining population losses.High-Income World Central City Population Losses. Demographia. Retrieved on February 8, 2008. This trend has slowed somewhat in recent years, as more people have regained an interest in urban living. Due to the larger area consumed by sprawling suburbs compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident. As forest cover is cleared and covered with impervious surfaces (concrete and asphalt) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the groundwater aquifers. This threatens both the quality and quantity of water supplies. Sprawl increases water pollution as rain water picks up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, and other pollutants in runoff from parking lots and roads. The Chicago metro area, nicknamed \\"Chicagoland\\". Gordon & Richardson have argued that the conversion of agricultural land to urban use is not a problem due to the increasing efficiency of agricultural production; they argue that aggregate agricultural production is still more than sufficient to meet global food needs despite the expansion of urban land use. Health  Sprawl leads to increased driving, which in turn leads to vehicle emissions that contribute to air pollution and its attendant negative impacts on human health. In addition, the reduced physical activity implied by increased automobile use has negative health consequences. Sprawl significantly predicts chronic medical conditions and health-related quality of life, but not mental health disorders. The American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion, have both stated that there is a significant connection between sprawl, obesity, and hypertension.McKee, Bradford. \\"As Suburbs Grow, So Do Waistlines \\", The New York Times, September 4, 2003. Retrieved on February 7, 2008. In the years following World War II, when vehicle ownership was becoming widespread, public health officials recommended the health benefits of suburbs due to soot and industrial fumes in the city center. However, air in modern suburbs is not necessarily cleaner than air in urban neighborhoods. In fact, the most polluted air is on crowded highways, where people in suburbs tend to spend more time. On average, suburban residents generate more per capita pollution and carbon emissions than their urban counterparts because of their increased driving. Sprawl also reduces the chance that people will take the bicycle for their commute which would be better for their health.  Safety  A heavy reliance on automobiles increases traffic throughout the city as well as automobile crashes, pedestrian injuries, and air pollution. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of five and twenty-four and is the leading accident-related cause for all age groups.U.S. Death Statistics. The Disaster Center. Retrieved on February 8, 2008. Residents of more sprawling areas are generally at greater risk of dying in a car crash due to increased exposure to driving. Evidence indicates that pedestrians in sprawling areas are at higher risk than those in denser areas, although the relationship is less clear than for drivers and passengers in vehicles. Research covered in the Journal of Economic Issues and State and Local Government Review shows a link between sprawl and emergency medical services response and fire department response delays.  Increased infrastructure/transportation costs  thumb Road Space Requirements Living in larger, more spread out spaces generally makes public services more expensive. Since car usage becomes endemic and public transport often becomes significantly more expensive, city planners are forced to build highway and parking infrastructure, which in turn decreases taxable land and revenue, and decreases the desirability of the area adjacent to such structures. Providing services such as water, sewers, and electricity is also more expensive per household in less dense areas, given that sprawl increases lengths of power lines and pipes, necessitating higher maintenance costs . Residents of low- density areas spend a higher proportion of their income on transportation than residents of high density areas.McCann, Barbara. Driven to Spend . Surface Transportation Policy Project (2000). Retrieved on February 8, 2008. The unplanned nature of outward urban development is commonly linked to increased dependency on cars. In 2003, a British newspaper calculated that urban sprawl would cause an economic loss of 3905 pounds per year, per person through cars alone, based on data from the RAC estimating that the average cost of operating a car in the UK at that time was ¬£5,000 a year, while train travel (assuming a citizen commutes every day of the year, with a ticket cost of 3 pounds) would be only ¬£1095. \\"Is your car worth it?\\", The Guardian, Guardian Media Group, February 15, 2003.

Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors, while sprawl creates barriers. Sprawl tends to replace public spaces with private spaces such as fenced-in backyards. Critics of sprawl maintain that sprawl erodes quality of life. Duany and Plater-Zyberk believe that in traditional neighborhoods the nearness of the workplace to retail and restaurant space that provides cafes and convenience stores with daytime customers is an essential component to the successful balance of urban life. Furthermore, they state that the closeness of the workplace to homes also gives people the option of walking or riding a bicycle to work or school and that without this kind of interaction between the different components of life the urban pattern quickly falls apart. James Howard Kunstler has argued that poor aesthetics in suburban environments make them \\"places not worth caring about\\", and that they lack a sense of history and identity.Kunstler, James Howard. Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-First century. Touchstone, 1998 Urban sprawl has class and racial implications in many parts of the world; the relative homogeneity of many sprawl developments may reinforce class and racial divides through residential segregation. Numerous studies link increased population density with increased aggression. Some people believe that increased population density encourages crime and anti-social behavior. It is argued that human beings, while social animals, need significant amounts of social space or they become agitated and aggressive. However, the relationship between higher densities and increased social pathology has been largely discredited.  Debate  According to Nancy Chin, a large number of effects of sprawl have been discussed in the academic literature in some detail; however, the most contentious issues can be reduced \\"to an older set of arguments, between those advocating a planning approach and those advocating the efficiency of the market.\\" Those who criticize sprawl tend to argue that sprawl creates more problems than it solves and should be more heavily regulated, while proponents argue that markets are producing the economically most efficient settlements possible in most situations, even if problems may exist. However, some market-oriented commentators believe that the current patterns of sprawl are in fact the result of distortions of the free market. Chin cautions that there is a lack of \\"reliable empirical evidence to support the arguments made either for or against sprawl.\\" She mentions that the lack of a common definition, the need for more quantitative measures \\"a broader view both in time and space, and greater comparison with alternative urban forms\\" would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions and conduct more fruitful debates. Arguments opposing urban sprawl include concrete effects such as health and environmental issues as well as abstract consequences including neighborhood vitality. American public policy analyst Randal O'Toole of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has argued that sprawl, thanks to the automobile, gave rise to affordable suburban neighborhoods for middle class and lower class individuals, including non- whites. He notes that efforts to combat sprawl often result in subsidizing development in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods while condemning and demolishing poorer minority neighborhoods.  Groups that oppose sprawl  The American Institute of Architects, American Planning Association, and Smart Growth America recommend against sprawl and instead endorses smart, mixed-use development, including buildings in close proximity to one another that cut down on automobile use, save energy, and promote walkable, healthy, well- designed neighborhoods.Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities.

Consumer preference  One of the primary debates around suburban sprawl is the extent to which sprawl is the result of consumer preference. Some, such as Peter Gordon, a professor of planning and economics at the University of Southern California's School of Urban Planning and Development, argue that most households have shown a clear preference for low- density living and that this is a fact that should not be ignored by planners. Gordon and his frequent collaborator, Harry Richardson have argued that \\"The principle of consumer sovereignty has played a powerful role in the increase in America‚Äôs wealth and in the welfare of its citizens. Producers (including developers) have responded rapidly to households‚Äô demands. It is a giant step backward to interfere with this effective process unless the benefits of intervention substantially exceed its cost.\\" They argue that sprawl generates enough benefits for consumers that they continue to choose it as a form of development over alternative forms, as demonstrated by the continued focus on sprawl type developments by most developers. However, other academics such as Reid Ewing argue that while a large segment of people prefer suburban living that does not mean that sprawl itself is preferred by consumers, and that a large variety of suburban environments satisfy consumer demand, including areas that mitigate the worst effects of sprawl. Others, for example Kenneth T. Jackson have argued that since low-density housing is often (notably in the U.S.A.) subsidized in a variety of ways, consumers' professed preferences for this type of living may be over-stated. Automobile dependency A majority of Californians live, commute, and work in the vast and extensive web of Southern California freeways. Whether urban sprawl does increase problems of automobile dependency and whether conversely, policies of smart growth can reduce them have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The study has been criticised for its methodologyMindali, O., Raveh, A. and Salomon, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162. but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar. Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.Cervero, R. and Gorham, R.. Commuting in Transit Versus Automobile Neighborhoods Journal of the American Planning Association 61, 2: 210‚Äì225, 1995 This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behavior. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behavior, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence. Those not opposed to low density development argue that traffic intensities tend to be less, traffic speeds faster and, as a result, ambient air pollution is lower. (See demographia's report.) Kansas City, Missouri is often cited as an example of ideal low-density development, with congestion below the mean and home prices below comparable Midwestern cities. Wendell Cox and Randal O'Toole are leading figures supporting lower density development. Longitudinal (time-lapse) studies of commute times in major metropolitan areas in the United States have shown that commute times decreased for the period 1969 to 1995 even though the geographic size of the city increased.US Commuting Travel Times Down Over Quarter Century.

Other studies suggest, however, that possible personal benefits from commute time savings have been at the expense of environmental costs in the form of longer average commute distances,Cervero, R. and Wu, K, (1997) K.

Transport Policy 18 (1) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth measures to counteract urban sprawl. Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use. These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states: Ceteris paribus, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.  Risk of increased housing prices  There is also some concern that anti- sprawl policies will increase housing prices.

Retrieved on February 8, 2008.  Proposed alternatives  Many critics concede that sprawl produces some negative externalities; however there is some dispute about the most effective way to reduce these negative effects. Gordon & Richardson for example argue that the costs of building new public transit is disproportionate to the actual environmental or economic benefits, that land use restrictions will increase the cost of housing and restrict economic opportunity, that infill possibilities are too limited to make a major difference to the structure of American cities, and that the government would need to coerce most people to live in a way that they do not want to in order to substantially change the impact of sprawl. They argue that the property market should be deregulated to allow different people to live as they wish, while providing a framework of market based fees (such as emission fees, congestion charging or road pricing) to mitigate many of the problems associated with sprawl such as congestion and increased pollution. Alternative development styles Early attempts at combatting urban sprawl The Metropolitan Green Belt first proposed by the London County Council in 1935. Starting in the early 20th century, environmentalist opposition to urban sprawl began to coalesce, with roots in the garden city movement, as well as pressure from campaign groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE). Under Herbert Morrison's 1934 leadership of the London County Council, the first formal proposal was made by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee \\"to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space\\". It was again included in an advisory Greater London Plan prepared by Patrick Abercrombie in 1944. The Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 expressly incorporated green belts into all further national urban developments. New provisions for compensation in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts. The first urban growth boundary in the U.S. was in Fayette County, Kentucky in 1958.Kolakowski, K., P. L. Machemer, J. Thomas, and R. Hamlin. 2000.

Available online at: http://www.ippsr.msu.edu/Publications/ARUrbanGrowthBound.pdf  Contemporary anti-sprawl initiatives  Many Canadian cities feature numerous pockets of high density throughout even their most distant suburbs. As a result, some Canadian suburbs have skylines that rival large American cities. Pictured is Burnaby, British Columbia. The term 'smart growth' has been particularly used in North America. The terms 'compact city' or 'urban intensification' are often used to describe similar concepts in Europe and particularly the UK where it has influenced government policy and planning practice in recent years. The state of Oregon enacted a law in 1973 limiting the area urban areas could occupy, through urban growth boundaries. As a result, Portland, the state's largest urban area, has become a leader in smart growth policies that seek to make urban areas more compact (they are called urban consolidation policies). After the creation of this boundary, the population density of the urbanized area increased somewhat (from 1,135 in 1970 to 1,290 per km¬≤ in 2000). Although the growth boundary has not been tight enough to vastly increase density, the consensus is that the growth boundaries have protected great amounts of wild areas and farmland around the metro area. Much San Francisco Bay Area has also adopted urban growth boundaries; 25 of its cities and 5 of its counties have urban growth boundaries. Many of these were adopted with the support and advocacy of Greenbelt Alliance, a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization. In other areas, the design principles of District Regionalism and New Urbanism have been employed to combat urban sprawl. The concept of circular flow land use management has been developed in Europe to reduce land take by urban sprawl through promoting inner-city and brownfield development. Although cities such as Los Angeles are well known for sprawling suburbs, policies and public opinion are changing. Transit-oriented development, in which higher-density mixed-use areas are permitted or encouraged near transit stops is encouraging more compact development in certain areas-particularly those with light and heavy rail transit systems. Bicycles are the preferred means of travel in many countries. Also, bicycles are permitted in public transit. Businesses in areas of some towns in which bicycle use is high are thriving. Bicycles and transit contribute in two important ways toward the success of businesses: * Firstly, people living the closest to these business districts on average have more money to spend locally because they spend less their cars. * Secondly, because such people rely more on bicycling, walking, and transit than on driving, they tend to focus more of their commerce on locally-owned neighborhood businesses that are convenient for them to reach. Walkability is a measure of how friendly an area is to walking. Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits. However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many subjective factors.S. Reid, \\"Fit for purpose: evaluating walkability\\", Engineering Sustainability, Vol. 161, No. 2, June 2008, pp.105‚Äì112. Factors influencing walkability include the presence or absence and quality of footpaths, sidewalks, or other pedestrian right-of- ways, traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility, and safety, among others. Walkability is an important concept in sustainable urban design.

She was named after the Battle of Solebay which took place in 1672 between an Anglo-French force and the Dutch Navy during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Solebay was built by R. & W.

History Solebay was intended to join the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet, but the war against Japan ended while Solebay was working up in the Mediterranean, and so she returned to Home Waters. She subsequently became Captain (D), or leader, of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet which was based in the United Kingdom. Solebay also took part in Operation Deadlight, the large-scale destruction of the German U-boat fleet, and which resulted in over one hundred of the boats being sunk in a variety of ways. In June 1953, Solebay was involved in the 1953 Fleet Review at Spithead, which took place in celebration of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Solebay was positioned in the middle of her sister ships and .Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden In July that year, Solebay was placed in Reserve with the rest of her flotilla. In 1957, Solebay returned to active service, becoming Captain (D) of the 1st Destroyer Squadron, which saw service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1959, while still part of that squadron, Solebay deployed to the Far East. While there, tragedy struck her sister-ship, , which had collided with the Indian light cruiser . Solebay, along with another sister-ship, towed the heavily damaged Hogue to a nearby base. After returning home in 1960, Solebay subsequently saw service once more in the Mediterranean, when she and the rest of the 1st Destroyer Squadron deployed to that region to relieve the 5th Destroyer Squadron. During this deployment Solebay accidentally rammed her sister-ship , leader of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, while at Malta, delaying that Squadron's departure from the Mediterranean. While there, Solebay acted as escort for the royal yacht , carrying Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, who were visiting Italy on a state visit. Solebay subsequently joined the Home Fleet. She once more joined up with the yacht Britannia and the Queen in November‚ÄìDecember 1961, when Solebay formed part of the escort during the Queen's visit to West Africa. Decommissioning and disposal In 1962, Solebays eventful career came to an end, when she was decommissioned and placed on the disposal list, becoming the Harbour Training Ship, being based at Portsmouth. She arrived at Troon for breaking up on 11 August 1967.

Well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey from the early 20th century and Louis L'Amour from the mid-20th century. The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the popularity of televised Westerns such as Bonanza. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside a few west American states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books. History Pre-1850s The predecessor of the western in American literature emerged early with tales of the frontier. The most famous of the early 19th-century frontier novels were James Fenimore Cooper's five novels comprising the Leatherstocking Tales. Cooper's novels were largely set in what was at the time the American frontier: the Appalachian Mountains and areas west of there. As did his novel The Prairie (1824), most later westerns would typically take place west of the Mississippi River. 1850s‚Äì1900 The Western as a specialized genre got its start in the \\"penny dreadfuls\\" and later the \\"dime novels\\". Published in June 1860, Malaeska; the Indian Wife of the White Hunter is considered the first dime novel. These cheaply made books were hugely successful and capitalized on the many stories that were being told about the mountain men, outlaws, settlers, and lawmen who were taming the western frontier. Many of these novels were fictionalized stories based on actual people, such as Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp (who was still alive at the time), Wild Bill Hickok, and Jesse James. 1900s‚Äì1930s By 1900, the new medium of pulp magazines helped to relate these adventures to easterners. Meanwhile, non-American authors, like the German Karl May, picked up the genre, went to full novel length, and made it hugely popular and successful in continental Europe from about 1880 on, though they were generally dismissed as trivial by the literary critics of the day. Popularity grew with the publication of Owen Wister's novel The Virginian (1902) and especially Zane Grey's Riders of the Purple Sage (1912). The first Hopalong Cassidy stories by Clarence Mulford appeared in 1904, both as dime novels and in pulp magazines. When pulp magazines exploded in popularity in the 1920s, Western fiction greatly benefited (as did the author Max Brand, who excelled at the western short story). Pulp magazines that specialised in Westerns include Cowboy Stories, Ranch Romances, Star Western, West, and Western Story Magazine. The simultaneous popularity of Western movies in the 1920s also helped the genre. 1940s‚Äì1960s In the 1940s several seminal Westerns were published, including The Ox-Bow Incident (1940) by Walter van Tilburg Clark, The Big Sky (1947) and The Way West (1949) by A.B. Guthrie, Jr., and Shane (1949) by Jack Schaefer. Many other Western authors gained readership in the 1950s, such as Ray Hogan, Louis L'Amour, and Luke Short. The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on television. The burnout of the American public on television Westerns in the late 1960s seemed to have an effect on the literature as well, and interest in Western literature began to wane. = Western comics = Western novels, films and pulps gave birth to Western comics, which were very popular, particularly from the late 1940s until circa 1967, when the comics began to turn to reprints. This can particularly be seen at Marvel Comics, where Westerns began circa 1948 and thrived until 1967, when one of their flagship titles, Kid Colt Outlaw (1949‚Äì1979), ceased to have new stories and entered the reprint phase. Other notable long-running Marvel Western comics included Rawhide Kid (1955‚Äì1957, 1960‚Äì1979) Two-Gun Kid (1948‚Äì1962), and Marvel Wild Western (1948‚Äì1957). DC Comics published the long-running series All-Star Western (1951‚Äì1961) and Western Comics (1948‚Äì1961), and Charlton Comics published Billy the Kid (1957‚Äì1983) and Cheyenne Kid (1957‚Äì1973). Magazine Enterprises' Straight Arrow ran from 1950 to 1956, and Prize Comics' Prize Comics Western ran from 1948 to 1956. Fawcett Comics published a number of Western titles, including Hopalong Cassidy from 1948 to 1953. They also published comics starring actors known for their Western roles, including Tom Mix Western (1948‚Äì1953) and Gabby Hayes Western (1948‚Äì1953). Similarly, Dell Comics published Roy Rogers comics from 1948 to 1961, and Magazine Enterprises published Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid from 1949 to 1955. The popular Western comic strip Red Ryder was syndicated in hundreds of American newspapers from 1938 to 1964. 1970s and 1980s In the 1970s, the work of Louis L'Amour began to catch hold of most western readers and he has tended to dominate the western reader lists ever since. George G. Gilman also maintained a cult following for several years in the 1970s and 1980s. Larry McMurtry's and Cormac McCarthy's works remain notable. Specifically, McMurtry's Lonesome Dove and McCarthy's Blood Meridian (both published in 1985) are recognized as major masterpieces both within and beyond the genre. Elmer Kelton, mostly noted for his novels The Good Old Boys and The Time it Never Rained, was voted by the Western Writers of America as the \\"Best Western Writer of All Time\\". Early in the 1970s Indiana novelist Marilyn Durham wrote two popular Western novels, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing and Dutch Uncle. Western readership as a whole began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s. A partial exception was an innovation, the so-called \\"adult western\\". As one practitioner puts it, \\"What's an Adult Western? It's a western novel with sex in it. That's right, the cowboy has sex with women. A new idea? Probably not, but heretofore this had not been seen in western novels (certainly not by Max Brand, Zane Grey, Owen Wister or Louis L'Amour). What these books actually showed was that men and women really did have sex in the old west. (Back when I started the series a rigidly traditional western writer of my acquaintance insisted to me that \\"women did not have orgasms in the old west.\\").\\" 1990s and 2000s Readership of western fiction reached a new low in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and most bookstores, outside a few western states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books. Nevertheless, several Western fiction series are published monthly, such as The Trailsman, Slocum, Longarm and The Gunsmith; these are all \\"adult westerns\\". The genre has seen the rumblings of a revival, and 2008 saw the publication of an all-Western short story magazine Great Western Fiction which was published by Dry River Publishing in Colorado. Nevertheless, the magazine was short-lived and folded after only two issues.\\"Great Western Fiction Has Folded,\\" The Tainted Archive (August 31, 2008). Organizations Western authors are represented by the Western Writers of America, who present the annual Spur Awards and Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement. The organization was founded in 1953 to promote the literature of the American West. While the founding members were mostly western fiction writers, the organization began getting a number of other members from other backgrounds such as historians, regional history buffs, and writers from other genres. Western Fictioneers, founded in 2010, is a professional writers' group that encourages and promotes the traditional Westerns. It is the only professional writers' organization composed entirely of authors who have written Western fiction. Fans of the genre may join as patron members. The Western Fictioneers' annual Peacemakers competition awards prizes in many categories of Western writing.

Co-written by Mikhail Papava, Andrei Konchalovsky and an uncredited Tarkovsky, it is based on Vladimir Bogomolov's 1957 short story Ivan (). The film features child actor Nikolai Burlyayev along with Valentin Zubkov, Evgeny Zharikov, Stepan Krylov, Nikolai Grinko, and Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush. Ivan's Childhood tells the story of orphaned boy Ivan, whose parents were killed by the invading German forces, and his experiences during World War II. Ivan's Childhood was one of several Soviet films of its period, such as The Cranes Are Flying and Ballad of a Soldier, that looked at the human cost of war and did not glorify the war experience as did films produced before the Khrushchev Thaw. In a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky stated that in making the film he wanted to \\"convey all [his] hatred of war\\", and that he chose childhood \\"because it is what contrasts most with war.\\" Ivan's Childhood was Tarkovsky's first feature film. It won him critical acclaim and made him internationally known. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962 and the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1962. The film was also selected as the Soviet entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 36th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Famous filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman, Sergei Parajanov and Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski praised the film and cited it as an influence on their work. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot The film is mainly set at the front during World War II, where the Soviet army is fighting the invading German Wehrmacht. The film features a non-linear plot with frequent flashbacks. After a brief dream sequence, Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call \\"Number 51 at Headquarters\\" and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivan‚Äôs mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov. Burning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the Maly Trostenets extermination camp (which he mentions that he has seen). A subplot involves Captain Kholin and his aggressive advances towards a pretty army nurse, Masha, and Galtsev's own undeclared and probably shared feelings for her. Much of the film is set in a room where the officers await orders and talk, while Ivan awaits his next mission. On the walls are scratched the last messages of doomed prisoners of the Germans. Finally, Kholin and Galtsev ferry Ivan across the river late at night. He disappears through the swampy forest. The others return to the other shore after cutting down the bodies of two Soviet scouts hanged by the Germans. The final scenes then switch to Berlin under Soviet occupation after the fall of the Third Reich. Captain Kholin has been killed in action. Galtsev finds a document showing that Ivan was caught and hanged by the Germans. As Galtsev enters the execution room, a final flashback of Ivan's childhood shows the young boy running across a beach after a little girl in happier times. The final image is of a dead tree on the beach. Cast *Nikolai Burlyaev as Ivan Bondarev *Valentin Zubkov as Capt. Kholin *Evgeny Zharikov as Lt. Galtsev *Stepan Krylov as Cpl.

The film is based on the 1957 short story Ivan () by Vladimir Bogomolov, which was translated into more than twenty languages. It drew the attention of the screenwriter Mikhail Papava, who changed the story line and made Ivan more of a hero. Papava called his screenplay Second Life (, ). In this screenplay Ivan is not executed, but sent to the concentration camp Majdanek, from where he is freed by the advancing Soviet army. The final scene of this screenplay shows Ivan meeting one of the officers of the army unit in a train compartment. Bogomolov, unsatisfied with this ending, intervened and the screenplay was changed to reflect the source material. Mosfilm gave the screenplay to the young film director Eduard Abalov. Shooting was aborted and the film project was terminated in December 1960, since the first version of the film drew heavy criticism from the arts council, and the quality was deemed unsatisfactory and unusable. In June 1961 the film project was given to Tarkovsky, who had applied for it after being told about Ivan's Childhood by cinematographer Vadim Yusov. Work on the film resumed in the same month. The film was shot for the most part near Kanev at the Dnieper River. Tarkovsky continued his collaboration with cinematographer Vadim Yusov, who was the cameraman in Tarkovsky's diploma film The Steamroller and the Violin. Nikolai Burlyayev had played a role in Andrei Konchalovsky's student film The Boy and the Pigeon. Konchalovsky was a friend and fellow student of Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), and thus Burlyayev was also cast for the role of Ivan. He had to pass several screen tests, but according to Burlyayev it is unclear whether anyone else auditioned for the role. Burlyayev would later play Boriska in Tarkovsky's second feature, Andrei Rublev. Responses Ivan in a destroyed village. Broken timber beams look like they are cutting into the picture and toward the main character. Ivan's Childhood was one of Tarkovsky's most commercially successful films, selling 16.7 million tickets in the Soviet Union. Tarkovsky himself was displeased with some aspects of the film; in his book Sculpting in Time, he writes at length about subtle changes to certain scenes that he regrets not implementing. However, the film received numerous awards and international acclaim on its release, winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It attracted the attention of many intellectuals, including Ingmar Bergman who said, \\"My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle. Suddenly, I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had, until then, never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease.\\" Jean-Paul Sartre wrote an article on the film, defending it against a highly critical article in the Italian newspaper L'Unita written by Alberto Moravia and saying that it was one of the most beautiful films he had ever seen. In a later interview, Tarkovsky (who did not consider the film to be among his best work) admitted to agreeing with Moravia's criticisms at the time, finding Sartre's defense \\"too philosophical and speculative\\". Filmmakers Sergei Parajanov and Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski praised the film and cited it as an influence on their work. Ivan's Childhood has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews, and an average rating of 8.91/10.The website's critical consensus states,\\"Ostensibly an atypical Tarkovsky work (less than 100 minutes!), Ivan's Childhood carries the poetry and passion that would characterize the director from here on\\".https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ivans_childhood Film restoration In 2016 the film was digitally restored. The newest version was highly praised by The Independent who called it \\"The most lyrical war movie ever made pristinely restored\\".

It occurs abundantly in coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean, from Argentina northward to North Carolina.  Description  As both common names imply, these squid have elongate, cylindrical bodies with a length to width ratio of 7:1. The arms are in contrast short and weak; the two tentacles are somewhat less than the mantle length. The rhombus-shaped fins are large, up to about 50 percent of the mantle length. Running the ventral length of the mantle is a noticeable ridge. The squid are a reddish orange colour with a large complement of chromatophores. The suckers of the arms possess blunt teeth. On the meaty ends (clubs) of the tentacles, there are four rows of suckers; the inner two (mesial) rows are three times as large as the outer two (marginal) rows. The larger suckers have horny rings with up to 45 teeth. These squid reach a maximum mantle length of 33 centimetres in males and 22 centimetres in females. Sexual dimorphism is apparent, with the left ventral arm in males modified into a hectocotylus; this is used to facilitate fertilization during mating. Males also have a number of purple stripes running lengthwise on the ventral side of the mantle; along with other visual cues produced by chromatophores, these stripes are used in elaborate courtship displays.  Ecology  Due to their abundance, slender inshore squid are important to both commercial and subsistence fisheries. During the annual summer mating season, the squid congregate in large numbers near shore. During the austral summer in waters off Brazil, annual catches may reach 763 metric tonnes. While there may be safety in their numbers, the squid are an important prey item for large fish such as tuna and sharks and a number of cetaceans: pygmy killer whales, orcas, Atlantic spotted dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins are all known predators of slender inshore squid. Other predators include South African and Antarctic fur seals. The squid prey upon several species of estuarine fish, including: killifish, mosquitofish and mollies. Small crustaceans such as grass shrimp are also taken. References * Vecchione, M., E. Shea, S. Bussarawit, F. Anderson, D. Alexeyev, C.-C. Lu, T. Okutani, M. Roeleveld, C. Chotiyaputta, C. Roper, E.

Early life Bargeld left school prior to completion, and is self-taught. He experimented with audio equipment as a teenager, including the disassembling of tape recorders. The first album that he owned was by Pink Floyd, but he quickly moved on to German krautrock acts such as Kraftwerk, Neu! and Can, which he described as his biggest influences at the time. Bargeld is from the Tempelhof area of West Berlin and he moved out of his parents' home in the late 1970s. A 2008 documentary featured him visiting his mother and talking to her about his childhood and the relationship that he had with his parents.\\"Mein Leben ‚Äì Blixa Bargeld\\" (Documentary Film directed by Birgit Herdlitschke, ZDF / ARTE, Germany 2008) Career In 1980, Bargeld founded the group Einst√ºrzende Neubauten (\\"Collapsing New Constructions\\"). Bargeld spoke of the early days of Neubauten in 2010: > The starting point for Neubauten was more that we didn't have anything, so I > didn't really have the choice to say 'I am doing this, I am doing that, or > maybe I should play organ'. I didn't have any of these things, and I could > not afford any of these things, and neither could anybody else in the group. > It was more of the logical consequence of what can we obtain, and that's how > it turned out. It certainly didn't start out as an artistic concept to say > \\"let's do something different\\", it started as an extension of the live > situation as it already was. From 1983 to 2003, Bargeld was a guitarist and backing vocalist with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He also sang lead vocals with Cave on several songs, such as \\"The Carny\\" and \\"The Weeping Song\\". Cave first saw Bargeld performing with Einst√ºrzende Neubauten on TV while the Birthday Party, Cave's band at the time, were touring in Amsterdam. He described the music as \\"mournful\\", Bargeld as looking \\"destroyed\\", and his screams as: \\"a sound you would expect to hear from strangled cats or dying children.\\"EN: 20 ans de Nostalgie Bargeld played guitar on the Gun Club song \\"Yellow Eyes\\" from their 1987 album Mother Juno.Mother Juno album sleeve. He also played on the album Novice by Alain Bashung in 1989. Since the mid-1990s, Bargeld has appeared live with his solo Rede/Speech Performances. During these performances, usually supported by Neubauten's sound engineer Boris Wilsdorf, he works with microphones, sound effects, overdubbing with the help of sampler loops and speaks English or German. The performed pieces include a vocal creation of the DNA of an angel and a parody of a techno song. In 2007, Bargeld started a collaborative project with Alva Noto (a.k.a. Carsten Nicolai) called ANBB, an abbreviation of Noto's and Bargeld's initials. An EP, Ret Marut Handshake, was released on 26 June 2010, followed later that year by a full-length album, Mimikry. In June 2013, Bargeld collaborated with Italian composer Teho Teardo for an album called Still Smiling, which was released on the Specula record label. A music video for the song \\"Mi Scusi\\" was created and an Italian tour was scheduled. In early October 2014, Neubauten announced 24 November 2014 as the release date for their next album, Lament, described as a \\"concept album based on a live performance and installation commissioned by the Flemish city of Diksmuide, Belgium to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War in 1914.\\" Bargeld explained in the official press release: \\"The Second World War is nothing but the elongation of the first one ‚Ä¶ As a child of the post Second World War era, and the resulting division of Germany and Berlin, I‚Äôm of course hugely influenced in my upbringing about the results of that.\\" Bargeld explained in October 2014 that Neubauten is essentially a materialistic band, leading them to employ two scientific researchers to seek out material to support the development of Lament after the album received financial backing in August 2013. The band opened their 2014 European tour in support of Lament with a performance in Diksmuide, Belgium. Style and influences Jennifer Shryane, in her book Blixa Bargeld and Einst√ºrzende Neubauten: German Experimental Music. Evading do-re-mi (2011), explores how the themes and threads of Bargeld's work with Neubauten show even greater variation and experimentation in his performance work outside of the band. For example, the range extends from his surreal, electronic Dadaist-cabaret Rede and collaborations with Alva Noto to his expert direction of Coetzee‚Äôs Warten auf die Barbaren (Waiting for the Barbarians) for the Salzburg Festival in 2005, where he employed multi-layered symbolism through an ice-white setting and an interplay of voices, screams and noise. Shryane‚Äôs book examines Bargeld's vocal strategies and his trademark scream (describing it in dance terms as an endless pirouette or unanticipated giant leap) and the labyrinthine concerns of his texts through Artaudian performance theory (The Theatre and its Double, 1938). She also stresses Bargeld‚Äôs passionate stance on the socializing aspects of music (√† la John Cage), citing his comment on Grundst√ºck that \\"it‚Äôs the social aspects which are important for me.\\" Instruments Bargeld's guitars of choice are a Fender Jaguar and a Fender Mustang, as seen on the concert DVD God Is In The House and at various media appearances. Initially he used a battered H√∂fner Model 173 and a red H√∂fner Colorama II until they \\"broke down.\\" After his effect pedals were stolen in the early 1980s, he relied exclusively on the Fender floating/dynamic tremolo (like the H√∂fner units), which both raise and lower pitch, along with Fender Twin amplifiers, metal slides and changing his amp settings for each individual song to create a unique guitar sound. Personal life Bargeld is married to Chinese- American mathematician Erin Zhu. The couple has a daughter. Together they developed the concept of web-based fan subscriptions as a new business model for musicians. The couple is featured among 37 other design and media figures in the 2010 book Designing Media by designer and IDEO co-founder Bill Moggridge. The couple resides in San Francisco, Beijing and Berlin. Bargeld was a vegetarian for 30 years, but stopped as a result of difficulties that he encountered while practicing vegetarianism in China. He was a smoker for a long period, but quit in the early 2000s. The sound of Bargeld smoking a cigarette is a part of Einst√ºrzende Neubauten's song \\"Silence Is Sexy\\" (2000), which is featured on the Silence Is Sexy studio album.

Flateyjarb√≥k is an important medieval Icelandic manuscript. It is also known as GkS 1005 fol. and by the Latin name Codex Flateyensis. It was commissioned by J√≥n H√°konarson and produced by the priests and scribes J√≥n √û√≥r√∞arson and Magn√∫s √û√≥rhallsson.  Description  Flateyjarb√≥k is the largest medieval Icelandic manuscript, comprising 225 written and illustrated vellum leaves. It contains mostly sagas of the Norse kings as found in the Heimskringla, specifically the sagas about Olaf Tryggvason, St. Olaf, Sverre, H√°kon the Old, Magnus the Good, and Harald Hardrada. But they appear here expanded with additional materialSuch as Nornagests √æ√°ttr (\\"the Story of Norna-Gest\\"), Styrbjarnar √æ√°ttr Sv√≠akappa (\\"Tale of Styrbj√∂rn the Swedish Champion\\"), Hr√≥a √æ√°ttr heimska (\\"The Tale of Roi the Fool\\") and V√∂lsa √æ√°ttr (\\"the Tale of the Phallos\\"). not found elsewhere (some of it being very old) along with other unique differences. Most‚Äîbut not all‚Äîof the additional material is placed within the royal sagas, sometimes interlaced. Additionally, the manuscript contains the only copy of the eddic poem Hyndlulj√≥√∞, a unique set of annals from creation to 1394, and many short tales not otherwise preserved such as Nornagests √æ√°ttr (\\"the Story of Norna Gest\\"). Especially important is the Gr≈ìnlendinga saga (\\"History of the Greenlanders\\"), giving an account of the Vinland colony with some differences from the account contained in Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a (\\"History of Eir√≠k the Red\\"). Here also are preserved the only Icelandic versions of the Orkneyinga saga (\\"History of the Orkney Islanders\\") and F√¶reyinga saga (\\"History of the Faroe Islanders\\").  History  From internal evidence the book was being written in 1387 and was completed in 1394 or very soon after. The first page states that its owner is \\"Jonn Hakonar son\\" and that the book was scribed by two priests. One of them, \\"Jon prestr √û√≥r√∞ar son\\", scribed the contents from the tale of Eir√≠k the Traveller down to the end of the two Olaf sagas and the other, \\"Magn√∫s prestr Thorhallz sun\\", scribed the earlier and later material and also drew the illustrations. Further material was inserted towards the end of the 15th century. The manuscript first received special attention by the learned in 1651 when Bishop Brynj√≥lfur Sveinsson of Sk√°lholt, with the permission of King Frederick III of Denmark, requested all folk of Iceland who owned old manuscripts to turn them over to the Danish king, providing either the original or a copy, either as a gift or for a price. Jon Finnsson, who resided on Flatey ('Flat Island') in the fjord of Brei√∞afj√∂r√∞ur on the northwest coast of Iceland, was then the owner of the book which was already known as the Flateyjarb√≥k. At first Jon refused to release his precious heirloom, the biggest and best book in all of Iceland, and he continued to refuse even when Bishop Brynj√≥lfur paid him a personal visit and offered him five hundreds of land. Jon only changed his mind and bestowed the book on the bishop just as the bishop was leaving the region. The manuscript was given as a present from Bishop Brynj√≥lfur to King Frederick III in 1656, and placed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen. In 1662, the bishop presented the king with a second medieval manuscript, the Codex Regius (Konungsb√≥k eddukv√¶√∞a). It and Flateyjarb√≥k survived the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 and the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 and were eventually repatriated to Iceland in 1971 as Icelandic national treasures. They are preserved and studied by the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies.

In 396 BC, she became the first woman in history to win at the ancient Olympic Games. Early life Cynisca was born around 440 BC in the ancient Greek city of Sparta and was the daughter of the Eurypontid king of Sparta, Archidamus II, and Eupoleia. She was also the sister of the later king of Sparta, Agesilaus II. She is said to have been a tomboy, an expert equestrian and very wealthy, the perfect qualifications for a successful trainer. She was exceedingly ambitious to succeed at the Olympic Games and the first woman to breed horses and win an Olympic victory, according to Pausanias.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 3.8.1-3. Her name means 'female puppy' in Ancient Greek. She was named after her grandfather Zeuxidamus, who was called Cyniscos.Herod, vi 7 It is possible that this name related to a specific kind of dog in Sparta, the female bloodhounds which were famous for their ability to find their quarries by their scent. Olympic Games While most women in the ancient Greek world were kept in seclusion and forbidden to learn any kind of skills in sports, riding or hunting, Spartan women by contrast were brought up from girlhood to excel at these things so as to produce strong children, by going through early training similar to that of their brothers. The ancient Olympic Games were almost entirely male-only and women were forbidden even to set foot in the main stadium at Olympia, where running events and combat sports were held. Women were allowed to enter only the equestrian events, not by running but by owning and training the horses. Cynisca employed men and entered her team at the Olympics, where it won in the four-horse chariot racing (tethrippon Greek: œÑŒ≠Œ∏œÅŒπœÄœÄŒøŒΩ) twice, in 396 BC and again in 392 BC. The irony is that she probably didn't see her victories. According to Xenophon, she was encouraged to breed horses and compete in the Games, by her brother Agesilaus II, in an attempt to discredit the sport. He viewed success in chariot racing as a victory without merit, which was only a mark of wealth and lavish outlay due to the involvement of the horses' owner, while in the other events the decisive factor was a man's bravery and virtue.Xenophon, Minor Works, Agesilaus 9.1 ¬ß6.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Agesilaus 20.1 By having a woman win, he hoped to show the sport to be unmanly, but Cynisca's victories did not stop wealthy Spartans engaging in the sport. However, Cynisca was honored by having a bronzePausanias, Description of Greece, 5.12.5. statue of a chariot and horses, a charioteer and a statue of herself in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, by the side of the statue of Troilus, made by Apelleas, and an inscription written declaring that she was the only female to win the wreath in the chariot events at the Olympic Games.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 6.1.6. The first person in the inscription indicates that Cynisca was willing to push herself forward and Xenophon says that this inscription was Agesilaus' idea. In addition to this, a hero-shrine of Cynisca was erected in Sparta at Plane-tree Grove,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 3.15.1. where religious ceremonies were held. Only Spartan kings were graced in this way and Cynisca was the first woman to receive this honor. The inscription from Olympia (c. 390-380 BC) reads:IvO 160 :English :Kings of Sparta are my father and brothers :Kyniska, victorious with a chariot of swift-footed horses, :have erected this statue. I declare myself the only woman :in all Hellas to have won this crown. :Apelleas son of Kallikles made it. :Ancient Greek : Culture Cynisca's win in the Olympics had a great impact on the ancient Greek world as other women, not only Lacedaemonians, later won the chariot racing, including Euryleonis, Belistiche, Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione, Timareta, Theodota (both from Elis) and Cassia. However, none of them was more distinguished for their victories than she was. Zoe Karelli, a modern Greek poet, wrote a poem for Cynisca's love for the horses and her Olympic win which made her name famous in Greek history. This Spartan princess is frequently used until today as a symbolic figure of the social rise of woman. Her Hero-shrine was placed near the Platanistas, where violent contests were held for boys aged 18‚Äì20, suggesting that as well as being celebrated among women, she was popular among men as well, as the location of her shrine suggests that young men were the focus of her cult. Upon her death, she was treated as a woman with heroic qualities, though not herself a bona fide heroine.

Generally, standard time agrees with the local mean time at some meridian that passes through the region, often near the center of the region. Historically, the concept was established during the 19th century to aid weather forecasting and train travel. Applied globally in the 20th century, the geographical areas became extended around evenly spaced meridians into time zones which (usually) centered on them. The standard time set in each time zone has come to be defined in terms of offsets from Universal Time. In regions where daylight saving time is used, that time is defined by another offset, from the standard time in its applicable time zones. The adoption of standard time, because of the inseparable correspondence between time and longitude, solidified the concepts of halving the globe into an eastern and western hemisphere, with one prime meridian (as well its opposite International Date Line) replacing the various prime meridians that had previously been used. History of standard time During the 19th century, scheduled steamships and trains required time standardization in the industrialized world. Great Britain A standardized time system was first used by British railways on December 1, 1847, when they switched from local mean time, which varied from place to place, to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). It was also given the name railway time reflecting the important role the railway companies played in bringing it about. The vast majority of Great Britain's public clocks were standardized to GMT by 1855. North America Telegraphic equipment used to transmit standard time from the Allegheny Observatory Until 1883, each United States railroad chose its own time standards. The Pennsylvania Railroad used the \\"Allegheny Time\\" system, an astronomical timekeeping service which had been developed by Samuel Pierpont Langley at the University of Pittsburgh‚Äôs Allegheny Observatory (then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Instituted in 1869, the Allegheny Observatory's service is believed to have been the first regular and systematic system of time distribution to railroads and cities as well as the origin of the modern standard time system. By 1870 the Allegheny Time service extended over 2,500 miles with 300 telegraph offices receiving time signals. However, almost all railroads out of New York ran on New York time, and railroads west from Chicago mostly used Chicago time, but between Chicago and Pittsburgh/Buffalo the norm was Columbus time, even on railroads such as the PFtW&C; and LS&MS;, which did not run through Columbus. The Santa Fe Railroad used Jefferson City (Missouri) time all the way to its west end at Deming, New Mexico, as did the east‚Äìwest lines across Texas; Central Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads used San Francisco time all the way to El Paso. The Northern Pacific Railroad had seven time zones between St. Paul and the 1883 west end of the railroad at Wallula Jct; the Union Pacific Railway was at the other extreme, with only two time zones between Omaha and Ogden.October 1883 Travelers Official Guide In 1870, Charles F. Dowd proposed four time zones based on the meridian through Washington, DC for North American railroads.Charles F. Dowd, A.M., Ph.D.; a narrative of his services ..., ed. Charles North Dowd, (New York: Knickerbocker Press, 1930) In 1872. he revised his proposal to base it on the Greenwich meridian. Sandford Fleming, a Scottish-born engineer operating in Canada, proposed worldwide Standard Time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8, 1879. Cleveland Abbe advocated standard time to better coordinate international weather observations and resultant weather forecasts, which had been coordinated using local solar time. In 1879 he recommended four time zones across the contiguous United States, based upon Greenwich Mean Time. The General Time Convention (renamed the American Railway Association in 1891), an organization of US railroads charged with coordinating schedules and operating standards, became increasingly concerned that if the US government adopted a standard time scheme it would be disadvantageous to its member railroads. William F. Allen, the Convention secretary, argued that North American railroads should adopt a five-zone standard, similar to the one in use today, to avoid government action. On October 11, 1883, the heads of the major railroads met in Chicago at the Grand Pacific Hotel and agreed to adopt Allen's proposed system. The members agreed that on Sunday, November 18, 1883, all United States and Canadian railroads would readjust their clocks and watches to reflect the new five-zone system on a telegraph signal from the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh at exactly noon on the 90th meridian.W. F. Allen, \\"History of the movement by which the adoption of standard time was consummated\\", Proceedings of the American Metrological Society [not Meteorological] 4 (1884) 25‚Äì50, Appendix 50‚Äì89. Hathi Trust Digital Library.Michael O'Malley, Keeping Watch: A History of American Time (NY 1990) chapter three Although most railroads adopted the new system as scheduled, some did so early on October 7 and others late on December 2. The Intercolonial Railway serving the Canadian maritime provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia just east of Maine decided not to adopt Intercolonial Time based on the 60th meridian west of Greenwich, instead adopting Eastern Time, so only four time zones were actually adopted by U.S./Canadian railroads in 1883. Major American observatories, including the Allegheny Observatory, the United States Naval Observatory, the Harvard College Observatory, and the Yale University Observatory, agreed to provide telegraphic time signals at noon Eastern Time. Standard time was not enacted into US law until the 1918 Standard Time Act established standard time in time zones; the law also instituted daylight saving time (DST). The daylight saving time portion of the law was repealed in 1919 over a presidential veto, but was reestablished nationally during World War II.Congressional Research Service. (2007). \\"Daylight Saving Time\\". (Report RS22284)). Originally published by wikileaks. In 2007 the US enacted a federal law formalizing the use of Coordinated Universal Time as the basis of standard time, and the role of the Secretary of Commerce (effectively, the National Institute of Standards and Technology) and the Secretary of the Navy (effectively, the U.S. Naval Observatory) in interpreting standard time.21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007, Section 3013. H.R. 2272: 110th CONGRESS House Bills, January 4, 2007. In 1999, standard time was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category \\"National: Technical Innovations.\\"North America Railway Hall of Fame: Inductee - Standard Time  Standard Time inducted into North America Railway Hall of Fame, 1999 The Dominion of Newfoundland, whose capital St. John's falls almost exactly midway between the time zones of Atlantic Time Zone and Greenland Time Zone, voted to create a half-hour time zone known as the Newfoundland Time Zone; it is set at GMT-3:30.  The Netherlands  In the Netherlands, introduction of the railways made it desirable to create a standard time. On 1 May 1909, Amsterdam Time or Dutch Time was introduced. Before that, time was measured in different cities and in the east of the country, this was a few minutes before than in the west. In 1909, a national time was introduced which was the same as the local time in Amsterdam, to be precise the exact time of the Wester Tower (Westertoren/4¬∞53'01.95\\" E). This time was indicated as GMT +0h 19m 32.13s until 17 March 1937, after which it was simplified to GMT+0h20m. This time zone was also known as the Loenen time or Gorinchem time, as this was the exact time in both Loenen and Gorinchem. At noon in Amsterdam, it was 11:40 in London and 12:40 in Berlin. The shift to the current Central European Time zone took place on 16 May 1940. The German occupiers ordered the clock to be moved an hour and forty minutes forward. This time was kept in summer and winter throughout 1941 and 1942. It was only in November 1942 that a different Winter time was introduced, and the time was adjusted one hour backwards. This lasted for only three years; after the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, Summer time was abolished for over thirty years, so during those years, standard time was 40 minutes ahead of the original Amsterdam Time. As of 2017, the Netherlands is in line with Central European Time (GMT+1 in the winter, GMT+2 in the summer, which is significantly different from Amsterdam Time).  New Zealand  In 1868, New Zealand was the first country in the world to establish a nationwide standard time. A telegraph cable between New Zealand's two main islands became the instigating factor for the establishment of \\"New Zealand time\\". In 1868, the Telegraph Department adopted \\"Wellington time\\" as the standard time, across all their offices, so that opening and closing times could be synchronised. The Post Office, which usually shared the same building followed suit. However protests that time was being dictated by one government department, led to a resolution in parliament to establish a standard time for the whole country. The director of the Geological Survey, James Hector, selected New Zealand time to be at the meridian 172¬∞ 30'. This was very close to the country's mean longitude and exactly hours in advance of Greenwich Mean Time. It came into effect on 2 November 1868. For over fifty years, the Colonial Time Service Observatory in Wellington, determined the correct time each morning. At 9 a.m. each day, it was transmitted by morse code to post offices and railway stations around the country. In 1920, radio time signals began broadcasting, greatly increasing the accuracy of the time nationwide.

She is the First Child and pilot of a giant mecha named Evangelion Unit 00. At the beginning of the series, Rei is an enigmatic figure whose unusual behavior astonishes her peers. As the series progresses, she becomes more involved with the people around her, particularly her classmate and fellow Eva pilot, Shinji Ikari. She is revealed to be a key factor in the events that conclude the storyline. Her role in the conclusion is not made entirely clear in the TV series, but is one of the principal plot points of the 1997 film The End of Evangelion. Hideaki Anno, director of the animated series, conceived her as a representation of his unconscious. He was also influenced by his personal readings on psychology, in particular on Freudian psychoanalysis, taking inspiration from Freud's theories on the Oedipus complex. Other influences for its creation include earlier works by Gainax staff members, such as Aoki Uru. Rei is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese, and by Amanda Winn-Lee, Brina Palencia and Ryan Bartley in English. Rei has been well-received by critics and in reviews. She has maintained a high ranking in every popularity poll of the series and has also appeared in polls to decide the most popular anime characters in Japan. Reviewers have praised Rei's mysterious aura, and her role in the story. Merchandising based on her has also been released, particularly action figures, which became highly popular. Critics attributed her success to a series of moe traits that proved hugely popular with anime fans, influencing the creation of several subsequent female anime characters. Conception 300x300px Like many of Evangelions characters, Ayanami's surname comes from a Japanese World War II naval vessel, the . Her first name comes from the character Rei Hino of the anime and manga series Sailor Moon. This was done to get one of Sailor Moons directors, Kunihiko Ikuhara, to work on Evangelion, however, it failed. Written in kanji can also mean \\"zero\\", \\"nullity\\" and is a pun on her Evangelion 00. Hideaki Anno instructed Yoshiyuki Sadamoto on Rei's character design saying, \\"Whatever else, she needs to be painted in as a bitterly unhappy young girl with little sense of presence.\\" The band Kinniku Sh≈çjo Tai's theme song Doko e demo ikeru kitte and its line \\"hotai de masshiro na shojo\\" (lit. \\"the white girl with bandages\\") inspired Sadamoto to draw Rei. Ukina, a character from Sadamoto's previous work Koto served as Rei's model. Anno required a \\"cool character with short hair\\" and designed Rei originally as a brunette with dark eyes; however, it was necessary to distinguish her from the other female protagonist Asuka Langley Soryu, so Sadamoto designed her with eye and hair colors opposite to those of Asuka. While Asuka was conceived as \\"an idol-like figure\\" in Neon Genesis Evangelion and a symbol of \\"heterosexual desire\\", Sadamoto designed Rei as a \\"mother figure\\", thinking of her as \\"the Yin opposed to Asuka\\". Anno also suggested that Rei's eye color be red, a feature he believed would give her more personality and distinguish her design from those of the other characters. Her hair color also changed to blue after the main character from Aoki Uru, the movie sequel to The Wings of Honneamise which was never made. 250x250px As with many other Evangelion characters, he transposed some aspects of his life into her character, including the choice to not eat meat and maintain a vegetarian diet. He also took inspiration from Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic concepts and the Oedipus complex in particular, since \\"there was this replacement by a robot, so the original mother is the robot, but then there is a mother of the same age, Rei Ayanami, by [Shinji's] side, who's also by the side of the real father\\". In a discarded draft of Rei's character background, Rei was a more sensual character than her final version. Sadamoto, unlike the more frank and explicit Hideaki Anno, decided to give her a much more \\"enigmatic\\" and bland eros. During Evangelions production and first broadcast, Anno encountered many difficulties with her character, not feeling \\"particularly interested\\" or relating to her. To better delineate her characterization and psychology, he thought her as his own unconscious, \\"trying to put aside my presuppositions, trying to bring out the most primitive, the most core, the purest parts within me\\". In the fifth episode, explicitly dedicated to her character, Rei speaks only seven lines and fifty-two words, while in the sixth she has twenty-five lines. For a long time he forgot to \\"explore Rei's personality\\", completely ignoring it or giving it very marginal space. For example, in episode eight she does not appear in any scene, while in episode seven he \\"finally remembered her\\" giving Rei a brief appearance in one shot. After many episodes he wanted to focus on her and \\"explore her emotion\\", adding Rei's stream of consciousness-like monologue in episode 14. When Anno was working on the monologue, he wanted to develop her in a \\"schizophrenic\\" direction and wondered how to portray a kind of madness. He was loaned a magazine-like book entitled on mental illness that contained a poem by someone who suffered from a mental disorder, and that triggered his imagination. In the twenty-first episode, the first Rei clone, killed by Naoko Akagi in the final version of the script, would eventually survive after being strangled and having lost consciousness momentarily, awakening in an empty command room without Dr. Akagi.Original script from Evangelion Original III. During the production, Ikuhara, annoyed by the idealized image and the fetishism that some fans built around the character, proposed to Anno that they \\"betray\\" fans and show her as a real girl who gets married and \\"gets pregnant in the last episode\\", but Anno rejected the suggestion. Anno himself declared he considered her character \\"already finished\\" in the episode six smile scene: \\"In short, if she and Shinji completely 'communicated' there, then isn‚Äôt she over with? At that moment, Rei, for me, was finished.\\"  Voice  Megumi Hayashibara voices Rei both in the original animated series and in the 1997 movies Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion and the new Rebuild of Evangelion. In 1995, Ogata said she was somewhat \\"surprised\\" by her role and her laconic and introverted character saying, \\"I have to challenge something new.\\" According to Hayashibara, before Neon Genesis Evangelion there were few taciturn and cold characters to deal with, so, in the absence of examples to imitate, she tried to characterize her \\"as best I could\\". During the dub sessions, Hideaki Anno instructed and guided her, advising her to read her lines in the flattest tone possible: \\"When the director explained her character to me, he said, 'It's not that Rei doesn't have any feelings, it's just that she doesn't understand'.\\" According to Hayashibara, since Rei \\"doesn't know emotion, there's no difference between what she says and feels\\". Apparently, her \\"great beauty\\" comes from \\"this surface, not without depth, but with the absence of its necessity\\". She added, \\"Rei's beauty comes from the truth that she has feelings\\", and \\"when I found the warmth below the coldness in her words, I synchronized with Rei for the first time\\". With Rei's role, Hayashibara's popularity as a voice actor grew, and she became an icon of anime fandom. Appearances Neon Genesis Evangelion Rei Ayanami's birth date is never specified in the original series. She was born in Laboratory for Artificial Evolution's third branch, a place located under the lake Ashino and Hakone city. Her body with albino-like traits is created in absolute secrecy from the salvaged remains of Yui Ikari,From the Glossary chapter of the official Japanese End of Evangelion pamphlet, also known as Red Cross Book. a brilliant researcher who loses her life in a testing experiment by Evangelion Unit 01. In the deepest level of the headquarters of a special agency named Nerv, many Rei clones are kept, so that when one Rei dies, she can be replaced. When a clone is activated from a level named Terminal Dogma, although she remains characteristically distinct from all former incarnations, she is endowed with the soul of a being called Lilith, the second Angel. In 2010, her legal guardian Gendo Ikari brought her first clone (Rei I) to the Gehirn base, the predecessor of Nerv and responsible for the development and construction of the first Evangelion units, introducing her as the daughter an acquaintance had entrusted to him. This first Rei is killed by Dr. Naoko Akagi, colleague and secret lover of Gend≈ç. During her visit to Gehirn, Rei I gets lost in the laboratory control room and meets Naoko, calling her an \\"old hag\\", as if to provoke her. She then reveals that it was actually Gendo who called Naoko that. Naoko suddenly recognizes Yui's facial features in the little girl's face and in an outburst of violence, she strangles and kills her, after which she commits suicide. Following the death of the first Rei, a second clone is activated, which moved to the first municipal middle school of the new city of Tokyo-3 in 2014. Officially, Rei II is chosen by an organization called the Marduk Institute as the First Child and pilot of Eva Unit-00 to defeat the Angels. Through the course of the series, Rei, who is originally completely submissive to the will of Gendo, becomes friends with fellow Eva pilot and classmate Shinji Ikari. She also begins to become more aware of her own identity and desires. In the battle with the Angel Armisael, Rei II decides to sacrifice herself alongside Eva Unit-00 to save Shinji and destroy the enemy. After her sacrifice, Rei II is replaced by a third and final clone, suitably covered with bandages to conceal the truth. All the other bodies in Terminal Dogma are later destroyed by Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, Naoko's daughter. The third Rei acts as the main catalyst behind an apocalyptic event named Third Impact. Thanks to her close relationship with Shinji, the last Rei decides to rebel against Gendo's will. She merges with Lilith, letting Shinji freely decide the course of Instrumentality, during which all of mankind unites into one collective consciousness. A giant white and unclothed Rei emerges into open space, holding Shinji's Eva-01. When Shinji finally rejects Instrumentality, this figure disintegrates. Rebuild of Evangelion Rei returns as a primary character in Rebuild of Evangelion and first appears in the first installment of the saga, Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone (2007). Her character remains virtually identical to the anime, acting as a pilot of Evangelion Unit-00 and helping Shinji defeat Angel Ramiel. In the second movie, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance (2009), her character develops and her relationship with Shinji is shown much more openly than in the original series. In a departure from her original traits, she attempts to host a dinner party for her fellow pilots. Anno first thought to use this idea for the fourth episode of the original anime, but the proposal was shelved during the production of the series. During the climax, Angel Zeruel devours Rei and Unit-00. When Unit-01 goes out of control, Shinji forces his way into the angel and pulling her out and the two embrace each other. At the end of the film, they are both trapped within Unit-01 as the act triggers the Third Impact. In the third installment Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo (2012), the same Rei does not appear; a different clone is introduced instead, who acts and thinks very differently than the other Rei, consistently maintaining a cold and silent demeanor. In other media In the official Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, written and drawn by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, further differences are evident in the characterization of Rei. In the manga, she is generally more empathetic and open to human contact compared to her animated counterpart. In the comic, moreover, the character has more space than Asuka, who in the anime, under the influence of Hideaki Anno, has a predominant role. Compared to the classic series, Sadamoto tried to tread his hand on her relationship with Shinji, particularly insisting on the symbology of the touch of the hands and the theme of motherhood, inspired by Kazuo Umezu's The Drifting Classroom.From the interview to Sadamoto from the CUT magazine, December 2014. As in the series, she at first considers herself empty and useless, created solely for piloting the Evangelion under Ikari's orders; Shinji's touch, however, changes his attitude. In a scene from the fifth volume of the manga where they are both at Rei's house, Rei gets burned while preparing tea with Shinji and their hands touch for a moment. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Rei invites Shinji to speak to his father and open up to him; in another chapter, thinking back to that moment, she wonders if her hands will one day be able to touch Shinji again. During the clash with the Angel Armisael, Rei becomes increasingly aware of her feelings of sadness and affection towards Shinji, towards whom she demonstrates a certain romantic interest. In a scene from the last episode of the animated series, a parallel universe is presented with a different story than the previous episodes; in the alternate reality, Rei is presented as a girl who has just moved into the class of Asuka and Shinji, with a radically different personality: cheerful, distracted and irascible. An outgoing Rei is featured in some Neon Genesis Evangelion spin-offs, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days, set in the alternate reality of the last episode. In the original web anime series Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, a parody of the original animated series, three Ayanami sisters are presented. The eldest, Ayanami, is diligent and introverted; the second, Supone, is sport oriented and extroverted; and the younger, Chibinami, is a four years old girl with a passion for soft toys. Also in the light novel Evangelion Anima by Ikuto Yamashita several Rei appear; Rei Troi, pilot of an Eva called Evangelion Unit-02 Type II Allegorica, Rei Quatre and Rei Cinq and seven-year- old version Rei Six , all of them pilots of Evangelion-0.0 units. In addition to various video games based on the original animated series, Rei has appeared in media not related to the Evangelion franchise, such as Monster Strike, Super Robot Wars, Tales of Zestiria, Puzzle & Dragons, Keri hime sweets, Summons Board, Puyopuyo!! Quest, Line Rangers, Unison, MapleStory, Valkyrie Connect, Ragnarok Online, The Battle Cats and in an official Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion crossover episode.  Characterization and themes  Rei Ayanami is a taciturn and shy girl who limits her personal relations as much as possible and mechanically executes any order given to her, even if particularly cruel. She is extremely introverted, socially detached and laconic. Sociologist Satomi Ishikawa noted that, in a scene from the sixth episode of the series, her companion Shinji asks her the reason that pushes her to want to pilot Evangelion 00, to which Rei replies saying she finds her only \\"bond\\" with other people in this, thus demonstrating that she is committed to the struggle against angels, not by choice or idealism. Throughout the series, she has dropped hints of her indifference to living and has engaged in drastic acts that could have cost her her life. Writer Justin Wu (The Artifice) noted that, unlike other characters, she does not care if she dies and embraces death \\"as if death is the only way to prove that she has lived\\". For the critic Gerald Alva Miller, Rei experiences numerous internal conflicts, feelings of alienation, existential anguish and a deep sense of loneliness. According to Evangelion character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, she is \\"translucent\\", like a shadow or \\"the air\\": \\"The kind of girl you can't touch. The girl you long for, but there is nothing about her that you can grab a hold onto.\\" He also described Asuka and Rei as \\"such strong characters, in their own separate ways\\". Some critics have linked her silent and inexpressive personality to alexithymia or a schizoid personality disorder. In the twelfth episode, she states she does not deem it necessary to write a will and reveals she is a vegetarian. During the series it is suggested that she does not have a menstrual cycle. Gualtiero Cannarsi, who cured the Italian adaptation for the series, described Rei as a girl \\"unaware of the most basic rules of life and hygiene\\", as she has had no one to teach them to her, resulting in her being completely disinterested in them. Her attitude is reflected in her apartment, where hygiene is neglected. In one episode Ritsuko Akagi says, like Commander Ikari, she \\"is not very adept at living\\". Scattered on the floor of his apartment are several scientific texts on biological interactions and genetics written in Latin and the original edition of The Happy Prince and Other Tales (in the Rebuild of Evangelion series). Critic Susan J. Napier also noted that, in the last two episodes, she confesses to wanting to die and \\"go back to nothing\\". According to director Hideaki Anno, Rei, being aware of the fact that \\"there'll be another to replace her\\" if she dies, does not appreciate her own life, hurts herself and feels she does not need friends: \\"Her presence, her existence‚Äîostensible existence‚Äîis ephemeral. She's a very sad girl. She only has the barest minimum of what she needs to have.\\" Anno also understands the Japanese national attraction to characters like Rei as the product of a stunted imaginative landscape born of Japan's defeat in the Second World War, because \\"since that time, the education we received is not one that creates adults\\". ≈åizumi Mitsunari, in a long interview with Hideaki Anno, compared the figure of Rei to the many girls committed to the Japanese sect Aum Shinriky≈ç, particularly popular during the years of the first broadcast of Evangelion, as \\"completely dependent on their guru\\" Sh≈çk≈ç Asahara. An official Death and Rebirth booklet describes her as \\"an expressionless noh mask\\" and \\"a girl who does not dream\\". According to her voice actress, Amanda Winn-Lee, despite the cold and detached appearance, there is still \\"a small spark of humanity\\" in Rei, \\"clouded by this huge sense of negative self-worth and the realization that she is expendable\\". She also stated: \\"She knows she's expendable, but the thing is, she's still human.\\" According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Rei is perfectly capable of feeling emotions and feelings, but has great expressive and communicative difficulties. From the first episodes of the series, Shinji tries to connect with her, however, Rei is unable to parse the meaning of his words and actions adequately. Although the two pilots occasionally converse with each other, they cannot communicate on an emotional level and do not understand their own feelings. However, facing a crying Shinji, who is glad that she is alive after a big fight in the sixth episode, she smiles, marking one of her most significant moments of character development. After this, both their words and actions move to a place of mutual understanding. In one of the first scenes of the Evangelion anime, Shinji sees what appears to be a ghost of Rei Ayanami in a deserted city near Neo Tokyo-3. The Rei visible in the sequence is not real; the appearance is connected to the scenario of the film The End of Evangelion, released in 1997 as a conclusion to the classic series. During the course of the film, all forms of life come together in one being during the Instrumentality; human beings, shortly before dying, see Rei's ghosts appear, guiding them in the process as \\"messengers of redemption\\".Evangelion Carddass Masters G: P-R1. According to Y≈´ichir≈ç Oguro, editor of some of the contents of the Japanese home video editions of Evangelion, the Rei ghost Shinji sees on the avenue is \\"the existence that gazes upon man\\", and the scene symbolizes that \\"Shinji is protected by his mother since the beginning of the series\\". Patrick Drazen and Dani Cavallaro noted that like other Neon Genesis Evangelion characters who have traits of some deities of Shinto mythology, Rei has some affinities with the goddess of the Sun, Amaterasu, who is reborn at every dawn. They also compared the show's two other protagonists, Shinji and Asuka, with Susanoo and Ama-no-Uzume, respectively; Shinji, like Susanoo, acts clumsily and is not accepted by society, while Asuka, like Uzume, is sensual and flaunts her body. According to Italian scholar Fabio Bartoli, her three incarnations could be linked to the three evolutionary stages of the soul postulated by the Jewish Qabbalah‚ÄîNephesh (the mere animal vitality), Ruach (the normal human soul) and Neshamah (the elevated spirit, after the connection between man and God). Often her image is flanked by that of the Moon, a celestial body associated with motherhood, pallor, passivity and femininity. Japanese engineer Yumiko Yano noted a hieratic and unattainable aura in Rei Ayanami, comparing her to the Virgin Mary. Yano also has associated her figure with the fragile and chaste women portrayed in fin de si√®cle art, particularly popular among the works of Symbolists painters. The architect Kaichiro Morikawa compared the face of the first Rei, usually presented in a distorted and deformed way, to the installations of Tony Oursler, also comparing her bedroom to some photographs by Gottfried Helnwein. Cultural impact Popularity and critical reception From 1995, Rei became the subject of many homages from the Neon Genesis Evangelion fandom, including fan fiction, fan art and d≈çjinshi, proving popular. She also ranked highly in Japanese surveys about the most popular anime characters. Immediately after Evangelion's first airing concluded, the 1996 and 1997 Anime Grand Prix survey by Animage magazine elected Rei \\"best female character of the moment\\". In 1998, when Revival of Evangelion was released, she ranked fifth as the most popular Evangelion female character. Rei also appeared in the monthly surveys of the magazine, remeaning in the top ten in 1997 and 1998 and in the top twenty in the 1999 polls. In 2002, TV Asahi ranked her 36th among the 100 most loved characters in anime history. TV Asahi later published the results of polls on anime's greatest scenes; all of them were related to the character. Rei Ayanami also won first place in Newtype magazine popularity charts. In August and September 2009 she ranked in fourth and second place. In October, she took third place, becoming the most popular Evangelion female character. Rei was voted the most popular female anime character from the 1990s in a Newtype poll in March 2010. In 2013, the NHK Shibuya Anime Land radio show ranked her among the ten most popular anime heroines of all time. She also ranked in Evangelion popularity polls, usually in the top three. Japanese critic Hiroki Azuma described Rei Ayanami as \\"an extremely impressive character\\", praising the performance of Megumi Hayashibara and its psychological realism, since \\"Rei's solitude is grounded in a completely tactile substantiality which gives us extremely realistic images of the discommunication that children of the present face\\". The Anime-planet.com site, while appreciating some interesting revelations about her past and still considering her \\"by far the most interesting character\\", was crtical that her character had not been \\"explored as much as she should have been\\". Animecritics.com wrote, \\"[Rei] has absolutely no personality to speak of, and she remains an enigma for most of the series. Part of the intrigue in the series is discovering the secrets she holds.\\" Raphael See criticized the characterization of the whole Evangelion cast for being \\"cliche\\", saying he did not understand the reasons for her great popularity. For Oricon News, Rei's character has become Evangelions emblem. Newtype praised the fifth and the sixth episode, describing the scene in which she smiles at Gendo (episode 5) as \\"excellent\\", and the scene where she greets Shinji before the battle against the Angel Ramiel (episode 6) as \\"an impressive moment\\". In February 1996, Animedia magazine ranked her smile scene from the sixth episode among the most memorable anime moments of the month. Justin Wu (The Artifice) also praised the scene, describing it as a \\"powerful\\" and \\"iconic moment\\", since it is \\"the first time she has deliberately shown an emotion, and one of the handful of times she has done so throughout the whole series\\". A column a September 2007 issue of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper said, on the occasion of Evangelion 1.0 theatrical release, that there were over one million dedicated Rei fans in Japan and that, \\"This bandaged Goddess is an icon of Japanese anime.\\" IGN ranked Rei 10th on its list of Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time. Writer Chris Mackenzie noted Rei was one of the most influential characters in the anime series, adding she was different from similar characters since, \\"She's a mystery we never really solve, when you think about it.\\" She had the same place in Mania Entertainment's 10 Iconic Anime Heroines written by Thomas Zoth who commented on the large amount of merchandise based on her and that she started \\"the moe boom in anime\\". While reviewing the films Rebuild of Evangelion, writers from Anime News Network commented on Rei. In the first title, Carlo Santos criticized Rei's personality for being the same as in the TV series, while Justin Sevakis praised her response to Shinji's kindness. Merchandise Wrapped Aonami Line train with Rei in Nagoya Soon after Evangelions first run, Rei became so popular that she generated an explosion of merchandise, selling more than any other series' character. Her image was used in a wide range of products, including toys, t-shirts, action figures, musical instruments, life-size statues, accessories and reproductions of her clothing. In 2001, Broccoli released a simulation game entitled Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ayanami Raising Project, in which the player takes on the task of looking after Rei. On March 30 of the same year, King Records launched an album to celebrate her birth date entitled Evangelion: The Birthday of Rei Ayanami. In 2012, a team built an tall figure of the character outside of the NTV Tower in the Shiodome area of Tokyo as part of the Shiohaku Expo 2012 summer amusement event. The following year, a meticulous reproduction of the girl's bedroom was built, and a life-size model exhibited at the Eva Expo in Shanghai. In 2020, Honda used Rei and other characters from the series for a number of commercials, which aired on the occasion of a collaboration between Evangelion and Honda Civic. Rei Ayanami's action figures in particular enjoyed immediate and unconditional success. In 2005, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first airing of Evangelion, mangaka Mine Yoshizaki designed several action figures of the Angels with anthropomorphic appearances; among the various models, he devised a figure of the Angel Lilith inspired by Rei's character design. According to Japanese writer Kazuhisa Fujie, despite models and toys in the series being a commercial failure at first, Rei's action figures immediately became so popular that they exceeded Evangelion's unit sales, thus creating the first and perhaps only case of a robotic anime \\"where reproductions of the human characters outsold those of the robots\\". Also books and magazines portraying her on the cover were a great success, including an issue of Rolling Stone Japanese edition, among others. A book about her named was published in 1997. Sales of Rei-themed merchandise led Japanese media to call her \\"the girl who manipulates magazines sales at will\\", \\"the fates route to the sold-out sign\\" and \\"the premium girl\\". Legacy Rei Ayanami had a significant influence on Japanese animation and many subsequent fictional characters, with numerous heroines created after the great success of Evangelion sharing her traits. Many critics regarded Rei and her success as the beginning of the so-called moe phenomenon, with the creation of characters according to definite stereotyped features easily recognizable and consumable by the Japanese otaku audience. In the late 1990s, characters bearing a close resemblance to Rei have been produced and consumed on a massive scale in comics, anime and novelization, both in the commercial market and the fanzine market. According to Japanese scholar Hiroki Azuma, this output is not linked to a direct Evangelion influence, since \\"the emergence of Ayanami Rei did not influence many authors so much as change the rules of the moe-elements sustaining otaku culture\\". As a result, even authors who were not deliberately thinking of Evangelion unconsciously began to produce characters closely resembling Rei, using newly registered moe-elements, such as a quiet personality, blue hair, white skin, mysterious power and an apparent absence of emotions. Azuma regards Ruriko Tsukishima from Shizuku as being directly influenced by Rei, while Ruri Hoshino of Martian Successor Nadesico was created as a combination of both. She also influenced manga author Nobuhiro Watsuki on Yukishiro Tomoe's design.Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \\"The Secret Life of Characters (41) Yukishiro (Himura) Tomoe,\\" Rurouni Kenshin Volume 21. Viz Media. 46. Justin Wu (The Artifice) regards Rei as the prototypical , a term used by anime fans to describe reticent and apparently emotionless characters, usually with a monotone voice who speak to-the-point, and avoid unnecessary conversations. This moe element, which gained wide popularity only after Rei's success, can be found in numerous subsequent female characters, including Eva in Black Cat, Ai Enma in Hell Girl and Yuki Nagato in Haruhi Suzumiya. Critics compared other characters to her, including Miharu in Gasaraki, Vanilla H in Galaxy Angel, Neya in Infinite Ryvius, Aruto Kirihara in Kagihime Monogatari Eiky≈´ Alice Rondo, Riza Hawkeye in Fullmetal Alchemist, Dorothy R. Wayneright in The Big O, Anthy Himemiya in Revolutionary Girl Utena, Yuzuriha Inori in Guilty Crown, Miyu in My-HiME and Ai in Zaion: I Wish You Were Here. Serial Experiments Lains Lain Iwakura is also often associated with the character; Lains main screenwriter Chiaki J. Konaka denied a direct influence from Evangelion and, while appreciating their characteristics, he said he did not see many similarities between the two characters. in and According to Kaichiro Morikawa, a Japanese architect and academic, there were a few main characters with physical defects before Evangelion and Rei Ayanami, such as Char Aznable in Mobile Suit Gundam, who has a scar on her forehead, and Princess Kushana in Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind. Justin Wu also noted that, after the success of the series, the bandages gained great popularity, becoming the trademark of the character and that of many cosplayers. According to De'Angelo Epps (CBR), the character contributed to popularizing the kuudere stereotype, a term for male or female characters who hide their true feelings behind a melancholy and cold facade. Rei Ayanami has had an influence on Japanese music. The Japanese band Rey derived its name from her. Singer and guitarist Motoo Fujiwara wrote the lyrics of the song Arue taking inspiration from Rei, with the English title R.A. inspired by the initials letter of her name. Several famous artists have produced fan art about her, including Okama, Huke, Hiroya Oku and Arina Tanemura. Many celebrities have paid tribute to Rei cosplaying her, including Shoko Nakagawa, Natsuki Kat≈ç, Miu Nakamura, Yuuri Morishita, Umika Kawashima, Rio Uchida, Kokoro Shinozaki and Sh≈çma Uno. During Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012 English model Jourdan Dunn wore a dress very similar to the character's plugsuit; however, Gainax only learned about the outfit from the Internet and was perplexed by the situation. Her plugsuit also inspired a piece of clothing for the spring 2016 line by the well-known fashion house Louis Vuitton.

Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume. The Trilogy is a postmodern interpretation of detective and mystery fiction, exploring various philosophical themes.  Plot introduction  A 2006 reissue by Penguin Books is fronted by new pulp magazine-style covers by comic book illustrator Art Spiegelman.  City of Glass  The first story, City of Glass, features an author of detective fiction who becomes a private investigator and descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in the investigation of a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \\"author\\" who reports the events as reality, to \\"Paul Auster the writer\\", a character in the story, to \\"Paul Auster the detective\\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, the protagonist. \\"City of Glass\\" has an intertextual relationship with Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \\"Paul Auster the writer,\\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \\"imaginative reading,\\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.  Ghosts  The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.  The Locked Room  The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction.

The title is a reference to a \\"locked room mystery\\", a popular form of early detective fiction.  Adaptations  City of Glass was adapted in 1994 into a critically acclaimed experimental graphic novel by Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli. It was published as City of Glass: A Graphic Mystery in 2004.

The Minahasa people sometimes refer to themselves as Manado people. Despite the fact that the Minahasan pre-Christian creation myth entails some form of ethnic unification,Lundstr√∂m-Burghoorn, W. 1981. Minahasa civilization: A tradition of change. G√∂teburg, Sweden: ACTA Universitatis Gothoburgensis before the nineteenth century the Minahasa region was in no way unified. Instead, a number of politically independent groups (walak) existed together, often in a permanent state of war.Schouten, M. J. C. 1983. Leadership and social mobility in a Southeast Asian society: Minahasa, 1677 - 1983. Leiden: KITLV Press Minahasans are the most populous ethnic group in the Minahasan peninsula of North Sulawesi. They are a Christian-majority region in a country (Indonesia) with a Muslim majority. The indigenous inhabitants of Minahasa are Austronesian people who are the descendants of earlier migrations from further North. Prior to contact with Europeans, people living in the Minahasan peninsula primarily had contact with inhabitants from North Maluku and with Chinese and Malay traders from within the Indonesian archipelago. From the 1500s onwards, the region had contact with the Portuguese and Spanish. Ultimately, however, it was the Dutch who colonized the region; firstly through the actions of the Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie 'Dutch East Indies Company' (VOC) and, from 1817 onwards, through the administration of the Dutch nation state.Schouten, M. J. C. 1983. Leadership and social mobility in a Southeast Asian society: Minahasa, 1677 - 1983. Leiden: KITLV Press There are nine languages which are indigenous to the Minahasan peninsula. All languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, and five of these (Tondano, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tontemboan, and Tonsawang) comprise the Minahasan microgroup, while three (Bantik, Toratan, and Sangir) are part of the Sangiric group.Blust, R. 2013. The Austronesian languages. Canberra: Asia Pacific Linguistics Open Access Monographs < http://pacling.anu.edu.au/materials/Blust2013Austronesian.pdf> Another language (Ponosakan) is considered moribund and is part of the Gorontalo- Mongondow microgroup. The language of wider communication is Manado Malay (also known as Minahasa Malay), a Malay-based creole which contains numerous loan words from Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch - a result of contact with European powers from 1523 onwards. While Manado Malay bears some similarity with other varieties of Malay spoken in eastern Indonesia, it also displays a number of differences.Stoel, R. 2005. Focus in Manado Malay: grammar, particles, and intonation. Leiden:CNWS publications Minahasa Raya is the area covering Bitung City, Manado City, Tomohon City, Minahasa Regency, North Minahasa Regency, South Minahasa Regency and Southeast Minahasa Regency, which are altogether seven of the fifteen regional administrations in the province of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. In the Dutch East Indies the Minahasa people identified strongly with the Dutch language, culture and the Protestant faith ‚Äî so strongly, in fact, that when Indonesia became independent in 1945 certain factions of political elites of the region even pleaded with the Dutch to let it become a province of the Netherlands. Document The centuries-old strong bond between the Minahasa and the Netherlands has recently been studied and explained using the Stranger King concept. There is a considerable number of people from the Minahasa living in the Netherlands, as part of the Indo (Eurasian) community.Minahassers in Indonesi√´ en Nederland: migratie en cultuurverandering, Menno Hekker, Disertasi Universiteit van Amsterdam, 1993  History  alt= The word 'Minahasa' is made up of the prefix ma-, the infix -in-, and the independent word esa 'one'.Dotulong, B. 2010.

Weltevreden:Landsdrukkerij North Sulawesi never developed any large empire. In 670, the leaders of the different tribes, who all spoke different languages, met by a stone known as Watu Pinawetengan. There they founded a community of independent states, who would form one unit and stay together and would fight any outside enemies if they were attacked.Roderick C. Wahr, History Timeline Minahasa Website Until well into the 19th century the Minahasa was made up of rivaling warrior societies that practiced headhunting. Only during 'Pax Neerlandica' of the formal colonisation of the Dutch East Indies did the state of permanent internal warfare and the practice of headhunting subside.Schouten, M.J.C. Leadership and Social Mobility in a Southeast Asian society. Minahasa, 1677-1983. (Publisher: KITLV Press, Leiden, 1998) P.11 and P.51  Origin of Minahasa people  Minahasan man in Kabasaran attire in Tomohon The province of North Sulawesi was the location of one of the first southward Austronesian migrations patterns in the late third and second millennia BC.Schouten, M.J.C (1983) 'Leadership and social mobility in a Southeast Asian society', pp. 12-13, Leiden, KITLV Press The generally-accepted hypothesis is that the Austronesian people originally inhabited Taiwan, before migrating and colonising areas in the northern Philippines, the southern Philippines, Borneo, and Sulawesi before splitting into separate groups, with one heading west to Java, Sumatra, and Malaya, while the other moved east towards Oceania.Bellwood, P (1995) 'Austronesian Prehistory in Southeast Asia: Homeland, Expansion, and Transformation', in Bellwood, P, Fox, J, & Tryon, D (eds), The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspectives, pp.103-114, Canberra, Australian National University Press According to Minahasa mythology the Minahasans are descendants of Toar and Lumimuut. Initially, the descendants of Toar-Lumimuut were divided into 3 groups: Makatelu-pitu (three times seven), Makarua-siouw (two times nine) and Pasiowan-Telu (nine times three). They multiplied quickly. But soon there were disputes among these people. Their leaders named Tona'as then decided to meet and talk about this. They met in Awuan (north of the current Tonderukan hill). That meeting was called Pinawetengan u-nuwu (dividing of language) or Pinawetengan um-posan (dividing of ritual). At that meeting the descendants were divided into three groups named Tonsea, Tombulu, and Tontemboan corresponding to the groups mentioned above. At the place where this meeting took place a memorial stone called Watu Pinabetengan (Stone of Dividing) was then built. It is a favourite tourist destination. The groups Tonsea, Tombulu, and Tontemboan then established their main territories which were Maiesu, Niaranan, and Tumaratas respectively. Soon several villages were established outside these territories. These new villages then became a ruling center of a group of villages called puak, later walak, comparable to the present-day district. Subsequently, a new group of people arrived in Pulisan peninsula. Due to numerous conflicts in this area, they then moved inland and established villages surrounding a large lake. These people were therefore called Tondano, Toudano or Toulour (meaning water people). This lake is now the Tondano lake. Minahasa warriors In the following years, more groups came to Minahasa. There were: * people from the islands of Maju and Tidore who landed in Atep. These people were the ancestors of the Tonsawang ethnic group. * people from Tomori Bay. These were the ancestors of the subethnic Pasam-bangko (Ratahan dan Pasan) * people from Bolaang Mangondow who were the ancestors of Ponosakan (Belang). * people from the Bacan archipelago and Sangi, who then occupied Lembeh, Talisei Island, Manado Tua, Bunaken and Mantehage. These were the subethnic Bobentehu (Bajo). They landed in the place now called Sindulang. They then established a kingdom called Manado which ended in 1670 and became walak Manado. * people from Toli-toli, who in the early 18th century landed first in Panimburan and then went to Bolaang-Mangondow * and finally to the place where Malalayang is now located. These people were the ancestors of the subethnic Bantik. There are the nine groups in North Sulawesi which are originally differentiated ethnically and linguistically. Of these nine, only the first five are of Minahasan descent: *Tonsea *Tombulu *Tontemboan *Tondano (Toulour) *Tonsawang *Ratahan (Torat√°n) *Ponosakan *Sangir *Bantik The first recorded use of the term 'Minahasa' occurs in a treaty with the Dutch signed in 1790. A common misconception is that the unity among different ethnic groups arose as a result of a historical alliance to fight the Bolaang- Mongondow kingdom. However, the creation of Minahasan unity was in fact almost exclusively the product of the colonisation and Christian conversion enacted by the Dutch. The colonial administration and Dutch missionaries undertook various policies which resulted in ethnic unifcation and the increased use of the Manado Malay language. Among the Minahasan heroes in the wars against Bolaang-Mongondow are: Porong, Wenas, Dumanaw and Lengkong (in the war near Lilang village), Gerungan, Korengkeng, Walalangi (near Panasen, Tondano), Wungkar, Sayow, Lumi, and Worotikan (in the war along Amurang Bay). Until the dominance of Dutch influence in the 17th and 18th century, the Minahassans lived in warrior societies that practised headhunting.Schouten, M.J.C Leadership and social mobility in a Southeast Asian society (Publisher: KITLV Press, Leiden, 1998)  European era  alt= In the second half of the 16th century, both Portuguese and the Spanish arrived in North Sulawesi. Half-way through the 17th century, there was a rapprochement between the Minahasan chiefs and the Dutch VOC (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie), which was given concrete form in the treaty of 1679 (which can be found in the Corpus Diplomaticus Neerlando-Indicum 1934, vol. III, no 425). From 1801-1816, the Netherlands were occupied by the French imperial forces of Napoleon and the Minahasa came under English control. In 1817 Dutch rule was re-established until 1949. At the time of the first contact with Europeans the sultanate of Ternate held some sway over North Sulawesi, and the area was often visited by seafaring Bugis traders from South Sulawesi. The Spanish and the Portuguese, the first Europeans to arrive, landed in Minahasa via the port of Makasar, but also landed at Sulu Island (off the north coast of Borneo) and at the port of Manado. The abundance of natural resources in Minahasa made Manado a strategic port for European traders sailing to and from the spice island of Maluku. Although they had sporadic contacts with Minahasa, the Spanish and Portuguese influence was limited by the power of the Ternate sultanate. The Portuguese and Spaniards left reminders of their presence in the north in subtle ways. Portuguese surnames and various Portuguese words not found elsewhere in Indonesia, like garrida for an enticing woman and buraco for a bad man, can still be found in Minahasa. In the 1560s the Portuguese Franciscan missionaries made some converts in Minahasa. The Spanish had already set themselves up in the Philippines and Minahasa was used to plant coffee that came from South America because of its rich soil. Manado was further developed by Spain to become the center of commerce for the Chinese traders who traded the coffee in China. With the help of native allies the Spanish took over the Portuguese fortress in Amurang in the 1550s, and Spanish settlers also established a fort at Manado, so that eventually Spain controlled all of the Minahasa. It was in Manado where one of the first Indo-Eurasian (Mestizo) communities in the archipelago developed during the 16th century.Wahr, C.R. Minahasa (history) Website The first King of Manado (1630) named Muntu Untu was in fact the son of a Spanish Mestizo.Wahr, C. R. Minahasa (history) Website Spain renounced her possessions in Minahasa by means of a treaty with the Portuguese in return for a payment of 350,000 ducats. Minahasan rulers sent Supit, Pa'at and Lontoh (their statues are located in Kauditan, about 30 km to Bitung) where they made an alliance treaty with the Dutch. Together eventually gained the upper hand in 1655, built their own fortress in 1658 and expelled the last of the Portuguese a few years later. By the early 17th century the Dutch had toppled the Ternate sultanate, and then set about eclipsing the Spanish and Portuguese. As was the usual case in the 1640s and 50s, the Dutch colluded with local powers to throw out their European competitors. In 1677 the Dutch occupied Pulau Sangir and, two years later, the Dutch governor of Maluku, Robert Padtbrugge, visited Manado. Out of this visit came a treaty with the local Minahasan chiefs, which led to domination by the Dutch for the next 300 years although indirect government only commenced in 1870. The Dutch helped unite the linguistically diverse Minahasa confederacy, and in 1693 the Minahasa scored a decisive military victory against the Bolaang to the south. The Dutch influence flourished as the Minahasans embraced European culture and Christian religion. Missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were among the first attempts at mass education in Indonesia, giving their graduates a considerable edge in gaining civil service, military and other positions of influence. Relations with the Dutch were often less than cordial (a war was fought around Tondano between 1807 and 1809) and the region did not actually come under direct Dutch rule until 1870. The Dutch and the Minahasans eventually became so close that the north was often referred to as the 12th province of the Netherlands. A Manado - based political movement called Twaalfde Provincie even campaigned for Minahasa's integration into the Dutch state in 1947. Portuguese activity apart, Christianity became a force in the early 1820s when a Calvinist group, the Netherlands Missionary Society, turned from an almost exclusive interest in Maluku to the Minahasa area. The wholesale conversion of the Minahasans was almost complete by 1860. With the missionaries came mission schools, which meant that, as in Ambon and Roti, Western education in Minahasa started much earlier than in other parts of Indonesia. The Dutch government eventually took over some of these schools and also set up others. Because the schools taught in Dutch, the Minahasans had an early advantage in the competition for government jobs and places in the colonial army. Minahasans remain among the educated elite today. =Armed forces= alt= A relatively large number of Minahasans pursued professional military careers in the colonial army (KNIL). Next to the South Moluccan Ambonese, the Minahasa Menadonese were also considered a martial race and therefore particularly competent and trustworthy as soldiers. As KNIL soldiers the Minahasans fought alongside the Dutch to subdue rebellions in other parts of the archipelago, such as for instance the Java War of 1825-30. As a large percentage of Minahasans was formally equalised to the European legal class, young men were also obliged to serve as conscripts when mandatory military service for Europeans was introduced in 1917. Older men (as off 32) were obliged to join the Home guard (Dutch: Landstorm). During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in WWII many Menadonese soldiers were held captive as POW's. They seemed to gain a special role in the Dutch scheme of things and their loyalty to the Dutch as soldiers, their Christian religion and their geographic isolation from the rest of Indonesia all led to a sense of being 'different' from the other ethnic groups of the archipelago.  Republic of Indonesia  The Japanese occupation of 1942‚Äì45 was a period of deprivation, and the Allies bombed Manado heavily in 1945. During the Revolution for independence that followed, there was bitter division between pro-Indonesian Unitarians and those favoring Dutch-sponsored federalism. The appointment of a Manadonese Christian, Sam Ratulangi, as the first republican governor of eastern Indonesia, was decisive in winning Minahasan support for the republic. A contra-revolution such as the Republik Maluku Selatan one in the Moluccas was averted. As the young republic lurched from crisis to crisis, Jakarta's monopoly over the copra trade seriously weakened Minahasa's economy. As in Sumatra, there was a general feeling that the central government was inefficient, development was stagnating and money was being plugged into Java. Circumstances favored the spread of communism. Illegal exports flourished and in June 1956 Jakarta ordered the closure of Manado port, the busiest smuggling port in the republic. Local leaders refused and Jakarta backed down. Soon Permesta rebels confronted the central government with demands for political, economic and regional reform. Jakarta responded by bombing Menado city in February 1958, and then invading the Minahasa in June 1958, but were only able to end the Permesta revolt in 1961. =Permesta= Minahasa Separatist Movement Flag circa 2012 In March 1957, the military leaders of both southern and northern Sulawesi launched a confrontation with the central government, with demands for greater regional autonomy. They demanded more local development, a fairer share of revenue, help in suppressing the Kahar Muzakar rebellion in Southern Sulawesi, and a cabinet of the central government led jointly by Sukarno and Hatta. At least initially the 'Permesta' (Piagam Perjuangan Semesta Alam) rebellion was a reformist rather than a separatist movement. Negotiations between the central government and the Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in southern Sulawesi, but the Minahasan leaders were dissatisfied with the agreements and the movement split. Inspired, perhaps, by fears of domination by the south, the Minahasan leaders declared their own autonomous state of North Sulawesi in June 1957. By this time the central government had the situation in southern Sulawesi pretty much under control but in the north they had no strong local figure to rely upon and there were rumors that the United States, suspected of supplying arms to rebels in Sumatra, was also in contact with the Minahasan leaders. The possibility of foreign intervention finally drove the central government to seek military support from southern Sulawesi. Permesta forces were driven out of central Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Sangir island and from Morotai in Maluku (from whose airfield the rebels had hoped to fly bombing raids on Jakarta). The rebels' few planes (supplied by the USA and flown by Filipino, Taiwanese and US pilots) were destroyed. US policy shifted, favoring Jakarta, and in June 1958 central government troops landed in Minahasa. The Permesta rebellion was finally put down in mid-1961. The effect of both the Sumatran and Sulawesi rebellions was to strengthen exactly those trends the rebels had hoped to weaken. Central authority was enhanced at the expense of local autonomy, radical nationalism gained over pragmatic moderation, the power of the communists and Sukarno increased while that of Hatta waned, and Sukarno was able to establish guided democracy in 1959. Five years after, Sukarno did sign Law no.13 creating the new province of North Sulawesi as enacted by the People's Representative Council, ending a long dream of a province of their own for the Minahasa. Recently, the Indonesian government has adopted policies to strengthen local autonomy, the very idea that Permesta fought for.Government of Minahasa Regency F.S. Watuseke: Sedjarah Minahasa.

Arsip Nasional RI No. 134, 162, 169. Minahasa website (English and Indonesian language)  Culture  Ancient Minahasa society was both competitive and egalitarian. Important Walian (shaman) (religious shaman) were often female and Minahasa culture does not show any particular discrimination against women. Important decisions concerning the community were made in a democratic manner. Due to the virtual equality in birth a persons rise in status was mainly dependent on personal achievements and the expression of personal virtues. Leadership positions and higher status were acquired via two main mechanisms: the deployment of wealth and the show of bravery. The first was achieved via 'Status selematans', ceremonial feasts called Foso (feast) and the latter originally via successful headhunting.Schouten, M.J.C Leadership and social mobility in a Southeast Asian society (Publisher: KITLV Press, Leiden, 1998) P.22 Headhunting helped the warrior gain a religious concept called 'Keter', which is similar to the Malay term 'Semangat' and means Soul/spirit substance. This spiritual and physical force is expressed as courage, eloquence, virility and fertility. Even without the actual practice of headhunting and other old traditions and customs these core elements of original Minahasa culture are still held in high regard. To this day the deployment of wealth, bravery, obstinacy and the eloquence of verbal resistance are important to social mobility in the Minahasa.Schouten, M.J.C Leadership and social mobility in a Southeast Asian society (Publisher: KITLV Press, Leiden, 1998) p.24 Minhasa dead were buried in waruga, a type of sarcophagus, until the practice was outlawed by the Dutch. Although after the Dutch came to Minahasa and after the treaty of 1699 between the Dutch and the Minahasan people, most Minahasan people especially the upperclass and the ones living in Manado slowly adopted European and Dutch culture and heavily westernized. In the 18th and 19th century the Minahasan people has completely adopted the more European culture, cloathing and lifestyle until the revival of ancient Minahasan culture in the late 20th century. Although even until today there are some Minahasan who are more Dutch or European cultured. Making Minahasan people a very unique group of people among other Indonesian. And it was described that Minahasa itself is a lonely outpost of Western culture and Christianity, a bastion of loyalty to colonial power. Where Minahasan are actually the subject of a study called Stranger King theory.  Religion  Tontemboan Bible, by M. Adriani-Gunning and J. Regar, published in 1907 by Firma P.W.M Trap, Leiden, Holland. In 1907, Firma P.W.M Trap, Leiden, Holland published a Bible in the Tontemboan language, a language of Minahasa. It was edited by M. Adriani-Gunning and J. Regar. At 93% of the population, the Minahasa Regency has one of highest proportions of Christianity in Indonesia. It has the highest density of church buildings in Indonesia, with approximately one church for every 100m road.Sensus Penduduk 2010 This is due to a successful missionary campaign by European Christians in Northern Sulawesi.  Cuisine  Minahasan cuisine is very spicy, and can feature ingredients not typically found in other parts of Indonesia. For example, dog (RW, short for rintek wuuk, or \\"fine hair\\" in Tontemboan), cat (tusa', also known as eveready because of the cat logo used by the battery), forest rat, and fruit bat (paniki), python snake or the local called it patola are commonly eaten. Other than these exotic meats, seafoods are abundant in Manado and other port cities in North Sulawesi. Popular fish such as cakalang (skipjack tuna), tuna, red snapper, and tude (mackerel). Cakalang fufu, the smoked skipjack tuna is a popular dish of Bitung fishing town. The provincial capital Manado is often referred to as Kota Tinutuan, in reference to a popular local dish: a rice porridge made with corn, smoked fish, greens, and chilies. Known outside the province as Bubur Manado, tinutuan is supposed to improve health and vitality. Another popular minahasan cuisine is rica-rica and dabu-dabu. Rica-rica is dishes usually fish or meat, cooked in spicy red chili, shallots, garlic, and tomato, while dabu-dabu is a type of condiment similar to sambal, made of chopped chilli, shallots, and green tomato mixed with a little vinegar or lime juice. Another vegetables is sayur bunga papaya, papaya flower buds sauteed with shallots, chilli and green tomato.  Dance  A Kabasaran war dance, performed at a parade, 2006 Kabasaran is the fierce and famous Minahasan wardance which reminds of the old Minahasa warrior societies. The dancers wear red garments which in the old times was a color exclusive for the accomplished headhunter. This dance is similar to the Moluccan Cakalele wardance.The Minahasa - Sociale Struktuur - De Kabasaran Dans Another famous dance is the katrili dance that‚Äôs still widely performed in minahasa. The katrili dance is originally a Portuguese folk dance and was adopted into minahasan society. The dancer would use a European style ball dress for the ladies and usually a formal European attire for the men, usually consisting of a plain shirt a vest dress or dancing shoes and a wide brimmed hat (a fedora or a slouch hat).  Music  Native Minahasan music includes percussions such as gong, drum and kolintang. Minahasa music is highly influenced by that of the European colonials; their festivals feature large marching bands made up of clarinets, saxophones (source), trumpets, trombones, and tubas, all constructed out of local bamboo, which form the basis of a song genre known as musik bambu.http://www.minahasaraya.net/frame1.htm?http&&&www.minahasaraya.net;/bamboo.htm Minahasa website  Languages  In Minahasa, 5 distinct languages are spoken: Tonsawang, Tontemboan, Toulour, Tonsea and Tombulu. In 1996, the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, published the North Sulawesi Language Survey by Scott Merrifield and Martinus Salea. It gives an overview of the classification and distribution of the languages, based on a detailed study of the phonology and vocabulary.North Sulawesi Language Survey, by Scott Merrifield, Martinus Salea, 1996 Influences of Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch can be found in Manado Malay: Chair in Indonesian is kursi, in Manado Malay it is called kadera (cadeira - Portuguese word for chair). Horse in Indonesian is kuda, a word of Sanskrit origin. In the town of Tomohon, a horse is called kafalio ('cavalo - Portuguese', \\"caballo - Spanish). While there is not much known about the origin of ideogramatical Minahasa writing system, currently the orthography used for indigenous Minahasan languages closely matches that used for Indonesian. Cultural revival alt= Ever since the overall de- centralisation following the end of Suharto's New Order era the Minahasa is bolstering its regional autonomy scheme, among others by positioning itself to profile a unique cultural entity & identity. The three main Minahasa NGO's active in the cultural revival movement are: 'Yayasan Suara Nurami' (The Voice from Within Foundation); 'Minahasa Wangko' (Minahasa the Great) both founded by Bert Supit and 'Peduli Minahasa' (Take care of Minahasa).Jacobson, On the Question of Contemporary Identity in Minahasa, North Sulawesi Province, Indonesia.

Tulpehocken Creek joins the Schuylkill River near Reading in the map. Tulpehocken Creek is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the Schuylkill River in southeastern Pennsylvania in the United States, and during the American Canal Age, once provided nearly half the length of the Union Canal linking the port of Philadelphia, the largest American city and the other communities of Delaware Valley with the Susquehanna basin and the Pennsylvania Canal System connecting the Eastern seaboard to Lake Erie and the new settlements of the Northwest Territory via the Allegheny}, Monongahela. and Ohio Rivers at Pittsburgh. An important transportation route in the early United States, the creek drains a limestone hill country area of Berks County south of the Appalachian Mountains and is considered one of the finest trout streams in southeastern Pennsylvania. The valley of the creek was known in colonial times as the Tulpehocken, stretching west of Reading. It was inhabited by the Lenape and was a destination for early German-speaking settlers. The name comes from a Lenape word Tulpewikaki, meaning \\"land of turtles\\". It is a designated Pennsylvania Scenic River. Major tributaries include the Cacoosing Creek, Spring Creek and Northkill Creek. Description Tulpehocken Creek rises in eastern Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, and flows generally east, in a winding course, through Myerstown, entering Berks County, passing north of Womelsdorf. At Womelsdorf it turns abruptly north, then flows southeast, through the Blue Marsh Lake reservoir and joins the Schuylkill at Reading. In the 1720s, the creek's valley, like many in those days of dependence upon water power with a poor transportation infrastructure system, was a destination for early Swiss and Palatine settlers, who used the creek for extensive milling operations. In the 19th century, as it had for the light canoes of the Susquehannock and Delaware peoples, it provided an important early transportation route with the building in 1828 of the Union Canal along the river, connecting from its headwaters to those of Quittapahilla Creek in Lebanon County. The proposed canal, again surveyed in the 1790s as the private stock corporation Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company and its successor, the Union canal taken together with the Schuylkill Canal (1822) running W-E from Reading to Philadelphia (allowing large shipments of coal to Philadelphia), provided one of only two water routes between the Susquehanna River and the Delaware River. The other was the Chesapeake and Delaware canal. Using the canal, manufacturies in Philadelphia and New Jersey could ship goods west to the newly settled lands west of the gaps of the Allegheny, out to the midwest. The Union canal and the Schuylkill Canal companies were private stock companies and worked with the State built Pennsylvania Canal to tranship grain to Philadelphia. The improvements along Tulpehocken Creek by engineering navigations of the two companies provided nearly half the length of the final Union Canal completed in 1828. The creek is impounded for flood control above Reading by the earthen Blue Marsh Dam (see Blue Marsh State Park) completed in 1979 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to form the Blue Marsh Lake reservoir. The bottom-release design of the dam allows for the discharge of a cold water at a constant temperature, resulting in an ideal habitat for rainbow trout and brown trout, which are stocked annually in the stream.

She was named after the Battle of Cape Matapan between the Royal Navy and the Regia Marina, which ended in a decisive victory for the RN force, resulting in the destruction of three cruisers and two destroyers of the Italian Navy and was a heavy blow to the Italians. So far, she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name. She was placed in reserve on completion of her sea trials and would remain in such a state for a lengthy period of time, ultimately seeing service in the 1970s as a sonar trials ship. In the process she outlived all her fleetmates in Royal Navy service.Critchley, page 115-6 Operational history Completion and reserve Matapan was built by John Brown & Company. She was launched on 30 April 1945 and finally completed on 5 September 1947. The ship undertook her builders and acceptance sea trials over a period of two weeks, during which she steamed for a total of 150 hours, arriving at Chatham on 22 September, where she was de-stored. Matapan was initially laid up in Gillingham Reach on the River Medway from 28 October 1947 and was subsequently towed to Devonport on 20 July 1948, where she was prepared for preservation in long-term reserve. She was to remain moored in the River Tamar for the next 20 years.Boniface, page 175-6 Conversion to Sonar Trials Ship In 1961 Matapan was first earmarked for conversion to a sonar trials ship, to replace . It appears that lack of money to pay for the necessary work, may be the reason why this was delayed for so long.Boniface, page 176 Advances in Soviet nuclear submarine performance during the 1960s rendered the existing NATO sonar equipment, which were based on analogue technology of World War II origin and had limited range, obsolescent. In 1968 the Admiralty issued a draft Staff Requirement for the Type 2016 hull sonar, which was intended to replace not only the widely used Type 184, but other types of specialist sonars, such as the Types 170, 176 and 177. Type 2016 had an effective range of up to in calm conditions in coastal waters, and up to in deep water, compared to for the Type 177. It used pre-formed digital beams at lower frequencies than previous types, that could track many more targets, whilst using fewer ratings to process the information. The drawback of the use of much lower frequencies however, was the need for a much longer array. The urgency of the need led to the plan to convert Matapan being revived, as a test bed for the new equipment.Friedman, page 299-303 On 5 January 1970, Matapan was towed to Portsmouth where she began her conversion, that resulted in her appearance becoming radically different from when she was launched in 1945. To house the x arrays required on either side of the keel, required the addition of a deep skeg on the bottom of her hull, which would increase her draught to and increase her displacement to 3835 tons. Additionally, a large bulbous sonar dome was added to her bow. All of her armament was removed and a new deckhouse and bridge were added forward, along with a plated foremast to house additional radars. Towards the stern, she was fitted with a second funnel to vent the exhaust gases from the generators needed to power the sonar, and a helicopter flight deck on a deckhouse aft. The ship was also re-wired and fitted with new operations and control rooms, and additional accommodation for scientific staff. The reconstruction work was completed in July 1972 and she began her sea trials.Boniface, page 177 Service as Sonar Trials Ship 1973‚Äì1977 Upon completion of her sea trials, Matapan entered active service for the very first time, commissioned on 2 February 1973, joining the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), based in Portland. Her trials were conducted initially in British coastal waters, where the sonar operators found that their new equipment was very loud and required the use of ear defenders.Boniface, page 178 During 1976 she operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean, undertaking trials with the United States Navy, including operating with the submarine, . During these exercises it was reported by P.O.Moore (Petty Officer, Torpedo and Anti-Submarine Instructor) that: \\"The crew of USS Tullibee, claimed that having our sonar ping them was like having a metal bucket on your head and someone hitting it with a sledgehammer.\\"Boniface, page 179 Late in her career, Matapan also undertook testing of an alternative Towed Array Sonar, Type 2031, which offered the improved performance of the Type 2016, without the cost and space needs of the hull mounted type. The Type 2016 however, had already had a major influence on future warship evolution, as the Royal Navy's new Type 22 frigate was designed to mount the Type 2016, which resulted in a step change in hull size, in comparison to previous frigate designs, and ultimately it saw service in the larger warships of the Royal Navy, including the s and Type 42 destroyers. The towed array Type 2031 and its successor, the Type 2087, manufactured by Thales, have now become the standard equipment of the Royal Navy Type 23 frigates.Friedman, page 302 Final days Matapan was decommissioned in August 1977 and laid up at Portsmouth. On 18 May 1979 she was sold to H.K.Vickers and was broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.Boniface, page 179 References Publications  Category:Battle-class destroyers of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1945 ships Category:Cold War destroyers of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Matapan (D43)"},{"id":"655405","text":"Mohamed El-Amine Souef (born July 1962) is a Comorian diplomat and former foreign minister, ambassador to Egypt, and Permanent Representative to the Arab League (1995‚Äì1998).

Dissatisfied workers in several unions began the strike to gain higher wages after two years of World War I wage controls. Most other local unions joined the walk-out, including members of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions. The strike's demand for higher wages came within months of the end of World War I, the original justification for the wage controls. From 1915 to 1918, Seattle had seen a big increase in union membership, and union leaders were inspired by the Russian revolution of 1917. Some commentators blamed the strike on Bolsheviks and other radicals inspired by \\"un-American\\" ideologies, making it the first expression of the anti-left sentiment that characterized the Red Scare of 1919 and 1920. Most union members at the time believed that workers should be in control of industry. Background The 'right In these years, more workers in the city were organized in unions than ever before. There was a 400 percent increase in union membership from 1915 to 1918. At the time, workers in the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, were becoming increasingly radicalized, with many in the rank and file supportive of the recent revolution in Russia and working toward a similar revolution in the United States. In the fall of 1919, for instance, Seattle longshoremen refused to load arms destined for the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Russia and attacked those who attempted to load them.History Committee of the General Strike Committee, accessed June 6, 2011 The arrival of the Shilka in Seattle on December 24, 1917 added to the thought of Bolshevik involvement. The ship had been damaged and thrown off course in a storm and limped its way into the port almost out of fuel, food and fresh water. The U.S. Attorney in Seattle was tipped off by an \\"informant\\" that the ship was coming and it was going to \\"aid the enemy.\\" The enemy at this time would have been the labor parties threatening a strike. Many believed that its arrival signified a Bolshevik connection with the labor unrest in Seattle. A lot of rumors came about because of this ship's arrival. The Seattle Post- Intelligencer ran a front-page article about an I.W.W. ship being held that contained over a hundred thousand dollars to help I.W.W. members get out of jail. This article proved to be false as the search of the vessel by local law enforcement turned up nothing of significance. A first-hand account of a sailor aboard the ship claimed that there was no evidence found on board because the only contentious material was some flyers in a briefcase that were carried off of the ship upon its arrival. Another passenger that arrived with the ship was arrested for taking part in labor talks with one of the unions in the area.Magden, Ronald. ‚ÄúThe Radical Era.‚Äù A History of Seattle Waterfront Workers, 1884-1934. 1st ed. Seattle, Wash.: International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union 19 of Seattle, the Washington Commission for the Humanities, 1991. Although there was never any concrete evidence connecting the Shilka to the labor parties of Seattle, there was enough to show that the labor parties at the least had the support of Bolshevik Russia. There was a lot of fear of the Bolsheviks because it was known that they had been hoping for a revolution in the Western World in order to support Russia by pooling resources. The ship spent about a month in port before it was allowed to leave and was not seen again in the Seattle area. Most unions in Seattle were officially affiliated with the AFL, but the ideas of ordinary workers tended to be more radical than their leaders. A local labor leader from the time discussed the politics of Seattle's workers in June 1919:Brecher, 120 > I believe that 95 percent of us agree that the workers should control the > industries. Nearly all of us agree on that but very strenuously disagree on > the method. Some of us think we can get control through the Cooperative > movement, some of us think through political action, and others think > through industrial action. Another journalist described the spread of propaganda relating to the Russian Revolution: > For some time these pamphlets were seen by hundreds on Seattle's streetcars > and ferries, read by men of the shipyards on their way to work. Seattle's > businessmen commented on the phenomenon sourly; it was plain to everyone > that these workers were conscientiously and energetically studying how to > organize their coming to power. Already, workers in Seattle talked about > \\"workers' power\\" as a practical policy for the not far distant future. Strike Seattle shipyard workers leave the shipyard after going on strike, 1919. A few weeks after the November 1918 armistice ended World War I, unions in Seattle's shipbuilding industry demanded a pay increase for unskilled workers. They formed the Seattle Metal Trades Council, made up of delegates from twenty-one different craft unions; there were seventeen at the time of the first strike vote. At the time of the General Strike, these separate unions no longer made separate agreements with the yard-owners; a single blanket-agreement was made at intervals by the Metal Trades Council for all the crafts comprising it. In August 1917, the workers had succeeded in establishing a uniform wage scale for one third of the metal tradesmen working in the city. At the time of the general strike, James Taylor was president of the Council. In an attempt to divide the ranks of the union, the yard owners responded by offering a pay increase only to skilled workers. The union rejected that offer and Seattle's 35,000 shipyard workers went on strike on January 21, 1919.Foner, 65 Controversy erupted when Charles Piez, head of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC), an enterprise created by the federal government as a wartime measure and the largest employer in the industry, sent a telegram to the yard owners threatening to withdraw their contracts if any increase in wages were granted. The message intended for the Metal Trades Association, the owners, was accidentally delivered to the Metal Trades Council, the union. The shipyard workers responded with anger directed at both their employers and the federal government which, through the EFC, seemed to be siding with corporate interests. The workers immediately appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for a general strike of all workers in Seattle. Members of various unions were polled, with almost unanimous support in favor‚Äìeven among traditionally conservative unions. As many as 110 locals officially supported the call for a general strike to begin on February 6, 1919, at 10:00 am. Among the strikers were war veterans who wore their uniforms as they went on strike. Life during the strike The strike committee set up soup kitchens and distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day. In the photo, a woman serves a plate of food to a striking worker. A cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals were formed during the strike, called the General Strike Committee. It acted as a \\"virtual counter-government for the city.\\"Brecher, 122 The committee organized to provide essential services for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. For instance, garbage that would create a health hazard was collected, laundry workers continued to handle hospital laundry, and firemen remained on duty. Exemptions to the stoppage of labor had to be passed by the Strike Committee, and authorized vehicles bore signs to that effect. In general, work was not halted if doing so would endanger lives. In other cases, workers acted on their own initiative to create new institutions. Milk wagon drivers, after being denied the right by their employers to keep certain dairies open, established a distribution system of 35 neighborhood milk stations. A system of food distribution was also established, which throughout the strike committee distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day. Strikers paid twenty-five cents per meal, and the general public paid thirty-five cents. Beef stew, spaghetti, bread, and coffee were offered on an all-you-can- eat basis. Army veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order. A group called the \\"Labor War Veteran's Guard\\" forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons, and used \\"persuasion only.\\"Zinn, 368‚Äì9 Peacekeeping proved unnecessary. The regular police forces made no arrests in actions related to the strike, and general arrests dropped to less than half their normal number. Major General John F. Morrison, stationed in Seattle, claimed that he had never seen \\"a city so quiet and orderly.\\" The methods of organization adopted by the striking workers bore resemblance to anarcho- syndicalism, perhaps reflecting the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the Pacific Northwest, though only a few striking locals were officially affiliated with the IWW. Radical visions The pamphlet entitled \\"Russia Did It.\\" Revolutionary pamphlets littered the streets of the city. One called \\"Russia Did It\\" proclaimed: \\"The Russians have shown you the way out. What are you going to do about it? You are doomed to wage slavery till you die unless you wake up, realize that you and the boss have nothing in common, that the employing class must be overthrown, and that you, the workers, must take over the control of your jobs, and through them, the control over your lives instead of offering yourself up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week, so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil.Brecher, 126 In an editorial in the Seattle Union Record, a union newspaper, activist Anna Louise Strong tried to describe the general strike's power and potential:Brecher, 124-5 Newspaper across the country reprinted excerpts from Strong's editorial.Hagedorn, 87 End of the general strike left Three simultaneous movements brought the strike to an end: Mayor Ole Hanson increased the police and military forces available to enforce order, though there was no disorder, and possibly to take the place of striking workers. Union officials, especially those more senior and those at higher levels of the labor movement, feared that using the general strike as a tactic would fail and set back their organizing efforts. Union members, perhaps seeing the strength of the forces arrayed against them, perhaps mindful of their union leaders concerns began to go back to work. The General Strike Committee attributed the end of the strike to pressure from international union officers and the difficulty of continuing to live in the shut-down city.Zinn, 369‚Äì70 Mayor Hanson had federal troops available and stationed 950 sailors and marines across the city by February 7. He added 600 men to the police force and hired 2,400 special deputies, students from the University of Washington for the most part. On February 7, Mayor Hanson threatened to use 1,500 police and 1,500 troops to replace striking workers the next day, but the strikers assumed this was an empty threat and were proved correct.Foner, 73-4 The Mayor continued his rhetorical attack on February 9, saying that the \\"sympathetic strike was called in the exact manner as was the revolution in Petrograd.\\"Foner, 73 Mayor Hanson told reporters that \\"any man who attempts to take over the control of the municipal government functions will be shot.\\" right The international offices of some of the unions and the national leadership of the AFL began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individual unions to end the strike.Foner, 75 Some locals gave in to this pressure and returned to work. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee, pressured by the AFL and international labor organizations, proposed ending the general strike at midnight on February 8, but their recommendation was voted down by the General Strike Committee. On February 8, some streetcar operators returned to work and restored some critical city transportation services. Seattle's main department store reopened as well.Foner, 74 Then teamsters and newsboys returned to work.Foner, 76 On February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the general strike on February 11 and by noon on that day it was over.Foner, 75-6 It stated its reasons: \\"Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees of unions, from the 'leaders' in the labor movement, even from those very leaders who are still called 'Bolsheviki' by the undiscriminating press. And, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed.\\" The city had been effectively paralyzed for five days, but the general strike collapsed as labor reconsidered its effectiveness under pressure from senior labor leaders and their own obvious failure to match the Mayor's propaganda in the war for public opinion. The shipyard strike, in support of which the general strike had been called, persisted. Aftermath Hanson, July 1, 1919 Immediately following the general strike's end, thirty- nine IWW members were arrested as \\"ringleaders of anarchy\\" despite their playing a marginal role in the development of events. Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson took credit for ending the strike and was hailed by some of the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of \\"domestic Bolshevism.\\" He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor.Murray, 65-6; Hagedorn, 180 He agreed that the general strike was a revolutionary event. In his view, the fact that it was peaceful proved its revolutionary nature and intent. He wrote:Zinn, 370‚Äì1 > The so-called sympathetic Seattle strike was an attempted revolution. That > there was no violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and > covertly announced, was for the overthrow of the industrial system; here > first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no > killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, > as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more > dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the > entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government > out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt‚Äìno matter how achieved. Between the strike's announcement and beginning, on February 4, the U.S. Senate voted to expand the work of its Overman Judiciary Subcommittee from investigating German spies to Bolshevik propaganda. The Committee launched a month of hearings on February 11, the day the strike collapsed. Its sensational report detailed Bolshevik atrocities and the threat of domestic agitators bent on revolution and the abolition of private property. The labor radicalism represented by the Seattle General Strike fit neatly into its conception of the threat American institutions faced.Hagedorn 59,147-8; Murray,94-8 Notes See also * Everett Massacre * Cleveland May Day riots of 1919 * Anna Louise Strong * Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone References * Brecher, Jeremy.

He has been a Jain monk, nuclear disarmament advocate and pacifist. Now living in England, Kumar is founder and Director of Programmes of the Schumacher College international centre for ecological studies, and is Editor Emeritus of Resurgence & Ecologist magazine. His most notable accomplishment is the completion, together with a companion, E. P. Menon, of a peace walk of over 8,000 miles in 1973‚Äì4, from New Delhi to Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington, D.C., the capitals of the world's earliest nuclear-armed countries. He insists that reverence for nature should be at the heart of every political and social debate. Defending criticism that his goals are unrealistic, he has said,  Early life  Kumar was born in Sri Dungargarh, Rajasthan, India. At the age of 9, he left his family and became a Jain monk. At 18, after reading a book by Mahatma Gandhi, he ran away from the mendicant order, to become a student of Vinoba Bhave, an eminent disciple of Gandhi and his nonviolence and land reform ideas.\\"Walking the World for Peace,\\" Context Institute. Accessed: 15 September 2012.  Peace walk  Inspired by Bertrand Russell's civil disobedience against the atomic bomb, in 1962 Kumar and his friend E.P. Menon decided to dedicate themselves to undertaking a peace walk from India to the four capitals of the nuclear world: Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington D.C. and decided to carry no money on their trip. They called it a 'Pilgrimage for peace'. Vinoba Bhave gave the young men two 'gifts'. One was to be penniless wherever they walked. The other was to be vegetarian. They first travelled through Pakistan, where they met great kindness from a country with a huge historic conflict and antipathy towards India. Leaving Pakistan via the Khyber Pass, they continued through Afghanistan, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, and the Caucasus Mountains. They visited Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington, D.C. Travelling on foot and carrying no money, Kumar and his companion would stay with anyone who offered them food or shelter. Satish Kumar at The Convention on Modern Liberty, London, 28/2/2009 While on their way to Moscow they met two women outside a tea factory. After explaining what they were doing one of the women gave them four packets of tea, one to be delivered to each of the leaders of the four nuclear powers and to also deliver a message, \\"when you think you need to press the button, stop for a minute and have a fresh cup of tea\\". This further inspired their journey and became in part the reason for it. They eventually delivered 'peace tea' to the leaders of four of the nuclear powers.BBC World Service radio broadcast, BBC Outlook, 2015 October 25, 0830-0900 GMT, United Kingdom. The journey is chronicled in Kumar's book, Path without Destination.  Professional career   Editor  Between 1973 and 2016, Kumar was editor of Resurgence & Ecologist (combining the former Resurgence magazine, which had been described as the artistic and spiritual flagship of the green movement, with The Ecologist). He contributed an essay to The Society for Curious Thought entitled \\"Focus on Food\\". He has also been a contributor to the BBC's \\"Thought for the Day\\" strand on the Today programme, and also appeared on Desert Island Discs. Kumar was interviewed by Richard Dawkins in his 'Slaves to Superstition' episode of the documentary The Enemies of Reason, investigating the prevalence of unscientific beliefs in modern society. He also made a film, Earth Pilgrim, for BBC2's Natural History Series.  We Are One  Kumar was one of the contributors for writing the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009. The book explores the culture of peoples around the world, portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces. It contains a collection of statements from tribal people, photographs, and essays from international authors, campaigners, politicians, philosophers, poets, artists, journalists, anthropologists, environmentalists and photojournalists. The royalties from the sale of this book go to the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International.  Family life  Kumar, a recipient of the Jamnalal Bajaj International Award, settled in England in 1973. He lives a simple life in Hartland, Devon, with his partner June Mitchell, their son Mukti Kumar Mitchell, and their daughter Maya Kumar Mitchell.  Politics  Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.

The Den√© speak Northern Athabaskan languages. Den√© is the common Athabaskan word for \\"people\\" (Sapir 1915, p. 558). The term \\"Den√©\\" has two usages. More commonly, it is used narrowly to refer to the Athabaskan speakers of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut in Canada, especially including the Chipewyan (Denesuline), Tlicho (Dogrib), Yellowknives (T'atsaot'ine), Slavey (Deh Gah Got'ine or Deh Cho), and Sahtu (the Eastern group in Jeff Leer's classification; part of the Northwestern Canada group in Keren Rice's classification). But it is sometimes also used to refer to all Northern Athabaskan speakers, who are spread in a wide range all across Alaska and northern Canada. Note that Den√© never includes the Pacific Coast Athabaskan or Southern Athabaskan speakers in the continental U.S., despite the fact that the term is used to denote the Athabaskan languages as a whole (the Na-Dene language family). The Southern Athabaskan speakers do, however, refer to themselves with similar words: Din√© (Navajo) and Ind√© (Apache). Alexander Mackenzie described aspects of a number of northern Den√© cultures in the late eighteenth century in his journal of his voyage down the Mackenzie River.  Location  Dene are spread through a wide region. They live in the Mackenzie Valley (south of the Inuvialuit), and can be found west of Nunavut. Their homeland reaches to western Yukon, and the northern part of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alaska and the southwestern United States. Dene were the first people to settle in what is now the Northwest Territories. In northern Canada, historically there were ethnic feuds between the Dene and the Inuit. In 1996, Dene and Inuit representatives participated in a healing ceremony to reconcile the centuries- old grievances. Behchoko, Northwest Territories is the largest Dene community in Canada.  Ethnography  The Dene include five main groups: *Chipewyan (Denesuline), living east of Great Slave Lake, and including the Sayisi Dene living at Tadoule Lake, Manitoba *Tlicho (Dogrib), living between Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes *Yellowknives (T'atsaot'ine), living north of Great Slave Lake *Slavey (Deh Gah Got'ine or Deh Cho), the North Slavey (Sahtu, (Saht√∫ot‚Äôine), including the Locheux, Nahanni, and Bear Lake peoples) living along the Mackenzie River (Deh Cho) near Great Bear Lake, the South Slavey southwest of Great Slave Lake and into Alberta and British Columbia. *Sahtu (Saht√∫ot‚Äôine), including the Locheux, Nahanni, and Bear Lake peoples, in the central NWT. Although the above-named groups are what the term \\"Dene\\" usually refers to in modern usage, other groups who consider themselves Dene include: * Tsuu T'ina, aka the Sarcee, currently located near Calgary, Alberta. * The Beaver people (Danezaa or Dunneza) of northeastern British Columbia and neighbouring regions of northwestern Alberta. * The Tahltan, Kaska, and Sekani people of the Northern Interior of British Columbia. Another group in this region, the Tsetsaut people, lived in the Portland Canal area of the northernmost BC Coast near the border with Alaska. They are now extinct. * The Dakelh (Carrier) peoples of the Northern and Central Interior of British Columbia, and their subgroup the Wet'suwet'en * The Tsilhqot'in people of the eponymous Chilcotin District of the Central Interior of British Columbia * The extinct Nicola Athapaskans, aka the Stuwix (\\"strangers\\" in the Shuswap language), migrated south from northern BC into the Nicola Valley region in the late 18th century and were absorbed into the Nicola people, an alliance of Nlaka'pamux and Okanagan peoples. * The Gwich'in and Tanana and other peoples of Yukon and Alaska are also considered to be Dene, which is to say part of the family of Athapaskan-speaking peoples. In 2005, elders from the Dene People decided to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation (UNPO) seeking recognition for their ancestral cultural and land rights. The largest population of Denesuline speakers live in the northern Saskatchewan village of La Loche and the adjoining Clearwater River Dene Nation. In 2011 the combined population was 3389 people. The Denesuline language is spoken by 89% of the residents.  Notable Dene  * Thanadelthur (c. 1697 ‚Äì 5 February 1717) a woman of the Chipewyan Nation, a guide and interpreter, who was instrumental in forging a peace agreement between the Chipewyan and the Cree people * Ethel Blondin-Andrew, former MP for Western Arctic (Northwest Territories) * Leela Gilday, Canadian folk singer, Juno winner * Jimmy Herman (1940-2013) actor, Dances with Wolves * Matonabbee (c. 1737‚Äì1782), guide for Samuel Hearne's expedition to the Coppermine River * Tahmoh Penikett, actor, Battlestar Galactica and Dollhouse * Eric Schweig, actor, The Last of the Mohicans * Jim Boucher, politician, businessman  See also  *Athabaskan languages *Alaskan Athabaskans (Alaskan Dene, Tinneh), Athabaskan peoples of the interior of Alaska *Navajo Nation (Din√©), southern Athabaskan people *Apache people (Inde), southern Athabaskan people *Hupa, California Athabaskan people *Cahto people, California Athabaskan people *Mattole people, California Athabaskan people *Wailaki, California Athabaskan people *Galice language- speakers (Oregon Athabaskan): Chetco, Tolowa, Coquille, Tututni  References   Further reading  * Abel, Kerry M.

Not officially a dam, but a retarding basin wall. Rear of the North Rocks Dam Wall, about 30m in height. North Rocks is a suburb in the Hills District within Greater Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, located 26 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district. Following the amalgamation of council areas in 2016, the majority of North Rocks falls into the council area of the City of Parramatta. Streets north of the M2 Hills Motorway are within The Hills Shire. History The name North Rocks dates back to the beginning of the settlement at Parramatta and is older even than the name of the city itself, which at first was called Rosehill. In 1789 Governor Phillip reserved large areas to the north and west of Rosehill for the use of Government stock - the present Northmead and Westmead. The reserve to the north was described as extending as far as 'the North Rocks'. The area was also known as Jerusalem Rocks.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 189 North Rocks (Hunts and Darling Mills Creeks) was originally occupied by the Burramattagal clan (burra - eels and fish, matta ‚Äì place of fresh running water) who were part of the Darug nation. North Rocks was once considered as the haunt of convict bolters and bushrangers and regarded as an unsavoury area. With the constant flow of people between Windsor and Parramatta, a gold watch was always a good steal! A noted experience was the hold-up of Dr Sherwin in 1830 by John Macnamara and William Dalton, which resulted in ex-convicts' demise. The North Rocks were a massive sandstone outcrop, which terminated the ridge on the south side of Hunts Creek. These rocks so dominated the landscape and were such prominent features that they gave their name to the locality but were not preserved.Views in Australia ... Scilitoe's Escape, near the North Rocks, 14 Miles from Sydney, NSW - 1824 In 1841 when it was decided to build a new gaol at Parramatta, a contractor bought the Rocks as they consisted of the best sandstone in the district - and were very conveniently situated. His tender was accepted, and much of the North Rocks became gaol walls and flagstones in 1844. Further inroads were made on what was left when the wall of masonry was erected in 1855-56 which held back the waters of Lake Parramatta. Much stone was needed for the dam, as the wall is about long and is fifteen feet thick at the base.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 201 A North Rocks Post Office first opened on 1 February 1894; it was renamed Forrester later that year, Maraylya in 1921 and closed in 1970. The current Post Office opened on 1 November 1921. Prior to North Rocks being rezoned around 1958, it housed around 40 farms, including peach and nectarine orchards, poultry farms and piggeries. When the area was rezoned, one of many new housing estates was named Lynwood Estate. Commercial area North Rocks Shopping Centre (prior to rebranding) North Rocks Shopping Centre and the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children school are located around North Rocks Road. The shopping centre features a Coles Supermarket and Kmart discount department store and more than 70 speciality shops. It was a Westfield Group operation until 2015, when it was sold to Challenger for $127 million. Beside the shopping centre, there is an Aldi supermarket, Anytime Fitness and First Choice Liquor. A small group of shops is also located on the opposite side, around the intersection of North Rocks Road and Lawndale Avenue. North Rocks Markets, a trash and treasure market, is run every Sunday by the local Rotary Club by gold coin donation at the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. The market incorporates a variety of stalls covering new and second-hand items, food, and a computer market and has operated at various locations in the area over 20 years.https://www.sydneyhillsaustralia.com.au/2968/north-rocks-market/ There is a light industrial area towards North Parramatta in the area around Loyalty Road, which includes industrial businesses such as Unilever, Rexona and Officeworks and many other businesses in various industrial estates. Transport At the 2011 census, only 13.0% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 67.3% by car (either as a driver or as a passenger).Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 Census QuickStats North Rocks The M2 Hills Motorway runs through North Rocks, and there is access to the motorway from Pennant Hills Road in Carlingford and Windsor Road in Baulkham Hills. Public transport to, from and throughout the area is provided by bus. Train North Rocks does not have a railway station. However, train services are accessible from nearby Carlingford, Epping and Parramatta railway stations. Bus The Barclay Road M2 Bus Station provides services to the City and Castle Hill as well as services to Macquarie Park, Blacktown and Norwest Business Park. The Barclay Road M2 bus to the city takes 22 minutes. Sydney Buses provides links from Parramatta railway station to Epping railway station through different parts of North Rocks, although both converge at North Rocks Shopping Centre.

North Rocks also boasts an 18-hole competition Golf Course and club facilities on Barclay Road. There are also local softball, soccer, rugby clubs and the Murri-Yanna Track in Bidjigal Reserve which can be accessed from Whitbread Place. North Rocks was also the host to the 1976 Skateboard Winter Olympics.\\"Sydney's Skateboard Winter Olympics\\", ABC News Parks and reserves North Rocks features a number of parks and reserves, such as the Bidjigal Reserve, which includes a towering eucalypt forest, weathered sandstone cliffs, sparkling creeks and sheltered rainforest gullies which surrounds the north and west periphery of the North Rocks border. Fauna includes koala, swamp wallaby, echidna, sugar gliders and eastern water dragon. Platypus were regularly seen up until the installation of the sewer in the mid-1970s, but none since. The diversity of birds is well known in Bidjigal Reserve with 127 species being documented. Rare insectivorous species such as wrens and thornbills have been recorded and the more common species of kookaburras and crimson rosellas seem to be doing well. In recent years, there has also been an increase in numbers of sulphur-crested cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets. The powerful owl, Australia's largest owl also breeds in the reserve and can be heard hooting throughout North Rocks at night. Many of these bird species can be seen throughout North Rocks. Demographics The 2016 census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports the population of North Rocks as 7,965 residents, with 3,863 males and 4,100 females. The demographic breakdowns show that: ; Age distribution: North Rocks residents' median age was 41 years, compared to the national median of 38.

The Saht√∫ peoples live in Colville Lake, Deline, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells and Tulita which form the Sahtu Region of the NWT.Sahtu CommunitiesAbout MACA - Sahtu The Dene of the region are represented by the Sahtu Dene Council who, in 1993, signed the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. Saht√∫ groups include the Hare Dene (K'ahsho Got'ine District, today: Colville Lake and Fort Good Hope), Bear Lake Dene (D√©line District), and Mountain Dene (Tulit'a District). They call themselves also …Åehdzo Got‚Äôƒ±Ã®ne (Trap People). Ethnography An early description of Saht√∫ cultures is given in Alexander Mackenzie's journal of his voyage down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789.Voyages from Montreal Through the Continent of North America to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans in 1789 and 1793 Although there are close interrelationships among the Dene communities, they are culturally and linguistically distinct. The K‚Äôahsho Got‚Äôine (Hare(skin) Dene) are now centred in Fort Good Hope and Colville Lake. The Shita Got‚Äôine (Mountain Dene) have joined with the K‚Äô√°√°l«´ Got‚Äôine (Willow Lake Dene) (they lived around K‚Äô√°√°l√¥ Tu√© - ‚Ä≥Willow Lake‚Ä≥, today known as Brackett Lake) in the community of Tulit‚Äôa. The Saht√∫ot‚Äôine (Saht√∫ Dene or Great Bear Lake Dene) are named after Saht√∫/Great Bear Lake, and are based in Deline. M√©tis people, descendants of relationships established between Dene people and fur traders, reside in all five communities of the region. The Hareskin Dene called themselves K'a so Got‚Äôine/Katoo Got‚Äôine (\\"big willow people\\") or K‚Äôahsho Got‚Äôine/K'√°shot‚Äô Got‚Äôine (‚Ä≥big-arrowhead-people‚Ä≥, mistranslated as Hareskin people, an English rendering of Gahwi√© Got‚Äôine - ‚Ä≥Rabbit(skin) People‚Ä≥). The D√©line community of the Saht√∫ Dene experienced great loss during Canada's participation in the Manhattan Project. The need for radioactive materials, (such as radium), to create atomic weapons was met with the deposits mined from the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium on Great Bear Lake. The Saht√∫ Dene were hired to transport the ore containing radium from the Northwest Territories to be processed in Ontario or the United States. Since much of the uranium that existed in Europe was under Nazi control, the radium deposits in Canada were vital to the creation of the first atomic bombs. Unaware of the radiation's effects, the Saht√∫ Dene used \\"cloth sacks\\" to transport the ore.The Dene People of Great Bear Lake Call for a Federal Response to Uranium Deaths in DelineDeline Poisoned? Past area mining linked to cancerNuclear Genocide in Canada The number of deaths caused by radiation is disputed by the Government of Canada. The government report says that the people of Deline did not handle yellowcake but sulfur powder.CDUT Final Report Summary Ultimately, the devastating effects of radiation poisoning impacted the D√©line community severely.

Carlingford is 22 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of City of Parramatta. Carlingford is in the Hills Districthttps://www.propertybuyer.com.au/about/where-we-service/the-hills- district and Northern Sydneyhttps://education.nsw.gov.au/public-schools/going- to-a-public-school/finding-a-public-school/contact-metropolitan-north regions. Carlingford is amongst the middle of three different regions of Sydney. The suburb sits in the north-eastern outskirts of the Greater Western Sydney region and is on the south-eastern outskirts of the Hills District and western outskirts of Northern Sydney. The section of Carlingford east of Pennant Hills Road is considered part of the Northern Sydney region, while the rest of the suburb, west of Pennant Hills Road, is referred to as part of The Hills District. History Aboriginal contact References to Aboriginal people in the Carlingford historical record in the 18th, 19th and into the 20th century remain limited to a handful of third party observations, reinterpreted in modern day. There are many historical ambiguities and uncertainties around clan, language and cultural groups of the area. The people of what is now known as Carlingford at the time of the arrival of the First Fleet at Port Jackson in 1788 were the Wallumedegal or Wallumattagai people.Smith, p. 1 The people were observed to live in the area bounded approximately by the Parramatta River in the south, the Lane Cove River in the east, the Parramatta area in the west and ranged north for an uncertain distance.Brook, J. and Kohen, J. L., p. 2 The Wallumedegal appear to have been of the Eora language group.Smith, p. 5 The clan name seems to have been derived from wallumai, the snapper fish, combined with matta, a word used in association with 'place' or sometimes 'waterplace'.Smith, p. 6 Evidence of fire-stick burn off (whereby native vegetation is cleared through fire to create grasslands) along the northern banks of the Parramatta River were observed in February 1788 by an exploring boat party headed by Captain John Hunter and Lieutenant William BradleyJervis, p. 1 in such places which became known as Kissing Point and Meadowbank.Smith, pp. 11‚Äì12 The grasslands created by the Aboriginals' burn off encouraged animals to graze and enhanced the ease of hunting and gathering. Around and above these pastures backing up into the Carlingford area were thick, tall stands of Blue Gum High Forest.Department of the Environment and Heritage, Blue Gum High Forest of the Sydney Basin Bioregion (Commonwealth of Australia, 2005), p. 1 Aboriginal people in the Parramatta area began moving to new areas soon after the arrival of the colonists at Port Jackson. A military post was established at Parramatta in November 1788 which resulted in a group of Burramattagal people moving into Wallumedegal area at Kissing Point.Smith, p. 12 The impact of illness on local people in the immediate years after arrival has been considered to be due to smallpox. Increasingly this belief is questioned as to the feasibility of such an illness being carried for 15 months at sea.Campbell, pp. 39‚Äì50 Early land grants in the Carlingford area in the 1790s included those to Cox, MobbsMobbs, p. 1 and Arndell.Jervis, p. 21, 206 Around 1800 about 100 Aboriginal people were noted as living around Cox's Brush Farm on the Carlingford-Eastwood border.Holt, p. 69 By 1827 the numbers of Aboriginal people in the area were observed to have dropped considerably.Hawkins, p. 28 Colonial period 1788‚Äì1900 =Etymology= The name Carlingford came into use officially on 16 July 1883 for the name of the post office located at Mobbs Hill.This changed the name from 'Mobbs Hill Post Office' which commenced only a couple of weeks earlier on 1 July 1883 [Government Gazette for the year 1883 in four volumes, Vol. III, From 1 July to 30 September (Government Printer, Sydney, 1883), 6 Jul 1883, no.287, p. 3634 (3962)]. The change arose through a request by A. H. McCulloch M.L.A. on behalf of a number of residents [Hopson and Tobin., Vol 3, p.M-28; Pollon and Healy, p. 51] There are varying accounts of how the name Carlingford was suggested. One version was that local Frederick CoxEric Mobbs recounted second hand in 1968 that \\"...a meeting was held in an open paddock where the Memorial Hall ... stands, and it was suggested by Mr Fred Cox that ... \\"Carlingford\\" [be] substituted. He mentioned the area was very much like KA-HAIR-LIN (or Carlingford) in Ireland, 'where the mountains of Mourne lead down to the sea'. The idea was adopted and a petition was immediately drawn up and duly sent to Government, who in turn, promptly adopted it.\\", Mobbs, p. 2 heard one of his employees describe similarities between Mobbs Hill and the town of Carlingford, County Louth, located in the east of Ireland, on the present day border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mason, Thomas H., The Islands of Ireland, BT Batsford Ltd., London, 1936, chapter 1Carlingford in Ireland derived its name from Scandinavian origins, from the time of the Viking invasions and settlements Alternatively, and perhaps a happy alignment with the former version, was that Carlingford was named in honour of Lord Carlingford, who was the British Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies 1847‚Äì1860.Pollon and Healy, p. 51 Prior to 1883 the locality was known under various names and lacked any clear boundaries. The fluidity in district names in the colonial period reflected changes in the patterns of land use and access to the area as the process of colonisation proceeded. Names of nearby areas were sometimes vaguely associated with what became Carlingford and even after that name was settled usage remained fluid for a time. The Ponds referred from 1791 to the nearby valley (later known as Dundas Valley). The Eastern Farms (east of Parramatta) in 1792Pollon and Healy, p. 234 to what became the Ryde district. The Northern Boundary broadly referred to the limits of settlement north of Parramatta and could be used variably to include areas later known as North Rocks, Carlingford, Pennant Hills or North Parramatta.Reed, p. 34, 112 The Field of Mars Common was established in 1804Forsyth (1982), p. 166 in the area to the north west of what was to become Carlingford and the parish of the same name was established in 1821. The name Field of Mars too was used loosely to cover anywhere from Ermington to Epping including Carlingford. Brush Farm House (1820) North Brush was also used variously to identify the bush north of the Parramatta River covering what is now known as West Ryde, Eastwood, Carlingford and Dundas. Brush Farm on the later border between Carlingford and Eastwood took its name from this usage and was applied to the estate (c. early 1800s) and then the house on the land (c.1820s). Mobbs Hill was named after the Mobbs family whose land was nearby. St Paul's Church of England School c.1850‚Äì1870 Pennant Hills referred variously to the ridge from Dundas to Mobbs Hill, the quarry in what is now Dundas Valley and the Government wharf at Ermington (1817). Pennant Hills was used in naming the location of St Paul's Church built on Mobbs Hill in 1850 and the associated denominational school which commenced around the same time. The school occupied purpose built premises next to the church from 1872 (demolished in the 1970s). When the new public school opened in the same building in January 1883 it was called Pennant Hills South Public School, changing its name to Carlingford Public School in 1887, shortly before moving into new premises across the road.Garland, p. 8 By that date, the name Carlingford had become associated with the locality up to North Rocks and Pennant Hills referred to the area beyond. However, when the railway line opened from Clyde to the Carlingford district in April 1896 the station was called Pennant Hills (the station being on Pennant Hills Road) but was later changed to Carlingford in August 1901.Carr, Pullen and McCluskey, pp. 43‚Äì44Forsyth (1982), p. 50 There was another Carlingford railway station earlier on. When the main northern railway line opened in September 1886 what was to become Epping Station (name adopted in July 1899) was called Field of Mars, then Carlingford (adopted in April 1887) with the area between it and the Carlingford district to the west known as East CarlingfordPollon and Healy, pp. 100‚Äì101 after the post office of that name opened in October 1890.Forsyth (1982), pp. 79‚Äì80 The Epping area had also been referred to formerly as Barren Ridges. =Orchard country= The need for food and economic development in the colony expanded white settlement to Parramatta in late 1788. Over the 1790s land grants for farms in the Parramatta area extended to what is now known as the Carlingford district, Kissing Point, North Brush, The Ponds, Field of Mars.McAndrew, p. 22Britton, p. 371 Grants were given to Cox, Mobbs,Mobbs, pp. 1‚Äì2 Arndell and others. Hard labour was required to clear land of the thick bush and then to cultivate, fence and provide housing. Many struggled with low yields of grain, lack of pig, sheep and cattle stock and isolation. Land ownership often turned over many times with larger land owners moving in during the early 1800s including Holt, Barrington, Randal, Kent, Samuel Marsden and John Macarthur.Jervis, p. 206McAndrew, p. 40 Fruit growing had become the primary industry in the area by the 1830s as the larger estates were divided into smaller tenant or owner occupied holdings and a second wave of settlers moved into the area. Orange, other citrus, stone fruit, apple and pear orchards were common interspersed with crops such as potatoes and peas. Familiar names in the district, often from a convict background, had set down roots including the Mobbs, Eyles, Spurway, Sonter and other families. Other economic activity in the districtHibble, p. 281 included timber getting from around 1817 with the government convict sawmill operating until about 1830 at the Pennant Hills Sawing Establishment at Barren Ridges (Epping). Timber was hauled to the Pennant Hills Wharf opened in 1817 at Ermington on the Parramatta River. Timber continued to be cut by private contractors into the 20th century. The Pennant Hills blue metal quarry at Dundas was also active from the 1830s. A public telephone and telegraph service at the Carlingford Post Office began in December 1892Hopson, Vol.1, p.C-8 and gas mains were entering the districtReferences in Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate articles: \\"Dundas Borough Council\\" report, Sat 31 Aug 1889, p. 3; \\"Current news\\", Sat 7 Mar 1891, p. 4; \\"Carlingford: a magnificent residence\\", Sat 11 Nov 1893, p. 8 around the same time. On the eve of Federation, Carlingford was struggling through the great 1890s economic depression but was poised to once again become a prosperous agricultural district. It had a private railway to take goods to market, '... a public school with 235 scholars and staff of six teachers, telephone and money order office, two lines of coaches, five stores, and blacksmith and baker's shop'.\\"Carlingford: The proposed change of name\\", Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Sat 3 Jun 1899, p. 10 After Federation 1901+ =Early century= The new Federated nation of Australia was at war when it came into existence in the new century on 1 January 1901. Some local men were away serving for the British in the Second Anglo-Boer war in South Africa. Locally the failing private railway from Clyde to Pennant Hills had been taken over by the state government. With the latter station renamed Carlingford, the line reopened on 1 August 1901.\\"The Clyde- Carlingford Railway\\", Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Sat 3 Aug 1901, p. 4Carr, Pullen and McCluskey, p. 44 Looking north along Pennant Hills Road from Church Street (now Marsden Road), Mobbs Hill, Carlingford c.1912 Alongside long standing orchards, nurseries and market gardens were increasing in number. While Carlingford was still distinctly rural, technological change in the district continued with the laying of reticulated water mains from 1908,\\"Carlingford, Laying the mains\\", Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Fri 17 Oct 1908, p. 10 establishment of the Pennant Hills Wireless Telegraphy Station (1912, first radio tower demolished 1959;\\"Radio, the Industry of the Future\\", Transit magazine (OTC) June‚ÄìJuly 1959 second radio tower opened 1935Sydney Morning Herald, Sat 22 Jun 1935, p. 15 and demolished 1981), metropolitan water storage reservoir on Mobbs Hill (1916,Sydney Water Web Site, retrieved 4 Sep 2013 1934 and 1970McAndrew, p. 165), extension of telephone lines, arrival of electric power (1922Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Sat 30 Dec 1922, p. 8; Fri 8 May 1925, p. 6), the transition from horse drawn road transport to motorised, the sealing of district roads and eventually sewrage. A sign of progress and modernity was the installation of a public drinking-water fountain in the middle of the road at Mobbs Hill in 1911Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Sat 26 Aug 1911, p. 4 and removed in 1929Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Fri 26 Apr 1929, p. 7 as it had become a hazard to the increased volume of motorised traffic. A Mechanics' Institute and Memorial Hall, designed by Sydney architect and Carlingford resident Lord Livingstone Ramsay, was opened at Mobbs Hill in 1924Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate, Sat 19 Apr 1924, p. 8 (demolished 1987) and was the centre of many social events, political rallies, fetes and school activities. The 1930s Great Depression contracted economic activity and the people of Carlingford struggled on. Owners of farms had relatively easier access to food than labourers. =Children's homes= In April 1923 the Wesley Central Mission/ City Central Methodist Mission established the Dalmar Children's Homes on of land near Marsden Road in the eastern end of the suburb. The property eventually had many cottages, together with a hospital, an orchard and vegetable gardens. The land is now the site of the Alan Walker Retirement Village. The suburb was also home to several homes for children operated by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney since the 1920s: The Church of England Boys' Home, Church of England Girls' Home, and the Havilah Children's Home, Tress Manning Temporary Care, and Field Cottage. Land owned by the homes has since been developed for housing, with street names such as Trigg, Marella, Carramar, Buckland and Lisgar reflecting the names of individual houses or Anglican Home Mission Society services. Boys' Home buildings and grounds are now the regional base and Sydney Australia Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Girls' Home property in the south of the suburb has become, since 1974, Anglicare's Kingsdene Special School for severely to profoundly intellectually disabled children, as well as the American International School. =Urbanisation= Remnant of agricultural past. Mid-19th century slab coach house demolished 1999 As Sydney rapidly expanded, following World War II, Carlingford underwent rapid urbanisation. James Ruse Agricultural High School, established in 1959, is a testament to the agricultural history of Carlingford as well as the rapid pace of urbanisation; which soon made the school, and its large farm, somewhat of an anomaly amongst the 1970s and 1980s housing which dominate the suburb. Soon after James Ruse there followed upper- end housing. An example of which is Carlingford's Calinda Manse, a nine bedroom property. More recently, in the 1990s, the government policy of urban consolidation has seen the development of high-density units and apartment blocks around the town centre and the train station. There have also been redevelopments of older houses into medium-density townhouses, and duplex housing. In 1961, the memorial was unveiled, and stands as a prominent feature in Carlingford, passed by thousands of motorists along Pennant Hills Road each day. The first large shopping centre opened in 1965 as the Carlingford Village on a former orchard and nursery site. After redevelopment in the 1970s it was renamed Carlingford Court. Additional redevelopments of the centre occurred in the late 1990s with further changes when the Myer department store closed on 31 March 2006. The old 19th century and early 20th century shops and houses on the corner of Pennant Hills and Marsden Roads at Mobbs Hill were demolished in the 1970s, and \\"The Orchard\\" shopping centre was built on the site, and after later redevelopment it was renamed as Carlingford Village. The rural guise of the district has largely disappeared: rapid urbanisation, subdivision, population growth and advent of car clogged roads has changed the area completely. Heritage The Carlingford and nearby district hosts a wide range of built and natural heritage sites. These include Aboriginal cultural sites, houses, public buildings, churches, gardens, regeneration sites, industrial, war memorials, road infrastructure and former farm sites. Some of these are formally listed on the NSW State Heritage Register or identified in the NSW State Inventory. Several are also appear on the Register of the National Estate. As with much of suburban Sydney, many sites have been destroyed through years of development or neglect. A handful of Carlingford and district's heritage sites include: * Barrengarry House and outbuildings (c.1888) (now part of James Ruse Agricultural High School) * Blaxland House, Brush Farm (c.1820), 19 Lawson Street, Eastwood * Carlingford Produce Store (1902), 1 Thallon Street, Carlingford (demolished) * Carlingford Public School building and cottage (1887), Marsden Rd, Carlingford * Cemetery (1850), Marsden Road, Carlingford * Old Dundas Quarry (Geological Corridor through Time), Evans Rd, Dundas Valley * Galaringi Reserve, 356 Marsden Road, Carlingford * Lauriston House (mid 1870s), Marsden Road, Dundas * Marsden Road Uniting Church (1865), 203 Marsden Road, Carlingford * Calinda Mansion, (late 1900s), 36 Felton Road, Carlingford * Mobbs Hill Reservoir (1916), 224 Marsden Road, Carlingford * Redstone (aka Winter House) (1935), architect: Walter Burley Griffin, Telopea * Former St Paul's Anglican Church (1850), 346 Marsden Road, Carlingford Carlingford was a favourite spot for the Northwood Group of landscape painters. In the 1930s-1940s this social group would gather to paint outdoors and included Lloyd Rees, Roland Wakelin, John Santry, Marie Santry and George Lawrence.Lloyd Rees in Walton, p. 10 Wakelin completed a number of paintings inspired by the district. Three include: Carlingford Pastoral (1935) incorporates built heritage elements of the Mobbs Hill landscape ‚Äì two water reservoirs, St Paul's Church and the church hall; Afternoon, Carlingford (1949) inspired by Carlingford hills, houses and farms; similarly, House at Carlingford (1950) was inspired by the locale's buildings and land. Commercial areas Carlingford Village shopping centre The major Carlingford shopping and commercial areas are located on Pennant Hills Road. The main, two small to medium-sized shopping centres are Carlingford Court and Carlingford Village, (which has a JUSCO). There are several shopping strips across the suburb, including but not limited to; on the corner of Pennant Hills Rd and Marsden Road ('at the top' of Mobbs Hill), on Pennant Hills Road near Carlingford Railway Station ('at the bottom' of Mobbs Hill), on Mobbs Lane, to the north on Carmen Drive, and Carlingford North shops off North Rocks Rd near Pennant Parade. Carlingford Court (opened in 1965 as \\"Carlingford Village\\") on the corner of Pennant Hills and Carlingford Roads is a medium-sized suburban shopping centre featuring supermarkets, department and variety stores, and specialty shops. Carlingford Village (opened in the 1970s as \\"The Orchard\\" shopping centre) on the corner of Pennant Hills and Marsden Roads on top of Mobbs Hill includes many Asian food outlets. Transport Much of Carlingford has relatively limited public transport access, which is reflected in the low public transport patronage by commuters. At the 2011 census, 18.1% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 64.1% by car (either as driver or as passenger).  Roads  Cumberland Highway, Carlingford At the 2011 census, 64.1% of employed people travelled to work by car: 59.5% as driver and 4.3% as passenger. The Cumberland Highway, a major north‚Äìsouth route through greater Sydney, intersects Carlingford in the form of Pennant Hills Road. As well, many motorists commuting from the Hills District and the growing north-west areas of Sydney travel through Carlingford to the city. The M2 Hills Motorway, part of the Sydney orbital road, runs through northern Carlingford providing a route to the city and North Sydney. Since the Westlink M7 Motorway was finished, completing the Sydney Orbital, it has replaced the Cumberland Highway as the north‚Äìsouth national highway. The area of Carlingford to the east of Pennant Hills Road and North of Carlingford Road, was built mostly in the years, post World War II. There is an area of streets named after famous North African battle fields. Buses There are several bus routes through Carlingford. Major bus stations are located at Carlingford Court Shopping Centre, Carlingford Railway Station and Oakes Road M2 bus stop.

Rail  The end of the line at Carlingford railway station Carlingford railway station was the terminus of the Carlingford Line on the Sydney Trains network. The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 as a private railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901,Bozier, Rolfe, \\"New South Wales Railways: Carlingford Railway Station\\". Retrieved 4 July 2007. was a mostly single-track line. Trains operated as all stops services to Clyde railway station every 30 or 60 minutes, before terminating where passengers would then have to change for a train service to the city. Consequently, the service had low patronage. As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a passing loop was promised for the Carlingford Line with two services per hour all day to become effective in 2010. This was however scrapped in the 2008 mini-budget. A conversion of the Camellia to Carlingford section of the Carlingford railway line to light rail was announced in 2015 as part of the Parramatta Light Rail project. On 5 January 2020, the railway line shut down between Clyde and Carlingford railway stations to commence construction of the Parramatta Light Rail Project, due to be delivered in 2023. A bus service (Route 535) running all stops between Parramatta railway station and ex-Carlingford Railway Station was introduced as a measure to replace the rail service during the construction.http://www.parramattalightrail.nsw.gov.au/news/t6-carlingford- line-close-5-january-2020 Schools Carlingford is the location of a large number of public and private schools. * Carlingford High School *Carlingford Public School (see early school history above under Etymology) *Carlingford West Public School * Cumberland High School * James Ruse Agricultural High School (selective) *Murray Farm Public School *Roselea Public School *St Gerard's Primary Catholic School Places of worship LDS Sydney Australia Temple, Carlingford As with much of northern Sydney, Carlingford also has a comparatively large number of Christian churches of many denominations.

It falls under several Commonwealth (Berowra, Bennelong, Parramatta) and State (Epping, Baulkham Hills, Parramatta electoral divisions/districts. Most of the electoral divisions that Carlingford lies within have historically been held by the Liberal Party of Australia. The exception is the electoral division and district of Parramatta which include sections south of the Parramatta River, making the overall seats more marginal in nature.

The chain was in business for more than 130 years. In 2001, Stern's parent company Federated Department Stores opted to retire the Stern's brand. Most of the stores were immediately converted to Stern's corporate sibling Macy's, with others liquidated and reopened as Bloomingdale's. History Stern Brothers was founded in 1867 by Isaac, Louis and Benjamin Stern, sons of German Jewish immigrants. In that year, they began selling dry goods in Buffalo, New York. From these humble beginnings, the Stern Brothers became an important merchandising family in New York City. The 1985-1996 logo In 1868, they moved to New York City and opened a one-room store at 367 Sixth Avenue. In 1879, the store was again relocated to larger quarters at 110 West 23rd Street. Outgrowing the store at 110 West 23rd Street, Stern Brothers erected a new structure at the same location which became the new flagship store in 1878. It was noted for its cast-iron facade at 32 to 36 West 23rd Street and 23 to 35 West 22nd Street. The building was designed by Henry Fernbach. It was enlarged according to a design by W.M. Schinckel in 1892. The enormous, six-story building was executed in the Renaissance Revival style. W.M. Schinckel's typically 19th century addition tripled the dimensions of the original structure on the eastern portion of the site. The tall central section of this addition animates the long and delicately detailed facade. The company's monogram is still located above the central arch. (This structure is still in use today. The first floor houses a Home Depot, while the upper floors are showrooms.). Many members of the Stern family worked in this store, which carried both luxury goods and merchandise for the working classes. It was an elegant store noted for its fashionable clothes. Ladies from all over the city came to Stern Brothers for their Paris fashions. This enterprise was distinguished by its elegant door men in top hats and the generous and friendly service of the Sterns themselves. Stern Brothers was a family business. The family for decades ran the store and family members filled the many positions in the store. However, Robert (1888-1954), the son of founder Issac Stern, changed his last name to Stearns and founded the investment bank Bear Stearns in 1923. It was not uncommon for customers to be greeted by the brothers themselves. The family was joined by Arthur D. Brandeis in 1914. His daughter, Aliss Ruth had married Irving C. Stern, one of the directors of Stern Brothers and son of founder Louis Stern. Brandeis was president of J. L. Brandeis and Sons of Omaha, Nebraska, the biggest department store west of Chicago. In 1913, Stern Brothers moved farther uptown and built a new flagship store near Fifth Avenue and West 42nd Street across from Bryant Park. The new store had nine floors with the buying offices located in the basement. Stern's catered to the Carriage Trade and had a separate entrance for customers like the Goulds and Astors. Since the store was near the Theater District, many up and coming stars worked in the store. The busy hours of the store were between 11am to 2pm, when local workers from the area were on their lunch break. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, sales began to decline as most white New Yorkers moved to the suburbs. Stern's closed its flagship in New York in 1969 and moved their corporate headquarters to their store in Paramus, New Jersey's Bergen Mall, which became the flagship. By then, Stern's had established a fairly significant retail base in northern New Jersey with stores in various areas including a multi-leveled store in Paterson, New Jersey's downtown that the company bought from the Quackenbush family in the 1950s. The purchase included a second Quackenbush store in the Preakness section of Wayne, New Jersey; in the same year that Stern's moved its base to New Jersey it opened a second location in Wayne that served as the fourth anchor for the newly constructed Willowbrook Mall. Stern's kept both stores in operation, as they were far enough away from each other as to not overlap. Stern's opened a new full line store in the Woodbridge Center Mall in 1971.

There are entrances to the New York City Subway's station and the PATH's station on the second basement level. It is one of the few malls in the city that provides no off-street parking for shoppers. The mall's JCPenney anchor store operated until 2020. History The structure was originally built as the flagship of the Gimbels department store chain. It was designed by famed architect Daniel Burnham and opened on September 29, 1910. The store was located in the cluster of large department stores that surrounded Herald Square, in Midtown Manhattan. It offered of selling space. A major selling point was its many doors leading to the Herald Square New York City Subway station. Due to such easy access, by the time Gimbels closed in 1986, this store had the highest rate of \\"shrinkage\\", or shoplifting losses, in the world. Doors also opened to a pedestrian passage under 32nd Street, connecting Penn Station to the 34th Street (New York City Subway) and 33rd Street (PATH) stations. This Gimbels Passageway was closed in the 1990s for security reasons during a period of high crime. Gimbels closed in 1986. After a renovation, the structure reopened in 1989 as A&S; Plaza, anchored by an A&S; department store. The mall was originally 13 stories high, but difficult access to upper floors made the whole mall a financial failure. A&S; closed in 1995 and the anchor store became Stern's after Federated Department Stores took acquisition of the brand. The structure was renamed Manhattan Mall, due to the closure of A&S.; Stern's closed in 2001, after Federated Department Stores decided to discontinue the brand. Unlike other Stern's stores, the Manhattan Mall location was not converted to a Macy's. Instead, the anchor store was divided into smaller spaces, including a Steve & Barry's and a relocated food court. The upper 10 levels were converted to office space shortly after the closure of Stern's. Venture bought the building in 1999 for $135 million and sold it to Vornado Realty Trust in 2006 for $689 million. On April 18, 2007, JCPenney announced that it would open a anchor store on the lower levels of the mall. It was the first JCPenney store in Manhattan. The mall's food court, which contained the only Arby's restaurant in Manhattan at the time, along with retailers such as Steve & Barry's, Brookstone and Nine West were closed in 2008 to make way for the new store. The store officially opened on July 31, 2009. On July 7, 2020, JCPenney closed permanently as part of a plan to close 151 stores nationwide.https://www.businessinsider.com/jcpenney-closing-more-stores-nyc- addresses-2020-7 File:19100923 Gimbels - The Realization of an Ideal - The New York Times.jpgAdvertisement celebrating the grand opening of Gimbels' flagship store, 1910 File:Manhattan Mall - from 86th floor of the Empire State Building (3810422070).jpgManhattan Mall, seen from the Empire State Building File:Manhattan Mall renovation jeh.jpgUnder renovation File:Manhattan Mall upper floors jeh.jpgFormer shops, now offices References External links * * the Manhattan Mall at New York Architecture Images and Notes Category:Shopping malls in New York City Category:Commercial buildings in Manhattan Category:Shopping malls established in 1989 Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:1989 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Manhattan Mall"},{"id":"655496","text":":EICAR may refer also to the Ecole Internationale de Creation Audiovisuelle et de R√©alisation, an international film school in Paris.

Named for the now-defunct New York Herald, a newspaper formerly headquartered there, it also gives its name to the surrounding area. The bow tie-shaped intersection consists of two named sections: Herald Square to the north (uptown) and Greeley Square to the south (downtown). Description Greeley Square Greeley statue Herald Square proper is the north end of the square between West 34th and 35th streets. The old New York Herald Building was located on the square. The square contains a huge mechanical clock whose mechanical structures were constructed in 1895 by the sculptor Antonin Jean Carles. The monument, known as the James Gordon Bennett Monument consists of the Goddess of Wisdom, Minerva with her owls in front of a bell, flanked by two bell ringers mounted on a Milford pink granite pedestal. The monument's bell was designed to chime on the hour. The two seven-foot-tall bronze laborers, nicknamed Stuff and Guff give the appearance of ringing the bell with their mallets, while in actuality is rung by mallets located behind the bell. The figures and the clock were originally part of the 1894 New York Herald Building that was located at the square. Prior to the demolition of the building in 1921, the figures were removed and reinstalled in the Square in 1940. Greeley Square lies between West 32nd and 33rd streets between Broadway and Sixth Avenue, and is taken up almost entirely by a triangular park. It is named after Horace Greeley, who was the publisher of the New York Tribune, the Herald's rival newspaper. (The two papers later merged to form the New York Herald Tribune.) There is a statue of Greeley inside the park, created in 1890 by Alexander Doyle. The small park is planted with trees and shrubbery, enclosed by a wrought-iron fence, and provided with inviting chairs, tables and a restaurant kiosk. Herald and Greeley Squares stand today as rest areas for the thousands of shoppers that flood the neighborhood, as a lunchroom for thousands of midtown office workers, and as a stage for product launches, musical performances, and photo and film shoots. Shopping New York Herald Building and Herald Square, circa 1895 The area around Herald Square along Broadway and 34th Street is a retail hub. The most notable attraction is the Macy's Herald Square, the flagship department store for Macy's and the largest in the United States. In 2007, Macy's, Inc. moved its corporate headquarters to that store after renaming from Federated. Macy's archrival Gimbels was also located in the neighborhood until 1984; in 1986 the building became the Manhattan Mall.Lueck, Thomas J. \\"Fortune's Smile Glimmers on Herald Sq.\\", The New York Times, September 10, 1989. Retrieved October 20, 2007. \\"Although Macy's survived and has prospered as the Herald Square landmark, Ohrbach's, Korvettes and Gimbels had closed by 1984.... The Herald Center, which opened in 1986 as the city's largest vertical mall, has so far shown little prospect of success.\\" Other past retailers in the area included E.J. Korvette, Stern's, and Abraham & Straus. J.C. Penney opened its first Manhattan flagship store in August 2009 at the former A&S; location inside the Manhattan Mall. The square is roughly equidistant between Madison Square to the south, and Times Square to the north. Herald Square's south side borders Koreatown, at West 32nd Street. Transportation The area is served by the New York City Subway's 34th Street‚ÄìHerald Square station, which is serviced by the . Additionally, the 33rd Street station on the PATH's , , and trains serve the square. Renovation Since 1992, Herald and Greeley Squares have been cared for by the 34th Street Partnership, a Business Improvement District (BID) operating over 31 blocks in midtown Manhattan. The 34th Street Partnership provides sanitary and security services, maintains a horticultural program that includes trees, gardens, and planters, and produces events, product launches, and photo shoots. 34th Street Partnership also added movable chairs, tables, and umbrellas, to the parks. In 1999, the parks were completely renovated by the 34th Street Partnership. Two years later, the partnership added the city's first Automated Pay Toilets in the two squares, one in each square. Since 2008, each square has had a food kiosk operated by sandwich, soup, and salad shop 'wichcraft. In 2009, the 34th Street Partnership converted the parks' Automated Pay Toilets into free public facilities, a rarity in New York City. With the introduction of \\"Broadway Boulevard\\", a 2009 project by the New York City Department of Transportation to increase pedestrian space on the segment of Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets, the passive space provided by Herald and Greeley Squares more than doubled, radically changing the character of the area.Broadway Boulevard I The two blocks of Broadway between 33rd and 35th Streets were completely closed to vehicular traffic, and were made pedestrian-only with bike lanes. The 34th Street Partnership filled the newly pedestrianized space with chairs, tables, umbrellas, and free public programs such as chess tables, dance lessons, and exercise classes. As of April 2013, the boulevard had been redesigned.Broadway Boulevard II Because of the popularity of the pedestrian plaza and bike lanes in Herald and Greeley Squares, the plaza was redesigned again in 2019. Another block of Broadway between 32nd and 33rd Street was shut to vehicular and bike traffic, while 33rd Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue was reopened, and the bike lane through Greeley Square was relocated from Broadway to Sixth Avenue. The Greeley Square restroom was restored in 2020. In popular culture Numerous songs refer to Herald Square, such as: George M. Cohan's song, \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\" (1904), which includes the lyrics \\"remember me to Herald Square\\"; Andrew B. Sterling and Harry Von Tilzer's song, \\"Take Me Back to New York Town\\" (1907); Billy Joel's song, \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" (1978); and Freedy Johnston's song \\"Bad Reputation\\" (1994).

As is emphasized in the text, Ohthere's account was an oral statement, made to King Alfred, and the section dealing with Kvenland takes up only two sentences. Ohthere's information on Kvens may have been second-hand, since, unlike in his other stories, Ohthere does not emphasize his personal involvement in any way. Ohthere's method of locating Kvenland can be interpreted to mean that Kvenland was located in and around the northern part of the modern-day Sweden and in the mid-western part of the modern-day Finland, when the difference in the Viking compass is taken into consideration (see more further below). Other, somewhat later sources call the land adjacent to the northern part of Norway \\"Finnmark.\\"For example Egil's Saga. Ohthere's Finnas may be a reference to the Sami people, but not all historians agree on this.Julku, Ky√∂sti: Kvenland - Kainuunmaa. With English summary: The Ancient territory of Kainuu. Oulu, 1986. Although Ohthere does not give any name for the area where his \\"Finnas\\" lived, he gives a lengthy description of their lives in and around Northern Norway, without mentioning Kvens.Ohthere's description of Sami people. Earlier in the text Ohthere is reported to have said that \\"that land is very long north from thence, but it is all waste, except in a few places, where the Finnas dwell here and there\\". Ohthere's mention of the \\"large [freshwater] meres\\" and of the Kvens' boats are of great interest. The meres are said to be \\"amongst the mountains\\", the words used in the text being geond √æa moras. Ohthere may be referring to the Southern Norwegian lake district, which is also referred to in Orkneyinga saga. This way, the reference would have included Lake Mj√∏sa, an area which is known to have been inhabited at that time: the Orkneyinga saga tells how these inhabitants were attacked by men from Kvenland. The mention of the \\"very light ships\\" (boats) carried overland has a well-documented ethnographic parallel in the numerous portages of the historical river and lake routes in Fennoscandia and Northern Russia. According to the philologist Irmeli Valtonen, \\"[the] text does not give us a clear picture where the Cwenas are to be located though it seems a reasonable conclusion that they lived or stayed somewhere in the modern-day areas of Northern Sweden or Northern Finland.\\"Irmeli Valtonen: A Land beyond Seas and Mountains: A Study of References to Finland in Anglo- Saxon Sources. A paper in the book Suomen varhaishistoria [Proto-history of Finland]. Edited by Ky√∂sti Julku. Rovaniemi 1992. The name \\"Kven\\" briefly appears later in King Alfred's Orosius. The Kven Sea is mentioned as the northern border for the ancient Germany, and Kvenland is mentioned again, as follows: > ... the Swedes (Sweons) have to the south of them the arm of the sea called > East (Osti), and to the east of them Sarmatia (Sermende), and to the north, > over the wastes, is Kvenland (Cwenland), to the northwest are the Sami > people (Scridefinnas), and the Norwegians (Nor√∞menn) are to the west.Cf. > Geography of Alfred The term Sarmatism was first used by Jan D≈Çugosz in his 15th century work on the history of Poland.Andrzej Wasko, Sarmatism or the Enlightenment: The Dilemma of Polish Culture, Sarmatian Review XVII.2. D≈Çugosz was also responsible for linking the Sarmatians to the prehistory of Poland, and this idea was continued by other chroniclers and historians such as Marcin Bielski, Marcin Kromer and Maciej Miechowita. Miechowita's Tractatus de Duabus Sarmatiis became influential abroad, and for some time it was one of the most widely used reference works on the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Viking compass is believed to have had a 45 degree rotation of cardinal points.See e.g. Weibull, Lauritz. De gamle nordbornas v√§derstrecksbegrepp. Scandia 1/1928; Ekblom, R. Alfred the Great as Geographer. Studia Neuphilologia. 14/1941-2; Ekblom, R. Den forntida nordiska orientering och Wulfstans resa till Truso. F√∂rnv√§nnen. 33/1938; Sk√∂ld, Tryggve. Isl√§ndska v√§derstreck. Scripta Islandica. Isl√§ndska s√§llskapets √•rsbok 16/1965. If the territories listed in King Alfred's Orosius are examined with that in mind, the Norwegians would be to the northwest of Sweden, and the Sami people would be to the north. These points are correct after rotation based on the difference between the Viking and modern compasses. Kvenland is then situated to the northeast of Sweden and might be placed somewhere around the present-day Swedish Norrland or the western part of the present-day Finland. The information of Kvenland being situated \\"over the wastes\\", northwards from the Viking-period \\"Sweden\\" (corresponding roughly to the south-central part of present-day Sweden) matches the idea of Kvenland extending to Norrland. There is no \\"Finland\\" mentioned anywhere either in the original or the updated version of Orosius' history. Hversu Noregr byggdist and Orkneyinga saga Three medieval Icelandic accounts discuss Kvenland. They are Egils saga and the more legendary Hversu Noregr byggdistHversu Noregr byggdist. See also original text. and Orkneyinga saga.Orkneyinga saga. See also original text. According to Hversu Noregr byggdist, Kvens made sacrifices to Thorri, who \\"ruled over Gothland, Kvenland (K√¶nlandi) and Finland.\\" According to Orkneyinga saga, Fornj√≥t was \\"a king\\" who \\"reigned over Gotland, which we now know as Finland and Kvenland.\\" A DNA study conducted on the prehistoric skeletal remains of four individuals from Gotland supports the area having been ethnically interconnected with Finland and Kvenland during the primeval era, just as suggested by Hversu Noregr byggdist and Orkneyinga saga: > \\"The hunter-gatherers show the greatest similarity to modern-day Finns\\", > says Pontus Skoglund, an evolutionary geneticist at Uppsala University in > Sweden.DNA study published in nature.com on April 26, 2012. Pontus Skoglund > on prehistoric Gotlanders: \\"The hunter-gatherers show the greatest > similarity to modern-day Finns.\\" Recent archaeological discoveries made in Finland have further emphasized the close ties between Gotland and modern-day Finland during the primeval era. In the late spring of 2013, a Merovingian period (600-800 AD) silver plate, believed to be a piece of a sword scabbard, was discovered in Rautj√§rvi, Finland. The origin of the silver plate has been traced to Gotland, based on its style of ornamentation. According to Jukka Luoto of the Museum of South Karelia, \\"this indicates that these areas have independently conducted trade with Gotland.\\"Yle News, \\"Amateur archaeologists have made huge discoveries during the springtime,\\" published on June 4, 2013 (in Finnish).Yle News, \\"Mystical silver plate discovered in Rautj√§rvi may change history writing,\\" published on May 30, 2013 (in Finnish). Orkneyinga saga contains a realistic description of N√≥r traveling from Kvenland to Norway. Based on the saga's internal chronologies, this would have happened around the 6th or 7th century CE, but the dating is very insecure. Locations of Kvenland, Finland and Gotland are given rather exactly: > \\"to the east of the gulf that lies across from the White Sea (Gandv√≠k); we > call that the Gulf of Bothnia (Helsingjabotn).\\"The text in the original > language. The saga is correct in placing the Gulf of Bothnia \\"across\\" (i.e., \\"on the other side of\\" the isthmus between the two seas) from the White Sea. The saga does not say that Kvenland was on the coast, but just east of the Gulf.A possible location of Kvenland and N√≥r's route to the fjord of Trondheim. Kvenland can be placed elsewhere east of Gulf of Bothnia, as well. The selected location on the map is the one with most archaeological finds. Most interpretations locate Kvenland in the less well researched northern coastal area on the Bothnian Bay. Kvenland in 814 AD. Old Norse sagas suggest that Kvenland covered the entire Fennoscandian area. This is how N√≥r started his journey to Norway: > But Nor, his brother, waited until snow lay on the moors so he could travel > on snow-shoes. He went out from Kvenland and skirted the Gulf, and came to > that place inhabited by the men called Sami (Lapps);It is not sure if this > is a reference to Sami people or some other group. Finnic-based \\"Lapp\\" does > not appear in any other saga. It became a common name for Sami people only > later in Middle Ages, and Norwegians never really adopted it. that is beyond > Finnmark. Having traveled for a while, N√≥r was still \\"beyond Finnmark.\\" After a brief fight with Sami people (Lapps), N√≥r continued: > But Nor went thence westward to the Kjolen Mountains and for a long time > they knew nothing of men, but shot beasts and birds to feed to themselves, > until they came to a place where the rivers flowed west of the mountains. -- > Then he went up along the valleys that run south of the fjord. That fjord is > now called Trondheim. Starting somewhere on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, N√≥r had either gone all the way up and around the Gulf, or skied across; it was winter, and the gulf might have been frozen.Olaus Magnus map of Scandinavia 1539 CE . Taking benefit from the frozen Gulf of Bothnia was still habitual in the 16th century, as described in the map, see section F. N√≥r ended up attacking the area around Trondheim in central Norway and later the lake district in the south, conquering the country and uniting it under his rule. There is no mention of Kvenland after that. Again only a handful of words are devoted to Kvenland, mainly telling where it was. N√≥r's journey from Kvenland to Norway is missing from Hversu, which in fact does not even mention that N√≥r came from Kvenland at all, only stating: \\"Norr had great battles west of the Keel\\". The journey may have been lifted from some other context and added to Orkneyinga saga in a later phase by an unknown author who wanted to make the saga more adventurous. Egil's saga Egils saga is an epic Icelandic saga possibly by Snorri Sturluson (1179‚Äì1241 CE), who may have written it between 1220 and 1240 CE. The saga covers a long period, starting in Norway in 850 CE and ending around 1000 CE. It contains a short description of Egil's uncle Thorolf Kveldulfsson co-operating with a Kvenland king, Faravid, against invading Karelians. Rather accurate geographical details about Kvenland's location are given in chapter XIV:Egil's Saga, Chapter XIV > Finmark is a wide tract; it is bounded westwards by the sea, wherefrom large > firths run in; by sea also northwards and round to the east; but southwards > lies Norway; and Finmark stretches along nearly all the inland region to the > south, as also does H√•logaland outside. But eastwards from Namdalen > (Naumdale) is J√§mtland (Jamtaland), then H√§lsingland (Helsingjaland) and > Kvenland, then Finland, then Karelia (Kirialaland); along all these lands to > the north lies Finmark, and there are wide inhabited fell-districts, some in > dales, some by lakes. The lakes of Finmark are wonderfully large, and by the > lakes there are extensive forests. But high fells lie behind from end to end > of the Mark, and this ridge is called Keels. Like Hversu Noregr byggdist, Egils saga clearly separates Finland and Kvenland, listing them as neighboring areas. However, Finland is not listed in any of the saga's surviving versions, indicating that it might be a later addition by someone who did not recognize Kvenland any more. The saga says \\"eastwards from Namdalen is J√§mtland\\", but actually the direction is southeast. Also H√§lsingland is southeast, not east, of J√§mtland. Since it is widely assumed that the Viking compass had a 45 degree rotation of cardinal points, the saga's \\"east\\" seems to correspond to the contemporary southeast. In chapter XVII Thorolf goes to Kvenland again:Egil's Saga, Chapter XVII > That same winter Thorolf went up on the fell with a hundred men; he passed > on at once eastwards to Kvenland and met king Faravid. Had Thorolf gone up to the mountains around his homeland Namdalen and then straight \\"eastwards\\", i.e., southeast, he would have first reached J√§mtland and then H√§lsingland. These are the same lands that were listed earlier in the saga. If the passage about going \\"southwest\\" is taken literally and directly, continuing from H√§lsingland across the Gulf of Bothnia Thorolf would have arrived in the southwestern tip of present-day Finland, the center of Finland's Viking period population (see map). Again, as with Ohthere, Sami people and Kvens are not discussed at the same time. The saga tells how Norwegians taxed the Sami people,Egil's Saga, Chapter X but there is no indication in the saga that the Kvens would have competed with the Norwegians for control of the Sami or lived near or among them. Much debate has taken place concerning whether the saga provides truthful information of Iron Age Kvenland by mentioning that the Kvens had a real-sounding 'king' and a 'law' to divide the loot. The saga places the confrontation of Norwegians and Karelians in the 9th century. Other sources Besides Old English Orosius, Hversu Noregr byggdist, Orkneyinga saga and Egil's saga, Kvenland or Kvens are very briefly mentioned in four Icelandic texts from the same era. One of the texts may have been written in Norway.  Norna-Gests √æ√°ttr  Norna-Gests √æ√°ttr has a brief mention of the king of Denmark and Sweden, Sigurd Hring (ruling in the mid-8th century), fighting against the Curonians and the Kvens: > Sigurd Ring (Sigur√∞r) was not there, since he had to defend his land, Sweden > (Sv√≠√æj√≥√∞), since Curonians (K√∫rir) and Kvens (Kv√¶nir) were raiding > there.Norna-Gests √æ√°ttr, chapter 7. . See also English translation.  Historia Norwegiae  Historia Norwegiae was written sometime between 1160 and 1175 CE in an unknown location. It contains a list of peoples in the North: > But towards north many pagan tribes‚Äîalas!‚Äîstretch from the east behind > Norway, namely Karelians (Kiriali) and Kvens (Kw√¶ni), corneous Sami people > (cornuti Finni) and both peoples of Bjarmia (utrique Biarmones). But what > tribes dwell behind them, have we no certainty.Storm, Gustav. Monumenta > Historica Norwegiae, pages 73-75. See also page 204. Translation provided > here is by the author of the article. Icelandic Annals The Icelandic Annals have a late mention of Kvens clearly active in the North.

Germania According to Finnish historian Ky√∂sti Julku the Germanic tribe Sitones mentioned in Tacitus' Germania in 98 CE lived in the area in northern Fennoscandia claimed to be Kvenland, saying \\"There can be no confusion about the geographical location of the Sitones.\\" Different interpretations Kvenland and Kainuu Kvenland has generated many theories about its origin, the location of Kvenland east of the Bay of Bothnia has, however, been an unchanging feature of most interpretations since the 17th century, when the Swedish historians Johannes Messenius and Olaus Rudbeckius first noted the concept of Kvenland in Old Norse sources. In 1650, Professor Michael Wexionius from Turku became the first to associate Kvenland with the Finnish Kainuu. In the 18th century the Finnish historian Henrik Gabriel Porthan, among others, focused attention on the Ohthere passage mentioning the Cwenas. Whereas Porthan suggested that the ancient Kvens may have been Swedish, many others came to view the Kvens as an ancient Finnish tribe.Tacitus' Germania.Julku, Ky√∂sti: Kvenland - Kainuunmaa. With English summary: The Ancient territory of Kainuu. Oulu, 1986. See pages 11-24. Nowadays Kainuu is a name of an inland province in northeastern Finland. In the past the name Kainuu was often used of the more western coastal area around the Bay of Bothnia, even up to the 19th century. In the early Umesaami dictionaries the terms Kainolads and Kainahalja described Norwegian and Swedish men and women respectively.Lexicon Lapponicum, 1768 Kvenland and Pohjola In a theory somewhat closely related to the Kainuu theory, Kvenland has also been associated with the legendary Pohjola. Pohjola is an other- worldly country in Finnish mythology, ruled by a fierce witch called Louhi. Pohjola is best known from the Kalevala, a 19th-century Finnish work of epic poetry compiled by Elias L√∂nnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology, collected largely in the Finnish region of Kainuu. Different interpretations of the origins of the mythical Pohjola exist. Some include parts of Lapland and the ancient Kainuu (same as Kvenland according to common view today) in Kalevala's Pohjola. Some point out a similarity with the name Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia in English), a region in western Finland. Other interpretations An original view has been provided by a Finnish historian and Helsinki University professor, Matti Klinge, who has placed Kvenland/Kainuu not only in southern Finland, but around the Baltic Sea as a kind of Finnish-Swedish \\"maritime confederation\\". Klinge has presented a hypothesis of Kvenland as a naval power on the Baltic, located on both the present-day Finnish and Swedish sides of the Gulf of Bothnia as well as in some of the surrounding areas.Klinge, Matti. Muinaisuutemme merivallat (1983). The book is in Finnish, also published in Swedish as √ñstersj√∂v√§rlden (1984) and in English as Ancient Powers of the Baltic Sea (2006). The folklorist and professor of literature V√§in√∂ Kaukonen calls it \\"fantastic fabulation\\" and a \\"dream-wish\\".Kaukonen, V√§in√∂: Kalevala L√∂nnrotin runoelmana II. Tosiasioita ja kuvitelmia. [The Kalevala as an epic of Elias L√∂nnrot. Facts and imaginations.] Snellman-instituutin julkaisuja 7. Kuopio 1988. See pages 200‚Äì209. However, Professor Emeritus in Archeology at the University of Turku, Unto Salo has also concluded that \\"Kvens/Kainulainens\\" were men of Satakunta in Southern Finland.Unto Salo, Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen rautakaudella (Faravid 27/2003) There is archeological evidence linking Satakunta and Lapland (for example types of skis) but skipping the areas between which suggests that expeditions were undertaken from Satakunta to the North during the late Viking Age. Further, toponomy suggests that there were regular routes used by the people of Satakunta to get to the North. Lastly, haapio, a type of a very light dugout boat was used extensively in Satakunta and would have been ideal for such expeditions. Unto Salo speculates that the name Haaparanta (\\"Aspen shore\\") in the Northern Sweden (county of Norrbotten) would have been given due to presence of asps needed to build haapios. Originally Kvenland was more likely situated in the Southern-Ostrobothnia but when this habitation disappeared in the early 9th century for unknown reasons, the Norwegians continued to apply the term Kven to the men of Satakunta and H√§me who inherited the Northern trade and taxation. Pentti Virrankoski, Kainu - Pohjanmaan rautakautinen kansa (Faravid 2/1978) Woman Land Different views exist of why ancient scholars have made references to Kvenland as an area dominated by women. Some have suggested that there may have been misinterpretations of terminology. Whatever the etymological origin of the element kven, it effortlessly translates to \\"woman\\" in Old Norse. Proto- Germanic *kwin≈çn, *kun≈çn, *kwƒìni-z and *kwƒìn≈ç for \\"woman\\" developed into kona, kv«ün, kvƒÅn, kv…îÃÑn, kvendi, kvenna and kvinna in Old Norse.Etymology of kwen. It is plausible that this led learned speakers of Old Norse to identify Kvenland with the land of the Amazons in Greek legend; Adam of Bremen, for example, often mentions Amazons in writing of the far North.Rudolf Simek, \\"Monstra septentrionalia: Supernatural Monsters of the Far North in Medieval Lore\\", in Imagining the Supernatural North, ed. Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough, Danielle Marie Cudmore, and Stefan Donecker, Edmonton: University of Alberta, 2016, , pp. 55‚Äì75, pp. 60‚Äì61, 65‚Äì66. Among sources used in the related debate by historians is the following statement of Tacitus from c. 98 CE: > \\"Upon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in all > other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is > exercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from a > state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage.\\" According to a view shared by many historians, the term Sitones (Kvens) shares etymological roots with Sigtuna, which much later had a Latin spelling Situne.Svenskt Diplomatorium I nr 852. Originalbrev. Pope Alexander III's address to king Knut Eriksson and Jarl Birger Brosa in the 1170s.Heinrich Gottfried Reichard took this view in his edition of the Germania; Pauly's Real-Encyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft in alphabetischer Ordnung, ed. August Pauly, Christian Walz and W.S. Teuffel, Volume 6.1 Pra - Stoiai, Stuttgart: Metzler, 1852, , p. 1226 Charles Anthon, A classical dictionary containing an account of the principal proper names mentioned in ancient authors and intended to elucidate all the important points connected with the geography, history, biography, mythology, and fine arts of the Greeks and Romans: Together with an account of coins, weights, and measures, with tabular values of the same, New York: Harper, 1841, repr. 1869, , p. 1244. According to Disas saga, the Sitones were ruled by a queen. According to a common view, the \\"queen\\" of the Sitones either derives from or is a possible linguistic confusion of an Old Norse term used for \\"woman\\", which shares linguistic origins with the term used in reference to the Kvens.Gudmund Sch√ºtte, tr. Jean Young, Our Forefathers, the Gothonic Nations: A Manual of the Ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian Peoples, Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1929-33, , p. 126.Gwyn Jones, A History of the Vikings, 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University, 1984, , pp. 24-25. According to Thomas William Shore, the English language term \\"queen\\" derives from the term \\"qwen\\", a spelling used for the Kvens e.g. by Wulfila in c. 352 CE and King Alfred the Great of Wessex in c. 890 CE.Origin of the Anglo-Saxon Race. Thomas William Shore. First edition, 1906. Reissued by Kennikat Press, 1971. In 1075 AD, in Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, the German chronicler Adam of Bremen calls Kvenland Women's Land, stating the following: > Meanwhile Swedes (Sueones), who had expelled their bishop, got a divine > revenge. And at first King's son called Anund, whose father had sent him to > enlarge his kingdom, after arriving to Women's Land (patriam feminarum), > whom we consider to be Amazons, was killed along with his army from poison, > that they had mixed to the spring water. (III 15) > \\"After that come the Swedes (Sueones) that rule wide areas up until the > \\"Land of Women\\" (terram feminarum). Living east of these are said to be > Wizzi, Mirri, Lamiy, Scuti and Turci up until the border of Russia > (Ruzziam).\\" (IV 14) In the related debate references are sometimes also made to the Finnish epic Kalevala, according to which Pohjola was ruled by a woman called Louhi or Pohjan-akka. The ancient Norse knew the Northern ruler-goddesses by the names g√Ωgjar (singular: g√Ωgr) and √≠vi√∞jur (singular: √≠vi√∞ja). There is also a reference to a northern land of women in an Icelandic manuscript from the 14th century, which describes a kuenna land (\\"woman land\\"). Different theories on the origins of the Kvens In 1958, a Finnish historian, politician and University of Helsinki professor, Kustaa Vilkuna, suggested that Kainuu or Kvenland was originally in Southern Finland, on the Gulf of Bothnia and covering just northern Southwest Finland and coastal Satakunta.Vilkuna, Kustaa. Kvenland. Miss√§ ja mik√§? (1958). Book is in Finnish, Swedish translation published in 1969. A small local area called as \\"Kalanti\\" (Kaland in Swedish) would have been a remnant of the earlier name Kvenland. Because of the trading and tribute-taking expeditions as well as settlement expansion of the kainulaiset, the territorial concept of Kainuu was gradually moved northward. Another mid-20th-century historian, Professor Jalmari Jaakkola, considered the Kvens or kainulaiset as long-range hunters and tribute-takers coming from Upper Satakunta, from the inland region surrounding the present- day city of Tampere.Jaakkola, Jalmari: Suomen varhaishistoria. [Proto-history of Finland]. Helsinki 1935, second edition 1958 This theory was supported by Professor Armas Luukko.Pohjois-Pohjanmaan ja Lapin historia II [History of Northern Ostrobothnia and Lapland, II.] Oulu 1954. In 1979, Professor Pentti Virrankoski of the University of Turku presented a hypothesis according to which Kainuu was originally the sedentary Iron Age settlement in Southern Ostrobothnia. After the settlement was supposedly destroyed by tribal warfare during the early 9th century, the kainulaiset became dispersed along the western coasts of Finland, leaving only place-names and some archaeological finds as permanent traces.A paper by Pentti Virrankoski in the journal Faravid, 1979. In 1980, the University of Oulu professor Jouko Vahtola pointed out that there is no evidence of the name Kainuu being of Western Finnish origin and considered it to have Eastern Finnish roots. However, he suggested a common Germanic etymology for the names Kainuu and Kvenland. Like most of his predecessors, Vahtola viewed Kainuu/Kvenland as the name of the coastal Ostrobothnia, meaning roughly \\"low-lying land\\". Based on the archaeological knowledge of the north, Vahtola did not believe that there was a separate Iron Age tribe called Kvens. He considered the Kvens to be mainly Tavastians hunting and trading in northern Ostrobothnia, thus partially reproducing the view of Jaakkola and Luukko (Upper Satakunta being a part of traditional Tavastia).Vahtola, Jouko. Tornionlaakson historia I. Kveenit, kainulaiset. Malungs boktryckeri AB, Malung, Sweden. 1991. See page 216. This theory is nowadays widely adopted in Finland, Sweden and Norway, and it is cited in many studies and popular works. In 1995 the Finnish linguist Jorma Koivulehto gave support for the theory of common etymological roots of the names Kainuu and Kvenland. He suggests a new etymology meaning roughly \\"marine gap-land\\", the \\"marine gap\\" being the northern sea-route on the Bothnian Gulf.Jorma Koivulehto. Ala-Satakunnan Kainu ja pohjoisen Kainuu. [The Kainu of Western Satakunta and the Kainuu of the north.] A paper in the book Kielen ja kulttuurin Satakunta. 1995. Increasing archaeological fieldwork in northern Finland has cast some doubts on the idea of Kvenland having almost no sedentary settlements. Encouraged by the new findings, Professor Ky√∂sti Julku of Oulu University presented a theory of the Kvens being early permanent Finnish inhabitants of Northern Finland and Norrbotten (a part of modern-day Sweden). Some Swedish historians have suggested that the ancient Kvens were actually a Scandinavian and not a Finnish group, but these views have little support nowadays. The Swedish archaeologist Thomas Wallerstr√∂m suggests that the Kvens/kainulaiset was a collective name for several Finnic groups participating in the west-east fur-trade, not just southern Finns but ancestors of Karelians and Vepsians as well. In this case, the land of the Kvens would have extended from the Bothnian Gulf in the west to the Lake Onega in the east.Thomas Wallerstr√∂m: Norrbotten, Sverige och medeltiden.

Kvenland and Kvens later in historical time In 1328, T√§lje Charter (\\"T√§lje stadga\\") - the oldest known record written in Swedish - mention the Birkarls (\\"bircharlaboa\\"). Based on the information revealed, the Birkarls then inhabited areas, e.g., in Northern H√§lsingland, which covered the western coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and from there all the way up and around the gulf to Oulu River. T√§lje Charter is a state treaty ratified between the Kvens and the Swedish crown, in which the king of Sweden guarantees the Birkarl Kvens trading and tax-collecting rights as chief enforcement officers (Swedish term: Fogde) in the North.Schefferus bok LAPPONIA (LAPPLAND), published in 1673 in Latin. A translation from Latin last printed in 1995 by Wallerstr√∂m in Sweden. Page 48. In his 1539 map Carta Marina, Swedish Olaus Magnus places Birkarl Kvens (\\"Berkara Qvenar\\") on the Norwegian North Atlantic coast, roughly in the middle in between the archipelago of Lofoten and the modern-day city of Troms√∏. In his 1555 Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus (A Description of the Northern Peoples), he also mentions both terms: the Finnish traders who commuted between and inhabited the general area of Tornio and the modern-day area of Norway are said to have been called Kvens.Vahtola, Jouko. Tornionlaakson historia I. Kveenit, kainulaiset. Malungs boktryckeri AB, Malung, Sweden. 1991. The earliest remaining Norwegian tax records, stored at the National Archival Services of Norway (Riksarkivet), dating to the mid-16th century, also mention Kvens.Niemi, E. (1994).

Today, the term Kven is used in Norway in reference to the descendants of Finnish-speaking people who have inhabited or migrated to the present-day area of Norway anytime before World War II. Migration waves from the 16th century onward have brought Finnish settlers to Northern Norway from the modern-day areas of Northern Sweden and Northern Finland, mostly from the northern coastal areas of the Bay of Bothnia. Modern reappearance of the terms \\"Kvenland\\" and \\"Kvens\\" Repeated claims about there in mediaeval times having existed a country named Kvenland, populated by a Finnish-speaking people named Kvens, have reappeared in modern times in northern Sweden and northern Finland, amid claims that the \\"Kvens\\" not only are an indigenous people in northern Sweden and Finland, but the indigenous people there. Claims that are directly connected to a struggle over the rights to hunt and fish in very large areas in northern Fennoscandia, between the Sami people, who are the recognised indigenous people of the area, and the Swedish- and Finnish-speaking population there. There are, however, no documented or in any other way proven connection between the people in northern Sweden and Finland who now claim to be Kvens, and the geographical area, and people who lived there, that in mediaeval times were referred to as Kvenland and Kvens.Myten om kv√§nernas rike.

Life and career He was born in Northumberland, the son of a doctor, and the brother of historian Hugh Trevor-Roper. The Telegraph. Retrieved 2 February 2020 He was educated at Charterhouse, the University of Cambridge and the Westminster Medical School. During World War II he served in the Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps in the Mediterranean. After the war he became a specialist in ophthalmic surgery, and divided his working life between work in public hospitals and a lucrative private practice in London. In 1955 Trevor-Roper agreed to appear as a witness before the Wolfenden Committee, which had been appointed by the British government to investigate, among other things, whether male homosexuality should remain a crime. He was one of only three men who could be found to appear as openly gay witnesses before the Committee. The others were the journalist Peter Wildeblood, who had been convicted of a homosexual offence, and Carl Winter, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum. Trevor-Roper told the Wolfenden Committee that the majority of gay men led normal and well-adjusted lives, posed no threat to children or public morality, and that homosexuality was not a physical or mental illness. He pointed out that the existing laws did nothing but encourage blackmailers. He argued that the age of consent should be lowered to 16, and told the committee that many young gay men committed or attempted suicide because of isolation or depression induced by homophobia. These were highly controversial views in the 1950s. Trevor-Roper's testimony helped persuade the Committee to recommend that male homosexuality should be decriminalised, which was finally done, after a long political struggle, in 1967. Trevor-Roper remained an active gay rights activist, campaigning in particular for the abolition of the discriminatory age of consent laws. The 1967 law set the age of consent for male homosexuals at 21, while the heterosexual age of consent was 16. When the AIDS epidemic appeared in the early 1980s, Trevor-Roper was one of the founders of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the United Kingdom's leading AIDS service organisation, which held its first meeting at his home. The other cause to which Trevor-Roper devoted himself was better access to ophthalmic medicine, both in the United Kingdom and in African countries. He campaigned successfully for the repeal of British laws which prevented the sale of cheap spectacles, against the resistance of the opticians' lobby. In 1983, he helped finance Peter Risdon in his successful challenge to the opticians' monopoly in the UK, a challenge that led directly to the legalisation of the sale of reading glasses without prescription. He founded the Haile Selassie Eye Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and assisted in the founding of similar hospitals in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. In 1945, Trevor-Roper's friends Edward Sackville-West, artist and art dealer Eardley Knollys and the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor jointly bought Long Crichel House, a Georgian rectory in Long Crichel, Dorset. Trevor-Roper lived there for a time and along with his friends established \\"one of the last great post-war salons, hosting guests including Sybil Colefax, Anthony Asquith, Graham Sutherland, Lord Berners, Nancy Mitford, Benjamin Britten, Laurie Lee, Ben Nicolson, Cecil Day-Lewis and Graham Greene.\\" Fight for your rights - Friends of Friendless Churches. Retrieved 8 October 2020 Trevor-Roper was a lover of architecture and active in heritage conservation causes in the United Kingdom at a time when this was not a fashionable cause.. He was a founding Trustee of the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust and his house was used as the office for the Thirties Society - later the Twentieth Century Society, which he helped to found. In his 1970 book The World Through Blunted Sight, he explored how faulty or failing eyesight affected the style and technique of writers and artists. Looking at the effects of myopia, cataracts, colour blindness, squints and total blindness he speculated on what the impact would have been on artists had they worn glasses.Trevor-Roper, Patrick (1970) The World Through Blunted Sight: An inquiry into the influence of defective vision on art and character.

They descended from Finnish peasants and fishermen who emigrated from the northern parts of Finland and Sweden to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1996, the Kvens were granted minority status in Norway, and in 2005 the Kven language was recognized as a minority language in Norway. Name The origin of the term Kven is disputed. There is no evidence that modern Kvens are descendants of the Kvens mentioned in a few ancient Norwegian and Icelandic sources. As a result of Norway signing the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 1999, the term Kven became for the first time an official name, the name of Finnish descendants with a long history in Norway who view themselves as a member of that particular ethnic minority group of Finnish descent. There is a theory among some academic groups that due to the discrimination and suppression by the Norwegian authorities the term Kven became derogatory in the late 19th century. Therefore, many Kvens preferred to be called 'kainulaiset'.http://www.kvenskinstitutt.no/kvener/kainulaiset-eli- kvaanit/Kenneth Hyltenstam & Tommaso Maria Milani: Kvenskans status: Rapport f√∂r Kommunal- og regionaldepartement och Kultur- og kirkedepartement. 2003 But with the revitalization of the Kven culture in the 1970s, Kvens themselves started using the term. However, even in the 1990s there was a debate whether the Norwegian terms 'finne', 'finsk', or 'finsk√¶tted' (respectively a Finnish person, Finnish, and of Finnish origin) should be used instead.Olsen, V.

However, today the term Kven is accepted and used, for example, in the name of the Kven organization in Norway (Norske Kveners Forbund). Demographics The Kvens were registered as a separate group in the Norwegian censuses in the period 1845 to 1930. From the 18th century the Kvens started to comprise a significant part of the population in Northern Norway. In 1845 13.3% of the population in Finnmark, and 3.2% in Troms, considered themselves as Kvens. In 1854 the numbers increased to respectively, 19.9% and 7.0%. The peak was in 1875, with respectively 24.2% and 7.7%. The ratios were reduced to respectively 20.2% and 3.7%, in 1890, and 13.8% and 2.0% in 1900 (all numbers from).Niemi, E. (1978), Den finske kolonisasjon av Nordkalotten ‚Äì forl√∏p og √•rsaker. Ottar, 103. 49-70. In the 1930 census there were 8,215 registered Kvens in Troms and Finnmark. In 1950, 1,439 people reported that they used the Finnish language in Troms (58 people) and Finnmark (1,381 people). In 2001, the number of Kvens was estimated to be about 10,000 to 15,000 in a parliamentary inquiry on national minorities in Norway. However, estimating the number of Kvens is difficult since there is no official definition of a Kven. Therefore, other studies have estimated the number of Kvens to be about 50,000‚Äì60,000, based on the criteria that at least one grandparent spoke Kven.Saressalo, L. (1996), Kveenit. Tutkimus er√§√§n pohjoisnorjalaisen v√§hemmist√∂n identiteetist√§. Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seuran Toimituksia, 638. Helsinki. But many of these may consider themselves to be Norwegian or Sami or a combination. History Danish/Norwegian tax records from the 16th century already list some Kvens living in North Norway.Niemi, E. (1994), Kvenene og staten ‚Äì et historisk riss. I: Torekoven Str√∏m (ed.), Report from the seminar ‚ÄùKvenene ‚Äì en glemt minoritet?‚Äù Monday 14.11.94 at the University of Troms√∏/ Troms√∏ Museum. Also, the famous map of Scandinavia by Olaus Magnus from 1539 shows a possible Kven settlement roughly in between today's Troms√∏ and Lofoten named \\"Berkara Qvenar\\". Kvens of this time are often connected to the birkarl organization in northern Sweden.Vahtola, Jouko. Tornionlaakson historia I. Birkarlit, 'pirkkalaiset'. Malungs boktryckeri AB. Malung, Sweden. 1991. In some early documents Kvens are also grouped together with the Sami people, who are the indigenous people of Central and Northern Norway.Peter Schnitler. . Volume I-III. Editors J. Qvigstad, K. B. Wiklund, Lars Ivar Hansen and Tom Schmidt. 1929. The main immigration of Kvens to Norway can be divided into two periods. The first immigration was from about 1720 to 1820, when Finnish speaking people from the northern Finland and Torne River Valley moved to river basins and fjord-ends in Troms and the western parts of Finnmark, to places such as Polmak, Karasjok, Porsanger, Alta and Lyngen. The second immigration was after 1820 until about 1890 to the coastal areas of eastern Finnmark, motivated by the booming fishing industry in Northern Norway. In addition, it was also easier to get to America from there than from Northern Finland and many moved to Finnmark before continuing over the Atlantic. Migration ended from problems in the fishing industry, population pressure, migration to America and increasing problems for Kven in buying land and getting Norwegian citizenship. Language The Kven language is a Finnic language. From a linguistic point of view, Kven is a mutually intelligible dialect of Finnish, but for political and historical reasons, it received in 2005 status of a legal minority language in Norway, within the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Kven differs from Finnish since the Kven population was in effect isolated from other Finnish-speaking people. The Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian loanwords, and Finnish words that are no longer used in Finland are still used. In a 2005 government report, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used. Ethnic controversies In the 1990s there was a debate among Kvens whether they should be considered as an ethnic group of their own, or whether they were Finnish Norwegians. As well, during the process of legal recognition of the Kven language, there was a debate as to whether it should be considered an actual language or merely a dialect of Finnish, and whether the Kven language or Kven dialect of Finnish should be taught in schools. Kven and Sami people share a common history of Norwegianization. However, post-Norwegianization policies have treated them differently. Sami people have been recognized as the indigenous people in Northern Norway. They have their own schools and parliament, and they elect three of the six members for the board of Finnmark Estate (the organization owning about 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark). Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the Sami people too much, whereas on the Sami side there are people who think the Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the Sami people. Lately, the Norwegian Kven Organization has attempted to get the Kvens recognized, similarly to the Sami people, as an indigenous people in Norway. This has made it important for some Kvens to show that their history stretches further back in time than commonly believed. There has been some recent unofficial adoption of the word \\"Kainu\\" as the new name for \\"Kven\\", in accordance with the hypotheses put forward by Finnish historians Jouko Vahtola and Ky√∂sti Julku. Vahtola has hypothesized that words \\"Kven\\" and \\"Kainu(u)\\" are interchangeable. Modern recognition The flag of Kvenland was hoisted at the Kiruna City Hall in Sweden on March 16, 2013, at 11:00, in celebration and honor of the first annual Day of the Kvens. Hereafter, that date - March 16 - is meant to be recognized wider in the Kven communities of the north, and by others as well. The date for the occasion was chosen from the 14th century signing of a state treaty between Sweden and Kvenland, known as T√§lje Charter (\\"T√§lje stadga\\" in Swedish). In that treaty, the king of Sweden guaranteed the Kvens (\\"Birkarls\\") trading rights in the north (translation from Latin last printed in 1995, Wallerstr√∂m, page 48).T√§lje stadga (Translation from Latin). Wallerstr√∂m, 1995. Sweden. The city of Kiruna is a part of the Kiruna Municipality. It is the northernmost municipality of Sweden, and geographically it is Sweden's largest, covering roughly 4.604% of the total area of Sweden. In the past, the Kven language spoken in Norway was considered a dialect of Finnish language, much like the Finnic Me√§nkieli language spoken in northern Sweden. Today, both are officially recognized minority languages in the areas where the languages are spoken. The Finnish, Me√§nkieli and Sami all are officially recognized minority languages in the Kiruna Municipality in Sweden. Culture and media Ruijan Kaiku Ruijan Kaiku is a bi-lingual newspaper (Kven/Finnish and Norwegian) that is published in Troms√∏, Norway. Currently one issue is published each month. The newspaper writes mostly about Kven issues, and about the work of strengthening Finnish language and culture in Norway. In addition the paper has stories about other Finnish organizations in Norway, and about other Finnish minorities in the Nordic and surrounding countries. The newspaper's Chief editor is Liisa Koivulehto. Baaski festival Baaski is a Kven culture festival held in Nordreisa. The first festival was in June 2007, but it is intended to be an annual event. The responsible organizers is Nordreisa municipality, and the first festival director was Johanne Gaup. Kven costume In the late 1990s a Kven costume was designed. It is not a reconstruction of an old costume, but rather a new design based on pictures and other sources about the clothing and jewelry used by Kvens in the late 19th and early 20th century. The purpose of creating the costume was to unify and strengthen Kven identity. Kadonu Loru Kadonu Loru is the only pop music single ever recorded in the Kven language. It is based on an old Kven nursery rhyme about making sausages. The artists are Karine Jacobsen and Kine Johansen respectively from B√∏rselv and Lakselv. The single was published by Iƒëut. Organisations and institutions The Norwegian Kven organization The Norwegian Kven Organization (Ruijan Kveeniliitto in Kven/Finnish and Norske Kveners Forbund in Norwegian) was established in 1987, and has currently about 700 members. The organization has local branches in: Skibotn, B√∏rselv, Nord-Varanger, Tana, Lakselv, Alta, northern Troms, Troms√∏, and √òstlandet. The tasks of the organisation include working for a government report about the history and rights of the Kven population, improving the media coverage of Kven issues, and for the Norwegian government to establish a secretary (statssekret√¶r) for Kven issues. In addition, reading and writing classes at the beginner to advanced level, establishing a Kven kindergarten, and to incorporate the Kven language in all education levels in Norway. Also, to establish a Kven culture fund, road and other signs in Kven, Kven names in official maps, and museums and centers for Kven language and culture. The Kven institute The Kven institute (Kainun institutti in Kven/Finnish and Kvensk institutt in Norwegian) is a center for Kven culture and language located in B√∏rselv in Porsangi (Porsanger) municipality in Norway. Kven Language Board The Kven Language Board that was established in April 2007. It consists of the leader Irene Andreassen, Terje Aronsen, Prof. Anna Riitta Lindgren, Assoc.

It is noted for its large yellow flower head. The names \\"wolf's bane\\" and \\"leopard's bane\\" are also used for another plant, aconitum, which is extremely poisonous. Arnica montana is used as an herbal medicine for analgesic and anti-inflammatory purposes, but there is insufficient high-quality clinical evidence for such effects. Description Arnica montana Arnica montana is a flowering plant about tall aromatic fragrant, perennial herb. Its basal green ovate-cilitate leaves with rounded tips are bright coloured and level to the ground. In addition, they are somewhat downy on their upper surface, veined and aggregated in rosettes. By contrast, the upper leaves are opposed, spear-shaped and smaller which is an exception within the Asteraceae. The chromosome number is 2n=38. The flowering season is between May and August (Central Europe). The hairy flowers are composed of yellow disc florets in the center and orange-yellow ray florets at the external part. The achenes have a one-piece rough pappus which opens in dry conditions.Arnica montana L., relevant European medical plant (2014). Waizel-Bucay J., Cruz-Juarez M. de L. Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales, Vol. 5 Issue 25 p. 98-109 Arnica montana is a hemicryptophyte, which helps the plant to survive the extreme overwintering condition of its habitat. In addition, Arnica forms rhizomes, which grow in a two-year cycle: the rosette part grows at its front while its tail is slowly dying. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.Archibald William Smith Distribution and habitat Distribution map of Arnica montana. Arnica montana is widespread across most of Europe. It is absent from the British Isles and the Italian and Balkan peninsulas.http://euromed.luomus.fi/euromed_map.php?taxon=416903&size;=medium In addition, it is considered extinct in Hungary and Lithuania. Arnica montana grows in nutrient-poor siliceous meadows or clay soils. It mostly grows on alpine meadows and up to nearly . In more upland regions, it may also be found on nutrient-poor moors and heaths. However Arnica does not grow on lime soil, thus it is an extremely reliable bioindicator for nutrient poor and acidic soils. It is rare overall, but may be locally abundant. It is becoming rarer, particularly in the north of its distribution, largely due to increasingly intensive agriculture and commercial wild-crafting. Nevertheless, it is cultivated on a large scale in Estonia. Chemical constituents Chemical structure of helenalin The main constituents of Arnica montana are essential oils, fatty acids, thymol, pseudoguaianolide sesquiterpene lactones and flavanone glycosides. Pseudoguaianolide sesquiterpenes constitute 0.2‚Äì0.8% of the flower head of Arnica montana. They are the toxin helenalin and their fatty esters. 2,5-Dimethoxy-p-cymene and thymol methyl ether are the primary components of essential oils from both the plant's roots and rhizomes. Cultivation Arnica montana fruits and seeds Arnica montana: Photo taken at Botanical Garden in Erlangen, Germany. Arnica montana is propagated from seed. Generally, 20% of seeds do not germinate. For large scale planting, it is recommended to raise plants first in a nursery and then to transplant them in the field. Seeds sprout in 14‚Äì20 days but germination rate depends highly of the seed quality. Planting density for Arnica montana is of 20 plants/m2 such that the maximum yield density will be achieved in the second flowering season. While Arnica montana has high exigencies of soil quality, analyses should be done before any fertilizer input.B.M.Smallfield & M.H. Douglas (2008) Arnica montana a grower‚Äüs guide for commercial production in New Zealand. New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research Limited The flowers are harvested when fully developed and dried without their bract nor receptacles. The roots can be harvested in autumn and dried as well after being carefully washed. Arnica montana is sometimes grown in herb gardens. Use in herbal medicine Historically, Arnica montana has been used as an herbal medicine for centuries. Traditional uses for the plant are similar to those for willow bark, with it generally being employed for analgesic and anti-inflammatory purposes. Clinical trials of Arnica montana have yielded mixed results: * When used topically in a gel at 50% concentration, A. montana was found to have the same effectiveness (albeit with possibly worse side effects) as a 5% ibuprofen gel for treating the symptoms of hand osteoarthritis. * A 2014 systematic review found that the available evidence did not support its effectiveness of A. montana at concentrations of 10% or less for pain, swelling, and bruises. A. montana has also been the subject of studies of homeopathic preparations. A 1998 systematic review of homeopathic A. montana conducted at the University of Exeter found that there are no rigorous clinical trials that support the claim that it is efficacious beyond a placebo effect at the concentrations used in homeopathy. Toxicity The US Food and Drug Administration has classified Arnica montana as an unsafe herb because of its toxicity. It should not be taken orally or applied to broken skin where absorption can occur. Arnica montana contains the toxin helenalin, which can be poisonous if large amounts of the plant are eaten or small amounts of concentrated Arnica are used. Consumption of A. montana can produce severe gastroenteritis, internal bleeding of the digestive tract, raised liver enzymes (which can indicate inflammation of the liver), nervousness, accelerated heart rate, muscular weakness, and death if enough is ingested. Contact with the plant can also cause skin irritation. In the Ames test, an extract of A. montana was found to be mutagenic. Market The demand for A. montana is 50 tonnes per year in Europe, but the supply does not cover the demand. The plant is rare; it is protected in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and in some regions of Switzerland. France and Romania produce A. montana for the international market.Pasquier, B., Godin, M. (2014) L‚Äôarnica des montagnes, entre culture et cueillette. Dossier simple et aromatique, Jardins de France 630. Changes in agriculture in Europe during the last decades have led to a decline in the occurrence of A. montana. Extensive agriculture has been replaced by intensive management.Michler, B.

In animals, it normally is accomplished by taking in a substance through the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract; such as through eating or drinking. In single-celled organisms ingestion takes place by absorbing a substance through the cell membrane. Besides nutritional items, substances that may be ingested include medication (where ingestion is termed oral administration), recreational drugs, and substances considered inedible; such as foreign bodies or excrement. Ingestion is a common route taken by pathogenic organisms and poisons entering the body. Ingestion can also refer to a mechanism picking up something and making it enter an internal hollow of that mechanism, e.g. \\"a grille was fitted to prevent the pump from ingesting driftwood\\". Pathogens Some pathogens are transmitted via ingestion, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Most commonly, this takes place via the faecal-oral route. An intermediate step is often involved, such as drinking water contaminated by faeces or food prepared by workers who fail to practice adequate hand-washing, and is more common in regions where untreated sewage is common. Diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route include hepatitis A, polio, and cholera. Some pathogenic organisms are typically ingested by other routes. * Larvae of the parasite Trichinella encyst within muscles and are transmitted when a new host eats the infected flesh of a former host animal. * The parasite Dracunculus is ingested in drinking water, which is contaminated with larvae released as the parasite emerges from the host's skin. * The bacterium Salmonella most commonly infects humans via consumption of undercooked eggs. Foreign objects Foreign body in esophagus Disk batteries, also called button cells, are often mistakenly ingested, particularly by children and the elderly. They may be mistaken for a medication pill because of their size and shape, or they may be swallowed after being held in the mouth while the battery is being changed. Battery ingestion can cause medical problems including blocked airway, vomiting, irritability, persistent drooling, and rash (due to nickel metal allergy). Abnormal ingestion Pica is an abnormal appetite for non-nutritive objects or for food items in a form not normally eaten, such as flour. Coprophagia is the consumption of feces, an abnormal ingestive behavior common in some animals.

A member of the National Consortium for Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS), it is a statewide public magnet school. Tenth- grade students are selected to attend through a competitive application process that includes standardized test scores, a written application, and an interview. The school enrolls students in the last two years of high school graduating over 100 students each year. The class of 2016 produced 11 National Merit Semifinalists. While the main academic focus of MSMS is mathematics and science, humanities, particularly history, literature, and art are also emphasized. History Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science (MSMS) was founded in 1987 by appropriations from the Mississippi Legislature and was the fourth public, residential high school for academically gifted students created in the United States. As a public, residential high school, drawing students from all over the state, MSMS has occasionally struggled for existence. The property tax has been the sole form of finance for most schools in Mississippi. However, MSMS which draws students from all over the state, cannot levy a millage tax as a source of funding. It relies on grants as well as state, student, and alumni contributions. Starting in 2008, the Mississippi Legislature required MSMS and its sister school, the Mississippi School of the Arts, to charge students $500 per semester for room and board costs, making them the only public schools in the state that charge students to attend. However, if a student is eligible for free or reduced lunch in their home district, then this fee is waived.

The name Raskolnikov derives from the Russian raskolnik meaning \\"schismatic\\" (traditionally referring to a member of the Old Believer movement). The name \\"Rodion\\" comes from Greek and indicates an inhabitant of Rhodes. Raskolnikov is a young ex-law student living in extreme poverty in Saint Petersburg. He lives in a tiny garret which he rents, although due to a lack of funds has been avoiding payment for quite some time. He sleeps on a couch using old clothes as a pillow, and due to lack of money eats very rarely. He is handsome and intelligent, though generally disliked by fellow students. He is devoted to his sister (Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova) and his mother (Pulkheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova). Plot  An impoverished student with a conflicted idea of himself, Raskolnikov (Rodya as his mother calls him) decides to kill a corrupt pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, with whom he has been dealing, with the idea of using the money to start his life all over, and to help those who are in need of it. It is later revealed that he also commits the murder as justification for his pride, as he wants to prove that he is \\"exceptional\\" in the way Napoleon was. He commits the murder, but is so nervous during the crime that he makes a few mistakes, and is afraid that he will be caught. Raskolnikov finds a small purse on Alyona Ivanovna's body, which he hides under a rock without checking its contents. His grand failure is that he lacks the conviction of his beliefs to accomplish greatness, and thus declines into madness. After he confesses to the destitute, pious prostitute Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, she guides him towards admitting to the crime, and he confesses to Porfiry Petrovich, a prosecutor with a keen psychological sense (the book implies the policeman suspected him from the start). Raskolnikov is sentenced to exile in Siberia, accompanied by Sofya Semyonovna, where he experiences a mental and spiritual rebirth. The idea of rebirth is not supported in the text. He is clearly unrepentant, still holding to the fancy that he had some right to act as he did, that, had he been made of the right stuff, he would not have failed in his project. Garnett's translation concludes: Cinema In film, Raskolnikov was portrayed for the first time by Gregori Chmara in the silent adaptation Raskolnikov, directed by Robert Wiene (1923). He was portrayed by Peter Lorre in Josef von Sternberg's Hollywood film version (1935), by John Hurt in a 1979 BBC mini-series adaptation, by Patrick Dempsey in a 1998 television movie, and by John Simm (2002), Crispin Glover (2002) and Ilya Kremnov (2005). The character of Michel in Robert Bresson's Pickpocket (1959) is based on Raskolnikov. Paul Schrader, who wrote Taxi Driver (1976), was in turn inspired by Bresson's Michel character to create Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro's antihero. Woody Allen's 2005 British psychological thriller Match Point is a debate with Crime and Punishment: protagonist Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) early on is seen reading the book and identifying with Raskolnikov.Goyios, Charalampos Living Life as an Opera Lover: On the Uses of Opera as Musical Accompaniment in Woody Allen's Match Point, Senses of Cinema, Issue 40. Retrieved 21 January 2012. He is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both policemen play cat and mouse with the suspect. His 2015 drama-thriller Irrational Man is also inspired by Crime and Punishment, with protagonist Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix) as its Raskolnikov character.

(Note the white screen background color.) The Commodore SX-64, also known as the Executive 64, or VIP-64 in Europe, is a portable, briefcase/suitcase-size \\"luggable\\" version of the popular Commodore 64 home computer and the first full-color portable computer.Commodore SX-64 Portable The SX-64 features a built-in five-inch composite monitor and a built-in 1541 floppy drive. It weighs (). The machine is carried by its sturdy handle, which doubles as an adjustable stand. It was announced in January 1983 and released a year later, at 995 USD ().Commodore SX-64 portable computer \\"[Don Richards, Commodore USA president,] also said that the SX-64 computer, a $995 portable version of the Commodore 64 with built-in color monitor, has been a sellout everywhere.\\"  Description  Aside from its built-in features and different form factor, there are several other differences between the SX-64 and the regular C64. The default screen color is changed to blue text on a white background for improved readability on the smaller screen. This can cause compatibility problems with programs that assume the C64's default blue background. The default device for load and save operations is changed to the floppy drive. The Datasette (cassette) port and RF port were omitted from the SX-64. Because it has a built-in disk drive and monitor, Commodore did not perceive a need for a tape drive or television connector. However, the lack of a Datasette port poses a problem for a number of C64 Centronics parallel printer interfaces, since several popular designs \\"borrowed\\" their +5V power supply from the port. This was not an issue for later interfaces which were supplied with an AC adapter power supply, or those which can use the +5V line supplied by the Centronics port (Pin #18) on the printer itself, if the printer implements it. Alternatively, a +5V supply is also available from the joystick ports. The audio/video port is still present, so an external monitor can still be used; it and the built- in monitor display the same content. Differences electrically and in placement on the board, means that there are compatibility problems with some C64 cartridges. The original SX-64's (built in) power supply limits the machine's expandability. Compatibility with Commodore RAM Expansion Units varies. Early SX-64 power supplies cannot handle the extra power consumption from the REU. The physical placement of the cartridge port can prevent the REU from seating properly. The 1700 and 1750, 128K and 512K units intended for the C128, are said to work more reliably with the SX-64 than the 1764 unit that was intended for the regular C64. Some SX-64 owners modify Commodore REUs to use an external power supply in order to get around the power supply issues. A version of the SX-64 with dual floppy drives, known as the DX-64, was announced, but the press reported by early 1985 that plans for its release had been suspended. A few have been reported to exist , but it is very rare. Instead of an extra floppy drive, a modem could also be built in above the first drive. Some hobbyists installed a second floppy drive themselves in the SX-64's empty drive slot. Later models of the SX-64 use the larger power supply intended for use with the DX-64. A version with a monochrome screen called the SX-100 was announced but never released. History The SX-64 did not sell well, and its failure has been variously attributed to its small screen, high weight, poor marketing, and smaller business software library than that of its competitors, which included the Osborne 1 and Kaypro II (Zilog Z80 CPU, CP/M OS) and Compaq Portable (16-bit CPU, MS-DOS). The exact number of SX-64 sold from 1984 to 1986, when it was discontinued, is unknown. The serial numbers of over 130 SX-64s from series GA1, GA2, GA4, GA5 and GA6, with serial numbers ranging over 49,000 for series GA1, 1,000 for GA2, 17,000 for GA4, 11,000 for GA5, and 7,000 for GA6 have been reporteddatabase at SX64.net Some would-be buyers waited instead for the announced DX-64, which never became widely available due to the slow sales of the SX-64, creating a Catch 22 situation similar to that endured by Osborne after announcing an improved version of its computer. The SX-64 did however gain a following with user groups and software developers, who could quickly pack and unpack the machine to use for copying software or giving demonstrations. Reception Ahoy! favorably reviewed the SX-64, stating that the keyboard was better than the 64's, the monitor \\"isn't hard to read at all\\", and the disk drive was durable enough for travel. While criticizing the lack of any provision for internal or external battery power, the magazine concluded that the average $750-800 retail price was \\"worth every penny!\\".

He is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, having cultivated a legacy over a career spanning more than three decades. He has held the WCW World Heavyweight Championship six times, WCW International World Heavyweight Championship twice, NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship twice and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four-times. Sting is widely known for his time spent as the public face of two major American professional wrestling promotions: the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which displaced the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as the leading professional wrestling organization in the United States from 1995 to 1998, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Sting's 14-year association with WCW and its predecessor, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), began in 1987. He quickly rose to main event status and has been described as the WCW counterpart to the WWF's Hulk Hogan. Dubbed \\"The Franchise of WCW\\", he held a total of 15 championships in the promotion ‚Äì including the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on six occasions, the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions, and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one occasion ‚Äì and made more pay-per-view (PPV) appearances for the company than any other wrestler. Against 'Hollywood' Hulk Hogan, Sting headlined the highest-grossing PPV event in WCW history, Starrcade, in December 1997. Upon the acquisition of WCW by the WWF in March 2001, Sting and his long-term rival Ric Flair were chosen to perform in the main event of the final episode of Nitro. Following the expiration of his contract with WCW's parent company, AOL Time Warner, in March 2002, Borden held talks with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion and instead toured internationally with World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) ‚Äì winning the WWA World Heavyweight Championship ‚Äì before joining the then-upstart TNA in 2003. Over the following 11 years, he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one further occasion and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four times. As a result, he became the only wrestler to have won the NWA, WCW, and TNA world championships in a career. He was also the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2012. Previously described by WWE as the greatest wrestler never to have performed for that promotion, Sting finally joined the company in 2014, making his first appearance at Survivor Series and having his debut match at WrestleMania 31 the following year. His last ever professional wrestling match came at Night of Champions in September 2015, which also marked his sole WWE pay-per-view main event and WWE World Heavyweight Championship contest for the organization. Sting headlined the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016 on April 2, where he announced his retirement. His induction renders him the first performer to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Hall of Fame, as well as the second man to be inducted while an active WWE wrestler, after Ric Flair. Sting held 25 total championships throughout his career, including 21 between WCW and TNA. Readers of Pro Wrestling Illustrated named him \\"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\\" on four occasions, a record he shares with John Cena. In 2016, Sting was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Slam! Sports wrote that he holds \\"a lofty level of prestige that few will ever touch\\".  Early life  Borden was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Southern California.Wrestling Legend Sting on How it all Began and Turning Down the WWE Sportsvibe.co.uk. April 21, 2011; retrieved December 19, 2014. He played football and basketball in high school and later embarked on a career in bodybuilding, once co-owning a Gold's Gym health club. Borden had no interest in professional wrestling and no television access to it within his home community, but decided to pursue a career in the industry after being taken to an \\"incredible\\" World Wrestling Federation (WWF) event in Los Angeles where he saw Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik, The British Bulldogs, Andr√© the Giant and others perform.  Professional wrestling career   Continental Wrestling Association (1985‚Äì1986)  Borden, originally wrestling under the ring name Flash, teamed with Jim \\"Justice\\" Hellwig (who would gain fame as The Ultimate Warrior in WWF/WWE) as two members of Power Team USA in independent All- California Championship Wrestling. Power Team USA was a four-man unit also featuring Garland \\"Glory\\" Donahoe and Mark \\"Commando\\" Miller, plus manager Rick Bassman.PWI Centrefold: Sting, Pro Wrestling Illustrated May 1988 Hellwig and Borden later moved to the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), a wrestling company based in Memphis, Tennessee, and became known as the Freedom Fighters.PWI Centrefold: The Ultimate Warrior, Pro Wrestling Illustrated October 1988 Fans were slow to respond to the lumbering hulks, so the team turned heel.Molinaro, page 196. The Freedom Fighters left the CWA after an uneventful run, the highlight of which was an angle in which they broke the leg of veteran wrestler Phil Hickerson.  Universal Wrestling Federation (1986‚Äì1987)  The duo surfaced in the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), an organization run by Bill Watts and based in Alexandria, Louisiana where they were known as the Blade Runners. Borden changed his ring name from Flash to Sting, while Hellwig became known as Rock. They soon joined Hotstuff & Hyatt International, a heel stable headed by \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert and Missy Hyatt. Together with \\"Russian\\" wrestler Kortsia Korchenko, the Blade Runners became henchmen in Gilbert's on-screen feud with Watts. Hellwig left the promotion in mid-1986, leaving Sting without a partner. Sting won the UWF World Tag Team Championship twice with Gilbert in 1986 and a third time with Rick Steiner in 1987. Following a match against Terry Taylor in mid-1987, Gilbert interfered on Taylor's behalf, costing Sting the match. Taylor and Gilbert ganged up on Sting until Gentleman Chris Adams came to Sting's aid. Adams cleared the ring and then asked Sting if he was with him or against him in his feud with Taylor and Gilbert. Sting turned face by declaring his allegiance to Adams. Behind the scenes, Gilbert endorsed Borden by telling a dirt sheet that Sting would be a megastar in the future. Later that year, Sting was tabbed to win the UWF Television Championship, then held by Gilbert, until Jim Crockett of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) bought the company from Watts. Crockett's booker, Dusty Rhodes, decided to put the Television title on Taylor to set up a feud between Taylor and NWA Television Champion Nikita Koloff to unify the two titles. Rhodes used then-unknown Shane Douglas as the transitional champion from Gilbert to Taylor because Rhodes did not want to diminish Sting's growing stardom with a brief title run.  Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1987 - 2001) = Rise to stardom (1987‚Äì1989) = Sometime after Sting's arrival to the NWA in July 1987, Dusty Rhodes used the opening bout of Crockett's first foray into pay- per-view, Starrcade '87, to showcase the young superstar. Sting partnered with Michael P.S. Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in a six-man tag team match against Gilbert, Steiner, and Larry Zbyszko that ended in a 15-minute time-limit draw. Having established himself as a rising star, Sting was one of the few UWF alumni to be pushed in the NWA. At Clash of the Champions I in March 1988, Sting challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The match ended in a draw after the 45-minute time limit expired and the ringside judges could not declare a winner.Molinaro, page 197. Sting lost to Flair in several non-televised rematches following the Clash and, later that year, battled other members of Flair's stable, the Four Horsemen. Sting teamed with Koloff at The Great American Bash in July 1988 to challenge Horsemen Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship; Blanchard and Anderson retained the titles when the match ended in a 20-minute time- limit draw. Rhodes continued to book Sting in title matches throughout the year against both NWA United States Champion Barry Windham and NWA Television Champion Mike Rotunda. In the fall of 1988, Sting was attacked by Hawk and Animal of The Road Warriors after a televised match. Rhodes, as booker, identified Sting as the face who was most over with the fans, despite knowing that turning the Road Warriors heel would be no easy task. Rhodes himself teamed with Sting to challenge the Road Warriors for the tag team championship at Starrcade '88 that December. Rhodes and Sting got the win by disqualification, allowing the Road Warriors to retain the titles. Sting returned to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He would also have his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey at Nippon Budokan in June 1989. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great Muta challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in a disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title. In the main event of that year's Great American Bash, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Terry Funk, who was a member of Gary Hart's J-Tex Corporation. After Flair got the victory, he was attacked by Funk's stablemate, Muta. Sting came to the aid of his old rival Flair, and the two feuded with Muta and Funk for the rest of the summer and fall, culminating in a Thunderdome Cage match between the two teams, which Flair and Sting won, at Halloween Havoc '89. The alliance with Flair resulted in Sting joining the newly reformed and now-face Four Horsemen along with the Andersons, Arn and Ole (kayfabe cousins). Sting finished out the year by winning a four-man round-robin Iron Man tournament at Starrcade '89. In the final match of the night, Sting defeated Flair to accumulate the necessary points to win the tournament. The victory made Sting the number one contender for Flair's NWA World title, leading to tension within the Four Horsemen. = Feud with The Four Horsemen (1990‚Äì1991) = Sting was summarily dismissed from The Four Horsemen on February 6, 1990, at Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout after refusing to relinquish his title shot against Flair, thus restarting their rivalry. Later that evening, Borden suffered a legitimate knee injury while interfering in a steel cage match featuring the Horsemen. Borden's injury forced the bookers of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the dominant promotion in the NWA, to find a new opponent for Flair for the forthcoming WrestleWar pay-per-view event. Lex Luger was chosen to challenge Flair at WrestleWar. During the match between Flair and Luger, Sting came down to motivate Luger to come back and beat Flair. Before this Sting and Luger had been at odds. When Luger was close to winning Sting was attacked by Ole Anderson. Luger opted to save the already injured Sting and ended up losing the match by count-out while assisting his friend. Behind the scenes, WCW officials had wanted Flair to drop the title to Luger at WrestleWar, but Flair refused, saying he had promised Borden he would hold the title until Borden could return to the ring. Despite the injury, Sting was still utilized on television and pay per views when necessary. At the Capital Combat event in May, Sting was accosted by the Four Horsemen and thrown into a metal cage at ringside. In a promotional crossover, Sting was rescued by his buddy RoboCop. After Borden's recovery, Sting finally defeated Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on July 7, 1990, at The Great American Bash. Sting went on to feud with title contenders Flair and Sid Vicious. Vicious appeared to defeat Sting in a title match at the 1990 Halloween Havoc, but the \\"Sting\\" that Vicious pinned was revealed to be an impostor played by Horseman Barry Windham. The real Sting appeared soon after and pinned Vicious to retain his title after the match was restarted. During Sting's title run, a masked man known as The Black Scorpion would taunt and attack Sting on many occasions. This feud culminated in a final showdown between Sting and The Black Scorpion at Starrcade: Collision Course in December. The cage match ended with Sting pinning and unmasking the Scorpion, who turned out to be Flair in disguise. = WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1991‚Äì1993) = Sting in his surfer gimmick Sting's first world championship reign ended January 11, 1991, when Flair defeated him in a rematch from Starrcade. In the same month, WCW seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance, in the process of recognizing a WCW World Heavyweight Championship and a WCW World Tag Team Championship. Sting then took part in what many consider to be the best match of 1991, teaming with Luger to face The Steiner Brothers at the SuperBrawl I pay-per-view for the world tag-team titles. The Steiners won by pinfall after Koloff, who had been feuding with Luger, interfered in the match by swinging a chain at Luger but hitting Sting instead. Consequently, Sting feuded with Koloff throughout the summer of 1991. In August 1991, Sting defeated Steve Austin to win a tournament for the vacated WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Sting held the title for 86 days before losing it to Rick Rude at Clash of the Champions XVII. At Starrcade '91, Sting won the first-ever Battlebowl battle royal, for which he received a Battlebowl championship ring. Sting then became embroiled in a feud with the Dangerous Alliance, headed by manager Paul E. Dangerously. The stable targeted Sting because he was the so-called \\"franchise\\" of WCW, and the Alliance vowed to destroy both Sting and the promotion he was the face of. At the same time, Sting was being targeted by Luger, who had once again turned heel and, as WCW Champion, viewed Sting as a threat. Sting engaged in many matches with Dangerous Alliance members, especially Rude, who was the group's biggest star. It was during this feud that Sting won the first of his six WCW World Heavyweight Championships, defeating Luger on February 29, 1992, at SuperBrawl II. The feud ended when Sting formed Sting's Squadron, consisting of allies Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes, Windham, and Koloff, and defeated the Alliance (Rude, Austin, Arn Anderson, Zbyszko, and Bobby Eaton) in a WarGames match at WrestleWar in May 1992. Dave Meltzer awarded the match his highest rating of five stars. Near the end of Sting's battles with the Dangerous Alliance, the seeds were sown for what became arguably one of the most famous feuds of Sting's career. Sting defended his WCW World title on April 12, 1992, at The Omni in Atlanta against the 450-pound Big Van Vader. During the match, Vader splashed Sting, cracking three of Sting's ribs and rupturing his spleen. Sting recovered and defended his title on July 12 against Vader at The Great American Bash, dropping the belt to Big Van Vader after missing a Stinger Splash, hitting his head on the ring post, and receiving a powerbomb. After beating Cactus Jack in a Falls Count Anywhere Match at Beach BlastFoley, Mick. Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.223) and WCW newcomer Jake Roberts in a Coal Miner's Glove match at Halloween Havoc, Sting defeated Vader, who had lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in August, in the \\"King of Cable\\" tournament final at Starrcade. The Sting-Vader feud continued into 1993, with Vader, who was again WCW World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Sting in a bloody Strap match at SuperBrawl III. Sting exacted revenge by beating Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on March 11 in London, England, but lost it back to Vader six days later in Dublin, Ireland. Sting then teamed with WCW newcomer Davey Boy Smith to beat the team of Vader and Vicious at Beach Blast in a match that was set up by a mini-movie in which an evil midget blew up Sting's boat. At the end of 1993, Sting was one of the first people to congratulate Flair, who had just returned from the World Wrestling Federation, after his WCW World Heavyweight Title victory over Vader at Starrcade. = WCW International World Heavyweight Champion (1994‚Äì1995) = Sting feuded with Vader and Rude through the first half of 1994. Sting won the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship from Rude in April. Rude recaptured the title on May 1 at Wrestling Dontaku 1994 in Japan, but the decision was reversed because Rude had allegedly hit Sting with the title belt during the match; this was to cover for a real-life back injury Rude sustained in the match that forced Rude into retirement. Sting refused to have the title handed to him and instead defeated Vader for the vacant WCW International World Heavyweight Championship at Slamboree. Soon afterward, Flair defeated Sting in a title unification match at Clash of the Champions XXVII, turning heel in the final moments of the match when Sensuous Sherri turned on Sting and took Flair's side. Sting spent the second half of 1994 and most of 1995 teaming with new arrival Hulk Hogan in his battles against Kevin Sullivan's Three Faces of Fear and its successor stable, The Dungeon of Doom. At The Great American Bash 1995, Sting defeated Meng to win another tournament for the WCW United States Championship. Sting defeated Meng in a rematch for the title at Bash at the Beach 1995. Sting was on the first-ever Monday Nitro in a match where Flair defeated Sting by disqualification as a result of a run-in by Arn Anderson to attack Flair. At Fall Brawl, Sting teamed with Hogan, Luger, and Randy Savage to defeat the Dungeon of Doom, consisting of Kamala, Zodiac, Shark and Meng, in the event's WarGames match. In October 1995, Flair convinced Sting to team with him in a match against Anderson and Brian Pillman at Halloween Havoc. Anderson and Pillman had attacked Flair earlier in the night, rendering Flair unable to come out for the first part of the match. Sting fended off his opponents until Flair emerged. Later in the match, Flair turned on Sting and reformed the Four Horsemen with Anderson and Pillman, later adding Chris Benoit to fill out the group. Sting defeated Flair on a subsequent Nitro with the Scorpion Deathlock, refusing to let go until Luger persuaded him to do so. Sting defeated Flair again at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Later in the night, Sting competed in the World War 3 battle royal for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Savage. Sting's alliances with Hogan and Savage led the Horsemen to attack them as well. Sting's second U.S. title reign lasted until November 13, when he was defeated by Kensuke Sasaki in Japan. At Starrcade, Sting defeated Sasaki, representing New Japan Pro Wrestling, in a non-title match to win the World Cup of Wrestling for WCW. In the next match that night, Sting lost a Triangle match involving Flair and Luger; Flair won by count-out to become number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair won from Savage in the next match. = Feud with the New World Order (1996‚Äì1998) = New World Order which included Kevin Nash (left). Early in 1996, Sting's appearance started to change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing his blond flattop haircut, and he often wore black tights with a multi-colored scorpion, although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful face paint. Sting teamed with his old friend Luger, who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the January 22 edition of Nitro. The team often retained the championship as a result of Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for WCW Uncensored in March, Harlem Heat member Booker T teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against The Giant at Slamboree in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of Nitro. In the summer of 1996, Sting was the first to stand up to The Outsiders: Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, who had recently competed in the WWF and whose alliances and agenda were unclear, had been infiltrating and causing chaos at WCW events. Sting teamed with Luger and Savage to defend WCW against Hall, Nash, and a mysterious third Outsider to be revealed at the Bash at the Beach. Hall and Nash started the bout without their third partner, but the WCW's temporary three-on-two advantage was short-lived: Luger left the match after he was accidentally injured by a mistimed Stinger Splash. The two- on-two match continued while Hogan, who had been a face character for nearly fifteen years, emerged at ringside. Hogan appeared ready to back up the WCW wrestlers until he attacked Savage with his leg drop finisher in one of wrestling's most famous swerves. The match was ruled a no-contest, and Hall, Nash, and Hogan declared a new world order in professional wrestling. The name stuck and Sting became one of WCW's stalwarts against the New World Order, or nWo for short. As part of this, Sting and Luger went up to rivals and Four Horsemen members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson some time after Bash at the Beach and asked them to team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their differences for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the Nitro prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by Jeff Farmer, attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of Nitro and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, \\"Is that good enough for you right there? Is that proof enough?\\" Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture and walked out of the match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on Nitro, Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: Declaring he would visit \\"from time to time\\", Sting threw the microphone down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, to take part in the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of Nitro, Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a \\"cheap imitation,\\" before telling the nWo, \\"the real Sting may or may not be in your price range,\\" and then concluded by saying \\"the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure\\". With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film The Crow. In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from The Crow. Sting maintains aspects of his \\"Crow\\" persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint. In a series of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was provoked enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon back as if he were going to assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a \\"blackballed\\" Randy Savage returned to WCW for the first time since Halloween Havoc and aligned himself with Sting as a \\"free agent\\" as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks, the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at SuperBrawl VII in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch Roddy Piper face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple of weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at WCW Uncensored in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, Chicago Bulls NBA star Dennis Rodman, Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical zip-line. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW. In subsequent weeks, Sting frequently rappelled from the rafters or came up through the ring to attack unsuspecting nWo members, came to the aid of wrestlers once subjected to his loyalty test as they battled the nWo, and employed decoy \\"Stings\\" to play mind games with the nWo during the closing segments of Nitro. Sting's appearances to fight the nWo at the end of almost every Nitro helped WCW keep and widen its television ratings advantage over the WWF's Monday Night Raw throughout the summer. On-screen WCW commissioner James J. Dillon tried many times to get Sting to return to wrestling by making contracts to fight various nWo members. Sting, however, did not accept any of the contracts, often tearing them up in Dillon's face. A confused Dillon then asked Sting who he wanted on one edition of Nitro, and Sting went out to ringside, picked up a fan's sign, and pointed out one name on it: Hogan. Eventually, Sting got his wish and he and Hogan finally met in December at Starrcade for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The finish of the match was supposed to echo the Montreal Screwjob finish that the WWF had used to double-cross Bret Hart just one month earlier at their annual Survivor Series event. Nick Patrick, the referee for the contest, was supposed to execute a fast count on Sting while Hart, whose signing with WCW was the linchpin for the Montreal Screwjob, would come out to protest the decision and, since he had already served as the guest referee for the match between Larry Zbyszko and Eric Bischoff earlier that evening, order the match to be restarted and Sting would emerge victorious by forcing Hogan to submit to the Scorpion Death Lock. However, Patrick did not do his part properly and instead counted the pin at normal speed, which added an unintentional level of controversy to the finish. The next night on Nitro, Hogan protested the decision claiming that Patrick's decision should have been considered final and a rematch was granted. The match ran over Nitro's allotted time slot and the finish was aired later in the week on the inaugural episode of Thunder. Similar to the Starrcade result, two different referees declared the two different men as the winner. Later that night, Dillon vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, forcing Sting to surrender the belt. Sting responded with his first words (on mic) since October 1996 when he told Dillon, \\"You've got no guts!\\" Sting turned to Hogan and said, \\"And you... You're a dead man!\\". = The Wolfpac (1998‚Äì1999) = Borden after a taping of Nitro in 1998 As 1998 began, the nWo began to splinter. Sting recaptured the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship in February at SuperBrawl VIII with the help of Savage, who was beginning to split from the nWo. Sting went on to successfully defend the title against the likes of Hall, Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). Like Savage, Nash began to pull away from the Hogan-dominated nWo, and Nash helped Savage beat Sting for the championship at Spring Stampede in April. Nash and Savage officially split from the original nWo on May 4, forming the face group nWo Wolfpac, while Hogan's heel faction became identified as nWo Hollywood. The two nWo factions vied for Sting's allegiance, with Sting's friends The Giant joining nWo Hollywood and Luger joining nWo Wolfpac. Sting seemed to have joined nWo Hollywood when he appeared wearing a black and white nWo shirt, but he soon tore off the shirt to reveal the red and black of the nWo Wolfpac. Sting began wearing red and black face paint and tights as a member of nWo Wolfpac. Sting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May when Hall turned on his teammate Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and the team was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at The Great American Bash in June to take control of the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and Konnan feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 Nitro. Sting and Hart squared off at Halloween Havoc, where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for several months. Sting returned to Nitro in March 1999, sporting the black and white Crow-inspired attire he debuted in 1996 and began to participate in more mic work. By this time, the nWo storyline had faded, and Sting was not aligned with any of its factions. Sting competed in the main event of April's Spring Stampede, a Four Corners match for the World Championship, against Hogan, DDP, and champion Flair. Savage served as special guest referee and delivered a diving elbow drop to help DDP win the match and the title. = Final world title reigns (1999‚Äì2000) = Sting defeated Page on the April 26 edition of Nitro to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the fifth time. Later that night, Sting defended the title in a four-way match featuring DDP, Goldberg, and a returning Nash. DDP pinned Nash, allowing DDP to win the title without directly beating Sting. Sting's 90-minute reign was only the second shortest WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign in WCW history. Sting lost to Rick Steiner in a Falls Count Anywhere match at The Great American Bash after he was attacked by Steiner's three pet dogs backstage and Steiner forced the referee to prematurely declare himself the victor, claiming his dogs had pinned Sting for him. Over the next several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, Vicious, and Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the Bash at the Beach in July to take on Vicious and Savage of Team Madness. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan returned from injury on July 12 as a face to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of Nitro to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, Vicious and Rick Steiner for the next month. Sting began to question Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in the weeks leading up to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official. Sting entered the 32-man tournament that was set up to award the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Brian Knobs, Meng, and Luger to reach the semi-finals to be held at WCW Mayhem. At the November event, Sting lost to Hart, the eventual winner of the tournament. After the match, Sting shook hands with Hart in a sign of respect, turning face again. Sting sought revenge against Luger the next month at Starrcade. Sting won by disqualification when Luger and Miss Elizabeth assaulted Sting with a steel chair and baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for some time. Sting ended his feud with Luger by defeating him in a Lumberjacks with Casts match at Uncensored the following March. = Last feuds and contract expiration (2000‚Äì2002) = WCW officials Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff, in an attempt to save the fading company, rebooted the storylines on April 10, 2000, and declared all titles vacant. At Spring Stampede the following week, Sting advanced to the finals of the United States Championship tournament by defeating Booker T and Vampiro in the first two rounds. Vampiro cost Sting the championship in the finals against Scott Steiner, leading to an intense feud between Sting and Vampiro. Sting pinned Vampiro at Slamboree in May, and Vampiro beat Sting in a Human Torch match at The Great American Bash the next month; for the climax of the match, Borden switched with a stuntman, who was set on fire and thrown off the top of the frame of the stage's entrance video screen. At Bash at the Beach, he returned wearing another Sting mask as men wearing cloaks and Sting masks carried him in a casket, and then he attacked Vampiro. Sting went on to feud with Jeff Jarrett and then Scott Steiner. Steiner attacked and injured Sting in November 2000. Sting stayed off WCW programming until the final episode of Nitro on March 26, 2001. WCW had been purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and the final match in WCW history pitted Sting against his longtime rival Flair; the two had also competed on the very first edition of Nitro on September 4, 1995. Sting defeated Flair and the two embraced at the end of the contest. After the WWF did not buy out Sting's contract with AOL Time Warner, he rejected a buyout offer of 50 cents on the dollar from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002 (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year). Borden then entered into contract negotiations with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.  World Wrestling All-Stars (2002‚Äì2003)  In 2002, after over a year and a half of hiatus, Borden toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion throughout November and December. His first match in the WWA took place on November 28, 2002, in Dublin, Ireland, where he reunited with Lex Luger to defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At The Retribution on December 6, 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, Sting lost to Luger in a bout for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Luger to claim the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in Zurich, Switzerland, on December 13. Sting embarked on a second tour with WWA in May 2003, successfully defending his championship against Rick Steiner, Shane Douglas, and Disco Inferno. The WWA held its final show, The Reckoning, on May 25 in Auckland, New Zealand, where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship, unifying the two championships.  Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003 - 2014) = Sporadic appearances (2003‚Äì2004) = In 2003, Sting signed a contract committing him to four appearances with the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. He debuted in TNA on the June 18 one year anniversary show, teaming with Jeff Jarrett to defeat A.J. Styles and Syxx Pac. Following this, Borden engaged in a comprehensive series of sitdown interviews with Mike Tenay, discussing his career and his faith. Sting returned to TNA on November 5, 2003, defeating Jarrett by disqualification in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On November 12, Sting teamed with A.J. Styles to defeat Jarrett and Lex Luger. He made his final TNA appearance of 2003 on December 17, defeating Jarrett in a non-title match. On March 24, 2004, Borden was interviewed once again by Mike Tenay as part of the promotion for his direct- to-video biographical film, Sting: Moment of Truth, and on March 31, he returned to the company for one night only as the special guest enforcer for the main-event, a four-way match between Abyss, A.J. Styles, Raven, and Ron Killings, which Raven won. = Feud with Jeff Jarrett (2005‚Äì2006) = On December 11, 2005, at Turning Point, as Jeff Jarrett stood in the ring celebrating his victory, the lights in the arena went out as images of a scorpion‚ÄîSting's symbol‚Äî appeared on the arena screens, along with the date \\"January 15, 2006\\". Spotlights then illuminated the ring, revealing a chair bearing Sting's signature trench coat, boots, and a black baseball bat in the center of the ring. His return to TNA was officially announced one minute after midnight on the January 1, 2006 episode of Impact!. On January 15 at Final Resolution, Sting and Christian Cage defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown in a tag team match after Sting pinned Jarrett. On the January 28, 2006 episode of Impact!, Sting made his Spike TV debut and first appearance on national television in almost five years, announcing his retirement. With Sting gone, the storyline continued with Jeff Jarrett and Eric Young worrying that Sting had not actually retired and sending Alex Shelley to California to videotape Sting at home. Sting discovered Shelley filming, then walked up to Shelley's car and told him that he was going to show up at Destination X and confront Jeff Jarrett as Steve Borden. Clad in \\"street clothes\\" and without face paint Borden returned on March 12 at Destination X, saving Christian Cage and Rhino as they were attacked by Jarrett's Army. He placed Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock, but was attacked by the debuting Scott Steiner shortly thereafter. This led to a Lethal Lockdown match between Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino against Jarrett's Army. On April 23 at Lockdown, Sting's team won the match. Following Lockdown, Sting proceeded to seek out partners to help him defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner for good. After bringing out Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Rick Steiner as options, he settled on Samoa Joe. On May 14 at Sacrifice, Sting and Joe defeated Jarrett and Steiner after Joe pinned Jarrett with a Muscle Buster. Still having proven unsuccessful at putting Jarrett away, Sting defeated Scott Steiner by disqualification to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 18. Due to a confrontation with Christian Cage during the match, Sting was distracted, which allowed crooked referee Earl Hebner to knock over the ladder both were on, sending both men to the floor and allow Jarrett to pick up the victory. On July 16 at Victory Road, Sting won a four-way to win a title shot for Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Sting received his title shot on August 13 at Hard Justice, but failed to capture the title after Christian Cage turned heel and hit Sting with Jarrett's guitar. He would have another match at Bound for Glory, where Sting put his career on the line. He went on to claim his second NWA World Heavyweight title when he made Jarrett submit to the Scorpion Deathlock marking the first major championship title Sting had won since 1999. With that victory, Sting became the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era, as well as the only person to ever win the title both before and after the inception of TNA. This would also go on to make Sting the longest superstar to recapture his second NWA title from 1990 to 2006 (16 years). Sting lost the title to Abyss on November 19 at Genesis by disqualification after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into a stack of tables covered in barbed wire. In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued and Christian Cage was involved, facing the three of them in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10 at Turning Point, where Abyss retained the title. = TNA World Heavyweight Champion (2007‚Äì2008) = Lockdown in 2007 As 2007 came along, Sting continued his feud with Abyss while trying to recapture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, facing him at Final Resolution, Against All Odds and Destination X in a Last Rites match, but he never claimed the title. Also, Abyss and Sting were placed in different team in the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. Sting, with the help of Jeff Jarrett, pinned Abyss to win the match for his team and end their bitter rivalry. At Sacrifice, a match between Sting, Kurt Angle and NWA World Champion Christian Cage was booked. The day of the PPV, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team title. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA Title at NWA live events. At the event, Cage, still holding the physical NWA Championship belt, defended what was billed as the \\"World Heavyweight Championship\\" against Sting and Angle. Angle was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit, and was announced as the new \\"TNA World Heavyweight Champion\\". The Impact! following the event, the title was labelled as the \\"TNA World Heavyweight Championship\\", but the title was vacated. A tournament was then held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. Sting lost his qualifying match with Samoa Joe after Christopher Daniels interfered. Sting instead faced Daniels on June 17 at Slammiversary, which he ultimately won. After his feud with Daniels, Sting began teaming up with his former enemy, Abyss who had recently turned face. Together, the two went on to defeat A.J. Styles and Tomko on July 15 at Victory Road. While trying to help Abyss to win a match against A.J. Styles, Sting and Abyss were attacked by Christian's Coalition. Abyss was pulled under the ring and Sting was slammed into broken glass by Tomko, before Abyss emerged bleeding badly and was slammed into the broken glass and thumbtacks. The following week, Sting and Abyss got revenge by defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles in a ladder match, in the process earning a contract that allowed them to pick the type of match between Abyss and Christian at Hard Justice. Sting's team won in a \\"Doomsday Chamber of Blood\\" match, with Abyss pinning A.J. Styles to become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. After that, Sting started a feud with the TNA World Champion Kurt Angle. First, Sting defeated A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Samoa Joe in a four-way match to become the co-holder of the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Angle, but lost it 30 days later against Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones and Ron Killings at No Surrender. Sting would face Angle for the World title at Bound for Glory, where Sting won his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. However, he would lost the title back to Angle two days later on Impact! after Kevin Nash interfered on Angle's behalf. Sting would face Angle and Nash at Genesis, with the debutant Booker T as his mystery partner. In the match, whoever scored the pinfall would win the TNA World Championship, which Angle won after pinning Sting to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This would be the final TNA appearance of Sting in 2007 as he would take some time off to be with his family. Sting then made his official return on March 27. At Lockdown, he teamed with Team Cage (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Matt Morgan) and defeated Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). After the tag titles were vacated, Jim Cornette held a Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament to determine new champs. Four teams were already in the Sacrifice finals, while Cornette named eight wrestlers as the \\"Egotistical 8\\". Sting's partner was James Storm and on May 11 at Sacrifice, they came up short due their inability get along, and towards the end, Sting attacked Storm and walked out. Sting was not seen after that except in an interview which talked about his career and his eventual retirement. Sting at Bound for Glory IV On July 13 at Victory Road, Booker T faced Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Sting tried to talk sense into Joe, as he was brutally beating Booker T, and was potentially heading towards a disqualification. Joe rebuked him, and Sting struck him with his trademark black baseball bat. Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as Impact! went off the air, leading to a question of whether Sting had turned on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a face reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a Last Man Standing match. = The Main Event Mafia (2008‚Äì2009) = Sting with The Main Event Mafia On October 12 at Bound for Glory IV, Sting challenged Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and was successful in claiming the title, after Kevin Nash returned and hit Joe with Sting's baseball bat. After the PPV, Sting with Kurt Angle, Booker T, Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner created The Main Event Mafia, a stable formed by veterans and former World Champions and feuded with younger wrestlers, called TNA Frontline. Sting defended the title against Frontline's AJ Styles at Turning Point and Rhino on January 11 at Genesis. Sting also feuded with the leader of The Main Event Mafia Kurt Angle. At Against All Odds, Sting defended the title angainst Angle, Brother Ray and Brother Devon and against Angle in a singles match at Destination X. At Lockdown, Sting lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mick Foley inside the Six Sides of Steel, ending his reign at 189 days (his longest world title reign for any organization). On May 24 at Sacrifice, Sting defeated Kurt Angle to become the new Godfather of the Main Event Mafia. On June 21 at Slammiversary, Sting defeated Matt Morgan in a singles match, thus preventing Morgan from joining the Main Event Mafia. On the following episode of Impact!, Sting's fellow Main Event Mafia members attacked him, removed him from the group, and Kurt Angle reclaimed his role as Godfather. The following week, Sting took his revenge upon the Mafia, when he attacked every member of the group and stole Angle's world heavyweight championship belt, becoming a fully fledged face as a result. On July 19 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by new Main Event Mafia member Samoa Joe in a singles match after the debuting Taz interfered on Joe's behalf. On August 16 at Hard Justice, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match, which also included Matt Morgan. On September 20 at No Surrender, Sting lost a five-way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship that also included A.J. Styles, Hernandez, Kurt Angle, and Matt Morgan. Instead of pinning Angle, he opted to attack Morgan, to allow Styles to pin Angle and become the new World Heavyweight Champion. As a token of gratitude, Styles offered to give him a title shot at the following month's PPV Bound for Glory in a match billed as possibly being Sting's retirement match. At the PPV, Styles defeated Sting to retain his title, ending Sting's undefeated streak at Bound for Glory. After the match he announced that he didn't know whether he would continue his career or not, Saying that \\"the way you fans are reacting right now, makes me wanna stay forever!\\" At the end of the year the match was voted the match of the year by the fans of TNA. = Feud with Immortal (2010‚Äì2011) = Sting with red face paint in July 2010 On the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night edition of Impact! Sting returned to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, attacking Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. During th following months, Sting would join other heel wrestlers against face wrestlers like Van Dam, Jarrett or Hogan. At Lockdown, Team Flair (formed by Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). After defeating Jeff Jarrett at Sacrifice, Sting faced Rob Van Dam for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. However, during the match Jarrett made his return and cost Sting the title. After assaulting Jarrett from behind on the June 24 edition of Impact!, TNA president Dixie Carter (storyline) suspended Sting for 30 days. When he returned, Sting changed his gimmick, wearing his nWo Wolfpac red face paint, and was paired with Kevin Nash. They would start a feud with Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe, facing them No Surrender and Bound for Glory, where Sting, Nash and D'Angelo Dinero defeated Jarrett and Joe after Jarrett turned heel by leaving the ring and having Joe wrestle alone. At the end of Bound for Glory, it was revealed that Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they turned heel with Jarrett and Jeff Hardy as Abyss's \\"they\\", and in the process turned Sting, Nash and Dinero back to being faces. On the following edition of Impact!, Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan, Bischoff and their new group, Immortal. After the promo, they walked out on TNA, but Nash left the promotion for real. Borden took a hiatus from TNA television as his contract had expired at the end of 2010. Mr. Anderson in the crowd at Slammiversary IX He returned on February 24, 2011 at the tapings of the March 3 edition of Impact!, where he appeared as a surprise challenger and defeated Immortal's Jeff Hardy to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the third time. On March 13 at Victory Road, Sting successfully defended the title against Hardy in a No Disqualification rematch that lasted ninety seconds. According to word from backstage, the match was planned to last longer, but it was cut short after Hardy was deemed too intoxicated to wrestle. Sting was later heard agreeing with a fan's claim that the match was \\"bullshit\\". The following month at Lockdown, Sting successfully defended the title against Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam in a three-way steel cage match, Van Dam at Sacrifice, and Anderson at Slammiversary IX, where he lost the title following outside interference from Eric Bischoff. Over the next few weeks, Sting displayed a more maniacal character similar in look and style to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker from the 2008 film The Dark Knight. On the July 14 edition of Impact Wrestling, Sting, now dubbed as the \\"Insane Icon\\", regained the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Mr. Anderson, after Fortune and Kurt Angle, disguised as his clown minions, attacked each member of Immortal, preventing them from interfering in the match. He would go on to lose the title to Kurt Angle on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, after Angle hit him with a chair brought to the ring by Hulk Hogan. Sting continued tormenting head members of Immortal with his strange new personality, and on the August 18 edition of Impact Wrestling, his longtime rival Ric Flair made his return to TNA and challenged him to a match. Sting agreed to put his career on the line in the match in exchange for Flair promising to deliver him his long-awaited match with Hogan, should he be able to defeat him. On the September 1 edition of Impact Wrestling, Sting received a rematch against Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from special enforcer Hulk Hogan and the rest of Immortal. On September 11 at No Surrender, Hogan once again cost Sting the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a three-way match, which also included Mr. Anderson. On the September 15 edition of Impact Wrestling, Sting defeated longtime rival Ric Flair to earn the right to face Hogan at Bound for Glory. On the October 6 edition of Impact Wrestling, after being exposed for his false claim of retiring and his secret ridicule of the fans, a furious Hogan impulsively agreed to hand TNA back to Dixie Carter, should Sting manage to defeat him at Bound for Glory. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Sting defeated Hogan to bring Dixie Carter back to power. After the match, Hogan turned on Immortal and helped Sting overcome the odds in his battle with the stable. On the following edition of Impact Wrestling, Carter placed Sting in charge of the program. Sting returned to the ring on the December 22 and February 9, 2012, editions of Impact Wrestling, where he teamed up with Jeff Hardy to defeat TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode and Bully Ray both times. = Final feuds and departure (2012‚Äì2014) = During the first months of 2012, Sting feuded with the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode. He was defeated by Roode at Victory Road in a non-title No Holds Barred match, and at Slammiversary in a title match. During this time, he also left the General Manager position in favor of Hulk Hogan, signed a new contract extension with TNA and was announced as the first inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame. Sting in January 2013 His next feud was against a newly formed masked faction called \\"Aces & Eights\\", where he was pointed as the interim general manager after Hogan hiatus due to a back injury. The feud led to a match at Bound for Glory alongside with Bully Ray, where they were defeated by the Aces & Eights, following interference from a man who was afterwards unmasked as Ray's longtime partner, the returning Devon. As a result of their win, the Aces & Eights earned full access to TNA. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting defeated Devon via disqualification, following interference from the Aces & Eights. On the November 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting was sidelined with a storyline injury, after being put through a table and beaten with a ball-peen hammer by DOC, a member of Aces & Eights. Sting returned on the January 3, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling, saving Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe from Aces & Eights before beating the group down with a baseball bat. Sting wrestled his return match the following week, defeating Aces & Eights member Mike Knox after he injured Kurt Angle. Three days later at Genesis, Sting gained his revenge on DOC by defeating him in a singles match. On the February 7 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting teamed up with Bully Ray to defeat Devon and DOC in a Tables match. On March 10 at Lockdown, Team TNA, consisting of Sting, Eric Young, James Storm, Magnus, and Samoa Joe defeated Aces & Eights, consisting of Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, Mike Knox, and Mr. Anderson in a Lethal Lockdown match. After Bully Ray won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and revealed himself as the president of Aces & Eights later that night, Hulk Hogan blamed Sting as he had encouraged Hogan to give Ray the title shot while also encouraging Hogan to support Ray's marriage with his daughter Brooke. Sting proceeded to walk out on Hogan. Sting returned on the April 25 Impact Wrestling, saving Hogan from an attack by the Aces & Eights. The following week, Sting reconciled with Hogan and became the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship later that night after defeating Matt Morgan. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Bully Ray for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a No Holds Barred Match after an interference by Aces & Eights. Per stipulation, Sting would never get another title opportunity again. On the June 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting noted that nobody in the back helped him during his title match, but he would form a New Main Event Mafia to battle the Aces & Eights. In the following weeks, Sting would recruit Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Magnus, and Rampage Jackson as members of the New Main Event Mafia. Before Bound for Glory, MEM member Magnus complained to Sting because his losses. Magnus told to Sting he had Flair to put him in the map, but he had nobody, so Sting challenged him to a match at Bound for Glory. At Bound for Glory, Sting was defeated by Magnus. On the October 31 episode of Impact Wrestling, Dixie Carter offered to lift the lifetime ban so Sting can get another World title opportunity again by entering him first in a Battle Royal Gauntlet match, which was won by Magnus as Sting attempted to eliminate Kazarian, and Magnus eliminated the both of them. Sting disbanded The Main Event Mafia after Aces & Eights disbanded, and while other members began to chase their TNA World Heavyweight Championship dreams, Sting started a feud against Ethan Carter III and Dixie Carter after they began humiliating TNA Legends, like Curry Man and Earl Hebner by Carter. On the December 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, Carter was confronted by Sting, and was issued an option, either face Sting immediately, or enter the Feast or Fired match. Carter entered the Feast or Fired match, and grabbed one of the briefcases. On the December 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, the Feast or Fired briefcase revealed to contain a future TNA World Tag Team Championship match, and also led to the firing of Chavo Guerrero. On the January 16, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling: Genesis, Sting lost a match to Ethan Carter III due an interference from the TNA World Heavyweight Champion Magnus and subsequently challenged Magnus to a Title vs. Career match for the January 23 episode of Impact Wrestling: Genesis, which Sting lost, and his TNA contract was terminated as a result.  WWE (2014 - 2020) = Pre-debut appearances (2014) = Veteran professional wrestling journalist Bill Apter chronicled Sting's career in a piece for WWE.com on February 19, 2014, wherein he stated that Sting's \\"best days may still be yet to come\\". He appeared in a WWE Network production on April 15, 2014, sharing a story of his former tag team partner The Ultimate Warrior, who had recently died. This marked Sting's first non-archive appearance on a WWE-branded show. Sting was a prominent contributor to the documentary film Warrior: The Ultimate Legend, which aired on the WWE Network on April 17. The following day, online retailer Zavvi announced the WWE Home Video DVD and Blu-ray The Best of Sting, which was released on September 23, 2014. On July 14, Sting appeared in a vignette on Raw to promote the video game WWE 2K15, in which he was featured as a pre-order bonus character in both his 'Crow' and 'Surfer' (pre-1996) incarnations. That same day, WWE began selling official Sting merchandise. On July 24, Borden made his first public appearance for WWE, in full Sting garb, as a surprise guest at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International. The event was held to announce WWE's upcoming line of Mattel action figures, in which the company's first ever Sting figure would appear. Prior to that appearance, Sting gave his first interview with WWE.com, which was released later that day. On August 4, WWE announced Sting as a guest on the WWE 2K15 \\"Roster Reveal\\" panel, which took place on August 16 in Los Angeles. = Feud with The Authority (2014‚Äì2015) = On November 23, during the main event of Survivor Series, Sting made his first-ever appearance in a WWE ring by attacking Triple H with a Scorpion Death Drop and also costing Team Authority the match. On January 19, 2015, Sting made his live Raw debut by appearing backstage during the main event, then walking to the stage, causing a distraction and costing Authority members Big Show, Kane and Seth Rollins their handicap match against John Cena; this win gave the recently fired Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan their jobs back. Triple H challenged Sting to a face-to-face confrontation on the January 26 episode of Raw. Sting accepted this challenge on the February 16 episode of Raw by sending a Sting doppelganger into the ring to scare Triple H, after airing a vignette on the big screen accepting Triple H's challenge. Sting and Triple H had a confrontation at Fastlane on February 22. Following physicality between the two, Sting pointed to the WrestleMania 31 sign with his baseball bat, issuing a challenge for the event that was accepted by Triple H. On the March 16 episode of Raw, Sting made a surprise appearance and helped Randy Orton fight off the Authority. Immediately following on the WWE Network, Sting spoke for the first time in-ring.

That same night, a second match was booked with John Cena and Sting defeating Show and Rollins. At Night of Champions, Sting was defeated by Rollins and suffered a legit neck injury after a turnbuckle powerbomb. = Hall of Fame and retirement (2016‚Äì2020) = It was announced on the January 11, 2016 episode of Raw that Sting would be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2016. Sting ultimately reneged on having surgery; on March 22, 2016 he explained that he felt \\"completely normal\\" and had none of the side effects associated with cervical spinal stenosis. On April 2, during his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech, Sting announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He appeared at WrestleMania 32, alongside his fellow 2016 inductees, the following night. In August 2016, Sting appeared on the WWE Network show Legends with JBL and talked about his career. He also stated that he has still not undergone surgery, which would definitively end his career, and he still holds hope for a match with The Undertaker, claiming that such a match is his \\"unfinished business\\" in wrestling. However, the match never happened as both their careers wound down. On the February 25, 2019 episode of Raw, Sting made his first appearance on WWE television since 2016, at the 70th birthday celebration of Ric Flair but Flair was attacked by Batista before he could make it to the ring. In May 2020, it was reported that Sting was no longer under WWE contract.  Legacy and influence  Sting's induction into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016 Sting is widely regarded as the greatest performer in WCW history. Former rival Hulk Hogan asserted that Sting should be mentioned in any conversation regarding the top 10 greatest pro wrestlers of all time; numerous outlets have placed him in such listings. Sting also garnered one of the largest and most loyal fanbases in the industry; he was voted by Pro Wrestling Illustrated readers as \\"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\\" four times (a record shared with John Cena), for the years 1991, 1992, 1994 and 1997. Digital Spy writer Mayer Nissim commended Sting's ability to constantly evolve his gimmick while fellow franchise players Hulk Hogan and John Cena largely failed to do so, in order to maintain spectator interest. Borden is known for his charity work, once regarding his involvement with the Make-A-Wish and Starlight Children's Foundations as his \\"most fulfilling activity\\". His young supporters are known as the \\"Little Stingers\\". Prior to his signing with WWE, Sting's legacy was perpetuated by the organization. It hailed him as \\"one of sports-entertainment's elite\\", and ranked him at number one in listings of the greatest wrestlers to never perform in WWE,The 10 Greatest Wrestlers to Never Wrestle in WWE.

In regard to Sting's creative handling after he signed with WWE, PWInsider editor Dave Scherer wrote that \\"he really represented WCW so he was never going to get that [legend] treatment\\". Sting was the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame. TNA president Dixie Carter credits Sting with being the major wrestling superstar that TNA needed to establish itself. The company describes him as having had an \\"unparalleled career\\" and as being a legend who surpasses time. Sting was regarded by colleagues in WCW as a professional and well-respected locker room leader. Prominent adversary Big Van Vader felt that Sting had unsurpassed athletic prowess within the business, and \\"ranks right up at the top\\" as an in-ring performer. Ric Flair called Sting his greatest opponent. Former rival Diamond Dallas Page, commenting on Sting's entry into WWE in 2014, said: \\"Everyone there grew up watching him... No one did it better than Sting, nobody\\". John Cena mimicked Sting's hairstyle in his younger years and recalled, \\"he was my guy\\";Greatest Stars of the 90s. WWE Home Video. 2009. John Cena: \\"To see Sting win that match [vs. Ric Flair at The Great American Bash (1990)], obviously, as a kid I was going nuts: he was my guy.\\" Jeff Hardy: We went to see WCW in Fayetteville. There was this one moment, man, a changing moment in my life, when I reached out and I touched Sting... I was like, 'Wow, I wanna be that guy'.\\" Seth Rollins would dress up as Sting in his youth. Tommy Dreamer told how he \\"wanted to be Sting\\"‚Äîa sentiment shared by Jeff Hardy. Cody Rhodes and Shelton Benjamin named him their favorite childhood wrestler, while Tyson Kidd professed to being \\"a huge Sting fan as a kid\\".Sting: Into the Light. WWE Home Video. 2015. Bill Goldberg: \\"I looked up to [Sting].\\" Tyson Kidd: \\"I was a huge Sting fan as a kid.\\" He was also a prominent influence on industry veterans Kurt Angle, Bill Goldberg, Kane, A.J. Styles and Goldust. Bray Wyatt has stressed that he \\"really would like to take on\\" Sting, adding: \\"I have to have [that] before I die; I don't care if it happens outside a Waffle House, somewhere.\\" Drawing ability Sting's drawing ability has been disputed. Journalist Dave Scherer of PWInsider wrote: \\"Sting is an all timer for sure, but the fact is that when he was the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge\\". Pro wrestling historian Dave Meltzer also reported that Sting was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of Power Slam felt that while Sting did not make \\"essential improvements\\" nor \\"grow into the champion's role\\" during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. On the other hand, Steve Austin has taken exception to the notion that Sting was not a profitable wrestler. Reflecting on Sting in the early 1990s, veteran wrestler Kevin Nash said: \\"There weren't many draws in WCW at that point, but he was one of them\\". Former WCW booker Mike Graham asserted that Sting was a television ratings success during the Monday Night Wars, while fellow booker Kevin Sullivan said of Sting's rivalry with Ric Flair: \\"If I needed to draw a rating, Sting and Flair always drew. It was like [Muhammad] Ali and [Joe] Frazier\\". The Clash of the Champions I event in 1988, which aired opposite the WWF's WrestleMania IV and was headlined by Sting vs. Flair, generated a record-setting 5.6 rating on TBS. The pair also main-evented The Great American Bash 1990, which was the NWA's biggest pay-per-view success up to that point. Sting was a major attraction in 1997, being WCW's top merchandise seller (second only to the WWF's Steve Austin overall)Molinaro, John F. The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time (Wrestling Observer). Winding Stair Press. 2002. Page 197. . and, versus Hollywood Hogan, headlining the biggest-grossing pay-per-view event in the company's history at Starrcade 1997. Sting went on to join the nWo Wolfpac stable, which dominated WCW's merchandise sales at events in mid 1998. Discussing Sting in WWE, Kevin Nash said that he is \\"so valuable to the company as a trademark\\".  Resistance to signing with WWE  Prior to his signing with WWE, Sting was widely considered the greatest wrestler never to perform for the company. He had \\"really good conversations\\" with the promotion during his career, but did not appear there until 2014, at the age of 55. His loyalty to WCW, even in its dying days, has been noted. That organization was purchased by the WWF (now WWE) in 2001, and Sting's contract with its parent company AOL Time Warner expired in 2002, but he still refused to make the jump, alternately attributing this to the WWF's creative usage of former WCW talents and negative dealings with their attorneys. The company's onerous live schedule and the content of its programming were also factors. Sting has, however, downplayed rumors of a difficult relationship with WWE. Rather than sign with the WWF in 2002, Sting performed for smaller promotions, becoming the centerpiece of TNA by the mid 2000s. His pre-WWE career included \\"dream\\" matches against former WWF stars Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart in WCW, as well as bouts opposite names such as Ric Flair, Randy Savage, Kurt Angle and Mick Foley. Sting often wrestled Steve Austin in WCW; he had positive negotiations with WWE in 2003, with his proposed debut angle being a confrontation with Austin at the conclusion of WrestleMania XIX. He was also \\"very, very close\\" to making a deal with the company in 2011, which would potentially have involved a match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVII. Although Sting wrestled Mark Calaway in his pre-Undertaker character, \\"Mean\\" Mark Callous, at an untelevised WCW live event in 1990, WWE viewers clamored for a televised Sting vs. Undertaker match.  Other media  Borden appeared in the music video for the song \\"Fire in the Hole\\" by L»ß»ßz Rockit in 1989. He made his acting debut in the action-adventure show Super Force as an assassin. He starred in a pay-per-view only film titled The Real Reason (Men Commit Crimes) (1998). Borden was featured in a Sprite commercial in 1999. He also appeared in three episodes of the action-adventure series with Hulk Hogan in Thunder in Paradise as the character Adam \\"Hammerhead\\" McCall. Borden made a guest appearance on Walker, Texas Ranger as biker and drug dealer Grangus in the episode \\"Unsafe Speed\\". He also appeared in Ready to Rumble (2000) as Sting. He also appeared in the Christian film, The Encounter (2010) and was featured as the lead actor in the TV movie Shutterspeed (2000). He makes a cameo appearance as Sting on an episode of Upright Citizens Brigade. Borden played an outlaw biker in the film Revelation Road (2013). His book, Moment Of Truth, was released on December 1, 2004. In October 2015, WWE released a second Sting DVD titled Sting: Into the Light. The three-disc set features a behind-the- scenes documentary with Sting himself as he prepares to step into a WWE ring for the first time ever at WrestleMania 31.

Saliers plays lead guitar as well as banjo, piano, mandolin, ukulele, bouzouki and many other instruments. Early life and education Saliers was born in New Haven, Connecticut as the second eldest of four daughters‚Äîto Don and Jane Saliers (n√©e Firmin; a librarian). Since approximately age 11, she was raised in Decatur, Georgia (in metro Atlanta). Don Saliers was the William R. Cannon Distinguished Professor of Theology and Worship at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University; he is currently Theologian-in-Residence and a professor emeritus. In addition to teaching theology and worship, he directed the master of sacred music program there. Emily attended Laurel Ridge Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia. She later attended Shamrock High School, which she did not like. She began her college education at Tulane University but transferred to Emory University, graduating in 1985 with a bachelor's degree in English. Musical career Indigo Girls Saliers first met her future Indigo Girls counterpart Amy Ray when they were students at Laurel Ridge Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia. As students at Shamrock High School, they started performing music together at talent shows and local venues (including bars when she was still under age) under the band names of \\"Saliers & Ray\\" and the \\"B-Band\\". When Saliers (the elder of the duo) left Georgia for college in Louisiana, Ray frequently visited her. They would play together for tips in New Orleans' French Quarter. Saliers and Ray eventually reunited when they transferred from their respective colleges to Emory University. At Emory they settled upon the band name Indigo Girls; Ray came across the word indigo in the dictionary and \\"thought it sounded cool\\". Performing as Emily Saliers In 2004, Saliers composed her first film score for the independent short film, One Weekend a Month.One Weekend A Month at YouTube.com She occasionally performs solo at benefit shows or as a guest with friends' bands. She and her father Don Saliers performed together once at the Washington National Cathedral in 2007.

Icelandic accounts Source material N√≥r of Norway appear in ‚ÄúFundinn N√≥regr‚Äù (‚ÄòNorway Founded‚Äô), hereafter called F, which begins the Orkneyinga saga, and in Hversu Noregr bygg√∞ist (‚ÄòHow Norway was Settled‚Äô), hereafter called B, both found in the Flatey Book. The term is described differently in different sources.https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nor About Thorri King Thorri (√ûorri 'frozen snow') was son of Sn√¶r ('Snow') the Old, a descendant of Fornj√≥t (\\"king of Jotlandi (also spelled GotlandiSee second line: http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Fundinn_Noregr), later known as Quennlandi and Finnlandi\\"). See Sn√¶r and Fornj√≥t for further information. The name √ûorri has long been connected with that of √û√≥rr, the name of the Norse thunder god Thor, or thunder personified.Georg Friedrich Creuzer, Franz Joseph Mone, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten V√∂lker, besonders der Griechen, Heyer und Leske, 1822, p. 275. A grandson of King Snow, and Frost before that, king N√≥r marries Hedda (H√∂ddu) daughter of Sva√∞a J√≥tun that may be seen as descending from the Scyldings, from the Kings of Lejre, the stronghold of the descendants of Dan in Denmark. √ûorri is the sister of Driva, mother of Visbur, as attested by the scolding poetic genealogy known as Ynglingatal, by King Vanlande (from the land of the Wends), as well as F√≥nn and Mj√≥l, by their father Snow the Old (Sn√¶r ins Gamli) - who lived for 360 years. He was an offspring of Frost (Frosti), child of K√°ri (master of the arctic wind), sibling to Logi (master of the fire - eponymous to H√•logaland - High Logi), & Hler (master of the sea, called √Ügir, and cognate with Llyr as well as King Lear of Shakespeare, as well as eponymous to Lejre and L√¶s√∏). Chronicon Lethrens' The Chronicle of Lejre (‚ÄúChronicon Lethrense‚Äù) written about 1170 introduces a primeval King Ypper of Uppsala whose three sons were Dan who afterwards ruled Denmark, Nori who afterwards ruled Norway, and √ñsten who afterwards ruled the Swedes. But the account then speaks only of the descendants of Dan. Although not matching, there are some correspondences between the sources. In the B-source (Hversu Noregr bygg√∞ist) N√≥r is married H√∂ddu, granddaughter of a King √ñsten, on her mother √Öshild's side. Her and her brother Hrolf of Berg's father, Sva√∞a J√≥tun appears in a number of obscure genealogies as a descendant from Dan, through Hj√∂rvard Halgison, also named √Ösathor O√∞innson who married Helga Fri√∞leifsson; Fri√∞leif was born to Fr√≥√∞i King of Denmark, descendants of Scj√∂ldr, eponymous anchestor of the Scyldings. Both accounts state that great sacrifice was made yearly at mid-winter, whence was derived both the name of the mid-winter sacrifice and the name of the winter month Thorri corresponding to late January and early February in the Roman calendar. The story of N√≥r One year, at the time of Thorri's Sacrifice, G√≥i the daughter of King Thorri suddenly vanished. Thorri held a second feast the following month hoping to learn what had become of G√≥i. That sacrifice was afterward also observed regularly and known as G√≥i's Sacrifice and the name of the month was thence named G√≥i. When G√≥i was still not found after three years, her brothers N√≥r and G√≥r set out separately in search of her with many folk in their following, N√≥r and his folk going by land on skis while G√≥r went by ship and searched the islands and skerries. Eventually N√≥r and his following came to the Kj√∂len Mountains (the Keel) and passed into was later to be called Norway, defeating any who opposed him. F relates in particular that N√≥r defeated the folk around what was later called the Trondheimsfjord, that N√≥r also took possession of the eastern lands near Lake Mjors (modern lake Mj√∏sa), then slew King Sokni, the eponym of Sokna Dale (modern Sogndal) and Sognefj√∂rd (modern Sognefjorden) and took possession of his kingdom. But B mentions instead the defeat of four kings named V√©i, Vei, Hunding (Hundingr), and Heming (Hemingr). Then, in Heidemark (approximately the modern region of Hedemarken in the more extensive province of Hedmark), N√≥r met with King Hr√≥lf of the Hill (Hr√≥lfr √≠ Bergr). Hr√≥lf was son of the giant Svadi (Sva√∞i) from Dovre Mountain in the north. According to B Hr√≥lf's mother was √Åshild (√Åshildr) daughter of King Eystein of Heidemark. It was this Hr√≥lf who had taken G√≥i captive and had then made her his wife. N√≥r and Hr√≥lf came to terms (after a long single combat according to F). Hr√≥lf kept G√≥i as his wife and N√≥r afterwards married Hr√≥lf's sister (called H√∂dd in B) and became N√≥r's man. Both accounts relate that G√≥r eventually joined N√≥r and the two brothers made an agreement that N√≥r would rule all the mainland but G√≥r would rule all islands around the mainland, that he would be lord over any island that was separated from the mainland by a channel through which a ship with a fixed rudder was able to pass. The mainland was then named Norway (Noregr) after N√≥r. N√≥r's new kingdom is now said to have been what is south-eastern Norway today, as it extended from J√∂tunheim mountains in the north to what was later known as √Ålfheim (roughly the modern Swedish Bohusl√§n) in the south, the southern border of N√≥r's land being what is now the Glomma river whose southwestern course is not very far inside the southeastern border of modern Norway. The sons and grandsons and later descendants of N√≥r continually divided their inheritances among themselves so that Norway became filled with many small kingdoms and lordships. Descendants of N√≥r According to B, N√≥r's sons by H√∂dd were Thr√°nd (√ûr√°ndr) and Gard (Gar√∞r). B later brings in another son of N√≥r named Raum (Raumr). Presumably either Raum had another mother than H√∂dd or Raum's name has accidentally dropped out from the earlier listing of H√∂dd's sons. =Thr√°nd= Thr√°nd ruled Trondheim (√ûr√°ndheimr) which was named after him and refers approximately to present day county of S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag and the southern parts of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, rather than to the city now called Trondheim. Eireks saga v√≠√∞f√∂rla ('The Saga of Eirek the Traveller') also brings in Thrand as the first king to regin of Trondheim. Thrand's ancestry is not given here, but he is the father of Eirek the Traveller (Eirekr inn v√≠√∞f«´rli) the hero of the saga. H√°lfdanar saga Eysteinssonar ('Saga of Halfdan Eystein's son') states instead that Trondheim was named from King Thr√°nd, the father of Eirek the Traveller, but also states that Thrand was son of King S√¶mingr of H√°logaland, son of Odin, and that Thr√°nd's mother and S√¶mingr's wife was Nauma after whom Naumu Dale was named. For more on S√¶mingr see Sons of Odin. Thrand's wife is here said to be Dagm√¶r sister of Svanhv√≠t the wife of Hr√≥mund Grip's son, the protagonist of Hr√≥mundar saga Gripssonar. The saga says that Eystein, son of Thrand and Dagm√¶r, married √Åsa, a daughter of Sigurd Hart (the maternal grandfather of Harald Fairhair), and she bore him Halfdan, the hero of the saga. This places Thrand just three generations back from Harald Fairhair. But this saga seems to be a late and untraditional creation, dating only to the early 14th century. =Gard= Gard son of N√≥r was also called Gard Agdi (Gar√∞r Ag√∞i), apparently as ruler of Agdir (Ag√∞ir): the modern counties of Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder. Gard Agdi's descendants ruled the southwestern regions of Norway. See Gard Agdi for details. =Raum the Old= Raum inherited south-eastern Norway and also the northwestern valley of the Rauma river to the western sea which waters the region called Raums Dale (modern Romsdal). Raum in this account also ruled the land of √Ålfheim to the south. See Raum the Old for further details on Raum and his descendants. Descendants of G√≥r G√≥r had sons named Heiti and Beiti (and according to B two other sons named Meitir and Geitir). Heiti and Beiti often made war against the sons of N√≥r. Beiti the sea-king had one of his ships put on sledge runners and so passed in the ship over the snow-covered land starting from what was afterwards called Beitstad on Beitstadfjorden from Beiti's named and passing north across Ellid√¶id (Elli√∞√¶i√∞ 'Galley-neck') to Naumu Dale (Naumudal) with his father G√≥r in the ship with his hand on the tiller. So, by the agreement that had been made between N√≥r and G√≥r, the land between the path of the ship and the sea became Beiti's. The names of Beiti's descendants are missing from B. Heiti the sea-king was the father of Svadi (Sva√∞i). Geitir was father of Glammi and Gylfi; and Meitir the sea-king was father of two sons named M√¶vil and Myndil (Myndill), Myndil being father of two sons named Ekkil (Ekkill) and Skekkil (Skekkill). But F speaks only of G√≥r's son Heiti as the father of Sveidi (Svei√∞i) the father of Halfdan the Old, who confusingly is named identically to Halfdan the Old who is a descendant of N√≥r. But it is from Halfdan the Old who is called a descendant of G√≥r from whom springs at last the Jarls of Orkney who are the subject of the Orkneyinga saga. See Halfdan the Old to follow this lineage further.

Cuban-style mozambique Mozambique (pron.: mo.sam.'Œ≤i.ke) is a vigorous style of Cuban music and dance derived, like the conga, from music of Cuban street carnivals or comparsas. It was invented or developed by Pello el Afrokan (Pedro Izquierdo) in 1963.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z p. 114. Music Although the rhythm shares many characteristics with Sub-Saharan African music traditions, it does not have anything to do with music from the African nation of Mozambique. The Cuban mozambique features conga drums, bombos (bass drums), cowbells and trombones. [See: \\"Mozambique Lesson in Cuba, 1985\\" (Pello el Afrokan), and \\"Mozambique Rhythm from Cuba\\" (Kim Atkinson). Izquierdo's composition \\"Mar√≠a Caracoles\\" was later recorded by Santana on their 1977 album Festival. Izquierdo's rhythm made its d√©but in 1963 in Havana on the television programme Ritmos de Juventud, with the presenter surrounded by drummers so in tune with each other that they created a piano-like sound, while simultaneously performing the Mozambique dance. Cuban-style Mozambique bell pattern above rumba clave in 2-3 clave sequence.Quintana \\"Changuito,\\" Jos√© Luis, and Chuck Silverman (1998). Changuito: A Master's Approach to the Timbales, p.70. . . Dance The dance consists of bending the knee and lowering the body at the same time as lifting up a foot while returning the body to its normal upright position, continuing to bend the knees, and lowering the body. The dance looks like a cross between the \\"timeless\\" Afro- Cuban rumba and son, and the African-American twist, which was popular in the States during the early 1960s.Watch the mozambique dance: \\"Maria Caracoles\\" (Pello el Afrokan 1964). Mozambique peaked in 1965, when Izquierdo took a group to the Olympics in Paris, then was quickly discarded.Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1981. M√∫sica cubana del Areyto a la Nueva Trova. 2nd rev ed, p. 296. San Juan P.R.; Cubanacan Despite its short time in the spotlight, first Izquierdo, and later his son, have kept the mozambique alive through recordings and live performances. Mozambique was the first new genre of post- revolution Cuba, and the first popular band music to systemically use rumba clave.Pe√±alosa, David (2009: 81). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins p. 255. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . The mozambique began a new trajectory in band rhythms, which can be heard in its descendants‚Äîsongo and timba.Moore, Kevin 2011. \\"From Arsenio to Songo.\\" Timba.com.

Tico CD 1126 (1965). Although both rhythms are based on conga de comparsa drums, they have no parts in common. [See: \\"The History of the New York-Style Mozambique\\" (Andy Gonzalez interviews Manny Oquendo).] Even the clave patterns are different; Izquierdo's rhythm uses rumba clave, while Palmieri's uses son clave. Izquierdo‚Äôs mozambiques are, for the most part, in major keys. Palmieri‚Äôs mozambiques are mostly in minor keys.Sanabria, Bobby \\"Re: mozambique.\\" Latinjazz Yahoo Group. 17 Sept. 2002. However, both groups primarily use chord progressions in a 2-3 clave sequence, and a trombone horn section. The following piano guajeo is in the New York style. NY-style 2-3 piano guajeo by Rebeca Maule√≥n. Rebeca Maule√≥n makes the point that because Cuban Mozambique originally began as a percussion genre, there is no set piano part for it.Maule√≥n (1993: 214) By contrast, while Izquierdo created specific percussion parts for his Mozambique, the only specific percussion part in the New York style is the bell pattern. Bell pattern The bell pattern used in Palmieri's rhythm was originally a guaguanc√≥ c√°scara pattern.\\"Columbia\\" Carlos Vidal Bolado Ritmo afro-cubano n. 5. 78 RPM phonorecord SMC Pro Arte 2519-A (1949). The Mozambique bell is similar to the pattern used in Havana- style conga de comparsa. Tommy Lopez played congas in Palmieri's group. The bell pattern was first played by Palmieri's timbalero Julito Collazo and later by Manny Oquendo, who came to be closely associated with the Mozambique timbales part.Santos, John 1987. ‚ÄúThe Mozambique‚Äù Modern Drummer Magazine p. 86. [See: \\"Mozambique\\" (Manny Oquendo).] The NY Mozambique bell was later adopted by drumset players in North American jazz and popular music. For example, drummer Steve Gadd can be heard playing the NY Mozambique bell part on drumset (cymbal) during Paul Simon's song \\"Late in the Evening\\".Walden, Rupert M. 1987. \\"Gadd's Mozambique\\" Modern Drummer Magazine, Nov. p. 42 [See: \\"Mozambique\\" (Steve Gadd). Bell pattern for Havana-style conga de comparsa, written in 2-3 clave sequence. NY-style Mozambique bell pattern in 2-3 clave. The NY Mozambique bell is nearly identical to the basic songo stick pattern.Pe√±alosa, David 2010. Rumba Quinto p. 148. Redway, CA: Bembe Books. [See: \\"Basic Songo for Drum Kit\\" (Ignacio Berroa). The only difference is the stroke on main beat 3, sounded in the songo pattern. Both songo and NY Mozambique departed from the typical \\"angular\\" rhythms used in son montuno, mambo, and salsa, allowing more improvisational freedom for the conga drummer throughout the song.

It lies on the Forth and Clyde Canal and on the south side of Strathkelvin, about northeast of central Glasgow. Historically part of Dunbartonshire, the town is the administrative centre of the East Dunbartonshire council area, and its population in 2009 was estimated at 19,700.

This, in turn, may come from a Cumbric name, Caer-pen-taloch, which has the same meaning.Origin of the Name - Peter Drummond A possible reference to the site is made in the 9th century Welsh text Historia Brittonum, in which the Antonine Wall is said to end at 'Caerpentaloch'. The fort referred to is the former Roman settlement on the wall and the hillock is the volcanic drumlin which would have offered a strategic viewpoint for miles to the West, North and East. The etymology is sometimes taken literally as \\"Kirk in tilloch\\" (\\"church in the field\\"). Its long name is often shortened by locals to the colloquial Kirkie or Kirky, as reflected in a number of business names in the town. History The first known settlement on the site of what is now Kirkintilloch was a Roman fort established in what is now the Peel Park area of the town. Dating from the mid-2nd century, the Antonine Wall, one of the northernmost frontiers in Roman Britannia was routed through Kirkintilloch; its course continues through the centre of the town to this day, although little trace can now be seen above ground. A digital reconstruction of the fort has been created. There are many archeological artifacts found in Kirkintilloch on display at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. There is no strong evidence of habitation on the site for the following thousand years until Clan Cumming established a castle (Motte and Bailey) and church there in the 12th century. A small settlement grew and was granted burgh status in 1211, becoming an important staging post for west‚Äìeast journeys from Glasgow to eastern and north-eastern Scotland. From this time, a weekly market was held in the town, probably at the foot of Peel Brae (along with High Street and Cowgate, one of the three medieval thoroughfares in the town). The castle was of some importance during the wars of independence when an English garrison was stationed there, commanded by Sir Philip de Moubray, who was later to command Stirling Castle at the time of the Battle of Bannockburn. Soldiers from the castle were dispatched to arrest William Wallace at Robroyston in 1305 and escorted him to Dumbarton Castle. Later the same year, the garrison is recorded as having sent a petition to King Edward of England complaining of non-payment of wages. The castle was attacked by Scottish forces in 1306 under Bishop Wishart of Glasgow (using timber given to Glasgow diocese by the English for cathedral repairs), but the siege was unsuccessful. The castle is thought to have been destroyed on the orders of Robert Bruce later in the conflict, although the traces of a mot surrounded by a ditch can still be seen in the Peel Park. The original Cumming parish church, St Ninian's, was constructed around 1140 some distance to the east of the town (where some of the stones remain in the form of an 18th- century watchtower at the entrance to the Auld Aisle Cemetery) as Kirkintilloch was originally in the parish of Lenzie which stretched from Cumbernauld in the East to Kirkintilloch in the West. The establishment was part of the endowment of Cambuskenneth Abbey, and was accompanied by a grant of one oxgang of land (approximately 15 acres), the measurement that lent its name to the area near the church. A chapel to the Virgin Mary was established in the town itself, sometime before 1379, and was endowed with land at Duntiblae by Sir David Fleming. The move of the parish church to the site of the chapel at Kirkintilloch Cross (now the Auld Kirk Museum) in 1644 resulted in a split of the Parish into Easter and Wester Lenzie (later Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch Parishes) The name Lenzie was later reused for Kirkintilloch's railway station on the main Glasgow to Edinburgh line, around which the later village of that name developed. Following the Scottish victory in the wars of independence and the subsequent decline of Clan Cumming, the baronies of Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, and Cumbernauld were granted by Robert Bruce to Sir Malcolm Fleming, Sheriff of Dumbarton and a supporter of the Bruce faction in the war. Hitherto part of Stirlingshire, the area subsequently became a detached part of the county of Dumbarton, in which it remains today. On 3 January 1746, the retreating Jacobite army of Charles Stuart made its way through Kirkintilloch, on its way back from Derby, and on the march to Falkirk and ultimately Culloden. One of the Highland army's stragglers was shot dead at the town cross by a man hidden in a barn at the Kiln Close (where the library now stands). On hearing of the murder, Charles halted his army on the Kilsyth road and threatened to turn back and burn the town. The town magistrates persuaded him to continue marching, in return for an unspecified payment, and the town was spared. The town was one of the hotbeds of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland, beginning with the emergence of a booming textile industry in the area. There were 185 weavers in Kirkintilloch by 1790, and in 1867 James Slimon's cotton mill at Kelvinside employed 200 women. With the construction of the Forth and Clyde Canal through the town in 1773, and the establishment of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway in 1826, Kirkintilloch developed further as an important transportation hub, inland port and production centre for iron, coal, nickel and even small ships. This industrial heritage lives on in the town's designation as the \\"Canal Capital of Scotland\\", and in the redevelopment of the canal and surrounding former industrial sites in the early 21st century. By the 20th century, the principal employers in the town were the shipbuilders J & J Hay and Peter McGregor, and the Lion (1880‚Äì1984) and Star foundries, all of which produced goods for the domestic market and for export around the world. Kirkintilloch's most famous exports were the distinctive red British postboxes and phoneboxes K2 to K6, produced in the town until 1984 and still to be found as far afield as Taiwan and Mississippi. Listed versions of these boxes still stand at the foot of Alexandra Street in the centre of Kirkintilloch. Kirkintilloch was a \\"dry town\\" for much of its recent history, with the sale of alcohol on public premises banned from 1923 until 1967. The prohibition on the sale of alcohol had long been demanded by the Liberal Party and the temperance movement, both of which had a strong influence in the town in the early part of the 20th century, largely due to the perceived negative effects of alcohol on the town's inhabitants. The 1960s development plan to redevelop inner city areas of Glasgow saw Kirkintilloch used as an overspill settlement for relocated Glaswegians in combination with the new towns of Livingston and Cumbernauld, offering employment in housebuilding and an increase to the local population to its current levels. Large numbers of new houses for owner occupation have been built since that time. Governance Kirkintilloch and Lenzie had their own burgh council until the 1975 abolition of the counties of Scotland when it became part of the Strathkelvin local government district within the region of Strathclyde. A second reorganisation in 1996 established East Dunbartonshire council from Strathkelvin and the adjacent district of Bearsden and Milngavie; with Kirkintilloch is its administrative centre and the council's headquarters at Tom Johnston House in the town, named after prominent early 20th century politician, Secretary of State for Scotland (1941-45) and Kirkintilloch native, Thomas Johnston. The council's headquarters moved to the William Patrick Library in August 2012, forming the local authority's first community hub. Tom Johnstone House was demolished in 2015, a mere 30 years after it was built. Geography As well as the Forth and Clyde Canal the Luggie Water passes through Kirkintilloch, the canal crossing the Luggie on an aqueduct. The Luggie flows into the River Kelvin which in turn flows into the River Clyde in Glasgow. Communities in and around Kirkintilloch include: Cleddans; Harestanes; Hayston; Hillhead; Oxgang; Rosebank; Langmuir; Greens; Fauldhead; Waterside; Westermains; Lenzie: Gallowhill: Whitegates; Back O' Loch; Woodilee; Broomhill etc. Culture Kirkintilloch Town Hall was opened in 1906, paid for by public subscription. Listed as a building of special architectural or historic interest, it was closed by East Dunbartonshire Council in June 2004, largely due to the anticipated expense of restoring a building constructed of notoriously crumbling soft sandstone. In response the Kirkintilloch Town Hall Preservation Trust was established as a registered charity to preserve the hall and restore it for community use. Work began on the redevelopment of the hall in early summer 2016, with major works completed in October 2017. Kirkintilloch Town Hall officially reopened in November 2018. The town is served by the William Patrick Library, which moved from a converted private villa near Peel Park to a new building on West High Street in the 1990s. The titular William Patrick was a local minister whose brother donated funds to the local people to have a library founded in William's name. The neglected old library was sold by the council back into private ownership and returned to residential use after restoration works. William Patrick Library is the main library for East Dunbartonshire Council and also houses the reference department and other council offices including social services, planning and a new community hub. Kirkintilloch underwent significant population growth in the post-Second World War period, with several new amenities erected to cater for the growing population of the town and its surrounding villages. New shopping facilities were built in the Cowgate and Townhead areas, culminating in the opening, by Diana, Princess of Wales, of the Regent Centre shopping mall in the 1990s. The local swimming pool and Community Education Centre, built in the 1960s and '70s in Woodhead Park to the south of the town, were demolished in 1999 and 2005 respectively. Woodhead Park was once home to a petting zoo, bandstand, greenhouses, putting green and public toilets. All are now closed, although a new leisure centre was opened on the same spot as the old pool in July 2007, providing facilities for tennis, badminton, swimming, football and a gymnasium. A large new children's play area has been created near the site of the former putting green in the park. The construction of the new leisure centre came in combination with a wider-ranging artistic, cultural and social regeneration project called Kirkintilloch's Initiative. This includes the new link road largely funded by housebuilders developing on the site of the former Woodilee Hospital. Kirkintilloch Learning Centre is located on Southbank Road, overlooking the Forth and Clyde Canal, an offshoot of Cumbernauld College. Locally, a G66+ Live! Cultural festival offers a wide range of events from talks on history in local churches to musical events in the town's local bars, such as Bar Bliss, dramas and also entries from the schools in the G66 postcode area. G66+ Live! is annual festival taking place in June. Kirkintilloch's most successful musical ensemble is its brass band, the Kirkintilloch Band, who were crowned Scottish Brass Band Champions in 2007 and who have had success in competitions both in Scotland and further afield. Each August the local Canal Festival takes place. An amateur theatre group, the Kirkintilloch Players, is based at the Turret Theatre in the Eastside area of Kirkintilloch, the former home of the town's Liberal Club. The town has a pipe band of the same name, Kirkintilloch Pipe Band. Established on 12 November 1888 it is one of, if not the oldest civilian pipe band in the world. The band takes part in civic and private events in the local and surrounding areas and also takes part in competition. Its pipers and drummers are mostly from the local area and the band still practises weekly in the Hillhead Community Centre. Education There are six primary schools in Kirkintilloch, which are Hillhead, Harestanes, Oxgang, Gartconner, Lairdsland and Holy Family. There are also two schools in the area for children with special needs, these being Merkland School in Hillhead and Campsie View School in Lenzie. The two secondary schools in the area are Kirkintilloch High School (Non-denominational) and St Ninian's High School (Roman Catholic) Both schools recently constructed new-build campuses, which were completed in August 2009. In the Lenzie area primary schools include Lenzie Meadow Primary, Millersneuk and Holy Family Primary. Holy Family is a Catholic school on the edge of Lenzie on the border with Kirkintilloch, and is a feeder to St Ninian's High School. The other two non-denomination schools in the area feed onto Lenzie Academy, along with Lairdsland Primary in Kirkintilloch and the nearby Auchinloch Primary.

Lenzie rugby club is based in the town, playing their home games at Viewfield Avenue. They are in West regional league 1, the 4th tier of Scottish club rugby. After the town had been without such facilities for the better part of a decade a replacement swimming pool and gym finally opened in July 2007 at Woodhead Park. The town is also home to the \\"Kirkintilloch Olympians\\", a local athletics club. Kirkintilloch is also the home of Aberdeen and former Rangers player Gregg Wylde and Celtic and Scotland player, Charlie Mulgrew. Lenzie Youth Club is a local football club founded in 1980 by Ian Stevenson which has sections from age 5 upwards. Famous ex Lenzie Youth Club players include Barry Bannan and Stephen Crainey. Churches There are a number of churches in Kirkintilloch. The four Church of Scotland congregations are: St Mary's, St David's Memorial Park, St Columba's and Hillhead. The Baptist Union of Scotland has churches at Townhead and Harestanes. There are two Roman Catholic Churches - St Flannan's in Hillhead, and Holy Family and St Ninian's in the town centre. Jehovah's Witnesses have a congregation in Kirkintilloch which shares a Kingdom Hall with its sister congregation in Bishopbriggs. The Edinburgh Gazette of 17 November 1896 announces \\"INTIMATION is hereby given that the Reverend THOMAS ANGUS MORRISON, Minister of the Parish of Kirkintilloch, in the Presbytery of Glasgow and County of Dumbarton, has, under and by virtue of \\"The Glebe Lands (Scotland) Act, 1866,\\" presented a ; Petition to the Lords of Council and Session, Commissioners for the Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, for authority to Feu the GLEBE OF KIRKINTILLOCH ; and that an Interlocutor has been pronounced therein in the following terms....\\" After depositing ¬£400 with the \\"Lord of the Manor\\" or \\"Patron\\" T Angus Morrison becomes Minister of St Mary's. The original church was old and damp, T Angus Morrison built up his congregation and it was soon to outgrow the old church or kirk. Travelling throughout the UK T Angus Morrison worked with the Architect, George Bell of Glasgow. Thomas Angus Morrison was born in Motherwell, but for much of his youth he lived in Glasgow and attended school in Dennistoun. Commencing his ministerail career as an Assistant at the Plantation Church in Govan he was soon to move to St Mary's Church as assistant to the Reverened Mr Craven in 1890. T Angus Morrison was to marry a local girl, Mary Stewart Galloway Smillie, sole surviving child of James Smillie of Fearndean, a local Kirkintilloch family, tracing their family back to the town of the 1790s. T Angus Morrison and Mary were to have seven children, one of the sons, William Angus Galloway Morrison dying on the Siam Burmese Railway in World War Two. The Reverened T Angus Morrison was born in Shotts, near Motherwell in 1862, died suddenly in 1941 at the age of 79 having served St Mary's for 51 years. In addition to a long career as Presbyterian minister, the Reverened T Angus Morrison was a Freemason and had become Provincial Grand Master to the Province of Dunbartonshire from 1921 until his death.

As documented in the Hossbach Memorandum, Hitler had been dissatisfied with the two high-ranking military officials concerned, Werner von Blomberg and Werner von Fritsch, and he regarded them as too hesitant towards the war preparations that he was demanding. Hitler took further advantage of the situation by replacing several generals and ministers with men more loyal to him. Hitler took personal command of the armed forces through the new Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) after the defeat outside Moscow in December 1941 and appointed himself as commander of the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) after Walther von Brauchitsch was relieved and transferred to the leadership reserve (F√ºhrerreserve). Hitler then began participating at OKW, where Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel never dared to oppose him. Blomberg marriage The Blomberg‚ÄìFritsch affair began soon after the marriage on 12 January 1938 of the War Minister Werner von Blomberg to Erna Gruhn, when the Berlin police discovered she had a long criminal record and had posed for pornographic photographs. According to testimony given much later, at the Nuremberg trials, information received by the Police Commissioner within days also indicated that \\"Marshal von Blomberg's wife had been a previously convicted prostitute who had been registered as a prostitute in the files of seven large German cities; she was in the Berlin criminal files. ... She had also been sentenced by the Berlin courts for distributing indecent pictures.\\"Nuremberg Trial Proceedings, Volume 12. One hundred and fourteenth day, 25 April 1946, Morning Session‚Äîvia Avalon Project. Yale Law School. Accessed 4 June 2020. Marriage to a person with such a criminal record violated the standard of conduct expected of officers, as defined by Blomberg himself, and came as a shock to Hitler, as Luftwaffe chief Hermann G√∂ring had been Blomberg's best man, and Hitler himself had served as a witness at the wedding. Hitler and G√∂ring saw the development as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg.Gerwarth, Robert, Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich, Yale University Press, 2011, p. 116, Hitler ordered Blomberg to have the marriage annulled to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army. Blomberg refused to annul the marriage but after G√∂ring threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge, he resigned from his posts on 27 January 1938. Fritsch affair The events surrounding Blomberg's marriage inspired Hermann G√∂ring and Heinrich Himmler to arrange a similar affair for Commander-in-Chief Werner von Fritsch. G√∂ring did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior. Himmler wanted to weaken the Wehrmacht and its mainly-aristocratic generals to strengthen his Schutzstaffel (SS), as a competitor to the regular German Army (Heer). In 1936, Reinhard Heydrich had prepared a file on Fritsch that had allegations of homosexuality and had passed the information on to Hitler, but Hitler had rejected it and ordered Heydrich to destroy the file. However, Heydrich did not do so.Gerwarth, Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich, p. 116 In 1938, Heydrich resurrected the old file on Fritsch, who was again accused of being a homosexual by Himmler.Gerwarth, Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich, pp. 116-117 It was reported that Fritsch had been encouraged by General Ludwig Beck to carry out a military putsch against the Hitler regime but that he declined and resigned on 4 February 1938, to be replaced by Walther von Brauchitsch, whom Fritsch had recommended for the post.Wheeler-Bennett, Nemesis, p. 369 Reorganisation of army Hitler used the situation to transfer the duties of the Ministry of War (Reichskriegsministerium) to a new organisation, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW), and Wilhelm Keitel, who became the new head of the OKW on 4 February 1938.Keitel, according to his memoirs, had met Hitler on 26 January 1938 to discuss Blomberg's successor. At the meeting, Keitel records that Hitler showed him the indictment against Fritsch under Paragraph 175 of the penal code and explained that despite his efforts to suppress the matter, it had now come to a head. See Irving, In the Service of the Reich, p. 51 That weakened the traditional Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, or OKH), which was now subordinated to the OKW. Hitler took further advantage of the situation by replacing several generals and ministers with men even more loyal to him and took more effective de facto control of the Wehrmacht, which de jure, he already commanded. Some senior officers of the Wehrmacht protested against the changes, most notably Colonel General Ludwig Beck, who circulated a petition signed by Colonel General Gerd von Rundstedt and others. Disapproval of charges against Fritsch It became known that the charges against Fritsch were false. The information in the file was, in fact, about a Rittmeister (cavalry captain), called Achim von Frisch. Himmler and Heydrich still pursued the case, conveniently discovering an individual, called Hans Schmidt, to serve as a witness in support of the charge. The Wehrmacht demanded a court of honour of officers to examine the Blomberg‚ÄìFritsch Affair, as it had come to be known. The proceedings were presided over by Hermann G√∂ring. Schmidt claimed to recognise Fritsch as an officer whom he had witnessed in a homosexual act in a public lavatory with a man, known in translation as \\"Bavarian Joe\\".Gisevius, Hans, To the Bitter End, p. 229 However, Schmidt was exposed as a notorious criminal whose Berlin gang had specialized in the blackmail of homosexuals.Gerwarth, Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich, p. 117 Members of the German officer corps were appalled at the mistreatment of Fritsch, and at the next meeting, Himmler, G√∂ring and even Hitler might have come under pressure from them, as the case against Fritsch was seen as weak.Deutsch, Harold Charles, Hitler and His Generals: The Hidden Crisis, January‚ÄìJune 1938, University of Minnesota Press, 1974, p. 248. The successful annexation (Anschluss) of Austria shortly thereafter, however, silenced the critics. Colonel General Beck resigned on 18 August 1938 and Colonel General von Rundstedt obtained permission to retire in October 1938. Schmidt withdrew his accusations against Fritsch and he was formally acquitted on 18 March, but the damage to his reputation had been done. Although the army demanded he be restored to his former position as Commander-in-Chief, Hitler would only make him honorary colonel of an artillery regiment. Just after the German invasion of Poland, Fritsch was inspecting front-line troops when he was shot in the leg and died.

By avoiding direct meetings, they could maintain operational security. The method stands in contrast to the live drop, so-called because two persons meet to exchange items or information. Overview Spies (covert intelligence agents) and their handlers have been known to perform dead drops using various techniques to hide items (such as money, secrets or instructions), and to signal that the drop has been made. Although the signal and location by necessity must be agreed upon in advance, the signal may or may not be located close to the dead drop itself. The operatives may not necessarily know one another or ever meet. Considerations The location and nature of the dead drop must enable retrieval of the hidden item without the operatives being spotted by a member of the public, the police, or other security forces‚Äîtherefore, common everyday items and behavior are used to avoid arousing suspicion. Any hidden location could serve, although often a cut-out device is used, such as a loose brick in a wall, a (cut-out) library book, or a hole in a tree. Dead drop spike A dead drop spike is a concealment device similar to a microcache. It has been used since the late 1960s to hide money, maps, documents, microfilm, and other items. The spike is water- and mildew-proof and can be pushed into the ground or placed in a shallow stream to be retrieved at a later time. Signaling devices can include a chalk mark on a wall, a piece of chewing-gum on a lamppost, or a newspaper left on a park bench. Alternatively, the signal can be made from inside the agent's own home, by, for example, hanging a distinctively-colored towel from a balcony, or placing a potted plant on a window sill where it is visible to anyone on the street. Drawbacks While the dead drop method is useful in preventing the instantaneous capture of either an operative/handler pair or an entire espionage network, it is not without disadvantages. If one of the operatives is compromised, they may reveal the location and signal for that specific dead drop. Counterintelligence can then use the dead drop as a double agent for a variety of purposes, such as to feed misinformation to the enemy or to identify other operatives using it or ultimately to booby trap it. Modern techniques On January 23, 2006, the Russian FSB accused Britain of using wireless dead drops concealed inside hollowed-out rocks (\\"spy rock\\") to collect espionage information from agents in Russia. According to the Russian authorities, the agent delivering information would approach the rock and transmit data wirelessly into it from a hand-held device, and later his British handlers would pick up the stored data by similar means.

She is best remembered for her singing with the Glenn Miller Orchestra from 1938 to 1942. She was the sister of actress and singer Betty Hutton. Early life Born as Marion Thornburg in Fort Smith, Arkansas, she was the elder sister of actress Betty Hutton. They were raised in Battle Creek, Michigan. The sisters' father abandoned the family when they were both young; he later committed suicide. Their mother worked a variety of jobs to support the family until she became a successful bootlegger.Marion Hutton biodata, slipcue.com; accessed September 26, 2015. Both sisters sang with the Vincent Lopez Orchestra.Betty Hutton obituary, independent.co.uk; accessed September 26, 2015.

He was like a father because I never had a father I remembered.\\" Miller wanted Hutton to appear as an all-American girl, so on her first few performances, he introduced her as \\"Sissy Jones.\\" The pseudonym was not used beyond those first performances.Simon, pp.138-139 Hutton was not allowed to sing in the nightclubs due to the fact she was underage. Miller and his wife Helen signed papers to officially declare themselves foster parents to serve as Hutton's chaperone in the nightclubs which allowed her access in these venues. Marion Hutton considered herself more an entertainer than a singer.Simon, p. 139 Hutton remained an important part of the Miller band.Simon, pp. 260-61 She remained with Miller on and off, until the orchestra disbanded in 1942. Film career Hutton with Mel Torm√© and Gordon MacRae in 1947. Jeanine Basinger, a film historian and professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, refers to Hutton in her chapter on Marion's younger sister, actress and singer Betty Hutton in the 2007 book The Star Machine. Basinger asserts that in the early forties, Marion was more popular than her sister Betty.This book is a study of the studio system in Hollywood. Marion Hutton had a small role in the film Orchestra Wives (1942; Twentieth Century Fox), in which the Glenn Miller Orchestra starred. After Miller joined the Army in 1942, she went with fellow Miller performers Tex Beneke and the Modernaires on a theater tour.Simon, p. 314 The next important event in her entertainment career was a role in In Society with Abbott and Costello in 1944. Marion Hutton appeared with the Desi Arnaz orchestra in October 1947 at the Radio City Theatre in Minneapolis.\\"Solid: Marion Hutton\\" As the 1940s wound down, so did Marion's career. Her last film role was in 1949, acting in the Marx Brothers' Love Happy. Personal life Hutton was married three times. She married publicist and television producer Jack Philbin in 1940. She and Philbin had two sons, John and Phillip. Her next marriage, to writer Jack Douglas, produced a third son, Peter. Peter Hemming is a noted photojournalist. Her last and longest marriage was in 1954 to Vic Schoen, an arranger for the Andrews Sisters and Bing Crosby, among other artists in the 1940s. The couple remained married until her death in 1987.\\"Solid: Vic Schoen\\" Looking back on her first marriage, in 1974 she told George T. Simon, \\"[W]hat I wanted most of all was to be a wife and mother. I had no drive for a career.\\"Simon, p. 224 In 1965 according to the New York Times, Marion Hutton sought treatment for various addictions. Hutton went back to school in her late fifties. She received two psychology degrees and found work at a local hospital. During the 1960s and 70s, Hutton and Schoen lived in Laguna Beach but later moved due to increasing financial problems. In 1981, Hutton and Schoen moved from Irvine, California to Kirkland, Washington, and founded Residence XII, a drug addiction center to help alcoholics and addicts. She was the executive director. Schoen and Hutton performed many fund raisers for this addiction center. Hutton and Schoen had both struggled with alcoholism and in the 1970s both were finally able to quit drinking and joined AA. They attended meetings regularly until the late 1980s and helped many struggling alcoholics by recounting their anecdotes and life lessons they had learned throughout the years.

It is native to Arctic to cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant producing flowering stems in early spring, and large leaves through the summer. The upright flowering stems are 10‚Äì20 cm tall, and bear only 5-12 inflorescences, yellowish-white to pink in colour. The leaves are rounded, 15‚Äì20 cm broad, with a deeply cleft base and shallowly lobed margin, and rise directly from the underground rootstock. The underside of the leaves is covered with matted, woolly fuzz. It grows in moist shaded ground, preferring stream banks and seeping ground of cut-banks.

Description The species is dioecious, the male and female flowers being borne on separate plants. In Britain, the male flowers are widespread, but the female flowers have a restricted distribution in northern and central England. The flowers are produced in the early spring, before the leaves appear. They are pale pink, with several inflorescences clustered on a stem. The leaves are large, on stout tall stems, round, with a diameter of with petioles up to . It is also called bog rhubarb, Devil's hat, and pestilence wort. Synonyms include P. officinalis, P. ovatus, P. vulgaris, and Tussilago petasites L. Distribution It is native to central Europe, extending from the British Isles to the Caucasus, and from southern Italy north to southern Scandinavia. It is present as an introduced species in North America. In the British Isles, female plants are rarely found outside central and northern England, and the species may be naturalized as clonal populations outside this area, propagating via rhizome fragments. The preferred habitats are moist, fertile soils, often by rivers, streams and in wet meadows.  Herbalism  Petasites hybridus leaves have been used in the traditional Austrian and Czech medicine internally (as tea or cold maceration in ethanol) and externally (as compresses or maceration in vinegar) for treatment of infections, fever, flu, colds, hay-fever, and allergies.  Potential medicinal uses  Preliminary trials have shown a preparation of butterbur root to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. A commercial extract Petasol butenoate complex (Ze 339) has proved helpful for allergic rhinitis.

At the height of their popularity, these strips attracted over 100 million readers every day. Falk also wrote short stories, and he contributed to a series of pulp novels about The Phantom. A playwright and theatrical director/producer, Falk directed actors such as Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Paul Newman, Chico Marx and Ethel Waters. Life and career Falk was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where he spent his boyhood and his youth. His mother was Eleanor Alina (a name he later, in some form, used in both his Mandrake the Magician and The Phantom story lines), and his father was Benjamin Gross. Both of his parents were Jewish. Lee was born and raised Jewish. Benjamin Gross died when Falk was just a boy, and after a time, his mother Eleanor married Albert Falk Epstein, who became the father figure for Lee Falk and his brother, Leslie. Falk changed his surname after leaving college. He took the middle name of his stepfather, but \\"Lee\\" had been his nickname since childhood, so he took that name also. His brother, Leslie, also took the name \\"Falk\\". When Falk began his comic strip and comic book writing and drawing career, his official biography claimed that he was an experienced world traveler who had studied with Eastern mystics. In fact, Falk had simply made it up in order to seem more like the right kind of person to be writing about globe-trotting heroes like Mandrake the Magician and The Phantom. His trip to New York City to pitch Mandrake the Magician for publication by the King Features Syndicate was at that time the farthest that he had traveled from home in St. Louis. In later life, however, he became an experienced world traveler for real ‚Äì at least partly, he said, to avoid the embarrassment of having his bluff inadvertently called by genuine travelers wanting to swap anecdotes. During World War II, Falk also worked as chief of propaganda for the new radio station KMOX at St. Louis, where he became the leader of the radio foreign language division of the Office of War Information. Lee Falk married three times, to Louise Kanaseriff, Constance Moorehead Lilienthal, and Elizabeth Moxley (he married Elizabeth, a respected stage-director, not long before he decided to depict the marriage of The Phantom to the character's longtime girlfriend Diana Palmer in Falk's The Phantom comic strip). Elizabeth also sometimes helped him with the scripts in his later years. She even finished his last The Phantom stories after he died. Falk became the father of three children, Valerie (his daughter with Louise Kanaseriff), and Diane and Conley (his daughter and son with Constance Moorehead Lilienthal). Falk died on March 13, 1999. Creation of Mandrake the Magician and The Phantom Falk had had a fascination for stage magicians ever since he was a boy. Falk, according to his own recollections, sketched the first few Mandrake the Magician comic strips himself. When asked why the magician looked so much like himself, he replied, \\"Well, of course he did. I was alone in a room with a mirror when I drew him!\\". The Phantom was inspired by Falk‚Äôs fascination for myths and legends, such as the ones about El Cid, King Arthur, Nordic and Greek folklore heroes and popular fictional characters like \\"Tarzan\\" and \\"Mowgli\\" from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. He was fascinated by the Thugs of India, and hence based his first Phantom comic on the \\"Singh Brotherhood\\". Falk originally considered the idea of calling his character \\"The Gray Ghost\\", but finally decided that he preferred \\"The Phantom\\". Falk revealed in an interview that Robin Hood, who was often depicted as wearing tights, inspired the skin-tight costume of \\"The Phantom\\", which is known to have influenced the entire superhero-industry. In the A&E; Network's Phantom biography program, Falk explained that Ancient Greek stone busts inspired the notion of pupils of the eyes of \\"The Phantom\\" not showing whenever he wore his mask. The old Greek busts had no eye pupils, which Falk felt gave them an inhuman, interesting look. It is also probable that the look of \\"The Phantom\\" inspired the look of what has today become known as the \\"superhero\\". Falk originally thought that his comic strips would last a few weeks at best. However, he wrote them for more than six decades, until the last days of his life.  Theater  Falk's next large passion after cartooning was the theater and stage plays. During his lifetime, Falk ran five theaters, at one time or another, and he produced about 300 plays, and also directed about 100 of them. Falk wrote 12 plays, including two musicals: Happy Dollar and Mandrake the Magician, which were both based on his comic strip character. After Falk's death, his widow Elizabeth directed a musical called Mandrake the Magician and the Enchantress, which was written by Falk, and which was practically the same as his previous Mandrake the Magician musical. Some of his plays drew well- known actors and actresses such as Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Celeste Holm, Constance Moore, Basil Rathbone, Chico Marx, Ethel Waters, Paul Newman, Ezio Pinza, James Mason, Jack Warner, Shelley Winters, Farley Granger, Eve Arden, Alexis Smith, Victor Jory, Cedric Hardwicke, Eva Marie Saint, Eva Gabor, Sarah Churchill, James Donn, Eddie Bracken, Ann Corio, Robert Wilcox and Paul Robeson to perform in them. The actors and actresses were all paid for their work, but many of them worked on small fractions of what they would normally earn with their movie work. Falk was proud to state that Marlon Brando had turned down an offer of $10,000 a week to act in Broadway plays, in favor of working for Falk in Boston in the play, Arms and the Man. In 1953, Brando's contract for Falk's play paid less than $500 a week. Awards and recognition Falk won many awards for his dedication to the field of writing for comics and theatre. Here are a select few of them: * (1971) *Roman Lifetime Achievement Award *Adamson Award for best foreign comics creator (Sweden, 1977) *Golden Adamson (Sweden, 1986) * In 1989, he was awarded the Inkpot Award.Inkpot Award *National Cartoonists Society's Silver T-Square Award (1986) *In May 1994, his birthplace St. Louis honored him with Lee Falk Day. * In 2013, he was entered into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame. On the occasion of the premiere of the movie, The Phantom, which starred Billy Zane, Falk was congratulated by letter from President Bill Clinton with his best wishes. Lee Falk has also been a candidate for a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame many times, and was so honored in a ceremony on what would have been his 104th birthday, April 28, 2015.

He was once deputy leader of the National Party in the New Zealand Parliament, and was considered by many to be a possible contender for the leadership itself. He was known for his polite and diplomatic style, which often contrasted with the political situation around him ‚Äì Michael Laws described him as \\"a refugee from the age of manners.\\" Early life and family Gair was born in Dunedin, but moved to Wellington when young. He was a graduate of Victoria University and University of Auckland. He worked as a journalist at The New Zealand Herald from 1945 to 1947 then travelled to Japan before moving to Melbourne where he worked for The Sun News-Pictorial from 1949 to 1950 before returning to New Zealand after accepting a position at the Auckland Star between 1950 and 1952. Gair married Esther Mary Fay Levy in about 1950, and the couple went on to have three children, including make-up artist and body painter Joanne Gair. From 1952 to 1957 Gair was a public relations officer in Auckland. He also became involved in the organisational wing of the National Party, and briefly served on the parliamentary staff of Keith Holyoake from 1958 to 1960. From 1960 to 1966 he was the personal assistant to the general manager of Air New Zealand. Member of Parliament He was an organiser for the National Party in the Onehunga and Roskill electorates. He then became the deputy chairman of National's Auckland division and a dominion councillor of the party. Gair first stood for the National Party nomination for the Remuera electorate in the 1966 election, losing the nomination to Allan Highet. Gair then went across the bridge and contested and won the North Shore nomination from retiring National MP Dean Eyre. He was successful, and was elected to Parliament that year.\\"Members of the House of Representatives Elected-General Election\\" (15 January 1970) 1 New Zealand Gazette 1 at 24. In 1969 he was appointed Parliamentary Under- Secretary of Education and Science. Cabinet minister In Parliament, Gair came to be regarded as a competent and diligent administrator. He briefly became Minister of Customs in 1972\\"Ministers Appointed\\" (9 February 1972) 12 New Zealand Gazette 253 at 254.\\"Members of the Executive Council Appointed\\" (9 February 1972) 12 New Zealand Gazette 253. at the end of the Second National government, but this was interrupted when National lost the 1972 election to the Labour Party under Norman Kirk. When National was returned to power in the 1975 election, Gair was returned to cabinet in the Third National government. Between that time and National's defeat in the 1984 election, Gair held a number of challenging portfolios, including serving as Minister of Health and Minister of Social Welfare. He also served as Minister of Housing, Minister of Energy, Minister of Transport, Minister of Railways and a number of other roles. Political views Gair also distinguished himself for some of his personal views. Gair, although a member of the country's main conservative party, generally adopted a \\"live and let live\\" approach to social and moral issues, rejecting what he saw as \\"intolerance\\" in some of his colleagues. These beliefs were especially noticeable when, in the late 1970s, Gair opposed measures to restrict abortion. Barry Gustafson, in his history of the National Party, called Gair \\"the most effective strategist of the parliamentary pro- abortion lobby\\". Gair's support of abortion earned him the hostility of many National Party colleagues, including that of the party's leader, Robert Muldoon. Muldoon was already somewhat distrustful of Gair, as Gair had occasionally been spoken of as an alternative party leader. The political styles of Muldoon and Gair were radically different ‚Äì Muldoon had a reputation as being tough and confrontational, while Gair was seen as polite and diplomatic. Some members of the party who disliked Muldoon's \\"dictatorial\\" style saw Gair as a possible alternative. Colonels' Coup In 1980, when a number of party dissidents began to plot against Muldoon's leadership, Gair was on the list of potential replacements. However, Gair was regarded as too liberal to gain majority support within the party. The dissidents eventually decided to encourage Brian Talboys, the party's deputy leader, to make a leadership bid (now called the \\"Colonels' Coup\\"). Gair was not involved in planning this bid, but was supportive of it, and worked hard to convince Talboys that a challenge was a good idea. In the end, however, Talboys bailed out, and the coup collapsed without a vote ever being taken. Gair continued to advocate a challenge, but Talboys was adamant that preserving party unity was more important than curbing Muldoon's damaging leadership style. Later, after Talboys had retired from politics, Gair supported another Muldoon opponent, Derek Quigley, to replace Talboys as deputy leader. Some time after Muldoon was finally deposed by Jim McLay in 1984, Gair (along with Muldoon ally Bill Birch) was demoted considerably. This was intended to make room for new, younger figures, who McLay hoped would \\"rejuvenate\\" the party. The move was highly damaging to McLay, however, as it placed both Gair and Birch directly in opposition to him. As two of the most experienced people in the National Party, the two were able to mobilise substantial support in favour of McLay's main rival, Jim Bolger. Bolger quickly defeated McLay, and Gair himself took the position of deputy leader. He was additionally given the coveted finance portfolio by Bolger. Deputy leader Shortly after Gair became deputy leader, he found himself at odds with a number of his colleagues once again. The Homosexual Law Reform Bill, a private bill by Labour's Fran Wilde to lift restrictions on homosexuality, was being hotly debated. Gair was somewhat ambivalent towards the bill, believing that while change was \\"long overdue\\", certain aspects of the bill went too far. On 2 July 1986, Gair's vote blocked a motion of closure on the bill, which would have brought it to a vote ‚Äì because of bad weather, a number of the bill's supporters were unable to be in Parliament that day, and since a few votes could potentially decide the fate of the bill, Gair believed it unfair to let the vote go ahead. Had he voted for closure, the bill would probably have been defeated, and many of the bill's opponents therefore blamed Gair for its subsequent success. One week later, when the vote actually occurred, it passed only by a narrow majority ‚Äì Gair himself eventually voted in favour. Gair found the entire episode highly stressful, and spoke of his desire for reconciliation. Following National's loss at the 1987 election Gair was challenged for the position of deputy leader by Ruth Richardson. Rather than attempt to beat off the challenge, the genial Gair retired voluntarily and backed Bolger's preferred deputy Don McKinnon who narrowly defeated Richardson by a single vote to take his place as deputy leader. Mayor of North Shore City Gair served as the 3rd Mayor of North Shore City from 1995 until 1998, defeating incumbent Paul Titchener. Later life and death Gair retired from Parliament at the 1990 elections. He later served as the High Commissioner to London. He lived in Northcross on the North Shore. Gair died on 17 August 2015. His wife, Fay Gair, died in 2018. Honours and awards In the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours, Gair was made a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. In the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

The growing city has two universities, several hospitals, shopping malls, much light manufacturing industry, sports facilities and an opera. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk began the Turkish War of Independence here in 1919.

The early Greek historian Hecataeus wrote that Amisos was formerly called Enete, the place mentioned in Homer's Iliad. In Book II, Homer says that the ·ºêŒΩŒµœÑŒøŒØ (Enetoi) inhabited Paphlagonia on the southern coast of the Black Sea in the time of the Trojan War (c. 1200 BC). The Paphlagonians are listed among the allies of the Trojans in the war, where their king Pylaemenes and his son Harpalion perished.Homer, Iliad; online version at classics.mit.edu, accessed on 2009-08-18. Book II: \\"The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held Cytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river Parthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.\\" Strabo mentioned that the inhabitants had disappeared by his time.Strab. 12.3 \\"Tieium is a town that has nothing worthy of mention except that Philetaerus, the founder of the family of Attalic Kings, was from there. Then comes the Parthenius River, which flows through flowery districts and on this account came by its name; it has its sources in Paphlagonia itself. And then comes Paphlagonia and the Eneti. Writers question whom the poet means by 'the Eneti,' when he says, 'And the rugged heart of Pylaemenes led the Paphlagonians, from the land of the Eneti, whence the breed of wild mules; for at the present time, they say, there are no Eneti to be seen in Paphlagonia, though some say that there is a village on the Aegialus ten schoeni distant from Amastris.' But Zenodotus writes 'from Enete,' and says that Homer clearly indicates the Amisus of today. And others say that a tribe called Eneti, bordering on the Cappadocians, made an expedition with the Cimmerians and then were driven out to the Adriatic Sea. But the thing upon which there is general agreement is, that the Eneti, to whom Pylaemenes belonged, were the most notable tribe of the Paphlagonians, and that, furthermore, these made the expedition with him in very great numbers, but, losing their leader, crossed over to Thrace after the capture of Troy, and on their wanderings went to the Enetian country, as it is now called. According to some writers, Antenor and his children took part in this expedition and settled at the recess of the Adriatic, as mentioned by me in my account of Italy. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that it was on this account that the Eneti disappeared and are not to be seen in Paphlagonia.\\" It has also been known as Peiraieos by Athenian settlers and even briefly as Pompeiopolis by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus.

Starting the 3rd century BC the city came under the control of Mithridates I, later founder of the Kingdom of Pontus. The Amisos treasure may have belonged to one of the kings. Tumuli, containing tombs dated between 300 BC and 30 BC, can be seen at Amisos Hill but unfortunately Toraman Tepe was mostly flattened during construction of the 20th century radar base. The Romans conquered Amisus in 71 BC during the Third Mithridatic War. and Amisus became part of Bithynia et Pontus province. Around 46 BC, during the reign of Julius Caesar, Amisus became the capital of Roman Pontus. From the period of the Second Triumvirate up to Nero, Pontus was ruled by several client kings, as well as one client queen, Pythodorida of Pontus, a granddaughter of Marcus Antonius. From 62 CE it was directly ruled by Roman governors, most famously by Trajan's appointee Pliny. Pliny the Younger's address to the Emperor Trajan in the 1st century CE \\"By your indulgence, sir, they have the benefit of their own laws,\\" is interpreted by John Boyle Orrery to indicate that the freedoms won for those in Pontus by the Romans was not pure freedom and depended on the generosity of the Roman emperor.Orrery, J.

The city functioned as the commercial capital for the province of Pontus; beating its rival Sinope (now Sinop) due to its position at the head of the trans-Anatolia highway. In Late Antiquity, the city became part of the Dioecesis Pontica within the eastern Roman Empire; later still it was part of the Armeniac Theme.

Given that the early evangelist Christians focused on Jewish diaspora communities, and that the Jewish diaspora in Amisus was a geographically accessible group with a mixed heritage group, it is not surprising that Amisus would be an appealing site for evangelist work. The author of 1 Peter 1:1 addresses the Jewish diaspora of the province of Pontus, along with four other provinces: \\"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia.\\" (Peter 1:1) As Amisus would have been the largest commercial port-city in the province, it is believed certain that the spread of Christianity in the region would have begun there. In the 1st century Pliny the Younger documents accounts of Christians in and around the cities of Pontus.\\"Pliny and Trajan on the Christians.\\" Pliny and Trajan on the Christians. Accessed 7 April 2015. His accounts center on his conflicts with the Christians when he served under the Emperor Trajan and describe early Christian communities, his condemnation of their refusal to renounce their religion, but also describes his tolerance for some Christian practices like Christian charitable societies.Alikin, V. A. (2010). 'Chapter 7.' In The Earliest History of the Christian Gathering: Origin, Development and Content of the Christian Gathering in the First to Third Centuries. Leiden: Brill. p. 270. Many great early Christian figures had connections to Amisus, including Caesarea Mazaca, Gregory the Illuminator (raised as a Christian from 257 CE when he was brought to Amisus) and Basil the Great (Bishop of the city 330‚Äì379 CE).Wilson, M. W. \\"Cities of God in Northern Asia Minor: Using Stark's Social Theories to Reconstruct Peter's Communities\\". Verbum et Ecclesia 32 (1). p. 7. Christian bishops of Amisus include Antonius, who took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451; Erythraeus, a signatory of the letter that the bishops of Helenopontus wrote to Emperor Leo I the Thracian after the killing of Patriarch Proterius of Alexandria; the late 6th-century bishop Florus, venerated as a saint in the Greek menologion; and Tiberius, who attended the Third Council of Constantinople (680), Leo, the Second Council of Nicaea (787), and Basilius, the Council of Constantinople of 879. The diocese is no longer mentioned in the Greek Notitiae Episcopatuum after the 15th century and thereafter the city was considered part of the see of Amasea. However, some Greek bishops of the 18th and 19th centuries bore the title of Amisus as titular bishops.Sim√©on Vailh√©, v. Amisus, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques , vol. XII, Paris 1953, coll. 1289‚Äì1290] In the 13th century the Franciscans had a convent at Amisus, which became a Latin bishopric some time before 1345, when its bishop Paulus was transferred to the recently conquered city of Smyrna and was replaced by the Dominican Benedict, who was followed by an Italian Armenian called Thomas.Jean Richard, La Papaut√© et les missions d'Orient au Moyen Age (XIII-XV si√®cles), √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1977, pp. 170‚Äì171 and 235‚Äì236 No longer a residential diocese, it is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 831 Medieval and modern history Historical building of the Governor's House (\\"Vali konaƒüƒ±\\") of Samsun in Turkey. Atat√ºrk from Istanbul and arrived in Samsun on 19 May 1919, the date which traditionally marks the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence. Views of Amisos Hill in Samsun. Samsun was part of the Seljuk Empire, the Sultanate of Rum, the Empire of Trebizond, and was one of the Genoese colonies. After the breakup of the Seljuk Empire into small principalities (beyliks) in the late 13th century, the city was ruled by one of them, the Isfendiyarids. It was captured from the Isfendiyarids at the end of the 14th century by the rival Ottoman beylik (later the Ottoman Empire) under sultan Bayezid I, but was lost again shortly afterwards. The Ottomans permanently conquered the town in the weeks following 11 August 1420.Zehiroƒülu, A.M. (2018) \\"Trabzon ƒ∞mparatorluƒüu\\" vol.III pp.150‚Äì156 In the later Ottoman period, it became part of the Sanjak of Canik (), which was at first part of the R√ªm Eyalet. The land around the town mainly produced tobacco, with its own type being grown in Samsun, the Samsun-Bafra, which the British described as having \\"small but very aromatic leaves\\", and commanding a \\"high price.\\" The town was connected to the railway system in the second half of the 19th century, and tobacco trade boomed. There was a British consulate in the town from 1837 to 1863. Samsun, then home to an Armenian community numbering over 5,000, was heavily affected during the Armenian Genocide of 1915, the last Armenian Zoroastrians ‚Äì the Arewordik, or children of the sun, lived there. According to local eyewitnesses, such as Hafiz Mehmet, many of the Samsun Armenians were drowned in the Black Sea. Others were deported from Samsun and ultimately massacred in provinces further south. After the Armenian Genocide, there remained eleven Islamized Armenians and two Armenian physicians. Armenian orphans who had survived were given to Turkish families. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk established the Turkish national movement against the Allies in Samsun on 19 May 1919, the date which traditionally marks the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence. Atat√ºrk, appointed by the Ottoman government as Inspector of the Ninth Army Troops Inspectorate of the Empire in eastern Anatolia, left Constantinople aboard the now-famous 16 May for Samsun. Instead of obeying the orders of the Ottoman government, then under the control of the occupying Allies, he and a number of colleagues declared the beginning of the Turkish national movement. As a result of this, the Greek population of Samsun was subject to looting, massacre, and deportation by Turkish irregular groups, as noted by representatives of the American Near East Relief. However these groups couldn't operate freely in Samsun as they did in adjacent region of Merzifon and Bafra due to the presence of the Allied fleet. Being alarmed due to the presence of Greek warships in the vicinity of Samsun, the Turkish national movement undertook the deportation of 21,000 local Greeks to the interior of Anatolia. Later, in early June 1922, the city was bombarded by the Allied navy. By 1920, Samsun's population totaled about 36,000. Demographics During the Tanzimat period and the subsequent wars, Ottoman Muslims were exiled from the Balkans and Circassians were expelled from the Caucasus region. Many of the present inhabitants trace their origins from further west or east on the Black Sea coast. The overwhelming majority of people are Muslims. Government Historical building of Culture and Tourism Directorate. Governor's Office in Samsun. The council has various service units. There is a 2010 to 2014 strategic plan. Samsun has a budget deficit of TL 323 million. Geography Samsun is a long city which extends along the coast between two river deltas which jut into the Black Sea. It is located at the end of an ancient route from Cappadocia: the Amisos of antiquity lay on the headland northwest of the modern city center. The city is growing fast: land has been reclaimed from the sea and many more apartment blocks and shopping malls are currently being built. Industry is tending to move (or be moved) east, further away from the city center and towards the airport. Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak, an important Wetland in the Black Sea area of Turkey Rivers To Samsun's west, lies the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak (\\"Red River\\", the Halys of antiquity), one of the longest rivers in Anatolia and its fertile delta. To the east, lie the Ye≈üilƒ±rmak (\\"Green River\\", the Iris of antiquity) and its delta. The River Mert reaches the sea at the city. Climate Samsun has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen: Cfa), like most of the eastern Black Sea coast of Turkey. Spring temperatures can vary by over 10 degrees from one day to the next. Summers are warm and humid, and the average maximum temperature is around in August. Winters are cool and damp, and the lowest average minimum temperature is around in January. Precipitation is heaviest in late autumn and early winter. Snow sometimes occurs between the months of December and March, but never more than a few centimeters of snow falls in the city, and temperatures below the freezing point rarely last more than a couple of days. The water temperature, as in the whole Turkish Black Sea coast, is always cool, fluctuating between throughout the year. Pollution Samsun Protestant Church Air pollution is a problem in some parts of the city, especially in winter when free coal is supplied to poor families by the government. NOx levels on Y√ºz√ºnc√ºyƒ±l Boulevard are among the highest in the country. Architecture Mosques * Pazar Mosque, Samsun's oldest surviving building, a mosque built by the Ilkhanate Mongols in the 13th century. * Valide or B√ºy√ºk Mosque was built by Batumlu Hacƒ± Efendi in 1884. Its name \\"Valide\\" comes from the mother of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz. * Hacƒ± Hatun Mosque dates from 1694. Churches * Samsun Protestant Church Samsun used to have many Greek Orthodox churches however all got either destroyed or converted to mosques. Transport AnsaldoBreda Sirio in Samsun Long distance buses the bus station is outside the city centre, but most bus companies provide a free transfer there if you have a ticket. Passenger and freight trains run to Sivas via Amasya. The train station is in the city center. Freight trains are taken by ferry to railways at Kavkaz in Russia, and will later see service to the port of Varna in Bulgaria and Poti in Georgia. Modern trams run between the train station and Ondokuz Mayƒ±s University. There is a plan to run electrically powered bus rapid transit between the railway station and Tekkekoy. City buses carry passengers actively. Dolmu≈ü, the routes are numbered 1 to 4 and each route has different color minibuses. The long Samsun Amisos Hill Gondola serves from Batƒ±park the archaeological area on the Amisos Hill, where ancient tombs in tumuli were discovered. Samsun-√áar≈üamba Airport is east of the city center. It is possible to reach the airport by Havas service buses: they depart from the coach park close to Kultur Sarayi in the city center. Horse-drawn carriages, (Turkish:fayton) run along the seafront. There was automated bike rental along the seafront, but it is not currently operational. Economy Hospital of Ondokuz Mayƒ±s University's Faculty of Medicine in Samsun. Samsun has a mixed economy with a cluster of medical industries. Ports and shipbuilding Former Ottoman Bank branch in Samsun. Samsun is a port city. In the early 20th century, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey funded the building of a harbor. Before the building of the harbor, ships had to anchor to deliver goods, approximately 1 mile or more from shore. Trade and transportation was focused around a road to and from Sivas. The privately operated port fronting the city centre handles freight, including RORO ferries to Novorossiysk, whereas fishing boats land their catches in a separate harbour slightly further east. A ship building yard is under construction at the eastern city limit. Road and rail freight connections with central Anatolia can be used to send inland both the agricultural produce of the surrounding well rained upon and fertile land, and also imports from overseas. =Coal imports from Donbass= Donbass anthracite, imported via the Russian ports of Azov and Taganrog, is said to be illegally exported Ukrainian coal. In 2019 some crew were rescued but 6 died after a ship sank in the Black Sea. Manufacturing and food processing There is a light industrial zone between the city and the airport. The main manufactured products are medical devices and products, furniture (wood is imported across the Black Sea), tobacco products (although tobacco farming is now limited by the government), chemicals and automobile spare parts. Flour mills import wheat from Ukraine and export some of the flour. Local government and services Provincial government and services (e.g. courts, prisons and hospitals) support the surrounding region. Agricultural research establishments support provincial agriculture and food processing. Shopping Samsun Piazza Mall exterior Samsun Bulvar Shopping Mall Samsun Piazza Mall Most of the many new shopping malls are purpose built, but the former tobacco factory in the city center has been converted into a mall. Culture The Atat√ºrk Culture Center Atat√ºrk K√ºlt√ºr Sarayƒ± (AKM ‚Äì Palace of Culture). Concerts and other performances are held at the Kultur Sarayi, which is shaped much like a ski jump. \\"Samsun State Opera and Ballet\\" performs in The Atat√ºrk Culture Center.

Sports Samsun 19 Mayƒ±s Stadium In ancient Roman times gladiator sword fighting apparently took place in Amisos, as depicted on a tombstone dating from the 2nd or 3rd century CE. Tekkek√∂y Ya≈üar Doƒüu Arena opened in 2013. Football is the most popular sport: in the older districts above the city center children often kick balls around in the evenings in the smallest streets. The city's football club is Samsunspor, which plays its games at the Samsun 19 Mayƒ±s Stadium. Basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, cable skiing (in summer), horse riding, go karting, paintballing, martial arts and many other sports are played.

HiperMAN is a European alternative to WiMAX (or the IEEE 802.16 standard) and the Korean technology WiBro. HiperMAN is aiming principally for providing broadband Wireless Internet access, while covering a large geographic area. The standardization focuses on broadband solutions optimized for access in frequency bands below 11 GHz (mainly in the 3.5 GHz band). HiperMAN is optimised for packet switched networks, and supports fixed and nomadic applications, primarily in the residential and small business user environments. HiperMAN will be an interoperable broadband fixed wireless access system operating at radio frequencies between 2 GHz and 11 GHz. The HiperMAN standard is designed for Fixed Wireless Access provisioning to SMEs and residences using the basic MAC (DLC and CLs) of the IEEE 802.16-2001 standard. It has been developed in very close cooperation with IEEE 802.16, such that the HiperMAN standard and a subset of the IEEE 802.16a-2003 standard will interoperate seamlessly. HiperMAN is capable of supporting ATM, though the main focus is on IP traffic. It offers various service categories, full Quality of Service, fast connection control management, strong security, fast adaptation of coding, modulation and transmit power to propagation conditions and is capable of non-line-of-sight operation.

There are 80 chains to one mile. The station was opened as Emerson Park Halt in 1909 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on a branch line which had connected Romford with and since 1893. The station has been managed by London Overground since 2015, which also operates the train services. Emerson Park has no station buildings other than a canopy over the single platform. It has relatively low but fast- growing patronage for a suburban railway station, with approximately 350,000 passenger entries/exits in 2018/19, compared to 127,000 five years prior and just 59,000 ten years prior: a 600% increase over ten years. History The Romford to Upminster Line was constructed in 1893 as a branch of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR). Property development in the immediate area and in 1908 the proposed new railway station in nearby Gidea Park, which opened in 1910 on the Great Eastern Railway (GER), prompted the LTSR to construct a station on their branch. The station was opened on 1 October 1909 as Emerson Park Halt on the branch line from Romford to Grays via Upminster, where it connected with the main line from London Fenchurch Street.

However, the NX bit is being increasingly used in conventional von Neumann architecture processors for security reasons. An operating system with support for the NX bit may mark certain areas of memory as non-executable. The processor will then refuse to execute any code residing in these areas of memory. The general technique, known as executable space protection, also called Write XOR Execute, is used to prevent certain types of malicious software from taking over computers by inserting their code into another program's data storage area and running their own code from within this section; one class of such attacks is known as the buffer overflow attack. Intel markets the feature as the XD bit (execute disable). Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) uses the marketing term Enhanced Virus Protection (EVP). The ARM architecture refers to the feature, which was introduced in ARMv6, as XN (execute never). The term NX bit itself is sometimes used to describe similar technologies in other processors. Architecture support  x86  x86 processors, since the 80286, included a similar capability implemented at the segment level. However, almost all operating systems for the 80386 and later x86 processors implement the flat memory model, so they cannot use this capability. There was no 'Executable' flag in the page table entry (page descriptor) in those processors, until, to make this capability available to operating systems using the flat memory model, AMD added a \\"no-execute\\" or NX bit to the page table entry in its AMD64 architecture, providing a mechanism that can control execution per page rather than per whole segment. Intel implemented a similar feature in its Itanium (Merced) processor--having IA-64 architecture--in 2001, but did not bring it to the more popular x86 processor families (Pentium, Celeron, Xeon, etc.). In the x86 architecture it was first implemented by AMD, as the NX bit, for use by its AMD64 line of processors, such as the Athlon 64 and Opteron. After AMD's decision to include this functionality in its AMD64 instruction set, Intel implemented the similar XD bit feature in x86 processors beginning with the Pentium 4 processors based on later iterations of the Prescott core. The NX bit specifically refers to bit number 63 (i.e. the most significant bit) of a 64-bit entry in the page table. If this bit is set to 0, then code can be executed from that page; if set to 1, code cannot be executed from that page, and anything residing there is assumed to be data. It is only available with the long mode (64-bit mode) or legacy Physical Address Extension (PAE) page-table formats, but not x86's original 32-bit page table format because page table entries in that format lack the 63rd bit used to disable and enable execution. ARM In ARMv6, a new page table entry format was introduced; it includes an \\"execute never\\" bit. For ARMv8-A, VMSAv8-64 block and page descriptors, and VMSAv8-32 long- descriptor block and page descriptors, for stage 1 translations have \\"execute never\\" bits for both privileged and unprivileged modes, and block and page descriptors for stage 2 translations have a single \\"execute never\\" bit(two bits due to ARMv8.2-TTS2UXN feature); VMSAv8-32 short-descriptor translation table descriptors at level 1 have \\"execute never\\" bits for both privileged and unprivileged mode and at level 2 have a single \\"execute never\\" bit. Alpha As of the Fourth Edition of the Alpha Architecture manual, DEC (now HP) Alpha has a Fault on Execute bit in page table entries with the OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and Alpha Linux PALcode. SPARC The SPARC Reference MMU for Sun SPARC version 8 has permission values of Read Only, Read/Write, Read/Execute, and Read/Write/Execute in page table entries, although not all SPARC processors have a SPARC Reference MMU. A SPARC version 9 MMU may provide, but is not required to provide, any combination of read/write/execute permissions. A Translation Table Entry in a Translation Storage Buffer in Oracle SPARC Architecture 2011, Draft D1.0.0 has separate Executable and Writable bits. PowerPC/Power ISA Page table entries for IBM PowerPC's hashed page tables have a no-execute page bit. Page table entries for radix- tree page tables in the Power ISA have separate permission bits granting read/write and execute access. PA-RISC Translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries and page table entries in PA-RISC 1.1 and PA-RISC 2.0 support read-only, read/write, read/execute, and read/write/execute pages. Itanium TLB entries in Itanium support read-only, read/write, read/execute, and read/write/execute pages. z/Architecture As of the twelfth edition of the z/Architecture Principles of Operation, z/Architecture processors may support the Instruction-Execution Protection facility, which adds a bit in page table entries that controls whether instructions from a given region, segment, or page can be executed.

He was the count of Metz and Ch√¢tenois from 1047 to 1048, when his brother Duke Adalbert resigned them to him upon his becoming the Duke of Upper Lorraine. On Adalbert's death the next year, G√©rard became duke, a position that he held until his death. In contemporary documents, he is called G√©rard of Alsace (after the fact that he had some land in Alsace), G√©rard of Chatenoy (after an ancestral castle near Neufch√¢teau), or G√©rard of Flanders (after his wife's homeland). He was the second son of G√©rard de Bouzonville, count of Metz, and Gisela who was possibly a daughter of Theodoric I, Duke of Upper Lorraine. Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, invested Adalbert with Lorraine in 1047 after confiscating it from Godfrey III. Godfrey did not back down, however, and killed Adalbert in battle. Henry subsequently bestowed it on G√©rard, but the deposed duke continued to stir. Godfrey had the support of a faction of the nobles who did not want a strong hand at the ducal helm and G√©rard was imprisoned. G√©rard, however, had the support of the chiefest of his bishops, that of Toul, Bruno of Eguisheim-Dagsburg (later the sainted Pope Leo IX), who procured his liberation in 1049. The emperor gave him troops to assist him in his fight, for the rebels had the support of some elements in the church. G√©rard himself remained, as his brother had, faithful to the end to the imperial dynasty and his descendants would remain so as well even into the Hohenstaufen years. His alliance with the church was regular but inconstant and he afforded his protection to Moyenmoutier Abbey, Saint-Mihiel Abbey, and Remiremont Abbey. The former was the abbey of Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida, who excommunicated the patriarch of Constantinople, Michael I Cerularius, in 1054, thus precipitating the Great Schism, and the latter was his own final resting place. On 18 June 1053, G√©rard and Prince Rudolf of Benevento led papal and Swabian troops into battle on behalf of Pope Leo. This was the Battle of Civitate and it was a disastrous loss for the pope. His enemy, the Normans, under Humphrey of Hauteville and Richard of Aversa, defeated his allies and captured his person, taking him prisoner in Benevento. Gerard, however, returned to Lorraine. Among his other construction projects, was that of the castle of Pr√©ny, in the centre of the duchy, the beginnings of the capital city, Nancy. He died at Remiremont while trying to kill a revolt. Poisoning was suspected. The date of his death is either 14 April or 11 August. He was married to Hedwige of Namur (or of Flanders), daughter of Albert II, Count of Namur, and Regelindis of Lower-Lorraine, daughter of Gothelo I, Duke of Lorraine. This marriage helped patch up relations with the baronage. They had the following issue: *Theodoric II, Duke of Lorraine (c.1055-1115), successor in Lorraine *Gerard (1057‚Äì1108), count of Vaud√©mont *Beatrice, married Stephen I, Count of Burgundy, M√¢con, and Vienne *Gisela, abbess of Remiremont He was the patrilineal ancestor of the line of dukes which ruled Lorraine until 1737 and of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty that ruled Tuscany (1737‚Äì1859), the Holy Roman Empire (1745‚Äì1807), Austria-Hungary (1780‚Äì1918), the Duchy of Parma (1814‚Äì1847), Duchy of Modena (1815‚Äì1859), and Mexico (1864‚Äì1867).

He was the son and successor of Gerhard and Hedwige of Namur. He is sometimes numbered Theodoric I if the Dukes of the House of Ardennes, who ruled in Upper Lorraine from 959 to 1033, are ignored in favour of the dukes of Lower Lorraine as predecessors of the later Dukes of Lorraine. In fact, Sophia, the daughter of Duke Frederick II of the House of Ardennes, who had inherited the counties of Bar and Montb√©liard, had a husband named Louis, who contested the succession. In order to receive the support of his brother, Theodoric gave his brother the County of Vaud√©mont and convened an assembly of nobles, who elected him duke over Louis. Soon Louis was dead, but his son, Theodoric II of Bar, claimed the succession anyway. However, Emperor Henry IV confirmed Theodoric the Valiant in the duchy. Probably, for this reason, Theodoric remained faithful to the emperors throughout his rule. He fought the Saxons while they were at war with the Emperor between 1070 and 1078 and he generally opposed the popes Gregory VII and Urban II when they were in conflict with the Emperor. In 1095, he planned to take up the Cross (i.e., go on Crusade, specifically the First), but his ill health provoked him to drop out, nevertheless convincing his barons to go east. Thereafter, he took little part in imperial affairs, preferring not to intervene between Henry IV and his son Henry, or against Lothair of Supplinburg, duke of Saxony.

Theobald hoped to get his hands on the county of Metz, but failing that, he repudiated Gertrude. Gertrude had no children by a third marriage and Nancy reverted to the duchy on her death in 1225.

Frederick's father-in- law was the Count of Champagne as well, and the marriage of Margaret with Frederick signified the Gallicization of Lorraine and the beginnings of tension between French and German influences which characterises its later history. When Joan I of Navarre, Margaret's niece, (the daughter of her brother, Henry I of Navarre), married Philip the Fair, the future king of France, in 1284, the ties to France grew. The long-held loyalty of the dukes of Lorraine to the Holy Roman Emperor had waned in the first half of the thirteenth century and French influence was pervasive, leading to its permanent attachment to France in 1766. During Frederick's reign, he fought the bishops of Metz until Pope Clement IV excommunicated him and put his duchy under an interdict. In 1257, after the elections following the death of King William of Holland resulted in the contested election of both Richard, Earl of Cornwall and Alfonso X of Castile, Frederick of Lorraine sided with Alfonso, who through his mother Beatrix was the grandson of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. The rivalry between the two kings led to little actual combat and after Richard's death the 1273 election of Rudolf of Habsburg and the subsequent withdrawal of Alfonso reestablished unity.

Life In 1298, he took part in the Battle of G√∂llheim, near Speyer, in which the king of Germany, Adolph, was killed fighting his rival, Albert of Habsburg. Theobald was on Albert' side, despite the history of support for the legitimate emperors (which Adolph aspired to be) in the history of his family. In 1302, Theobald and his son, Frederick, were supporting Philip IV of France, at the Battle of the Golden Spurs at Kortrijk, where the Flemings defeated the French chivalry under Robert II of Artois. He was present also at the Battle of Mons- en-P√©v√®le in 1304, where the French king personally led the army in a less decisive battle. He, along with John II, Duke of Brabant, and Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, were sent to negotiate peace with Flanders. In 1305, he was at Lyon, at the crowning of Pope Clement V.

Biography Frederick was born in Gondreville, the son and successor of Theobald II and Isabella of Rumigny. On 18 October 1314, at the Diet of Frankfurt, the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire failed to elect as successor to Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, either the Habsburg claimant, Frederick the Handsome, the duke of Austria, or the Wittelsbach, Louis IV of Bavaria. By marriage to Elisabeth, daughter of Albert I of Germany, Frederick was the brother-in-law of Frederick the Handsome, called Frederick III of Germany by his supporters, of whom Frederick of Lorraine was one. On 28 September 1322, at the Battle of M√ºhldorf, both Fredericks were captured. This was an opportunity for Charles IV of France to strengthen the Lorrainer ties to France and he quickly procured the duke's release on the promise that Lorraine would not interfere in imperial affairs. In 1324, he participated in an expedition in Aquitaine against Edward II of England's estates, for Charles IV had built a fortress illegally on Edward's territory and had sent his uncle, Count Charles III of Valois, against the English possessions after Hugh le Despenser and the Younger Despenser imprisoned Isabella of France, Charles IV's sister and Edward's queen. He took part in the War of Metz in 1325 and 1326. He joined Philip VI of France, on his succession in 1328, and fought and died at the Battle of Cassel.

Though he was but nine years of age when his father died and he succeeded to the duchy under the regency of his mother (until 1334), he was a warrior prince, taking part in four separate wars in Lorraine, France, Brittany, and Iberia. He was killed at the Battle of Cr√©cy. In 1337, Count Henry IV of Bar refused to do homage for a few seignories he held of the duke. Rudolph was forced to devastate Pont-√†- Mousson and its environs. In a series of reprisals, Henry ravaged the west of Lorraine and Rudolph attacked the Barrois. Only by the intervention of Philip VI of France was the war ended. By that time, the ties of Lorraine to France had become very strong. They were to become stronger under the half-Habsburg Rudolph. His second marriage was to the daughter of a French lord, Guy I of Blois, and niece of the king of France. He also assisted Philip with troops to lift Edward III of England's Siege of Tournai (1340) in the opening phase of the Hundred Years' War. During a brief Anglo-French peace, he journeyed to the Iberian Peninsula to aid Alfonso XI of Castile in the Reconquista. He battled the Moors of Granada and shone in the Battle of Gibraltar on 3 November 1340. On his return to France, he came to the aid of his French brother-in-law, Charles of Blois, in the War of the Breton Succession.

As an infant of six months, he succeeded his father, Rudolph, who was killed in the Battle of Cr√©cy. His mother was Mary, daughter of Guy I of Blois. During his long minority, the regency was in the hands of his mother and Eberhard III of W√ºrttemberg. In December 1353, John did homage for the duchy to Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who made him lieutenant-general of the Empire in the Moselle country. In 1354, John II of France granted him a dispensation to allow him to govern the duchy despite not yet being of age. John participated in the Drang nach Osten and its related crusades at the sides of the Teutonic Knights against Lithuania in 1356 and again in 1365. On 19 September 1356, he aided John II of France in the Battle of Poitiers, as his father had at Cr√©cy, and the French cavalry were mowed down by English longbowmen as before. He survived, however, unlike his father, to fight again, although he was taken prisoner by the English. He later fought on the side of the Dauphin Charles in putting down the Parisian rebellion of √âtienne Marcel. He attended Charles' coronation on 19 May 1364 in Rheims, strengthening the ties to France which had steadily been building in Lorraine for the past century. He entered the War of the Breton Succession, as had his father, to aid his uncle Charles of Blois against John of Montfort. At the Battle of Auray on 29 September 1364 with John as undisputed duke and Charles dead on the field, John was taken prisoner. He continued to aid Charles V and Charles VI to reconquer the provinces lost by the Treaty of Br√©tigny, but in his latter years, he distanced himself from the French court. Partly this was due to the free companies ravaging his lands and in part the royal officials who tried to litigate the relationship between John (an Imperial vassal) and his vassals. In the end, he entered into rapprochement with Philip II, Duke of Burgundy. Nonetheless, he died at Paris on 22 September 1390, defending himself against a charge by the people of Neufch√¢teau of abuse of power.

Life Isabella was the eldest daughter of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine and Margaret of the Palatinate. By the death of her brothers, it was made apparent in 1410 that she would be the successor of her father in Lorraine. She was given a careful education, and described as beautiful, witty, brave and with the ability to be careful and make hard decisions in difficult circumstances. On 24 October 1420, she married Ren√© of Anjou. In the marriage contract, it was specified that she would inherit Lorraine, as he would inherit Bar and Pont-√†- Mousson, and that their child and heir would inherit all their domains, thereby uniting them. On 25 January 1431, Isabella inherited the duchy from her father upon his death, and ruled jointly with her husband as her co-ruler, as was customary for a female monarch at that time. Her right to rule was questioned by her cousin, count Antoine de Vaud√©mont, who captured Rene in the Battle of Bulgn√©ville and had him imprisoned with his ally, the Duke of Burgundy. She led an army to rescue her husband from Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. She managed to secure a ceasefire, and the Emperor recognized her right to rule 24 April 1434. On November 1434, her imprisoned spouse inherited the domains of Anjou, Provence and Maine from his brother as well as the position of heir to the throne of Naples, and on 2 February 1435, her inherited the throne of Naples. Rene appointed her to act as his general governor until his release, and a Napolese embassy asked her to come to Naples to assume the post of regent until her spouse could do so in person. She left with her son Louis and a fleet. The mid-16th century Chronicle of Gaspare Fuscolillo records that Isabella arrived in Naples on 15 October 1435. As regent of Naples, was to face the struggle with the other competitor to the throne of Naples, Alfonso of Aragon. She was given military support from the pope, but could not cooperate well with its commander, Jacopo Caldora. Rene was released in 1437, and arrived in Naples to take over the rule from Isabella in May 1438. Isabella left with Louis to return to Lorraine in August 1440. In Lorraine, she finally defeated Antoine de Vaud√©mont 27 March 1441. When Charles VII of France visited in Nancy, they introduced Agnes Sorel to him, who was one of Isabella's ladies-in-waiting. She soon afterwards became the king's influential mistress. In July 1445, Isabella appointed her son John to be her governor general in Lorraine, and retired to her manor Launay in Saumur. Isabella died on 28 February 1453 at the age of 53. Her son John succeeded her as Duke of Lorraine. She was buried in Angers Cathedral.

Raised at the French court, Antoine would campaign in Italy twice, once under Louis XII and the other with Francis I. During the German Peasants' War, he would defeat two armies while retaking Saverne and S√©lestat. Antoine succeeded in freeing Lorraine from the Holy Roman Empire with the Treaty of Nuremberg of 1542. In 1544, while Antoine suffered from an illness, the Duchy of Lorraine was invaded by Emperor Charles V's army on their way to attack France. Fleeing the Imperial armies, Antoine was taken to Bar-le-Duc where he died. Biography Antoine was born, 4 June 1489, at Bar-le-Duc, the son of Ren√© II, Duke of Lorraine and Philippa of Guelders. He spent seven years at the court of King Louis XII together with his brother Claude, and became friends with the Duke of Angoul√™me, the future King Francis I. After the death of his father, Rene II, Antoine succeeded him as duke of Lorraine in December 1508. In 1530, a transaction between Antoine and his brother, Claude, divided the family possessions, with Antoine getting the duchies of Lorraine and Bar while Claude would receive the duchy of Guise. In 1509 he entrusted the reins of the Duchy to his mother and Hugues des Hazards, bishop of Toul, and followed Louis XII in his campaign in northern Italy, where he took part in the Battle of Agnadello of that year. After Louis' death, he went back to Italy and under Francis I, participating in the battle of Marignano (13-14 September 1515). However, called back home by problems in Lorraine, he was absent at the decisive battle of Pavia (1525), in which Francis was taken prisoner and his brother Fran√ßois, count of Lambesc, was killed. Peasant war In Lorraine, Antoine had to face the spreading of Protestant Reformation, against which he published an edict on 26 December 1523. The situation worsened the following year, when a rebellion, known as German Peasants' War, broke out in Alsace. The insurrectionists captured Saverne and tried to conquer Saint-Di√©, while the peasants of Bitscherland also rebelled in May 1525. Antoine launched an expedition in which he massacred a peasant army at Saverne on 16 May and on 20 May he decisively defeated another peasant army near S√©lestat. Duchy legal status Despite remaining neutral in the wars between France and the Holy Roman Empire, Antoine sent his son Francis to the French court and by 1527 was attempting to marry him to Anne of Cleves. In an effort to improve his relations with German lords, Antoine sent a few hundred soldiers to fight against the Ottomans at the Siege of Vienna in 1529. Antoine dispatched legal envoys to the Imperial diet, in 1532, seeking clarification of the duchy of Lorraine's legal status within the Holy Roman Empire to no avail. In 1538, Antoine claimed the titles of Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen upon the death of Charles of Egmond, but was unable to gain possession of them. He married his heir, Francis to Christina of Denmark, niece of Charles V, in 1541, and with the Treaty of Nuremberg (26 August 1542), Antoine obtained from Charles V the independence of the Duchy of Lorraine. He interceded at the start of Francis and Charles' war in 1542 as a peace envoy, visiting Charles in person, but due to gout sent his heir to Francis. In fact, Antoine asked his niece, Mary of Guise, to send him a Scottish hackney horse which he hoped would be easier to ride with his gout. Death and aftermath In May 1544, Charles V's army marched into Lorraine as part of a plan to invade France, while Henry VIII of England attacked northern France from Calais. Weakened by an illness, Antoine was unable to respond, and was taken to Bar-le-Duc where he died on 14 June 1544. Antoine's oldest son Francis succeeded him as Duke of Lorraine and ruled for only one year, dying in 1545. His son, Antoine's grandson, Charles III of Lorraine became duke with his mother, Christina of Denmark, as regent. By 1552, King Henry II of France visited Charles and it was decided that Charles would be educated at the French court and that the regency of Lorraine would fall to his uncle, Nicolas, Duke of Merc≈ìur. In 1559, the House of Guise, fearing the influence of the Holy Roman Empire over Lorraine, orchestrated Charles's marriage to Claude of France, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici.

Charles was the elder son of John I, Duke of Lorraine, and Sophie, daughter of Eberhard II, Count of W√ºrttemberg. He is called Charles II because of a previous Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, despite the fact that his own duchy was that of Upper Lorraine; Lower Lorraine being subsumed in Brabant by his time. During his youth, he had been close to Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, and they were comrades in arms on several occasions. This proximity to Burgundy was largely a result of his father's moving away from the French court, the court to which the Lorrainer dukes had neared in the past century and a half as they withdrew from the Holy Roman Empire, within which their duchy was still technically a vassal state. Charles was defiant of Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, who had supported the citizens of Neufch√¢teau against his father and the Emperor Wenceslaus when the latter was accused by his subjects of weakness. Wenceslaus was deposed in 1400 and replaced by Rupert III, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Charles' father-in-law. Charles was also a major participant in some late Crusading movements. He was at Tunis in 1391. He took part in the so-called Last Crusade which culminated in the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. There he accompanied John the Fearless, the count of Nevers and son of his friend Philip. In 1399, he assisted the Teutonic Knights in Livonia. Multiple times between 1405 and 1406, the sergeants of the duke and the officers of the kings of France in certain enclaves (French fiefs) in Lorraine were at loggerheads and Louis of Orl√©ans, who had received the pledges of the duke of Luxembourg, was trying to create a principality in the region. Then, in 1407, at the head of a coalition of the dukes of Bar, Luxembourg, and the margraves of Namur he attacked the duchy. Louis was defeated at Corny-sur-Moselle and then, in July, at Champigneulles. His assassination in Paris on 23 November put an end to his plans. With the assassination of Louis, France broke down into two parties: the Armagnacs of Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, the tutor of the young Charles of Orl√©ans, and the Burgundians of John the Fearless, Philip's successor, who supported Charles of Lorraine. Charles did not, however, enter the Anglo-French conflict then raging--the Hundred Years' War--but his brother, Frederick I, Count of Vaud√©mont, got involved and died in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Nevertheless, the queen, Isabeau of Bavaria, appointed Charles constable in 1418. In 1424, he asserted that the load was too large for him and renounced it. Charles adopted a new stance vis-√†-vis France after the assassination of John the Fearless in 1419. John's successor, Philip III, had much territory in the Low Countries and only Lorraine and Champagne separated his Burgundian from his Belgian possessions. Fearing any warlike ambitions, Charles thought it prudent to reorient his fidelities and friendships away from such a possible adversary. Through his French connections, he obtained the assistance of Charles VII against Burgundy and married his daughter to the Angevin Ren√©, later king of Naples. Charles's final years were rife with conflict and unhappiness. His nephew, Anthony of Vaud√©mont demanded a part of the inheritance and Charles had to war against him in 1425, without much success. Early in 1429, Joan of Arc came on a pilgrimage to Saint-Nicolas-de-Port. She counselled the duke to abandon his mistress, Alison du May. Ignoring this advice, he gave her an escort and sent her on to Chinon. He died two years later at his capital of Nancy on 21 or 25 January.

History and Family He was the son of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, and Claude of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. His paternal grandparents were Francis I, Duke of Lorraine, and Christina of Denmark. He married, firstly, Catherine de Bourbon, Duchess of Albret, daughter Antoine of Navarre and Jeanne d'Albret, sister of King Henry IV of France. The couple were married at the Ch√¢teau de Saint Germain-en-Laye outside Paris on 31 January 1599. The bride was already 39 years of age and the union was merely to secure relations with the House of Bourbon which had previously been rivals with the House of Lorraine. As Catherine was a Protestant and Henry was a Catholic, a papal dispensation was needed for the two to marry. Pope Clement VIII refused to grant a dispensation, but Catherine's brother, Henry, convinced their illegitimate half-brother, Charles, Archbishop of Rouen, to officiate at the wedding. Catherine died childless in 1604, aged 45. With no issue from that union, Duke Henri married, secondly, Margherita Gonzaga on 24 April 1606 in Mantua.

He was Duke of Lorraine briefly in 1625, quickly abdicating in favour of his son. Biography The youngest son of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, and his wife Claude of France, he was styled the Count of Vaud√©mont during his father's reign (1545‚Äì1608) as well as during that of his older brother Henry II (1608‚Äì1624). His father appointed him as his deputy (Lieutenant General) of Lorraine, while in 1594 he was out of the country. That same year he was Lieutenant General of the French king in Toul and Verdun. From September to October 1606 he was in his father's diplomatic mission in England. In 1621 he fell out with his brother Henry II, who had become duke in 1608, and went to Germany for the emperor to fight the Protestants. The reason for the rift was Henry's intention to have Francis's son Charles marry Henry II's daughter Nicolette of Lorraine and to leave Lorraine to her, even though the will of Duke Ren√© II had provided for a strictly male succession. Henry and his wife Margherita Gonzaga had only had daughters. After negotiations, the issue was then resolved and the marriage took place but the couple did not have any children and the duchy was to revert to Francis' other son, the future Nicholas II, Duke of Lorraine.

After Francis' brother died on 31 July 1624, the situation became complicated; Henry's final rules specified that Charles could only be the Duke of Lorraine as Nicolette's husband. In November 1625, however, it was Francis himself who became the ruler of Lorraine. Having claimed the duchy for himself, he got it on 21 November 1625 from the duchy's States General. After he had paid the duchy's debt out of its treasury five days later, he abdicated in favour of his son, who by then had pushed aside his wife and who then ruled in his own right. In his will, Francis stated that he \\"never had ambitions to wear a crown in this world\\". After his abdication, Francis II took on the management of the county of Vaud√©mont.

He was therefore Duke during the invasion of Lorraine by the French in the Thirty Years War. He is the direct male ancestor of all rulers of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, including all Emperors of Austria. Biography Nicholas Francis was the youngest son of Duke Francis II of Lorraine and his wife, Christina of Salm. Born on the feast of Saint Nicholas, he was named in his honour. His sister was Marguerite of Lorraine, the Duchess of Orl√©ans and wife of Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans. As it appeared unlikely that he would succeed to the duchy, he was destined for the church. He was made coadjutor bishop of Toul, in spite of his youth, in 1619 and succeeded to the see in 1624, but never actually received any sacred orders. He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Pont-√†- Mousson, 1622‚Äì1629. He returned to Nancy in June 1629. The thesis he prepared on the sacrament of penance was printed in Holland in 1627 with a dedication to Pope Urban VIII. After his promotion to the cardinalate, he received private lessons from two Jesuit priests. Nicholas Francis was named abbot in commendam ‚Äì a lucrative sinecure ‚Äì of several abbeys and was sent on several embassies by his brother, Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, and by Louis XIII of France. On 19 January 1626 he was created cardinal in pectore (secretly). The appointment was not proclaimed publicly until 30 August 1627. He never received the cardinal's red hat nor was he assigned a cardinal-deaconry. When in 1634 his brother Charles was pressured into resigning in his favor, he became sovereign Duke of Lorraine. He wrote to Pope Urban VIII, 4 March 1634, resigning as cardinal to marry his cousin Claude of Lorraine, the second daughter of Henry II, on 17‚Äì18 February. On 8 March 1634, the pope declared him in nullo e sacris ordinis constitutum, depriving him of the title of cardinal and the diocese of Toul. In the consistory of 22 March 1634, the pope communicated this to the College of Cardinals. Immediately following Nicholas's accession to the dukedom, the French invaded the duchy and forced the new duke to sign a treaty recognizing their right to occupy it. In April 1634, Nicholas himself fled into exile, and soon after abdicated himself, returning the claim to the duchy to his older brother, Charles. With one brief exception, Charles would not, however, be able to return to his duchy until 1661.

Life He came to lose his duchy because of his notionally anti-French policy; in 1633, French troops invaded Lorraine in retaliation for Charles's support of Gaston d'Orl√©ans‚Äîwho repeatedly plotted against Richelieu's governance of France under the childless Louis XIII and treated dangerously with its enemies as a young heir presumptive‚Äîand Richelieu's policies were always anti-Habsburg so as to increase the strength and prestige of France at the expense of the two dynasties. Gaston d'Orl√©ans, frequently sided with either branch of the Habsburg family against Richelieu, who was de facto ruler of France as its Chief Minister, and had to flee several times to avoid charges and trial for treason. His allies and confederates generally bore the price of these escapades by the young and impetuous heir and Charles IV was one such. On one visit to the ducal court at Nancy, the widowed Gaston fell in love with Charles's 15-year-old sister and married her secretly, which so infuriated the king that he convened the clergy of France and the Parlement of Paris to void the marriage, giving consent only on his death bed. B√©atrix de Cusance In that circumstance and sense, Charles was a casualty of the fierce factional infighting in the French court between the King's brother Gaston d'Orl√©ans, and Cardinal Richelieu, even though technically, Lorraine was subject to the Holy Roman Empire and the Emperor Ferdinand II of Austria. Forced to make humiliating concessions to France, he abdicated under the French pressure and invasion in 1634 in favor of his brother, Nicholas Francis, and entered the imperial service in the Thirty Years' War and was victorious at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen. Shortly thereafter, Nicholas Francis too fled into exile and abdicated his claims, which were now taken up once again by Charles, who remained Duke of Lorraine in exile for the next quarter century. In 1651 Charles IV was approached by an Irish delegation who were seeking his support to defend Ireland from the invasion of the Parliamentarian army of England. Traditional accounts of the Cromwellian wars often dismiss the appeal to Lorraine as an act of desperation, but recently one historian has argued that the stateless Duke was in fact seriously interested in becoming the Protector of Ireland.O Siochru, Micheal God's Executioner, p. 162 In the summer of 1652, a number of ships sent by Charles arrived at Inishbofin island with supplies, one of the last strongholds of the Irish. Unfortunately Charles faced great opposition by the Irish Leaders Clanricarde and Ormonde, both of whom were arch-royalists loyal to Charles II of England. Lorraine eventually concluded that Ireland had been destroyed by the jealousy of those who desired the loss of it, than they should be obliged for its recovery to the protection of his said Highness. In 1661, the French withdrew from Lorraine, and Charles was able to return to the Duchy for the first time. In 1670, the duchy was again occupied by the French under King Louis XIV. Charles served in the Imperial armies in both the Thirty Years' War and the Franco-Dutch War (1672‚Äì1678), both of which secured French dominance on the Continent. In 1675 he defeated Fran√ßois de Cr√©quy at Konzer Brucke, and died the same year in Austrian service. The duchy was not restored to his family until more than twenty years later. He is sometimes numbered as Charles III of Lorraine. Issue Charles Henri. Charles married first Nicolette of Lorraine, whom he deposed and replaced as monarch of Lorraine in 1625. They had no children and Charles abandoned her. On 2 April 1637, he married B√©atrice de Cusance, Princess de Cantecroix (1614-1663), daughter and heiress of Claude-Fran√ßois de Cusance, Baron de Belvoir (1590-1633) and of Ernestine de Witthem, Countess van Walhain, who had become the widow of Eugene Perrenot de Granvelle dit d'Oiselet, Prince de Cantecroix earlier that year; and had three children; *Francis de Lorraine (1637 ‚Ä† 1638); *Anne de Lorraine (1639 ‚Ä† 1720), married her cousin Fran√ßois Marie de Lorraine (1624 ‚Ä† 1694), Prince de Lillebonne in 1660, had issue; *Charles Henri de Lorraine (1649 ‚Ä† 1723), Prince of Vaud√©mont and of Commercy. His marriage to B√©atrice de Cusance was not deemed valid by the Roman Catholic church, which had not authorised his divorce from Nicole. The couple separated in April 1642 following his excommunication, which was the consequence of his second marriage; it was also the month in which she bore a son whom Charles recognised. More than 20 years later, on 20 May 1663, Charles married B√©atrice de Cusance a second time, to allow legitimation of their children. She died two weeks after this second marriage. Charles married a fourth time at the age of 61. The bride was Marie-Louise d'Aspremont (1652-1692), the 18-year-old daughter of Charles d'Aspremont-Lynden, Count of Rekem and of Marie Fran√ßoise de Mailly. They had no children and in 1679, a widow, she married Count Heinrich Franz von Mansfeld, Prince di Fondi, by whom she had two daughters.

He is the direct male ancestor of all rulers of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, including all Emperors of Austria. Early life Leopold Joseph Charles Dominique Agapet Hyacinthe was the son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and his wife Eleonora Maria Josefa of Austria, a half-sister of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. At the time of Leopold's birth, Lorraine and Bar had been occupied by Louis XIV of France, forcing his parents to move into exile to Austria, where they lived under the protection of the Emperor. Therefore, Leopold was born in the palace of Innsbruck and received his first name in honour of the Emperor. Leopold grew up in Innsbruck, while his father would be engaged in defending Vienna against the Turks. In 1690, his father died and eleven-year-old Leopold inherited the still occupied Duchies. His mother, trying to fulfil her husband's last wishes of returning her children to their patrimony, appealed to the Reichstag in Regensburg to restore her son to Lorraine. Leopold was sent to Vienna to receive a military education under the supervision of the Emperor. In Vienna, he grew up with his cousins, the Archdukes Joseph and Charles, both future Emperors. Leopold was also created a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece that year. Like his father before him, he entered the Imperial Army and, aged eighteen, took part in the Siege of Timi»ôoara in 1694. Three years later, he received the command of the Army of the Rhine. Duke of Lorraine On 30 October 1697, the Nine Years' War (aka, War of the League of Augsburg) ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick. The treaty restored the duchies of Lorraine and Bar to the House of Lorraine, as Leopold's mother had hoped; she died four days later in Vienna. On 17 August 1698, Duke Leopold made a triumphant entry into his capital Nancy. He reconstructed and repopulated his war-stricken duchy, encouraging immigration. At the end of his reign the duchy was safe and prosperous. Leopold's wife, √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans. In his foreign policy, Leopold tried to further good relations with France and to appease his powerful neighbor. On 13 October 1698 at the Palace of Fontainebleau, Leopold married √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans, the niece of Louis XIV, who had offered a dowry of 900,000 livres to the penniless Duke. Elisabeth Charlotte turned out to be a caring mother and gave birth to fifteen children, of whom five survived into adulthood. Three of them died within a week in May 1711 due to a smallpox outbreak at the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville, the country seat of the dukes of Lorraine. Despite Leopold's diplomatic attempts, his capital, Nancy, was occupied by foreign troops during the War of the Spanish Succession (1700‚Äì1713). Fearing for his family, Leopold relocated the court to the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville, where Leopold rebuilt the castle as the \\"Versailles of Lorraine\\". It was here that his first child Leopold was born in 1700. In 1703, the Duke introduced the Code L√©opold regulating the government of the Duchy. A number of crimes were punishable with death by burning, such as witchcraft, coin forgery, arson, and sexual acts \\"contrary to nature\\". Also, those guilty of aggravated theft of sacred objects from a church could be condemned to be burnt alive. He tried to install his eldest daughter, Elisabeth Charlotte, as Abbess of Remiremont but failed due to the opposition of Pope Clement XI. Leopold's marital life was troubled in 1706, when he took Anne-Marguerite de Lign√©ville, Princess of Beauvau-Craon as his mistress, and enriched her family. Elisabeth Charlotte however, following her mother's advice, remained silent. In 1708, Leopold had claimed the Duchy of Montferrat as the closest relative of his cousin, Charles III Gonzaga, erstwhile Duke of Mantua, who had been deposed and then died without male issue. However, the Emperor had already promised Montferrat to the Dukes of Savoy but wishing to compensate the House of Lorraine, he gave the Duchy of Teschen in Silesia to Leopold. In 1710, Leopold and his wife visited Paris to attend the marriage of Elisabeth Charlotte's niece Marie Louise Elisabeth to the Duke of Berry, and were among the guests of the lavish banquet at the Palais du Luxembourg.Marie Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans During the visit, Leopold, as a foreign prince, received the style of Royal Highness. In 1719, Leopold bought the County of Ligny-en- Barrois from his cousin, Charles Henry of Vaudemont. During his reign a new security system was put in place all around Lorraine. He tried to abolish serfdom but the redemption payments were too high for the peasantry, even when Leopold halved it. On New Year's Eve 1719 he freed his own serfs without redemption, hoping in vain the nobility would follow his example.The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 210 Coin from the reign of L√©opold, 1720. The reverse of the coin, 1720 In 1721, Leopold arranged for his son and heir, Leopold Clement, to receive an education at Vienna. He also intended to forge relations with Archduchess Maria Theresa, the heiress of Emperor Charles VI. However, Leopold Clement died shortly afterwards at Lun√©ville and in his stead, the younger son Francis Stephen went to Vienna, where he married Maria Theresa. Francis would become Emperor and his descendants, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, would rule Austria until 1918. In 1725, Leopold tried to marry off his daughter Anne Charlotte to the young King Louis XV, but Louis Henry, Duke of Bourbon, then prime minister, prevented a union with a descendant of the rival House of Orl√©ans. Then, Elisabeth Charlotte tried to arrange her daughter's marriage to her first cousin, the recently widowed Louis, Duke of Orl√©ans, but Louis refused. All proposals of marriage being either ignored or declined, Anne Charlotte later became Abbess of the monasteries Remiremont and Essen. In March 1729, Leopold caught a fever while walking at the Ch√¢teau at M√©nil near Lun√©ville. He returned to Lun√©ville where he died on 27 March, aged 49.

This was commonly done in World War II to hide radios from the German occupiers. Concealment devices or diversion safes are used to hide things for the purpose of secrecy or security. They are made from an ordinary household object such as a book, a soda can, a candle, a can, or something as small as a coin. The idea is that such an inconspicuous object would not be expected to contain anything of worth. Examples in espionage include dead drop spikes for transferring items to other people, and hollowed- out coins or hollowed out teeth for concealing something - such as microfilm or a suicide pill. Examples in smuggling include suitcases with false bottoms for hiding contraband. During World War II MI9 was responsible for creating many concealment devices for \\"escape aids\\" to assist prisoners of war to escape. Examples Ammunition Starting in the First World War and still continuing today, military personnel use ammunition casings to hide small amounts of critical information e.g. encryption/recognition codes or navigational grid references etc. The hiding place is very easy to prepare: the bullet is removed from the cartridge and the propellant powder poured away. A small piece of paper with writing on it can be stored inside. Given that ammunition can be found everywhere in a combat zone, it is very easy to hide or discard such items because they blend in easily. Similarly, if a soldier is captured, the enemy expects that soldiers will have ammunition in their pockets, so little attention is paid, beyond confiscating and discarding it. Books Books are possibly the most common concealment devices in usage. They are easily made and can contain quite large objects. They are also very difficult for outsiders to spot but easy to recognize for those that are looking for a specific book on a shelf. Candles A new type, the hollow candle looks like a large scented candle but is mostly hollow. The bottom comes off and rolled papers or small objects can be placed and hidden inside. Some of the most clever of these contraptions looked like large, ordinary black candles with a felt base concealing the opening. To open them, two metal needles are poked through the felt at certain points and an electric current passed through, causing them to open.  Car  \\"Trap\\" is a colloquial term for a secret compartment in an automobile. It can be intended to hide legal items, such as handguns or valuables, from thieves. But it can also be used to hide contraband, such as illegal drugs, from searches by authorities. Until the 1980s, drugs trafficked in cars in the U.S. tended to be hidden in obvious places such as wheel wells or spare tires. In the early 1980s, the first magnetically or hydraulically actuated secret compartments, dubbed \\"urban traps\\" by the Drug Enforcement Administration, started to appear ‚Äì often in door panels, dashboards, seats and roofs. By the early 1990s, however, police had learned to detect such traps by looking for suspicious buttons and switches. More recent traps have no visible controls, are electronically controlled and may require complicated procedures for access. For example, one trap found in the airbag compartment of a U.S. car in 2012 would only open if a driver was in the seat, all doors were closed (to prevent the trap from opening during a roadside police search), the defroster was turned on and a magnetic card was swiped over a sensor hidden in an air-conditioning vent. The legality of traps is dependent on the jurisdiction in which they are used. In 2012, Alfred Anaya, famous among rich clients in California for his skill in installing sophisticated traps, was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison under U.S. federal law as a co-conspirator in a drug-trafficking operation. The conviction relied on testimony that Anaya had seen one of his clients stash some $800,000 in cash in a trap. The prosecution successfully argued that Anaya must have deduced from this that the trap was to be used for drug trafficking. Cans and jars Also a new form of concealment device, mock cans of various household chemicals or food and drinks can be purchased. A wide variety of commonly used personal care, household products and food containers with removable tops and bottoms are available. Valuables can be discreetly stored inside these lookalike containers and kept in their seemingly rightful places. Each of these diversion safes are indistinguishable from the genuine product, and can thus avoid detection, and they may even be weighted to feel full. Coins American dollar coin used for concealment A hollow container, fashioned to look like an Eisenhower dollar, is still used today to hide and send messages or film without being detected. Because it resembles ordinary pocket change, it is virtually undetectable as a concealment device. If a hollow coin is suspected, it sometimes can be easily confirmed by weighing against a normal coin on a simple balance. However, more sophisticated hollow coins have had their weight adjusted to match an unaltered coin by including a ring of a dense metal such as lead inside the coin. Typically coins that have no gold or silver content are used so as to further avoid suspicion. Such hollow coins were created from two ordinary coins, by milling out one face and the interior of both coins (to create a cavity), and the edges of one (so it could slide into the other). The half coin with intact edges would also have a pin-prick size hole drilled through its face, so the device could be opened by inserting a pin. A scratch may be added to help line up the faces while closing it--although it is very difficult to detect a slight misalignment by casual inspection. A device of this nature was famously discovered by a paper boy in the \\"Hollow Nickel Case\\". U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was issued with a hollow silver dollar containing a tiny, saxitoxin-impregnated needle, to be used to commit suicide in case of capture by enemy forces. Diversion safe A device whereby a safe-looking safe is left open but has a hidden compartment (e.g., in the door) where small valuable articles can be hidden. As an alternative variant, a safe may be \\"stocked\\" with some lesser valuables, with the expectation that it will be burgled, but that the real safe or hiding place for the important valuables will be missed.  Electrical outlet  A fake electrical outlet, which can be pulled out from the wall and which contains a hidden compartment for storage.  Painting  Thin objects such as papers/money can be concealed in or behind the frame of a painting.  Computers and consumer electronics  Computer equipment and consumer electronics can easily be used for concealing goods and information. Usually the only tool required is a screwdriver, the device can be opened up, have the majority of the electronic and mechanical components removed and replaced with the goods to be concealed. Some of the more common devices used for this purpose are video players such as VHS, CD, DVD and Blu-ray players, computer accessories such as DVD-ROM drives and hard disk drives, battery packs or even a laptop computer itself. More often than not, the majority of the components will be removed to allow more space to conceal an item, but that will render the device inoperable and may arouse suspicion, and it may be of more benefit to preserve the operation of the device at the sacrifice of space. Additionally, the electronic device itself may be subject to theft, thereby defeating the purpose of such a concealment device. In other cases, items may be stored in parts of the machine without having to render it unusable - free space in the form of caddies that would normally be occupied by secondary and tertiary hard drives or disk drives can be large enough to store small items such as money and other valuables.

The 7600 ran at 36.4 MHz (27.5 ns clock cycle) and had a 65 Kword primary memory (with a 60-bit word size) using magnetic core and variable-size (up to 512 Kword) secondary memory (depending on site). It was generally about ten times as fast as the CDC 6600 and could deliver about 10 MFLOPS on hand- compiled code, with a peak of 36 MFLOPS.Gordon Bell. A Seymour Cray Perspective . In addition, in benchmark tests in early 1970 it was shown to be slightly faster than its IBM rival, the IBM System/360, Model 195. When the system was released in 1967, it sold for around $5 million in base configurations, and considerably more as options and features were added. Among the 7600's notable state-of-the-art contributions, beyond extensive pipelining, was the physical C-shape, which both reduced floor space and dramaticallyMultiply by a factor of ten. increased performance by reducing the distance that signals needed to travel.

File:CDC7600_scaling.pngCDC 7600 with scaling File:CDC7600 main overview above.png3D rendering of a full overview of two CDC 7600 As the 6600 neared production quality, Cray lost interest in it and turned to designing its replacement. Making a machine \\"somewhat\\" faster would not be too difficult in the late 1960s; the introduction of integrated circuits allowed denser packing of components and, in turn, a higher clock speed. Transistors in general were also getting somewhat faster\\"They were also more than ten times faster than early MOS transistors\\" as the production processes and quality improved. These sorts of improvements might be expected to make a machine twice as fast, perhaps as much as five times. However, as with the 6600 design, Cray set himself the goal of producing a machine with ten times the performance. One of the reasons the 6600 was so much faster than its contemporaries is that it had multiple functional units that could operate in parallel. For instance, the machine could perform an addition of two numbers while simultaneously multiplying two others. However, any given instruction had to complete its trip through the unit before the next could be fed into it, which caused a bottleneck when the scheduler system ran out of instructions. Adding more functional units would not improve performance unless the scheduler was also greatly improved, especially in terms of allowing it to have more memory, so it could look through more instructions for ones that could be fed into the parallel units. That appeared to be a major problem. In order to solve this problem, Cray turned to the concept of an instruction pipeline. Each functional unit consisted of several sections that operated in turn, for instance, an addition unit might have circuitry dedicated to retrieving the operands from memory, then the actual math unit, and finally another to send the results back to memory. At any given instance only one part of the unit was active, while the rest waited their turn. A pipeline improves on this by feeding in the next instruction before the first has completed, using up that idle time. For instance, while one instruction is being added together, the operands for the next add instruction can be fetched. That way, as soon as the current instruction completes and moves to the output circuitry, the operands for the next addition are already waiting to be added. In this way each functional unit works in \\"parallel\\",\\"parallel functional units\\" as well as the machine as a whole. The improvement in performance generally depends on the number of steps the unit takes to complete. For instance, the 6600's multiply unit took 10 cycles to complete an instruction, so by pipelining the units it could be expected to gain about 10 times the speed. Things are never that simple, however. Pipelining requires that the unit's internals can be effectively separated to the point where each step of the operation is running on completely separate circuitry. This is rarely achievable in the real world. Nevertheless, the use of pipelining on the 7600 improved performance over the 6600 by a factor of about 3. To achieve the rest of the goal, the machine would have to run at a faster speed, now possible using new transistor designs. However, there is a physical limit to performance because of the time it takes signals to move between parts of the machine, which in turn is defined by its physical size. As always, Cray's design work spent considerable effort on this problem and thus allow higher operating frequencies. For the 7600, each circuit module actually consisted of up to six printed circuit boards, each one stuffed with subminiature resistors, diodes, and transistors. The six boards were stacked up and then interconnected along their edges, making a very compact, but basically unrepairable module. However the same dense packing also led to the machine's biggest problemheat. For the 7600, Cray once again turned to his refrigeration engineer, Dean Roush, formerly of the Amana company. Roush added an aluminum plate to the back of each side of the cordwood stack, which were in turn cooled by a liquid-freon system running through the core of the machine. Since this system was mechanical, and therefore prone to failure, the 7600 was redesigned into a large \\"C\\" shape to allow access to the modules on either side of the cooling piping by walking into the inside of the \\"C\\" and opening the cabinet. Architecture The 7600 was an architectural landmark, and most of its features are still standard parts of computer design. It is a reduced-instruction-set computer with a 15-bit instruction word containing a 6-bit operation code. There are only 64 machine codes, including a no-operation code, with no fixed-point multiply or divide operations in the central processor. The 7600 has two main core memories. Small core memory holds the instructions currently being executed and the data currently being processed. It has an access time of 10 of the 27.5-ns minor cycles and a 60-bit word length. Large core memory holds data ready to transfer to small core memory. It has an access time of 60 of the 27.5-ns minor cycles and a word length of 480 bits (512 bits with parity). Accesses are fully pipelined and buffered, so the two have the same sequential transfer rate of 60 bits every 27.5 ns. The two work in parallel, so the sequential transfer rate from one to the other is 60 bits per 27.5 ns minor- cycle. On an operating system call, the contents of the small core memory are swapped out and replaced from the large core memory by the operating system, and restored afterward. There is a 12-word instruction pipeline, called instruction word stack in CDC documentation. All addresses in the stack are fetched, without waiting for the instruction field to be processed. Therefore, the fetch of the target instruction of a conditional branch precedes evaluation of the branch condition. During the execution of a 10-word (up to 40 instruction) loop, all the needed instructions remain in the stack, so no instructions are fetched, leaving small core memory free for data transfers. There are eight 60-bit registers, each with an address register. Moving an address to an address register starts a small core memory read or write. Arithmetic and logic instructions have these registers as sources and destinations. The programmer or compiler tries to fetch data in time to be used and store data before more data needs the same register, but if it is not ready, the processor goes into a wait state until it is. It also waits if one of the four floating-point arithmetic units is not ready when requested, but due to pipelining, this does not usually happen.A lecture given by a CDC representative at the computer center at UCLA, in about 1970. Relationship with the CDC 6600 The CDC 7600 \\"was designed to be machine code upward compatible with the 6600, but to provide a substantial increase in performance\\". One user said: \\"Most users could run on either system without changes.\\" Although the 7600 shared many features of the 6600, including hardware, instructions, and its 60-bit word size, it was not object-code compatible with the CDC 6600.This is not to say it was not backward compatibility, which is when something from the old runs on the new. In addition, it was not entirely source-code (COMPASS) compatible, as some instructions in the 7600 did not exist in the 6600, and vice versa. It had originally been named the CDC 6800, but was changed to 7600 when Cray decided that it could not be completely compatible. However, due to the 7600's operating system design, the 6600 and 7600 shared a \\"uniform software environment\\" despite the low-level differences. In fact, from a high-level perspective, the 7600 was quite similar to the 6600. At the time computer memory could be arranged in blocks with independent access paths, and Cray's designs used this to their advantage. While most machines would use a single CPU to run all the functionality of the system, Cray realized that this meant each memory block spent a considerable amount of time idle while the CPU was processing instructions and accessing other blocks. In order to take advantage of this, the 6600 and 7600 left mundane housekeeping tasks, printing output or reading punched cards, for instance, to a series of ten smaller 12-bit machines based on the CDC 160A known as \\"Peripheral Processor Units\\", or PPUs. For any given cycle of the machine one of the PPUs was in control, feeding data into the memory while the main processor was crunching numbers. When the cycle completed, the next PPU was given control. In this way the memory always held up-to-date information for the main processor to work on (barring delays in the external devices themselves), eliminating delays on data, as well as allowing the CPU to be built for mathematical performance and nothing else. The PPU could have been called a very smart \\"communications channel\\". Like the 6600, the 7600 used 60-bit words with instructions that were generally 15 bits in length, although there were also 30-bit instructions. The instructions were packed into the 60-bit words, but a 30-bit instruction could not straddle two words, and control could only be transferred to the first instruction in a word. However, the instruction set itself had changed to reflect the new internal memory layout, thereby rendering it incompatible with the earlier 6600. The machines were similar enough to make porting of compilers and operating systems possible without too much trouble. The machine initially did not come with software; sites had to be willing to write their own operating system, like LTSS, NCAROS, and others; and compilers like LRLTRAN (Livermore's version of Fortran with dynamic memory management and other non-standard features). CDC also manufactured two multi-processor computers based on the 7600, with the model number 7700.Eventually, they were offered for sale: 2 CDC 7700s, 1 CDC 6400; 6 IBM 3033s were also for sale. They consisted of two 7600 machines in an asymmetric configuration: a central and an adjunct machine. They were used for missile launch and inbound tracking of USSR ICBMs. The radar simulator was a real-time simulator with a CDC 6400 for input/output front-end. These systems were to be used in the Pacific Missile Range. One computer was installed at TRW in Redondo Beach CA (later moved to Kwajalein Atoll, South Pacific), and the second one was installed at McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach, California. They were actual 7600s connected by chassis 25 to make them a 7600 MP. Reception and usage From about 1969 to 1975, the CDC 7600 was generally regarded as the fastest computer in the world, except for specialized units. However, even with the advanced mechanicals and cooling, the 7600 was prone to failure. Both LLNL and NCAR reported that the machine would break down at least once a day, and often four or five times. Acceptance at installation sites took years while the bugs were worked out, and while the machine generally sold well enough given its \\"high end\\" niche, it is unlikely the machine generated any sort of real profits for CDC. The successor CDC 8600 was never completed, and Seymour Cray went on to form his own company, Cray Research. One surviving 7600 is partially on display at the Computer History Museum. Its sheer size allows only two corner units to be shown. The rest are in storage. Another 7600 is on display at the Chippewa Falls Museum of Industry and Technology, along with its console and a tape controller. References External links *Neil R.

She is best known for being a former member of Greece's first ever manufactured girl band, Hi-5, as well as representing Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999 with \\"Tha 'Ne Erotas\\". Angelidou, her mother, and siblings all have double nationality (Greek and British).  Early and later life  Marlain Angelidou was born in Athens, Greece on 6 September 1978 to a Cypriot- born father of mainland Greek origin and a mother of half Scottish and half Greek descent. Due to her father's job position in a multinational company, Marlain Angelidou spent most of her childhood around the world: she emigrated to Venezuela aged 5, learning fluent Spanish (which she has since forgotten), then to Belgium, and back to Cyprus, where she lived during her teenage years, on her father's request to return home. Angelidou is currently based in New York, although her mother, father and brother remain in Cyprus. Marlain Angelidou completed a BSc in Biochemistry with Management at the prestigious Imperial College in London before choosing to study at Boston Conservatory in the US. She also obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in Musical Theatre from London's prestigious Royal Academy of Music.  Career  While she was studying she made her professional debut as the lead in the Stavros ‚ÄôSideras‚Äô musical Pygmalion, The True Story (Aphrodite/Galatea) opposite Peter Polycarpou. She was chosen amongst 5000 teenagers for the National Youth Music Theatre production of Annie (Miss Hannigan) at the Edinburgh Drama Festival. Her professional career started in 1999‚Äì2000 with the production of Aznavour's Lautrec in London's West End. During 2000‚Äì2002 she starred in lead roles in musicals such as Hair (Dionne), Elegies (Judith), toured the UK with Living La Vida Loca (Fantasia), Legends of Swing (singing Ella Fitzgerald songs) and toured Europe with Flower Power Musical Story (Lainer) and Broadway Musical Gala (Principal Soloist) where she had the opportunity to sing solo in front of 11,000 at La Scala in Milan. At the same time she appeared in performances at the Berklee Performance Centre, Boston, USA, Festival Rose D‚ÄôOr in Juin Les Pins, France, some charity events in Basel, Switzerland, and Dublin, Ireland and in concerts with the Cyprus State Orchestra as a soloist. At the end of 2002, at the BBC Radio 2 Voice of Musical Theatre International Competition in Cardiff, Wales, she was the semi-final winner and one of only six finalists. Eurovision Angelides has taken part in a number of Cypriot pre- selections to Eurovision Song Contest, namely in 1998, 1999, 2008 and 2009 and was successful in winning and representing Cyprus in 1999. In her attempt in 1998, she came third duetting \\"Fterougisma\\" with Alex Panayi during the Cypriot pre-Eurovision selections show in which the winner would go on to represent Cyprus in the Eurovision. In 1999, however, she was much more successful with her song \\"Tha 'Ne Erotas\\" winning the Cypriot pre-selection event and represented Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999 with her song. Her song \\"Rejection (Set Me Free)\\", placed first with the jury in the Cyprus Selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, but failed to qualify. The song then moved on to win prizes for Best Performance and Best Song at the Pan Music Festival, Serbia, later that year. Her hard rock 2009 entry for selection for Eurovision under the name Marlain Angelidou and The Diesel Sisters also made a great impression. The song was titled \\"Mr. (Do Right) One Night Stand\\". Her various antics gave her a nomination for Woman of the Year, Madame Figaro Awards 2009. \\"Rejection (Set Me Free)\\" came is second place at Eurovoice 2010. In Hi-5 In 2003, she took part in the Greek television contest Pop Stars, winning one of the five spots in a teen girls group that was to be formed on the basis of the show's outcome. The group was named Hi-5 and released a self-titled album in 2003 that went gold in Greece. The band has had hit songs such as \\"Xero Ti Zitao\\", \\"To Tyhero Asteri\\", and \\"Yennithika Xana\\". Hi-5 released three studio album, the self-titled Hi-5 and Mia Nichta San ki Afti both in 2003 and Makria Apo Afti ti Gi in 2004. The group decided to part quietly off-screen in 2005 on good terms after two years together to pursue solo careers. After Hi-5 From 2005 to 2008, Marlain then continued with her true love singing rock with various bands in clubs and festivals around Greece, namely Volume (Christophoros Chrokides, Stephanos Demetriou, Dimitris Frosinis) and Dickens‚Äô Zoo. With N.U.R.V she played the popular European Music Day at Syntagma Square in Athens and the River Party in Kastoria. She also played the leading role in the West End Athens version of the musical Saturday Night Fever (Stephanie Mangano). She has collaborated with major artists in Greece, namely legendary Greek rock star Vassilis Papakonstantinou in his concert tours of Greece and is currently touring Greece, Cyprus, USA, Europe and Africa with sell-out pop artist Michalis Hadzigiannis, now at the height of his career. Being a fan of cartoons, Marlain also lends her voice regularly to cartoon voice-over translations for Disney and DreamWorks playing a variety of characters from Mulan in Mulan 2, to Lady Bug in James and the Giant Peach, the Soul Singer in Emperor's New Groove 2, Rita the Dog in Oliver and Company, the country-western singer Dixie dubbing the voice of Reba McIntyre, in Fox and the Hound 2 plus many more. She created Bedroom Rock, a collection of songs which give her the total outlet for self-expression. Her first highly driven passionate personal performance as a solo act live in various clubs at the moment in Athens. Life experience, rejection and passion fuel Marlain's new rebranded material, starting with the CD single \\"Being Blonde Today\\" which was released in January 2011. It brings a ballsy approach to contemporary rock, driven by an extreme hunger to perform. Bedroom Rock (live) is the new engine for a well seasoned performer to re- introduce herself to existing and win over new fans.

Typical examples are smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Information appliances partially overlap in definition with, or are sometimes referred to as smart devices, embedded systems, mobile devices or wireless devices.  Appliance vs computer  The term information appliance was coined by Jef Raskin around 1979. As later explained by Donald Norman in his influential The Invisible Computer, the main characteristics of IA, as opposed to any normal computer, were: * designed and pre-configured for a single application (like a toaster appliance, which is designed only to make toast), * so easy to use for untrained people, that it effectively becomes unnoticeable, \\"invisible\\" to them, * able to automatically share information with any other IAs. This definition of IA was different from today's. Jef Raskin initially tried to include such features in the Apple Macintosh, which he designed, but eventually the project went a quite different way. For a short while during the mid- and late 1980s, there were a few models of simple electronic typewriters with screens and some form of memory storage. These dedicated word processor machines had some of the attributes of an information appliance, and Raskin designed one of them, the Canon Cat. He described some properties of his definition of information appliance in his book The Humane Interface. Larry Ellison, Oracle Corporation CEO, predicted that information appliances and network computers would supersede personal computers (PCs). This prediction has not yet come true.

Geography The headwaters are in Mount Aspiring National Park, on the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps near Haast Pass, which is the saddle between the Makarora and Haast River valleys. The Makarora River flows south into the northern end of Lake Wanaka after passing the small community of Makarora. The river attracts some recreational fishing, jetboating and kayaking. Rainbow and brown trout migrate from Lake Wanaka up the river and its tributaries to spawn, mainly in autumn and winter.Info panel at Blue Pools, Department of Conservation NZ Landslide In September 2007 a landslide in the Young River valley blocked off the corresponding stream. Young River is a tributary to Makarora River. The landslide created a new lake. The lake appears to be permanent.

The naumachia (in Latin naumachia, from the Ancient Greek ŒΩŒ±œÖŒºŒ±œáŒØŒ±/naumach√≠a, literally \\"naval combat\\") in the Ancient Roman world referred to both the staging of naval battles as mass entertainment, and the basin or building in which this took place.  Early naumachiae  The first known naumachia was given by Julius Caesar in Rome in 46 BCE on occasion of his quadruple triumph. After having a basin dug near the Tiber, capable of holding actual biremes, triremes and quinqueremes, he made 2000 combatants and 4000 rowers, all prisoners of war, fight. In 2 BCE on the occasion of the inauguration of the Temple of Mars Ultor (\\"Mars the Avenger\\"), Augustus gave a naumachia based on Caesar's model. As cited in Res Gest√¶ (¬ß 23), he created a basin on the right bank of the Tiber where 3000 men, not counting rowers, fought in 30 vessels with rams and a number of smaller boats. Claudius gave a naumachia in 52 CE on a natural body of water, Fucine Lake, to celebrate the completion of drainage work and tunneling on the site. The combatants were prisoners who had been condemned to death. Suetonius' account, written many years after the event, has them salute the emperor with the phrase \\"morituri te salutant\\" (\\"those who are about to die salute you\\"). There is no evidence that this form of address was used on any occasion other than this single naumachia.The phrase is attested in Suetonius, Lives, Claudius, 21, 1214 and a century later, by Cassius Dio, 60, 33, 3‚Äë4, who referred to the same event and probably used Suetonius or a now lost common source. Suetonius gives Claudius' reply as \\"aut non\\" (\\"or not\\"), which the naumachiarii misinterpret as a general pardon, much to the fury of the emperor. See Leon, HJ, Morituri Te Salutamus, Transactions of the American Philological Association, 1939, 70, 46-47: available online at Bill Thayer's website (accessed 1 January 2010) The naumachia was thus a bloodier show than gladiatorial combat, which consisted of smaller engagements and where the combat did not necessarily end with the death of the losers. More exactly, the appearance of naumachia is closely tied and only slightly earlier than that other spectacle, \\"group combat\\", which did not pit single combatants against one another, but rather used two small armies. There again, the combatants were frequently those sentenced to death and lacked the specialized training of true gladiators. Caesar, creator of the naumachia, simply had to transpose the same principle to another environment. Through the choreography of the combat, the naumachia had the ability to represent historical or pseudo-historical themes. Each of the fleets participating represented a maritime power of Ancient Greece or the Hellenistic east: Egyptians and the Tyrians for Caesar‚Äôs naumachia, Persians and Athenians for that of Augustus, Sicilians and Rhodeans for that of Claudius. It required significantly greater resources than other such entertainments, and as such these spectacles were reserved for exceptional occasions, closely tied to celebrations of the emperor, his victories and his monuments. The specific nature of the spectacle as well as the historical themes borrowed from the Greek world are closely tied to the term naumachia. This word, a phonetic transcription of the Greek word for a naval battle (ŒΩŒ±œÖŒºŒ±œáŒØŒ± / naumakh√≠a), has since come to also refer to the large artificial basins created for them. Naumachia building Caesar‚Äôs naumachia was probably a simple basin dug into the low-lying ground on the northern or southern banks of the Tiber, and fed by its waters; the exact location is unknown; most likely Trastavere or the Campus Martius.Coleman, K. M., \\"Launching into History: Aquatic Displays in the Early Empire\\", The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 83 (1993), p. 50; Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, DOI: 10.2307/300978 The naumachia of Augustus is better known: in his Res Gest√¶ (23) Augustus himself indicates that the basin measured 1800 √ó 1200 Roman feet (approximately 533 √ó 355 meters). Pliny the Elder (Natural History, 16, 200), describes an island formed in the center, probably rectangular and connected to the shore by a bridge where the privileged spectators likely sat. Taking into consideration the size of the basin and the dimensions of a trireme (approximately 35 √ó 4.90 meters), the thirty vessels used would hardly be able to manoeuvre. Knowing that the crew of a Roman trireme was approximately 170 rowers and 50 to 60 soldiers, a simple calculation allows us to see that to achieve the number of 3000 men the vessels of Augustus' fleet would have to have held more combatants than an actual fleet. The spectacle thus focused less on the movement of the vessels than the actual presence of them in the artificial basin, and the hand-to-hand combat which developed. It was different for Claudius' naumachia. The two fleets each consisted of 50 vessels, which corresponds to the number of vessels in each of the two military fleets based at Misenum and at Ravenna. Lake Fucino was large enough that only part of it was needed, surrounded by pontoons, and there was room enough for the vessels to manoeuvre and ram each other. The naumachia of Claudius therefore truly reproduced naval combat. According to Sextus Julius Frontinus in De aquaeductu (De aquis urbis Rom√¶, 11, 1-2: opus naumachi√¶), the water supply for the naumachia of Augustus was specially constructed, with the surplus used to water neighbouring gardens in the Trans Tiberim. This was the Aqua Alsietina aqueduct, remains of which have been found on the slopes of Janiculum (the \\"8th hill of Rome\\") below the monastery of San Cosimato. There are several theories as to the precise location of the site; the latest of which places it between Via Aurelia in the north and the church of San Francesco a Ripa in the southeast, in the loop of the Tiber. The republican viaduct discovered in the Via Aurelia near San Crisogono may also have served as a conduit for the basin. The basin did not last very long. During the reign of Augustus it was partly replaced (Suetonius, Augustus, 43, 1) by the nemus C√¶sarum (sacred forest of the Caesars), later renamed \\"forest of Gaius and Lucius\\" for the grandsons of Augustus (Dion Cassius, 66, 25, 3). This vast area was probably built upon by the end of the 1st century. Naumachiae in amphitheatres Old engraving. A new development occurred during the reign of Nero: a naumachia in an amphitheatre. Suetonius (Nero, XII, 1) and Dio Cassius (Roman History, LXI, 9, 5) speak of such a spectacle in 57 AD in a wooden amphitheatre inaugurated by the last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Nothing is known of the site other than that it was built on the Campus Martius. Nero presented another naumachia in 64 AD. This was preceded by hunts and followed by gladiatorial combat and a great banquet (Dio Cassius, LXII, 15, 1). It is unknown what form these games took. It was probably the same wooden amphitheatre, given that there is no mention of its destruction before the great fire of Rome which happened shortly afterwards. For the inauguration of the Colosseum in 80 AD, Titus gave two naumachiae, one in the Augustinian basin, again using several thousand men, and the other in the new amphitheatre (Dio Cassius, LXVI, 25, 1-4). According to Suetonius (Domitian, IV, 6-7), Domitian organised a naumachia inside the Colosseum, undoubtedly circa 85 AD, and another one in the year 89 AD in a new basin dug beyond the Tiber; with the stone removed serving to repair the Circus Maximus, which had burnt on two sides. It was probably in the time between these two naumachia that Domitian completed the network of rooms underneath the Colosseum that are visible today, at the same time precluding such spectacles in the arena. The arena at the Colosseum only measured 79.35 √ó 47.20 meters, far removed from the dimensions of the Augustinian basin. A naumachia in the Colosseum could therefore not have been as grand as the previous ones. One can imagine a confrontation between the crews of several reproductions of warships, potentially life-size or reasonably close to it, but actual maneuvers or even floating seems doubtful. It is known that stage-props were used to represent ships, sometimes with mechanisms to simulate shipwrecks, both on stage and in the arena (Tacitus, Annales, XIV, 6, 1; Dio Cassius LXI, 12,2). Water in the amphitheatres The use of enough water to float vessels in amphitheatres raises technical questions. Amphitheatres were not exclusively used for naumachiae; they would have been filled and drained rapidly enough for use in gladiatorial combats and other spectacles. The rapid transition between water shows and earth-based shows seems to have been one of the great attractions. Dio Cassius underscores this as it relates to Nero's naumachia (LXI, 9, 5); Martial does as well speaking of Titus' naumachia in the Colosseum (Book of Spectacles, XXIV). The only surviving written sources offer no descriptions of the mechanisms or engineering involved. Archaeology provides no clues: the basement of the Colosseum has since been modified. Only two provincial amphitheatres, those at Verona and M√©rida, Spain, provide any technical evidence. The central pit of the Verona amphitheatre was deeper than the rooms normally found underneath the arena, and served as a basin. It was connected to two axial conduits. One, circulating under the West gallery of the arena, was not connected to the drainage system and had to be connected to an aqueduct in order to fill the basin. The East conduit was deeper and designed to drain water into the Adige River. The basin at the M√©rida amphitheatre, at only 1.5 meters, was shallower than that at Verona. Because it is so shallow‚Äîless than the height of a standing man‚Äîit cannot be confused with an underground service room. This basin was equipped with access stairs and covered with material similar to that used for swimming pools and Roman baths. It was also served by two conduits, the western one of which connected to the nearby San Lazaro aqueduct. The dimensions of these basins rule out any but the most basic of naumachiae: the one at M√©rida measures a mere 18.5 √ó 3.7 meters. Only the most modest of water spectacles could have taken place here. This leads one to conclude that, even assuming that the Colosseum had a similar basin before construction of the hypogeum (underground complex), naumachiae would have been performed on only a shallow layer of water covering the surface of the arena, the minimum required to float the ships.  Decline of Roman naumachiae  The introduction of new technologies initially led to an increased number of naumachiae. The first three naumachiae were spaced about 50 years apart; the following six, most of which took place in amphitheatres, occurred in a space of 30 years. Less costly in material and human terms, they could afford to be staged more frequently. Less grandiose, they became a feature of the games, but could not be considered exceptional. The iconography bears witness to this. Of some twenty representations of a naumachia in Roman art, nearly all are of the Fourth Style, of the time of Nero and the Flavian dynasty. 300px After the Flavian period, naumachiae disappear from the texts almost completely. Apart from a mention in the Augustan History, a late source of limited reliability, only the town records (fastia) of Ostia tells us that in 109 Trajan inaugurated a naumachia basin. This site was discovered in the 18th century on the grounds of the Vatican City, northwest of the Castel Sant'Angelos. It is now referred to as the Naumachia Vaticana, with some sources erroneously calling it the Circus of Hadrian due to the similarities of its shape to that of other excavated circuses, along with the site‚Äôs proximity to the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Subsequent digs have revealed the complete site plan. It had bleachers (tiered stands for spectators) and the surface was about one sixth the size of the Augustan naumachia. In the absence of any texts, it has to be assumed that it was only used at the time of Trajan. Nevertheless, if late Roman Empire sources and persistence into the Middle Ages in terms of the toponymy of naumachia and dalmachia at the site are taken into consideration, it still existed into the 5th century. Moreover, the presence of bleachers on its perimeter is a strong indicator of regular shows. According to the Ostia municipal records, the inauguration involved 127 pairs of gladiators; leading one to believe that as in the amphitheatre, the restrictive space at Trajan's basin was not conducive to large combats involving many untrained prisoners, or would have required over-simplification of naval combats, leading to a preference for single combat. In this form, and with a dedicated site, naumachiae could easily have continued (though likely at a reducing frequency) for several centuries without mention in sources, as they would not have been particularly worthy of mention: they simply lost their grandeur and impressive character. In the provinces, the influence of Roman naumachiae is easily discernible, but limited and reduced to local and innocuous naval games and re-enactments. A competition which went under the name of naumaciva was part of the Panathenaic Games between the Athenian Ephebos from the Flavian period onward. It replaced the regattas which had taken place at these games earlier. If Ausonius is to be believed, (Moselle, 200-2,29), a naumachia was held on the Moselle River between local youth.  Post-Roman naumachiae  1589 Wedding at the Palazzo Pitti A naumachia held in Valencia in 1755 A modern naumachia held in the Civic Arena of Milan in 1807 A naumachia was performed for Henry II of France in Rouen in 1550. A nacumachia was part of the festivities of Wedding of Arch Duke Ferdinando I de' Medici and Christine of Lorraine held in the courtyard of the Palazzo Pitti in Florence in 1589. There is an etching of the event that was part of an album created by Orazio Scarabelli to document the wedding festivities. https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/348531 In Scotland naumachia were staged on a loch in Holyrood park in 1562 for the wedding of Lord Fleming and on the Water of Leith in 1581 for the wedding of the Earl of Moray and Elizabeth Stewart.Pesala Bandara, 'Mary Queen of Scot's Aquatic Entertainments for the Wedding of John Fleming to Elizabeth Ross', Margaret Shewring, Waterborne Pageants and Festivities in the Renaissance: Essays in Honour of J.

Another was held in Milan for Napoleon in 1807. Parc Monceau in Paris features a naumachia water feature, surrounded by a colonnade. In 18th and 19th century England, several parks featured mock naval battles with model ships, which were also referred to as naumachia. Peasholm Park in Scarborough, England, still stages such an event. Smaller, theatre-based aqua dramas were also popular.

He was a prominent member of the National Party during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was known for his support of free market economics and trade liberalisation. Quigley left the National Party after clashing with its leadership, and later co-founded the ACT. Early life Quigley in 1963 Quigley was born on 31 January 1932 in Waikari, a small town in the northern Canterbury region, the son of Francis John Quigley. He attended Waipara Primary school before continuing with education in Christchurch; first at Medbury School, then Christ's College, followed by the University of Canterbury. He later donated his personal parliamentary library, which covers his political career until 1984, to Canterbury University's Macmillan Brown Library. He farmed at Waipara from 1949. He gained one of two scholarships for young farmers from the Meat and Wool Board and used it to study farming in Britain and the United States. He completed a law degree while farming and joined a Christchurch law firm, where he became a senior partner and practised as a lawyer. In 1956, Quigley married Judith Ann Dickson, and the couple had four children. He later married Susan McAffer. Member of Parliament Quigley was National's electorate chairman for the Rangiora electorate. In the Canterbury-Westland division, he was deputy chairman. He was a member of the Dominion Council and served on its executive committee. As a 30-year-old, Quigley stood as the National Party's candidate in the in the electorate, but was beaten by Labour's Basil Arthur. He also stood in in the and elections. Quigley stood in the electorate in the . The electorate had been taken from National by Kerry Burke of the Labour Party at the previous election, but was won back by Quigley. Cabinet Minister After three years as a backbencher, Quigley was appointed to Cabinet, and held a number of ministerial roles. He was Minister of Housing (1978‚Äì1982), Minister of Tourism (1981), Minister of Works and Development (1981‚Äì1982), and Associate Minister of Finance (1978‚Äì1981). He held further minor ministerial posts as Minister of Earthquake and War Damage (1978‚Äì1982), Minister of Government Life Insurance (1978‚Äì1982), Minister of Public Trust (1978‚Äì1981), and Minister of State Insurance (1978‚Äì1982). Quigley rapidly earned the hostility of senior National Party figures, however, with his criticism of the government's economic policies. The Prime Minister of the day, Robert Muldoon, favoured decidedly interventionist policies, but Quigley preferred a more laissez-faire approach, and considered Muldoon's interventionism to be contrary to the traditional spirit of the National Party. In February 1981, Quigley contested the deputy leadership of the party, despite Muldoon openly saying that he could not work with him. Quigley's main opponent (and Muldoon's strong favourite) was Duncan MacIntyre, a long-serving Muldoon loyalist. Bill Birch retired from the contest in favour of MacIntyre, and Jim Bolger was eliminated first. Quigley was narrowly defeated by MacIntyre. A week after Quigley lost the deputy leadership race, he was dismissed by Muldoon as Associate Finance Minister, reducing his ability to criticise Muldoon's economic policies effectively; Warren Cooper succeeded him. Quigley nevertheless continued his attacks. In June the following year, he made a public denunciation of the government's policies, saying that the state should have a passive role in the economy. Muldoon and his allies reacted furiously to this public criticism, and Quigley was given the choice of either giving a public apology or resigning from Cabinet; he chose to resign. At the , he resigned from politics altogether, becoming a business consultant. ACT New Zealand One of his many consulting projects was to chair a major review of New Zealand defence for the Lange government. In 1995, Quigley re-entered the political arena, joining forces with Roger Douglas to form the ACT New Zealand party. The new MMP electoral system, which made it easier for smaller parties to win seats, convinced Quigley that a strongly free-market party could indeed be successful. In the 1996 election, the first conducted under MMP, Quigley was returned to Parliament as an ACT list MP and chaired the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee during the next three years. Under Quigley's chairmanship, the select committee produced The Defence Beyond 2000 Report, which became the blueprint for the Clark government's radical restructuring of the New Zealand Defence Force. Quigley did not stand for re-election in 1999 election and was immediately appointed by the incoming Prime Minister to review the contract the previous government had signed with the United States for New Zealand to acquire 28 near new F-16 fighter aircraft. Quigley advised the government to renegotiate the contract and acquire a lesser number of aircraft. One of his reasons for this recommendation was that cancellation of the contract would result in the abandonment of the RNZAF's air combat capability. The government disputed this and cancelled the contract. Two years later, it disbanded the RNZAF's air combat capability, just as predicted. Since early 2004, Quigley and his family have been living in Canberra, where Quigley is a Visiting Fellow at ANU's Strategic & Defence Studies Centre. He is writing extensively on trans Tasman and regional security issues and on the ongoing situation between the United States and New Zealand over the latter's anti-nuclear policy.https://web.archive.org/web/20060112161710/http://rspas.anu.edu.au/sdsc/visitors.php Honours and awards In 1977, Quigley was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2004 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services.

All species are spiny, thistle-like in appearance, with flowerheads that consist of yellow (rarely orange or white) ligulate florets, and canals that contain latex. It is known as ÿ≥ŸÉŸàŸÑŸäŸÖÿ≥ (skwlyms) in Arab, scolyme in French, and is sometimes called golden thistle or oyster thistle in English.  Description  The species of Scolymus are spiny herbaceous annuals, biennials or perennials of up to 1¬æ m high, that contain a milky latex. These have twenty chromosomes (2n=20).  Root, stem and leaves  Biannual and perennial plants produce a stout taproot of up to 8 cm in diameter and 60 cm long. Young plants consist of a rosette of leaves, which may be variegated, once-pinnately spiny-lobed, to 30 cm long, and having short, fleshy stalks. The stems can be simple or carry many branches, and carry spiny wings along their lengths. The wavy leaves with prominent veins are pinnately divided and are alternately set along the stems. The leaf margin has prominent pale green or yellow veins and large teeth which are topped by fierce spines. The leaf surface may initially be covered in soft, felty hairs, which quickly clear away, most slowly on the veins.  Inflorescence, flowers and fruits  flowerhead of S. hispanicus with mites and beetles cypselas encased in their paleae The flowerheads are seated at the end of the stem or in the limbs of the higher leaves, are arranged in a spike or a globose cluster and are subtended by two to more than five leaflike bracts. Each flowerhead is circled by an involucre that consists of many spine-tipped bracts in several rows, the outer papery and shorter than the inner ones, which are leaflike in consistency. These surround the common floral base (or receptacle), which is conical in shape and is set with ovate papery bracts called chaff or paleae. Inplanted are dorsally compressed cypselas, each enclosed by a palea, the outer rows higher than the inner ones. On top of the cypselas there may be two to five stiff scabrous bristles, which are equivalent to sepals (and are called pappus). Also, on top of the cypsela and within the pappus is a yellow, orange or white strap-like corolla which ends in five teeth, together comprising a ligulate floret.  Characters common to all Asteraceae  Like in all Asteraceae, the pentameric flowers have anthers that are fused together forming a tube through which the style grows. The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an indehiscent fruit in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre.  Characters common to Cichorieae  Golden thistles are assigned to the Cichorieae tribe that shares anastomosing latex canals in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In Scolymus these are ligulate florets, common to the group except for Warionia and Gundelia, which only have disk florets. A unique character setting Scolymus apart from the other Cichorieae are the dorsally compressed cypsellas which are surrounded by scales (or paleae).  Differences between the species  S. maculatus is an annual of up to 1¬Ω m high, there are more than five leaflike bracts subtending each globose cluster of flowerheads, and these bracts are pinnately divided. The yellow florets carry some black hairs. The cypselas do not have pappus at their top (but are encased by the paleae). The spined wings along the stems are uninterrupted. Leaves have a whitish vein along their margin. S. grandiflorus is an annual or biennial of up to ¬æ m high with one, two or three leaflike bracts subtending each cluster of flowerheads and these are spiny dentate. The yellow to orange florets do not have black hairs. The cypselas are topped by three to seven bristles of smooth pappus hairs (and are encased by the paleae). The spined wings along the stems are uninterrupted. S. hispanicus is an annual, biennial or perennial of up to 1¬æ m high and it also has one, two or three spiny dentate leaflike bracts subtending each cluster of flowerheads and the yellow, orange or white florets also lack black hairs. The cypselas however are topped by two to five bristles of scabrous pappus hairs (and are encased by the paleae). In this species the spined wings along the stems are interrupted. File:Scolymus hispanicus whole plant.jpgScolymus hispanicus File:Scolymus grandiflorus Monte Pellegrino 07.jpgScolymus grandiflorus File:Scolyme1.jpgScolymus maculatus  Taxonomy   Taxonomic history  In 1576 Carolus Clusius describes Scolimus Theophrasti (= S. hispanicus). In 1601 he extends the genus to three taxa, Scolymus Theophrasti Hispan. (= S. hispanicus subsp. hispanicus), S. Theophrasti Narbonensis (= S. maculatus), and Scolymus Dioscor. Castos Theophrasti (= S. grandiflorus). Rembert Dodoens in 1583 and Francesco Cupani in 1713 introduce the name Carduus Chrysanthemus (for S. maculatus), while in Johann Bauhin‚Äôs posthumously published great work, Historia plantarum universalis (1650-51), it is called Spina lutea, and Robert Morison in 1699 referred to S. hispanicus as Cichorium luteum. Since all of these names predate the start of the Linnean nomenclature in 1753, neither of these were valid. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus referred to the description Joseph Pitton de Tournefort made in 1700, providing the valid scientific name Scolymus.  Subdivisions  Generally two sections are recognised. * Scolymus, containing one species: ** S. maculatus is a species showing very little variability, and no hybrids occur where it grows together with S. hispanicus. * Myscolus, containing two species ** S. grandiflorus has some variability, particularly in the presence of soft hairs on the back of the leaves, but this is not regarded sufficient to distinguish between subtaxa. ** S. hispanicus has quite some variability, and two subspecies have been distinguished. *** subsp. occidentalis *** subsp. hispanicum, which could be subdivided **** var. aggregatus **** var. aurantiacus **** var. hispanicus  Phylogeny  According to recent genetic analyses, the genus Scolymus is related to the genera Hymenonema, Catananche and Gundelia. This results in the following relationship tree.  Etymology  The genus name Scolymus derives from the Greek œÉœáœåŒªœÖŒºŒøœÇ (skolymus) meaning \\"artichoke\\". Pliny used this name for Scolymus hispanicus. The species name hispanicus is Latin and means \\"from Spain\\", while maculatus is Latin and means \\"spotted\\", and grandiflorus is also Latin and means \\"large- flowered\\".  Distribution  * Scolymus grandiflorus occurs in Spain including the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, southern France including Corsica, Italy including Sardinia, Turkey, Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. * Scolymus hispanicus can be found from northwestern France southwards to Morocco, and in the east from the Ukraine to Iran. It is also naturalized in Australia, United States, Argentina and Chile. * Scolymus maculatus grows from Britain to the Canary Islands, throughout the Mediterranean eastwards to Iran. This species is naturalized in Australia and in North Carolina.  Ecology  Scolymus hispanicus it said to grow in the centre of Spain along roads and paths, particularly in unstable, loose and poor soils. The also grow in arable lands, both cultivated and fallowed, and in pastures. The florets are pollinated by insects.  Use  leaves stripped to the middle vein for sale as vegetables cooked egg on midveins of golden thistleAround the Mediterranean, such as in Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, the midveins of the rosette leaves of S. hispanicus, known in Spain as cardillo or tagarnina, are used as a popular wild food. It is generally gathered in April and May. These midveins are preboiled and lightly fried with garlic in olive oil. These serve as garnish for cocido. Fried cardillo is further combined with garlic, cured ham and hard-boiled or scrambled eggs. Midveins are also used raw in salads. The roots are cooked and eaten, and compare in taste to salsify. Roasted roots have been used as a coffee substitute. Florets have been used as imitation saffron. The root bark of S. hispanicus has been shown to contain the triterpenoid taraxasteryl acetate, and this substance is effective in suppressing spasms. In Turkey it is a component of the herbal elixer called lityazol √ßemil. Studies have indicated that Scolymus might be used for the bio-removal of cadmium, with the highest concentration measured over 50 Œºg/g dry weight, and of methylene blue and Eriochrome Black T.

The citizens, including some World War II veterans, accused the local officials of predatory policing, police brutality, political corruption, and voter intimidation. Background In 1936, the E. H. Crump political machine based in Memphis, which controlled much of Tennessee, extended to McMinn County with the introduction of Paul Cantrell as the Democratic candidate for sheriff. Cantrell, who came from a family of money and influence in nearby Etowah, tied his campaign closely to the popularity of the Roosevelt administration and rode FDR's coattails to victory over his Republican opponent in what came to be known as \\"vote grab of 1936\\" which delivered McMinn County to Tennessee's Crump Machine. Paul Cantrell was elected sheriff in the 1936, 1938, and 1940 elections, and was elected to the state senate in 1942 and 1944, while his former deputy, Pat Mansfield, a transplanted Georgian, was elected sheriff. A state law enacted in 1941 reduced local political opposition to Crump's officials by reducing the number of voting precincts from 23 to 12 and reducing the number of justices of the peace from fourteen to seven (including four \\"Cantrell men\\"). The sheriff and his deputies were paid under a fee system whereby they received money for every person they booked, incarcerated, and released; the more arrests, the more money they made. Because of this fee system, there was extensive \\"fee grabbing\\" from tourists and travelers. Buses passing through the county were often pulled over and the passengers were randomly ticketed for drunkenness, regardless of their intoxication or lack thereof. Between 1936 and 1946, these fees amounted to almost $300,000. Citizens of McMinn County had long been concerned about political corruption and possible election fraud though some of the complaints, especially at first, may have been partisan carping. The U.S. Department of Justice had investigated allegations of electoral fraud in 1940, 1942, and 1944, but had not taken action. Voter fraud and vote control perpetuated McMinn County's political problems. Manipulation of the poll tax and vote counting were the primary methods, but it was common for dead voters' votes to appear in McMinn County elections. The political problems were further entrenched by economic corruption of political figures enabled by the gambling and bootlegging they permitted. Most of McMinn County's young men were fighting in World , allowing appointment of some ex-convicts as deputies. These deputies furthered the political machine's goals and exerted control over the citizens of the county. While the machine controlled the law enforcement, its control also extended to the newspapers and schools. When asked if the local newspaper, the Daily Post-Athenian, supported the GIs, veteran Bill White, replied: \\"No, they didn't help us none.\\" White elaborated: \\"Mansfield had complete control of everything, schools and everything else. You couldn't even get hired as a schoolteacher without their okay, or any other job.\\" During the war, two service men on leave were shot and killed by Cantrell supporters. The servicemen of McMinn County heard of what was going on and were anxious to get home and do something about it. According to a contemporaneous article by Theodore H. White in Harper's Magazine, one veteran, Ralph Duggan, who had served in the Pacific in the Navy and became a leading lawyer in the postwar period, \\"thought a lot more about McMinn County than he did about the Japs. If democracy was good enough to put on the Germans and the Japs, it was good enough for McMinn County, too!\\" The scene was ripe for a confrontation when McMinn County's GIs were demobilized. When they arrived home the deputies targeted the returning GIs, one reported: \\"A lot of boys getting discharged [were] getting the mustering out pay. Well, deputies running around four or five at a time grapping [sic] up every GI they could find and trying to get that money off of them, they were fee grabbers, they wasn't on a salary back then.\\" In the August 1946 election, Paul Cantrell ran again for sheriff, while Pat Mansfield ran for the State Senate seat. Stephen Byrum, a local history author, speculates that the reason for this switch was an attempt to spread the graft among themselves. Bill White, meanwhile, claims the reason for the swap was because they thought Cantrell stood a better chance running against the GIs. The GIs were motivated more by hostility towards Sheriff Mansfield and his deputies rather than against Cantrell whose period as sheriff had been relatively benign. McMinn County had around 3,000 returning military veterans, constituting almost 10 percent of the county population. Some of the returning veterans resolved to challenge Cantrell's political control by fielding their own nonpartisan candidates and working for a fraud-free election. A meeting was called in May; veteran ID was required for admission. A non-partisan slate of candidates was selected. Veteran Bill White described the veterans' motivation: The members of the GI Non-Partisan League were very careful to make their list of candidates match the demographics of the county, three Republicans and two Democrats. A respected and decorated veteran of the North African campaign, Knox Henry, stood as candidate for sheriff in opposition to Cantrell. Large contributions made by local businessmen to the GIs' campaign ensured that it was well-funded, although many of McMinn County's citizens believed the machine would rig the election. The veterans capitalized on this belief with the slogan \\"Your Vote Will Be Counted As Cast.\\" Well aware of the methods of Sheriff Mansfield and his associates, the League organized a counterpoise. A \\"fightin' bunch\\" was organized by Bill White \\"to keep the thugs from beating up GIs and keep them from taking the election.\\" White created his organization carefully; he later recalled: \\"I got out and started organizing with a bunch of GIs. Well spirits‚ÄîI learned that you get the poor boys out of poor families, and the ones that was frontline warriors that's done fighting and didn't care to bust a cap on you. I learned to do that. So that's what I picked. I had thirty men and ... I took what mustering out pay I got and bought pistols. And some of them had pistols. I had thirty men organized\\". Sheriff Mansfield also organized for the upcoming election, hiring 200 deputies, most from neighboring counties, some from out of state, at $50 a day ().  Initial confrontations   Water Works polling place  Polls for the county election opened August 1, 1946. Normally, there were about 15 patrolmen on duty for the precincts, but about 200 armed deputies were on patrol for the election, with many of these reinforcements from other counties and states. In Etowah, a GI poll watcher requested a ballot box to be opened and certified as empty. Although he was allowed by law to make the request, he was arrested and taken to jail. In Athens, Walter Ellis protested irregularities in the election and was also arrested and charged with what was explained to him as a \\"federal offense\\". Around 3:00 p.m. local time, C.M. \\"Windy\\" Wise, a patrolman, prevented an elderly African American farmer, Tom Gillespie, from casting his ballot at the Athens Water Works polling place. When Gillespie and a GI poll watcher objected, Wise struck Gillespie with brass knuckles, which caused Gillespie to drop his ballot and run away from the deputy. Wise then pulled his pistol and shot Gillespie in the back. Wise was the only person to face charges from the events of August 1‚Äì2, 1946, and was sentenced to 1‚Äì3 years in prison.  Response  GIs gathered in front of L.L. Shaefer's store which was used as an office by campaign manager Jim Buttram. Buttram had telegraphed Governor McCord in Nashville and U.S. Attorney General Tom Clark asking for help in ensuring a lawful election, but received no response. When the group learned that Sheriff Mansfield had sent armed guards to all polling places, they convened at the Essankay Garage where they decided to arm themselves. Sheriff Mansfield arrived at the Water Works and ordered the poll closed. In the commotion that followed, Wise and Karl Nell, the deputies inside the Water Works, took two poll watchers, Charles Scott and Ed Vestal, captive. By one account, Scott and Vestal jumped through a glass window and fled to the safety of the crowd while Wise followed behind. By another account there was a guns-drawn confrontation between Jim Buttram, who was accompanied by Scott's father, and Sheriff Mansfield. A third account argues that when Neal Esminger from the Daily Post-Athenian showed up to get a vote count, his entrance was a distraction that allowed Scott and Vestal to break through a door and escape. In any case, the escape was followed by gunfire which sent the crowd diving for cover. Someone in the crowd yelled, \\"Let's go get our guns,\\" causing the crowd to head for the Essankay Garage. Deputy Chief Boe Dunn took the two deputies and the ballot box to the jail. Two other deputies were dispatched to arrest Scott and Vestal. These deputies were disarmed and detained by the GIs, as were a set of reinforcements. GI advisor, Republican Election Commissioner and Republican Party Chairman, Otto Kennedy, asked Bill White what he was going to do. White said, \\"I don't know Otto; we might just kill them.\\" According to White, Kennedy grew alarmed and announced \\"Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord! No! I'm not having nothing else to do with this. Me and my brother and son-in-law is leaving here.\\" Lones Selber in American Heritage magazine says Kennedy \\"left, vowing to have no part in murder.\\" The crowd and most GIs left. The remaining GIs took the seven deputies-turned-hostages to a woods ten miles from Athens, stripped them, tied them to a tree and beat them.  Twelfth Precinct Polling Place  At the twelfth precinct the GI poll watchers were Bob Hairrell and Leslie Doolie, a one-armed veteran of the North African theater. The polling place was commanded by Mansfield man Minus Wilburn. Wilburn tried to let a young woman vote, who Hairrell believed was underage, and had no poll tax receipt and was not listed in the voter registration. Hairrell grabbed Wilburn's wrist when he tried to deposit the ballot in the box. Wilburn struck Hairrell on the head with a blackjack and kicked him in the face. Wilburn closed the precinct and took the GIs and ballot box across the street to the jail. Hairrell was brutally beaten and was taken to the hospital. In response to cussing and taunts from the deputies, and the actions so far that day, Bill White, leader of the \\"fighting bunch,\\" told his lieutenant Edsel Underwood to take 5 or 6 men and break into the National Guard Armory to steal weapons. The GIs took the front door keys from the caretaker and entered the building. They then armed themselves with sixty .30-06 Enfield rifles, two Thompson sub-machine guns and ammo. Lones Selber says White went for the guns himself. Bill White then distributed the rifles and a bandoleer of ammo to each of the 60 GIs.  Polls closing  As the polls closed, and counting began (sans the three boxes taken to the jail), the GI-backed candidates had a 3 to 1 lead. When the GIs heard the deputies had taken the ballot boxes to the jail, Bill White exclaimed, \\"Boy, they doing something. I'm glad they done that. Now all we got to do is whip on the jail.\\" The GIs recognized that they had broken the law, and that Cantrell would likely receive reinforcements in the morning, so the GIs felt the need to resolve the situation quickly. The deputies knew little of military tactics, but the GIs knew them well. By taking up the second floor of a bank across the street from the jail, the GIs were able to reciprocate any shots from the jail with a barrage from above. By 9:00 PM, Paul Cantrell, Pat Mansfield, George Woods (Speaker of the State House of Representatives and Secretary of the McMinn County Election Commission), and about 50 deputies were in the jail, allegedly rummaging through the ballot boxes. Woods and Mansfield constituted a majority of the election commission and could therefore certify and validate the count from within the jail.  Battle  Estimates of the number of veterans besieging the jail vary from several hundred to as high as 2,000. Bill White had at least 60 under his command. White split his group with Buck Landers taking up position at the bank overlooking the jail while White took the rest by the Post Office. Just as the estimates of people involved vary widely, accounts of how the Battle of Athens began and its actual course disagree. Egerton and Williams recall that when the men reached the jail, it was barricaded and manned by 55 deputies. The veterans demanded the ballot boxes but were refused. They then opened fire on the jail, initiating a battle that lasted several hours by some accounts, considerably less by others. As Lones Selber, author of the 1985 American Heritage magazine article wrote: \\"Opinion differs on exactly how the challenge was issued.\\" White says he was the one to call it out: \\"Would you damn bastards bring those damn ballot boxes out here or we are going to set siege against the jail and blow it down!\\" Moments later the night exploded in automatic weapons fire punctuated by shotgun blasts. \\"I fired the first shot,\\" White claimed, \\"then everybody started shooting from our side.\\" A deputy ran for the jail. \\"I shot him; he wheeled and fell inside of the jail.\\" In 2000 Bill White claimed he said \\"Boys, ... I'm going to tell them to bring the ballot box out of there, and if they don't we're gonna open up on them.' I hollered in there, I said, 'You damn thieve grabbers, bring them damn ballot boxes out of there.' 'That's just what I said. He didn't make a move down there and finally one of them said, 'By God I heard a bolt click.' Down there‚Äîone of them grabbers did, you know‚Äîthey started scattering around. And I had a pistol in my belt with a shotgun. I had a shotgun and a rifle. And I pulled the pistol out and started firing down there at them. Well, when I did that, all that whole line up there started firing down there in there. A lot of them got in the jail, some of them didn't, some of them got shot laying outside. And the battle started.\\" Byrum wrote in 1984 that there was a volley of fire that lasted for \\"several hours,\\" although gives no exact time for the end of hostilities or an account of the course of the battle. He noted that the deputies surrendered at 3:30 AM. The day after the battle, the New York Times front page reported a sheriff had been killed, and that the shooting had started with a shot through a jail window and with the demand the hostages be released. Then the Times reported the deputies refused and the siege ensued. The account followed, revealing the Times source as Lowell F. Arterburn, publisher of The Athens Post Athenian. Arterburn reported shots being fired, 2,000 persons milling around, and \\"at least a score of fist fights were in progress.\\" An attempt by deputies outside the jail to reinforce (or take refuge in) the jail was thwarted by Bill White's \\"fighting band\\". Some people in the jail managed to escape out the back door. The fleeing people threw down their weapons and ran off, so White ordered his forces not to shoot the escapees. One of the escapees was George Woods who had telephoned Birch Biggs, the boss of next door Polk County, requesting that Biggs send reinforcements to break the siege. Biggs replied \\"Do you think I'm crazy?\\" For the veterans it was either win before morning or face a long time in jail for violating local, state, and federal laws. Rumors spread that the National Guard or state troopers were coming. White made hourly demands for surrender. The GIs attempted to bombard the jail with Molotov cocktails but were not able to throw them far enough to reach the jail. The GIs decided to resort to dynamite. At about that time an ambulance pulled up to the jail. The GIs assumed it was called to remove the wounded and held fire. Two men jumped in, and it sped off carrying Paul Cantrell and Sheriff Mansfield to safety out of town. Then the dynamite was deployed. Bill White said, \\"We'd put two or three sticks of dynamite together and tape it together and put a cap in there and a fuse. And we'd rear back and throw them. Well, we couldn't get them all the way to the jail, but we got them out to them cars. They'd blow them cars up in the air and turn them over and land them back on the top. Several cars down there were blowing up.\\" That first bomb landed under Bob Dunn's cruiser, flipping it on its back. Bill White, commander of the \\"fighting bunch\\" knew the GIs had to do better: \\"I ... said, 'We're going to have to get some charges up there on that jail.' I said, 'Make a couple charges there.... We'll go down there and we'll place some charges.' So I made up a couple charges and I crawled up and put a charge on the jailhouse porch.\\" In fact three bombs went off almost simultaneously. One destroyed Mansfield's car, one landed on the jail porch roof, and one went off against the jail wall. The bombs caused some damage to the jail and scattered debris. As with the beginning of the battle, accounts of the end differ: American Heritage states, \\"In the end, the door of the jail was dynamited and breached. The barricaded deputies‚Äîsome with injuries‚Äîsurrendered, and the ballot boxes were recovered.\\" The New York Times observed in an article the night was \\"bloody\\" and that it ended after the GIs detonated 3 \\"home-made demolition charges.\\"  End of the battle and vote counting  Byrum reported the end of the battle thusly: \\"By 3:30 a.m., the men holding the jail had been dynamited into submission, and by early morning George Woods was calling Ralph Duggan to ask if he could come to Athens and certify the election of the GI slate. Bill White reported that \\"when the GIs broke into the jail, they found some of the tally sheets marked by the machine had been scored fifteen to one for the Cantrell forces.\\" When the final tally was completed, Knox Henry was elected. During the fight at the jail, rioting had broken out in Athens, mainly targeting police cars. This continued after the ballot boxes were recovered, but subsided by morning. The mob also destroyed automobiles of the deputies, many bearing out-of-state plates. During the disorder the Mayor of Athens was on vacation and the city policemen were \\"nowhere to be found.\\" The morning of August 2 found the town quiet. Some minor acts of revenge happened, but the public mood was one of \\"euphoria that had not been experienced in McMinn County in a long time.\\" Governor McCord initially moved to activate the National Guard but quickly rescinded the order. The morning saw the GIs call a meeting. GI Non-Partisan League Treasurer Harry Johnson opened the meeting observing it was necessary because \\"for some reason or other, the Sheriff's force is not around.\\" The approximately 400 persons in the court room elected a special committee headed by Methodist minister Bernie Hampton, joined by C.A. Anderson and Gobo Cartwright, both members of the Business Men's Evangelical Committee, to preserve law and order. George Woods, the escaped Secretary of the County Election Commission, sent a written missive saying: \\"Next Monday at 10 A.M. I will sign an election certificate certifying that the GI ticket was elected.\\" Later the veterans turned responsibility for maintaining order in Athens to Police Chief Herbert Walker. The GIs said they were still \\"holding control\\" of McMinn County until September 1 when Knox Henry was to be installed as sheriff. August 2 also saw the return to McMinn County of Sheriff-elect Knox Henry, who had spent the night of August 1‚Äì2 in safe keeping in the Sweetwater jail. Sheriff Henry, a 33-year-old former Army Air Force Sergeant, observed \\"They were going to kill me yesterday, and I had to leave town.\\"  Nearby conflicts  In adjacent Meigs County, another use of weapons to effect electoral change occurred. On August 5 the Meigs County Election Commission certified Republican Oscar Womac as sheriff. Womac admitted to a reporter that he had ordered some associates to burn \\"a bunch of ballots.\\" The ballots, he claimed, were found in the Meigs County Courthouse the previous day. It was reported in The Chattanooga Times that Sheriff J.T. Pettit claimed the Peakland ballot box was taken at gun-point by Womac and companions from the County Clerk's office the day before the ballot burning. \\"There was little we could do to stop him, he was armed, and the four men with him were armed,\\" Sheriff Pettit said. In Monroe County, east of McMinn County and north of Polk County, 65 year old county sheriff Jake Tipton was shot and killed during a dispute at the Vale precinct. Aftermath The recovered ballots certified the election of the five GI Non-Partisan League candidates. Among the reforms instituted was a change in the method of payment and a $5,000 salary cap for officials. In the initial momentum of victory, gambling houses in collusion with the Cantrell regime were raided and their operations demolished. Deputies of the prior administration resigned and were replaced. The ballots, when tallied, proved a landslide for the GI Non-Partisan League. Scores of veterans were present when Speaker of the state House of Representatives and secretary of the McMinn County election commissioners George Woods was marched into the County Courthouse under the guard of ex-GIs. Speaker Woods had fled after the gun battle. League member Knox Henry received 2,175 against 1,270 for Sheriff Cantrell. The League also won the other races: 2,194 to 1,270 for Frank Carmichael as trustee; George Painter won the county clerk race 2,175 to 1,198; the circuit court clerk broke 2,165 to 1,197 for Charles Picket. Bill White, leader of the \\"fighting bunch,\\" was made a sheriff's deputy. \\"They put me in as a deputy. Because, one of the reasons they put me in as deputies was to scare them GIs. (Laughs) They wanted me to control the GIs. Which they did‚Äîthey fired into them people's houses and everything else. And that was my job to get out there and keep the GIs straight. And I did. I had sixteen fights in one weekend. Fighting GIs, keeping them from shooting them people's houses and beating up people. My fists got so sore I couldn't stick them in my pocket ... If you fight them with your fists, they had respect for you. But you didn't use blackjacks or guns on them. If you did they'd gang up on you and kill you.\\" According to deputy Bill White the fee basis for deputy pay continued for four more years. It was only the last four years he served that he was paid a salary. In early September the fall of the County political machine was followed by the resignation of Athens' Mayor, Paul Walker, and the town's four Aldermen. The resignations met with popular approval. The resignations came after a night time shot-gun blast through the front of Alderman Hugh Riggs's home. Mayor Walker had previously refused a demand to resign made immediately after the gun-fight by the McMinn County American Legion and VFW posts. The \\"Battle of Athens\\" was followed by movements of veterans in other Tennessee counties promoting a statewide coalition against corrupt political machines in the upcoming November elections. Governor McCord countered an attempt to form a \\"Non-Partisan GI Political League\\" by directing the Young Democrats Clubs of Tennessee to recruit ex-GIs. There were strenuous efforts by the \\"Crump Organization,\\" based in Shelby County, to counter the nascent GI organization. A convention was held in Alamo, Tennessee, with the intention to establish a new national party. The convention was dissuaded by General Evans Carlson, USMC, who argued that the GIs should work through the existing political parties. The new GI government of Athens quickly encountered challenges including the re-emergence of old party loyalties. On January 4, 1947, four of the five leaders of the GI Non-Partisan League declared in an open letter: \\"We abolished one machine only to replace it with another and more powerful one in the making.\\" The GI government in Athens eventually collapsed. Tennessee's GI political movement quickly faded and politics in the state returned to normal. The Non-Partisan GI Political League replied to enquiries by veterans elsewhere in the United States with the advice that shooting it out was not the most desirable solution to political problems. Legacy Joseph C. Goulden, in his history of immediate post-war America, The Best Years 1945-1950, discussed the Battle of Athens, how it sparked political ex-GI movements in three other Tennessee counties, as well as other boss-ruled Southern states, led to a convention with representatives from several Southern states, and how it raised fears that veterans would resort to further violence. The Battle of Athens came in the mid-1940s, when there was much concern that returning GIs would be dangerously violent. Those concerns were addressed in an opinion piece by Warden Lawes, the author of Twenty Thousand Years at Sing Sing, in a New York Times opinion piece. In a newspaper column, Eleanor Roosevelt had expressed a somewhat popular opinion that GIs should be checked for violent tendencies before they were demobilized. Bill White, the leader of Athens' \\"fighting band\\", came to see her point. One of the reasons the GI League collapsed was the continuing GI related violence in McMinn County. The Battle of Athens initially received criticism in the press. Coverage however quickly faded, and after Alan J. Gould, an executive with the Associated Press, told the Conference of State Directors of the Veterans Administration that the AP would try to suppress the use of the word \\"veteran\\" in conjunction with crime stories, the story of GI violence began to disappear. The 1992 made-for-television movie An American Story (produced by the Hallmark Hall of Fame) was loosely based upon the McMinn County War but set in a Texas town in 1945. It was nominated for two 1993 prime time Emmy Awards and one American Society of Cinematographers award. The battle is also mentioned in the 1996 pro-gun rights novel Unintended Consequences and in the 2007 film Shooter. In 1996, C. Stephen Byrum, author of the history of McMinn County, published August 1, 1946. The Battle of Athens, Tennessee.

Jean de Lorraine was appointed on nomination by the King. He was a personal friend, companion, and advisor of King Francis I of France. Jean de Lorraine was the richest prelate in the reign of Francis I, as well as the most flagrant pluralist. He is one of several cardinals known as the Cardinal de Lorraine. Biography Born in Bar-le-Duc, Jean was the sixth child of twelve, of Ren√© II, Duke of Lorraine and his wife Philippa of Guelders, sister of Charles, Duke of Guelders. He was a younger brother of Antoine, Duke of Lorraine and Claude, Duke of Guise. His younger brother, Fran√ßois, Comte de Lambesc, died in the Battle of Pavia in 1525. In 1520 his mother retired to the Convent of S. Claire du Pont-√†-Mousson, where she became a professed nun. Bishop of Metz In 1500 baby Jean succeeded Cardinal Raymond Peraudi as Coadjutor of his uncle Henri de Vaudemont-Lorraine, Bishop of Metz. The Chapter of the Cathedral gave its consent, on 3 November 1500, and Pope Alexander VI gave his consent in 1501. The Cardinal was compensated for his trouble with the monastery of S. Mansu in Toul. The purpose of such a strange arrangement was the desire of Duke Ren√© to keep the bishopric of Metz in family hands. Bishop Henri formally resigned the See of Metz on 16 July 1505 in favor of his nephew Jean, but, due to Jean's extreme youth, Henri continued as Administrator until his own death on 20 October 1505. From that point the Cathedral Chapter, whose Dean was the Bishop of Toul, assumed responsibility for the administration of the diocese, until Jean de Lorraine became twenty in 1518, with Jean receiving one-third of the episcopal revenues. Spiritual functions were in the hands of the Bishop of Nicopolis, Conrad de Heyden, O.Cist., suffragan of Metz.Meurisse, pp. 598‚Äì600. Gulik and Eubel, p. 242 and n. 2. Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi II edition altera (Monasterii 1914), p. 242 with notes 2 and 3; and p. 279. Despite his youth, on 19 October 1517, following the death of Bishop Hugh de Hazards, Jean de Lorraine was elected Bishop of Toul by the Chapter of the cathedral. He resigned the bishopric in 1524.Meurisse, p. 602. Gulik and Eubel, p. 321 and n. 3. It is conjectured that Jean was introduced to the French Court and met King Francis for the first time at the wedding of his brother Antoine to Ren√©e de Bourbon on 26 June 1515.Michon, pp. 35‚Äì36. Cardinal Cardinal Thomas Wolsey On 28 May 1518 Jean de Lorraine, Bishop of Metz, aged twenty, was created a Cardinal-Deacon by Pope Leo X in his seventh Consistory for the creation of cardinals. Jean was the only cardinal created on that occasion. Leo, who had been made a cardinal himself at the age of thirteen, could hardly refuse the King of France on the grounds of youth. On 7 January 1519 he was assigned the Deaconry of S. Onofrio in Trastevere, and his red hat was sent to him in France. He visited Rome in April 1521, at which time he was admitted to Consistory.Gulik and Eubel, p. 18, with notes 1 and 2. He had already returned home when Leo X died on 1 December 1521, and thus he did not attend the Conclave of 27 December 1521 ‚àí 9 January 1522, which elected Cardinal Adrian Florenszoon Dedel, who took the throne name Pope Adrian VI.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1521‚Äì1522. Retrieved: 2016-5-6. In 1520 Jean de Lorraine was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, along with Cardinals Adrien Gouffier de Boissy, Fran√ßois Louis de Bourbon, and Amanieu d'Albret; but he played no political role.Michon, pp. 35‚Äì36, 39. And indeed his non-political position continued to be the case throughout the 1520s.Michon, p. 39. Cardinal Jean de Lorraine was appointed Bishop of Terouanne (Morinensis) on 29 October 1521, taking possession of his church on 7 January 1522.Gallia christiana 10 (Paris 1751), p. 1570. Meurisse, p. 602. Gulik and Eubel, p. 250, who point out that by 10 March 1521 the Cardinal still had not been consecrated a bishop. He held the See until 1535. From 1522 his career path is that of an individual who enjoys without interruption the favor of the King, all the way to the King's death in 1547. He enjoyed the status of favorite, along with the realities of familiar and counsellor.Michon, p. 60. Archbishop of Narbonne On 7 January 1524 Cardinal Jean was named Archbishop of Narbonne, in succession to Giulio de' Medici who had been elected Pope Clement VII. He held the church until his death.Gallia christiana 6, p. 112. Gulik and Eubel, p. 253. In August 1527 the Cardinal de Lorraine was appointed by King Francis to meet and greet Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who had come to France to negotiate with King Francis, and to escort him to the French Court. He was not yet a royal advisor or a member of the Royal Council, but was being tested and groomed. He was, after all, only twenty-nine years old. Negotiations were conducted with Wolsey by royal commissioners, leading to the Treaty of Amiens, ratified by the King on 18 August. The treaty addressed the joint English and French reaction to the Sack of Rome (1527) in May 1527 and the imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in the Castel S. Angelo. But the Cardinal de Lorraine had no part in that business. The principal negotiator was the Chancellor, Antoine du Prat. He was, however, one of the four French cardinals who were present at Compi√®gne on 16 September and wrote, under Wolsey's leadership as Papal Legate, to the Pope, informing him that they were praying for his release from captivity and planned, if the Emperor should not accommodate them, to refuse any papal orders issued under duress. He also witnessed the investing of the Chancellor, Antoine du Prat, with the symbols of the cardinalate which had been granted him by the Pope at the request of King Francis. His growing importance is reflected in a list of precedence of 1528, in which he and the King of Navarre follow immediately after the King.Michon, p. 41. Starkey, pp. 42‚Äì78. Abbeys: Cluny, F√©camp, Gorze Francis I of France In 1528 he was named Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Cluny by King Francis I, a benefice he held until his death in 1550. The monks of Cluny had tried to reassert their old rights of election, and had chosen Jacques le Roy, Abbot of Saint-Florent, to be the new abbot of Cluny, but the King and the Pope intervened, in accordance with the Concordat of Bologna of 1516, and Le Roy was made Archbishop of Bourges instead.Gallia christiana 10 (Paris 1751), p. 1570. On 1 August 1530, Pope Clement VII granted the Cardinal of Lorraine an indult allowing him to hold and accumulate the benefices in his diocese of Narbonne and the benefices of his abbeys. On 26 March 1531, King Francis signed an order to his treasurer to pay his lost wagers to the Sieur de Villiers, the result of a tennis match with the Cardinal de Lorraine and others on March 1. In 1532, Jean de Lorraine was named Abbot Commendatory of the royal abbey of F√©camp by the patronage of King Francis I.Gallia christiana 11, p. 214. He held the Abbey during his lifetime. In 1534 Pope Paul III named Cardinal de Lorraine his Apostolic Legate in the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun.Fisquet, p. 385. Part of his ecclesiastical preferment he gave up in favour of his nephews, as part of the strategy of establishing the family of Lorraine permanently in various benefices. Pope Clement VII died on 25 September 1534, having lived 56 years. The Conclave of 1534 opened on 10 October 1534, and Cardinal de Lorraine was present as the leader of the French faction, which numbered between ten and twelve members. Their candidate was Cardinal Fran√ßois de Tournon, who had negotiated the marriage of Henri, King Francis' second son, and Catherine de' Medici. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese was supported by Cardinal Ippolito d'Este and his fellow Florentine cardinals who had been created by Clement VII. The Italians favored Agostino Trivulzio, the Protector of France before the Holy See and the holder of several French episcopal benefices, whose uncles were Marshals of France, but he realized that he could not marshal sufficient votes to be elected. He therefore threw his support behind the oldest of the cardinals, Alessandro Farnese, hoping that Farnese's reign would be a short one and that he would be in a better position at the next conclave. Farnese was elected by acclamation on 11 October, the first day of voting, and was formally elected by ballot the next morning. He chose the name Paul III, and reigned for fifteen years. Trivulzio died the year before Paul did.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1534. Retrieved: 2016-05-11. Royal Councillor He became a regular member of the royal council in 1530.Michon, p. 42. In 1536 he was entrusted with an embassy to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.Barbiche and Dainville-Barbiche, p. 153. He met the Emperor, who was travelling north to Genoa, at Siena on 24 April 1536. He spent three days with the Emperor explaining the concessions which Francis I was prepared to make, but Charles was prepared for war, and rejected the French overtures. After a quick trip to Rome to inform the Pope of the situation and to discover what the Pope's intentions were, Jean de Lorraine headed back north toward Bologna to try one last time to argue peace to the Emperor. The Pope, who was trying to maintain neutrality, sent legates to both sovereigns on 29 April to argue for peace, but it was without effect. The invasion of southern France by the Emperor was inevitable. There survives a document showing that on 12 July 1536 the Cardinal de Lorraine was possessed of the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun, of the Abbey of Gorze in southern Lorraine (1533‚Äì1542),He resigned the Abbey of Gorze in favor of his nephew, Nicholas of Lorraine. and of the castellanies of Hattonch√¢tel, Dombasle-en-Argonne, Thilly, Mangiennes, Fresnes-en-Woevre, Dieudouard, and Sampigny. In 1537 he was granted the Abbey of Saint-M√©dard in Soissons, which he held for two years.Gallia christiana 9, p. 421. When the Dauphin Francis died at Ch√¢teau Tournon-sur-Rh√¥ne on 10 August 1536, the rest of the courtiers tried to delay presenting the disastrous news by telling the King that the Dauphin was increasingly ill. When Francis finally realized he was being lied to, it was the Cardinal de Lorraine who was left alone with the King by the courtiers and he had to confirm the news of the death of the King's son. The King retired to indulge his grief without witnesses, and left it to Cardinal de Lorraine to make the appropriate arrangements. Constable Anne de Montmorency In April‚ÄìMay 1537, Jean de Lorraine was sent as Ambassador to the Emperor and granted powers to negotiate with him. He returned to Court on 17 May.Catalogue des actes de Fran√ßois Ier Tome IX, p. 42. In accordance with the Concordat of Bologna of 1516, King Francis nominated Jean de Lorraine to the diocese of Lyon in 1537. He took possession of the diocese by procurator on 13 August 1537, and was immediately sent along with the Constable, Anne de Montmorency, on a diplomatic mission to the Emperor to put the final touches on a treaty of peace between France and the Empire. They returned to Narbonne on 13 January 1538, and Montmorency returned to report to the King at the end of January. In May and June the pair were at Nice, engaged in additional negotiations with the Emperor.Catalogue des actes de Fran√ßois Ier Tome IX, p. 43. On his return he resigned the administration of the diocese of Lyon in favor of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, who was appointed by King Francis and whose bulls were dated 29 October 1539. The Cardinal de Lorraine had been Administrator for only two years and two months. The Cardinal de Lorraine travelled with King Francis to Aigues-Mortes for his meeting with the Emperor Charles, which took place between 14 and 17 July 1538, and was present at at least one private meeting. On 14 August 1540 the Cardinal de Lorraine renounced all his interests in the succession to the Duchy of Lorraine in favor of his brother, for a consideration of 50,000 francs.Michon (2003), p. 37 and n. 13. On 22 March 1542, King Francis signed letters ratifying the nomination of the Cardinal de Lorraine as Abbot Commendatory of the Abbey of Blanche-Couronne in Brittany (1542‚Äì1548). A document of 11 April 1544 indicates that the Cardinal was possessed of the Abbeys of F√©camp, Saint-Ouen, Marmoutier, and the Priory of La-Charit√©, from which the King had ordered extraordinary cutting of old-stand trees in their forests for the purpose of building galleys. The Cardinal was instructed to deliver the timber to Rouen at his expense. Patronage Jean de Lorraine, by Cellini The Cardinal was also an open-handed patron of art and learning, as the protector and friend of the humanist scholar Erasmus,Collignon Le M√©c√®nat du cardinal Jean de Lorraine, pp. 11‚Äì36. the poet and translator Cl√©ment Marot, and the satirist Rabelais. It has been argued that the character of Panurge in Gargantua and Pantagruel is based on the Cardinal de Lorraine, and his residence at the H√¥tel de Cluny. In 1527, upon the recommendation and urging of Erasmus, the Cardinal de Lorraine took on Claude Chansonette (Cantiuncula) as his Chancellor. In 1537 Benvenuto Cellini, the Florentine jeweler, sculptor, and medallist, was in Paris, and was commissioned to create several pieces for King Francis I. On one occasion, the King invited Cellini to an after-dinner gathering, at which he found himself in the company of Mme. d'Estampes, the Cardinal de Lorraine, and the King of Navarre and his wife, Marguerite, the sister of King Francis, the Dauphin and the Dauphine.Cellini, Autobiography ¬ß 105; Cellini produced a medal of the Cardinal de Lorraine. The reverse shows the allegorical figure Truth, holding a mirror and a compass, with the legend SIC‚Ä¢ITUR‚Ä¢AD‚Ä¢ASTRA ('This is the way to the stars'). In 1549 at Piacenza (not the Plaisance in the south of France, who seems unacquainted with the clear statement of Thevet himself, √† Plaisance en Italie.) he met the Franciscan Andr√© Thevet, one of the future chaplains of Queen Catherine de' Medici, and encouraged him (par l'autorit√© et faveur duquel, j'ay eu l'opportunit√© de faire le voyage de Ierusalem) to make his journey to the Holy Land and the Levant, which began his career as a cosmographer. Conclave of 1549‚Äì1550 Cardinal Jean de Lorraine participated in the Conclave following the death of Pope Paul III, which began on 29 November 1549. The Cardinal de Guise, Jean de Lorraine's nephew, had been instructed (by the King, it was said) to support the Cardinal de Lorraine, then the Cardinal de Tournon, and any other French cardinals; failing those, he was to work for Salviati, Ridolfi or de Cupis. Ridolfi took himself out of the contest when he died during the Conclave.Petruccelli II, pp. 25‚Äì26. It is recorded that, on the fifteenth Scrutiny on 18 December, even before Guise's arrival, Lorraine had received five votes. Jean de Lorraine, though, did not arrive in the Conclave until 29 December, by which time alliances and antipathies had solidified. In the evening of 7/8 February 1550, Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, aged sixty-three, was elected and chose the throne name Julius III.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1549‚Äì1550.

Other spellings of the name include Ahmed and Ahmet.  Etymology  The word derives from the root (·∏•-m-d), from the Arabic (), from the verb (·∏•amida, \\"to thank or to praise\\"), non-past participle ().  Lexicology  As an Arabic name, it has its origins in a Quranic prophecy attributed to Jesus in the Quran about Muhammad. It also shares the same roots as Mahmud, Muhammad and Hamid. In its transliteration the name has one of the highest number of spelling variations in the world.Humanism, Culture, and Language in the Near East: Asma Afsaruddin, A. H. Mathias Zahniser ‚Äì 1997 p 389 Some Islamic traditions view the name Ahmad as another given name of Muhammad at birth by his mother, considered by Muslims to be the more esoteric name of Muhammad and central to understanding his nature.\\"Muhammad: Prophet of Islam\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 28 September 2009. Retrieved 28 September 2009. Over the centuries, some Islamic scholars have suggested the name's parallel is in the word 'Paraclete' from the Biblical text,Al-MasƒÅq: studia arabo-islamica mediterranea: Volumes 9 √† 10; Volume 9 University of Leeds. Dept. of Modern Arabic Studies, Taylor & Francis ‚Äì 1997 \\"Many Muslim writers, including Ibn Hazm, al-Taban, al-Qurtubi, and Ibn Taymiyya, have identified the Paraclete with Muhammad. Probably the first to do so was his biographer Ibn Ishaq in the mid eighth century.\\"\\"Isa\\", Encyclopedia of IslamWatt (1991) pp. 33‚Äì34 although this view is not universal considering translations, meanings and etymology.Glasse, p. 151.A. Guthrie and E. F. F. Bishop, p. 253‚Äì254. Traditional Islamic sources, such as Sahih al- Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and others contain hadith in which Muhammad personally refers to himself as Ahmad. Islamic scholars such as William Montgomery Watt, however, argue that the use of Ahmad as a proper name for Muhammad did not exist until well into the second Islamic century, previously being used only in an adjectival sense. He concludes that the development of the term being used as a name in reference to Muhammad came later in the context of Christian-Muslim polemics, particularly with Muslim attempts to equate Muhammad with the Biblical 'Paraclete', owing to a prophecy attributed to Jesus in the Quranic verse 61:6.W. Montgomery Watt (1953) ‚ÄòHIS NAME IS AHMAD‚Äô The Muslim World, 43 (2):110‚Äì117 According to the New Encyclopedia of Islam, and the older Encyclopaedia of Islam, the word Ahmad has no etymological attachment to the word Muhammad, but instead has been defined and understood according to its form and likeness to the word Muhammad.  Interpretations and meanings of Ahmad   Development  Regarding Ibn Ishaq's biography of Muhammad, the Sirat Asul Allah, Islamic scholar Alfred Guillaume wrote:  Ahmad passage  Here are three translations of the passage in question in Surat 61 verse 6: The verse in the Quran attributes a name or designation, describing or identifying who would follow Jesus. In his Farewell Discourse to his disciples, Jesus promised that he would \\"send the Holy Spirit\\" to them after his departure, in John 15:26 stating: \\"whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth... shall bear witness of me.\\" John 14:17 states \\"[even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.\\"John by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger 2004 , page 442.The Gospel of John: Question by Question by Judith Schubert 2009 , pages 112‚Äì127. Regarding verse 61: 6 in the Quran: Contrary to the above claim that Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham did not mention Ahmad and the respective passage, there is Ibn Ishaq's work with the title Kitab al-Maghazi and Ibn Hisham who mention and connect the words Mohammad & Ahmad with the Paraclete. Additionally it has been documented that there was an attempt to connect the respective quranic verse with the Paraclete even earlier then Ibn Ishaq. Moreover, a later interpolation of this passage to the Quran, just to serve as an ex eventu prove for the early muslim scholars, has also been refuted in modern Islamic Studies. This is been supported by the fact that the earliest as well as the later manuscripts of the Quran contain the exact passage and wording in Surah 61.  Scholarship regarding the Greek translation  \\"Early translators knew nothing about the surmised reading of periklutos for parakletos, and its possible rendering as Ahmad ‚Ä¶. Periklutos does not come into the picture as far as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham are concerned. The deception is not theirs. The opportunity to introduce Ahmad was not accepted ‚Äì though it is highly improbable that they were aware of it being a possible rendering of Periklutos. It would have clinched the argument to have followed the Johannine references with a Quranic quotation.\\" \\"Furthermore the Peshitta, Old Syriac, and Philoxenian versions all write the name of John in the form Yuhanan, not in the Greek form Yuhannis.. Accordingly to find a text of the Gospels from which Ibn Ishaq could have drawn his quotation we must look for a version which differs from all others in displaying these characteristics. Such a text is the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary of the Gospels which will conclusively prove that the Arabic writer had a Syriac text before him which he, or his informant, skillfully manipulated to provide the reading we have in the Sira.\\".A.

But there are many instances prior to this date of boys called 'Muhammad.' Very rarely is the name 'Ahmad' met with in pre-Islamic time of ignorance (Jahiliya), though the name Muhammad was in common use. Later traditions that the prophet's name was Ahmad show that this had not always been obvious, though commentators assume it after about 22 (AH).\\"W. M. Watt who researched the name \\"Ahmad\\", as quoted by G. Parrinder, Jesus in the Koran, Sheldon Press, pp. 98‚Äì99. \\"It has been concluded that the word Ahmad in Quran as-Saff 61:6 is to be taken not as a proper name but as an adjective... and that it was understood as a proper name only after Muhammad had been identified with the Paraclete.\\"J. Schacht, Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol I, 1960, p. 267. \\"Note that by the middle of the 2nd century AH, Muslims already identified Muhammad with the Greek word \\"Paracletos\\" (Counsellor / Advocate) or the Aramaic translation \\"Menahhemana.\\"New Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol I, 1960.  Historical document regarding the topic  Text of the correspondence between \`Umar II and Leo III: \\"We recognize Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John as the authors of the Gospel, and yet I know that this truth, recognized by us Christians wounds you, so that you seek to find accomplices for your lie. In brief, you admit that we say that it was written by God, and brought down from the heavens, as you pretend for your Furqan, although we know that it was \`Umar, Abu Turab and Salman the Persian, who composed that, even though the rumor has got round among you that God sent it down from heavens‚Ä¶. [God] has chosen the way of sending [the human race] Prophets, and it is for this reason that the Lord, having finished all those things that He had decided on beforehand, and having fore-announced His incarnation by way of His prophets, yet knowing that men still had need of assistance from God, promised to send the Holy Spirit, under the name of Paraclete, (Consoler), to console them in the distress and sorrow they felt at the departure of their Lord and Master. I reiterate, that it was for this cause alone that Jesus called the Holy Spirit the Paraclete, since He sought to console His disciples for His departure, and recall to them all that He had said, all that He had done before their eyes, all that they were called to propagate throughout the world by their witness. Paraclete thus signifies \\"consoler\\", while Muhammad means \\"to give thanks\\", or \\"to give grace\\", a meaning which has no connection whatever with the word Paraclete.\\"Arthur Jeffery.

Transliterations  Ahmad is the most elementary transliteration. It is used commonly all over the Muslim world, although primarily in the Middle East. More recently, this transliteration has become increasingly popular in the United States due to use by members of the African American community. Ahmed is the most common variant transliteration, used especially in the context of the Ottoman Empire. This transliteration is also used throughout the Muslim world. Ahmet is the modern Turkish transliteration. Modern Turkish uses a Latin-based alphabet, and most Arabic-derived names have standardized Turkish spellings. The less common transliterations of Ahmad are used by Muslims outside the Middle East proper, such as in Indonesia and Russia. Achmat is the fairly standard transliteration used by South Africa's Muslim community, and its pronunciation shows evidence of the influence of Afrikaans: the which represents ÿ≠ [ƒß] is pronounced as an Afrikaans [x] (i.e. closer to the Arabic ÿÆ); and the ÿØ [d] is realised as a [t] (closer to the Arabic ÿ™) which follows Afrikaans Final-obstruent devoicing principles.

Imperial Tobacco Canada, the Canadian subsidiary of British American Tobacco, has no relationship to Imperial Tobacco Group plc. History 1901 to 2000 Imperial Tobacco building in Raleigh Road, Bristol, constructed in 1912 The Imperial Tobacco Company was created in 1901 through the amalgamation of 13 British tobacco and cigarette companies: W.D. & H.O. Wills of Bristol (the leading manufacturer of tobacco products at that time), John Player & Sons of Nottingham, and 11 other independent family businesses, which were in competition with companies from the United States by the American Tobacco Company. First W. D. & H. O. Wills of Bristol merged with Stephen Mitchell & Son of Glasgow. Subsequently, other smaller companies including Lambert & Butler, William Clarke & Son, Franklyn Davey, Edwards Ringer & Bigg, Hignett Brothers, Hignett's Tobacco, Adkins & Sons, Richmond Cavendish, D&J; MacDoland, and F&J; Smith joined in the amalgamation. In 1904, James & Finlay Bell Ltd merged with Stephen Mitchell & Son. The Company's first chairman was Sir William Henry Wills, Bt. of the Wills Company. A tin for J&F; Bell \\"Three Nuns\\" tobacco In 1902, the Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company agreed to form a joint venture: the British-American Tobacco Company Ltd. The parent companies agreed not to trade in each other's domestic territory and to assign trademarks, export businesses, and overseas subsidiaries to the joint venture. It built the Imperial Tobacco Company Building at Mullins, South Carolina, between 1908 and 1913. It also established its own leaf-buying organization in the United States through its building, the Imperial Tobacco Warehouse, in Durham, North Carolina, which is now owned, and has been renovated by, Measurement Incorporated. American Tobacco sold its share in 1911, but Imperial maintained an interest in British American Tobacco until 1980. In 1973, the Imperial Tobacco Company, having become increasingly diversified by acquisition of (amongst others) restaurant chains, food services and distribution businesses, changed its name to Imperial Group. In 1910, Imperial Tobacco formed the Imperial Tobacco Company of India. In 1985, the company acquired the Peoples Drugstore chain and all subsidiaries from A. C. Israel.Chain Drug Review, 14 March 1988 \\"Lane being converted to the Peoples name\\" In 1986 the Company was acquired by the conglomerate Hanson Trust plc for ¬£2.5billion.

Patel, the wholesaling arm of Sinclair & Collis to Palmer & Harvey, Imperial Hotels and Catering to Trust House Forte and Ross Frozen Foods to United Biscuits. This also led to a dispute over pension payments to employees, as seen in Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd.[1991] 1 WLR 589 In 1996, following a decision to concentrate on core tobacco activities, Hanson de-merged Imperial and it was listed as an independent company on the UK stock exchange. 2000 to present The Reemtsma head office in Hamburg, Germany, pictured July 2009 In 2003, Imperial acquired the world's then fourth-largest tobacco company, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH of Germany: the deal added brands such as Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant, and West to its portfolio.

A number of factory closures were subsequently announced, including the long-running cigar factory in Bristol. Following the Scottish Parliament's decision in January 2010 to ban the display of tobacco products in shops, as well as the availability of tobacco vending machines in public buildings with effect from autumn 2011, Imperial Tobacco attempted to challenge the change in the law on the grounds that regulations of the sale goods rested with the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. However, this case was dismissed on 30 September 2010 by Lord Bracadale in the Court of Session in Edinburgh. In 2011, Altadis USA Inc. said it would add to its Fort Lauderdale, Florida, headquarters and move Commonwealth Brands Inc. employees from Bowling Green, Kentucky. The company's name changed to Commonwealth-Altadis Inc. In 2013, Imperial opened a new global headquarters in Bristol. In April 2014, Imperial announced the closure of its long-running Horizon factory in Nottingham. The factory closed in 2016, marking the end of cigarette production in England. On 15 July 2014, Reynolds American agreed to buy Greensboro, North Carolina-based Lorillard Tobacco Company, for $27.4 billion. The deal also included the sale of the Kool, Winston, Salem, and blu eCigs brands to Imperial for $7.1 billion. In November 2014, Imperial said Commonwealth-Altadis and the Lorillard operations being acquired would be called ITG Brands LLC. The deal with Lorillard was completed on 12 June 2015, and as part of the deal, Greensboro became the location of the ITG headquarters. On 1 November 2018, ITG announced production would move from the former American Tobacco Company plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, built in 1892 and later expanded, to Greensboro by 2020. The plant made USA Gold, Sonoma, Montclair and Rave.

After searching for a new chairman since February, the company announced its senior independent director Th√©r√®se Esperdy would take the role. In November 2019, Imperial Brands said it would reduce its investment in vaping products for at least the coming year as it reported a decline in underlying earnings.

Typically constructed from earth and either timber or stone, those using the latter material represent the oldest widespread tradition of stone construction in the world. Around 40,000 long barrows survive today. The structures have a long earthen tumulus, or \\"barrow\\", that is flanked on two sides with linear ditches. These typically stretch for between 20 and 70 metres in length, although some exceptional examples are either longer or shorter than this. Some examples have a timber or stone chamber in one end of the tumulus. These monuments often contained human remains interred within their chambers, and as a result, are often interpreted as tombs, although there are some examples where this appears not to be the case. The choice of timber or stone may have arisen from the availability of local materials rather than cultural differences. Those that contained chambers inside of them are often termed chambered long barrows while those which lack chambers are instead called unchambered long barrows or earthen long barrows. The earliest examples developed in Iberia and western France during the mid-fifth millennium BCE. The tradition then spread northwards, into the British Isles and then the Low Countries and southern Scandinavia. Each area developed its own variations of the long barrow tradition, often exhibiting their own architectural innovations. The purpose and meaning of the barrows remains an issue of debate among archaeologists. One argument is that they are religious sites, perhaps erected as part of a system of ancestor veneration or as a religion spread by missionaries or settlers. An alternative explanation views them primarily in economic terms, as territorial markers delineating the areas controlled by different communities as they transitioned toward farming. Communities continued to utilise these long barrows long after their construction. In both the Roman period and the Early Middle Ages, many long barrows were reused as cemeteries. Since the sixteenth century they have attracted interest from antiquarians and archaeologists; it is from the excavations of the latter that our knowledge about them derives. Some have been reconstructed and have become tourist attractions or sacred sites used for rituals by modern Pagan and other religious groups. Terminology and definition In cases such as Kit's Coty House, Kent, the earthen mound of a long barrow has been removed, exposing a stone chamber within. In this case, the surviving chamber represents a trilithon that is commonly called a dolmen. Given their dispersal across Western Europe, long barrows have been given different names in the various different languages of this region. The term barrow is a southern English dialect word for an earthen tumulus, and was adopted as a scholarly term for such monuments by the 17th-century English antiquarian John Aubrey. Synonyms found in other parts of Britain included low in Cheshire, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire, tump in Gloucestershire and Hereford, howe in Northern England and Scotland, and cairn in Scotland. Another term to have achieved international usage has been dolmen, a Breton word meaning \\"table-stone\\"; this is typically used in reference to the stone chambers found in some, although not all, long barrows. The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that such sites could also be termed \\"tomb-shrines\\" to reflect the fact that they appear to have often been used both to house the remains of the dead and to have been used in ritual activities. Some contain no burials while others have been found to contain the remains of up to fifty people. Chambered and earthen The decision as to whether a long barrow used wood or stone appears to have been based largely on the availability of resources. Some of the long barrows contained stone-lined chambers within them. Early 20th-century archaeologists began to call these monuments chambered tombs. The archaeologists Roy and Lesley Adkins referred to these monuments as megalithic long barrows. In most cases, local stone was used where it was available. The style of the chamber falls into two categories. One form, known as grottes sepulchrales artificielles in French archaeology, are dug into the earth. The second form, which is more widespread, are known as cryptes dolmeniques in French archaeology and involved the chamber being erected above ground. Many chambered long barrows contained side chambers within them, often producing a cruciform shape. Others had no such side alcoves; these are known as undifferentiated tombs. Some long barrows do not contain chambers inside of them. John Thurnham termed these \\"unchambered\\" barrows, while the archaeologist Stuart Piggott favoured the term \\"earthen\\" barrows for them. Ian Kinnes instead used the term \\"non-megalithic barrows\\". These long barrows might have used timber because stone was not available. Some classificatory systems, such as that employed by the United Kingdom's National Monuments Record, do not distinguish between the different types of long barrow. The archaeologist David Field noted that drawing typological distinctions on the basis of material used can mask important similarities between different long barrows. Also criticising the focus on classification, the archaeologists Lewis-Williams and Pearce believed that doing so distracted scholars from the task of explaining the meaning and purpose behind the monuments. Design and architecture Long barrows are single mounds, usually of earth, which are flanked by ditches. They are usually between 20 and 70 metres in length, although these are some exceptional examples at either end of this spectrum. The construction of long barrows in the Early Neolithic would have required the co-operation of a number of different individuals and would have represented an important investment in time and resources. They were built without the use of metal tools. There is often regional variation in style and material. In the north and west of Britain, for instance, long barrows often consist of stone mounds containing chambers inside of them, whereas in the south and east of Britain these long barrows are typically made of earth. Many were altered and restyled over their long period of use. Ascertaining at what date a long barrow was constructed is difficult for archaeologists as a result of the various modifications that were made to the monument during the Early Neolithic. Similarly, both modifications and later damage can make it difficult to determine the nature of the original long barrow design. Architecturally, there is much overlap between long barrows and other monument types from Neolithic Europe, such as the bank barrows, cursus monuments, long cairns, and mortuary enclosures. Bank barrows are stylistically similar to the long barrows but are considerably longer. Cursus monuments also exhibit parallel ditches, but also extend over much longer distances than the long barrows. Enviro-archaeological studies have demonstrated that many of the long barrows were erected in wooded landscapes. In Britain, these chambered long barrows are typically located on prominent hills and slopes, in particular being located above rivers and inlets and overlooking valleys. In Britain, long barrows were also often constructed near to causewayed enclosures, a form of earthen monument. Distribution and chronology The distribution of known Early Neolithic long barrows and related funerary monuments Across Europe, about 40,000 long barrows are known to survive from the Early Neolithic. They are found across much of Western Europe; stretching from southeast Spain up to southern Sweden and taking in the British Isles to the west. The long barrows are not the world's oldest known structures using stone‚Äîthey are predated by G√∂bekli Tepe in modern Turkey‚Äîbut they do represent the oldest widespread tradition of using stone in construction. The archaeologist Frances Lynch has described them as \\"the oldest built structures in Europe\\" to survive, while Field noted that they are the earliest monuments surviving in Britain. Although found across this large area, they can be subdivided into clear regionalised traditions based on architectural differences. Excavation has revealed that some of the long barrows in the area of modern Spain, Portugal, and western France were erected in the mid-fifth millennium BCE, making these older than those long barrows further north. Although the general area in which the oldest long barrows were built is therefore known, archaeologists do not know exactly where the tradition started nor which long barrows are the very first ones to have been built. It therefore appears that the architectural tradition developed in this southern area of Western Europe before spreading north, along the Atlantic coast. The tradition had reached Britain by the first half of the fourth millennium BCE, either soon after farming or in some cases perhaps just before it. It later spread further north on mainland Europe, for instance arriving in the Netherlands in the second half of the fourth millennium BCE. Later in the Neolithic, burial practices tended to place greater emphasis on the individual, suggesting a growing social hierarchy and a move away from collective burial. One of the last chambered tombs erected was Bryn Celli Ddu in Anglesey, Wales, built long after people stopped building them across most of Western Europe. The conscious anachronism of the monument led excavators to suggest that its construction was part of a deliberate attempt by people to restore older religious practices that were extinct elsewhere. Hutton suggested that this tradition \\"defines the Early Neolithic of Western Europe\\" more than any other, while the archaeologist David Field described them as \\"among the best known and easily recognised archaeological monuments in the [British] landscape.\\" For the archaeologist Caroline Malone, the long barrows are \\"some of the most impressive and aesthetically distinctive constructions of prehistoric Britain\\". Her fellow archaeologist Frances Lynch stated that these long barrows \\"can still inspire awe, wonder and curiosity even in modern populations familiar with Gothic cathedrals and towering skyscrapers.\\" Regional variation In the area of southern Spain, Portugal, southwestern France, and Brittany, the long barrows typically include large stone chambers. Jacket's Field Long Barrow, one of the earthen long barrows that are clustered around the River Stour in Kent. In Britain, earthen long barrows predominate across much of the southern and eastern parts of the island. Around 300 earthen long barrows are known from across the eastern side of Britain, from Aberdeenshire in the north down to the South Downs in the south, with two projections westward into Dorset and Galloway. Excavation has suggested that these earthen long barrows were likely constructed between 3800 and 3000 BCE. Another prominent regional tradition in Britain is the Cotswold-Severn Group found in the west of the island. These are typically chambered long barrows, and contained human bone in comparatively large quantities, averaging between 40 and 50 people in each. The long barrows found in the Netherlands and northern Germany also used stone in their construction where it was available. The examples of long barrows found in parts of Poland are also typically earthen rather than megalithic. Further north, in Denmark and southern Sweden, the long barrows typically used stone in their construction.  Function  The purpose and meaning of Early Neolithic long barrows are not known, though archaeologists can make suggestions on the basis of recurring patterns that can be observed within the tradition. Archaeologists have not, however, agreed upon the most likely meaning and purpose of these monuments, with various different interpretations being put forward. Lynch suggested that the long barrows likely had \\"broad religious and social roles\\" for the communities who built and used them, comparing them in this way to the churches of medieval and modern Europe. Funerary spaces Many of the long barrows were used as tombs in which to place the remains of deceased individuals. For this reason, archaeologists like Malone have referred to them as \\"houses of the dead\\". Conversely, many of the long barrows do not appear to have been used as tombs; various examples that have been excavated by archaeologists have shown no evidence of having had human remains deposited there. The archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and David Peace, however, noted that these long barrows were more than tombs, also being \\"religious and social foci\\", suggesting that they were places where the dead were visited by the living and where people maintained relationships with the deceased. The Gr√∏nsalen Barrow on the Danish island of M√∏n In some cases, the bones deposited in the chamber may have been old when placed there. In other instances, they may have been placed into the chamber long after the long barrow was built. In some instances, collections of bone originally included in the chamber might have been removed and replaced during the Early Neolithic itself. The human remains placed in long barrows often included a mix of men, women, and children. The bones of various individuals were often mixed together. This may have reflected a desire to obliterate distinctions of wealth and status among the deceased. Not all of those who died in the Early Neolithic were buried in these long barrows, although what criteria was used to determine whose remains were interred there and whose were not remains unknown. Large sections of the Early Neolithic population were not buried in them, although how their bodily remains are dealt with is not clear. It is possible that they were left in the open air. It is also not known where the act of excarnation took place prior to the deposition of bones within the chambers. Some human bones have been found in the ditches of causewayed enclosures, a form of Early Neolithic earthen monument, while evidence for the Early Neolithic outdoor exposure of corpses has also been found at Hambledon Hill. The postholes found in front of many long barrows may also have represented the bases of platforms on which excarnation took place. When entering the chambers to either add or remove new material, individuals would likely have been exposed to the smell of decaying corpses. It is unknown if entering this area was therefore seen by Early Neolithic Europeans as an ordeal to be overcome or an honourable job to be selected for. In some chambers, human remains were arranged and organised according to the type of bone or the age and sex of the individual that they came from, factors that determined which chamber they were placed in. Lynch noted that \\"the bulk of our surviving evidence suggests that collectivity became and remained the norm until the late neolithic\\". Comparatively rarely, grave goods have been found interred alongside human bone inside the long barrows. Where these have been found, archaeologists have typically interpreted them as the remains of funerary ceremonies or of feasts. The choice of grave goods included reflects regional variation. In the Cotswold-Severn Group in southwestern England, cattle bones were commonly found within the chambers, where they had often been treated in a manner akin to the human remains. Sometimes human remains were deposited in the chambers over many centuries. For instance, at West Kennet Long Barrow in Oxfordshire, southern England, the earliest depositions of human remains were radiocarbon dated to the early-to-mid fourth millennium BCE, while a later deposition of human remains was found to belong to the Beaker culture, thus indicating a date in the final centuries of the third millennium BCE; this meant that human remains had been placed into the chamber intermittently over a period of 1500 years. This indicates that some chambered long barrows remained in sporadic use until the Late Neolithic. In various cases, archaeologists have found specific bones absent from the assemblages within the chambers. For instance, at Fussell's Lodge in Wiltshire, southern England, a number of skeletal assemblages were found to be missing not just small bones but also long bones and skulls. It is therefore possible that some bones were deliberately removed from the chambers in the Early Neolithic for use in ritualistic activities. Origins of the design The source of inspiration for the design of the chambered long barrows remains unclear. Suggestions that have proved popular among archaeologists is that they were inspired either by natural rock formations or by the shape of wooden houses. It has been suggested that their design was based on the wooden long houses found in central Europe during the Early Neolithic, however there is a gap of seven centuries between the last known long houses and the first known chambered long barrows. Religious sites According to one possible explanation, the long barrows served as markers of place that were connected to Early Neolithic ideas about cosmology and spirituality, and accordingly were centres of ritual activity mediated by the dead. The inclusion of human remains has been used to argue that these long barrows were involved in a form of ancestor veneration. Malone suggested that the prominence of these barrows suggested that ancestors were deemed far more important to Early Neolithic people than their Mesolithic forebears. In the early twentieth century, this interpretation of the long barrows as religious sites was often connected to the idea that they were the holy sites of a new religion spread by either settlers or missionaries. This explanation has been less popular with archaeologists since the 1970s. Adopting an approach based in cognitive archaeology, Lewis-Williams and Pearce argued that the chambered long barrows \\"reflected and at the same time constituted... a culturally specific expression of the neurologically generated tiered cosmos\\", a cosmos mediated by a system of symbols. They suggested that the entrances to the chambers were viewed as transitional zones where sacrificial rituals took place, and that they were possibly spaces for the transformation of the dead using fire. Territorial markers A second explanation is that these long barrows were intrinsically connected to the transition to farming, representing a new way of looking at the land. In this interpretation, the long barrows served as territorial markers, dividing up the land, signifying that it was occupied and controlled by a particular community, and thus warning away rival groups. In defending this interpretation, Malone noted that each \\"tomb-territory\\" typically had access to a range of soils and landscape types in its vicinity, suggesting that it could have represented a viable territorial area for a particular community. Also supporting this interpretation is the fact that the distribution of chambered long barrows on some Scottish islands shows patterns that closely mirror modern land divisions between farms and crofts. This interpretation also draws ethnographic parallels from recorded communities around the world, who have also used monuments to demarcate territory. This idea became popular among archaeologists in the 1980s and 1990s, and‚Äîin downplaying religion while emphasising an economic explanation for these monuments‚Äîit was influenced by Marxist ideas then popular in the European archaeological establishment. In the early twenty-first century, archaeologists began to challenge this idea, as evidence emerged that much of Early Neolithic Britain was forested and its inhabitants were likely pastoralists rather than agriculturalists. Accordingly, communities in Britain would have been semi-nomadic, with little need for territorial demarcation or clear markings of land ownership. Also, this explanation fails to explain why the chambered long barrows should be clustered in certain areas rather than being evenly distributed throughout the landscape. Later history Many of the chambered long barrows have not remained intact, having been damaged and broken up during the millennia. In some cases, most of the chamber has been removed, leaving only the three-stone dolmen. Iron Age and Roman use Julliberrie's Grave in Kent, southeast England is an unchambered long barrow that saw various inhumation burials and a coin hoard placed around it during the Roman period During the first half of the first millennium BCE, many British long barrows saw renewed human activity. At Julliberrie's Grave in Kent, southeast England, three inhumations were buried at the southern edge of the ditch around the long barrow. The barrow at Wayland's Smithy in Oxfordshire, also in southeast England, saw a cemetery established around the long barrow, with at least 46 skeletons buried in 42 graves, many having been decapitated. 17 Romano-British burials were discovered at Wor Barrow in Dorset, eight of which were missing their heads. The deposition of coins around long barrows also appears to have been quite common in Roman Britain, and these may have been placed by these monuments as offerings. A hoard of Constantinian coins was for instance placed in a pot around Julliberrie's Grave. A solitary coin from the reign of Allectus was found in the ditch around the long barrow at Skendleby I. Antiquarian and archaeological investigation The first serious study of chambered long barrows took place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the mounds that covered chambers were removed by agriculture. By the nineteenth century, antiquarians and archaeologists had come to recognise this style of monument as a form of tomb. In the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, archaeologists like V. Gordon Childe held to the cultural diffusionist view that such Western European monuments had been based on tombs originally produced in parts of the eastern Mediterranean region, suggesting that their ultimate origin was either in Egypt or in Crete. In this view, the tradition was seen as having spread westward as part of some form of \\"megalithic religion\\". A seminal study of the long barrows authored by the Welsh archaeologist Glyn Daniel was published in 1958 as The Megalith Builders of Western Europe. In 1950, Daniel stated that about a tenth of known chambered long barrows in Britain had been excavated, while regional field studies helped to list them. Few of the earlier excavations recorded or retained any human remains found in the chamber. From the 1960s onward, archaeological research increasingly focused on examining regional groups of long barrows rather than the wider architectural tradition. From this decade onward, the meticulous excavation of various long barrows also led to the widespread recognition that long barrows were often multi- phase monuments which had been changed over time. An aerial photograph of the Selsey Long Barrow in Gloucestershire, southwest England Up until the 1970s, archaeologists widely believed that the long barrows of Western Europe were based on Near Eastern models. Archaeological investigation of long barrows has been hindered by the misidentification of other features. Long barrows have been confused with coniger mounds and rabbit warrens, sometimes termed pillow mounds, which can take on a similar shape. Rifle butts can also sometimes take on shapes similar to those of long barrows. Later landscaping has also led to misidentification; the two mounds at Stoke Park in Bristol, southwest England were for instance thought to be long barrows until an excavation in the 1950s revealed that they post-dated the Middle Ages, and thus must have been created by more recent landscaping projects. In areas which were previously impacted by glaciation, moraine deposits on valley floors have sometimes been mistaken for long barrows. At Dunham New Park in Cheshire, northwest England, for instance, a mound was initially believed to be a long barrow and only later assessed as a natural feature. Damage sustained by Neolithic long barrows can also lead to them being mistaken for other types of monuments, such as the oval barrows and round barrows which are usually of later date. Aerial photography has proven useful in identifying many more examples that are barely visible on the ground. Recent activity  Long barrows such as West Kennet Long Barrow in Wiltshire have become tourist attractions. At Wayland's Smithy in Oxfordshire, visitors have lodged coins into cracks in the site's stones since at least the 1960s, while at the Coldrum Long Barrow in Kent, a rag tree has been established overhanging the barrow. Many modern Pagans view West Kennet Long Barrow as a \\"temple\\" and use it for their rituals. Some see it as a place of the ancestors where they can engage in \\"vision quests\\" and other neo-shamanic practices. Others have seen it as a womb of the Great Goddess, and as a sort of living entity. The winter solstice has been a particularly popular occasion for Pagans to visit. In 2015 the first long barrow in thousands of years, the Long Barrow at All Cannings, inspired by those built in the Neolithic era, was built on land just outside the village of All Cannings in Wiltshire. This was followed soon after by others, such as Soulton Long Barrow near Wem, Shropshire.

The libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini survives complete; the mostly-lost music was completed by Jacopo Peri, but at least two of the six surviving fragments are by Jacopo Corsi. Dafne was first performed during Carnival of 1598 (1597 old style) at the Palazzo Corsi.Edmond Strainchamps, \\"Corsi, Jacopo\\" in New Grove. History Dafne is scored for a much smaller ensemble than Claudio Monteverdi's slightly later operas, namely, a harpsichord, a lute, a viol, an archlute, and a triple flute. Drawing on a new development at the time, Peri established recitatives, melodic speech set to music, as a central part of opera.Jacopo Peri ‚Äì Dafne page The story of Apollo falling in love with the eponymous nymph, Daphne, the opera was written for an elite circle of humanists in Florence, the Florentine Camerata, between 1594 and 1597, with the support, and possibly the collaboration, of the composer and patron Jacopo Corsi. An attempt to revive Greek drama, according to modern scholarship, it was a long way off from what the ancient Greeks would have recognized. Most of Peri's music has been lost, despite its popularity and fame in Europe at the time of its composition, but the 455 line verse libretto was published and survives. Florence's ruling Medici family was sufficiently taken with Dafne to allow Peri's next work, Euridice, to be performed as part of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV's wedding celebrations in 1600.

Guy, two other close associates of Gardner, to co-author the book Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays, leading to his recognition as one of the founders of combinatorial game theory.The Mathematical Legacy of Martin Gardner by Elwyn Berlekamp, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), September 2, 2014: Partly because of what I had read about them in Martin Gardner‚Äôs columns, I was appropriately awestruck in the 1960s when I first met Sol Golomb and then Richard Guy, each of whom had a large influence on my subsequent work. In 1969 Richard introduced me to John Horton Conway, and the three of us immediately began collaborating on a book that eventually became Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays. In the 1970s, I joined Conway in some of his many visits to Gardner‚Äôs home on Euclid Avenue, in Hastings-on- Hudson, New York. Gardner soon became an enthusiastic advocate of our book project, and he previewed various snippets of it in his Scientific American columns. The dedication of their book says, \\"To Martin Gardner, who has brought more mathematics to more millions than anyone else.\\"Berlekamp, Elwyn R., John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy (1982).

Located on the western side of the city's central business district, the complex served as a maritime industrial area in the early and mid 20th century. It was redeveloped as part of extensive urban renewal projects around Sydney Harbour in the 1980s and 90s. The complex is host to a cluster of nine wharves, with the first two wharves currently in use by private ferry operator Captain Cook Cruises and a third recently decommissioned by Sydney Ferries. Description King Street Wharf is adjacent to the Darling Harbour tourist precinct, and on the western edge of Sydney's central business district. The residential towers occupy the area bounded by King Street to the South, Shelley Street to the East, Erskine Street to the North and Lime Street to the West. Ranging in height from 8 to 14 stories consisting of: *155 residential apartments in the North Tower *107 residential apartments in the South Tower *95 residential apartments in 45 - 49 Shelley Street. *114 Serviced Apartments - Medina The commercial waterfront is between Lime Street and Darling Harbour, and extends slightly north of the end of Erskine Street. It consists of 85 commercial suites with a retail component set underneath. This retail area contains 11 restaurants, the largest of which seats 450 including its outdoor areas. Developments Under Walker Corporation Limited, the retail and restaurants, stages of residential and serviced apartments and commercial/retail strata suites were completed. The remainder of the development parcels are still being developed by Brookfield Multiplex Limited. They include the completed KPMG Headquarters, American Express House, Ibis Hotel, Macquarie Bank headquarters and One Shelley Street office building. The remaining development will consist of further commercial and retail and public parking expected to be completed over the next few years. It also involves associated infrastructure such as roadworks, car parking, charter vessel berthing facilities and coach parking. Wharves Wharf 1 Wharf 1 is currently used by Captain Cook Cruises as a stop on their Darling Harbour Circular Quay service, badged as \\"CCDH\\" by Transport for NSW. The wharf is serviced by 22 CCDH daily services on weekdays, and 23 daily services on weekends and public holidays on looping stopping patterns originating from Harbour Master Steps ferry wharf and terminating at Circular Quay ferry wharf. An additional morning service on weekends originates from the Pier 26 ferry wharf. Wharf 2 Wharf 2 is currently used by Captain Cook Cruises as the terminus of their Darling Harbour to Manly shuttle service, badged as \\"CCDM\\" by Transport for New South Wales. Seventeen CCDM services to Manly Wharf depart from Wharf 2 daily on weekdays, with seven departures on weekends and public holidays.

He was highly respected by Sri Lankan Buddhists, who believe that he achieved a higher level of spiritual development through meditation. Sri Lankan Buddhists also considered Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero as a Bodhisattva, who will attain Buddhahood in a future life. Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero lived a modest life and did a great service for the propagation of Buddhist philosophy. In recognition of his valuable service at the Sixth Buddhist council held in Burma, the Burmese government conferred on him the title \\"Agga Mahapandita\\" (Chief Great Scholar) in 1956. Later in March 1997, the Burmese government conferred on Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero the highest Sangha title, \\"Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru\\" (Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher), which is equivalent to Sangharaja, in honor of his unique service to the Buddhist religion. Biography Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero was born on 23 August 1896 in Kirindigala, Balangoda, to the family of N. A. Matthias Appuhamy (Maddumahamy) and B. Heenmanike. His birth name was Punchi Mahattaya aka William. Because Punchi Mahattaya's mother died when he was 14 days old, he was brought up by his father's brother and his wife. Punchi Mahattaya had his primary education at Kumara Vidyalaya, Balangoda. At the age of 15 he had decided to enter the order of Buddhist monks and was ordained as a Samanera at the temple Sri Nandaramaya, Udumulla, Balangoda on 2 March 1911. He was ordained under the guidance of Daamahana Dhammananda Thero and Deniyaye Seelananda Thero was his primary teacher (Upaadhyaayanwahanse). Balangdoda Ananda Maitreya Thero received his Upasampada on 14 July 1916 at Olu Gantota Udakukhepa Seema, Balangoda. Thero continued his studies after becoming a monk and later became a scholar in Buddhism and languages. Thero entered Ananda College, Colombo in 1919 and became a teacher of the same school in 1922. Unusually for a Theravada teacher, he publicly studied some other traditions, such as Mahayana Buddhism, mantra and esoteric yoga. This is understandable when one realizes that he was a theosophist as well as a Buddhist. He was a self learner in most of his areas of studies. Ananda Maitreya Thero was the first Dharmarcharya (teacher of Buddhism) at Nalanda College Colombo, when it was first established in 1925. It was Thero who named it 'Nalanda' and chose Apadana Sobhini Panna meaning wisdom beautifies character as Nalanda College's motto, which is still being used. Later he became the professor of Mahayana Buddhism at Vidyodaya University, Sri Lanka. He was appointed to the post of Dean, Faculty of Buddhist Studies in 1963. On 1 October 1966, he was appointed to the post of Vice Chancellor at the same university. Ananda Maithreya Thero's first overseas Dhamma journey was to Kerala, India in 1926. He opened the Sri Dhammananda Pirivena, Colombo in 1930. On 18 January 1954, Thero was appointed to the post of Sangha Nayaka of Sabaragamu-Saddhammawansa Nikaya and in the same year he participated in the Sixth Buddhist council held in Myanmar. On 2 September 1969, Ananda Maitreya Thero was appointed as the President of Amarapura Sangha SabhƒÅ of Sri Lanka. Ananda Maitreya Thero was famous for his achievements in Buddhist meditation. He was known to have practiced both Samatha meditation and Vipassana meditation to a great extent and was considered to be having a highly developed mind through his meditation. Many Buddhists have experienced his powerful spiritual blessings in many more ways than one. His teachings and life have been an inspiration to many aspiring monks and lay followers. Ananda Maitreya Thero along with Narada Thero and Madihe Pannaseeha Thero was and still is one of the foremostly revered and respected Buddhist monks of the twentieth century in Sri Lanka. His work and sacrifices with Anagarika Dharmapala was one of the steering forces of the upholding of Buddhism in Sri Lanka at one stage. Thero also traveled to many countries in the world for the propagation of Buddhism. Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero died at 11.40 p.m. on 18 July 1998 at the age of 101. Degrees and titles Ananda Maitreya Thero at the 6th Buddhist council held in Burma In 1955, the Government of Myanmar (then Burma) conferred him the title Agga Maha Pandita (Great Chief Scholar) to honour his unprecedented service at the Sixth Buddhist council. To honor his unique service to the Buddha ≈öƒÅsana, Myanmar also conferred him the highest Sangha title, Abhidhaja Maharatthaguru (Most Eminent Great Spiritual Teacher), which is equivalent to Sangharaja in 1997. Ananda Maithreya Thero received the Thripitaka Vaagishwaracharya Pravachana Visharada Raajakeeya Panditha honorary degree from the Government of Sri Lanka. In addition to that, Nayaka Thero has received two honorary titles, Saahithyasuuri from Vidyodaya University and Saahithya Chakrawarthi from Vidyalankara University. The humbleness of Maha Nayaka Thero's character is clearly shown, when he publicly stated that he had no liking whatsoever for titles and awards, but that he was rather accepting it to satisfy the presenter. He quoted Lord Buddha in his speech saying \\"I often remind myself of My Great Buddha's preaching in the Sanyuktha nikaya or the Abhidhamma Pitaka of the worthlessness and futileness of the craving for awards, titles and commanding positions\\". Survey of writings Ananda Maitreya Thero wrote nearly fifty books on sutras (scripture), vinaya (monastic discipline), on abhidhamma (metaphysics), and on Pali and Sanskrit grammar. His book, Sakyasimhavadanaya hevat Buddha Charita (The Life of the Buddha), is considered as a textbook. Most of his books are written in English and Sinhala languages. *Meditation on breathing *Easy steps to English *Life of the Buddha *Bhavana Deepaniya *Sambodhi Prarthana *A Hand Book of Spoken English *Dhamsabhava *Sathara Paramarthaya *Buddha Dharmaya *Vidharshana Bhavanava *Meditation Sur La Respiration *Maithree Bhavanava *Anaphana Sathi Bhavanava *Shamatha Bhavanava *Udanaya Ananda Maitreya Thero translation of the Dhammapada is published internationally. * The Dhammapada: The Path of Truth: Softcover, Wisdom Pubns, References Further reading * Dhammalankara, Iththapane.

Rigour frequently refers to a process of adhering absolutely to certain constraints, or the practice of maintaining strict consistency with certain predefined parameters. These constraints may be environmentally imposed, such as \\"the rigours of famine\\"; logically imposed, such as mathematical proofs which must maintain consistent answers; or socially imposed, such as the process of defining ethics and law.  Etymology  Rigour comes to English through old French (13th c., Modern French rigueur) meaning \\"stiffness\\", which itself is based on the Latin rigorem (nominative rigor) \\"numbness, stiffness, hardness, firmness; roughness, rudeness\\", from the verb rigere \\"to be stiff\\". The noun was frequently used to describe a condition of strictness or stiffness, which arises from a situation or constraint either chosen or experienced passively. For example, the title of the book Theologia Moralis Inter Rigorem et Laxitatem Medi roughly translates as \\"mediating theological morality between rigour and laxness\\". The book details, for the clergy, situations in which they are obligated to follow church law exactly, and in which situations they can be more forgiving yet still considered moral. Rigor mortis translates directly as the stiffness (rigor) of death (mortis), again describing a condition which arises from a certain constraint (death).  Intellectual rigour  Intellectual rigour is a process of thought which is consistent, does not contain self-contradiction, and takes into account the entire scope of available knowledge on the topic. It actively avoids logical fallacy. Furthermore, it requires a sceptical assessment of the available knowledge. If a topic or case is dealt with in a rigorous way, it typically means that it is dealt with in a comprehensive, thorough and complete way, leaving no room for inconsistencies. Scholarly method describes the different approaches or methods which may be taken to apply intellectual rigour on an institutional level to ensure the quality of information published. An example of intellectual rigour assisted by a methodical approach is the scientific method, in which a person will produce a hypothesis based on what they believe to be true, then construct experiments in order to prove that hypothesis wrong. This method, when followed correctly, helps to prevent against circular reasoning and other fallacies which frequently plague conclusions within academia. Other disciplines, such as philosophy and mathematics, employ their own structures to ensure intellectual rigour. Each method requires close attention to criteria for logical consistency, as well as to all relevant evidence and possible differences of interpretation. At an institutional level, Peer review is used to validate intellectual rigour.  Intellectual honesty  Intellectual rigour is a subset of intellectual honesty‚Äîa practice of thought in which ones convictions are kept in proportion to valid evidence.Wiener, N. (1985). Intellectual honesty and the contemporary scientist. In P. Masani (Ed.), Norbert Wiener: Collected works and commentary (pp. 725‚Äì729). Intellectual honesty is an unbiased approach to the acquisition, analysis, and transmission of ideas. A person is being intellectually honest when he or she, knowing the truth, states that truth, regardless of outside social/environmental pressures. It is possible to doubt whether complete intellectual honesty exists‚Äîon the grounds that no one can entirely master his or her own presuppositions‚Äîwithout doubting that certain kinds of intellectual rigour are potentially available. The distinction certainly matters greatly in debate, if one wishes to say that an argument is flawed in its premises.  Politics and law  The setting for intellectual rigour does tend to assume a principled position from which to advance or argue. An opportunistic tendency to use any argument at hand is not very rigorous, although very common in politics, for example. Arguing one way one day, and another later, can be defended by casuistry, i.e. by saying the cases are different. In the legal context, for practical purposes, the facts of cases do always differ. Case law can therefore be at odds with a principled approach; and intellectual rigour can seem to be defeated. This defines a judge's problem with uncodified law. Codified law poses a different problem, of interpretation and adaptation of definite principles without losing the point; here applying the letter of the law, with all due rigour, may on occasion seem to undermine the principled approach.  In specific disciplines  Mathematical rigour can refer both to rigorous methods of mathematical proof and to rigorous methods of mathematical practice (thus relating to other interpretations of rigour).  Mathematical proof  Mathematical rigour is often cited as a kind of gold standard for mathematical proof. Its history traces back to Greek mathematics, especially to Euclid's Elements. Until the 19th century, the treatise was seen as extremely rigorous and profound, but in the late 19th century, Hilbert (among others) realized that the work left certain assumptions implicit‚Äîassumptions that could not be proved from Euclid's Axioms (e.g. two circles can intersect in a point, some point is within an angle, and figures can be superimposed on each other).For more, see Euclidean geometry ‚Äî 19th century and non-Euclidean geometry. This was contrary to the idea of rigorous proof where all assumptions need to be stated and nothing can be left implicit. New foundations were developed using the axiomatic method to address this gap in rigour found in the Elements (e.g., Hilbert's axioms, Birkhoff's axioms, Tarski's axioms). During the 19th century, the term 'rigorous' began to be used to describe increasing levels of abstraction when dealing with calculus which eventually became known as mathematical analysis. The works of Cauchy added rigour to the older works of Euler and Gauss. The works of Riemann added rigour to the works of Cauchy. The works of Weierstrass added rigour to the works of Riemann, eventually culminating in the arithmetization of analysis. Starting in the 1870s, the term gradually came to be associated with Cantorian set theory. Mathematical rigour can be modelled as amenability to algorithmic proof checking. Indeed, with the aid of computers, it is possible to check some proofs mechanically.Hardware memory errors are caused by high-energy radiation from outer space, and can generally be expected to affect one bit of data per month, per gigabyte of DRAM.. Formal rigour is the introduction of high degrees of completeness by means of a formal language where such proofs can be codified using set theories such as ZFC (see automated theorem proving). Published mathematical arguments have to conform to a standard of rigour, but are written in a mixture of symbolic and natural language. In this sense, written mathematical discourse is a prototype of formal proof. Often, a written proof is accepted as rigorous although it might not be formalised as yet. The reason often cited by mathematicians for writing informally is that completely formal proofs tend to be longer and more unwieldy, thereby obscuring the line of argument. An argument that appears obvious to human intuition may in fact require fairly long formal derivations from the axioms. In short, comprehensibility is favoured over formality in written discourse. Still, advocates of automated theorem provers may argue that the formalisation of proof does improve the mathematical rigour by disclosing gaps or flaws in informal written discourse. When the correctness of a proof is disputed, formalisation is a way to settle such a dispute as it helps to reduce misinterpretations or ambiguity.  Physics  The role of mathematical rigour in relation to physics is twofold: # First, there is the general question, sometimes called Wigner's Puzzle,This refers to the 1960 paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences by Eugene Wigner. \\"how it is that mathematics, quite generally, is applicable to nature?\\" However, scientists believe that its record of successful application to nature justifies the study of mathematical physics. # Second, there is the question regarding the role and status of mathematically rigorous results and relations. This question is particularly vexing in relation to quantum field theory, where computations often produce infinite values for which a variety of non-rigorous work-arounds have been devised. Both aspects of mathematical rigour in physics have attracted considerable attention in philosophy of science (see, for example, ref.Davey, Kevin, ‚ÄùIs Mathematical Rigor Necessary in Physics?‚Äù, The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 54 (2003) 439‚Äì463. and ref.Gelfert, Axel, ‚ÄùMathematical Rigor in Physics: Putting Exact Results in Their Place‚Äù, Philosophy of Science, 72 (2005) 723‚Äì738. and the works quoted therein).  Education  Rigour in the classroom is a hotly debated topic amongst educators. Generally speaking, however, classroom rigour consists of multi-faceted, challenging instruction and correct placement of the student. Students excelling in formal operational thought tend to excel in classes for gifted students. Students who have not reached that final stage of cognitive development, according to developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, can build upon those skills with the help of a properly trained teacher. Rigour in the classroom is commonly referred to as rigorous instruction. It is instruction that requires students to construct meaning for themselves, impose structure on information, integrate individual skills into processes, operate within but at the outer edge of their abilities, and apply what they learn in more than one context and to unpredictable situations Jackson, R. (2011). How to Plan Rigorous Instruction. Alexandria, VA.: ASCD.

The band consisted of Brett Anderson (lead vocals), Allison Robertson (guitar, backing vocals), Maya Ford (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Amy Cesari (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Cesari replaced Torry Castellano, who left the band in 2009 due to tendonitis. They drew inspiration from the Ramones, The Runaways, Girlschool, AC/DC, Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive and Kiss. Rolling Stone has stated that \\"the Donnas offer a guileless take on adolescent alienation; they traffic in kicks, not catharsis, fun rather than rage\\". MTV has stated that the band offers \\"a good old-fashioned rock & roll party\\". After gathering a cult following in the punk scene since their 1997 debut, the band achieved major label commercial success in the early 2000s and afterward as their music mixed punk, metal and classic rock sounds. History Origins and early years: 1993-2001 All the founding band members were born in 1979; Brett Anderson (vocals) on May 30; Allison Robertson (guitar and vocals) on August 26; and Maya Ford (bass guitar and vocals) and Torry Castellano (drums, percussion, vocals), both on January 8. They all became friends by eighth grade and formed as a band in May 1993 to play for their school's \\"Day on the Green.\\" One of two all-female bands in their town Palo Alto, California, they were relatively unknown until they were out of high school. They are all self-taught musicians and practiced in Castellano's garage nearly every day during their years at Palo Alto High School. They called themselves \\"Ragady Anne\\" in their early days and shortly thereafter changed their name to \\"The Electrocutes\\". Towards the end of their high school days, while they were still known as The Electrocutes, they decided to create another band (with the same members) that would play softer tunes without distorting the metal queen image of The Electrocutes. To help their fans distinguish between the two bands, they all took matching \\"Donna\\" monikers, where all of their names were Donna and their last names were the first initial of their last name (Brett Anderson became Donna A, etc.), which they used only when performing as \\"The Donnas.\\" They worked with producer Darin Raffaelli for their first two albums, the first of which, simply called The Donnas, was released on Raffaelli's Super*teem! record label. (It was later released again on Lookout! Records.) They took a week off their senior year of high school to tour Japan as The Donnas, and were promoted and organized by Pinky Aoki a.k.a. The Phantomgift. Afterwards, they signed with Lookout! Records. As the band grew, they were urged to sign with a major label company. In December 2001, they signed with Atlantic Records. Atlantic Records: 2002-2005 In 2002, The Donnas released Spend the Night as their Atlantic debut. The album represented their first attempt at mainstream success. With their single \\"Take it Off\\" they were booked for appearances on Total Request Live, Saturday Night Live, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and the Late Show with David Letterman. In the summer of 2003, they played the main stage at Lollapalooza. In 2004, they released their sixth album Gold Medal. In February 2005, they toured Australia with the Big Day Out music festival, playing from Sydney to Perth. While in Australia they performed \\"Take It Off\\" live on national prime-time show \\"Rove Live\\" with Rove McManus. Atlantic repeatedly placed the Donnas' music in video game soundtracks. \\"You've Got a Crush On Me\\" can be heard in the PlayStation 2 game Splashdown. \\"Who Invited You\\" can be found on the soundtracks for True Crime: Streets of LA and MVP Baseball 2003 as well as Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild. \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" is in the Gran Turismo 4 soundtrack also and a cover of the song was also used for Donkey Konga 2 for the Nintendo GameCube. \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" was also used as the theme song for the first season of The-N's hit series, \\"South of Nowhere\\". A cover of \\"Take it Off\\" is featured in Guitar Hero and added as a downloadable track in Guitar Hero 2 on the Xbox 360 (released in 2006) and Downhill Domination (released in 2004). Rock Band 2 (for the PS3, Xbox 360 & Wii), released by Harmonix in 2008, features the track \\"New Kid In School\\" which was released exclusively on Apples iTunes service. \\"Fall Behind Me\\" was also used in a national television commercial advertising the Nissan Xterra while Take It Off was used in a Budweiser commercial. Atlantic also energetically marketed the Donnas through placements in numerous film soundtracks. The band appeared in the movie Drive Me Crazy in 1999 (as The Electrocutes), and later on the TV show Charmed performing the single \\"Fall Behind Me\\" at P3. They also appeared in the 1999 teen comedy Jawbreaker as the prom band, contributing two songs to the soundtrack (\\"Rock 'N' Roll Machine\\" and \\"Checkin' It Out\\"). A cover of \\"Roll On Down The Highway\\" was used in the Disney comedy film Herbie: Fully Loaded and Backstage was used in \\"Freaky Friday\\". The Donnas can also be heard on Mean Girls during the end credits playing a cover of the Billy Idol song \\"Dancing With Myself\\", and they also contributed to the soundtrack of the movie Grind. The video \\"Too Bad About Your Girl\\" also features the cast of that film. The song \\"Take It Off\\" features in the movie Dodgeball. The song \\"Take Me To The Backseat\\" can be heard in the action comedy film 2004 D.E.B.S.. A cover version of the Kiss song \\"Strutter\\" was used in the soundtrack to the 1999 movie Detroit Rock City (film). \\"Please Don't Tease\\" was used in \\"New York Minute\\" and \\"Everyone Is Wrong \\" was featured in the movie \\"Elektra\\". Then Guitar Hero used \\"Take It Off\\" for 2009 Guitar Hero Smash Hits. \\"Take It Off\\" was also used in the 2009 hit movie The Hangover. \\"Play My Game\\" was featured in a Season 1 episode of What's New, Scooby Doo?. \\"Who Invited You\\" is featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie What a Girl Wants. New label and line-up change: 2006-present Performing in 2008 On May 19, 2006 The Donnas announced on their public message board that they had \\"parted ways with Atlantic Records,\\" claiming \\"[t]he decision was entirely mutual and completely amicable and will not impact the band, nor will it impact upon the writing, recording or touring for the next Donnas album.\\" In March 2007, the Donnas released a single, \\"Don't Wait Up For Me,\\" and had a new band logo designed. The Donnas independently released their seventh studio album titled Bitchin on September 18, 2007 Purple Feather Records label. Bitchin was produced by Jay Ruston and The Donnas and contained the single \\"Don't Wait Up For Me\\". In 2008 The Donnas toured with the Melbourne-based, Australian band Kisschasy as part of their Skin and Bones tour. They also toured the U.S. and Canada with The Hives. In July 2009, the band released a retrospective collection entitled Greatest Hits Vol. 16 to celebrate the band's 16th year together. The album contains new songs, re-recorded older songs as well as some unreleased material. The band toured that summer with Pat Benatar and Blondie on the two's joint Call Me Invincible Tour. Drummer Torry Castellano was unable to play on any of these tour dates as she was suffering from tendonitis of the shoulder, which was accredited to the fact that as a self-taught drummer she had held the drumsticks incorrectly (even though it felt right to her) and sustained long term damage over time. Long-time friend Amy Cesari of the band The Demonics has been chosen to fill in for Castellano. On July 9, 2010, Castellano announced via the band's website that due to her continued shoulder problems she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. She returned to school at Santa Monica College and then Stanford University, where she graduated in 2013 and went on to Harvard Law School. In August 2012, the band was reported to be recording their eighth studio album and also premiered a new song called \\"Tramp\\" at a recent private show. In November 2016 Cherry Red Records re-released the band's fifth album, Spend the Night, to include six bonus tracks which consist of B-sides and songs from previous albums.

Clifford Geertz by His Colleagues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. He served until his death as professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Life and career Geertz was born in San Francisco on August 23, 1926. After service in the US Navy in World War II (1943‚Äì45), Geertz received his B.A. in philosophy from Antioch College in 1950. He would then attend Harvard University, graduating in 1956 as a student in the Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary program led by Talcott Parsons. As such, Geertz would work with Parsons, as well as Clyde Kluckhohn, training as an anthropologist. Geertz would conduct his first long-term fieldwork together with his wife, Hildred, in Java, Indonesia, a project funded by the Ford Foundation and MIT. He would also study the religious life of a small, upcountry town for two-and-a-half years, living with a railroad laborer's family.Geertz, Clifford. 2001. Available Light: Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics. Princeton: Princeton University Press. After finishing his thesis, Geertz returned to Indonesia, in Bali and Sumatra, after which he would receive his Ph.D. in 1956 with a dissertation entitled Religion in Modjokuto: A Study of Ritual Belief In A Complex Society. Throughout his life, Geertz received honorary doctorate degrees from around fifteen colleges and universities, including Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Chicago; as well as awards such as the Association for Asian Studies' (AAS) 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies.Association for Asian Studies (AAS), 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies; retrieved 2011-05-31 Following his divorce from anthropologist Hildred Geertz, his first wife, he would marry Karen Blu, another anthropologist.  Teaching  He taught or held fellowships at a number of schools before joining the faculty of the anthropology department at the University of Chicago in 1960. In this period Geertz expanded his focus on Indonesia to include both Java and Bali and produced three books, including Religion of Java (1960), Agricultural Involution (1963), and Peddlers and Princes (also 1963). In the mid-1960s, he shifted course and began a new research project in Morocco that resulted in several publications, including Islam Observed (1968), which compared Indonesia and Morocco. In 1970, Geertz left Chicago to become professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey from 1970 to 2000, then as emeritus professor. In 1973, he published The Interpretation of Cultures, which collected essays Geertz had published throughout the 1960s. That became Geertz's best-known book and established him not just as an Indonesianist but also as an anthropological theorist. In 1974, he edited the anthology Myth, Symbol, Culture that contained papers by many important anthropologists on symbolic anthropology. Geertz produced ethnographic pieces in this period, such as Kinship in Bali (1975), Meaning and Order in Moroccan Society (1978; written collaboratively with Hildred Geertz and Lawrence Rosen) and Negara (1981). Later life From the 1980s to his death, Geertz wrote more theoretical and essayistic pieces, including book reviews for the New York Review of Books. As a result, most of his books of the period are collections of essays‚Äîbooks including Local Knowledge (1983), Available Light (2000), and Life Among The Anthros (2010), which was published posthumously. He would also produced a series of short essays on the stylistics of ethnography in Works and Lives (1988), while other works include the autobiographical After The Fact (1995). Geertz conducted extensive ethnographic research in Southeast Asia and North Africa. This fieldwork was the basis of Geertz's famous analysis of the Balinese cockfight among others. While holding a position in Chicago in the 1960s, he would be director of a multidisciplinary project titled Committee for the Comparative Studies of New Nations. As part of the project, Geertz conducted fieldwork in Morocco on \\"bazaars, mosques, olive growing and oral poetry,\\" collecting ethnographic data that would be used for his famous essay on thick description.Geertz, Clifford. 1973. \\"Thick Description: Towards an Interpretive Theory of Culture.\\" Pp. 3‚Äì30 in The Interpretation of Cultures. New York: Basic Books. Geertz contributed to social and cultural theory and is still influential in turning anthropology toward a concern with the frames of meaning within which various peoples live their lives. He reflected on the basic core notions of anthropology, such as culture and ethnography. He would eventually die of complications following heart surgery on October 30, 2006. At the time of his death, Geertz was working on the general question of ethnic diversity and its implications in the modern world.  Main ideas, contributions, and influences  Geertz's often-cited essay \\"Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight\\" is a classic example of thick description, a concept adopted from the British philosopher Gilbert Ryle which comes from ordinary language philosophy. Thick description is an anthropological method of explaining with as much detail as possible the reason behind human actions.Ryle, Gilbert. 1996 [1968]. \\"The Thinking of Thoughts: What is 'Le Penseur' Doing?.\\" Studies in Anthropology 11. UK: Centre for Social Anthropology and Computing, University of Kent. Archived from the original on 2014-12-21. . Many human actions can mean many different things, and Geertz insisted that the anthropologist needs to be aware of this. The work proved influential amongst historians, many of whom tried to use these ideas about the 'meaning' of cultural practice in the study of customs and traditions of the past. Another of Geertz's philosophical influences is that of Ludwig Wittgenstein's post-analytic philosophy, from which Geertz incorporates the concept of family resemblances into anthropology. Geertz would also introduce anthropology to the \\"umwelt-mitwelt- vorwelt-folgewelt\\" formulation of Alfred Sch√ºtz's phenomenology,Geertz, Clifford. 1993 [1973]. The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays. London: Fontana Press. stressing that the links between the \\"consociate,\\" \\"contemporary,\\" \\"predecessor,\\" and \\"successor\\" that are commonplace in anthropology derive from this very formulation. At the University of Chicago, Geertz became a champion of symbolic anthropology, a framework which gives prime attention to the role of symbols in constructing public meaning. In his seminal work The Interpretation of Cultures (1973), Geertz outlined culture as \\"a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life.\\" He was one of the earliest scholars to see that the insights provided by common language, philosophy and literary analysis could have major explanatory force in the social sciences. Geertz aimed to provide the social sciences with an understanding and appreciation of ‚Äúthick description.‚Äù Geertz applied thick description to anthropological studies, particularly to his own 'interpretive anthropology', urging anthropologists to consider the limitations placed upon them by their own cultural cosmologies when attempting to offer insight into the cultures of other people. He produced theory that had implications for other social sciences; for example, Geertz asserted that culture was essentially semiotic in nature, and this theory has implications for comparative political sciences. Max Weber and his interpretative social science are strongly present in Geertz‚Äôs work. Drawing from Weber, Geertz himself argues for a ‚Äúsemiotic‚Äù concept of culture:Geertz, Clifford. 1973. The Interpretation of Cultures. New York: Basic Books. > Believing‚Ä¶that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself > has spun‚Ä¶I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be > therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretative > one in search of meaning. It is explication I am after, construing social > expression on their surface enigmatical. (p.5) Geertz argues that to interpret a culture‚Äôs web of symbols, scholars must first isolate its elements, specifying the internal relationships among those elements and characterize the whole system in some general way according to the core symbols around which it is organized, the underlying structures of which it is a surface expression, or the ideological principles upon which it is based. It was his view that culture is public, because ‚Äúmeaning is,‚Äù and systems of meanings are what produce culture, because they are the collective property of a particular people. We cannot discover the culture‚Äôs import or understand its systems of meaning, when, as Wittgenstein noted, ‚Äúwe cannot find our feet with them.‚Äù Geertz wants society to appreciate that social actions are larger than themselves: > It is not against a body of uninterrupted data, radically thinned > descriptions, that we must measure the cogency of our explications, but > against the power of the scientific imagination to bring us into touch with > the lives of strangers.‚Äù In seeking to converse with subjects in foreign cultures and gain access to their conceptual world, this is the goal of the semiotic approach to culture. Cultural theory is not its own master; at the end of the day we must appreciate, that the generality ‚Äúthick description‚Äù contrives to achieve, grows out of the delicacy of its distinctions, not the sweep of its abstraction. The essential task of theory-building here is not to codify abstract regularities, but to make thick description possible; not to generalize across cases, but to generalize within them. Cockfight in Bali During Geertz's long career he worked through a variety of theoretical phases and schools of thought. He would reflect an early leaning toward functionalism in his essay \\"Ethos, Worldview and the Analysis of Sacred Symbols\\", writing that \\"the drive to make sense out of experience, to give it form and order, is evidently as real and pressing as the more familiar biological needs.\\" Legacy Geertz's research and ideas have had a strong influence on 20th- century academia, including modern anthropology and communication studies, as well as for geographers, ecologists, political scientists, scholars of religion, historians, and other humanists. University of Miami Professor Daniel Pals (1996) wrote of Geertz that \\"his critics are few; his admirers legion.\\" Talal Asad attacked the dualism in Geertzian theory: the theory does not provide a bridge between external symbols and internal dispositions. Asad also pointed out the need for a more nuanced approach toward the historical background of certain concepts.Asad, Talal (1983). Anthropological Concepts of Religion: Reflections on Geertz. Man (N.S.) 18:237-59. Criticizing Geertz's theory of religion in general, Asad pointed out a gap between 'cultural system' and 'social reality' when attempting to define the concept of religion in universal terms. He would also criticize Geertz for ascribing an authorizing discourse around conversations of comparative religion that, Asad argues, doesn‚Äôt really exist. Furthermore, Asad criticized Geertz for operating according to a eurocentric view of religion that places import on signs and symbols that may or may not carry through in other non Judeo- Christian religious cultures.

The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than (or along with) restoration of normal function. Mechanisms Reperfusion of ischemic tissues is often associated with microvascular injury, particularly due to increased permeability of capillaries and arterioles that lead to an increase of diffusion and fluid filtration across the tissues. Activated endothelial cells produce more reactive oxygen species but less nitric oxide following reperfusion, and the imbalance results in a subsequent inflammatory response. The inflammatory response is partially responsible for the damage of reperfusion injury. White blood cells, carried to the area by the newly returning blood, release a host of inflammatory factors such as interleukins as well as free radicals in response to tissue damage. The restored blood flow reintroduces oxygen within cells that damages cellular proteins, DNA, and the plasma membrane. Damage to the cell's membrane may in turn cause the release of more free radicals. Such reactive species may also act indirectly in redox signaling to turn on apoptosis. White blood cells may also bind to the endothelium of small capillaries, obstructing them and leading to more ischemia. Another hypothesis would be that normally, tissues contain free radical scavengers to avoid damage by oxidizing species normally contained in the blood. Ischemic tissue would have decreased function of these scavengers because of cell injury. Once blood flow is reestablished, oxygen species contained in the blood will damage the ischemic tissue because the function of the scavengers is decreased. Reperfusion injury plays a major part in the biochemistry of hypoxic brain injury in stroke. Similar failure processes are involved in brain failure following reversal of cardiac arrest; control of these processes is the subject of ongoing research. Repeated bouts of ischemia and reperfusion injury also are thought to be a factor leading to the formation and failure to heal of chronic wounds such as pressure sores and diabetic foot ulcer. Continuous pressure limits blood supply and causes ischemia, and the inflammation occurs during reperfusion. As this process is repeated, it eventually damages tissue enough to cause a wound. In prolonged ischemia (60 minutes or more), hypoxanthine is formed as a breakdown product of ATP metabolism. The enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase acts in reverse, that is as a xanthine oxidase as a result of the higher availability of oxygen. This oxidation results in molecular oxygen being converted into highly reactive superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Xanthine oxidase also produces uric acid, which may act as both a prooxidant and as a scavenger of reactive species such as peroxynitrite. Excessive nitric oxide produced during reperfusion reacts with superoxide to produce the potent reactive species peroxynitrite. Such radicals and reactive oxygen species attack cell membrane lipids, proteins, and glycosaminoglycans, causing further damage. They may also initiate specific biological processes by redox signaling. Reperfusion can cause hyperkalemia. Reperfusion injury is a primary concern in liver transplantation surgery. Treatment Langendorff technique. Curve A - contractile function of the heart is greatly depressed after ischemia-reperfusion. Curve B - a set of short ischemic episodes (ischemic preconditioning) before prolonged ischemia provides functional recovery of contractile activity of the heart at reperfusion. A study of aortic cross-clamping, a common procedure in cardiac surgery, demonstrated a strong potential benefit with further research ongoing. Therapeutic hypothermia An intriguing area of research demonstrates the ability of a reduction in body temperature to limit ischemic injuries. This procedure is called therapeutic hypothermia, and it has been shown by a number of large, high-quality randomised trials to significantly improve survival and reduce brain damage after birth asphyxia in newborn infants, almost doubling the chance of normal survival. For a full review see Hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy. However, the therapeutic effect of hypothermia does not confine itself to metabolism and membrane stability. Another school of thought focuses on hypothermia's ability to prevent the injuries that occur after circulation returns to the brain, or what is termed reperfusion injuries. In fact an individual suffering from an ischemic insult continues suffering injuries well after circulation is restored. In rats it has been shown that neurons often die a full 24 hours after blood flow returns. Some theorize that this delayed reaction derives from the various inflammatory immune responses that occur during reperfusion.Adler, Jerry. \\"Back From the Dead.\\" Newsweek. July 23, 2007. These inflammatory responses cause intracranial pressure, pressure which leads to cell injury and in some situations cell death. Hypothermia has been shown to help moderate intracranial pressure and therefore to minimize the harmful effect of a patient's inflammatory immune responses during reperfusion. Beyond this, reperfusion also increases free radical production. Hypothermia too has been shown to minimize a patient's production of deadly free radicals during reperfusion. Many now suspect it is because hypothermia reduces both intracranial pressure and free radical production that hypothermia improves patient outcome following a blockage of blood flow to the brain. Hydrogen sulfide treatment There are some preliminary studies in mice that seem to indicate that treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can have a protective effect against reperfusion injury.Elrod J.W., J.W. Calvert, M.R. Duranski, D.J. Lefer. \\"Hydrogen sulfide donor protects against acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\\" Circulation 114(18):II172, 2006. Cyclosporin In addition to its well-known immunosuppressive capabilities, the one-time administration of cyclosporin at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been found to deliver a 40 percent reduction in infarct size in a small group proof of concept study of human patients with reperfusion injury published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2008. Cyclosporin has been confirmed in studies to inhibit the actions of cyclophilin D, a protein which is induced by excessive intracellular calcium flow to interact with other pore components and help open the MPT pore. Inhibiting cyclophilin D has been shown to prevent the opening of the MPT pore and protect the mitochondria and cellular energy production from excessive calcium inflows. However, the studies CIRCUS and CYCLE (published in September 2015 and February 2016 respectively) looked at the use of cyclosporin as a one time IV dose given right before perfusion therapy (PCI). Both studies found there is no statistical difference in outcome with cyclosporin administration. Research is ongoing. Reperfusion leads to biochemical imbalances within the cell that lead to cell death and increased infarct size. More specifically, calcium overload and excessive production of reactive oxygen species in the first few minutes after reperfusion set off a cascade of biochemical changes that result in the opening of the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT pore) in the mitochondrial membrane of cardiac cells. The opening of the MPT pore leads to the inrush of water into the mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and collapse. Upon collapse, the calcium is then released to overwhelm the next mitochondria in a cascading series of events that cause mitochondrial energy production supporting the cell to be reduced or stopped completely. The cessation of energy production results in cellular death. Protecting mitochondria is a viable cardioprotective strategy. In 2008, an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine called for more studies to determine if cyclosporin can become a treatment to ameliorate reperfusion injury by protecting mitochondria. To that end, in 2011 the researchers involved in the original 2008 NEJM study initiated a phase III clinical study of reperfusion injury in 1000 myocardial infarction patients in centers throughout Europe. Results of that study were announced in 2015 and indicated that \\"intravenous ciclosporin did not result in better clinical outcomes than those with placebo and did not prevent adverse left ventricular remodeling at 1 year\\". This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse. Ciclosporin is currently in a phase II/III (adaptive) clinical study in Europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage in traumatic brain injury. TRO40303 TRO40303 is a new cardioprotective compound that was shown to inhibit the MPT pore and reduce infarct size after ischemia- reperfusion. It was developed by Trophos company and currently is in Phase I clinical trial. Stem cell therapy Recent investigations suggest a possible beneficial effect of mesenchymal stem cells on heart and kidney reperfusion injury.  Superoxide dismutase  Superoxide dismutase is an effective anti-oxidant enzyme which converts superoxide anions to water and hydrogen peroxide. Recent researches have shown significant therapeutic effects on pre-clinical models of reperfusion injury after ischemic stroke.  Metformin  A series of 2009 studies published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology suggest that Metformin may prevent cardiac reperfusion injury by inhibition of Mitochondrial Complex I and the opening of MPT pore and in rats.  Cannabinoids  A study published in 2012 show that the synthetic analogue of the phytocannabinoid Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), Œî8-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (Œî8-THCV) and its metabolite 11-OH-Œî8-THCV, prevent hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through cannabinoid CB2 receptors and thereby decrease tissue injury and inflammation with a protective effect against liver damage. Pretreatment with a CB2 receptor antagonist attenuated the protective effects of Œî8-THCV, while a CB1 antagonist tended to enhance it. An earlier study published in 2011 found, that Cannabidiol (CBD) also protects against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by attenuating inflammatory signaling and response of oxidative and nitrative stress, and thereby cell death and tissue injury, but independent from classical CB1 and CB2 receptors. Reperfusion protection in obligate hibernators Obligatory hibernators such as the ground squirrels show resistance to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in liver, heart, and small intestine during the hibernation season when there is a switch from carbohydrate metabolism to lipid metabolism for cellular energy supply. This metabolic switch limits anaerobic metabolism and the formation of lactate, a herald of poor prognosis and multi-organ failure (MOF) after I/R injury. In addition, the increase in lipid metabolism generates ketone bodies and activates peroxisome proliferating-activated receptors (PPARs), both of which have been shown to be protective against I/R injury.

The plants are herbaceous monocots, spreading by rhizomes, and have large flowers set on terminal spikes, with stamens towering above the flowers. The type species X. moorei is found in the mountains of New Caledonia. The Poor Knights lily (X. callistemon) is endemic to the Poor Knights Islands and Taranga Island in the north of New Zealand. It was discovered in 1924. The Poor Knights lily has large bottlebrush flower clusters that grow horizontally. The clusters begin growing vertically and then bend sideways. Bright red flowers grow upward from the stalk, with bright orange pollen. The plant can reach a height of one metre tall and across. The APG IV system, of 2016, accepts this genus as constituting its own family Xeronemataceae. It places this in the order Asparagales, in the clade monocots.. The family can be separated from other Asparagales families on DNA evidence; it is related to Asphodelaceae but differs in having uniformly unifacial leaves like Iridaceae.

Form and purposes Court tombs are rectangular burial chambers. They are distinguished by their roofless, oval forecourt at the entrance. Large slabs of rock were used to make the walls and roof of the very basic burial chamber, normally located at one end of the cairn, which although usually blocked after use could be immediately accessed from the outside courtyard. They are gallery graves rather than passage graves, since they lack any significant passage. They usually had two functions: the chamber to serve as a tomb, and the courtyard to accommodate a ritual. Objects were often buried with the deceased, as the first neolithic people of this time believed in life after death.

Ships of the Italian Regia Marina were opposed by vessels of the British Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy. The battle occurred 30 miles to the east of Punta Stilo, Calabria, on 9 July 1940. It was one of the few pitched battles of the Mediterranean campaign during the Second World War involving large numbers of ships on both sides. Both sides claimed victory, but in fact the battle was a draw and everyone returned to their bases safely. Background When Italy entered the Second World War, its forces in Libya were ill-equipped for offensive operations, and the Italian fleet was forced to start large supply convoys in order to bring them up to fighting condition.Greene & Massignani, p. 65 On 6 July a convoy of four merchant ships left Naples on their way to Benghazi, while attempting to fool the Allies into thinking they were making for Tripoli. That evening two torpedo-boats from Catania and another freighter met them off Messina and the next day their escort force joined the convoy from Taranto after being informed that the Allies had recently left port in Alexandria. The transports carried 2,190 troops, 72 M11 tanks, 232 vehicles, 10,445 tons of supplies and 5,720 tons of fuel. The convoy's escort, commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni, consisted of three groups. The first, comprising eight destroyers and four torpedo boats, sailed directly protecting the cargo ships. A second group sailed to the east consisting of six heavy cruisers and another four destroyers. Finally, the main battle group consisted of two battleships ( and ), eight light cruisers and another 16 destroyers.Greene & Massignani, p. 67 A substantial number of the Italian destroyers didn't take part in the battle due to mechanical problems and the need to refuel. Meanwhile, the Allies were involved in a similar convoy action. The fleet sailed from Alexandria bound towards Malta where the destroyers would deliver supplies and a limited number of specialist reinforcements. Two convoys were arranged to take off fleet stores and civilians from Malta to Alexandria. Two groups of merchantmen sailed, a fast convoy at and slow one at . Protecting them were three groups of ships: Force A, with five cruisers and a destroyer; Force B, with the battleship and five destroyers, and Force C, the main battle group, with the battleships and , the aircraft carrier and eleven destroyers.Greene & Massignani, p. 66 One of them, , had to return to Alexandria with a burst steam pipe on the early hours of 8 July.HMS Imperial ( D 0 9 ) All were under the direction of Admiral Andrew Cunningham. At 14:40 on 8 July two Italian Cant Z.506 seaplanes from Tobruk spotted the British fleet and shadowed it for nearly four hours. Admiral Campioni ordered his fleet to defend the convoy by turning eastward and preparing for action. The Italian Supreme Command, however, was reluctant to risk its warships in a night-time encounter, and they ordered the fleet to avoid contact.Greene & Massignani, p. 68 During the initial positioning the Italians suffered technical problems on three destroyers and two light cruisers, so these ships, with several additional destroyers, were detached to refuel in Sicily. In order to make up for these \\"losses\\", another destroyer group was summoned from Taranto. At this point, the Italian fleet had 16 destroyers.Greene & Massignani, p. 70 Meanwhile, the Allies were having problems as well. From 10:00 to 18.40, 72 land-based bombers of the Italian (Royal Air Force) from the mainland attacked their fleet. Unlike the dive- bombers favored by the Germans, Italian bombers operated in formations at high altitudes during the early stages of the war, about 12,000 feet. While scores of bombs were dropped by the Italians, a single hit on represented the outcome of two major attacks.Miller, War at Sea, pg. 113 This was a serious hit on the bridge, killing the captain, six officers and eleven ratings. In addition, three officers and six ratings were wounded. The forward fire control and the steering equipment was destroyed, and for the rest of the battle, she would be commanded from the emergency station.HMS Gloucester ‚Äì Town-type Light Cruiser At 15:10 on 8 July, Cunningham's fleet steamed toward Taranto, in order to cut the Italians' return route. At dusk, Cunningham changed course from 310¬∞ to 260¬∞ and slowed the fleet speed. During the first hours of 9 July, they took a 305¬∞ course, to avoid the Italian air reconnaissance while keeping their fleet between the Italian squadron and the Gulf of Taranto.Greene & Massignani, pp. 68‚Äì69 By 12:30, the Italian Supreme Command was unaware of the situation of the British fleet. Campioni told his fleet to scramble by 14:00 about south east of Cape Spartivento in search of the enemy. Campioni eventually received reports of the British position at 13:30, and six Ro.43 floatplanes launched shortly after by the Italian cruisers spotted the British warships 30 miles closer than supposed. By late evening of 8 July, the Italian convoy had arrived in Bengazi unscathed. Battle Cruiser engagement At noon on 9 July the two fleets were apart. Vice Admiral Cunningham could not close the distance to engage with the significantly slower Royal Sovereign and Malaya ( vs ) and took Warspite in on its own. Meanwhile, at 13:15, Eagle launched several unsuccessful sorties by Fairey Swordfish against the Italian heavy cruisers, which they took for battleships. At 13:10, the Italian Supreme Command had instructed Campioni to engage one of the two enemy forces facing him, but in fact they had planned to keep the action close to Italy and were deliberately moving north in order to draw the Allies closer to their airbases. By 14:00, however, Cunningham's plans to cut off the Italian fleet from Taranto had succeeded.Greene & Massignani, p. 72 The Allied cruiser group was spread out in front of Warspite and at 15:15 they caught sight of the Italian main battle force and the two groups opened fire at . Italian rangefinding was better than the Allied, and within three minutes they had found the distance even though they were firing at extreme range. Although the Allies' rangefinding was not as good and they had trouble with their rounds falling short, the Allied gunlaying was better and they were able to place their rounds in much tighter groups. Generally the gunnery of the two forces was fairly well matched. After only a few minutes the range was down to and the Allied guns became useful. However, by 15:22, the Italian fire came dangerously close to the Allied cruisers and Vice Admiral John Tovey decided to disengage.Action off Calabria ‚Äì Initial skirmish At this point splinters from a shell fired by the cruiser Action of Calabria by Christian D'AdamoJordan, John (2008).

Battleship engagement One group of Italian light cruisers, mistaken for the heavy cruisers of the , was on the Allied side of the battle line and was soon within range of the charging Warspite. Once again the Allied rounds fell short, and neither of her targets, and , received any damage in the initial salvos. However, by this time Warspite was also out of position, and she circled in place in order to allow Malaya to catch up. Meanwhile, Royal Sovereign was still well to the rear. The Italian commander decided to take on Warspite, and started moving his two battleships into position. At 15:52 Giulio Cesare opened fire at a range of . Conte di Cavour held her fire, as Italian strategy was to have only one ship targeted at a time. It had been discovered during the Battle of Jutland that more than one ship firing at a single target made it very difficult for the rangefinding parties to tell which rounds were fired by their ship. Conte di Cavour had been assigned to Malaya and Royal Sovereign, which did not enter the engagement.O'Hara, p. 40. Warspite, not aware of the Italian firing patterns, split her guns between the two ships. During the exchange one of Giulio Cesares rounds fell long and caused splinter damage to Warspites escorting destroyers and , which had formed up on the far side of the action.Jordan (2008), p. 34 At 15:54 Malaya started firing, well out of range, hoping to cause some confusion on the Italian ships. Meanwhile, the Italian heavy cruisers came into action and started firing on Warspite at 15:55 but had to break off as the Allied cruisers returned. At 15:59 two shells from Giulio Cesare fell very close to Warspite. Almost immediately after one of Warspites rounds hit the rear deck of Giulio Cesare, exploding in the funnel, and setting off the stored ammunition for one of her anti-aircraft guns. Two seamen were killed and several wounded.Marina Militare italiana, part 1 1940‚Äì45, p 39, Albertelli Edizioni, Parma, 2015 The fumes from the burning ammunition were sucked down into the engine room, which had to evacuate and shut down half of the boilers. Giulio Cesares speed quickly fell off to 18 knots and Conte di Cavour took over. Giulio Cesare and Warspite were well over apart at the time of the hit, which was one of the longest-range naval artillery hits in history. It would appear that Warspite was in an excellent position to deal some serious blows to the slowing Giulio Cesare, but she once again executed another tight turn to allow Malaya to catch up. With her guns suddenly silenced during the turn, rangefinders on Malaya discovered what the Italians had been intending to avoid, that her rounds were falling short of Giulio Cesare and they had been watching Warspites rounds, not their own. At 16:01 the Italian destroyers generated smoke and the battleships got under cover. There is some debate about this point today, the Allied position being that the battleships were leaving battle, the Italian that they were attempting to make a torpedo attack with their destroyers from within the smoke. Final actions At 15:58 re-opened fire on her counterpart in the Allied line, , and soon two groups of Italian cruisers (, and , closely followed by and ) entered combat range with the main Allied cruiser battle group. Firing continued as both groups attempted to form up and at 16:07 Bolzano was hit three times by 6 in shells from HMS Neptune, temporarily locking her rudder and causing two fatalities in the torpedo room. A near miss on the destroyer caused minor damage.Action off Calabria ‚Äì Cruisers and destroyers Meanwhile, mechanics on Giulio Cesare were able to repair two of the four damaged boilers, allowing the battleship to reach .Capital Ship Surface Actions World War 2, by Terry A. Gardner, EMC(SW) USNR ret Admiral Campioni, considering the possibility of his remaining battleship, Conte di Cavour, having to face three enemy battleships and an aircraft carrier, decided to withdraw the battleships towards Messina.Greene & Massignani, p. 75 Giulio Cesare was out of action for 30 days. Over the next hour both fleets attempted to make long-range torpedo runs with their destroyer groups, without success.Greene & Massignani, pp. 74‚Äì75 At 16:40, the Italian air force made an attack with 126 aircraft, reporting damage on Eagle, Warspite and Malaya; because of some misunderstanding, 50 of the Italian aircraft also attacked the Italian ships, without damage. The battle ended at 16:50 with both sides withdrawing.Greene & Massignani, p. 77 One final victim was the destroyer , sent to Augusta in Sicily, which was hit by a torpedo launched from a Swordfish at 09:40 the next day and sank in shallow water. She was refloated and returned to service in December 1941.) Aftermath After the battle both fleets turned for home. This allowed the Italians to claim a victory of sorts, as their cargo ships were already past the action by this time and sailed safely for Libya.Sadkovich, James (1990).Reevaluating major naval combatants of World War II. Greenwood Press, p. 137. Meanwhile, the Allied ships also reached Alexandria along with their escort. Although the battle was indecisive, Allied sources claimed that the Royal Navy asserted an important \\"moral ascendancy\\" over their Italian counterpart.Hill, J. R. and Ranft, Bryan (2002). The Oxford illustrated history of the Royal Navy. Oxford University Press, p. 358. Other sources instead dispute those claims, pointing out that, in the immediate aftermath of the battle, the moods of the two commanders were quite different. Campioni wrote that, even having been able to employ only two old refurbished battleships, the battle gave to every man in the fleet, from the senior officers to the seamen, the impression of being able to cope with the British Fleet on equal terms. Cunningham, conversely, was dismayed by the performance of his two older units, whose lack of speed permitted the Italians to dictate the course of the action, and whose cannon were out-ranged not only by those of the two Italian battleships, but by those of the heavy cruisers as well. Cunningham dismissed the Royal Sovereign as a \\"constant source of anxiety\\", and asked the Admiralty for two or three more s, possibly equipped with radar, a new carrier with an armoured deck, the heavy cruisers and , and enough smaller ships to cover the major units.Bernard Ireland, The War in the Mediterranean 1940‚Äì1943 (1993), p. 37.

A gallery grave is a form of megalithic tomb built primarily during the Neolithic Age in Europe in which the main gallery of the tomb is entered without first passing through an antechamber or hallway. There are at least four major types of gallery grave (complex, transepted, segmented, and wedge-shaped), and they may be covered with an earthen mound (or \\"tumulus\\") or rock mound (or \\"cairn\\"). About gallery graves Archeologist T. Douglas Price argues that the gallery grave was a form of community burial site. Those placed in a gallery grave were most likely members of the same family or hamlet, and probably were intended to reinforce the sense of community. Gallery graves may be straight, or they may form an ell. In some cases, a burial chamber exists at the end of the gallery. The walls of gallery graves were built of orthostats, slab-like stones set upright in the earth. They were roofed with multiple flat stones, although the burial chamber (if one existed) was usually roofed with a single large stone. Multiple burials could occur all at one time, the grave could be reopened several times to accept new burials, or the grave could remain open over an extended period of time to accept multiple burials. La Roche-aux-F√©es, a gallery grave in France Drawing of the plan of the segmented gallery grave at La Roche-aux-F√©es in France. Capstones (forming the ceiling) are represented by dotted lines. Burials in gallery graves were made in the gallery itself, or in small burial chambers opening off the gallery. This is known as a \\"complex gallery grave\\". When the adjacent burial chambers are paired, the structure is known as a \\"transepted gallery grave\\". Gallery graves may also have their galleries subdivided by interior stone slabs. These are known as \\"segmented gallery graves\\". When two parallel galleries lead to a single terminal burial chamber, this is known as a \\"parallel gallery grave\\". Some gallery graves were not rectangular in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear. These are known as wedge-shaped gallery graves. The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the rear, and a sill of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance or one or two slabs set upright in the earth defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a cairn (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or \\"tumulus\\"), although an earthen mound was sometimes used. The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a kerb (ring of stone) was used to help revet the cairn and keep it in place. Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear. A few had the terminal burial chamber at the rear of the gallery, although this was usually blocked off. Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls. These could be parallel to the inner walls, or they could be set at an even stronger angle (emphasizing the wedge-like nature of the tomb). Wedge-shaped gallery graves usually faced west, and often had a pair of upright stone slabs linking the inner and outer walls at the entrance. The tumulus (or \\"barrow\\") covering a gallery grave may be ovate or long. The sides of the tumulus may be parallel or not. The tumulus was designed so that the end of the gallery (or the terminal burial chamber, if one existed) was at the center of the tumulus. A tumulus may contain several gallery graves radiating outward from the center. Since the earth atop the gallery grave was only loosely piled up, it often washed away due to erosion. Many gallery graves today lie exposed to the air, when originally they would have lain deep within a tumulus. Transepted Transepted gallery graves have burial monuments with side rooms extending laterally from a central chamber. They are found at sites in the Loire valley of France, south west Great Britain and in Ireland and it is thought the builders had cultural links with one another. Wedge-shaped Altar Wedge Tomb, County Cork Glantane East Wedge Tomb, County Cork, Ireland A wedge- shaped gallery grave or wedge tomb is a type of Irish chamber tomb. They are so named because the burial chamber narrows at one end (usually decreasing both in height and width from west to east), producing a wedge shape in elevation. An antechamber is separated from the burial area by a simple jamb or sill, and the doorway generally faces west. A distinguishing characteristic of wedge tombs is the double-walling of the gallery. They were often covered by cairns, which could be round, oval or D-shaped, often with a kerb to revet it. More are low sized, usually about 1.5 metres high, and are generally found on mountainsides, about three-quarters the way up. Wedge tombs were built between the Irish late Neolithic and middle Bronze Ages (about 2500 to 2000BC). Today, between 500 and 550 known wedge tombs survive in Ireland, and are found predominantly in the west and north west of the island. Dating Along with the dolmen and passage grave, the gallery grave is the most common megalithic tomb in western Europe. Gallery graves were usually constructed during the Neolithic Age, which began about 10,200 BC and ended in Europe about 3,200 BC. Some, however, were constructed in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, about 2,300 BC to 600 BC. Dating of some gallery graves is difficult, as the tombs may have been constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, but reopened and used for burials until the Late Bronze Age. Gallery vs. passage grave The difference between a complex gallery grave and a passage grave (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold. First, the gallery grave gallery will be as high and wide as the side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not as high or wide as the burial chambers. Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.

The design of this boat was the result of a competition held by the Scandinavian Yacht Racing Union in 1942, who were hoping to create an easily sailed and low-cost boat. The competition produced no outright \\"winner \\" but, taking the best features of a number of the entries received, the organisers commissioned professional designer Tord Sund√©n to create a craft that met the goals of the design competition. The resulting boat went on to become an international favorite of sailors and still endures more than 70 years after its design. The first Nordic Folkboat was built in Gothenburg in Sweden, and as of 2007, more than 4000 Nordic Folkboats are still sailing around the world. Design Wooden Nordic Folkboat in 2007 The Nordic Folkboat was designed to be constructed of wood with a clinker or lap-strake hull. Oak framing and fir planking were specified, though different builders used many different species of wood. The boat has an open cockpit and a low coachroof covering a small trunk cabin usually consisting of two bunks and minimal lockerage. The boat is rigged as a simple fractional sloop, with minimal standing rigging, consisting only of two lower shrouds, two jumper shrouds, a headstay, and a backstay. Despite the simplicity of the rigging, the mast is highly tunable, enabling the Folkboat to sail well in light and heavy air well beyond initial expectations. The boat‚Äôs iron ballast keel represents more than half of this displacement, it extremely stiff and seaworthy. It is one of the smallest craft to have made regular ocean crossings and circumnavigations. Evolution A fibreglass and timber Folkboat lay side by side. The cabin top and cockpit on the right differ from the original design. In 1966 Tord Sund√©n introduced the carvel- planked ‚ÄúInternational Folkboat‚Äù with a self-bailing cockpit. This design corresponded largely to the original, but offered more comfort below deck and safety above. However, the term ‚ÄúInternational Folkboat‚Äù was too misleading and was forbidden. Today, the class is simply called ‚ÄúIF-boat.‚Äù The IF-boat was manufactured at Marieholms Bruk in Sm√•land (Sweden) until 1984. In 1968 the Folkboat began to be manufactured in modern molded glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) ‚Äúfiberglass‚Äù. In 1975, Erik Andreasen, a Dane, introduced a GRP replica of the original design, since known as the ‚Äú Nordic Folkboat‚Äù, using a mold taken from his own Gold Cup winning boat. Weights and measurements were carefully preserved to ensure level competition with wooden boats, and only an outboard engine was provided. Today wooden and GRP boats race together. The class rules are administrated by the Folkboat International Association. The largest international regattas are: Gold Cup (an unofficial world championship), Sessan Cup (a team race), Kieler Woche and San Francisco Cup. There are active fleets in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium and Estonia. Long distance sailing In the 1950s, the Folkboat began to attract the attention of long- distance voyagers for its modest cost and seaworthiness. * Ann Gash from Australia made a single-handed circumnavigation in Ilimo between 1975 and 1977. * 1962/1963 Adrian Hayter sailed single handed from the U.K. to New Zealand in 'Valkyr' by the Westward/Panama route. * Lt. Col. H.G. \\"Blondie\\" Hasler sailed a greatly modified folkboat Jester to second place in the first Observer Singlehanded Trans Atlantic Race in 1960. * Mike Richie sailed Jester in several Singlehanded Trans Atlantic Races until it was damaged and lost at sea. Richie survived and competed for many years in a replica. * Rozelle Raines sailed Martha McGilda singlehanded to Russia in the 1960s, the first British Woman to do so. * Sharon Sites Adams was the first woman to single- hand from California to Hawaii, in 1965. Fleets Folkboats in San Francisco According to Nordic Folkboat International Association by 2007, the largest Folkboat fleet is in Sweden (1300 registered boats) followed by Denmark (1125), Germany (900), Finland (400), UK (100), U.S.A. (100) and The Netherlands (48). * In the United Kingdom, a large fleet has developed on the south coast, and the class is continuing to expand. The 2018 Nordic Folkboat Nationals were hosted by the Royal Lymington Yacht Club. * In the United States, an active group of Folkboats in the San Francisco Bay Area is organized as the San Francisco Bay Folkboat Association, which schedules various racing and social events such as the bi-annual San Francisco Cup Regatta. The San Francisco Bay fleet has been supported over the years by the Alameda, California boatbuilder Sven Svendsen, who was the first US builder of Fiberglass Nordic Folkboats. * In Canada, a racing fleet existed on Lake Ontario from the early 1950s till the 1970s. Approximately 24 Danish built Folkboats were imported, the earlier ones being the first Folkboats in North America. There were three builders of Folkboats in operation at various times, one is still in operation but has not built a boat of that class for some time. Many of the original Danish built Folkboats and most of the more numerous Canadian built boats are still sailing, particularly on the Great Lakes where they are a common sight in most harbours. * In Estonia, a recent revival of Folkboat class has occurred. During the Soviet occupation, many Folkboats were built at Tallinn Experimental Shipyard of Sport Vessels. Due to varying quality, most of these boats have not survived. Nevertheless, a group of enthusiasts has restored few old folkboats (or \\"folkars\\", as they are called in Estonian sailing slang) and brought in additional boats mostly from Sweden. In 2012, as many as 11 Nordic Folkboats have been registered for annual Offshore Championship of Estonia. Currently, 25 Folkboats are registered in the database of Estonian Yachting Union. The Folkboat is also a popular cruising yacht especially in the Baltic Sea area, despite its small interior size and lack of \\"heads\\". Design considerations  At the time of the Folkboat‚Äôs design many Scandinavian sailors lacked the money to purchase and maintain a large yacht, or even pay for the design of a custom small yacht. Many members needed to store their boats on land. Many also wanted to build their own boats. Combining resources to get an excellent design was economical. The folkboat was therefore designed for regional Scandinavian conditions. Sailing in the Baltic is mostly pleasant island-hopping. Most trips are in shallow water, on the continental shelf, in rivers and canals, often with low bridges, but there are ventures into deep ocean. The Baltic is also windy, with dangerous equinoctial storms. These original considerations remain true for Folkboat owners today. Rig The Folkboat is a fractionally rigged sloop, with the forestay attached 7/8s the way to the masthead. This Puts less pressure on the mast, and makes the boat less top-heavy than a masthead rigged sloop. It also makes the boat easier to sail into the wind. The standard suit of sails a mainsail and jib, both with reefing ties. The Association also defines a spinnaker, and Finland's folkboat association permits one for racing. The design includes an optional hinged mast tabernacle (a hinge for the mast to fold), allowing the boat to sail under low bridges, as commonly found on canals. The trade-off of a 7/8ths rig is that it reduces the area of the jib substantially. In the Baltic, and the stormy areas where the folkboat is most popular, the problem is often one of too much wind, Making this an advantage where the boat is sailed most frequently. In the tropics, where most of the time the wind is lighter, a folkboat is often under-powered with the standard rig. Some owners choose to rerig for a larger jib. A tropical conversion favored by several cruisers is to add a short removable (\\"studding\\") bowsprit and light removable top-stay. This lets a folkboat fly a very light full genoa jib (a drifter) outboard of the cut of its standard jib. In heavy weather, the bowsprit and light stay have little windage and weight, and can be left up. In higher latitudes or racing, both can be dismounted, allowing a return of the boat to its classic traits. A more radical innovation was placed on the famous series of three single-handed transatlantic racing Jesters, which were rigged with a single flat elliptical sail. This Chinese junk-like sail is so simple that it could be completely managed from inside the boat. Weight and balance The folkboat's most extreme feature is a 1000 kg cast-iron keel, representing just more than half of the boat's weight (compared to a typical sailboat‚Äòs keel of 1/3 or less). The heavy keel slows the boat more than a fin keel, by both forcing the hull deeper in the water and causing more area to be wetted. However, it lets a Folkboat sail in only 1.2 meters of water, yet remain safe in very strong winds. The iron keel is also very sturdy, resisting damage common for week-end sailors in shallow water, such as running aground. Hull form The Folkboat hull is a classic shallow-water sailing form, with a semi-elliptical low-drag full-length keel and an integrated rudder whose bottom is physically protected by the keel. The long elliptical keel resists side-ways forces, minimizing leeway. To keep the boat simple, reliable, inexpensive and strong, it has no centerboard and only a simple rudder. History of innovation The hullform is designed for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker- built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved carvel-built boats (ends of the hull planking butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun- shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, whisker and spinnaker poles.

As a result of this conflict, Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (province), of which the main sub-provinces (sanjaks) were Fezzan, Cyrenaica, and Tripoli itself. These territories became the colonies of Italian Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, which would later merge into Italian Libya. During the conflict, Italian forces also occupied the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea. Italy agreed to return the Dodecanese to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Ouchy in 1912. However, the vagueness of the text, combined with subsequent adverse events unfavourable to the Ottoman Empire (the outbreak of the Balkan Wars and World War I), allowed a provisional Italian administration of the islands, and Turkey eventually renounced all claims on these islands in Article 15 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Although minor, the war was a significant precursor of the First World War as it sparked nationalism in the Balkan states. Seeing how easily the Italians had defeated the weakened Ottomans, the members of the Balkan League attacked the Ottoman Empire starting the First Balkan War before the war with Italy had ended. The Italo-Turkish War saw numerous technological changes, notably the airplane. On October 23, 1911, an Italian pilot, Capitano Carlo Piazza, flew over Turkish lines on the world's first aerial reconnaissance mission, and on November 1, the first ever aerial bomb was dropped by Sottotenente Giulio Gavotti, on Turkish troops in Libya, from an early model of Etrich Taube aircraft.U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission: Aviation at the Start of the First World War The Turks, lacking anti-aircraft weapons, were the first to shoot down an aeroplane by rifle fire.James D. Crabtree: On air defense, , Greenwood Publishing Group, page 9 Another use of new technology was a network of wireless telegraphy stations established soon after the initial landings.Wireless telegraphy in the Italo-Turkish War Guglielmo Marconi himself came to Libya to conduct experiments with the Italian Corps of Engineers. Background The claims of Italy over Libya dated back to Turkey's defeat by Russia in the war of 1877‚Äì1878 and subsequent discussions after the Congress of Berlin in 1878, in which France and Great Britain had agreed to the occupation of Tunisia and Cyprus respectively, both parts of the declining Ottoman Empire. When Italian diplomats hinted about possible opposition by their government, the French replied that Tripoli would have been a counterpart for Italy. Italy made a secret agreement with Great Britain in February 1887 by an exchange of notes. It provided that Italy would support Great Britain and its role in Egypt while the Italians would receive British support in Libya. In 1902, Italy and France had signed a secret treaty which accorded freedom of intervention in Tripolitania and Morocco. The agreement negotiated by Italian foreign minister Giulio Prinetti and French ambassador Camille Barr√®re was an endpoint in the historical rivalry between the two nations for control of northern Africa. Also in 1902, Great Britain promised that \\"any alteration in the status of Libya would be in conformity with Italian interests.\\" These measures were intended to loosen Italian commitment to the Triple Alliance and thereby weaken Germany, which France and Britain viewed as their main rival on the continent. Following the Anglo- Russian Convention and the establishment of the Triple Entente, Tsar Nicholas II and King Victor Emmanuel III made the 1909 Racconigi Bargain in which Russia acknowledged Italy's interest in Tripoli and Cyrenaica in return for Italian support for Russian control of the Bosphorus. However, the Italian government did little to realize the opportunity, thus knowledge of Libyan territory and resources remained scarce in the following years.The removal of diplomatic obstacles coincided with increasing colonial fervor. In 1908, the Italian Colonial Office was upgraded to a Central Directorate of Colonial Affairs. Nationalist Enrico Corradini led the public call for action in Libya, and joined by the nationalist newspaper L'Idea Nazionale in 1911, demanded an invasion.Clark, pp. 244-245 The Italian press began a large-scale lobbying campaign in favour of an invasion of Libya at the end of March 1911. It was fancifully depicted as rich in minerals, well-watered, and defended by only 4,000 Ottoman troops. Also, the population was described as hostile to the Ottoman Empire and friendly to the Italians: the future invasion was going to be little more than a \\"military walk\\", according to them. Italy's government remained committed into 1911 to the maintenance of the Ottoman Empire, which was a close friend of their German ally. Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti rejected nationalist calls for conflict over Ottoman Albania, which was seen as a possible colonial project, as late as the summer of 1911. Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, 1905 However, the Agadir Crisis, in which French military action in Morocco in April 1911 would lead to the establishment of a French protectorate, changed the political calculations. At this point, the Italian leadership decided that it could safely accede to public demands for a colonial project. The Triple Entente powers were highly supportive. British foreign secretary Edward Grey stated to the Italian ambassador on 28 July that they would support Italy and would not support the Turks; on 19 September, Grey instructed Permanent Under-secretary of State Sir Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock that England and France should not interfere with Italy's designs on Libya. Meanwhile, the Russian government urged Italy to act in a \\"prompt and resolute manner.\\" Clark, pp. 245-246 In contrast to their engagement with the Entente powers, Italy largely ignored its military allies in the Triple Alliance. Giolitti and foreign minister Antonino Patern√≤ Castello agreed on 14 September to launch a military campaign \\"before the Austrian and German governments [were aware] of it.\\" At the time, Germany was actively attempting to mediate between Rome and Constantinople, while Austrian foreign minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal repeatedly warned Italy that military action in Libya would threaten the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and create a crisis in the Eastern Question, thereby destabilizing the Balkan peninsula and the continent's balance of power. Italy also foresaw this result: Patern√≤ Castello, in a July report to the king and Giolitti, laid out the pros and cons of a military action in Libya and raised the concern that the Balkan revolt that would likely follow an Italian attack against Libya might force Austria to take military action in Balkan areas claimed by Italy.Clark, pp. 246 The Socialist Party had strong influence over public opinion. However, it was in opposition and also divided on the issue. It acted ineffectively against a military intervention. The future fascist leader Benito Mussolini ‚Äì at this time still a left-wing Socialist ‚Äì took a prominent anti-war position. A similar opposition was expressed in Parliament by Gaetano Salvemini and Leone Caetani. An ultimatum was presented to the Ottoman government led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) party on the night of 26‚Äì27 September 1911. Through Austrian intermediation, the Ottomans replied with the proposal of transferring control of Libya without war, maintaining a formal Ottoman suzerainty. This suggestion was comparable to the situation in Egypt, which was under formal Ottoman suzerainty but was actually controlled by the United Kingdom. Giolitti refused, and war was declared on September 29, 1911. Military campaign Opening maneuver Italian dirigibles bomb Turkish positions on Libyan territory. The Italo-Turkish War was the first in history to feature aerial bombardment by airplanes and airships.Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare, pg.19 Ismail Enver Bey in Cyrenaica, 1911. Despite the time it had had to prepare the invasion, the Royal Italian Army (Regio Esercito) was largely unprepared when the war broke out. The Italian fleet appeared off Tripoli in the evening of September 28, but only began bombarding the port on October 3. The city was conquered by 1,500 sailors, much to the enthusiasm of the interventionist minority in Italy. Another proposal for a diplomatic settlement was rejected by the Italians, and the Turks determined, therefore, to defend the province.30 September Italy and Trablusgarp (tr) The Turks did not have a full army in Tripolitania. Many of the Ottoman officers had to travel there by their own means, often secretly, through Egypt, since the British would not allow Turkish troops to be transported en masse through Egypt. The Ottoman Navy was too weak to transport troops by sea. The Turks organized local Libyans for the defence against the Italian invasion.M. Taylan Sorgun, \\"Bitmeyen Savas\\", 1972. Memoirs of Halil Pasa Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu, the then capital of Italian Somaliland, served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the Somalian troops stationed would only return home in 1935, when they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia. Italian troops landing in Libya The first disembarkation of Italian troops occurred on October 10. The city of Tripoli and surroundings -after a destructive bombing of the Turkish fortifications- were quickly conquered by 1,500 Italian sailors, welcomed by the population (mainly the local Jews) who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities.Tripoli inhabitants welcomed the Italians, p. 36-40 (in Italian) The Italian contingent of 20,000 troops was deemed sufficient to accomplish the conquest at the time. Tobruk, Derna and Khoms were easily conquered, but the same was not true for Benghazi. The first true setback for the Italian troops happened on October 23 at Shar al-Shatt, when poor placement of the troops near Tripoli led them to be almost completely encircled by more mobile Arab cavalry, backed by some Turkish regular units. The attack was portrayed as a simple revolt by the Italian press, but it nearly annihilated much of the small Italian expeditionary corps. The corps was consequently enlarged to 100,000 men who had to face 20,000 Libyans and 8,000 Turks. The war turned into one of position. Even some of the earliest examples of utilisation in modern warfare of armoured carsCrow, Encyclopedia of Armored Cars, pg.104. and air power by the Italian forces had little effect on the initial outcome.Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare, pg.19. However, the war was notable for the first military use of heavier-than-air craft. Capitano Carlo Piazza flew the first military reconnaissance flight on 23 October 1911. A week later, Sottotenente Giulio Gavotti dropped four grenades on Tajura (Arabic: ÿ™ÿßÿ¨Ÿàÿ±ÿßÿ°‚Äé TƒÅj≈´rƒÅ‚Äô), also spelt Tajoura, and Ain Zara in history's first aerial bombing.Hallion Strike From the Sky: The History of Battlefield Air Attack, 1910‚Äì1945, p. 11.

The Libyans and Turks, estimated at 15,000, made frequent attacks by day and night on the strongly entrenched Italian garrison in the southern suburbs of Benghazi. The four Italian regiments of infantry acted on the defensive and were supported by the and . The Italians rarely attempted a sortie.William Henry Beehler, The History of the Italian-Turkish War, September 29, 1911, to October 18, 1912, Engagements At Benghasi And Derna In December 1911 (p.49) An attack of 20,000 Turkish and local troops was repulsed on November 30 with considerable losses. Shortly after this, the garrison was reinforced by the 57th infantry regiment from Italy. The battleship also arrived from Tobruk. During the night of December 14 and 15, the Turks attacked in great force, but were repulsed with aid of the fire from the ships. The Italians lost several field guns. At Derna the Turks and Libyans were estimated at 3,500, but they were being constantly reinforced and a general assault on the Italian position was expected. The Italian and Turkish forces in Tripoli and Cyrenaica were constantly reinforced. The withdrawal of the Turks into the interior enabled them to reinforce their troops considerably. The cost of the war was defrayed chiefly by voluntary offerings from Muslims. Turkish officers and men, weapons, ammunition, and all kinds of supplies were constantly sent across the Egyptian and Tunisian frontiers, notwithstanding their neutrality.

With this achievement, he was assigned to Derna War quarters to coordinate the field on March 6, 1912. The Libyan campaign ground to a stalemate by December 1911. On 3 March 1912, 1,500 Libyan volunteers attacked Italian troops who were building trenches near Derna. The Italians, who were outnumbered but had superior weaponry, held the line. A lack of coordination between the Italian units sent from Derna as reinforcements and the intervention of Turkish artillery threatened the Italian line, and the Libyans attempted to surround the Italian troops. Further Italian reinforcements, however, were able to stabilise the situation, and the battle ended in the afternoon with an Italian victory. On September 14, the Italian command sent three columns of infantry to disband the Arab Turkish camp near Derna. The Italian troops occupied a plateau, interrupting Turkish supply lines. Three days later, the Turkish commander, Enver Bey, attacked the Italian positions on the plateau. The larger Italian fire drove back the Turkish soldiers, who were surrounded by a battalion of Alpini and suffered heavy losses. A later Turkish attack had the same outcome. After that, operations in Cyrenaica ceased until the end of the war. Although some elements of the local population collaborated with the Italians, counterattacks by Turkish soldiers with the help of local troops confined the Italian army to the coastal region. In fact, by the end of 1912 the Italians had made little progress in conquering Libya. The Italian soldiers were, in effect, besieged in seven enclaves on the coasts of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. The largest of these, at Tripoli, extended barely 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the town.Libya: a modern history, John Wright, Taylor & Francis, 1981, , page 28. Naval warfare Italian cruiser bombarding Ottoman vessels in Beirut harbor. At sea, the Italians enjoyed a clear advantage. The Italian navy had seven times the tonnage of the Ottoman navy and was better trained.Tucker, Roberts, 2005, page 945. In January 1912, the Italian cruiser Piemonte, with the Soldato class destroyers Artigliere and Garibaldino, sank seven Turkish gunboats (Ayintab, Bafra, G√∂kcedag, Kastamonu, Muha, Ordu and Refahiye) and a yacht (Sipka) in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay. The Italians blockaded the Red Sea ports of the Ottomans, while actively supplying and supporting the Emirate of Asir which was also concurrently at war with the Ottoman Empire. Then, on 24 February, in the Battle of Beirut, two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters, retreated, then returned and sank an Ottoman torpedo boat. alone suffered 58 killed and 108 wounded. By contrast, the Italian ships not only took no casualties but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships at all. Italy had feared that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to threaten the approach to the Suez Canal. The Ottoman naval presence at Beirut was completely annihilated and casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. The Italian navy gained complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean for the rest of the war. Although Italy could extend its control to almost all of the 2,000 km of the Libyan coast between April and early August 1912, its ground forces could not venture beyond the protection of the navy's guns and were thus limited to a thin coastal strip. In the summer of 1912, Italy began operations against the Turkish possessions in the Aegean Sea with the approval of the other powers that were eager to end a war that was lasting much longer than expected. Italy occupied twelve islands in the sea, comprising the Ottoman province of Rhodes, which henceforth became known as the Dodecanese, but this raised the discontent of Austria-Hungary, which feared that this could fuel the irredentism of nations such as Serbia and Greece, causing imbalance in the already fragile situation in the Balkan area. The only other relevant military operation of the summer was an attack of five Italian torpedo boats in the Dardanelles on 18 July. Irregular war and atrocities Mustafa Kemal (left) with an Ottoman military officer and Libyan mujahideen. With a decree of November 5, 1911, Italy declared its sovereignty over Libya. Although it controlled the coast, many of the Ottoman troops were not killed in battle and nearly 6,000 remained to face an army of nearly 140,000 Italians. As a result, the Ottomans began using guerrilla tactics. Indeed, some \\"Young Turk\\" officers reached Libya and helped organize a guerrilla war with local mujahideens. Many local Libyans joined forces with the Turks because of their common faith against the \\"Christian invaders\\" and started a bloody guerrilla warfare: Italian authorities adopted many repressive measures against the rebels, such as public hanging as a retaliation for ambushes. On October 23, 1911, nearly 500 Italian soldiers were slaughtered by Turkish troops at Sciara Sciatt, on the outskirts of Tripoli. As a consequence, on the next day‚Äîduring the 1911 Tripoli massacre‚ÄîItalian troops systematically murdered thousands of civilians by moving through local homes and gardens one by one, including setting fire to a mosque with one hundred refugees inside. Although Italian authorities attempted to keep the news of the massacre from getting out, the incident soon became internationally known. The Italians started to show photos of the massacred Italian soldiers at Sciara Sciat in order to justify their revenge.  Treaty of Ouchy Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey led the Turkish delegation at Lausanne (1912). Turkish and Italian delegations at Lausanne (1912). From left to right (seating): Pietro Bertolini, Mehmet Nabi Bey, Guido Fusinato, Rumbeyoƒülu Fahreddin Bey, and Giuseppe Volpi. Italian diplomats decided to take advantage of the situation to obtain a favourable peace deal. On October 18, 1912, Italy and the Ottoman Empire signed a treaty in Ouchy in Lausanne called The First Treaty of Lausanne, often also called Treaty of Ouchy to distinguish it from the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, (The second Treaty of Lausanne).Treaty of Peace Between Italy and Turkey The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 7, No. 1, Supplement: Official Documents (Jan., 1913), pp. 58‚Äì62 The main provisions of the treaty were as follows: * The Ottomans would withdraw all military personnel from Trablus and Benghazi vilayets (Libya) but in return, Italy would return Rhodes and the other Aegean islands it held back to the Turks. * Trablus and Benghazi vilayets would have a special status and a naib (regent) and a kadi (judge) would represent the Caliph. * Before the appointment of these kadis and naibs, the Ottomans would consult the Italian government. * The Ottoman government would be responsible for the expenses of these kadis and naibs. Subsequent events prevented the return of the Dodecanese to Turkey, however. The First Balkan War broke out shortly before the treaty was signed. Turkey was in no position to reoccupy the islands while its main armies were engaged in a bitter struggle to preserve its remaining territories in the Balkans; hence, it was implicitly agreed on that the Dodecanese would remain under Italian administration until the conclusion of hostilities between Greece and Turkey, after which the islands would revert to Turkish rule. Turkey's continued involvement in the Balkan Wars, followed shortly by World War I (which found Turkey and Italy again on opposing sides), meant that the islands were never returned to the Ottoman Empire. Turkey gave up its claims on the islands in the Treaty of Lausanne, and the Dodecanese continued to be administered by Italy until 1947, when after their defeat in World War II, the islands were ceded to Greece. Aftermath Italian Alpini and Libyan corpses after the attack against \\"Ridotta Lombardia\\". The invasion of Libya was a costly enterprise for Italy. Instead of the 30 million lire a month judged sufficient at its beginning, it reached a cost of 80 million a month for a much longer period than was originally estimated. The war cost Italy 1.3 billion lire, nearly a billion more than Giovanni Giolitti estimated before the war. This ruined ten years of fiscal prudence.Mark I. Choate: Emigrant nation: the making of Italy abroad, Harvard University Press, 2008, , page 175. After the withdrawal of the Ottoman army the Italians could easily extend their occupation of the country, seizing East Tripolitania, Ghadames, the Djebel and Fezzan with Murzuk during 1913.Bertarelli (1929), p. 206. The outbreak of the First World War with the necessity to bring back the troops to Italy, the proclamation of the Jihad by the Ottomans and the uprising of the Libyans in Tripolitania forced the Italians to abandon all occupied territory and to entrench themselves in Tripoli, Derna, and on the coast of Cyrenaica. The Italian control over much of the interior of Libya remained ineffective until the late 1920s, when forces under the Generals Pietro Badoglio and Rodolfo Graziani waged bloody pacification campaigns. Resistance petered out only after the execution of the rebel leader Omar Mukhtar on September 15, 1931. The result of the Italian colonisation for the Libyan population was that by the mid-1930s it had been cut in half due to emigration, famine, and war casualties. The Libyan population in 1950 was at the same level as in 1911, approximately 1.5 million.The Libyan Economy: Economic Diversification and International Repositioning, Waniss Otman, Erling Karlberg, page 13  Europe, the Balkans, and the First World War  In 1924, the Serbian diplomat Miroslav Spalajkoviƒá could look back on the events that led to the First World War and its aftermath and state of the Italian attack, \\"all subsequent events are nothing more than the evolution of that first aggression.\\"Clark, pp.243-244 Unlike British-controlled Egypt and French-influenced Morocco, the Ottoman Tripolitania vilayet that made up modern-day Libya were core territory of the Empire, like that of the Balkans.Clark, pp.243 The coalition that had defended the Ottomans during the Crimean War (1853-1856), minimized Ottoman territorial losses at the Congress of Berlin (1878), and supported the Empire during the Bulgarian Crisis (1885‚Äì88) had largely disappeared.Clark, p. 250 The reaction in the Balkans to the Italian declaration of war was immediate. The first draft by Serbia of a military treaty with Bulgaria against Turkey was written by November 1911, with a defensive treaty signed in March 1912, and an offensive treaty signed in May 1912 focused on military action against Ottoman south-east Europe. The series of bilateral treaties between Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro that created the Balkan League was completed in 1912, with the First Balkan War (1912-1913) beginning with a Montenegrin attack on 8 October 1912, ten days before Treaty of Lausanne.Clark, pp. 251-252 The swift and nearly complete victory of the Balkan League astonished contemporary observers.Clark, p. 252 However, the Serbs were unhappy with the division of captured territory and continued to hold areas promised to Bulgaria, resulting in the Second Balkan War (1913), in which Serbia, Greece, the Ottomans, and Romania took almost all of the territory that Bulgaria had captured in the first war.Clark, pp. 256-258 In the wake of this enormous change in the regional balance of power, Russia switched its primary allegiance in the region from Bulgaria to Serbia, guaranteeing Serbian autonomy from any outside military intervention. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Serbian nationalist and the resulting Austrian plan for military action against Serbia is the oft-stated precipitating event of World War I (1914-1918) The Italo-Turkish War illustrated to France and Great Britain that Italy was more valuable to them inside the Triple Alliance, rather than formally allied with the Entente. In January 1912, French diplomat Paul Cambon wrote to Raymond Poincar√© that Italy was \\"more burdensome than useful as an ally. Against Austria, she harbours a latent hostility that nothing can disarm.\\"Clark, p. 249 The tensions within the Triple Alliance would eventually lead Italy to sign the 1915 Treaty of London abandoning the Triple Alliance and joining the Entente. In Italy itself, massive funerals for fallen heroes brought the Catholic Church closer to the government from which it had long been alienated. There emerged a cult of patriotic sacrifice, in which the colonial war was celebrated in an aggressive and imperialistic way. The ideology of \\"crusade\\" and \\"martyrdom\\" characterized the funerals. The result was to consolidate Catholic war culture among devout Italians, which was soon expanded to include the world war (1915‚Äì18). This aggressive spirit was revived by the Fascists in the 1920s to strengthen their popular support.Matteo Caponi, \\"Liturgie funebri e sacrificio patriottico I riti di suffragio per i caduti nella guerra di Libia (1911-1912).\\"[\\"Funeral Liturgies and Patriotic Sacrifices: The Rites for the Souls of Those Who Fell in the War of Libya (1911-1912)\\"] Rivista di storia del cristianesimo 10.2 (2013) 437-459  Fate of the Dodecanese Islands  Because of World War I, the Dodecanese remained under Italian military occupation. According to the 1920 Treaty of S√®vres, which was never ratified, Italy was supposed to cede all of the islands except Rhodes to Greece, in exchange for a vast Italian zone of influence in southwest Anatolia. However, the Greek defeat in the Greco‚ÄìTurkish War and the foundation of modern Turkey created a new situation that made the enforcement of the terms of this treaty impossible. In article 15 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which superseded the 1920 Treaty of S√®vres, Turkey formally recognized the Italian annexation of the Dodecanese. The population was largely Greek, and by treaty in 1947 the islands eventually became part of Greece.P.J.

De Casteljau's algorithm can also be used to split a single B√©zier curve into two B√©zier curves at an arbitrary parameter value. Although the algorithm is slower for most architectures when compared with the direct approach, it is more numerically stable. Definition A B√©zier curve B (of degree n, with control points \\\\beta_0, \\\\ldots, \\\\beta_n) can be written in Bernstein form as follows :B(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\\\beta_{i}b_{i,n}(t) , where b is a Bernstein basis polynomial : b_{i,n}(t) = {n \\\\choose i}(1-t)^{n-i}t^i. The curve at point t0 can be evaluated with the recurrence relation :\\\\beta_i^{(0)} := \\\\beta_i \\\\mbox{ , } i=0,\\\\ldots,n :\\\\beta_i^{(j)} := \\\\beta_i^{(j-1)} (1-t_0) + \\\\beta_{i+1}^{(j-1)} t_0 \\\\mbox{ , } i = 0,\\\\ldots,n-j \\\\mbox{ , } j= 1,\\\\ldots,n Then, the evaluation of B at point t_0 can be evaluated in \\\\binom{n}{2} operations. The result B(t_0) is given by: :B(t_0)=\\\\beta_0^{(n)}. Moreover, the B√©zier curve B can be split at point t_0 into two curves with respective control points: :\\\\beta_0^{(0)},\\\\beta_0^{(1)},\\\\ldots,\\\\beta_0^{(n)} :\\\\beta_0^{(n)},\\\\beta_1^{(n-1)},\\\\ldots,\\\\beta_n^{(0)}  Example implementation  Here is an example implementation of De Casteljau's algorithm in Haskell: deCasteljau :: Double -> [(Double, Double)] -> (Double, Double) deCasteljau t [b] = b deCasteljau t coefs = deCasteljau t reduced where reduced = zipWith (lerpP t) coefs (tail coefs) lerpP t (x0, y0) (x1, y1) = (lerp t x0 x1, lerp t y0 y1) lerp t a b = t * b + (1 - t) * a Notes When doing the calculation by hand it is useful to write down the coefficients in a triangle scheme as : \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\beta_0 & = \\\\beta_0^{(0)} & & & \\\\ & & \\\\beta_0^{(1)} & & \\\\ \\\\beta_1 & = \\\\beta_1^{(0)} & & & \\\\ & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots & & \\\\beta_0^{(n)} \\\\ & & & & \\\\ \\\\beta_{n-1} & = \\\\beta_{n-1}^{(0)} & & & \\\\ & & \\\\beta_{n-1}^{(1)} & & \\\\ \\\\beta_n & = \\\\beta_n^{(0)} & & & \\\\ \\\\end{matrix} When choosing a point t0 to evaluate a Bernstein polynomial we can use the two diagonals of the triangle scheme to construct a division of the polynomial :B(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\beta_i^{(0)} b_{i,n}(t) \\\\mbox{ , } \\\\qquad t \\\\in [0,1] into :B_1(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\beta_0^{(i)} b_{i,n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{t}{t_0}\\\\right) \\\\mbox{ , } \\\\qquad t \\\\in [0,t_0] and :B_2(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\beta_i^{(n-i)} b_{i,n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{t-t_0}{1-t_0}\\\\right) \\\\mbox{ , } \\\\qquad t \\\\in [t_0,1] Example We want to evaluate the Bernstein polynomial of degree 2 with the Bernstein coefficients :\\\\beta_0^{(0)} = \\\\beta_0 :\\\\beta_1^{(0)} = \\\\beta_1 :\\\\beta_2^{(0)} = \\\\beta_2 at the point t0. We start the recursion with :\\\\beta_0^{(1)} = \\\\beta_0^{(0)} (1-t_0) + \\\\beta_1^{(0)}t_0 = \\\\beta_0(1-t_0) + \\\\beta_1 t_0 :\\\\beta_1^{(1)} = \\\\beta_1^{(0)} (1-t_0) + \\\\beta_2^{(0)}t_0 = \\\\beta_1(1-t_0) + \\\\beta_2 t_0 and with the second iteration the recursion stops with : \\\\begin{align} \\\\beta_0^{(2)} & = \\\\beta_0^{(1)} (1-t_0) + \\\\beta_1^{(1)} t_0 \\\\ \\\\ & = \\\\beta_0(1-t_0) (1-t_0) + \\\\beta_1 t_0 (1-t_0) + \\\\beta_1(1-t_0)t_0 + \\\\beta_2 t_0 t_0 \\\\ \\\\ & = \\\\beta_0 (1-t_0)^2 + \\\\beta_1 2t_0(1-t_0) + \\\\beta_2 t_0^2 \\\\end{align} which is the expected Bernstein polynomial of degree 2\\\\. B√©zier curve A B√©zier curve When evaluating a B√©zier curve of degree n in 3-dimensional space with n+1 control points Pi :\\\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\\\mathbf{P}_i b_{i,n}(t) \\\\mbox{ , } t \\\\in [0,1] with :\\\\mathbf{P}_i := \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_i \\\\ y_i \\\\ z_i \\\\end{pmatrix} . we split the B√©zier curve into three separate equations :B_1(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i b_{i,n}(t) \\\\mbox{ , } t \\\\in [0,1] :B_2(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n} y_i b_{i,n}(t) \\\\mbox{ , } t \\\\in [0,1] :B_3(t) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n} z_i b_{i,n}(t) \\\\mbox{ , } t \\\\in [0,1] which we evaluate individually using De Casteljau's algorithm. Geometric interpretation The geometric interpretation of De Casteljau's algorithm is straightforward. *Consider a B√©zier curve with control points \\\\scriptstyle P_0,...,P_n. Connecting the consecutive points we create the control polygon of the curve. *Subdivide now each line segment of this polygon with the ratio \\\\scriptstyle t : (1-t) and connect the points you get. This way you arrive at the new polygon having one fewer segment. *Repeat the process until you arrive at the single point ‚Äì this is the point of the curve corresponding to the parameter \\\\scriptstyle t. The following picture shows this process for a cubic B√©zier curve: Image:DeCasteljau1.svg Note that the intermediate points that were constructed are in fact the control points for two new B√©zier curves, both exactly coincident with the old one. This algorithm not only evaluates the curve at \\\\scriptstyle t, but splits the curve into two pieces at \\\\scriptstyle t, and provides the equations of the two sub-curves in B√©zier form. The interpretation given above is valid for a nonrational B√©zier curve. To evaluate a rational B√©zier curve in \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{R}^n, we may project the point into \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{R}^{n+1}; for example, a curve in three dimensions may have its control points \\\\scriptstyle {(x_i, y_i, z_i)} and weights \\\\scriptstyle {w_i} projected to the weighted control points \\\\scriptstyle {(w_ix_i, w_iy_i, w_iz_i, w_i)}. The algorithm then proceeds as usual, interpolating in \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{R}^4. The resulting four-dimensional points may be projected back into three-space with a perspective divide. In general, operations on a rational curve (or surface) are equivalent to operations on a nonrational curve in a projective space. This representation as the \\"weighted control points\\" and weights is often convenient when evaluating rational curves.

It was used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War from early 1943 until the end of the war. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz 165 The full name was Panzerfeldhaubitze 18M auf Gesch√ºtzwagen III/IV (Sf) Hummel, Sd.Kfz. 165. On February 27, 1944, Hitler ordered the name Hummel to be dropped as it was deemed inappropriate for a fighting vehicle. Development A battery of Hummel howitzers ready for firing, central-southern Russia, June 1943 The Hummel was designed in 1942 after the need for mobile artillery support for tank forces had been demonstrated during the invasion of the USSR. The self- propelled artillery already in service with the Wehrmacht had proven of limited value. The first option considered was mounting a 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer on a Panzer III chassis, rejected in favour of the same gun on a Panzer IV chassis. One prototype was built. This design was rejected in favour of mounting the more powerful 15 cm sFH 18 L/30 howitzer on the specially designed Gesch√ºtzwagen III/IV, which combined elements of both the Panzer III (driving and steering system) and Panzer IV chassis (suspension and engine). The same chassis was also used for the Nashorn tank destroyer. The engine was moved to the centre of the vehicle to make room for an open-topped lightly armoured fighting compartment at the Rear housing the gun and crew. Late models had a slightly redesigned driver compartment and front superstructure offering more room to the radio operator and driver. Variants A Hummel passes through a town in southern Russia Because the basic Hummel could carry only a limited amount of ammunition, the Munitionstr√§ger Hummel (\\"ammunition carrier Hummel\\") was developed. This was basically a standard production Hummel without the howitzer (a 10 mm armour plate covering the gun mount) and with racks fitted to hold the ammunition. When necessary, these could still be fitted with the 15 cm howitzer of the normal Hummel; this could even be done as a field conversion. By the end of the war, 714 Hummel had been built together with 150 ammunition carriers using the same design. Combat history A Hummel navigates a hill in central-southern Russia (June 1943) The Hummel first participated in large scale combat at the Battle of Kursk, when some 100 served in armored artillery battalions (Panzerartillerie Abteilungen) of the Panzer divisions. They were formed into separate heavy self-propelled artillery batteries, each with six Hummel and one ammunition carrier. Foreign use Romania received one unit from the Red Army after the war ended. This was assigned to the 2nd Armoured Regiment with its military registration number as U069009. It was officially known as the Hummel TAs self-propelled gun in the army's inventory. The gun could not be used because it was missing the breech's lock.Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.47 It was showcased to the public in a military parade in Bucharest of 10 May 1946 with Romanian markings. All German armour in Romania was later phased out in 1950 and finally scrapped by 1954, the army deciding on the wholly use of Soviet tanks and armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) instead. Besides Romania, Syria was also another user of the Hummel post-WWII. Five were received from France, which captured several from Germany after the war, between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, with a limited supply of main gun ammunition obtained together with the vehicles (later on, the Soviets provided these Syrian Hummels a sizeable quantity of 150mm rounds they produced domestically following WWII). These saw service against Israel up until the 1960s and all were most likely scrapped shortly afterwards.

The concept for this powdered candy originated in 1942 and was derived from a penny drink mix sold as Fruzola Jr. by the Fruzola Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. When J. Fish Smith found that children were eating the sweet and sour powder straight from the package, he modified the formula and branded it as Lik-M-Aid. An affiliated company, Fruzola Company of St. Louis, which later became Sunline, Inc., was founded in 1952 by Menlo F. Smith to manufacture and market Lik-M-Aid nationwide. In 1959, the product was packaged in color-striped straws and introduced as Pixy Stix. Several years later, Lik-M-Aid was modified with a multi-compartment package containing two flavors and a candy stick used to dip the candy out of the package, thereby dubbed Fun Dip.

He is a guitarist and vocalist, known principally as a founder, guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter for the rock group the Doobie Brothers, as well as for his own solo career. He has played off and on with the Doobie Brothers for 50 years, in several styles. Musical career Johnston is most well known for both his lead guitar and vocal role in the Doobie Brothers, as well as for his adaptation of his own acoustic guitar style, blending a unique strum and percussive accented rhythm at the same time on one instrument. This style, interwoven with melodic hammer-ons, gave Johnston an early signature sound inside of popular 1970s rock music. All the rhythm structures behind \\"Long Train Runnin'\\" and \\"Listen to the Music\\" were formulated first for an acoustic guitar, and then re-applied in similar style on an electric guitar. Early years to 1975 Johnston was born in Visalia, California. His greatest musical influences during his youth included Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Elvis Presley, James Brown, and other rhythm and blues artists featured on the radio in the 1950s. After brief school stints with the saxophone and clarinet, at the age of twelve Johnston took up guitar. He said, \\"I started out [on] the clarinet at seven, and I played that for eight years. I also played the saxophone for three years, drums for a year and a half, and took up the guitar when I was in the seventh grade. That was pretty much of a rebellion/image trip. But I felt at home on the guitar. I loved the saxophone and played tenor and baritone. But unfortunately, when I hung the clarinet up, I hung up all the reed instruments and just started playing guitar, and I never touched them again. I taught myself guitar and a little piano at home. I played piano on the first album The Doobie Brothers, and a little harmonica on a few others.\\" In his early career he played in a variety of bands, including a Mexican wedding band that played half soul and half Latin music. His interest in rhythm and blues led to his singing in a soul group from a neighboring town and, eventually, his own blues band. Johnston moved to San Jose to finish college and started playing in bands around town. It was there that he met Skip Spence, a former drummer with Jefferson Airplane, and guitarist/founding member of a group that had a major influence on the Doobie Brothers ‚Äì Moby Grape. Spence introduced Johnston to John Hartman. Johnston was a graphic design art major at San Jos√© State University and wound up living at 285 South 12th Street, which was a musical center for San Jose at the time. \\"It didn't matter if they played B-3 or drums, guitar, bass, or horns, they all ended up in our basement,\\" Johnston recalls. Johnston and Hartman soon formed their own band, Pud, featuring Greg Murphy on bass. Pud played many clubs in and around San Jose, including the Golden Horn Lounge (which no longer exists) in Cupertino, California. Here they met Pat Simmons. Hartman and Johnston lived in the 12th Street house for about four years; whereupon Dave Shogren joined them to replace Greg Murphy and Pat Simmons was recruited, they had the nucleus of a new band, and Pud gave way to the Doobie Brothers. Throughout much of an initial seven-year and six-album discography, Johnston wrote and sang many of the Doobie Brothers' early hits, including \\"Listen to the Music\\" (#11 Top 100 Billboard Hit ‚àí1972), \\"Rockin' Down the Highway,\\" \\"China Grove\\" (#15 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), \\"Long Train Runnin'\\" (#8 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), \\"Another Park, Another Sunday\\" (#32 Billboard Hot 100 Hit), and \\"Eyes of Silver\\" (#52 Billboard Hot 100 Hit). He also sang the hit song \\"Take Me in Your Arms\\" (#11 Billboard Hot 100 Hit ‚àí1975) (written by Holland-Dozier- Holland). Mid and solo years 1976‚Äì1987 Tommy Johnston Toys for Tots Concert Atlanta, Georgia Dec 1980 In December 1973, the British music magazine NME reported the relatively trivial news that Johnston had been arrested in California on a charge of marijuana possession. More seriously however, following years of a road touring lifestyle and health issues surrounding stomach ulcers which stood as a challenge since high school, Johnston became severely ill on the eve of a major tour beginning in Memphis, Tennessee in 1975 to promote Stampede. Johnston's condition was so precarious that he required emergency hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer. With Johnston convalescing and the tour already underway, fellow Doobie Brother Jeff Baxter proposed recruiting a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole.The Doobie Brothers This led to the emergency hiring of Michael McDonald, who became the lead singer of the band. Restored to fitness in 1976 and briefly back in the band, Johnston contributed one original song to Takin' It to the Streets (\\"Turn It Loose\\"), and also added a vocal cameo to Pat Simmons' tune \\"Wheels of Fortune\\". He also made live appearances with the band in 1976 (appearing in a concert filmed that year at Winterland in San Francisco, excerpts from which appear occasionally on VH1 Classic), but was sidelined once again in the fall due to exhaustion. None of Johnston's songs appeared on Livin' on the Fault Line, though he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album. Finally, before Fault Line was released, Johnston had his songs removed and left the band that he co-founded (though he received credit for guitars and vocals and was pictured on the album's inner sleeve band photo). After a few years of restored health but growing differences in musical direction between band members, Johnston finally left the band in 1977 to pursue a solo career that produced two albums with Warner Bros: Everything You've Heard Is True and Still Feels Good (reissued on compact disc by Wounded Bird Records), and Billboard Hot 100 hit \\"Savannah Nights\\" (#34 Top 100 Billboard Hit ‚àí1980). Johnston toured in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Tom Johnston Band, which featured fellow Doobie John Hartman on drums. While working on his solo projects, in 1982 Johnston rejoined the band for a farewell tour concert, after which the Doobie Brothers ceased performing as a band for the next five years. In 1985, Johnston toured US clubs with a group called Border Patrol, that also included former Doobies Michael Hossack and briefly Patrick Simmons. This group toured but never recorded. In 1987, he contributed a tune to the Dirty Dancing soundtrack entitled \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" Current years 1987‚Äìpresent Doobie Brothers (Pat Simmons and John McFee, incl.) performing together Johnston joined the Doobie Brothers when they reunited for a brief tour in 1987. This event led to the permanent reformation of the band, with Johnston again performing alongside co-founder Simmons. Johnston co-wrote, sang and contributed a signature guitar solo to the group's last major chart hit, \\"The Doctor\\" (from 1989's Cycles). This was followed by the album Brotherhood in 1991 which featured four songs by Johnston, and Sibling Rivalry in 2000 featuring the single \\"People Gotta Love Again\\". The Doobies' most recent album, 2010's World Gone Crazy, features 13 songs, eight of which were written by Johnston including the album's title track and the first single \\"Nobody\\", a rerecording of the band's first single in 1971. Road and studio gear outfitting \\"Mine [first guitar] was an arch- back Harmony acoustic with f-holes. After that I got a Kay single-pickup electric with a cheap amplifier as that's all I could afford. Johnston now owns a mid-50s Fender Stratocaster that has been in his collection since the 1970s. He has a 1970 Les Paul Deluxe goldtop with classic white P-90 'soapbar' pickups affixed with an American Flag, that has been his primary Les Paul for 40 years. He also relies upon a 2008 PRS Custom 24 as a touring backup for his primary PRS. His primary touring guitar is a 2009 PRS 25th Anniversary Custom 24. It has a Modern Eagle inlay on the headstock and 57/08 pickups. \\"I've got a lot of guitars. Basically, everything I use on the road is PRS and that is what I play live. I use two basic guitars live that I trade off and I have a Martin acoustic that I play as well live. It is pretty much all about Paul Reed Smith right now. At home I have a Stratocaster and I have some older guitars I have had for a long time, an old Les Paul, an old 335, a couple Strats and a Telecaster. But live and when I am out on the road, it is strictly PRS.\\" While primarily an electric guitarist, Johnston also plays acoustic guitars for exploration and song writing. He started with a Gibson J-50 which was used to record all acoustic guitar parts on the first four Doobie Brother albums and after it was stolen moved to Martin guitars. In his personal collection are a 1962 Martin 00‚Äì18 and a 1975 Martin D-42, and he has written various songs on the 00-18. Johnston uses a variety of software in his home studio for writing, and Digital Performer by MOTU as his recording software program. Johnston has employed traditionally a three finger Clapton- Hendrix lead fingerstyle, only using all four fingers for barre chords. He said, \\"I use my little finger to play chords, but not for playing solos. The direction in which I bend a string depends on where the string I'm bending is on the neck. The lower strings are going to be pulled down, and the high strings are going to be pushed up. I use a lot of vibrato when I play solo. And for picking, it has to be up and down if you want to do a lot of speed. It's also better for clarity. Anything faster than quarter notes, you either have to use alternating picking or play with a regular flatpick and fingers.\\" Johnston has traditionally employed Herco Nylon Flex 50 flatpicks (old \\"Herco mediums\\"),https://www.jimdunlop.com/product/he210p-7-10137-01950-8 allowing for the right combination of flex and durability for his chukka-style rhythm. He said \\"I always use Herco medium because they don't break, and they take forever to wear out. Actually the worst thing you can do with a Herco is lose it. They are easy to hold on to as well and I do sweat a lot playing live. In fact, I usually eat the nickel off the strings right down to the brass (circa 1976).\\" In 2007 C.F. Martin & Co. released a limited run of 35 Tom Johnston Signature Edition Doobie-42 Artist Edition guitars, and Elderly Music Tom Johnston Doobie 42. Personal life Johnston and his wife Diane now live in northern Marin County, California. His daughter Lara Johnston is a singer- songwriter. She has toured both as a solo act opening for the bands KISS and Heart, and as a backing vocalist for Don Henley and Belinda Carlisle. She was a competitor on MTV's Rock the Cradle and was a 2011 participant in American Idol. Tom Johnston's son Christopher lives and works in Marin.

He is widely considered one of the greatest Filipino literary laureates for his impact on Filipino literature. The famous epic Florante at Laura is regarded as his defining work. The surname \\"Baltazar\\", sometimes misconstrued as a pen name, was a legal surname Balagtas adopted after the 1849 edict of Governor- General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua, which mandated that the native population adopt standard Spanish surnames instead of native ones. His surname is also sometimes given as \\"Balagtas Baltazar\\" when instead he used one or the other but not both at the same time. His mentor was Jos√© de la Cruz, otherwise known as Huseng Sisiw.  Early life  Francisco Balagtas was born on April 2, 1788, in Barrio Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan, formerly Bigaa. He was the youngest of the four children of Juan Balagtas, a blacksmith, and Juana de la Cruz. He was baptized on April 30 that same year. He studied Canon Law, Philosophy, Latin, and the Classics in Colegio San Juan de Letran and Colegio de San Jose. He finished school in 1811  Life as a poet  Balagtas learned to write poetry from Jos√© de la Cruz (Joseng Sisiw), one of the most famous poets of Tondo, in return for chicks. It was De la Cruz himself who personally challenged Balagtas to improve his writing. Balagtas swore he would overcome Huseng Sisiw as he would not ask for anything in return as a poet. In 1835, Balagtas moved to Pandacan, Manila, where he met Mar√≠a Asunci√≥n Rivera, who would effectively serve as the muse for his future works. She is referenced in Florante at Laura as 'Selya' and 'MAR'. Balagtas' affections for MAR were challenged by the influential Mariano Capule. The latter won the battle for MAR when he used his wealth to get Balagtas imprisoned. It was here that he wrote Florante at Laura‚Äîin fact, the events of this poem were meant to parallel his own situation. He wrote his poems in the Tagalog language, during an age when Filipino writing was predominantly written in Spanish. Balagtas published \\"Florante at Laura\\" upon his release in 1838. He moved to Balanga, Bataan, in 1840 where he served as the assistant to the Justice of the Peace. He was also appointed as the translator of the court. He married Juana Tiambeng on July 22, 1842, in a ceremony officiated by Fr. Cayetano Arellano, uncle of future Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the Philippines‚ÄîChief Justice Arellano. They had eleven children but only four survived to adulthood. On November 21, 1849, Governor General Narciso Claver√≠a y Zaldua issued a decree that every Filipino native must adopt a Spanish surname. In 1856, he was appointed as the Major Lieutenant, but soon after was convicted and sent to prison again in Bataan under the accusation that he ordered Alferez Lucas' housemaid's head to be shaved. He sold his land and all of his riches, in order for him to be imprisoned in 1861, and continued writing poetry, along with translating Spanish documents, but he died a year later‚Äîon February 20, 1862, at the age of 73. Upon his deathbed, he asked the favor that none of his children become poets like him, who had suffered under his gift as well as under others. He even went as far as to tell them it would be better to cut their hands off than let them be writers. Balagtas is greatly idolized in the Philippines that the term for Filipino debate in extemporaneous verse is named after him: Balagtasan.  Legacy  \\"Pook na Sinilangan ni Balagtas\\" Monument in Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan An elementary school was erected in honor of Balagtas, the Francisco Balagtas Elementary School (FBES), located along Alvarez Street in Santa Cruz, Manila. There is also a plaza and park (Plaza Balagtas) erected in Pandacan, Manila while most of the streets were named after various Florante at Laura characters in honor of Francisco Balagtas. His birthplace, Bigaa, Bulacan, was renamed to Balagtas, Bulacan in his memory. A museum, historical marker, monument and elementary school has been placed in his birthplace at Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan. The former Folk Arts Theater in Manila was renamed to Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas to honor Balagtas. Mercurian crater was also named after him. The barangay of Udyong in Orion, Bataan was also renamed Balagtas. On April 2, 2018, Google celebrated Balagtas' 230th birthday celebration with a Google Doodle.http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/02/18/google-celebrates- balagtas-230th-birthday-with-special-doodlehttps://www.rappler.com/life-and- style/arts-and-culture/199363-google-doodle-francisco-balagtas-birth- anniversary  Works   Sources of Balagtas' work  No original manuscript in Balagtas' handwriting of any of his works has survived to the present day. This is due mainly to two great fires that razed Udyong (Now Balagtas in Orion, Bataan) and destroyed much of the poet's works. The most notable of his works, \\"Florante at Laura\\" or \\"Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya\\" has been published in numerous editions from its original publication in 1838. The oldest extant edition of the Florante is believed to be the 1861 editionhttps://trixiesolis.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/florante-at-laura.pdf published in Manila, while a handwritten manuscript written down by Apolinario Mabini exists and is in the possession of the Philippine National Library. The major source of the poet's life and works is from a 20th-century work entitled \\"Kun Sino ang Kumatha ng Florante\\" (He who wrote the Florante) by Hermenigildo Cruz. The poet lists down Balagtas' works and recreates some of his plays based on scenes and lines memorized by the poet's children. The book also has an edition of the Florante. Balagtas wrote ten (10) comedias and one (1) metrical romance according to Cruz as well as numerous other poems and short plays that are recorded in his book. These include two (2) laos or short celebratory scenes usually involving a patron saint and performed during fiestas.  Complete works  Only 3 of Balagtas' works survived complete and intact to this day. Out of the 3, \\"Florante at Laura\\" is considered Balagtas' defining work and is a cultural touchstone for the Philippines. *Florante at Laura or Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya, an awit (metrical narrative poem with dodecasyllabic quatrains [12 syllables per line, 4 lines per stanza]); Balagtas' masterpiece *La India elegante y el negrito amante ‚Äì a short play in one part *Orosman at Zafira ‚Äì a comedia in three parts  Reconstructed/rediscovered works  Majority of the source material for Balagtas' work come from Hermenigildo Cruz' book which itself is based on the surviving testimonies and memories of Balagtas' children at the turn of the century. In his book, he reconstructs five (5) plays. *Rodolfo at Rosemonda *Nudo gordeano *Abdol at Misereanan ‚Äì a komedya, staged in Abucay, Bataan in 1857 *Bayaceto at Dorslica ‚Äì a komedya in three parts, staged at Udyong on September 27, 1857  Minor works  As a folk poet and employee of the courts, Balagtas' prowess in writing was mainly seen in the yearly fiestas held in nearby towns, a great majority of his plays may have been staged in outdoor theaters set up in town squares and as a poet, a number of his works and writings have been recorded in collections of poetry such as the \\"Coleccion de refranes, frases y modismos tagalos\\" (Guadalupe, 1890) as well as in the accounts of Spanish officials such as Martinez de Zuniga who recorded traditional plays and religious events in Philippine fiestas. Balagtas also wrote in the Ladino style of poems that were popular among his contemporaries. He is said to have written two (2) loas recorded in Cruz's book as well as numerous Ladinos and didactic works. = Loas = *In praise of the Archangel Michael a loa written for the patron saint of the town of Udyong *In Celebration of the crowning of Queen Isabella II of the Bourbon Dynasty Celebrating the ascension of Isabella II to the Spanish throne  Minor poems  A number of Minor poems are recorded in Cruz's book. *\\"Pangaral sa Isang Binibining Ikakasal\\" (Admonition to a Young Lady About To Be Married) A didactic work. *\\"Paalam Na sa Iyo. . .!\\" (And So Farewell to You... !) A bilingual poem (Written in Spanish and Tagalog) written in Ladino style.  Lost works  Five (5) of the ten (10) plays Balagtas wrote as recorded by Cruz are considered lost. Another work, \\"Claus\\" a translation work from Latin is considered lost for Cruz does not mention any fragments or elaborates on it in his book, Eufronio Alip's 1930 Tagalog literary history mentions the same book.https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/AEG8734.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext Among his other lost works, one should consider plays and short poems written by Balagtas in his lifetime for fiestas and celebrations as well as to earn his living. Eufronio Alip, in his 1930 historical study on Tagalog literature, also provides an additional two (2) titles of plays by Balagtas. *Don Nu√±o at Selinda o la desgracia del amor en la inocencia ‚Äì a komedya in three parts *Auredato at Astrome ‚Äì a komedya in three parts *Clara Belmore ‚Äì a komedya in three parts *Alamansor at Rosalinda ‚Äì a komedya staged at Udyong during the town's feast *Mahomet at Constanza *Claus (translated into Tagalog from Latin) *La Eleccion del Gobernadorcillo ‚Äì a komedya in prose, in five parts *Mariang Makiling ‚Äì a komedya in nine parts  References   External links  *Francisco Balagtas at An Online Guide About the Philippine History * * Baltazar, Francisco Baltazar, Francisco Category:Writers from Bulacan Category:People from Pandacan Category:Colegio de San Juan de Letran alumni Category:Filipino writers Category:Tagalog-language writers Category:19th- century Filipino poets Category:Filipino male poets Category:19th-century male writers ","title":"Francisco Balagtas"},{"id":"656116","text":"Julio Segundo Machado Rond√≥n (December 1, 1965 in San Carlos del Zulia, Venezuela) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed relief pitcher who played for the New York Mets (1989‚Äì90) and Milwaukee Brewers (1990‚Äì91). Machado's MLB career was cut short when he was imprisoned on voluntary murder charges in Venezuela. He later coached and played in Venezuelan winter baseball leagues. MLB career Machado started his career with the Mets. He made his MLB debut in and started the season with the Mets as well. He was demoted to the Class AAA Tidewater team, where he saved eight games before being recalled to the Mets in July. At the time, the Mets were looking for consistent right-handed relief pitchers, having traded Roger McDowell the previous year. Later that season, Machado was traded to the Brewers, along with pitcher Kevin Brown, in exchange for catcher Charlie O'Brien and a minor league player. Machado had a decent fastball, good control and willingness to challenge hitters. He also pitched a better-than-average curveball and a slider. In a three-year career, Machado posted a 7‚Äì5 record with 151 strikeouts and a 3.12 ERA in 147 innings. Shooting Spending the 1991 offseason in his homeland, Machado fatally shot a woman following an auto accident on December 8. More than two weeks later, Machado was missing and the Brewers said they that they were planning for 1992 with the assumption that Machado would not be on the team. Though he was described as a fugitive, Venezuelan reporters said that Machado would probably turn himself in after the holidays. He was held in a Caracas prison while an investigation was carried out from the middle of January to early March. He admitted that he fired the shots, but he said that he did so in self-defense, afraid that he was being robbed. When Machado was granted conditional freedom pending a trial on charges of involuntary murder, he was not allowed to leave Venezuela. Shortly thereafter, thieves stole the car of the prosecutor in Machado's case and they set it on fire. He was convicted and, following appeals, Machado was sentenced to 12 years in 1996. Later life Machado went on to play in the Venezuelan winter league and currently coaches in that league.

Population (1999): 14,592 (Mussipontains). It is an industrial town (mainly steel industry), situated on the Moselle River. Pont-√†-Mousson has several historical monuments, including the 18th century Premonstratensian abbey. Demographics History Early Modern In 1572 Cardinal Charles of Lorraine established a Jesuit university at Pont-√†-Mousson. With the Protestant revolution building in the German-speaking lands, still part of the Holy Roman Empire, directly to the east, and the Duchy of Lorraine vulnerable to pressure from an increasingly assertive French state directly to the west, the Duchy participated in the wars of religion on the side of the Counter-Reformation. The Tridentine strategy promulgated by the Holy See involved the creation of a \\"Roman Catholic backbone\\" (sometimes termed the Lotharingian axis from the territories, including Lorraine, between France and the Habsburg Empire). During the seventeenth century the university grew rapidly until there were about 2,000 students. There were four faculties covering theology, the arts, law and medicine. Students were drawn from across western and central Europe. Over time a rivalry grew up between students in the St Martin district, located on the right-bank of the river and dominated by Jesuits, and the left-bank students based in the St Laurent quarter and considered the rowdier of the two student tribes. Rivalry peaked with the violent \\"printers' battles\\" when the rival factions were known respectively as the \\"Ponti Mussoni\\" and the \\"Mussiponti\\". The \\"Mussiponti\\" won, and in the region the inhabitants of the town became known thereafter as \\"Mussipontains/Mussipontines\\". 18th and 19th centuries The region became French following the death in 1766 of Duke Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski of Lorraine, and in 1769 Louis XV had the Jesuit Academy transferred to Nancy. The only notable educational establishment remaining at Pont-√†-Mousson was a military training school. The town continued to flourish as a centre of the visual arts, however, rivalling √âpinal to the south in this respect. A papier m√¢ch√© factory also contributed to the cultural development of Pont-√†-Mousson. It was the regional capital between 1790 and 1795, but underwent extensive destruction in the ensuing wars, and was subject to foreign occupation in 1814 and 1815. During the Franco-Prussian War it experienced severe street fighting. The Pont-√†-Mousson company was created in 1856 by a group of Lorraine businessmen to operate the Marbache iron mine and to use the ore to manufacture cast iron. Xavier Rog√© was the manager. In 1862 the enterprise was liquidated due to lack of sufficient capital to cover the high investment expenses. Rog√© managed to raise capital in the Saarland and restart the business, selling most of its production to forges in the Ardennes and Champagne. In 1866 Rog√© visited England and became aware of the new and promising market for cast-iron water pipes. He focused the company on pipe production, and found a ready market when cities began to make large investment in water supply after 1871. He adopted the English method of casting pipes in vertical rather than horizontal moulds. He was succeeded by Camille Cavallier, who transformed the moderately sized cast iron pipe manufacturer into a giant, always concentrating on making pipes. Annual cast iron production rose from 80,000 to 183,000 tons between 1900 and 1913. The company, later known as Saint-Gobain PAM is still producing ductile cast iron pipes and fittings for drinking water, irrigation and sewage applications. The plant of Pont-√†-Mousson, having its 160th anniversary in 2016, is the largest employer in the city, with an average 1000 employees spread among two plants, a research center and the headquarters of the company. 20th century Strategically positioned at an important river crossing, Pont-√†-Mousson and the surrounding region saw terrible fighting during the twentieth century wars between France and Germany. In the First World War Bois-Le-Pr√™tre, Croix des Carmes, Xon and Grand-Couronn√© are names that recall savage fighting between French and German soldiers. The town suffered further destruction in 1944, before being liberated by the U.S. Third Army under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, supported by an active local resistance movement. In 1921 the President personally presented the town with the Croix de guerre, and shortly after this D√©sir√© Ferry, the local deputy, was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur. After the Second World War Pont-√†-Mousson was again honoured, this time with the Croix de guerre (silver star).

Background and Early Life Mar√≠a was born in Ebebey√≠n, R√≠o Muni. Her family immigrated to Spain when she was a child where she studied literature. Born to ethnic Fang parents, she emigrated with her family to Spain when she was only eight years old. In narrating her own life, Maria Nsue often underscores the primal and formative impact of colonial interventions. She claims to have been born in jail, in 1948, in the city of Bata, where her parents had been confined for resisting the authority of the colonial regime. She belongs to the Fang ethnic group. She is the only child of Jos√© Nsue Angue Os√°-- an anticolonial and proindependence leader. She spent her early childhood in Bidjabidj√°n as a result of the arbitrary delineations of European colonial cartographers and policy makers. At the age of eight, Maria Nsue was entrusted to a Protestant missionary family temporarily assigned to the local mission. This is the family that later took her to Madrid. She spent her youth under the Francoist regime. She would eventually return to Equatorial Guinea in her twenties after the country's independence.  Education  Ang√ºe studied literature, music and journalism in Madrid. Writings Her 1985 novel, and most acclaimed work, Ekomo was the first novel written by an Equatoguinean woman to be published. It tells the story of a Fang woman and her husband. Ekomo is considered a work that changes the way one views the world. Equatorial Guinea which once belonged to Spain gained its independence in 1968 and then fell under a military dictatorship. La Guinea Espa√±ola is the beginning of Guinean literature where many works were published reflecting on the connections and the clash between Guinean, Spanish, and Latin American cultures. Ekomo is considered Hispano-African Literature which differs from Afro-Hispanic literature. Nnange is the main character of the novel writing after the death of her husband Ekomo. She tells of the struggles of attempting to find a cure for her husband's illness. She then begins reflecting on a woman's place in society and her current position as an outcast without a husband or children. Ekomo is the first novel written by a woman in Equatorial Guinea. Constant themes in her writing are the oppression of women and the consequences of colonization.  Works  Poetry, articles and poems Nsu√© Ang√ºe also wrote several short stories, articles and poems. Frequent topics addressed in her work involve women's rights and post-colonial African society. Much of her work is inspired by popular Fang literature. In addition to Ekomo, she is the author of a volume of short stories entitled Relatos (1999), largely based on traditional Fang stories of rural life, told as if from the perspective of a grandmother, but intertwined with an unrelenting criticism of the politico-economic situation in her country. Similarly rooted in tradition, but integrating percussion and live performance through the application of modern technologies, is the CD-ROM project Mbayah, o la leyenda del sauce llor√≥n (Mbayah, or the Legend of the Weeping Willow), released in 1997, for which she composed the narrative and music. * Ngouaba Nya, Jean Paul.

They are widely considered one of Spain's most prominent pop groups of the 1980s and early 1990s. The band consists of David Summers (bass, vocals), Rafael Gutierrez (guitar), Dani Mezquita (guitar), and Javi Molina (drums). Hombres G made their live debut at Madrid's Rock-Ola in 1983. Their sound was influenced by the early Beatles and the British new wave movement. They found commercial success with the release of Hombres G (1985) and the song \\"Devu√©lveme a mi chica\\". The youthful and adolescent nature of their music attracted a large audience, both at home and abroad ‚Äî thousands covered the Gran V√≠a Madrile√±a during the release of their two films and Lima's Jorge Ch√°vez International Airport was nearly closed due to the 20,000 fans that congregated on the landing runway during their first visit to Per√∫. The group's sound began to expand and show more adult concerns with the albums Voy a pas√°rmelo bien (1989) and √âsta es tu vida (1990). Hombres G went on hiatus after the release of their 1992 album, Historia del bikini. David pursued a solo career, Rafa and Dani remained involved in the music industry, and Javi devoted time to his bar in Madrid. The group reconvened in 2002 and released Peligrosamente Juntos, a collection of new material, demos, and hits. Hombres G also embarked on an international tour. In 2003, a variety of groups paid tribute to them ‚Äî Voy a pas√°rmelo bien, un tributo a Hombres G was released in Europe and ¬øQu√© te pasa? Est√°s borracho: Un tributo a Hombres G in the Americas. Todo esto es muy extra√±o (2004) was the first studio album released after the end of their hiatus. The following year they completed a sold-out tour with the Spanish pop rock band El Canto del Loco. Their next album, 10 (2007), received a nomination at the 2008 Latin Grammy Awards. Since then, they've released Desayuno continental (2010), En la playa (2011), 30 a√±os y un d√≠a (2015), y Resurrecci√≥n (2019). History Formation and the first singles (1982-1983) Dani Mezquita (left), Rafa Gutierrez (middle), and Javi Molina (right) perform on stage in 2009. Rafael Guti√©rrez Mu√±oz and David Summers Rodr√≠guez met in the hallways of Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola by mere coincidence in 1982; they were participants in the show Aplauso. Rafael's brother, Felipe, played bass in the rock band Tequila, but they'd recently dissolved. Rafa saw no definite role in the groups he had been part of: Pl√°stico (a group formed with Toti Arboles and Eduardo Benavente, who later became involved with Alaska y los Pegamoides), Las Chinas, and Los Zombies de Bernardo Bonezzi. David knew how to play clarinet, an instrument he studied due to his admiration for clarinetist Benny Goodman. Rafa asked David to play clarinet in the new group he was forming with his brother Felipe. However, David was already committed to forming a group with his two childhood friends, Daniel Mezquita Hardy and Francisco Javier de Molina Burgos. The three were classmates at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Informacion de Madrid. They'd been playing months prior under the names \\"Los Residuos\\" and \\"La Burgues√≠a Revolucionaria\\". A newspaper ad for the movie G Men, which Hombres G named themselves after. David welcomed Rafa's invitation to play music together, but instead asked him to play guitar with him, Dani, and Javi. Rafa accepted. They discarded their first idea of a name, \\"Bonitos Redford\\", and found inspiration in the 1935 James Cagney crime film G Men, which in Spain aired as \\"Contra el imperio del crimen\\". In the film, the G-Men were agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hombres G joined the independent recording company, Lollipop, who in 1983 released their first two singles: \\"Milagro en el Congo / Venezia\\" and \\"Marta tiene un marcapasos / La cagaste, Burt Lancaster\\". Assisting in the recording process were Fernando Cabello (sax) and two friends of the group, Eva Dalda and Lydia Iovanne. The group's early sound was reminiscent of La Movida Madrile√±a and shared similarities with Los Zombies, Los Ejecutivos Agresivos, Los Nikis, and Alaska y los Pegamoides. The rhythm and speed of the group's songs was also inspired by the sound of the American rock band, The Ramones. Live debut, a new recording contract, and the first album (1984) Hombres G made their live debut at Madrid's Rock-Ola in 1983. Lollipop encountered financial difficulties and was unable to support the band beginning in early 1984. Not long after, the group was interviewed by Radio Espa√±a with the purpose of promoting one of their performances. That is where they met Paco Mart√≠n, recent founder of the recording company, Twins. Ricardo Chirinos, vocalist of Pistones, had suggested the group to Mart√≠n. After listening to the interview and viewing the concert later that night, Mart√≠n was convinced that Hombres G was the group that he and fellow founder Pepe Escribano were looking for. He talked with the group after the show and the contract was set to be signed the next day. Recording on their debut album, Hombres G, commenced two weeks later at Trak studios under producer Paco Trinidad. Included in the album were a new version of \\"Venezia\\" and \\"Devu√©lveme a mi chica\\". The album featured two covers: \\"No llorar√©\\", based on \\"I Never Cry\\" by Alice Cooper, and \\"Sin Ti\\", a remake of the song \\"Reality\\" by Romanian composer, Vladimir Cosma. The album contained a very accessible pop sound, enjoyable lyrics, and youthful romanticism. The front cover is a still from the 1963 American science fiction comedy, The Nutty Professor. A few weeks later, it seemed Hombres G was not going to enjoy commercial success. Escribano became impatient and abandoned the company. Two weeks later, radio support and album sales increased. Six months later, the album reached 50,000 copies and a year later: 150,000. Sales eventually reached the millions. Popularity and promotion (1985) Hombres G experienced increasing popularity. Their first performance at the Gran Musical de la Cadena SER was scheduled for noon, as was the tradition. However, fans began to congregate at the front door beginning at 4 in the morning. The group made over 100 performances in 1985, in addition to television appearances and promotion in youth magazines. Many of their fans were female adolescents and the group found itself increasingly pressured, for they could no longer stroll through the streets of any Spanish city without hordes of girls following them. The second album and distribution throughout the Americas (1986) The group returned to Trak studios in February 1986 to begin recording their second album, La cagaste... Burt Lancaster (You Fucked Up... Burt Lancaster; named after one of their first songs). 60,000 copies of the album were ordered a month before its release. Hombres G salvaged one of the songs from the Lollipop era, \\"Marta tiene un marcapasos\\" ‚Äî the single went on to top sales charts in Spain. The album's sound has been described as less punk and more new wave than its predecessor. It made use of ska rhythms (\\"Visite Nuestro Bar\\") and was influenced by the slow sounds of the 1960s (\\"Te quiero\\" & \\"Un par de palabras\\"). The cover of the album featured an image of the American actor, Burt Lancaster, continuing Hombres G's string of references to American cinema. Their second album was even more successful than the first. The group began to receive proclamations of love, letters written in blood, and others in which the senders threatened suicide if they couldn't have a date with the group. One fan from Zaragoza sent more than 200 individually numbered letters. That summer, Hombres G went on tour, which included a performance at the Madrilenian bull arena Las Ventas, where the public began to congregate outside the venue beginning at 8 in the evening of the day before. With a consolidated market in Spain, Paco Mart√≠n placed his bet on taking the group to the Americas. He sent copies of their albums to companies across the American continent, receiving the first response from the Peruvian offices of CBS. Hombres G was edited in Peru in mid-1986, and in a few weeks, the album surpassed 50,000 copies. La cagaste‚Ä¶ Burt Lancaster was published later, but received a similar response. The next phone call was from the central offices of CBS in New York, to distribute Hombres G throughout all of America. Hombres G found success in M√©xico and Venezuela, where their albums obtained gold and platinum certification. Following the summer of 1986, sales of their first two albums reached nearly a million copies in Spain. In December 1986, the group was invited to attend the gala of the Bravo awards. The group was nominated in three categories and won \\"Mejor Agrupaci√≥n de Habla Hispana\\" (Best Spanish Speaking Group). Release of the first film and third album (1986-1987) Lead singer David Summers performing with Hombres G in 2007. David's father, Manuel Summers, was one of the most popular comedy film directors in Spain. The group received the offer to star in an autobiographic film. The result was Sufr√© mam√≥n, a movie filmed in Ibiza and Madrid, and which was set to premiere in March 1987. Once filming was finished, Hombres G began to work on their third album. The group didn't have much time to write new compositions, but the fast and tight lifestyle that they'd recently experienced served as inspiration. David isolated himself for a week at a cottage his family owned in Huelva, writing 12 compositions. For the next 15 days, the group finished work on the songs. A week later, Hombres G left for Manchester with Chilean producer Carlos Narea, and recorded Estamos locos... ¬øo qu√©? (Are We Crazy... Or What?). The album featured a variety of sounds, including songs based on very rapid rhythms (such as No, no‚Ä¶ no) and more traditional rock influences (such as Y cay√≥ la bomba (f√©tida) ). The themes of the lyrics concerned romance, intimacy, and masochistic tendencies. The release of the album coincided with the release of their first film. When the film premiered, it caused the collapse of the Gran Via Madrile√±a, where nearly 10,000 fans crowded the streets. When the group arrived, dozens of journalists and graphic reporters attempted to obtain snapshots. For security reasons, the four found themselves obligated to remain inside one room for several hours, and were unable to view the film until much later. Their assistants faced a similar scenario: even though they were able to gain entrance to the screening, they were unable to hear it due to the deafening murmur originating from the street and the constant singing of the fans watching the film. Tours in Spain and the American continent (1987) Endorsed by the fervor of their popularity, the group embarked on a tour of 60 performances across the bull rings and soccer stadiums of the most important Spanish cities. That summer, nearly one million people saw Hombres G live. In October, the group performed in America for the very first time, touring Per√∫, Ecuador, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, the United States, and M√©xico. When they arrived at Per√∫, the airplane windows revealed a crowd of more than 20,000 people spread across the landing runway of the Jorge Ch√°vez International Airport. The plane commander refused to open the doors until he knew what was happening. Banners welcoming Hombres G could be seen everywhere. The group was protected by four security guards at every hotel they lodged in, in order to prevent fans from seeping into their rooms ‚Äî though one fan managed to accomplish the feat. After visiting Per√∫ and Chil√©, Hombres G visited Ecuador. They performed twice for audiences of 40,000 at each show. Their stay in the Americas amounted to two months of intense promotional activity. A break, the second film, and the fourth album (1988) Hombres G enjoyed their first break in three years at the end of 1987. David took advantage of the tranquility of Christmas to compose new material. A new film project was launched under Manolo Summers in 1988. Filming began in March. Locations included Spain, Acapulco, and Puerto Vallarta. The movie was to be titled La cagaste Burt Lancaster but the actor Burt Lancaster threatened legal action; the name was changed to Su√©ltate el pelo. One of the film's actresses was Mexican singer Tatiana Palacios, and it is rumored that she and Guti√©rrez dated while the movie was being filmed. Hombres G recorded Agitar antes de usar (Shake Before Using) between February and March 1988. The music on the album fit the categories of pop rock, rock and roll, and ballad and spawned the commercially successful single, \\"Su√©ltate el pelo\\". Both the movie and album were released almost simultaneously, right before the summer season. Hombres G toured Spain and the American continent once again, placing special emphasis on M√©xico. At this time, sales of all their albums totaled more than 2 million copies in M√©xico. Sales in the smaller Spanish market were half of that figure, but Hombres G had already become the best selling band of the decade. In September 1988, the group performed at the \\"Concierto de Conciertos\\" in Bogot√°, Colombia. The show was a mega concert that spanned several days and featured a variety of artists. Among the performers were Miguel Mateos, Franco de Vita, Los Prisioneros, Timbiriche, Jos√© Feliciano, and Los Toreros Muertos. It was there that a radio announcer baptized Hombres G as the Latin Beatles. An evolving sound and a farewell (1989-1992) Voy a pas√°rmelo bien (I'm Going to Have A Good Time) was released in 1989. The group felt less pressured when composing songs for the album and their music showed a departure from the adolescent concerns of their previous works. Their image began to reflect a more adult world. The album continued the group's pop rock sound, but showed new influences. The song \\"Aprendiendo a caer\\", made use of bossa nova and \\"Madrid, Madrid\\" has been compared to Frank Sinatra's music. The group toured both sides of the Atlantic with a new perspective. Hombres G recorded √âsta es tu vida (This Is Your Life) in the summer of 1990 in Madrid and London. Their sixth studio album contained more profound lyrics and a more sophisticated sound; it featured music performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. During this period Summers and Mezquita composed several songs for artist Luz Casal, including the ballad Te Dej√© Marchar. That same year, Dani Mezquita married Elena Portables. On January 18, 1992, Summers married his longtime girlfriend, Marta Madruga. Hombres G bid farewell on May 20, 1992, with their seventh album, Historia del bikini (History of the Bikini). Production was completed by Colin Fairley, whose experience included working with artists Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe. Hiatus (1992-2002) Following the release of their seventh album were various recopilatory records such as Los singles 1984-1993 and Las Baladas, but they never offered new material. Over the following years, all members of the group remained involved in music. Summers pursued a solo career, touring Spain and the Americas and releasing four albums. Manuel Summers died before the release of David Summers; as a result, the album was dedicated to him. Rafa performed with other musicians and participated in the first album by Ella Baila Sola. He also formed a group called \\"Rafa & Co.\\" who released a self-titled album in 1996. Dani became a marketing director for the record company DRO East West. Javier cared for his Pop'n'Roll bar in Madrid, playing drums now and then for the groups he invited to perform. Career comeback and tributes (2002-2004) After their extended break, Hombres G returned with new material. In 2002 they released Peligrosamente Juntos (Dangerously together), an album that included hits, demos, and five new songs. The version released in America contained the new songs Lo noto and En otro mundo. The European version contained the mentioned songs and also contained Intimidad, No te escaparas and Te vi. At the end of 2003, Spanish pop groups such as El Canto del Loco, Los Piston, Antonio Vega, Los Secretos, Mikel Erentxun, Seguridad Social, √Ålex Ubago and La Cabra Mec√°nica, united to make a tribute album to Hombres G. The album Voy a pas√°rmelo bien, un tributo a Hombres G (I'm going to have a good time, a tribute to Hombres G), contained cover versions of classic Hombres G singles. Another tribute was made in America with groups such as Divisi√≥n Min√∫scula, Moderatto and La Quinta Estaci√≥n. In 2004, their first two films were released in DVD format in a pack called Hombres G - Las pel√≠culas (Hombres G - The Movies), also including extras. That same year, Hombres G released El a√±o que vivimos peligrosamente (The year that we lived dangerously). It included live versions of songs from their Peligrosamente Juntos tour. Todo esto es muy extra√±o and tour (2004-2007) For the first time in over twelve years, Hombres G released a new studio album entitled Todo esto es muy extra√±o (This is all very strange) in 2004. The album was produced by Nigel Walker and contained 11 new songs. The release marked the return of Hombres G to the music scene. The first single off the album was ¬øPor qu√© no ser amigos? which featured the frontman from the Spanish pop/rock band El canto del loco. No lo s√© and ¬øQu√© soy yo para t√≠? were the other singles released off the album. Hombres G embarked on numerous tours throughout Spain, Latin America, and the United States in support of this album. The album had minimal diffusion in the Americas.http://www.netjoven.pe/musica/mp3/1032/Hombres-G_Marta-tiene-un- marcapasos.html#biografia 10 and tour (2007-2009) On September 18, 2007, Hombres G released their tenth album 10, which contained 11 new songs. The album spawned two singles: Me Siento Bien and Hombre Real. 10 is described as tuning into the \\"raw energy of early rock\\" and hinting at Euro-rock and at the \\"atmospheric aesthetic favored by Coldplay and the legendary U2\\" by AllMusic.

Career Gubbins was appointed a student interpreter in the British Japan Consular Service in 1871. He was English Secretary to the Conference at Tokyo for the Revision of the Treaties, after Ernest Satow left Japan in 1883. On 1 June 1889, he was appointed Japanese Secretary at Tokyo. He was employed in London at the Foreign Office from February to July 1894 in the Aoki-Kimberley negotiations which resulted in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation (16 July 1894). He was appointed CMG in the 1898 Birthday Honours. He was, especially in retirement, a close friend of Satow's. He was elected the first President of the newly founded Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch in 1900. Despite having no university degree, Gubbins was awarded an honorary master's degree from Balliol College and was made Lecturer in Japanese language at Oxford University (1909‚Äì12). Lack of pupils led to his position being terminated. Family Gubbins frequently visited Colin Alexander McVean's residence at Yamato Yashiki, Tokyo around 1870s, and met his daughter Helen. After McVean returned to Scotland and settled down at the Isle of Mull, Gubbins visited McVean family and met Helen again. 41 years Gubbins and 24 years Helen fell in love and married in 1894, then lived in Japan.

It was held by the House of Montb√©liard from the 11th century. Part of the county, the so-called Barrois mouvant, became a fief of the Kingdom of France in 1301 and was elevated to a duchy in 1354. The Barrois non-mouvant remained a part of the Empire. From 1480, it was united to the imperial Duchy of Lorraine. Both imperial Bar and Lorraine came under the influence of France in 1735, with Bar ceded to the deposed king of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. According to the Treaty of Vienna (1738), the duchy would pass to the French crown upon Stanis≈Çaw's death, which occurred in 1766. County (1033‚Äì1354) The county of Bar originated in the frontier fortress of Bar (from Latin barra, barrier) that Duke Frederick I of Upper Lorraine built on the bank of the river Ornain around 960. The fortress was originally directed at the counts of Champagne, who had made incursions into Frederick's allodial lands. Frederick also confiscated some lands from the nearby Abbey of Saint-Mihiel and settled his knights on it. The original Barrois was thus a mixture of the duke's allodial lands and confiscated church lands enfeoffed to knights. On the death of Duke Frederick III in 1033, these lands passed to his sister, Sophia (died 1093), who was the first person to associate the comital title with Bar, styling herself \\"Countess of Bar\\". Sophia's descendants, of the House of Montb√©liard, expanded Bar \\"by usurpation, conquest, purchase, and marriage\\" into a de facto autonomous state perched between France and Germany. Its population was francophone and culturally French, and the counts were involved in French politics. Count Reginald II (died 1170) married Agnes, a sister of the queen of France, Adele. His son, Henry I, died on the Third Crusade in 1190. From 1214 to 1291 Bar was ruled by Henry II and Theobald II, who secured the western frontier with Champagne by granting fiefs to French nobles and buying their homage. In 1297 King Philip IV of France invaded the Barrois because Count Henry III had given aid to his father-in-law, Edward I of England, when the latter intervened against France in the Franco-Flemish War. In the Treaty of Bruges of 1301 Henry was forced to recognise all of his county west of the river Meuse as a fief of France. This was the origin of the Barrois mouvant: a territory that was turned into a fief was said to have \\"moved\\" and entered the mouvance of its suzerain. It was subject to the Parliament of Paris. The Treaty of Bruges did not represent any expansion of French territory. The territory to the west of the Meuse was French since the Treaty of Verdun of 843, but in 1301 it became a direct fief of the crown, including its allodial parts. The former ducal palace at Bar-le-Duc is today a museum, the Mus√©e Barrois. Medieval duchy (1354‚Äì1508) In 1354 the Count of Bar took the ducal title and was thereafter recognised as a Peer of France. P√®re Anselme (died 1694) believed that Count Robert had been created a duke by King John II of France in preparation for the count's marriage to John's daughter, Mary. The rulers of Bar were not created dukes by imperial appointment. The only title Count Robert received by imperial grant in 1354 was that of Margrave of Pont-√†-Mousson. This margraviate was frequently bestowed by the Dukes of Bar on their heirs apparent. In that same year the emperor raised the County of Luxembourg into a duchy and Bar fell between two duchies, Luxembourg and Upper Lorraine. The ducal title was eventually accepted by the emperors, however, and the imperial tax register of 1532 records the \\"Duchy on the Meuse\\" (Herzogtum von der Ma√ü) as a voting member of the Reichstag. In 1430 the last duke of the male line of the ruling house, Louis, died. Bar passed to his great-nephew, Ren√© I, who was married to Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. In 1431 the couple inherited Lorraine. On Ren√©'s death in 1480, Bar passed to his daughter Yolanda and her son, Ren√© II, who was already Duke of Lorraine. In 1482 he conquered the pr√©v√¥t√© of Virton, a part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, and annexed it to Bar. In 1484 Peter II, Duke of Bourbon, regent for King Charles VIII of France, formally installed him in the Duchy of Bar. In his final testament published in 1506, Ren√© decreed that the two duchies of Bar and Lorraine should never be separated. The two duchies remained joined in personal union permanently. Modern duchy (1508‚Äì1766) On 2 October 1735 the preliminary Treaty of Vienna between France and the Empire ending the War of the Polish Succession granted Bar and Lorraine to the deposed king of Poland, Stanislaus Leszczynski. It was agreed that he should receive Bar immediately, but for Lorraine he had to wait until the death of Grand Duke Gian Gastone of Tuscany (which took place on 9 July 1737), so that the deposed duke of Lorraine could inherit Tuscany. In January 1736, Stanislaus formally renounced his claim to the Polish throne (although he was allowed to retain the royal title). In August, France and the Empire finalized their agreement concerning the exchange of territories. The emperor renounced his suzerainty over Bar and Lorraine.Rudolf Vierhaus, Germany in the Age of Absolutism (Cambridge University Press), p. 133. On 30 September 1736, Stanislaus signed a convention, known as the Declaration of Meudon, whereby the French king would appoint the governor of Lorraine. On 8 February 1737, Stanislaus took possession of Bar and on 21 March of Lorraine.Charles T. Lipp, Noble Strategies in an Early Modern Small State: The Mahuet of Lorraine (University of Rochester Press), pp. 135‚Äì36. On 18 November 1738, the final Treaty of Vienna was signed. Stanislaus turned over the incomes from Bar and Lorraine to the French crown in exchange for a generous pension, which he used to fund construction projects in the duchies. On his death on 23 February 1766 the duchies passed to the royal domain of France as per the treaty. List of rulers All the dates are regnal dates.

Biographical sketch  Family relations  Born in about 1066 in Dijon, Duchy of Burgundy, Count Henry was the youngest son of Henry, the second son of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. His two older brothers, Hugh I and Odo, inherited the duchy. No contemporary record of his mother has survived. She was once thought to have been named Sibylla based on an undated obituary reporting the death of \\"Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\\" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy), under the reasoning that she was not called duchess herself and hence must have been the wife of Henry, the only father of a duke who never himself held the ducal title, yet this was probably a reference to her daughter-in-law, Sibylla, mother of the then-reigning Hugh II. Richard suggested that she might instead have been called Cl√©mence. Whatever her name, her son Henry was kinsman (congermanus) of his brother-in-law, Raymond of Burgundy, and this relationship may have come through either, or both, of their mothers, who are both of undocumented parentage. It has been suggested that Henry's mother may have been the daughter of Reginald I, which would make her the maternal aunt of Raymond who would then be Henry‚Äôs first cousin. This solution is problematic, as Henry's brother Odo I, Duke of Burgundy married Raymond's sister, Sibylla, and though marriages between close kin sometimes took place through dispensation, the prohibition against first-cousin marriages in church law makes it likely that the relationship between Odo and Sibylla, and hence that between Henry and Raymond, was more distant. Based on the relationship between Henry and Raymond and the apparent introduction of the byname Borel into the family of the dukes of Burgundy through this marriage, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay suggested Henry's mother was daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona, and his wife Guisla de Llu√ß√†. One of his paternal aunts was Constance of Burgundy, the wife of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n, and one of his grand-uncles was Hugh, Abbot of Cluny, one of the most influential and venerated personalities of his time. Count Henry‚Äôs family was very powerful and governed many cities in France such as Chalon, Auxerre, Autun, Nevers, Dijon, M√¢con and Semur.  Reconquista  After the defeat of the Christian troops in the Battle of Sagrajas in October 1086, in the early months of the following year, King Alfonso VI appealed for aid from Christians at the other side of the Pyrenees. Many French nobles and soldiers heeded the call, including Raymond of Burgundy, Henry's brother, Duke Odo, and Raymond of St. Gilles, Not all of them arrived at the same time in the Iberian Peninsula and it is most likely that Raymond of Burgundy came in 1091. Although some authors claim that Count Henry came with the expedition which arrived in 1087, even though \\"documentary evidence here is much more slight\\", his presence is confirmed only as of 1096 when he appears confirming the forais of Guimar√£es and Constantim de Panoias. Three of these French nobles married daughters of King Alfonso VI: Raymond of Burgundy married infanta Urraca, later Queen Urraca of Le√≥n; Raymond of St. Gilles married Elvira; and Henry of Burgundy married Teresa of Le√≥n, an illegitimate daughter of the king and his mistress Jimena Mu√±oz. Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile appoints Henry to the County of Portugal, in 1096.  Pact with his cousin Raymond of Burgundy  Between the first quarter of 1096 and the end of 1097, count Raymond, seeing that his influence in the Curia Regis was diminishing, reached an agreement with his cousin Henry of Burgundy, who had not yet been appointed governor of Portugal. The birth of King Alfonso's only son, Sancho Alf√≥nsez, was also perceived as a threat by the two cousins. They agreed to share power, the royal treasury, and to support each other. Under this agreement, which counted with the blessings of their relative, the Abbot of Cluny, Raymond \\"promised his cousin under oath to hand him over the Kingdom of Toledo and one‚Äìthird of the royal treasury upon the death of King Alfonso VI\\". If he could not deliver Toledo, he would give him Galicia. Henry, in turn, promised to help Raymond \\"obtain all the dominions of King Alfonso and two‚Äìthirds of the royal treasury\\". It seems that news of this pact reached the king who, in order to counter the initiative of his two sons-in-law, appointed Henry governor of the region extending a flumine mineo usque in tagum (from the Minho River to the banks of the Tagus). Until then, this region had been governed by count Raymond who saw his power limited to just Galicia.  After the death of Alfonso VI  View of the South side of Braga Cathedral where Henry, Count of Portugal was buried After Raymond's death, Queen Urraca (Teresa's half-sister) married Alfonso the Battler for political and strategic reasons. Henry took advantage of the family conflicts and political unrest to serve on both sides and aggrandize his domains at the cost of the squabbling royal couple. Caught under siege in Astorga by the King of Aragon, then at war with Urraca, Henry held the city with the help of his sister-in-law. Henry died on 22 May 1112, from wounds received during the siege. His remains were transferred, following his previous orders, to Braga where he was buried in a chapel at Braga Cathedral the building of which he had promoted. After his death, his widow governed the county since their son Afonso was only three years old at that time.  Legacy  Count Henry was the leader of a group of gentlemen, monks, and clerics of French origin who exerted great influence in the Iberian Peninsula, promoted many reforms and introduced several institutions from the other side of the Pyrenees, such as the customs of Cluny and the Roman Rite. They occupied relevant ecclesiastical and political positions which provoked a strong backlash during the last years of the reign of King Alfonso VI.  Marriage and issue  He married Teresa of Le√≥n around 1095. From Teresa, Henry had two sons and three daughters of whom three survived to adulthood: *Urraca Henriques (after 1169), the wife of Bermudo P√©rez de Traba, tenente in Trast√°mara, Viseu, Seia, and Faro in A Coru√±a. *Sancha Henriques (1163), married the nobleman Sancho Nunes de Celanova. On 15 July 1129, the abbess of the Monastery of San Salvador de Ferreira de Pant√≥n purchased from Mendo N√∫√±ez, his brother Sancho, and the wife of the latter, Sancha Henriques, some properties in Estriz. One of their daughters, Mar√≠a, was the abbess at the Monastery of San Salvador de Sobrado de Trives. They were also the parents of count Velasco, Gil, Fernando, and Teresa S√°nchez. After becoming a widow, she married Fernando M√©ndez de Braganza, with no issue from this second marriage. *Afonso Henriques (11091185). He was named after his maternal grandfather, King Alfonso VI, perhaps \\"as a way of remembering that the blood of the Emperor of all Hispania also ran through his veins\\". Afonso became Count of Portugal in 1112 and King of Portugal in 1139.

Live music on the site of the O Academy Birmingham's former Dale End venue dates back to 1964 when the venue was first opened as the Top Rank Ballroom. By the 1980s and 1990s the same venue was known as the Hummingbird. In the late 1990s, the venue underwent refurbishment and, in 2000, reopened as the '. In 2002, it was then rebranded as the '. On 6 November 2008, it was announced that O had purchased naming rights for all Live Nation's AMG venues, in a ¬£ sponsorship deal, lasting until 2013. As a result, in line with O's branding, the venue became the O Academy Birmingham. In September 2009, the O Academy moved to the site of the former Dome II Nightclub located on Horsefair, Bristol Street. The decision to move to a brand new venue was decided twofold. The former venue was unsuitable for the needs of a modern music venue and the building complex it resided in, along with the Oasis Centre above, was scheduled for demolition as part of a project called Martineau Galleries. The Used played the last ever Academy listed show at the old Dale End Academy location. However, due to the credit crunch and reduced investment in buy-to-let projects, the Martineau project was put on hold and the location continued as a music venue under the name ' from 2011 until January 2013 when the venue closed its doors for the final time. New venue (2009‚Äìpresent) At the new venue in Bristol Street, local band Editors headlined the opening night followed by further gigs the following nights by The Twang, The Streets and Ocean Colour Scene. For these gigs, commemorative wristbands were given out as part of a marketing campaign by members of the marketing team known as O angels. Like the former Academy venue, the new venue has a multi-room operation with the main room having a capacity of 3,009 (of which there is a dedicated 600 capacity seated area) and two other rooms, the O Academy 2 with 600 and O Academy 3 with 250. However, in an improvement to the Dale End site, the new venue was designed to allow all three venues to be in use at the same time. A dedicated queuing system and box office is also in operation for each room. Therefore, the venue has a full capacity of 3,859. To coincide with the launch of the Bristol Street venue, the club night Propaganda moved from the Gatecrasher venue in Birmingham to the Academy on Friday 18 September 2009. This is now a club night spread over all three academy rooms, playing a variety of indie/pop music.

He became one of the six original commodores of the permanent United States Navy, and commanded a blockade of Tripoli in 1801 during the First Barbary War of Thomas Jefferson's presidency. Early years Richard Dale was born in Portsmouth parish, Norfolk County, Virginia, the eldest son of Winfield Dale, shipwright and merchant, and Ann Sutherland. His father died when Dale was ten years old. Two years later, Dale signed on with a merchant vessel owned by an uncle that took him to Liverpool, England. Upon his return to Virginia, Dale became apprenticed to a ship-owner, through whom he made several journeys to the West Indies. Within five years, he achieved the rank of chief mate on a valuable brig. He remained in the merchant service until the spring of 1776.Simpson, 1859 pp.278‚Äì279Sears, 1855 p.267 Revolutionary War Dale's record during the Revolutionary War proved eclectic. After departing the merchant service in 1776 he signed on as a lieutenant in the navy of the colony of Virginia. His tenure proved brief, since he was captured shortly thereafter by a tender of the frigate .Simpson, 1859 p.279 He knew many of the men in the ship's crew from his time as a merchant, and they persuaded Dale to sign up for the British cause. He served for Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia. While fighting for the British, Dale received his first battle wounds when he was caught in a confrontation with American pilot boats. During his convalescence in Norfolk, Virginia, he determined that he would return to the patriot cause at his first opportunity. En route to Jamaica, the British vessel upon which Dale traveled was captured by the American Captain John Barry on his ship . Dale volunteered to serve on the American ship, and entered their service with the rank of Midshipman.Simpson, 1859 pp.279‚Äì280 He continued on with Lexington after Barry was replaced as captain by William Hallock, who promoted Dale to Master's Mate. Unfortunately for Dale, the ship was captured by the British frigate . Select officers from Lexington were taken onto Pearl as prisoners, Dale included, although a sudden gale permitted the rest of the America crew to escape. In January 1777, Dale was released in a prisoner exchange and returned to Lexington, now under yet another captain, Henry Johnston. Lexington joined a squadron that caused some destruction on the coast of Ireland, which compelled the British to chase and, eventually, capture the brig and its crew. They were taken to Plymouth, England and the crew imprisoned in Mill Prison in September 1777. Mill Prison Charged with high treason against the crown, Johnston, Dale and the rest of the crew were treated harshly in the prison. A lack of sufficient food compelled them at one point to kill and eat a dog for survival. Their conditions improved only after sympathetic British civilians collected enough money to supply them with the bare necessities for sustenance. Still, the American sailors were unprepared to wait out the remainder of the war in prison, and dug a tunnel under the wall through which they attempted to make their escape. Dale and a colleague were re-captured as they attempted to board a ship from London to Dunkirk, and were returned to Mill Prison. As punishment for their escape attempt, they were both subjected to forty days of solitude in the \\"Black Hole.\\" While in prison, Dale obtained a journal wherein he used his time constructively. He continued the education he had not completed in his youth. He taught himself the multiplication table, different weights and measures, multiplication and division, as well as fractions. He also examined the rules of barter, stocks and interest, and created a glossary of different naval commands necessary to captain a ship. After a captivity at Mill Prison that lasted over a year, Dale finally managed to successfully escape in February, 1779. He walked out of the prison gates without creating suspicion, wearing the uniform of a British officer. He never recorded how he had obtained the uniform. He also obtained the necessary papers in London to leave England and make his escape to L'Orient, France. Bonhomme Richard In L'Orient, Dale signed on as Master's Mate with John Paul Jones on , which was a French East Indiaman that had been converted to a warship. He received a promotion to First Lieutenant in short order. The ship cruised along the west coast of Ireland and brought the war into British waters. Through the capture or destruction of many vessels, he contributed to the disruption of British trade, and made many residents impatient for the war to end. On September 23, 1779, Bonhomme Richard met HMS Serapis off the coast of Flamborough Head, near Yorkshire. Described as being somewhat reckless in his bravery, Dale commanded the forward guns in the close fighting of the battle. When rumors that Bonhomme Richard was sinking reached him from below decks, and that the crew was prepared to surrender, Dale went to ascertain the damage. Upon his assessment that the ship would not yet sink, he inspired the crew to persist in the fight. He compelled his British prisoners to man the pumps to keep the ship afloat while the battle continued above. After Captain Richard Pearson of Serapis struck his flag and declared the battle an American victory, Dale, as second in command of Bonhomme Richard, was the first American to board the British vessel. He then arranged for Pearson to meet with Jones to arrange the surrender of Serapis. Once his duties had been fulfilled, Dale realized that he had been wounded in the melee. A large splinter had resulted in a serious injury to Dale's foot and ankle. The pain from the wound caused him to collapse and faint. When the damage done to Bonhomme Richard proved irreparable, the Americans boarded HMS Serapis and departed the scene. Although he required some time to convalesce, Dale remained as Jones' first lieutenant for two more years, first on , then on USS . When Ariel arrived at the port of Philadelphia on the 14th of April, 1781, it was the first time Dale stepped foot on American soil in four years. The rank of first lieutenant that Jones bestowed upon Dale was, to this point, recognized only by the French government that had financed Jones' privateer ventures. In recognition for his services, the American Continental Congress now officially recognized his rank as well, and made him a first lieutenant in the Continental Navy. Continental Navy When Congress appointed John Paul Jones as commander of the not-yet-built 74-gun ship-of-the line , Jones asked Dale to remain in his service. Dale declined Jones' offer, concerned that he would be kept away from sea too long during construction of the ship. His decision proved astute, since Congress ultimately gave the ship to the French government in payment of a debt, rather than to Jones to captain. Instead, Dale signed on as lieutenant for Captain Nicholson of , for the Continental Navy. Almost immediately after its departure from Philadelphia, Trumbull was confronted by a British frigate during a severe storm. Dale was wounded, then captured in the ensuing fight and taken to New York City. New York had been occupied by British forces since 1776, and Dale was again a prisoner of war. This time, his imprisonment was comparatively short. Continental agents negotiated an early release for Dale. Within two months' time, he was free again. He signed on as the first officer on the American privateer , a large merchant ship for which the Continental Congress approved a letter of marque. This gave Queen of France the authority to attack British vessels in the name of the Continental Navy. When Dale received command of the ship, he was able to use it to advantage and captured a number of the enemy's vessels. Dale returned to Philadelphia in February 1783. When the war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in September of that year, the Continental Navy was officially disbanded. Along with all the other Continental officers, Dale's commission ended and he became a civilian for the first time in eight years. In 1783, Dale became an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati. Merchant and family Dale got involved in the China Trade after the war, both as an investor and as a seaman. He became a successful captain and merchant during his commercial ventures between the United States and seaports in the Far East, in both China and India. When he was stateside, he often found himself in Philadelphia, the capital of the new country during the years 1790 through 1800. He used this time to visit his former commander and lifelong friend, John Barry. On one visit, Dale met the cousin of Barry's wife Sarah, Dorethea Crathorne. Richard and Dorethea were married on September 15, 1791, at Christ Church in Philadelphia. Their first child was born the next year, while they lived at their first home together at 49 Pine Street. Seven more children were to follow. During their lives together in Philadelphia, the Dales also lived at 69 Pine, 271 Chestnut, 69 Spruce, and 296 Walnut Streets. The first ten years of their marriage often found Dale at sea as the captain of different vessels, either commanding merchant ships or in the newly established United States Navy.  United States Navy  Portrait of Richard Dale by Jacob Eichholtz In 1794, President George Washington established the United States Navy through order of Congress, ostensibly to protect American merchant vessels from the threat of privateers from the Barbary Nations, who took advantage of the new country's lack of a strong military presence in the Mediterranean Sea. Secretary of War Henry Knox selected six men, the elite of the country's naval command, to become the first commanders in the new branch of the American military. Richard Dale was selected as one of those six. Dale accepted the appointment and traveled to Norfolk, Virginia, for his first assignment: to supervise construction on the frigate . Due to the signing of a peace treaty with Algiers, one of the Barbary nations, which created some stability in the Mediterranean, construction on the frigate was halted. Dale requested and received a temporary furlough from the Navy and resumed business in the China trade. He was called back into the Navy in 1796 because of tensions that had developed between the United States and France, in what was known as the Quasi-War. As captain of the modified merchant ship , which was hastily equipped for military service, Dale gained the distinction of being the first man to command a ship at sea on behalf of the United States Navy. Ganges was used to protect the American coastline during the conflict and did not see any fighting. A conflict of another kind caused Dale to request a second furlough after hostilities with France were redressed. Dale and some of the other five naval leaders became engaged in a dispute over their proper ranks. While government officials considered their concerns, Dale resumed the Far East trade. Upon his return to Philadelphia, the issue had been settled to his satisfaction, and Dale accepted his orders. He was to command a small fleet assigned to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean Sea. American ships were no longer safe against the privateers of the North African nation- states.  Barbary War  During the First Barbary War with North Africa Commodore Dale sailed in the flagship with Captain James Barron and a fleet of four other ships.Cooper, 1846 p.35 In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson assigned them to blockade the city of Tripoli, where government-sanctioned pirates seized European and American merchant ships and enslaved their crews. The United States government reluctantly paid tribute to the leaders of Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers for a number of years to ensure the protection of American interests. Regardless, the Barbary pirates continued to sporadically seize American property and sailors. During the years 1801 and 1802, while Dale and his fleet regulated these waters, American ships remained unthreatened. Dale maintained the blockade until a lack of provisions and rampant illness among the crews of his ships compelled him to return to his base in Virginia. Dale received new orders to return to the Mediterranean after his return to the States; however, he was dissatisfied with the conditions of his assignment. He resigned his commission in the United States Navy when he discovered that there would be no captain on his flagship. He considered it a dishonor for him to assume the responsibilities of a captain while serving as a commodore. Instead. he returned to Philadelphia as a civilian, and lived the remainder of his life on land, with his wife and family.  Retirement and death  Dale had done well for himself as a merchant seaman. Upon his return to Philadelphia, he changed the focus of his career and became a director of the Insurance Company of North America. Six months later, he shifted allegiance to the Union Insurance Company, and remained there as one of its directors for over twenty years. He served as its president from September 1824 to July 1825. Back in 1785, George Washington signed a certificate that admitted Dale into the Society of the Cincinnati, which honored officer veterans of the Revolutionary War. Dale remained an active member for the rest of his life, and became involved in the effort to construct a monument dedicated to George Washington in Philadelphia, which ultimately never materialized. He was also active in the Society for the Relief of Poor and Distressed Masters of Ships, Their Wives and Children (est. 1765), and served in the Washington Benevolent Society of Pennsylvania. During the War of 1812, he was a member of the General Committee, formed to protect Philadelphia from potential attack by the British military. A Protestant Episcopalian, he devoted himself to the religious affairs of the church in Philadelphia. In 1816, he served as president of the Marine Bible Association of the City of Philadelphia, founded by the Philadelphia Bible Society with the intention to further the spiritual welfare of American merchant seamen. He was a co-founder of the Mariner's Church, a non-denominational church located right off the docks of the city port to cater to traveling seamen. Designed by William Strickland, it was one of the largest churches in the city at the time. He also served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Diocese, a Trustee of the Episcopate Fund, and participated in various conventions dedicated to the perpetuation of the Episcopalian message. He closely followed the construction and affairs of the St. Stephens Church in Philadelphia during its construction and until his death. Dale was sixty-nine when he died in Philadelphia. Originally laid to rest in the Christ Church Burial Ground, and followed by Dorethea with her death four years later, they were both reinterred in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in 1888.

The war resulted in the Afghans winning back control of foreign affairs from Britain, and the British recognizing Afghanistan as an independent nation. According to British author Michael Barthorp, it was also a strategic victory for the British because the Durand Line was reaffirmed as the border between Afghanistan and the British Raj, and the Afghans agreed not to foment trouble on the British side. However, Afghans who were on the British side of the border did cause concerns due to revolts. Background The root cause of the Third Anglo-Afghan War lies long before fighting commenced. For the British in India, Afghanistan was seen as a threat. The British worried about Russian intentions, concerned that an invasion of India could be launched by Tsarist forces through Afghanistan. This period became known as the Great Game. In an effort to negate this threat, the British made numerous attempts at imposing their will upon Kabul, and over the course of the 19th Century fought two wars: the First Anglo- Afghan War (1839‚Äì42) and the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878‚Äì80). The end of the Second Afghan War in 1880 marked the beginning of almost 40 years of good relations between Britain and Afghanistan under the leadership of Abdur Rahman Khan and Habibullah Khan, during which time the British attempted to manage Afghan foreign policy through the payment of a large subsidy. While ostensibly the country remained independent, under the Treaty of Gandumak (1879) it accepted that in external matters it would \\"...have no windows looking on the outside world, except towards India\\". The death in 1901 of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan led indirectly to the war that began 18 years later. His successor, Habibullah, was a pragmatic leader who sided with Britain or Russia, depending on Afghan interests. Despite considerable resentment over not being consulted over the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 (Convention of St. Petersburg), Afghanistan remained neutral during the First World War (1914‚Äì18), resisting considerable pressure from the Ottoman Empire when it entered the conflict on the side of Imperial Germany and the Sultan (as titular leader of Islam) called for a holy war against the Allies. Despite remaining neutral in the conflict, Habibullah did in fact accept a Turkish-German mission in Kabul and military assistance from the Central Powers as he attempted to play both sides of the conflict for the best deal. Through continual prevarication, he resisted numerous requests for assistance from the Central Powers, but failed to keep in check troublesome tribal leaders, intent on undermining British rule in India, as Turkish agents attempted to foment trouble along the frontier. The departure of a large part of the British Indian Army to fight overseas and news of British defeats at the hands of the Turks aided Turkish agents in efforts at sedition, and in 1915 there was unrest amongst the Mohmands and then the Mahsuds. Not withstanding these outbreaks, the frontier generally remained settled at a time when Britain could ill afford trouble. A Turco-German mission left Kabul in 1916. By that time, however, it had successfully convinced Habibullah that Afghanistan was an independent nation and that it should be beholden to no one. With the end of the First World War, Habibullah sought to obtain reward from the British government for his assistance during the war. Looking for British recognition of Afghanistan's independence in foreign affairs, he demanded a seat at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919. This request was denied by the Viceroy, Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, on the grounds that attendance at the conference was confined to the belligerents. Further negotiations were scheduled, but before they could begin Habibullah was assassinated on 19 February 1919. This resulted in a power struggle as Habibullah's brother Nasrullah Khan proclaimed himself as Habibullah's successor, while in Kabul Amanullah, Habibullah's third son, had also proclaimed himself Amir. The Afghan army suspected Amanullah's complicity in the death of his father. Needing a way of cementing his power, upon seizing the throne in April 1919 Amanullah posed as a man of democratic ideals, promising reforms in the system of government. He stated that there should be no forced labour, tyranny or oppression, and that Afghanistan should be free and independent and no longer bound by the Treaty of Gandamak. Amanullah had his uncle Nasrullah arrested for Habibullah's murder and had him sentenced to life imprisonment. Nasrullah had been the leader of a more conservative element in Afghanistan and his treatment rendered Amanullah's position as Amir somewhat tenuous. By April 1919 he realised that if he could not find a way to placate the conservatives, he would be unlikely to maintain his hold on power. Looking for a diversion from the internal strife in the Afghan court and sensing advantage in the rising civil unrest in India following the Amritsar massacre,Following a similar trend to what was happening in Afghanistan, there had been a rising nationalist movement in India at the same time, culminating in riots and disorder in Punjab. On 13 April 1919, Dyer learnt that a large political meeting was taking place at the Jallianwala Bagh, an enclosed area in Amritsar. Fearing that the agitators would incite the crowd to violence and murder and that he had a very small force to protect the European community, Dyer marched 50 men into the Bagh and subsequently opened fire, killing 379 and wounding a further 1,500. Amanullah decided to invade British India. Opposing forces In 1919 the Afghan regular army was not a very formidable force, and was only able to muster some 50,000 men. These men were organised into 21 cavalry regiments and 75 infantry battalions, with about 280 modern artillery pieces, organised into 70 batteries, in support. In addition to this, however, in a boost to the army's strength, the Afghan command could call upon the loyalty of up to 80,000 frontier tribesmen and an indeterminate number of deserters from local militia units under British command. In reality, the Afghan regular army was not ready for war. As in past years, the upper levels of the officer corps were riddled with political intrigue. In his book on the campaign, Lieutenant-General George Molesworth gave the following evaluation of the Amir's army: > Afghan regular units...were ill-trained, ill-paid, and probably under > strength. The cavalry was little better than indifferent infantry mounted on > equally indifferent ponies. Rifles varied between modern German, Turkish and > British types, to obsolete Martinis and Snyders. Few infantry units had > bayonets. Artillery was ponydrawn, or pack, and included modern 10cm Krupp > howitzers, 75mm Krupp mountain guns and ancient 7 pounder weapons. There > were a few, very old, four-barrel Gardiner machine guns. Ammunition was in > short supply and distribution must have been very difficult. For the > artillery much black powder was used, both as a propellent and bursting > charge for shells. The Kabul arsenal workshops were elementary and mainly > staffed by Sikh artificers with much ingenuity but little real skill. There > was no organised transport and arrangements for supply were rudimentary. In support of the regulars, the Afghan command expected to call out the tribes, which could gather up to 20,000 or 30,000 Afridi fighters in the Khyber region alone. In stark contrast to the regulars, the tribal lashkars were probably the best troops that the Afghans had, being of excellent fighting quality, well armed, mainly with weapons that they had made themselves or stolen from the garrisons and with plenty of ammunition. In meeting this threat, the British could call on a much larger force. In May 1919, the British and British Indian Army, not including frontier militia, totalled eight divisions, as well as five independent brigades of infantry and three of cavalry. However, of this force the entire North-West Frontier Province had three infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades, although there was also GHQ India's central reserve of one infantry division and one cavalry brigade. From this they formed a striking force of two infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades for offensive operations on the Kyber front with the possibility of using it also in the Tochi and Kurram areas. One infantry division and a so-called \\"mounted\\" brigade were also detailed for operations on the Baluchistan‚ÄìZhob front. There were also three frontier brigades as well as a number of frontier militia and irregular corps. Artillery was also in short supply, and the three frontier divisions each had a British field artillery brigade of the Royal Field Artillery with two batteries of 18-pdrs and one battery of 4.5-inch howitzers, and an Indian mountain brigade with two batteries of 2.75-inch mountain guns. There were also two batteries of tractor drawn 6-inch howitzer and two British mountain batteries of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and were reinforced with 3.7-inch mountain howitzers. However, most batteries had only four guns. Finally there were also 15 pounder guns of the Frontier Garrison Artillery. A Royal Air Force Handley Page Type O Machine guns, at least on the Khyber front, were old .303 Maxims. The British gained a command and control advantage with their use of motor transport and wireless communications while armoured cars and RAF detachments increased their firepower and reach, the latter being demonstrated to the Afghans by a bombing raid on Kabul itself. They could also direct the fire of the 60-pdrs. The RAF squadrons involved were No. 31 Squadron and No. 114 Squadron. But the main problem for the British was discontent among their soldiers. The troops in India were no longer as uncritical as they had been when considering what they were being asked to do. Like other units of the British Army many of the troops considered the war over and looked forward to being demobilised. The Indian Army had been heavily committed to the First World War and had suffered a large number of casualties.The Indian Army sent over a million men overseas, and suffered approximately 115,000 casualties, see First World War casualties. Many of its units still had not returned from overseas, and those that had, had begun the process of demobilisation and as such many regiments had lost almost all their most experienced men. Likewise, the British Army in India had been gutted. Prior to 1914 there had been 61 British regimentsThe term regiments in this case is used to describe infantry battalions, or cavalry regiments. serving in India. However, of these all but 10 (two cavalry and eight infantry) had been withdrawn in order to fight in Europe or the Middle East. In their place, units of the Territorial Army (TA), part-time soldiers usually only intended for home defence but who had volunteered for overseas service, had been sent in order to release regular units for the fighting in France.The order of battle shows, however, that of the 13 British infantry battalions nine were regular, although they had many men who had only volunteered for the First World War. One of the TA battalions had previously been engaged in operations in Waziristan in 1917. After four years of mundane garrison duty, away from their families and disaffected, most of these men were really only interested in demobilisation and returning to Britain to get on with their lives. They were in no way prepared for a hard-fought campaign on the Indian frontier. Course of the war The conflict began on 3 May 1919 when Afghan troops crossed the frontier at the western end of the Khyber Pass and captured the town of Bagh. Bagh was strategically important to the British and Indians as it provided water to Landi Kotal, which was at the time garrisoned by just two companies of troops from the British Indian Army. Although initially considered a minor border infraction, this attack was actually part of the wider invasion plan. For whatever reason the attack had been launched ahead of schedule, however, for Amanullah had intended initially to time it to coincide with an uprising that was being planned in Peshawar for 8 May. This served to alert the British Chief Commissioner of the North West Frontier, Sir George Roos-Keppel, who had become aware of the plan and as a result he was able to successfully convince the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, of the need to respond to the occupation of Bagh before it led to further unrest in Peshawar. In response to this the British Indian government declared war upon Afghanistan on 6 May and ordered a general mobilisation of the British and Indian forces. It was decided next that the two companies of Sikhs and Gurkhas that had been sent to Landi Kotal needed to be reinforced, however, the mobilisation process had only just begun and at that stage there was only one battalion available for this, so on 7 May the 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry were brought up clandestinely through the Khyber Pass aboard a convoy of 37 lorries. Meanwhile, a cordon was thrown around Peshawar and demands were made for the population to hand over the uprising's ringleaders. Amid threats that the city's water supply would be cut, the inhabitants complied and by dawn on 8 May the situation in the city was under control and the threat of an uprising abated. By this stage more reinforcements were available and the garrison at Landi Kotal grew to brigade-size, with the arrival of the rest of the 1st Infantry Brigade under Brigadier G.D. Crocker. On 9 May the British and Indian troops launched an attack on the Afghans that had seized Bagh the previous week. The attack, however, failed when the brigade commander decided to split his forces and detach almost half his force to protect his flank and as a result was unable to achieve the necessary concentration of force to capture all of his objectives. Coinciding with this, three BE2c aircraft from the Royal Air Force carried out a bombing raid on Dacca in Afghanistan, attacking a group of hostile tribesmen. identifies these aircraft as two Sopwith Camels. A Royal Air Force BE2C Following this the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades of the 1st Infantry Division were dispatched from Nowshera and Abbottabad, concentrating at Jamrud and Kacha Garhi. At the same time, the 6th Brigade from the 2nd Infantry Division moved up to Peshawar from Rawalpindi to help quell the unrest there. Two days later, on 11 May, a second attack was made on Bagh by the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades, under Major General Fowler, and this time it proved successful. Supported with 22 machine guns and 18 artillery pieces, the attack was preceded by a thirty-minute preparation bombardment before being carried by the 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment and two battalions from the 11th Gurkhas who charged into the Afghan positions with bayonets fixed and drove them into the Lower Khyber where they were subjected to further indirect fire from mountain guns that had been set up in ambush. As the Afghans were forced back over the border the RAF followed them across and carried out a number of bombing runs. The rout was total and the tribesman that might have otherwise have been expected to counterattack in support of the Afghans decided against doing so, instead turning their efforts to looting the battlefield and gathering the arms and ammunition that the retreating Afghans had left behind. Casualties during the battle, later known as the Second Battle of Bagh, amounted to 100 Afghans killed and 300 wounded, while the British and Indian forces lost eight killed and 31 wounded. Although Amanullah continued to profess that he had no untoward intentions, Roos-Keppel decided that it was prudent to continue the advance and ordered the army to pursue the Afghans across the border. On 13 May British and Indian troops seized control of the western Khyber without opposition and occupied Dacca, however, the British camp was poorly sited for defence and as a consequence they came under an intense long-range artillery barrage from Afghan artillery before Amanullah launched an infantry assault on them. This assault was defeated and the British launched a counter-attack the following day, however, they were unable to consolidate their position and as a result it was not until 17 May that the area was secured and the Afghans withdrew. Meanwhile, the previous day, British and Indian forces had launched an attack on 'Stonehenge Ridge', where an Afghan force of about 3,000 men had established themselves with a number of artillery pieces and machine guns. Under cover of a preliminary bombardment to soften up the Afghan defences, men from the 11th Sikhs had launched the initial assault, however, they were forced to stop their attack when they ran out of ammunition at 08.00 hours, and although a resupply was effected at 10.30 hours, it was not until 14.00 hours that the attack was able to be recommenced. By this time the troops were exposed to the heat of the day; nevertheless, after another barrage was called down, the Sikhs attacked the Afghan line despite the heat and the attack was carried to the top of the ridge. Upon reaching the escarpment they found that the Afghans had left the battlefield, leaving most of their equipment, artillery and a number of standards. During the assault the British and Indian forces lost 22 killed and 157 wounded, while Afghan losses were estimated at around 200 killed and 400 wounded. At this time, however, trouble struck in the British rear along their line of communications through the Khyber where the Khyber Rifles began to become disaffected by the situation and began to desert en masse. As a result, it was decided to disarm and disband the regiment in an effort to stop the spread of similar sentiment to other regiments. Following this Lord Chelmsford decided that the situation could be resolved by continuing the advance further into Afghanistan and gave the order for the brigade in Dacca to march towards Jalalabad, however, this order was unable to be carried out as fighting broke out further to the south and in the eastern Khyber. As part of the attack on the Khyber, secondary attacks had been planned on Quetta and Kurram, and in the north in Chitral state and in the south in Baluchistan and the Zhob Valley. On 23 May the British posts around the Kurram Valley had to be abandoned. The following day Handley Page bombers attacked Kabul; states that there was only one aircraft involved in this attack, although describes multiple aircraft. however, it did little to stem the tide and the supply situation in Landi Kotal grew worse. On 27 May the British commander in Quetta decided to attack the Afghan fortress at Spin Baldak, capturing it (the last time the British Army used an escalade) and, in the process, seized the initiative in the south; however, the situation in the centre of the war zone, around Kurram, remained desperate for the British. The Afghan forces in this area were under the command of General Nadir Khan uses the name \\"Nadir Shah\\". and he possessed a force of some 14 battalions. Against this, the British at Thal, under Brigadier General Alexander Eustace, possessed only four battalions. To make matters worse, the only troops protecting the upper Tochi Valley were the disaffected North Waziristan Militia. Concerned that they would rise up against him if left to their own devices, Eustace gave the order to abandon the militia outposts but in doing so precipitated the desertion of many of the militiamen. This disaffection spread and the South Waziristan Militia in Wana turned on their officers and any men who had remained loyal and attacked them. The survivors, under Major Russell, the commandant, were forced to fight their way out to a column of the North Zhob Militia which had been sent out to relieve them. Seeing that the situation was deteriorating for the British and seeing an opportunity, Nadir Khan decided to attack Thal. As the Frontier Constabulary had abandoned their posts, on the night of 28/29 May the Afghans were able to occupy a tower from the fort and from there they were able to set fire to a number of food dumps. This made the situation in the fort dire, as the supply situation had already been low. Other factors also stacked up against the British. Eustace's force was outnumbered and outgunned. He possessed no regular British infantry and his four battalions were inexperienced Indian units, consisting mainly of young recruits. After repelling an infantry assault on 29 May, the following day the garrison was subjected to a heavy bombardment from Afghan guns. As a result of this, the British decided to bring the 16th Infantry Division, consisting of the 45th and 46th Infantry Brigades, up to Peshawar from Lahore, for the purpose of advancing on Jalalabad and have it move up to Kurram. While part of the division was detached to defend Kohat, the 45th Infantry Brigade under Brigadier General Reginald Dyer‚Äîwho had been at the centre of the Amritsar massacre‚Äîset out to relieve Eustace's force at Thal. Dyer's force consisted of only one British battalion, the 1st/25th London Regiment, as well as Dogras, Punjabis and Gurkhas, and short of rations and possessing no transport, they were forced to march through intense heat to effect the relief. Despite the conditions, however, the British and Indian troops under Dyer's command rose to the occasion and covered the last in under 12 hours and on 1 June they ran into a blocking force of tribesman that barred both the northern and southern approaches to Thal. Dyer attacked both ends with his artillery, while sending his infantry against the southern approach. Unable to withstand the attack, the tribesmen withdrew and as a result the way through to Eustace's garrison was cleared. During the siege, the British suffered 94 casualties, of which eight were killed, four died of wounds and 82 were wounded. The next day, 2 June, at dawn Dyer's brigade launched an attack on the Afghan regulars that were positioned away to the west of Thal and as this attack went in Nadir Khan sent out an envoy to deliver a message to the brigade commander. The message told Dyer that Amir Amanullah had ordered Nadir Khan to cease hostilities and Nadir Khan asked Dyer to acknowledge that he would honour the request for an armistice that Amanullah had sent to the British Indian government on 31 May. Unaware that this request had been made, and uncertain as to whether the message and request for a cease fire was a ruse on Nadir Khan's part, Dyer decided that he would not take any chances and sent the reply: \\"My guns will give an immediate reply, but your letter will be forwarded to the Divisional Commander\\". After this Dyer continued his attack and as Nadir Khan's force withdrew from the area, Dyer followed them up with cavalry and armoured cars from the 37th Lancers, while the RAF, using machine guns and iron bombs, attacked and dispersed about 400 tribesmen that were in the area and which posed a threat of counterattack. On 3 June, the Afghan camp at Yusef Khel was seized by two platoons from the 1st/25th London and two troops from the 37th Lancers supported by a section of guns from the 89th Battery, and shortly afterwards the armistice was signed. With this a cease fire came into effect, however, some fighting continued, particularly in Chitral and in North Baluchistan, and it was not until 8 August 1919 that the settlement was finally concluded when the Treaty of Rawalpindi was signed. Importance of British airpower Aerial photography of the Amir's palace during the bombing raid on Kabul Afghanistan on 24 May 1919 Although limited in numbers and quality, describes British air assets as being \\"war torn\\" and lacking power to fly over the mountains, instead having to fly through the Khyber Pass or using gusts of wind to clear obstacles. airpower proved to be one of the greatest assets that the British possessed during this conflict. Not only did it allow them to extend their reach beyond the border and bomb Kabul, but it also enabled them to harass the retreating enemy and to break up tribesmen as they attempted to form larger groups prior to launching an attack. The ability of the British to project airpower, even small scale raids, had considerable psychological effects. For example, the single-plane raid on the palace which took place on 24 May 1919, although effecting little actual damage nevertheless greatly impacted the morale of Afghan citizens and contributed to bringing King Amanullah to request an armistice. Indeed, as a result of the war and the lessons that were learned about the potential of airpower in the region, following the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard, proposed controlling the frontier by air power alone. This plan had proved highly successful in Mesopotamia, Aden and the Transjordan, however, due to the uniqueness of the North-West Frontier and also due to inter-service politics the plan was not accepted until later. In 1937, it was eventually decided that should another war break out with Afghanistan, or in the event of a major tribal uprising, the RAF would take the offensive, while the ground forces would act defensively. During the course of the conflict, British aircraft losses included at least one plane crashed and two shot down. King Amanullah objected to the British about the air raids on Kabul citing British condemnation of the German Zeppelin attacks on London. In his letter to the British government he said, \\"It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by Zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation, while now we see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent amongst all civilized people of the West.\\" Outcome 2nd/5th Royal Gurkha Rifles, North-West Frontier 1923 Casualties during the conflict amounted to approximately 1,000 Afghans killed in action, while the British and Indian forces lost 236 killed in action. In addition, 615 were wounded, 566 died from cholera, and 334 died as a result of other diseases and accidents. Regardless of casualties, the outcome of the Third Anglo-Afghan War remains contentious. Ostensibly, the result of the conflict was a British tactical victory. This is by virtue of the fact that the British repulsed the Afghan invasion and drove them from Indian territory, while Afghan cities were subjected to attack by Royal Air Force bombers. Nevertheless, the Afghans were ultimately able to secure their strategic political goals in the aftermath of the conflict. Thus the extent of the British tactical victory was limited, and the Afghans also made strategic gains. The circumstances behind the war were complicated as was the final settlement. In going to war in 1919 against British India, Amir Amanullah's war aims were complicated. Even up against a depleted British Indian Army, a tactical victory was unlikely; however, the war served the dual purpose of deflecting domestic criticism and also offering the opportunity for strategic political gains. As a result of the peace treaty that was negotiated, the British ceased payment of the Afghan subsidy, and thus ended their claim to direct Afghan foreign policy, which had been the quid pro quo of the Emir accepting the subsidy. The British had traditionally wanted Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and the Russian Empire. In 1919, the Russian Civil War was raging and any threat from Russia to India at the time was potential rather than real. Moreover, the British were by far the largest supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War with the British contributing more arms to the Whites than all other nations combined. It was assumed in London that if the Whites won the Civil War, a new era in Anglo-Russian relations might possibly open as the victorious Whites might be grateful for British support, rendering the need for a buffer state in Central Asia irrelevant. The British also stopped arms sales from India to Afghanistan. But, as British influence declined, the Afghans were able to gain control of their own foreign affairs and in the aftermath emerged as a fully independent state. The British also made some political gains, most notably the reaffirmation of the Durand Line ‚Äì which had long been a contentious issue between the two nations ‚Äì as a border separating Afghanistan from the North-West Frontier, and the undertaking that the Afghans made to stop interference on the British side of the line. Although the fighting concluded in August 1919, its effects continued to be felt in the region for some time afterwards. The nationalism and disruption that it had sparked stirred up more unrest in the years to come, particularly in Waziristan. The tribesmen, always ready to exploit governmental weakness, whether real or perceived, banded together in the common cause of disorder and unrest. They had become well-armed as a result of the conflict, whence they benefitted greatly from the weapons and ammunition that the Afghans had left behind and from an influx of manpower in large numbers of deserters from the militia that had joined their ranks. With these additions they launched a campaign of resistance against British authority on the North-West Frontier that was to last until the end of the Raj. Battle honours The Nawab of Bahawalpur, Sadeq Mohammad Khan V, fought for the British during the Third Anglo-Afghan War British and Indian infantry units that participated in the conflict received the battle honour \\"Afghanistan 1919\\". No other battle honours for individual engagements were issued. Additionally, unlike the first two Anglo-Afghan wars where individual campaign ribbons were issued for separate engagements, no campaign medal was struck for this conflict. Instead, participation in this conflict was recognised by a clasp to the India General Service Medal (1908‚Äì1935). The award of the battle honour was made in four separate Army and Governor General's orders. The earliest, Army Order 97/24, granted the honour to 14 British units. Governor General's Order 193/26 made awards to Indian Army Corps. Governor General's Order 1409/26 made awards to Indian States Forces and finally a further Governor General's Order in 1927 made awards to a further three Gurkha regiments. The Army Order was unusual in that a mistake was made in awarding the Afghanistan 1919 battle honour to The Hampshire Regiment and the 21st Lancers. This was subsequently rectified and the award to these two units was withdrawn.

The honour was not awarded to regiments that had been disbanded, e.g. 11th Gurkha Rifles, and that not all units that took part in the war were awarded the battle honour, e.g. 1/5th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment.

The war was part of the Great Game between the British and Russian empires. The war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the British invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the Amir - Sher Ali Khan to flee. Ali's successor Mohammad Yaqub Khan immediately sued for peace and the Treaty of Gandamak was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir Louis Cavagnari to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by Ayub Khan which led to the abdication of Yaqub. The second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British decisively defeated Ayub Khan outside Kandahar. A new Amir - Abdur Rahman Khan selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.Barfield p. 145 Background After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too. The Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under Neville Bowles Chamberlain, but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. Lord Lytton, the viceroy of India, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo‚ÄìAfghan War. War First phase The first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the Battle of Ali Masjid and the Battle of Peiwar Kotal meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict at britishempire.co.uk An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \\"India and Afghanistan, 1876\\", p. 183. He returned to Mazar-i-Sharif, where he died on 21 February 1879. Treaty With British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, signed the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the Khyber and Michni passes, and Afghanistan ceded various North-West Frontier Province areas and Quetta to Britain. The British Army then withdrew. However, on 3 September 1879 an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of Sir Louis Cavagnari, the British representative, along with his guards, and staff ‚Äì provoking the next phase of the Second Afghan War.

Ghazi Mohammad Jan Khan Wardak, and a force of 10,000 Afghans, staged an uprising and attacked British forces near Kabul in the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment in December 1879. Despite besieging the British garrison there, he failed to maintain the Siege of Sherpur, instead shifting focus to Roberts' force, and this resulted in the collapse of this rebellion. Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother Ayub Khan on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar. British Crown within wreath on the obverse, Arabic inscription in four lines on the reverse. These issues were struck under local authorities who routinely recalled and devalued the coppers. This abusive practice lead to a great variety of types, often featuring various animal or flower motifs. Accordingly, the types on this coin were likely not ordered by the occupation authorities, but rather placed by an opportunistic engraver eager to please the occupiers. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Maiwand in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan on 1 September at the Battle of Kandahar, bringing his rebellion to an end. Aftermath The Afghan revolt: Herati Soldiers 1879 With Ayub Khan defeated, the war was officially over and the British selected and supported a new Amir - Abdur Rahman Khan son of Muhammad Afzal and nephew of the former Amir Sher Ali. Rahman confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, whereby the British took control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan, and also of Afghanistan's foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. The Afghan tribes maintained internal rule and local customs, and provided a continuing buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew from the region. By April 1881 all British and Indian troops had left Afghanistan, but British Indian agents were left behind to smooth liaison between the governments. No further trouble resulted between Afghanistan and British India during Rahman's period of rule, and he became known as the 'iron Amir'. The Russians kept well out of Afghan internal affairs, with the exception of the Panjdeh incident three years later, resolved by arbitration and negotiation after an initial British ultimatum.Conflict in Afghanistan: A Historical Encyclopedia By Clements, F. ABC-Clio, Santa Barbara, California, 2003 p. 198 In 1893, Mortimer Durand was despatched to Kabul by British India to sign an agreement with Rahman for fixing the limits of their respective spheres of influence as well as improving diplomatic relations and trade. On November 12, 1893, the Durand Line Agreement was reached. leading to the creation of a new North-West Frontier Province.

Superficially resembling ditches or trenches, they range in length from to almost and the distance between the parallel earthworks can be up to . Banks at the terminal ends enclose the cursus. Over fifty have been identified via aerial photography while many others have doubtless been obliterated by farming and other subsequent landscaping activities.Peter James and Nick Thorpe (November 1999) \\"Ancient Mysteries\\", p,316-9. Examples include the four cursuses at Rudston in Yorkshire, that at Fornham All Saints in Suffolk, the Cleaven Dyke in Perthshire and the Dorset cursus.Champion, 2005 A notable example is the Stonehenge Cursus, within sight of the more famous stone circle, on land belonging to The National Trust's Stonehenge Landscape.  Function  Tynwald Hill, Isle of Man It has been conjectured that they were used in rituals connected with ancestor veneration, that they follow astronomical alignments or that they served as buffer zones between ceremonial and occupation landscapes. More recent studies have reassessed the original interpretation and argued that they were used for ceremonial competitions. Finds of arrowheads at the terminal ends suggest archery and hunting were important to the builders and that the length of the cursus may have reflected its use as a proving ground for young men involving a journey to adulthood. Anthropological parallels exist for this interpretation. Contemporary internal features are rare and it has been traditionally thought that the curs≈´s were used as processional routes. They are often aligned on and respect the position of pre-existing long barrows and bank barrows and appear to ignore difficulties in terrain. The Dorset Cursus, the longest known example, crosses a river and three valleys along its course across Cranborne Chase and is close to the henge monuments at Knowlton. The present-day Tynwald day ceremony on the Isle of Man involves the procession of parliament along a cursus-like structure, which is sometimes suggested as a related or continual folk tradition with the neolithic cursus. Larger scale modern ceremonial analogs might include the National Mall in Washington, and The Mall, London. Identification by aerial photography Numerous examples of cursus are known and the discipline of aerial archaeology is the most effective method of identifying such large features following thousands of years of weathering and plough damage.English Heritage Some cursus have only been identified through a first sighting of cropmarks visible from aerial reconnaissance; for example, the cropmarks at Fetteresso were the first indication of a cursus at that location in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.Hogan, 2008  Etymology  'Cursus' (plural 'curs≈´s' or 'cursuses') was a name given by early British archaeologists such as William Stukeley to the large parallel lengths of banks with external ditches which they thought were early Roman athletic courses, after the Latin word cursus, meaning \\"course\\".

Lover (January 1, 1910 in Kalamazoo, Michigan - January 31, 1997 in Garden Grove, California) was a designer of amplifiers and musical instrument electronics and effects. He is most famous for developing the Gibson humbucker or hum-cancelling electric stringed instrument pickup, most often used on the electric guitar. Life and career Seth Lover began working with electronics as a child, and continued working with them during and after his first service with the US Army in the 1930s. He then worked in an electronics shop in Kalamazoo, repairing radios and building amplifiers. In the 1940s he worked for Gibson Guitars before joining the service a second time during World War II. During the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, his career fluctuated between working for Gibson and the US Navy. He developed the humbucking pickup for Gibson in 1955, and designed the first fuzztone distortion device, called the Varitone, in 1961. He stayed with Gibson until 1967 when he took a designing job with Fender Musical Instruments. Lover died on January 31, 1997 at the age of 87 after a brief illness. He was survived by his wife, his two sons, and his three grandchildren. Designs with Gibson, Fender, and Seymour Duncan With Gibson Lover's most famous humbucker design was the P.A.F. (Patent Applied For) designed while working for Gibson in 1955. This pickup was utilized in a range of Gibson guitars, most notably the Les Paul model. Before Lover, electric guitarists were forced to cope with the 60-cycle hum received by single coil pickups. It was in the mid-'50s, while working as an amplifier designer at Gibson Guitars, that Lover figured out how to wire two coils electrically out of phase and with reversed magnetic polarities. The effect was to cancel the hum before it reached the amp and the result was the birth of the humbucking pickup.The humbucking pickup was simultaneously and independently developed by Ray Butts, whose patent application was slightly earlier than Lover's; Butts' pickup was licensed to Gretsch as the Filter'Tron Lover applied for the patent on the humbucking pickup in 1955 and it was finally granted in 1959 (). During this five-year period, Gibson adhered a \\"Patent Applied For\\" sticker to the underside of their humbucker pickups. These \\"P.A.F.\\" pickups are among the most collectable and desirable pickups today, fetching upwards of $1,000 each among vintage guitar collectors. While working under Ted McCarty at Gibson, Lover was also involved in guitar design. He liked to tell how he helped contribute to the design of the famous \\"Flying V.\\" Lover said that he thought up the design as a way to lean the guitar against a wall without it tipping over. Lover worked for Gibson from 1952 to 1967 as a design engineer. With Fender Another of his designs, known as the Fender Wide Range humbucking pickup (WRHP), was used in the three Telecaster models (Deluxe, Custom, and Thinline) produced by Fender in the 1960-1970s. The Wide Range pickup was also used in the Fender Starcaster. In 1967, he transferred to Fender Musical Instruments where he worked until 1975 as a project engineer. In addition to his two Gibson patents, he authored three more at Fender‚Äîtwo for loudspeaker cabinets and one for an electric piano pickup. He retired to the Southern California town of Garden Grove. With Seymour Duncan Seymour W. Duncan, a guitar pickup designer and manufacturer, considered Lover his \\"humbucker mentor.\\" The two were associated for nearly 20 years. In 1994, Duncan and Lover jointly produced the Seth Lover Model pickup, a re-creation of the \\"Patent Applied For\\" humbucker. After numerous full-page ads, NAMM Show appearances, and magazine interviews, Lover became a minor celebrity at age 84. During his final years, Lover was a regular member of the Seymour Duncan NAMM-team.

Both genera were formerly thought to represent the distinct families Lepidosirenidae and Protopteridae within the order Lepidosireniformes, but a 2017 study analyzing all post-Devonian lungfish taxa found them to be better classified as different genera in a single family.  Taxonomy  Their closest living relatives are of the family Neoceratodontidae, or the Australian lungfish, with both families being members of the suborder Ceratodontoidei. However, their closest relatives in general are of the extinct Gnathorhizidae, which forms a sister group to Lepidosirenidae. The clade containing both families forms a sister group to the extinct family Ptychoceratodontidae. The earliest fossils for the family come from the Late Cretaceous, around 99.7 MYA, but phylogenetic evidence indicates the two genera split at the very beginning of the Early Cretaceous, around 145 MYA, and the family itself originated during the end-Carboniferous period.  Biology  All lungfish of the order can and often do estivate (with the exception of the Spotted African lungfish, which can but rarely does so). As well, the order is composed entirely of obligatory air-breathers; only the Australian lungfish has functioning gills in the adult members of the species whilst members of this order only have gills in the larvae. The lungfish also all have generally small scales and two lungs as opposed to the Australian lungfish's single lung.

Early life and studies Spence was born into a musical family that had once owned the London piano manufacturer Squire Pianos. His father was a doctor, and his mother a pianist who worked as an archivist at the Royal College of Music. She had also been personal assistant to Walter Legge and Yehudi Menuhin, and artists and musicians were regular lunch guests at the family home.

He continued his vocal studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he studied with David Pollard with whom he has continued vocal studies. Career Spence's professional debut was in 1995 as Idamante in Welsh National Opera's production of Idomeneo, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras; he repeated the role later the same year in Munich after only one day of rehearsal. Other early engagements included La Calisto with Ren√© Jacobs in Brussels, Mitridate in Mitridate R√® di Ponto under Roger Norrington at the Mozart week in Salzburg, and subsequently at the Salzburg Summer Festival, Almaviva in Rossini's The Barber of Seville at the English National Opera, and David in Die Meistersinger under Antonio Pappano at La Monnaie in Brussels. At the same time he was performing on the concert platform in repertoire ranging from Beethoven's Missa Solemnis to Saint Fran√ßois d'Assise by Messiaen. Toby Spence has on-going connections with English National Opera (ENO), and is a strong believer of the policy of singing in English. He appeared in successive seasons at the Op√©ra National de Paris and also at the Bavarian State Opera (Bayerische Staatsoper). He was the first Ferdinand in Thomas Ad√®s' opera The Tempest at Covent Garden, and reprised the role in the work's American premiere production at Santa Fe Opera. He has since performed the role of Antonio in the same opera. Following The Tempest he has been invited back regularly to Covent Garden in operas by Rossini, Jan√°ƒçek and Wagner.Results for Toby Spence in the Royal Opera House Collections Online. accessed 4 November 2014. He made his Proms debut in 1997, in a performance of the Schubert Mass No. 5 in A flat, following this with Nielsen's Springtime on Funen in 1999, the Bach St John Passion and Parsifal in 2000, Handel's Acis and Galatea in 2001, Les Troyens √† Carthage in 2003, Les noces in 2004, the Missa solemnis in 2005, Delius A Song of the High Hills in 2009 and Beethoven's Choral Symphony in 2011.BBC Proms database, accessed 13 November 2011.

The latter role was one Spence was keen to play from the start of his career, and he has sung it in several productions around the world. Although he sang in some recitals at the beginning of his professional career, he was dissatisfied with the result and set song to one side for several years. When he resumed recitals his repertoire included Poulenc, Brahms and Britten, as well as the original version of Les nuits d'√©t√© with piano. In an interview for the Paris Opera in 2008, Spence named Ars√®ne Wenger as his non-musical hero.Chanter la d√©bauche et la perdition. Ligne 8. Le journal de l'Op√©ra National de Paris.

He enjoys travelling and in 2003 spent four weeks backpacking around Iran, visiting several cities. His marriage ended in divorce in 2001. In December 2011, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and underwent surgery in February 2012 to remove his glands and lymph nodes. In May 2012, he received the award for Singer of the Year from the Royal Philharmonic Society, and that August sang in public at the Edinburgh Festival for the first time since his operation. In 2012, Toby and his brother, Magnus Spence, founded a festival of song at Wardsbrook, a farm in East Sussex where Magnus lives with his family. Since its inauguration they have presented recitals by St√©phane Degout, Sarah Connolly, Sir Thomas Allen, Christiane Karg, Felicity Lott, Ian Bostridge and Gyula Orendt. The aim of Wardsbrook is to promote the art of song and raise much needed funds for St Michael's Hospice in St Leonard's, Hastings, which provides palliative care for the community.

Anthony, Duke of Brabant, also known as Antoine de Brabant, Antoine de Bourgogne and Anthony of Burgundy (August 1384 - 25 October 1415), was Count of Rethel (1402‚Äì1406), Duke of Brabant, Lothier and Limburg (1406‚Äì1415), and Co-Duke of Luxemburg (1411-1415). He was killed at the battle of Agincourt.  Biography  Anthony was the son of Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, and brother of John the Fearless.Willem Pieter Blockmans and Walter Prevenier, The Promised Lands: The Low Countries under Burgundian rule, 1369‚Äì1530, (University Pennsylvania Press, 1999), 30-31. When his grandaunt Joanna died childless in 1406, Anthony inherited the Duchy of Brabant, Lothier, and Limburg, thus becoming the first Brabantian ruler of the House of Valois. The Duke of Brabant arrived late to the Battle of Agincourt, and in his eagerness to reach the field, he dressed in improvised armour and wore a surcoat made from a trumpeter's flag. He fought valiantly but was captured by some English archers. He was executed along with the rest of the prisoners ordered by Henry V of England, the English being unaware of his high status and ransom value.The Battle of Agincourt: Sources and Interpretations, ed. Anne Curry, (The Boydell Press, 2000), 174. The execution was carried out as the much smaller English force found itself stretched to its limits, guarding prisoners with the battle still not won. A counterattack on the King's baggage train (guarded only by women and children) is thought to have driven King Henry to the decision, thinking he was being attacked from the rear and some chroniclers have given Brabant's belated charge as this very cause, adding to the Duke's chivalric but tragic final story (see \\"Agincourt\\", J. Barker 2005). Subsequently the executions stopped immediately when the attack was seen to falter.  Marriages and family  He married at Arras on 21 February 1402 Jeanne of Saint-Pol (d. 1407), daughter of Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny and Saint-Pol.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Bold, (The Boydell Press, 2009), 90.
