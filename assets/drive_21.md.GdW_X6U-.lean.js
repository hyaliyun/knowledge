In addition to phonological systems, he also studies writing systems, in particular the evolution of Indic scripts in Southeast Asia.  Biography  Michel Ferlus was born in 1935. He followed classes in ethnology and prehistory taught by Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan; in 'primitive religions' by Roger Bastide; in linguistics by Andr√© Martinet; and in Southeast Asian languages and history by George C≈ìd√®s. He worked in Laos as a teacher from 1961 to 1968. This allowed him to do fieldwork on languages of Laos, including Hmong and Yao (Hmong-Mien family), Khmu/Khamou and Lamet (Austroasiatic/Mon-Khmer), as well as Phu Noi/Phou-Noy (Sino-Tibetan). He became a researcher at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in 1968. He mainly did fieldwork in Thailand and Burma (Myanmar) in the 1980s, studying Wa, Lawa, Palaung, Mon and Nyah Kur; in Vietnam and Laos in the 1990s, studying Viet-Muong (also known as Vietic) languages, and the Tai languages and writing systems of northern and central areas of Vietnam, including the Lai Pao writing system of Vietnam, which was close to falling into oblivion.A Vietnamese TV programme about fieldwork on the Lai Pao script by Michel Ferlus and Tr·∫ßn Tr√≠ D√µi He has published extensively about his findings on numerous languages of Laos, Thailand, Burma/Myanmar, and Vietnam, in journals such as Mon-Khmer Studies, Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orientale, and Diachronica. Main findings Michel Ferlus's main discoveries relate to the effects of monosyllabicization on the phonological structure of Southeast Asian languages. Tonogenesis (the development of lexical tones), registrogenesis (the development of lexically contrastive phonation-type registers), the evolution of vowel systems all partake in a general (panchronic) model of evolution.Ferlus, Michel. 1979. ‚ÄúFormation Des Registres Et Mutations Consonantiques Dans Les Langues Mon- khmer.‚Äù Mon-Khmer Studies 8: 1‚Äì76.

The wetlands are approximately southwest of Melbourne, and sit within the Municipal Councils of Hobsons Bay and Wyndham City. The wetlands are part of the Point Cook Coastal Park and are crown land for conservation purposes. The area is currently managed by the Department of Sustainability & Environment and Melbourne Water, with Parks Victoria informally managing the area to the north of the wetlands. They are protected under the Ramsar Convention. Cheetham Wetlands Map at the entrance to the park.  Land use  The Cheetham Wetlands were originally a natural salt marsh and grassy woodlands; the area was later used as a saltworks. The later use created the lagoons, which attract many birds to the area. In 1996, the land was set aside to protect the wetland system and its diverse fauna and flora, including migratory birds. View of Cheetham Wetlands from the viewing deck.  Ecological processes  Even though Cheetham Wetlands is made up of artificial wetland lagoons, the ecological processes that they create are significant in sustaining values under the Ramsar Convention. The wetlands also provide the following functions: * Ground water recharge or discharge; * Water purification; * Water storage; * Nutrient recycling; * Sewage treatment; * Shoreline stability; and * Retention of sediment.  Significant species  The Cheetham Wetlands has been known to support over two hundred species of birds, with many birds returning each year. The birds found in the area breed mainly in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and migrate to the Southern Hemisphere between July and November; bird numbers peak in the Point Cook Coastal Park area between September and March. The Wetlands currently support significant populations of: * Red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis) * Red-necked avocet (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) * Sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata) * Double-banded plover (Charadrius bicinctus) * Common greenshank (Tringa nebularia) * Marsh sandpiper (Tringa stagnatilis) * Curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) * Orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) * Fairy tern (Sterna nereis) * Common tern (Sterna hirundo) * Yellow sedge-skipper (Hesperilla flavescens)  Environmental threats  Wetland areas have been identified as some of the most threatened habitats in the world. The Cheetham Wetlands are no exception and are currently under threat by a number of natural and man-made sources.  Urban encroachment  One of the biggest threats is encroachment on the land, especially from the rapidly expanding municipality of Wyndham City. In Victoria‚Äôs integrated planning document, Melbourne 2030, the Werribee growth area was identified as one of five growth areas. The urban land boundary for Wyndham abuts Point Cook Coastal Park to the west and north. The increased demand for housing and development in the area has and will continue to change the nature and character of Point Cook Coastal Park and Cheetham Wetlands.  Water quality  Decreasing water quality of the wetlands due to storm water treatment, drainage and hard rubbish has also been identified as a threat. The wetlands' water levels are managed by pumping and water flow controls onsite. The correct maintenance and operation of these processes is critical to maintaining the Ramsar sites. Pumping water into the wetlands when there are high freshwater flows can result in sediment and nutrient pollution from storm water.  Pests  Further threats have been identified in the area, with disturbance of migratory shorebirds and their habitats by human activities. Examples are allowing pets in the area and the area being used as a recreational reserve. There is also a significant threat posed by introduced or exotic fauna and flora species, including feral cats, foxes and rabbits. Pest signage at Cheetham Wetlands  Management and conservation programs  Cheetham Wetlands has been identified as a significant environmental area and as such management, conservation and protection plans have been implemented are currently implemented or being developed for the future. Some of the programs currently being undertaken onsite include: * Melbourne Water in conjunction with Hobson‚Äôs Bay Council recently planted a stretch of land within the wetlands, with indigenous plants. This has restored canopy and habitat connectivity to the area. The hope is that this will encourage native species into the area and provide some coverage from pests. * Cheetham Wetlands was chosen as one of 10 sites under the \\"Revive our Wetlands focus project\\", with financial assistance provided from 2004-2006. This program was created to engage the community in conservation, restore habitat for endangered species, improve water quality, reduce litter and help record accurate wildlife records. * Significant salt marsh regeneration and planting of Thatching grass (Gahnia filum) has been done at the wetlands. This included the removal of invasive woody weed boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum). This weed species competes with the Thatching grass, which is necessary for the survival of the Yellow Sedge-Skipper (Hesperilla Flavescens). * The Shorebird Conservation Project (SCP), which is funded by the Natural Heritage Trust and coordinated by WWF Australia. This project aims to increase awareness, understanding and involvement by local people in conservation of habitat, and enable communities to conserve and wisely manage important shorebird sites. * The Ramsar Protection Plan (pest plant and animal control program), funded by the Caring for our Country program. This program is aimed at conserving areas of national significance and combatting the issues of weed and feral animals within these areas. As part of this program 200 hectares of the wetlands will have rabbit proof fencing installed. * River Health Program: Improving protection for the Cheetham Wetlands and water quality entering the bay, through implementing priority actions from the Melton and Wyndham Storm water management Plan.  Benefits of management  Management practices implemented have included limiting access to the wetland and allowing walking only, into the grassland area abutting the wetlands, creating designated walking tracks and boardwalks and offering two viewing decks of the area. These practices help to ensure that the natural habitats of the wetlands are not disturbed and can be conserved. After a study conducted in 2008, it was found that people were still accessing areas of the Point Cook Coastal Park, including the Cheetham Wetlands that were off bounds to the general public. This study gave management an indication that these types of activities occurred more during holiday periods. To combat this further signage was erected and patrols were set up for peak times. Management programs, including listing the site as a Ramsar wetland, the creation of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsular Ramsar Site: Strategic Management Plan, and declaring the area around Point Cook Coastal Park as a marine reserve, all contribute to the conservation of Cheetham wetlands. The area being listed as a Ramsar site ensures that any proposed development in the area must go through an EPBC process as a minimum. The creation of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsular Ramsar Site: Strategic Management Plan identified key threats to the sites and assessed and proposed implementation of strategies to combat these threats. Management of the water regime for the Cheetham Wetlands, which is dependent on the pumping of seawater from the estuary of Skeleton Creek, also contributes to the conservation of the area. In the late 1980s, the area was still managed as a salt works and pumping of seawater and salt production were suspended for two years. By the second year, summer counts of waterbirds had declined by 85%. The resumption of pumping resulted in an immediate recovery in waterbird numbers. The ongoing conservation programs listed above also benefit the unique and varying flora and fauna species that inhabit the area. Of particular note is the conservation of habitats for the Orange- Bellied Parrot and the Yellowish-Sedge Skipper, both of which are listed as critically endangered.

After studying in the Radun Yeshiva for 18 years under the Chofetz Chaim, Rabbi Aryeh Leib was granted Semicha and appointed the Rabbi of Grozovo, Belarus. Later that year, he was appointed Rabbi of Maryina Gorka and Pukhovichi, Belarus. As a result of Soviet anti- religious and anti-Semitic persecutions, Rabbi Aryeh Leib was jailed in 1933. As a result of this further persecution, Aryeh Leib and his family was ordered to evacuate Pukhovichi, due its proximity to the Soviet-Polish border, within 24 hours. He was officially hired as the bookkeeper of the Smolensk Synagogue, but covertly fulfilled the responsibilities of a communal rabbi as well. On October 17, 1937, the NKVD arrested Rabbi Aryeh Leib. After a lengthy interrogation, they presented him with two options: either to become a secret informant or to become a political prisoner. He was given a day to consider his decision. He returned the following day, adamantly refusing the former and was arrested as a political prisoner. When he was arrested, his library of religious books and his own manuscripts of religious writings were taken by the Soviets. Some of it was immediately destroyed and the rest placed in Soviet archives. He was convicted by a Troika on falsified charges, ranging from counter-revolutionary activities to Trotskyism, on November 12, 1937 and was sentenced to death by firing squad. Despite extended and intense torture, he never confessed to any of the charges made against him. Despite the opportunity to become an informant and avert his fate, he never compromised his principles. His death sentence was carried out in the basement of the NKVD prison in Smolensk on November 19, 1937.

When he finds Kitosch in a compromising situation with his own wife the Don brands Kitosch, so \\"he doesn't forget who is the boss.‚Äù Kitosch leaves but is caught and beaten. Next time he draws a hidden knife and uses it to get a gun, but the horse he also takes is shot from under him. In town he is arrested on a trumped up charge. The wanted Black Tracy arrives in town on a wagon with a coffin. He is arrested but inside he kills the sheriff and deputy with a hidden derringer. The man who denounced him draws but is killed by a knife throw from Kitosch, who leaves with Tracy. When they are overcome by Don Jaime and his men, Tracy trades Kitosch for the horse of Don Jaime. When they are to hang him Tracy shoots off the rope, and kills a man who draws. When they have left he gives the horse to Kitosch and says goodbye. Kitosch says that he thought they would be together, and Tracy tells him, \\"Don't think, it'll damage your brain.‚Äù Tracy continues and finds that the road ends at a cliff. Kitosch is there waiting under it. He says that Tracy didn't ask about the road. He shows the way to the border, returning the quip about brains. At night Tracy spreads his black leather jacket over Kitosch. When a sheriff and his men sneak in to arrest him they are shot by Tracy. When Kitosch protest against being used as a decoy Tracy replies that he didn't ask, and besides, he wouldn't have been so believable if he'd known. Tracy collects sheriff‚Äôs stars and they both demonstrate their prowess in shooting at them. After burying the coffin ‚Äì with the corpse of his mother who died while he was in jail, Tracy sets out to avenge himself on his wife Traps and best friend Big John, who turned him in for $10.000. They find Traps in a saloon with Big John 's man Slim. Kitosch beats Slim and shoots some Mexicans that interfere. He counts holes in their forehead, and misses one ‚Äì the man rises and is shot!Probably a reference to an episode in For a Few Dollars More. Traps have sensitive eyes and wears a blindfold. Tracy tortures her by exposing her eyes to light. When Kitosch forcibly stops him, Tracy has an epileptic fit. Traps tells Kitosch that she betrayed Tracy because he tortured her, and has scars to show. Tracy returns and promises to leave her alone, if she tells them the whereabouts of Big John. She says that he is at Vulture pass with a band of Mexicans. When they leave Tracy ignites petroleum he has earlier poured out on the floor and she is seen surrounded by flames. At the pass Tracy and Kitosch arrive to see the gangs of Big John and Camaro attack a transport of gold. They attack in waves and gradually decimate the escort. The two now get into the fray and uses dynamite and tricks to kill the bandits. When only Big John and Camaro are left Big John shoots the Mexican, who aims his gun, but is blown up by Kitosch. When the bank clerks venture out of the wagon to extend their thanks they are shot by Tracy, who then pursues Big John while Kitosch kisses the gold. Tracy catches Big John and drags him through the mud, and proceeds to screw his hands into a door. Kitosch protests and then shoots Big John. He rides off saying \\"You know where to find me.‚Äù Tracy cries out \\"He should have suffered a lot more!\\" and has another fit. In town Tracy finds Kitosch spending money on drink and women. Kitosch wants to divide the loot and stay there, ending their partnership. Tracy loads all gold on his horse and goes inside the cantina, where he fingers his gun while he observes Kitosch dancing. When he violently refuses a prostitute there starts a gunfight that develops into a shoot-out with soldiers. The horse carrying the loot cannot be reached, and they escape on other horses. Afterwards Kitosch is upset and starts a fistfight. When Tracy gets the worst of it he draws his derringer, but has a fit when he is about to shoot. Kitosch takes the derringer and holds him during the attack, and when he afterwards is to leave Tracy calls out for him. Tracy recovers in sickbed by the priest in the parish of Don Jaime. He is about to draw at Kitosch's back when he hears about Don Jaime‚Äôs cattle business, and suggests that the two rob him. They are let in at night by the servant girl Rubia. She wants Kitosch to ask Don Jaime for forgiveness and then marry her. He says he will take her with him. Kitosch and Tracy break into Don Jaime's bedroom. Kitosch beats Don Jaime. Rubia enters and tries to stop him. When she calls for help, Tracy shoots her. As the cash is deposited in the bank, Kitosch take Don Jaime's wife as a hostage for $90.000. They take position in the church. The wife comes on to Kitosch, but is rejected. The priest arrives with the ransom, which turns out to be paper. Tracy shoots him. Don Jaime orders his men to attack at dawn. They suffer casualties but take the horses. They withdraw when Tracy takes the wife up in the bell tower, shoots at the bell and threatens to kill her. The wife convinces Tracy that they should leave together and take the money that she says is hidden at the ranch, but Kitosch stops them. He returns Tracy‚Äôs gun when he sees fresh horses outside the church. Don Jaime is in the church with the money. He gives his word of honour that they are free to leave. Tracy now points his gun at Kitosch. He says that the wife goes with him and as for Don Jaime he never leaves a witness. Kitosch provokes Tracy by scorning him for being ‚Äùa poor epileptic.‚Äù He takes one shot without visible effect, and then draws Tracy‚Äôs derringer ‚Äì ‚ÄùYour own little trick‚Äù ‚Äì and shoots him several times, saying that he should have done that the moment they met. Don Jaime leaves him the money, but Kitosch says he will trade it for a horse. Don Jaime helps Kitosch up in the saddle, and waves his men off. He sees blood on his hand and calls out to Kitosch, but the latter continues riding. Reception Il tempo degli avvoltoi was shown as part of a retrospective on Spaghetti Western at the 64th Venice International Film Festival in 2007. In his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Fridlund writes that Il tempo degli avvoltoi, \\"this dark and twisted tale\\", basically presents a variation on the stories of Spaghetti Western films like Death Rides a Horse and Day of Anger, about the relationship between an older gunfighter and a younger protagonist, who joins him and later confronts him, and he further traces the root of this type of plot to the play between the younger and the older bounty killer in For a Few Dollars More. Also, when Tracy's disgust for women causes the loss of their booty, it is a reversal of the situation in Django - and several other films in its wake - where the hero's quest for money brings the loss or brutalisation of his woman.

It was directed by Helmar Lerski and filmed during 1947-1948. The plot of the film focuses on the life of a Jewish boy, who was a Holocaust survivor, trying to rehabilitate himself from the traumas he experienced by working on the land and establishing social relationships while living in the youth village Ben Shemen. The initiator of the film was Dr. Siegfried Lehman the founder of Ben Shemen. He was motivated by a desire to show the world the educational system used in the village and he also had hopes of using the film as a tool for fundraising. The actors in the film were actual pupils in the village and the educational staff also participated in the production. The Plot Benjamin, an adolescent boy, arrives on a bus with other boys who are new arrivals at the village. They are introduced to the class. He is still suffering from trauma and begins to hoard bread taken from storage even though the village has no lack of food. He watches other children at work but feels foreign and alienated. By chance he encounters a barbed wire that fences in a herd of cows. The sight of the barbed wired flashes him back to the Nazi concentration camp. He attacks the fence, destroys it and allows the cows to go free. They damage the vegetable garden. The incident teaches Benjamin that he has much to learn about the values of his new environment. The teachers decide to help in his integration and give him the honored role as torch bearer in the village Hanukah ceremony. The torch is lit at the graves of the Maccabees and carried to the dining hall of the village where it lights the holiday menorah. This has a profound influence on Benjamin and two years later he is the leader of a group graduating from the village to establish a new settlement. His ties to the land of his forefathers reaches fulfillment by working strenuously in preparing the rocky soil for planting. Production Background Dr. Lehman, the director of the youth village, conceived of the idea of making a film to represent the village when he first came to Mandatory Palestine. As early as 1926, Yaakov Ben Dov produced a short film on the first days of Ben Shemen. The success of that film was a main factor in providing incentive for the production of a full blown movie during the 1930s. Practically the film began production only after World War II. Lehman believed that assistance given to needy children in Mandatory Palestine would lead the way to the integration of refugee children who were arriving from Europe with the assistance of Youth Aliyah. An agreement was signed between Ben Shemen and the woman‚Äôs Zionist organization in the U.S.A, Hadassah (the official representative of Youth Aliyah in the U.S.). According to this agreement Hadassah would cover the deficits in the budget of Ben Shemen and assist in funding the film about life in the village. In return Hadassah would have exclusive rights in the film in the U.S.A. The intention was to produce a full blown film with a plot that would move audiences and present the educational achievements of the youth village. Production in British Palestine It is difficult to define the filming of the motion picture as standard or exceptional because, at that time, there was really no film industry standard to compare with. The film was shot totally at its authentic location without use of a film studio, which was a substantial innovation for its time. The idea of using the children of Ben Shemen to play themselves was an original idea. The main acting role in the film was played by Benjamin Hildesheim whose personal story was very similar to that of the role he played. The exception was that Hildesheim had a problem free integration after the war. The authenticity that Lehman and Lersky were hoping for was achieved in the film. The assistant director of the film was Joseph Salzberger and the photographers Sasha Alexander, Robert Ziller, and Naftalie Rubinstein ‚Äì all noted talents in their field. The young Richard Levinson, one of the pupils of the village, assisted by photographing different sites in the village prior to production thus providing opportunity for the professionals to get a detailed understanding of the location. Other assistance came from other well-known experts in the field: Zalman Louvish, Otto Sonenfeld, and Azaria Rapoport.

Career  Arnull was jockey to the Prince of Wales and notorious gambler Dennis O'Kelly on whose horse, Serjeant, he won the fifth running of the Derby in 1784. His younger brother, Sam, had won the inaugural running of the race on board Diomed and his son William would win three Derbies. In 1796, in his forties, he became the second jockey (after Sam Chifney) to win the Derby-Oaks double, winning the former on Didelot and latter on Parisot for Sir Frank Standish. A few years later, he would win another Derby for Standish - the 1799 running on Archduke. His other successes came in the 1790 race on Rhadamanthus for Lord Grosvenor and the 1807 race, when in his fifties, on Election for Lord Egremont. The extent of the Arnulls' reputation was such that \\"Newmarket [the home of British racing] without an Arnull would ... have seemed strange\\".

Digital Green is an independent non-governmental organization that focuses on training farmers to make and show short videos where they record their problems, share solutions and highlight success stories. It was first conceived as a project in Microsoft Research India's Technology for Emerging Markets in 2006 by Rikin Gandhi and his colleagues. It later branched out as an independent NGO in 2008. Digital Green's approach is primarily a technology-enabled means of behavior change communication, which is cost-effective, scalable, and brings together researchers, development practitioners, and rural communities to produce and share locally relevant information through videos. In a controlled evaluation, on a cost per adoption basis, Digital Green was shown to be at least 10 times more effective, per dollar spent, than a conventional extension system. Digital Green works across seven states in India, parts of Ethiopia, Ghana and Afghanistan. The organization engages over 150,000 farmers (over 70% women) in more than 2,000 villages. It received an Rs 3 crore Global Impact Award from Google in 2013, and Manthan award in 2012. Rikin Gandhi, the Chief Executive Officer of Digital Green, was awarded IFA Norman Borlaug Award by the International Fertilizer Industry Association in 2012.  Loop  With time, it was found that smallholder farmers in rural India spend anywhere from a half to a full day selling their produce at the nearest market while also incurring transport costs. To reduce costs, Digital Green created Loop, a mobile app based intervention that improves farmers‚Äô access to markets by helping them to aggregate their perishable produce through a local village level entrepreneur trained to use the app and aggregate - himself a farmer. Digital Green nurtures these village-level entrepreneurs to recruit farmers, assess daily produce volumes, determine which nearby market offers the best price, arrange transport based on volume, and sell farmers‚Äô produce directly to wholesale buyers. They record volumes and sales on the Loop mobile app, which sends receipts to farmers via text messages. After completing transactions on behalf of all farmers, the entrepreneurs return to the villages to deliver same-day payment and earn their commission.  Wonder Village and Farmer Book  Digital Green has developed two social online games, Wonder Village and Farmer Book. Through these games, players set up a simulated village economy and have opportunities to relate with the actual farmers that the organization works with in the field. Players are placed in a resource-constrained setting and pursue quests like setting up small farms of paddy and maize and supplying raw materials to farmers' markets. The game follows a so-called \\"freemium\\" model which allows users to play for free and allows users to purchase virtual currency to advance more quickly.

Angevin union  United kingdoms of Poland and Hungary (red) under Louis I The first union came about when the last Piast king of Poland, Casimir III, designated his sororal nephew, the Angevin king Louis I of Hungary, as his heir presumptive by the Privilege of Buda. Upon the death of Casimir, who left no legitimate sons, Louis ascended the Polish throne virtually unopposed. The Polish nobility welcomed his accession, rightly believing that Louis would be an absentee king who would not take much interest in Polish affairs. He sent his mother Elizabeth, sister of Casimir III, to govern Poland as regent. Louis probably considered himself first and foremost king of Hungary; he visited his northern kingdom three times and spent there a couple of months altogether. Negotiations with the Polish nobility frequently took place in Hungary. Hungarians themselves were unpopular in Poland, as was the king's Polish mother who governed the kingdom. In 1376, circa 160 Hungarians in her retinue were massacred in Krak√≥w and the queen returned to Hungary disgraced. Louis replaced her with their relative, Vladislaus II of Opole. During Romanticism, Hungarian historians portrayed the union as an annexation of Poland into Hungary. In 1845, S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi wrote that \\"the falling stars of the north, the east and the south were all extinguished in Hungarian seas\\". In reality, Poland's independence remained largely uncompromised. King Louis saw to it that Hungarian influence in Poland was not greater than Polish influence in Hungary. The union fell apart after Louis died in 1382. The dissatisfied Polish szlachta demanded that his successor in Hungary, Mary, move to Krak√≥w and reign over Hungary and Poland from there. Mary's mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia (widow of Louis and grandniece of Casimir III's father, Vladislaus I), knew that the lack of supporters would render her influence at least as restricted as that of her mother-in-law and refused to move. She abandoned the idea of attempting to subdue the Polish nobility by force and agreed to send her younger surviving daughter, Hedwig, to be crowned as Louis' successor in Poland. The union had lasted little more than a decade and ended as peacefully as it had started.  Jagiellonian union  By the end of the century, Louis had no descendants. Both Mary and Hedwig had died, the former heavily pregnant and the latter soon after giving birth to a short-lived daughter. In 1440, Vladislaus III of Poland, son of Hedwig's widower and successor Jogaila, was elected king of Hungary. The election was fiercely disputed by Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Mary's widower and successor Sigismund. A two-year civil war ensued, ending upon Elizabeth's death in 1442. Vladislaus' own death in battle in 1444 ended the union.

Yapko (born August 5, 1954) is a clinical psychologist and author, whose work is focused in the areas of treating depression, developing brief psychotherapies and advancing the clinical applications of hypnosis. Education and professional career Yapko attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned a B.A. in Psychology in 1976, before attending United States International University in San Diego for graduate studies, earning an M.A. in Psychology in 1978, and his Ph.D. in Professional Psychology, Clinical Specialization in 1980. He is licensed in California as both a psychologist and marriage and family therapist. He opened a private practice in 1979, which he maintained until retiring from clinical practice in 2007 to focus on writing and teaching. He now regularly conducts clinical trainings in the areas of treating depression, psychotherapy, and applying clinical hypnosis. In addition to his private practice, he served as the director of The Milton H. Erickson Institute of San Diego. A non-profit organization for the study of psychotherapy, it is focused on training health and mental health professionals through conferences and workshops. He was also a founding member of the editorial board for The Ericksonian Monographs, a journal on Ericksonian hypnosis and psychotherapy. During the 1980s, Yapko was a member of the faculty at the National University, San Diego, as well as a faculty member at United States International University, San Diego. From 2001 to 2004, he wrote the \\"Managing Your Mood\\" column for Psychology Today. He is currently a member of the board of advisory editors for the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. He also serves as an editorial consultant for the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis. Treating depression with clinical hypnosis A proponent of Ericksonian techniques, Yapko employs hypnosis and other non-drug-based therapies in the treatment of depression. In his books and articles, he presents the view that the depression is a multidimensional disorder with multiple causal factors, including biological, psychological and social influences. As a result, he feels that patients respond better to psychotherapy in many cases, and that while the use of antidepressants may be called for in some cases, they are often overutilized with too little being known about their efficiency or long- term effects. Repressed memory controversy In the 1990s, Yapko generated some controversy among mental health professionals for saying that many therapists use inappropriately suggestive techniques to help patients recall repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse, memories that are sometimes suggested by the therapists themselves. In a survey he conducted of nearly 1,000 professional therapists, he reported that almost 19 percent of those surveyed said they knew of cases where they believed that a patient's trauma had been suggested by their psychotherapist, rather than based on a genuine experience. Moreover, for Yapko, the absence of technique-specific training of the therapists was a matter of considerable concern: less than 45% of those using hypnosis had received formal training in clinical hypnosis. Yapko's 1994 book Suggestions of Abuse: True and False Memories of Childhood Sexual Trauma directly addressed the issue, explaining that some therapists use inappropriate techniques, including checklists of symptoms such as depression, low self-esteem, headaches, obesity, arthritis and acne, to diagnose sexual abuse that never actually occurred. One critic, Lenore Terr, a San Francisco psychiatrist and author of Unchained Memories, stated in an interview that she felt that Yapko \\"overstates the problem\\" but she admitted that \\"it sometimes happens\\". Two legal scholars noted that Yapko was careful to distinguish between (1) cases in which someone knows all along that he or she was abused, (2) cases in which someone independently remembers repressed memories, (3) cases in which a therapist facilitates recall of genuinely repressed memories, and (4) cases in which a therapist suggests memories of abuse; the scholars noted: \\"Unfortunately, many who share Yapko's concern about improper suggestion fail to heed his caution about reserving judgment until cases are examined on their facts.\\" Affiliations and awards Yapko is a member of the American Psychological Association, and a clinical member of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. He is also a member of the International Society of Hypnosis, and a fellow of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. He is a three-time winner of the Arthur Shapiro Award for the best book of the year on hypnosis from the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, winning it first in 2001 for Treating Depression with Hypnosis, then in 2006 for Hypnosis and Treating Depression, and again in 2012 for Mindfulness and Hypnosis.

Censorship under the dictatorship of former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was replaced with unprecedented freedom of expression and questions on how to use it. The newfound vigorousness of the arts in Tunisia and the new challenges artists have to address echo those in other countries affected by the Arab Spring, especially Egypt. Background Art before the Tunisian revolution Artists found ways to circumvent or avoid censorship of their work before the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime. Tunisian collaborative painting, for instance, is an art form created in Tunisia during the 1980s that allows several artists to collaborate on one piece without prior discussion or planning. Although the Tunisian art market was relatively small and inward looking compared to the ones in other North African countries like Morocco or Algeria, there was proof of an evolving, dynamic art scene even before the revolution, with the successes of Galerie El Marsa or Le Violon Bleu. Still, according to Khadija Hamdi: \\"In Tunisia, with the absence, among other things, of a cultural policy specific to the art market, and the lack of the appropriate cultural and ideological conditions, the emergence of a \\"system\\" of \\"contemporary art\\" itself (in the Western sense) has not yet been possible.\\" Certain artistic institutions such as the school of music in El Kef were closed by the regime as potential hotbeds of discord. Art during and after the Tunisian revolution Works of art that used the revolution as a subject proliferated after the downfall of the former regime, both to emulate iconic revolutionary symbols and to explore the complex challenges the country still faced. The revolution saw an upshot in the number of artistic manifestations such as exhibits, most notably in the field of photography. Other art forms such as music also thrived after the revolution. Remnants from the older regime and from the demonstrations themselves were also used by artists during the revolution, by transforming a police station into an art gallery or transforming burnt out cars into works of art, for instance. Villas belonging to the Trabelsis, the family of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's wife Le√Øla Ben Ali, became the target of graffiti artists soon after the regime's downfall. =Street art= In the months during and following the revolution, street art played a major role by reclaiming public spaces that used to be controlled by the government and by letting artists and ordinary citizens express themselves freely for the first time in years. Individual artists or groups like the student-run Ahl El Kahf collective used stencils, graffitis and paintings to depict political or revolutionary themes, such as the portrait of Mohamed Bouazizi. In addition to using local revolutionary symbols, street artists also reused Western and Latin American revolutionary icons in the work. Murals were one of the most common form of street art, representing, for instance, people killed during the revolution. According to Nicholas Korody, \\"The graffiti of the Tunisian revolution always possesses a revolutionary character in form. That is to say, it existed as a reappropriation of authoritarian-controlled property. It is also notable in that it is the only art form born out of the revolution. While a few artists existed in Tunisia during the Ben Ali regime, their work was quickly covered up and few people knew about the art form. Since the revolution, it has grown massively.\\" Academic Response The revolution in Tunisia and its aftermath has prompted much discussion. Tunisian intellectual, Dr. Mohamed-Salah Omri, a fellow at University of Oxford in Modern Arabic literature, has dedicated much of his research to examining the intersections between poetry and revolution, the \\"Confluency\\" between Culture, Revolution and Trade Unionism in Tunisia, and the overall challenges of the democratic transition in the country. New challenges Religious challenges to artistic freedom Despite the end of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's dictatorship, Tunisian artists have faced new challenges to their artistic freedom, often from groups that have a strict interpretation of Islam. After years of censorship and repression of both the art world and religious identity, the new regime has had to juggle between the two, and tensions have periodically surfaced. In June 2012 riots erupted against the \\"Printemps des Arts\\" exhibit in La Marsa that Salafi groups and others deemed blasphemous, most notably because of one work of art that spelled out God's name using insects. Hundreds were arrested and curfews were imposed. Some radical religious leaders called for the deaths of the artists, who received death threats, and Tunisian minister of culture Mehdi Mabrouk condemned the artists by saying that art should be \\"beautiful,\\" not \\"revolutionary,\\" and that the artists were wrong to invoke Islamic imagery. The leader of the ruling Ennahda Movement, Rachid Ghannouchi, said that he condemned violence against individuals or property but also opposed \\"attacks on the beliefs of Tunisians\\" and emphasized the need to protect \\"sacred symbols\\". Also deemed blasphemous by some was a work of art by Nadia Jelassi, who created an installation of female mannequin busts, cloaked in hijabs and surrounded by stones. Jelassi, a teacher at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, was called to appear before a judge and was charged for disturbing public order. Her treatment - police took her fingerprints and a mugshot - sparked an online campaign in defense of free expression. In the aftermath of the incident, the artistic community complained that authorities weren't doing enough to protect them. Religious hardliners tried and sometimes succeeded to prevent other artistic events from taking place like music festivals and plays. Women artists in particular feared that hardline Muslim pressure would prevent them from working freely. These tensions led many to feel that \\"nothing had changed\\" with regards to the relations between art and politics, as censorship is said to have shifted from being political to being religious and moral. According to Sofiane Ouissi, co-creative director of the Dream City, an art festival that takes place in Tunis' medina: \\"Under the old censorship and oppression - it was conspicuous; we could locate it; it was clear for us. [...] But now, since it was displaced, it has come into the public space, you never know where dictatorship is going to emerge.\\" Political challenges to artistic freedom Artists have also been targeted by the new regime. In November 2012, Chahine Berriche and Oussama Bouagila, two Tunisian graffiti artists, were arrested for writing \\"the people want rights for the poor\\" and \\"the poor are the living-dead in Tunisia\\" on the wall of a university. The two artists were members of the Zwelwa art activist collective and were charged with breaching the state of emergency, writing on public property and disturbing public order. Attempts to address challenges Tunisian street artists eL Seed reacted to these tensions between the artistic and religious communities by painting verses of the Quran preaching tolerance onto the Jara mosque in his hometown of Gab√®s. He also said that the threat of censorship was exaggerated in certain circles: \\"I feel that there is a lot of hypocrisy in Tunisia at the moment, and unfortunately many artists relish censorship, or the fear of it, if it brings them international recognition. I personally have not felt any real threats of censorship.\\" New art institutions and organizations The B‚Äôchira Art Center, located near Sidi Thabet between Tunis and Bizerte, opened in July 2011. The center aimed to develop contemporary art by providing a space for artists to produce and show work, as well as an experimental laboratory to research techniques and introduce children to the art world. The Carthage National Museum saw the launch of an umbrella program called Carthage Contemporary, part of an increasingly dynamic contemporary art scene in Tunisia. Also established after the revolution in 2011 was the Tunisian Federation of the Visual Arts (F√©d√©ration Tunisienne des Arts Plastiques), a grouping of young artist associations aimed at defending and promoting visual arts in Tunisia. These goals are shared by two preexisting organizations, the Association of Tunisian Visual Artists (Union des Artistes Plasticiens Tunisiens) and the Union of Visual Arts Professions (Syndicat des M√©tiers des Arts Plastiques), created in 2009. International influences and projects In Tunisia French street artist and photographer JR launched the first phase of his Inside Out Project in Tunisia, where native photographers displayed large scale portraits of ordinary Tunisians around the country instead of the formerly ubiquitous pictures of the president. The project fostered discussion with Tunisians, some of whom understood and appreciated the project, while others did not think art should play a political role by using public spaces and complained that the previous regime already imposed pictures upon them all the time. Algerian-French artist ZOO Project also celebrated the revolution by placing hundreds of life-size figures around the city, representing the Tunisians who revolted and in particular those who died during the revolution. Abroad Tunisian artists also explored political and revolutionary themes in exhibits abroad. In France, the Institut du Monde Arabe hosted two events. In May 2011, an exhibit called \\"D√©gage\\" (French for \\"get lost\\") showcased photographs of the revolution by a Tunisian photography collective of the same name. A second exhibit that ran from January to April 2012 called \\"D√©gagements ‚Äì Tunisia One Year On\\" showed work from Tunisian artists and others from the Middle East to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution. It included paintings, graffiti, pictures and sculptures by artists like cartoonist Nadia Kiari and photographer Hichem Driss. In the United States, Tunisian student Ikram Lakhdhar curated an exhibit at Connecticut College called \\"Moments of Freedom: Revolutionary Art from China, South Africa and Tunisia\\" in April 2013 with work by contemporary Tunisian photographers Wassim Grimen, Omar Sfayhi, and Youssef Ben Ammar and internationally renown artists such as Diane Victor, Zhang Hongtu, Rajaa Gharbi and William Kentridge. In Germany, the ifa Gallery in Stuttgart hosted an exhibit from January to March 2013 called \\"Rosy Future\\" on the future of contemporary art in Tunisia after the revolution.

One of his most known works is Nachtg√§ngers Logik ‚Äì Journal einer Odyssee (Suhrkamp 2003), a written statement of his struggle against a severe depression. It is the first work of his literary comeback after 28 years, again by the same German publishing house as his debut work Lagebericht (Suhrkamp 1975).  Life  Adrian Naef grew up the youngest of three brothers in rural Wallisellen in the Z√ºrcher Oberland. He has a daughter with two children, and divides his time between a house shared with students and musicians in Z√ºrich and his mountain home in the canton of Ticino. After elementary school he attended commercial school in Z√ºrich. Thereafter, he studied economics in St. Gallen and Z√ºrich, before changing to philosophy where he studied to teach artistic disciplines, among others as a religious education teacher at the catechetical seminar at the University of Z√ºrich. His religious teaching was confessionally independent and open to pupils of all religions. An agnostic religious teacher was unfamiliar in the society of the eighties and caused a great stir. His teaching was based on the philosophy that nobody can get around the question of being ‚Äì and as a consequence everybody is intrinsically religious, however he suggests people neither need a god nor faith to follow a religious life. This opinion is the basis of three religious pedagogic books, the most well known of which is Gott ist krank, sein Sohn h√∂rt Punk (Zytglogge 1981). During his studies he lived in various flat-sharing communities in Switzerland and abroad, including one of the first occupied houses at the Central station in Z√ºrich, where the Protests of 1968 broke out.Tagesanzeiger: October 15, 2011. Extensive artistic activities including painting and photographing lead to exhibitions which filled his active time as a student outside the auditorium. He was an active participant of the student protests. His activities ‚Äì partly in the creative underground ‚Äì had a touch of dadaism, infiltrating right as well as left tenets with nonsense to break each down to the excessively human. His first book of poems Lagebericht, was published at Suhrkamp in 1975. The legendary publisher Siegfried Unseld introduced him as a coming talent into the intellectual circles of Frankfurt and encouraged him to start a career as a writer. However, Naef already ended his literary production and turned to the songwriter and rock scene.Tagesanzeiger: October 15, 2011. His disc Riite R√∂ssli was released 1978 and the songs were emitted in the radio as well as in the television. After the closing of the autonomous youth club AJZ, Naef founded and carried on, from 1981 to 1985, a new youth club, called Sch√ºlerfoyer, which offered a forum and a home to kids. This also served as a base of rebellious activities such as the pirate transmitter Handradio and the glueing of the wall journal Bulletin during the night. Both projects gained cult status in the stirred town. The youth club was taken over by the city and carried on. As an independent journalist he wrote for the magazine of the Tagesanzeiger. With other musicians Naef founded 1981 the Niederdorf-Rock- Ensemble, a dadaist rock cabaret that commented regularly the current events. Religious pedagogic books followed in a short sequence, whereby the title Gott ist krank, sein Sohn h√∂rt Punk was at first self-published. Due to the great success this title was relaunched by the Zytglogge publishing house, Religion ohne Gott und Teufel followed by the same publisher. Further Naef played in several Swiss film productions, among others in Deshima (direction: Beat Kuert, Japan 1987) and in Rotlicht! (directed by Urs Odermatt, 1986). After a training as a respiratory and body therapist attended by Burkhardt Kiegeland in Salzburg, Naef worked, From 1988 to 1997, as a therapeutic pediatrist at the Z√ºrich children's hospital. There he also organized clinic holiday camps and weekends with children with chronic diseases and their families. This work was abruptly interrupted in autumn 1997 with the fall into a heavy depression. After his three years ongoing illness he began a training as photograph editor at the media education centre MAZ in Lucerne. After that, he worked at the beginning as archivist and then as photograph editor at the Keystone agency in Z√ºrich. His depression experience was the main cause of the new creative phase of the author after a break of nearly thirty years: Nachtg√§ngers Logik was the first book coming out after this inside exploration period. Thereafter, several prosaic, lyrical and books of essays followed.

The Myrtle Creek Consolidated Hydraulic Gold Mining and Manufacturing Company began purchasing land for the ditch in 1890 and was bankrupt by 1894. Portions of the ditch, which carried water from Little River to North Myrtle Creek, remain visible, and an section is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Bureau of Land Management maintains a driving loop and hiking trail for touring the ditch and its works.  History  Many of the homesteaders in the area had been drawn west in the California gold rush and later moved north to begin farming. When gold was discovered in Douglas County, Oregon, in the 1860s, a number of residents returned to mining. In 1889, miners in the area began planning for of new placers around North Myrtle Creek and became convinced that the surrounding hillsides also held significant deposits. By 1890, two large hydraulic mining machines, or \\"giants\\", were operating in the area. These machines used high pressure jets of water to dislodge sediments, but were only functional for about three months each winter, when sufficient water was available.  Survey and construction  To expand the machines' usefulness, the Myrtle Creek Consolidated Hydraulic Gold Mining and Manufacturing Company proposed digging a ditch-- deep, and wide at the bottom, and five feet wide at the top--to carry water from the Little River to North Myrtle Creek. After surveyors employed by the company determined that the project was feasible, 80 men began construction, and by early winter they had completed of the ditch. The company's president, L. W. Brown, a Eugene physician, said the ditch would eventually provide irrigation water to prune orchards in the region and would transport timber to a sawmill in Myrtle Creek, in addition to supplying water for mining. In June 1891, the company hired 100 Chinese laborers to extend the ditch and tap four additional creeks, giving the construction its name. As part of this work, a tunnel was constructed through the mountain to connect the new supplies to the existing ditch. This additional construction allowed three giants to operate around the clock by the end of that year. By the time of late spring of 1892, there were still of the ditch to construct. To aid in the process, timber was produced temporarily and water was directed around the rocky hillsides. A fourth giant later made its appearance in April 1893.  Debts and dissolution  On June 1, 1893, the glory days of the company began to come to an end when the county Circuit Court issued a writ of attachment against it. In the following days, other parties were granted writs totaling $4,420 in unpaid wages and $6,000 in other debts. An injunction was issued against the sale of the property or company stock by the ownership, and the county sheriff was ordered to guard the property until the cases could be resolved. Sheriff Dillard decided that it was better to clean out the gravel in the sluices rather than guard the property around the clock. He found just over of gold, instead of the expected, based on the number of days that the giants had been operating. The company was accused of salting the placers and of hiring more men than necessary for appearances. On July 4, 1893, the court ruled for the miners, causing the company to shut down. On October 19, 1894, the company's property, mining claims, and the ditch were sold for $7,691. The China Ditch was officially entered into the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1991.

(Chile is highlighted in dark green. Chilean Antarctic Territory - claim, in light green) Ena von Baer during Hanukkah in La Moneda Palace, Santiago. The history of the Jews in Chile dates back to the arrival of Europeans to the country. Over time, Chile has received several contingents of Jewish immigrants. Currently, the Jewish community in Chile comes mainly from the migrations occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, mostly of Ashkenazi background. Chile is home to the third-largest Jewish community in South America. Chile has an estimated 18,300 Jews, according to the American Jewish Yearbook 2019 , representing 0.1% of the total Chilean population. The total amount of Chileans with Jewish ancestry, however, is roughly 30,000 (defined as people having at least one Jewish parent or grandparent, and any spouse of such person) .  Migration history   Spanish colonization and settlement  The first Jews arrived in Chile with the Spanish conquistadors. These were Jewish converts to Catholicism because, at the time of the Inquisition, they had to hide their Jewish origin. Most of this immigration occurred in the early years of the conquest, fleeing religious persecution in Spain, since in the Americas is not yet the court of the Inquisition installed.Memoria Chilena - La comunidad jud√≠a en Chile Diego Garc√≠a de C√°ceres, faithful friend and executor of the founder of Santiago, Pedro de Valdivia, was one of them. In colonial times, the most prominent Jewish character in Chile was the surgeon Francisco Maldonado da Silva, one of the first directors of the San Juan de Dios Hospital . Maldonado da Silva was an Argentine Jew born in San Miguel de Tucum√°n into a Sephardic family from Portugal. He was accused to the Tribunal of the Inquisition by her sisters, devout Christians, from attempting to convert them to Judaism. Maldonado declared openly Jew, and was sentenced to be burned alive in 1639. During this period, entire crypto-people families, those who \\"converted\\" to Catholicism but privately remained Jews, arrived. As is the case in the rest of Latin America, these original Jewish settlers did retain their identity over the generations, having assimilated into the broader majority-Catholic society of Chile . As such, the Jewish community of Chile today only really begins with the Jewish immigrations of the 19th century.  Jewish immigration in the 19th century  From 1840, decades after the abolition of the Inquisition in Chile, began the Jewish immigration to the country. The first Jews who arrived in Valpara√≠so were from Europe, especially from Germany and France. One of them, Manuel de Lima y Sola, was a man who became one of the founding members of the Fire Department of Valpara√≠so in 1851 and one of the founders of the Chilean freemasonry to create the first Masonic lodge, the \\"Uni√≥n Fraternal\\" two years later.  Jewish emigration in the 20th century  In the turbulent Pinochet era in the 1970s and 80s, many Jews left Chile. While in 1961, the Jewish population was about 30,000, by 1997 the population had dwindled to 15,000. The 2012 Chilean census showed 16,294 Jews living in the country, marking an 8.8% increase from the decade before.  Community institutions  Orthodox Judaism reaches approximately ten percent of Chile's Jewish community.Caro, Isaac. \\"Orthodoxies, dissidence and new identities in Argentine and Chilean Judaism.\\" Cuadernos Judaicos 25 (2008).

In 1652, a new group that migrated under the leadership of Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham came to Suriname Francis, Lord Willoughby and settled in the Jodensavanne area. A third group came 1664, after their expulsion from Recife and then French Guiana, led by David Cohen Nassy. According to the Encyclopedia of Latin America, \\"Suriname was one of the most important centers of the Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, and Jews there were planters and slaveholders.\\"Encyclopedia of Latin America: Amerindians through The Age of Globalization (Prehistory to the Present). J. Michael Francis, Facts On File. New York, N.Y. 2010, p. 296, Neveh Shalom Synagogue (right) The plantation economy of the Jodensavanne‚Äîan area of savannah that was settled and planted with sugarcane‚Äîrelied on slave labour. The community declined in the wake of the French Cassard expedition in 1712 and the levies he instituted, competition from beet sugar, and attacks by Maroons -slaves which had managed to escape from the plantations into the jungle, integrated with local Native American tribes, and now raided the holdings of their former masters as free men. The Jews eventually relocated to the capital of Paramaribo, but they would return to the synagogue in the Jodensavanne to celebrate the holidays until 10 September 1832, when a fire destroyed the village and synagogue. The savanna area was subsequently overtaken with jungle regrowth. History Jews in Suriname were initially split into the more populous Sephardim concentrated in the Jewish Savanna, and the much later arriving and less numerous Ashkenazim at the Neve Salom synagogue (the only still functioning synagogue). After the plantation economy failed and the Jewish Savanna depopulated, most inhabitants moved to Paramaribo, here the white Jews found it increasingly difficult not to integrate with other ethnic groups of the country, despite periodic attempts from Jewish leaders in the Netherlands to keep them in line -many simply intermarried with other ethnicities in the 19th century. in 1825 Jewish people in Suriname were given equal rights, this also caused them to loose their privileges which allowed them to police their own community. Also the two original Jewish groups began to blur together by the 18th century, even sharing a synagogue for a while. The two groups officially fused in 1999. In 2004 the last remaining synagogue decided to switch from Orthodox Judaism to Progressive Judaism. Although today the term Creole (as used in the context of Suriname) is the word used locally for 'Afro-Surinamese' (people or culture), its original meaning carried a negative connotation to mean that a white European person had forgotten how to be a \\"good Jew\\" (or proper Englishman, etc.) due to having adopted some characteristics that European communities considered \\"native\\". Especially Sephardic Jewish men 'interacted' with the black slaves on their plantations, and the usually illegitimate children with African women were raised as Jews and given Jewish names. By the 18th century this black and coloured population had grown considerably. Black and coloured Jews were not considered 'real' Jews by the white Jews, the first rules which formally classified these 'mulatos' as not being jechidim were formulated by the Beracha Ve Shalom synagogue in 1754. Coloured Jews were allowed inside the synagogues, but were not allowed to participate in any of the rituals, and had to sit on special pews which were lower than the others. Eventually the coloured Jews formed their own synagogue: Darje Jesariem or Darhe Jesarim in 1791, although the white Jews considered this legally more of a fraternity -it only lasted until 1794. The building has long been destroyed (in 1804), but in its place is a city square known as Sivaplein, siva meaning 'fraternity' in the language of the Portuguese Jews. In 1841 black and coloured Jews were given equal religious rights in Suriname.Jewish Sanctuary in the Atlantic World: A Social and Architectural History by Barry L. Stiefel Some Jewish family names have endured and are now considered Afro-Surinamese family names and the names of the Saramaka clan of Maroons refer to the Jewish plantation owners their ancestors escaped from. In the cemeteries of Paramaribo Jewish tombstones appear alongside creole ones.Vink, W., 2010. Creole Jews: negotiating community in colonial Suriname. BRILL. Identity can be used to exclude persons from a community, but it can also be used to force people to be part of community against their will. During the 17th and 18th centuries forced inclusion was commonplace in both the Portuguese and High German Jewish communities and the rigid identity boundaries were often supported by legislation. Though the cultural identity of Portuguese Jews was defined as being a white colonial elite, this identity existed alongside an aggressive policy to include poor and Jews of color.  Synagogues  Three official synagogues were built in Suriname: Beracha Ve Shalom in 1685, in the Jodensavanne; Neveh Shalom Synagogue in 1719, built by Ashkenazi Jews in the new capital of Paramaribo; and Zedek ve Shalom in 1735, built by Sephardic Jews.The Surprising Discovery of Suriname‚Äôs Jewish Community by Jacob Steinberg, 2008 Kulanu  Depopulation  Most Jews left Suriname when it was granted independence in 1975 and others left during the civil war of the 1980s. About 130 Jewish community members remained in a combined Sephardic and Ashkenazic congregation at Neve Shalom (which includes community hall and mikveh). The second synagogue was rented for use as a computer service shop, its furniture and art loaned to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. In the 1990s, the jungle growth in the Jodensavanne was cleared, 450 graves uncovered and the ruins of the synagogue maintained. In a 21st-century census, 181 entered \\"Judaism\\" as their religion, out of a total population of 560,000.

Traditionally, A number of healthcare science disciplines (such as Biomedical Scientists) had protected titles - which means they were required by law to be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council to use particular professional job titles. The introduction of a new education and training structure under Modernising Scientific Careers has required the development of a common approach to regulation and registration across the disciplines and career levels that takes account of the different legal requirements across the various healthcare science roles.

Unit fractions were known in Indian mathematics in the Vedic period: the ≈öulba S≈´tras give an approximation of equivalent to 1 + \\\\tfrac13 + \\\\tfrac1{3\\\\cdot4} - \\\\tfrac1{3\\\\cdot4\\\\cdot34}. Systematic rules for expressing a fraction as the sum of unit fractions had previously been given in the Ga·πáita-sƒÅra-sa·πÖgraha of MahƒÅvƒ´ra (). NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa's Ga·πáita-kaumudi gave a few more rules: the section bhƒÅgajƒÅti in the twelfth chapter named a·πÉ≈õƒÅvatƒÅra-vyavahƒÅra contains eight rules. The first few are: * Rule 1. To express 1 as a sum of n unit fractions: :: 1 = \\\\frac1{1\\\\cdot 2} + \\\\frac1{2 \\\\cdot 3} + \\\\frac1{3 \\\\cdot 4} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac1{(n-1)\\\\cdot n} + \\\\frac1n * Rule 2. To express 1 as a sum of n unit fractions: :: 1 = \\\\frac12 + \\\\frac13 + \\\\frac1{3^2} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac1{3^{n-2}} + \\\\frac1{2 \\\\cdot 3^{n-2}} * Rule 3. To express a fraction p/q as a sum of unit fractions: : Pick an arbitrary number i such that (q+i)/p is an integer r, write :: \\\\frac{p}{q} = \\\\frac1r + \\\\frac{i}{qr} : and find successive denominators in the same way by operating on the new fraction. If i is always chosen to be the smallest such integer, this is equivalent to the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, but the Ga·πáita-Kaumudƒ´'s rule does not give a unique procedure, and instead states evam i·π£·π≠ava≈õƒÅd bahudhƒÅ (\\"Thus there are many ways, according to one's choices.\\") * Rule 4. Given n arbitrary numbers k_1, k_2, \\\\dots, k_n, :: 1 = \\\\frac{(k_2 - k_1)k_1}{k_2 \\\\cdot k_1} + \\\\frac{(k_3 - k_2)k_1}{k_3 \\\\cdot k_2} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac{(k_n - k_{n-1})k_1}{k_n \\\\cdot k_{n-1}} + \\\\frac{1 \\\\cdot k_1}{k_n} * Rule 5. To express 1 as the sum of fractions with given numerators a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n: : Calculate i_1, i_2, \\\\dots, i_n as i_1 = a_1 + 1, i_2 = a_2 + i_1, i_3 = a_3 + i_2, and so on, and write :: 1 = \\\\frac{a_1}{1\\\\cdot i_1} + \\\\frac{a_2}{i_1 \\\\cdot i_2} + \\\\frac{a_3}{i_2 \\\\cdot i_3} + \\\\dots + \\\\frac{a_n}{i_{n-1} \\\\cdot i_n} + \\\\frac{1}{i_n}  13.

Narayana Pandita noted the equivalence of the figurate numbers and the formulae for the number of combinations of different things taken so many at a time. The book contains a rule to determine the number of permutations of n objects and a classical algorithm for finding the next permutation in lexicographic ordering though computational methods have advanced well beyond that ancient algorithm. Donald Knuth describes many algorithms dedicated to efficient permutation generation and discuss their history in his book The Art of Computer Programming.  14.

A locomotive shunting at sidings disappeared into the ground after a large, deep hole opened up beneath it. The train was never recovered and still lies buried beneath the railway, though the depth remains a source of speculation. The story East of Lindal station on the Barrow-Carnforth route, the two main lines and two goods lines ran along an embankment, with five sidings to the north. The 7am Barrow- Carnforth goods had stopped at the sidings behind Furness Railway locomotive No.115, a D1 class 0-6-0 built by the firm of Sharp Stewart between 1866 and 1885. The ‚ÄòSharpie‚Äô (as the class were nicknamed) was busy shunting when the driver, Thomas Postlethwaite, saw cracks opening up in the ground right below. Knocking off steam, he jumped for his life, no sooner clear than the earth opened up to expose a sheer-sided hole across and similar in depth. The driver and his fireman stared in disbelief as their locomotive fell into it front first, the funnel and front part embedded, with only the tender remaining visible above the surface. The rails on which the engine had been standing were snapped off and went down with it, while the supporting baulks under the main lines were laid bare. The adjacent up passenger line was left hanging lopsidedly, its ballast having cascaded into the abyss. Rescue attempts Breakdown gangs from the locomotive and Permanent way departments attended with a crane and tool vans. The tender was uncoupled and pulled clear, but the locomotive itself weighed 35 tons and getting it out would be a massive task. The hole had appeared just 45 minutes before a Barrow-Carnforth passenger was due, and rumours soon went round that a whole passenger train had been swallowed up and scores of people had been killed and injured. People flocked to look, but were kept from going too close by railway staff and police. At 2:30 PM, the men took a break for refreshments and had not been clear long when the hole suddenly deepened to about 60 feet ‚Äì the locomotive falling further still until the earth closed over it and eclipsed it from sight. Witnesses were awestruck to see the huge machine disappear so quickly from their sight, falling to an unknown depth and beyond recovery. The hole was even wider by then, with all eight tracks now twisted and bent, the ballast having fallen away, the sidings over which they had been able to take empty coaches was now unsafe to use. Passengers on the 2.57 from Carnforth were forced to abandon the train and had to walk down the adjacent road to Lindal Station, where another train took them on to Barrow. Thirteen conveyances were chartered, including large brakes, buses and horse-drawn carts for their luggage. Trainloads of ballast continued to arrive and though most thought the worst had been seen, the full extent of the subsidence could only be guessed at and no one yet knew when rails might start to be safely relaid. The uppermost level of the mine workings were down and No. 115 was considered to be lost forever. Others speculated that the train was only down. The hole eventually swallowed up around 300 wagon loads of ballast until a solid foundation was established. A Board of Trade inquiry was held under the auspices of Major-General C.S Hutchinson, veteran of numerous rail accidents including the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879. Lindal may not have been a tragedy, but was a fascinating case all the same.National Archives (Board of Trade report) Disruption Immediately after the first collapse, train passengers were forced to alight from their trains and walk around the crater to the far side. The empty carriages were then taken slowly over the dubious tracks, passengers resettling themselves once their train was back on solid ground. Passengers were eager to see the hole and crowded round to get a good look while officials tried to hurry them along. Goods and mineral traffic were a major source of revenue, so keeping them running was vital. Coke for the ironworks at Barrow, Askam and Millom, normally came via Carnforth and Lindal, but with the whole line at a standstill and Carnforth yard blocked with stalled goods trains, coke trains had to be redirected via Penrith and Whitehaven, an extra , the same route being used for livestock, perishables and goods traffic for the Belfast boats. Up Barrow to Carnforth workings were also disrupted and again redirected round the Penrith route. Great efforts were made to get southbound trains away as quickly as possible, so as not to miss connections at Carnforth. Removing all the mails from Thursday evening‚Äôs 7.45 p.m. and 9.00 p.m. from Barrow was a long-winded affair, but all the bags were transferred to the onward train, and so efficiently that it caught the Night Mail at Carnforth. Friday morning‚Äôs mail was similarly dealt with, done and dusted within an hour. Explanations The embankment was encircled by a tell-tale pattern of dips and hollows indicating a history of subsidence. Shaky ground had already caused concerns, requiring trains to be ‚Äòslowed‚Äô before crossing a nearby bridge. Extra ballasting had been necessary and the two main lines, as well as having normal crossways sleepers also rested on longitudinal baulks of timber. A field below the embankment had a hollow nearly ten feet deep, and a nearby farmhouse had been abandoned because of subsidence. There were two levels of mine workings beneath the railway. The uppermost had not been used for some time, but miners in the lower level claimed they could hear trains above their heads and had already predicted a \\"big spill\\" someday. Further subsidence Subsidence was reported again in November 1893, the line sinking by six feet very close to the 1892 subsidence. Traffic was again brought to a halt and worked single line until the problem was solved. Lancashire MP Colonel Thomas Sandys wrote to the Board of Trade with his thoughts, suggesting the mines be filled in or a bridge be built to span the unsafe ground altogether,.National Archives (ministerial correspondence) The Board of Trade kept a watch on the Furness Railway for years afterwards, though directors were worried about adverse publicity.National Archives (official Furness Railway letters) Alternative explanation The explanation for the loss of No.115 given by a contemporary paper did not involve mining subsidence: > At the point where the subsidence took place there were large fissures in > the rock, filled with sand. It is known that there is a subterranean stream > below this, and it is supposed that owing to its action there has been a > rush of sand, thus causing the subsidence effectively that the engine had not fallen into mine-workings but into a cavity caused by the collapse of an underlying sand-filled wash-hole or sink- hole of which the Furness area has many, mostly formed in the Ice Age. Where an underground water course washes out the sand it leaves a void. Heavy rainfall would accelerate removal of the fill, and heavy rainfall did precede the event: \\"[w]ith the heavy rains of late, there had been considerable flooding in the neighbourhood, and it is to this cause that the disaster is probably due.\\" At the time, the account given by The Engineer considered this possibility and identified how it might have been triggered by mining activity, but in the end thought it not the principal cause: > The railway at this point is undermined by the Parkside and Lindal Moor > Mining Company, now leased by Messrs. Harrison, Ainslie, and Co., and for > something like half a mile in length it is honeycombed by mining operations. > For some time past evidence of the mine falling in, at any rate in its upper > workings, has been seen, and on both sides of the railway embankment the > ground has been gradually slipping for some time. The railway company, > however, has been watching the action of this subsidence, and has placed a > special watchman on the spot, with a view of detecting any change. Some time > ago an adjoining farmhouse was let in, and the company found it necessary to > prop up a railway bridge to prevent the line from collapsing. It is > reported, however, that the workings of the Parkside mines have not been > interfered with by the subsidence in the embankment, and that they exist > intact under a stratification of rock which is as yet unshaken. The > inference is that the vast volume of water which is pumped from the mines > has caused percolation through the rock and left cavities in the upper > strata which have caused a subsidence; but there is reason to believe that > the subsidence which has now occurred is due mainly to the absolute fall of > earth into old workings‚Ä¶ Today No.115 is officially regarded as ‚Äòpreserved‚Äô, but recovery is a source of speculation. It may not lay as deep as long thought. Many believe that the locomotive is not far down, probably lying within the confines of the embankment. The incident has been the inspiration for \\"Down the Mine\\", one of the Rev. W. Awdry's railway series published in 1953, though that story may equally have been inspired by a similar incident in April 1945 where an industrial locomotive, still with its driver on board, fell into a disused mine shaft.Wigan World In popular culture The event provided the inspiration for the Arthur Conan Doyle story, \\"The Lost Special\\", and, directly and indirectly, the TV serial Lost. The third story in the eighth book of The Railway Series by Wilbert Awdry and its television adaptation in Thomas & Friends were inspired by the incident.

Ltd Bank Archives - The University of Nottingham Dept. of Manuscripts and Special Collections was an Anglo-German merchant bank and accepting house in the early nineteenth and late twentieth century. The bank was established by the Brandts, a well established German mercantile family, from Hamburg. E. H. Brandt opened his first office in London in 1805 where his postal address was Batson's Coffee House. A branch of the firm had also been opened in Archangel, Russia in 1802. The London business prospered and as a result of growing trade with Russia, it became fully independent in 1865. Some years earlier the firm had to a large extent left the purely merchanting business and turned more to the merchant banking side by giving advances on an acceptance basis against overseas produce shipped, or be to shipped and sold through them. The firm traded exclusively with Russia (particularly in Archangel, Riga and St. Petersburg) until 1875 when it began trading in Argentine grain movements and meat refrigeration. Their Russian interests also included sugar refineries, saw mills, cordage factories, tanneries, iron foundries, cotton mills and wharfs. Several members of the family held prominent positions with Wilhelm becoming consul for the city of Hamburg and in 1832 Edmund became United States consul in Archangel. The firm was the leading shipper in Archangel between 1819 to 1850. The London arm took over the Calcutta house of Scholvin and Co. in 1886 and thereby extended its interests to India. The company had the name William Brandt's Sons and Company Limited at the time with offices at 4 Fenchurch Avenue in the City of London. Brandt had capital of 0.35 million pounds in 1880 rising to 0.75 million pounds by 1904 and one million by 1914. Brandt's was a founding member of the Accepting House Committee that was set up at the beginning of the First World War and acceptances accounted for a substantial part of its business. By 1914, acceptance liabilities in Russia accounted for less than 10 percent of Brandt's business and the largest portion of acceptance business was with the United States (almost 35 percent). They remained one of London‚Äôs leading merchant banks with a large acceptance business from 1850 to 1914. The bank is first mentioned in the London Banks directory in 1894. In that year its partners were Alfred Ernst Brandt, Arthur Henry Brandt and Augustus Ferdinand Brandt. Henry Bernhard Brandt and Augustus Philip Brandt also became partners in 1895 but Alfred had ceased to be a partner in the following year. Rudolph Ernst Brandt joined the firm in 1898, replacing Arthur. They diversified into investment managment, property and insurance in the early 1960s. In addition, the bank fully acquired Jenson Motors in 1968. Other subsidiaries included a successful timber and forest products business that was established by a Russian cousin after the revolution. Brandt's sold 1/3 of their shares to National and Grindlays Bank in 1965 who then fully acquired the remaining balance in 1972. Its most infamous former employee, John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan, resigned from a position he held with the bank. The bank remained an independent family run business for seven generations.

Within the mill site there is also a Kaplan turbine generating hydroelectricity, some of which is sold to the BillerudKorsn√§s paper mill across the river. A fish ladder bypassing the weir allows salmon to pass up the river to breed.

Description  Colonies range in length up to at least 240mm, with a symmetrical slightly tapering round-tipped cylindrical rachis and a tapering peduncle of between one fifth and one third of the total length of the colony. The rachis is covered all round with dimorphic polyps, radially arranged with respect to the longitudinal axis. Siphonozoids are packed between the bases of the retractile autozooids, which have inconspicuous non-retractile bifurcated calyces. Colour is variable and permanent; individual colonies may be entirely reddish brown, pink or mauve, yellow, white or cream, or the rachis may be purple to reddish purple, with a yellow, white, pink or brownish peduncle.The Pennatulacea of Southern Africa (Coelentrata, Anthozoa), Annals of the South African Museum Volume 99 May 1990 part 4, Cape Town.

In B√°bism A Da'ira ( circle) is a symbolic circular talisman for women described by the B√°b. For men he instructed the use of a Haykal (temple), a five-pointed star. The B√°b stated that these terms should not be interpreted too literally, and that one should focus on their spiritual meaning. The purpose was that the texts on the paper should appear in the heart of the person carrying it.Moojan Momen (2019). The Star Tablet of the Bab. British Library Blog. The Haykal is a symbol for the Manifestation of God, while the circle refers to the \\"Sun of Truth,\\" another term for the Manifestation of God.

History   Origin of name  The Matthias-Gr√ºnewald-Verlag is named after the painter and graphic artist Matthias Gr√ºnewald, who is regarded as an important German representative of the Renaissance.  History of the publishing house  The publishing house was founded in 1918 in the environment of the so-called Bible Movement and the Liturgical Movement in Mainz. A main crystallization point was the Catholic theologian Romano Guardini. Among others the series Classics of Catholic Theology and the Bible translation of Paul Riessler and Rupert Storr (Mainz Bible) appeared. In 1944 the Reichsschrifttumskammer (RSK) announced the closure of the publishing house. During the Second World War the publishing house and its archives were completely destroyed. After the war the work was continued. In 1978 the publishing house, which had been a Kommanditgesellschaft since 1938, was transformed into a GmbH. After Matthias- Gr√ºnewald-Verlag was transferred to Schwabenverlag AG on 1 January 2006, the company was suspended in 2006 and in liquidation. The successor company was MGV GmbH, which was deleted from the commercial register on 20 November 2009.Handelsregister des AG Mainz, HRB 1654 (MGV GmbH) Today Matthias Gr√ºnewald Verlag is a company of the Patmos publishing group in Schwabenverlag AG in Ostfildern (HRB 210919).

A temperature differential may be created in many ways, including solar heating, space heating devices, fire, or hot and cold liquids. Sloping glass surfaces are subject to greater solar radiation than vertical surfaces and so are more prone to solar thermal fracture. In framed window glass, the edges are relatively cooler than the exposed areas, so space heating devices in very close proximity may cause thermal fracture. Factors affecting thermal stress *Solar absorption: the temperature of glass depends on the amount of heat absorbed by the glass. So a high performance solar control glass will absorb more heat. so it will be more prone to thermal fracture *Shadow: the presence of shadows will result in relatively cooler areas in glass. Thus it results in temperature difference and may result in thermal fracture. *Edge strength: crack will form if the tensile strength of glass edge exceeds the critical point. Clean cut glass is the strongest and after that polished edge is strongest. *Artificial heating and cooling: if heating or cooling vents are present, the glass can heat or cool excessively and may result in thermal stress. *Frame type and colour: insulating materials keep the edges cool but conduction materials are influenced by their colour. dark colours are more absorptive so causes more heating. *glass type : edge strength of wired glass is less than of ordinary glasses due to weakening caused by cutting processes.Thermal Stress And ThermalFracture \\"Viridian Glass\\" Different types of thermal fracture *Low energy: Most common type of fractures. It is caused by damage to the edge of the glass. This weakens the edge, so less stress is required to cause the failure. The probability of this type of thermal fracture cannot be determined using thermal assessment processes. *High energy: These are rare and require high levels of thermal stress. The probability of this type of thermal fracture can be determined using thermal assessment processes. Prevention of thermal fracture *Low energy: edges of annealed laminated glasses are polished. Inspection is done to find damages in glass. *High energy: glasses are heat strengthened to avoid high energy thermal failure.

Other artifacts have been found from the Iron Age and Roman era tombs and coins from the 1st to 3rd centuries. The modern municipality of Cavigliano is first mentioned in 1213 as Caveliano. In 1591 it was mentioned as Caviano, Pedemonte di sopra and Terra di cima. During the Middle Ages the village was part of the Locarno and Ascona region, and it paid a tithe to the Capitanei of Locarno. During this time the villages of Cavigilano, Tegna, Verscio and Auressio formed the municipality of Pedemonte. Tegna left Pedemonte in 1464 to form an independent municipality. In the 16th Century it became part of the bailiwick of Locarno. The village evolved into an independent political municipality in 1803. The village Church of S. Michele dates from the 16th century, while the Catholic parish of Cavigliano was created in 1850. The train station in the municipality on the Locarno‚ÄìDomodossola line was built in 1923. Since the 1960s, the agrarian municipality gradually become a commuter town for the agglomeration of Locarno. The tourist and educational center of the Swiss Labor Assistance, known as Casa solidariet√†, has been in the municipality since 1946. Tegna Village church of Tegna Tegna was first mentioned in 1238 as Tenia. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are several Bronze Age graves. The remains of a wall from a La T√®ne era fortification and a later Roman era building have also been discovered. During the Middle Ages, Tegna Castle and another smaller fortress were built in the mountains above the village. Both structures are now ruins. The village church of S. Maria Assunta was first mentioned in the 14th century. At that time it was a filial church of the parish church in Verscio. S. Maria Assunta became the parish church for the Tegna parish in 1692/93. During the Middle Ages the population grew crops and raised cattle in the valley around the village. Beginning in the 16th century they began a seasonal migration for work in the Livorno area. In the beginning of the 20th century, many residents migrated to jobs building the Locarno-Domodossola railroad line and nearby hydroelectric power plants. Much of the village was destroyed in a massive flood in 1978. Verscio Aerial view of Verscio village Verscio was first mentioned in 1335 as Varzio. In 1366 it was mentioned as Vercio. Throughout its history, Verscio was the political and religious center of the Pedemonte community. The village parish church of S. Fedele was consecrated in 1214 and served as the religious center of the surrounding villages until 1692/93 for Tenga and 1850 for Cavigliano. The early church was decorated with Romanesque and Gothic frescoes. The current church tower was built in 1707 and the rest of the church was renovated in 1743-48. During the Middle Ages the population grew crops in the valley around the village. Beginning in the 16th century they began a seasonal migration for work in the Livorno area. The thin soil and limited farming land kept the village small and the population poor. In the 19th century many residents emigrated to other countries and the population dropped in Verscio. Beginning in the 1920s work in the watch industry provided about 60 jobs for residents. This remained an important part of the local economy until the 1970s when cheaper import watches damaged the Swiss watch industry. During the 1960s the city of Locarno began to expand and Verscio became a commuter town for the growing city. Today almost three-quarters of the working population commutes to jobs in Locarno. In 1971 the Teatro Dimitri was founded in the village. The Teatro was the first permanent theater in the canton. Four years later it expanded into the Scuola Teatro Dimitri (Dimitri Theater School) and in 2004 it became a full secondary school.

Early life He was born at Hasanlar village of the former Mucur district in 1913. He completed his secondary education at the Istanbul High School. He studied Mathematics at the University of Nancy in France graduating in 1937. Returned home in 1938, B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± began working as assistant to Fatin G√∂kmen at the Kandilli Observatory in Istanbul. In 1940, he took a teacher post in the Haydarpa≈üa High School, where he served until 1946. Political career Introduced to Mehmet Fuat K√∂pr√ºl√º and Celal Bayar, the co-founders of the Democrat Party (DP) by Fatin G√∂kmen, Osman B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± entered politics in 1946 becoming a party member. He was appointed Inspector General of the DP. However, he left the party in 1947 along with some other members due to a controversy over the intension of making harsh politics against the Republican People's Party (CHP). On July 20, 1948, he co-founded with Fevzi √áakmak and some others the Nation Party (MP). B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± was arrested in 1949 on allegation for conspiracy against Celal Bayar, leader of the DP, and ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, leader of the CHP. After a brieft while, he was released. B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± entered the parliament representing his hometown Kƒ±r≈üehir as the only deputy of his party following the 1950 general elections. His party was banned in 1953 on the grounds of anti-secularism politics. Osman B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± subsequently formed the Republican Nation Party (CMP) with the founders of the closed party. The new established party won five seats in the parliament at the 1954 general elections. All the five deputies were from Kƒ±r≈üehir, the hometown of B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±. The ruling Democrat Party changed the province status of Kƒ±r≈üehir to district and subordinated it to Nev≈üehir Province. Kƒ±r≈üehir remained district for the following period of three years. During this time, B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± harshly criticized the government. Kƒ±r≈üehir's province status was restored in June 1957, however, the district of his village Hasanlar and three other districts remained within Nev≈üehir Province. B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± was arrested in July 1957 on grounds of insulting the parliament. In the 1957 general elections, he secured a seat in the parliament along with other three party colleagues from the CMP. Because still imprisoned, he took the required oath of office at the Tenth Ward of the Ankara Central Proison in pajamas before the inmates. To strengthen opposition to the ruling Democratic Party, the CMP merged with the Turkey Peasants' Party (TKP) to form the Republican Peasants' Nation Party (CMKP) in 1958 under the leadership of B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±. He was sentenced to ten months in prison in 1959. Following the 1960 military coup, B√∂l√ºkba»ôƒ± participated at the Constitutional Assembly in 1961 representing the CKMP. However, he rejected in an uncompromising manner to join the coalition government after the 1961 general elections. B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± left the CKMP along with othe 28 deputies in June 1962, and re-established the National Party (MP) upon his party's joining the 2nd coalition government of ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º. He was named leader of the new party. In 1965, his party took part in the coalition government of Suat Hayri √úrg√ºpl√º. B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± did not take office in the cabinet, and also openly criticized the government. In February 1969, the general assembly of his former party CKMP approved the renaming of the party to today's Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Later years Osman B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± stepped down from the post of the Nation Party's leadership in 1972. The reason of his quitting was the conflict of opinion within the party, and also finally injustice done by party members to Hasan Ko√ßdemir, his close friend in active politics. On September 9, 1973, B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± resigned from his post as the deputy of Ankara, he was holding since 1961, and left active politics five weeks before the 1973 general elections. Osman B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± was a man of action and full of spirits, who won the sympathy of broad masses for his openness, straightforwardness, honesty, rhetoric, quick-wittedness and temperament. He was nicknamed \\"Anatolian Storm\\" ). For chatterers, the saying \\"B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± gab\\" was coined. His mass meetings during the electoral campaigns were attended by crowds, who, however, did not always vote for him. Osman B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± died of respiratory failure at the university hospital in Ankara on February 6, 2002, and was laid to rest two days later at the Cebeci Asri Cemetery following a memorial ceremony held at the parliament building and later a religious funeral service at the Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara. He was survived by his wife Mediha B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± (n√©e B√ºy√ºkyaƒücƒ±oƒülu) and his son Ahmet Deniz B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±, who is a former ambassador and former MP from the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).

Unlike traditional numerical solution methods, which approach the problem by discretizing time and solving for the next (real-valued) state at each successive time step, QSS methods keep time as a continuous entity and instead quantize the system's state, instead solving for the time at which the state deviates from its quantized value by a quantum. They can also have many advantages compared to classical algorithms. They inherently allow for modeling discontinuities in the system due to their discrete-event nature and asynchronous nature. They also allow for explicit root-finding and detection of zero-crossing using explicit algorithms, avoiding the need for iteration---a fact which is especially important in the case of stiff systems, where traditional time-stepping methods require a heavy computational penalty due to the requirement to implicitly solve for the next system state. Finally, QSS methods satisfy remarkable global stability and error bounds, described below, which are not satisfied by classical solution techniques. By their nature, QSS methods are therefore neatly modeled by the DEVS formalism, a discrete-event model of computation, in contrast with traditional methods, which form discrete-time models of the continuous-time system. They have therefore been implemented in [PowerDEVS], a simulation engine for such discrete-event systems. Theoretical properties In 2001, Ernesto Kofman proved a remarkable property of the quantized-state system simulation method: namely, that when the technique is used to solve a stable linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the global error is bounded by a constant that is proportional to the quantum, but (crucially) independent of the duration of the simulation. More specifically, for a stable multidimensional LTI system with the state-transition matrix A and input matrix B, it was shown in [CK06] that the absolute error vector \\\\vec{e}(t) is bounded above by : \\\\left \\\\vec{e}(t) \\\\right \\\\leq \\\\left V \\\\right\\\\ \\\\left \\\\Re\\\\left(\\\\Lambda\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\Lambda \\\\right\\\\ \\\\left V^{-1} \\\\right\\\\ \\\\Delta\\\\vec{Q} + \\\\left V \\\\right\\\\ \\\\left \\\\Re\\\\left(\\\\Lambda\\\\right)^{-1} V^{-1} B \\\\right\\\\ \\\\Delta\\\\vec{u} where \\\\Delta\\\\vec{Q} is the vector of state quanta, \\\\Delta\\\\vec{u} is the vector with quanta adopted in the input signals, V \\\\Lambda V^{-1} = A is the eigendecomposition or Jordan canonical form of A, and \\\\left\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,\\\\right denotes the element-wise absolute value operator (not to be confused with the determinant or norm). It is worth noticing that this remarkable error bound comes at a price: the global error for a stable LTI system is also, in a sense, bounded below by the quantum itself, at least for the first-order QSS1 method. This is because, unless the approximation happens to coincide exactly with the correct value (an event which will almost surely not happen), it will simply continue oscillating around the equilibrium, as the state is always (by definition) guaranteed to change by exactly one quantum outside of the equilibrium. Avoiding this condition would require finding a reliable technique for dynamically lowering the quantum in a manner analogous to adaptive stepsize methods in traditional discrete time simulation algorithms. First-order QSS method ‚Äì QSS1 Let an initial value problem be specified as follows. : \\\\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), t), \\\\quad x(t_0) = x_0. The first-order QSS method, known as QSS1, approximates the above system by : \\\\dot{x}(t) = f(q(t), t), \\\\quad q(t_0) = x_0. where x and q are related by a hysteretic quantization function :q(t) = \\\\begin{cases}x(t) & \\\\text{if } \\\\leftx(t) - q(t^{-})\\\\right \\\\geq \\\\Delta Q \\\\ q(t^{-}) & \\\\text{otherwise}\\\\end{cases} where \\\\Delta Q is called a quantum. Notice that this quantization function is hysteretic because it has memory: not only is its output a function of the current state x(t), but it also depends on its old value, q(t^{-}). This formulation therefore approximates the state by a piecewise constant function, q(t), that updates its value as soon as the state deviates from this approximation by one quantum. The multidimensional formulation of this system is almost the same as the single-dimensional formulation above: the k^\\\\text{th} quantized state q_k(t) is a function of its corresponding state, x_k(t), and the state vector \\\\vec{x}(t) is a function of the entire quantized state vector, \\\\vec{q}(t): :\\\\vec{x}(t) = f(\\\\vec{q}(t), t) High-order QSS methods ‚Äì QSS2 and QSS3 The second-order QSS method, QSS2, follows the same principle as QSS1, except that it defines q(t) as a piecewise linear approximation of the trajectory x(t) that updates its trajectory as soon as the two differ from each other by one quantum. The pattern continues for higher-order approximations, which define the quantized state q(t) as successively higher-order polynomial approximations of the system's state. It is important to note that, while in principle a QSS method of arbitrary order can be used to model a continuous-time system, it is seldom desirable to use methods of order higher than four, as the Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem implies that the time of the next quantization, t, cannot (in general) be explicitly solved for algebraically when the polynomial approximation is of degree greater than four, and hence must be approximated iteratively using a root-finding algorithm. In practice, QSS2 or QSS3 proves sufficient for many problems and the use of higher-order methods results in little, if any, additional benefit.

On 15 May 2011 he was beatified in W√ºrzburg Cathedral. Life Georg H√§fner came from humble origins ‚Äì his father Valentin Haefner was a municipal worker. Georg H√§fner was baptized in the cathedral parish, in 1918 he passed the exam for military school. However, his parents also allowed him to study theology and two years after beginning to do so, he joined the Third Order of Discalced Carmelites. On 13 April 1924 to Georg H√§fner was ordained a priest and held his first mass at the Kloster Himmelspforten in W√ºrzburg. This was followed by several terms as a chaplain, before he was appointed pastor of Oberschwarzach in Franconia in 1934. H√§fner refused to give the Nazi salute, which made him unpopular to the Nazi regime as chaplain of the Altglashuetten district of Wildflecken. From 1938 onwards he was banned from giving religious education at the local school in Oberschwarzach, meaning he had to hold first communion and confirmation classes in secret. Due to critical remarks against the Nazi regime in his teaching and preaching ‚Äì he is said to have referred to them, among other things, as \\"brown dung beetles\\" ‚Äì he was frequently arrested and questioned by the Gestapo. In August 1941 a seriously-ill member of the Nazi party asked H√§fner to come to give him the last rites. H√§fner came as requested, but left the party-member to sign a deathbed confession that his second civil-ceremony marriage was invalid before God and his conscience. After reading a statement in church the following Sunday that the man was to be buried in church, H√§fner was denounced by a second party member and arrested by the Gestapo. He was initially held in the Gestapo prison in W√ºrzburg. Although Vicar-General Franz Miltenberger interceded for him, H√§fner was moved to the so-called 'priest block' at Dachau on 12 December 1941 without a court-order. His prisoner number was 28876. He died there on 20 August 1942 from the effects of abuse and malnutrition. He was buried in the priests' section of W√ºrzburg's Hauptfriedhof cemetery on 18 September 1942. Beatification On 9 December 1942, in the presence of bishop Paul-Werner Scheele, H√§fner's remains were moved into the crypt of the Neum√ºnsterkirche. The episcopal survey on his beatification took place from 23 July 1992 to 31 May 2002.Pfarrer Georg H√§fner On 3 July 2009 pope Benedict XVI issued a decree stating that H√§fner was a martyr.

With some 800 employees, the agency's tasks include maritime safety, hydrographic survey, maritime pollution monitoring, and approvals of offshore installations. History The agency can be traced back to Norddeutsche Seewarte (North German Naval Observatory), founded in 1867 by Wilhelm von Freeden, which issued individual sailing directions based on nautical and meteorological observations as early as 1868. After World War II, the Deutsches Hydrographisches Institut (DHI) [German Hydrographical Institute] was founded in 1945 and took over these tasks. While it was first active throughout all four zones of Allied-occupied Germany, operations in the Soviet zone ceased when the DHI became part of the Western Allies' unified zone which was to become the state of West Germany. After the German reunification of 1990, the DHI was merged with Bundesamt f√ºr Schiffsvermessung (BAS) [Federal Agency for Tonnage Measurement] to form the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency. At the same time, the Seehydrographischer Dienst [Maritime Hydrographical Service] of East Germany which was part of the People's Navy was taken over. Tasks The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency provides maritime services for shipping, economy and marine environment. It is a federal agency within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. The various tasks include: *Facilitation of the German merchant marine, *Tonnage measurement and matter related to flags of convenience, *Issue of certificates for sailors, *Testing and approval of navigational and radio equipment, *Maritime hazard control, *Issue of official nautical charts, handbooks and other nautical publications such as notice to mariners for professional and recreational shipping, *Bathymetry of North Sea and Baltic Sea, *Calculation and forecasts of tide tables, water levels and storm tides, *Monitoring of the marine environment which includes the operation of several fixed automated stations, *Investigation of environmental pollution at sea, *Maritime spatial planning for the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Germany, *Approval of commercial offshore activities like wind farming, pipelines or submarine communications cables in the German EEZ of North Sea and Baltic. The agency is moreover represented in a number of national and international panels.

It is regarded as a matter of some importance both by art historians and the art market to establish which version has \\"priority\\", that is to say was the original work. The presumption usually is that the prime version is the finest, and perhaps the most carefully done, though some later versions can be argued to improve on the originals. In many periods the later \\"repetitions\\" were often produced by the workshop of the master, with varying degrees of supervision and direct attention from him. This was especially the case with official portraits of monarchs and politicians, which in the Early Modern period were often ordered in large numbers of versions from the court artist as diplomatic gifts. Sometimes \\"reduced versions\\" that are considerably smaller than the prime one are made. Especially in the case of 19th-century repetitions, the term autograph replica is used of repetitions by the original artist.Codell, \\"Introduction\\" Contexts Portrait of Pope Julius II by Raphael, 1511‚Äì12, recognized since 1970 as the prime version In the case of official portraits the later creation of replica versions was likely to have been anticipated from the start, as in other types of art such as printmaking, but in other types of painting, especially history painting, the normal presumption, in the past as today, was that each work was a unique creation. This was a matter of some importance to the owner, and there was evidently in some periods a general understanding that a work should not be replicated or copied without the permission of the owner of the prime version, which needed to be asked for carefully and was not always given. In many periods \\"replicas were the direct product of collecting, as collectors have always preferred recognizable masterpieces to what is offbeat\\".Christiansen (2001), 21 This was true of 17th century Rome, where artists such as Orazio Gentileschi and Bernardo Strozzi routinely made replicas, and others such as Guercino and Guido Reni sometimes did,Christiansen (2001), 20-27 as of Victorian London, where artists such as William Powell Frith often painted one or more replica versions of their successes.Codell, throughout In Frith's case the replicas were painted many years after his first versions, when his newer work was achieving less success. The French painter Charles Landelle recorded no fewer than 32 versions of his Femme Fellah, an Orientalist hit at the Paris Salon of 1866.Harding, 9 Pieces of sculpture made by casting processes that allow the original model to be reproduced several times are rather different; though the first in an edition (today often kept by the artist) has some added prestige, it is expected that a number of versions will be made. Especially in the 19th century, carved marble sculptures were very often made mechanically using pointing machines following a clay or plaster modello by the artist, and further versions were produced as commissions came in. Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci, image of the replica version in Rome. An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the Galleria Borghese in Rome) and studies is Aeneas and his Family Fleeing Troy, the only secular history painting by Federico Barocci. The prime version was given in 1586 by Francesco Maria II, the last Duke of Urbino, to Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen Christina of Sweden, passed to the Orleans collection in Paris, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown. The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal Scipio Borghese.Turner, Nicholas, Federico Barocci, 2000, Vilo (109) Judging the prime version In some cases it is evident which version of a work is prime, especially if there is a full provenance including a contract or other documentation of the original commission; a contract for a copy will normally make that clear. Otherwise experts will look both at the overall quality of the work, and also technical elements such as detailed underdrawing and pentimenti (changes of mind) that indicate that the artist was finalizing his idea of the work as he proceeded. Infrared and X-ray photography are among the scientific techniques that may help in discovering these technical issues.Christiansen (1986), 436-438, and 432, provide examples of such discussions, relating to various paintings by Caravaggio Close comparison with the evolving style of other works by the artist and the comparison, ideally physically side by side, between two rival versions will often lead to a clear conclusion,Millar but sometimes arguments between experts may take decades to reach a conclusion, as with other issues of attribution. One of the most dramatic reassessments in recent decades, of a very important work, came in 1970 when a new assessment of a version of the Portrait of Pope Julius II by Raphael drew on a combination of new scientific research and archival knowledge, as x-rays revealed an inventory number from 1693, as well as a background that Raphael had repainted. The version in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, previously considered prime, was replaced by the version in the National Gallery, London, previously considered a replica.Dunkerton and Roy, 757-759, which reports further testing modifying the earlier conclusions of Gould, 208-10. Examples *Leonardo da Vinci, Virgin of the Rocks; prime Louvre, second version National Gallery, London *Jean-Baptiste Greuze, The Laundress, 1761, prime J. Paul Getty Museum, second version Fogg Museum *Antonio Canova, Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss; prime Louvre (completed 1793), other versions Hermitage Museum (1796) and elsewhere. An example of a relatively recent work where documentary evidence means that the prime version has never been in dispute. *William Powell Frith, The Derby Day; prime (1858) Tate Britain, second version (1893‚Äì94) Manchester City Art Gallery, plus a much smaller but highly finished \\"original study\\", sold at Christie's for ¬£505,250 in December 2011.Re-discovered William Powell Frith sells at auction, BBC News, 16 December 2011; Sale of study, Christie's, lot details 15 December 2011, Frith Derby Day *Ary Scheffer, Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta Appraised by Dante and Virgil (and variant titles). Probably his best-known work; over 15 years after the original he produced several smaller versions. The prime version, from 1835, measures ; now Wallace Collection in London. The second version (1854), measuring , is in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. The third version (1855) is now in the Louvre. Another version from 1851 measuring is in the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio. The Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh has another version. *The famous Ancient Egyptian Nefertiti Bust in Berlin is thought to be a finished modello, largely in plaster, for studio use in making other official portraits. *The Greek Slave, by the American sculptor Hiram Powers, was produced in six marble versions (typically for the period, all carved by assistants from the artist's plaster modello), and further reduced versions.

Aggregators usually provide two main functions; they allow FX traders to compare price from different liquidity venues such as banks-global market makers or ECNs like Currenex, FXall or Hotspot FX and to have a consolidated view of the market. They allow traders to trade with many participants using a single API or a single trading terminal. Some of the systems support order sweeping (an order is split into the chunks which are sent to the respective counterparties based on the price, time and other attributes of the quotes from these counterparties), other systems route the whole order to a single liquidity provider who is chosen by an order routing algorithm embedded into an aggregator. Technology FX Aggregator implementation is complex as the technology needs to be fast (Latencies in microseconds) and flexible. Some banks developed their own FX Aggregators and others bought existing products from technology vendors. Aggregators There are many aggregators offered in the market: smartTrade LiquidityFX, Thomson Reuters Dealing Aggregator, Liquid-X, Liquidity Pool, FlexTrade, BidFX, Quotix, Integral, Currenex, LMAX Exchange, MarketFactory, EBS Direct, DealHub, Seamless FX, Gold-i Matrix and others.

He has investigated the Syrian Civil War, 2014‚Äì15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and the Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. He first gained mainstream media attention by identifying weapons in uploaded videos from the Syrian conflict. He is the founder of Bellingcat, a website for the citizen journalist to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures. Life and work Higgins was born in Shrewsbury in January 1979. He attended Adams' Grammar School in Shropshire from 1990‚Äì95. He previously worked in finance and administration. In 2012, when Higgins began blogging about the Syrian civil war, he was unemployed and spent his days taking care of his child at home; his wife is Turkish. Higgins took the pseudonym Brown Moses from the Frank Zappa song \\"Brown Moses\\" on the album Thing-Fish. Higgins' analyses of Syrian weapons, which began as a hobby out of his home in his spare time, are frequently cited by the press and human rights groups and have led to parliamentary discussion. His Brown Moses Blog began in March 2012 by covering the Syrian conflict. Higgins operates by monitoring over 450 YouTube channels daily looking for images of weapons and tracking when new types appear in the war, where, and with whom. According to Guardian reporter Matthew Weaver, Higgins has been \\"hailed as something of a pioneer\\" for his work. Higgins has no background or training in weapons and is entirely self- taught, saying that \\"Before the Arab spring I knew no more about weapons than the average Xbox owner. I had no knowledge beyond what I'd learned from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo.\\" Higgins is credited with being among the first to report on the widespread use of improvised barrel bombs by the Syrian government, a phenomenon which has spread to other troubled nations such as Iraq to combat insurgencies and opposition forces. Other aspects of the Syrian conflict uncovered and documented by Higgins include the use of cluster bombs in 2012, which the Syrian government denied using; the proliferation of shoulder-launched heat-seeking missiles known as MANPADS; and the proliferation of Croatian-made weapons which was reportedly connected to the United States, a story later picked up by The New York Times. He has also investigated the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons, including the Ghouta chemical attack in detail. Higgins has also performed contract work for Human Rights Watch and Action on Armed Violence. In 2015, MIT Professor Theodore Postol, and Richard Lloyd, a former UN weapons inspector, criticised aspects of Higgins's work. Postol described him as \\"a one man news agency\\" adding \\"he was quoted by the Guardian, the New York Times, as an experienced war correspondent. And that without speaking a word of Arabic, without appropriate training, without studying politics or journalism\\". Higgins used geolocation to publish an estimate of where the James Foley execution video was made outside Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in north-central Syria. Higgins used visual markers in stills from the video and his interpretation of satellite images of the terrain around Raqqa. In 2018 Higgins was a visiting research associate at the Centre for Science and Security Studies (CSSS) at the Department of War Studies at King‚Äôs College London and visiting research fellow at University of California Berkeley's Human Rights Center. In October of that year, Higgins was the subject of BBC Radio Four's programme Profile. Bellingcat On 15 July 2014, Higgins began a new website called Bellingcat for citizen journalists to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures. Its launch was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. Bellingcat's self-taught open-source analysts include Higgins and eight volunteers. Among its major projects, Bellingcat has investigated the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine. Its work is being considered by the Dutch police investigating the crash, and Higgins has been interviewed twice by the investigators. Bellingcat has suggested that the anti-aircraft missile that hit the plane was fired by a Russian unit, the 53rd Buk brigade, based in the city of Kursk. On 31 May 2015, Bellingcat released a report alleging among other things photo manipulation of satellite images released by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The photos concerned the location of Ukrainian Buk missile launchers around the time MH17 was shot down. Bellingcat's use of error level analysis in its report was criticized by Jens Kriese, a professional image analyst. Nevertheless, Bellingcat's findings about which field the missile was fired from were vindicated in September 2016 by the Dutch-led MH17 Joint Investigation Team. The Atlantic Council From 2016 until early 2019, Higgins was a senior fellow in the Digital Forensic Research Lab and Future Europe Initiative; projects run by the Atlantic Council, a leading US geopolitical strategy think-tank based in Washington, D.C. In 2015, Higgins partnered with the Atlantic Council to co-author the report Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin's War in Ukraine which examined direct Russian military involvement in Ukraine. The report was the inspiration for the documentary Selfie Soldiers in which Vice News correspondent Simon Ostrovsky followed digital traces left by a Russian soldier named Bato Dambaev who was sent to fight in Eastern Ukraine. In June 2015 on the invitation of former Belgium Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, Higgins together with his report co-author Atlantic Council's Maks Czuperski presented Hiding in Plain Sight at the European Parliament alongside Russian opposition figure Ilya Yashin and former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. Higgins was also one of five authors of an Atlantic Council report released in 2016, ‚ÄúDistract, Deceive, Destroy,‚Äù on Russia‚Äôs role in Syria. Reception Higgins has received significant praise and support from human rights groups, journalists, and non-profit organisations. \\"Brown Moses is among the best out there when it comes to weapons monitoring in Syria,\\" said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. The New York Times war reporter C.J. Chivers said that fellow journalists owe a debt to Higgins' investigative reporting in Syria. \\"Many people, whether they admit or not, have been relying on that blog's daily labour to cull the uncountable videos that circulate from the conflict,\\" he said. Amnesty International said that the Brown Moses Blog was vital in proving the Syrian government was using ballistic missiles, information then used to send a research mission to Syria. Eliot Higgins has been a subject of interest for the British and U.S. media and is described as \\"one of the world's foremost citizen journalists\\" by News Limited reporter Victoria Craw. He has been profiled in print by The Guardian, The Independent, The Huffington Post, and The New Yorker. Television features have been run by Channel 4 News and CNN International. He has also been covered by non-English sources. In 2019 he was announced as one of Foreign Policy magazines Global Thinkers. 'Eliot Higgins has shown that a laptop with access to social media, YouTube, and Google Maps can reveal more about far-flung wars than government intelligence agencies can. And it all began with Bellingcat, a website he launched in 2014 through a successful Kickstarter campaign. After breakthrough revelations from battlefields in Ukraine and Syria, Higgins used open-source intelligence in 2018 to track down the identities of two Russian operatives who allegedly poisoned the former spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom.'

Play A game of snow snake is played by four teams, called \\"corners\\", who compete in trying to throw their wooden \\"snow snakes\\" the farthest along a long trough, or track, of snow. The game is divided into rounds, and in a round each team gets four throws. At the end of each round, two points are awarded to the team of the person who made the farthest throw in the round, and one point is awarded for the second farthest throw. Play continues until one of the teams wins, by achieving a certain predetermined number of points (usually 7 or 11). There are two roles on a snow snake team: the Player, and the Goaler. The main role of a Goaler is to craft and maintain a team's wooden \\"snow snakes\\" in between games. The Goaler is also tasked with selecting which will be used for each throw during the game. A Player, meanwhile, is a player who actually throws the snow snakes during a game. Equipment The poles used in the game, collectively known as \\"snow snakes\\", have different names depending on their length. The smallest poles used are the six-inch-long \\"snow darts\\". The next size up is the three- foot-long \\"short snake\\", also known as a \\"mud cat\\". Longer poles are known only as \\"snow snakes\\", and can be anywhere from six to ten feet in length. Snow snakes can be made from a variety of materials. In the Sioux tribe, they were traditionally made of bone, with feathers trailing behind for symbolic decoration, while other tribes traditionally used native North American hardwoods, such as maple, oak, apple, hickory, and juneberry. In modern times, other hardwoods not traditionally available, such as ebony, have become popular materials for snow snakes. Many players customize their snow snakes, by decorating them with colorful designs, or adding minor modifications, such as waxing the wooden surface. Full-size snow snakes at Ganondagan State Historic Site The trough, or track, that snow snakes are thrown down is typically five inches deep, rising up in a slope at the end where the players stand. In modern times, some groups will add obstacles like jumps or snow barriers to their tracks, for added interest. History According to the Iroquois oral tradition, the game of snow snake dates back more than 500 years, to before the arrival of Europeans in North America. Originally a form of communication between villages, the throwing of \\"snow snakes\\" in a trough of snow developed into a competitive sport during long winters when the long track was not used for communication. The name \\"snow snake\\" is said to have come from the serpentine wiggling motion of the poles as they slide down the icy track.

It is intended to provide balance and support. If backless, it is known as a birth stool. The early birthing chairs varied between having three or four legs, though three legged birthing chairs are most commonly seen.Carson, Amanda. Birth Chairs, Midwives, and Medicine. Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 1999.5. Print. Both styles support the bottom of the women in labor and often have a slender, sloped back for comfort and to allow birthing assistants, who are positioned behind the mother in labor, to massage or support her. Often the arms of the chair have hand holds or arm rests for the mother to grip, providing extra leverage. Birthing chairs are usually 8 to 10 inches (20.32 centimeters- 25.4 centimeters) off the ground specifically to allow laboring women to brace their feet against the ground to help in pushing. History Birthing chair The birthing chair has been used for millennia. It appears in the Bible's observation: ‚ÄòAnd he said, ‚ÄòWhen ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the birthstool‚Äô (Exodus 1:16). Birthing chairs took the place of laboring mothers sitting on birth attendant‚Äôs laps, as it was the previous practice. These chairs were used before male physicians dominated the delivery room. The use of the birthing chair or similar devices has been seen around the globe, not isolated to a particular region. A woman giving birth in the upright position has been seen in Asian, African, Pacific Islander, and Native American art. The birthing chair can be traced to Egypt in the year 1450 B.C.E. Pictured on the walls of The Birth House at Luxor, Egypt, is an Egyptian queen giving birth on a stool. It can also be traced to Greece in 200 B.C as it is featured on an ancient Grecian sculpted votive. Celtic items from 100 B.C.E in Britain also depict women sitting in the same upright position as if in a birthing chair. The first depiction in a woodcut from the 16thc shows a woman sitting on a stool and surrounded by other women. The three legged birth stool, sometimes called a groaning stool, was designed to be carried disassembled, and sits low to the ground. Some examples, such as this continental birthing chair, are adjustable with the back extending so the woman could move from an upright position to a reclined position. Wooden birthing chair Birthing chairs fell out of use after physicians began using the flat bed for women to lie on during delivery. The concept of the birthing chair has also been written in observations by anthropologist as well as missionaries. In modern times Modern birthing chair As of the 1980s the birthing chair has been making a comeback in the modern medicine of childbirth. Some expecting mothers have reverted to the birthing chair for its upright position because it allows gravity to assist in the expulsion of the baby, and a position upright but more or less immobile'. Studies have shown that the birthing chair speeds up the time of delivery and increases comfort for expecting mothers. The position of the birthing chair allows muscles (including vaginal and abdominal as well as those in the back, stomach, legs, and arms) used in childbirth to work to efficiency. Since the 1980s many hospitals have begun installing birthing chairs due to the large number of enquiries about them.Otten M.D, Carl . \\"Rebirth of the Birthing Chair.\\" Saturday Evening Post. 254.1 (1982): 69. Web. 28 Feb. 2013. A modern birthing chair/stool can be made of many different materials including PVC inflatables such as the CUB support, plastic such as the Kaya stool and padded wooden stools. More recently birthing chairs/stools have been made to accommodate several upright positions such as squatting, all fours, kneeling and sitting, and are used as supports not necessarily as chairs or stools. Research suggests that being upright during labour can have many positive benefits for mother and baby.Child birth in squatting position Ayesha Nasir, K.J. Noorani, Razia Korejo Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi. 2007 Using a modern- day birthing chair/stool/support during the first stage of labour can aid a woman in having an upright birth.

He was involved in 74 feature film productions since his debut in Fred Young's Saputangan in 1949. Biography Lilik was born in Makassar, Dutch East Indies, on 14 May 1930 to Astaman and his wife. Taking the pseudonym Astaman Jr., Lilik began his stage career as a teenager during the Indonesian National Revolution, joining the Bintang Timoer troupe with his father under the leadership of Djamaluddin Malik. In 1949 he made his film debut with a small role in Fred Young's Saputangan (Handkerchief). The following year he appeared in four further films, for three different production companies. He had his last on-screen role in 1951's Surjani Mulia, directed by Mohammad Said Hamid Junid and produced by Malik's film company Persari. Also in 1951 Lilik had his first experience as a member of a film crew, working the clapperboard and writing scripts for the company's production Dunia Gila. After several years of working menial tasks and learning the production side of the industry, Lilik was tasked as director for Tarmina in 1954. For the film, which followed a young woman named Tarmina who married multiple times before committing suicide, Lilik directed his father, as well as Fifi Young, A Hadi, and Djauhari Effendi. The film was recognised as the Best Film at the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival in 1955, and Lilik was recognised as Best Director. However, the decision was controversial: the festival's panel was decried by film critics as having sold out to Malik, as they considered D. Djajakusuma's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew; 1954) to be a much more solid work. After his success with Tarmina, Lilik directed and, later, produced and edited several dozen films. He took a hiatus between 1960 and 1962 to study cinema at the University of California, Los Angeles. After Persari was closed in the 1960s Lilik went between studios. For his editing of the film Juda Saba Desa (1966) Lilik received Best Editing at the 1967 Indonesian Film Festival. He made his final feature film in 1990 with Misteri dari Gunung Merapi III (Perempuan Berambut Api) (Mystery from Mount Merapi III: The Girl with the Firey Hair). This silat (martial arts) film saw Fendi Pradana as Sembara, a skilled warrior who must save his compatriots from a woman with fire for hair. As the Indonesian film industry saw a downturn in 1992, Lilik began directing sinetron (television shows), including Mahkota Madangkara (Crown of Madangkara; 1992), Si Buta Dari Goa Hantu (The Blind Man from Ghost Cave; 1994) and Cinta Dalam Misteri (Love in Mysteries; 1996). Lilik died on 9 December 2014.

There was a 21-week national tour 1959-1960, co-starring Davis's husband Gary Merrill, towards the end, he was replaced by Barry Sullivan. Afterwards, there was a one-month run at the Henry Miller Theatre in the fall of 1960, co-starring Leif Erickson. Guitar accompaniment and singing was provided by the folk singer and guitarist Clark Allen. For the opening performances, both of the tour and on Broadway, Sandburg himself spoke after the production. A printed text version, with commentary by Corwin and Sandburg, was then published in 1961.  Norman Corwin background  Since the 1930s, Corwin had been adapting Sandburg for the stage in various ways. In 1958, he was approached by Leonard Karzmar to create a production honoring Sandburg in his 80th year. The result was a Hollywood star-studded evening held on the campus of UCLA. When, a few months later, Corwin was asked for \\"suggestions for an evening of 'concert style' theater\\", he chose the Sandburg Tribute as a model, but reworked it for three performers.  Bette Davis background  In the late 1950s, Davis's career as a celebrated Hollywood actress was seemingly over, with several failures in a row. She had even agreed to a television role, but the pilot was not even aired. Davis was considering a return to live theater when she was approached for the Sandburg staging, and she and her husband, Gary Merrill, signed on without a script. As Davis and Merrill lived in Maine, rehearsals were held at Bowdoin College, and the show premiered in Portland. Their marriage was falling apart at the time, and the national tour accelerated their personal acrimony. Davis and Merrill, during the tour, ended up staying in widely separated rooms. Davis served Merrill with divorce papers during the tour, and Barry Sullivan substituted for Merrill.  On Broadway  The Broadway production, with Leif Erickson, received four favorable reviews out of seven in the New York papers. Overall, the show was a failure, and closed after one month. Corwin lists numerous excuses, none of which he believes, while he barely hints at what several Davis biographers state explicitly: the Davis-Merrill on-stage chemistry had been a major draw.

Four workers at the plant were killed by the explosion, and eighteen others were injured. The seven-story building at the seat of the blast was completely destroyed, leaving only a crater, and significant damage was inflicted to the surrounding structures. Four nearby electricity generating stations were disabled by the explosion, and the effects of the blast were felt up to 30 miles away. A high-voltage line running adjacent to the plant and over the Missouri River was damaged, disrupting power in the neighboring state of Nebraska. Two 15,000-ton refrigerated ammonia storage tanks were ruptured, releasing liquid ammonia and ammonia vapors which forced the evacuation of 1,700 residents from the surrounding area. Causes of accident An investigation conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded in 1996 that the explosion was initiated by an accelerated thermal decomposition reaction as \\"a direct result of unsafe operating procedures and conditions\\" at the plant.The investigation team concluded that the explosion resulted from a lack of written, safe operation procedures at the Terra Port Neal ammonium nitrate plant. The lack of safe operating procedures resulted in conditions in the plant that were necessary for the explosion to occur. The significant conditions that caused the explosion were: 1\\\\. Strongly acidic conditions in the neutralizer and rundown tank; 2\\\\. Prolonged application of 200 psig steam to the neutralizer nitric acid spargers; 3\\\\. The creation of bubbles and low density zones in the neutralizer; 4\\\\. Lack of flow in the neutralizer and rundown tank; 5\\\\. The presence of chlorides, from a cooling water leak, in the neutralizer and rundown tank; 6\\\\. Lack of monitoring of the ammonium nitrate plant after the plant was shut down with the process vessels charged. The EPA had conducted a safety audit at the plant just eight months prior to the explosion. The plant was Iowa's largest producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers and its loss contributed to a national 50% increase in the cost of fertilizer by the following year.

Cape Tembwe is about six hours' walk north of Mpala. When Thomson reached the cape he found the countryside devastated by the effects of slave raiding by a chief known as Lusinga. The large village at Tembwe was full of refugees. The region along the lake shore from Cape Tembwe south into Zambia and inland into the Marungu massif is inhabited by Tabwa people. North of the cape the people identify themselves as Holoholo.

Like its sister-album Goldregen it was recorded and released relatively quickly in 1997-8. Unlike Goldregen ‚Äì which featured only acoustic instruments ‚Äì Year of the Tiger is predominantly electronic and beat-driven. The entire album is performed live on the CD Live at Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf. Background and recording The album is named for a phrase used in a postcard sent by an American fan named George to Klaus Dinger in 1998, referring to the zodiac calendar, according to which the Year of the Tiger began on 28 January 1998. The back of the postcard features on the cover artwork. Recording began in October 1997, after La! Neu?'s pianist Rembrandt Lensink (whose album Rembrandt: God Strikes Back was released in January 1998) presented Dinger with a lengthy synthesizer piece which could not fit on his own album. Dinger decided to work the piece into a La! Neu? album, and had Rembrandt re-record the basic synthesizer track. Some time in 1998 this was overdubbed with Dinger's drum playing and Victoria Wehrmeister's vocals to create \\"Autoportrait Rembrandt\\", a half-hour-long trance-esque motorik piece. After this a second long piece was begun, built around a circulating guitar riff played by Dinger. Added to this was a motorik drum loop and a further guitar part by Dinger's friend Rudige \\"Spinello\\" Elze (who had last played with Dinger in the 1980s) as well as another of Wehrmeister's improvised vocal parts. This track was named \\"Notre Dame\\" after Wehrmeister's lyric (although also possibly in reference to Harmonia's album Deluxe, which features several tracks similar in character to Year of the Tiger, and one named \\"Notre Dame\\"). Both tracks display a high standard of production in comparison to the looser Goldregen and also a greater focus on rhythm. Dinger said in August 1998‚Äî Around the same time as these sessions, Dinger met up with Eberhard Kranemann for the first time since the 1970s. Kranemann had lived with Dinger in a D√ºsseldorf commune for a while in the early '70s, and had played bass and slide guitar for Neu! and Kraftwerk. When Dinger founded a record label in 1973, he had intended to release a Fritz M√ºller (Kranemann's stage name) album on it, but never did. Dinger therefore became interested in helping Kranemann release an album using the La! Neu? imprint on Captain Trip Records. Kranemann's band \\"Bluepoint Underground\\" was thus brought to meet Dinger, and recorded a short, multi-tracked song with Dinger and Wehrmeister. This was incorporated onto Year of the Tiger as \\"Intro\\", partly in order to promote Bluepoint Underground's album Bluepoint Underground in New York City, which was released on CTR later in 1998 (with Dinger as producer).

South of the N1, the road is designated the M81. Heading north out of the city, it passes Montecasino, before crossing the R564 (Witkoppen Road). North of Witkoppen Road, it passes through the affluent Lonehill and Dainfern suburbs into the township of Diepsloot. It then meets the western end of the R562 from Midrand and forms an interchange with the N14 Highway. On the other side of the N14 interchange, it enters the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality and intersects with the R114 at a staggered junction (co-signed for 1.6 kilometres). The road then reaches a t-junction. The north-south road becomes Pretoria's M26, and the road given off to the north-west towards Hartbeespoort is designated the R511.

It bears some similarities to Fives; however, it is played with a solid wooden bat rather than one's hand. History of the sport The History of the sport came about from Downside's situation at the time, as there was no room for anything else, there were fewer than sixty boys in the School throughout the 1820s. Abbot Snow, an Abbot of Downside Abbey, once said how football, 'not the tactical manoeuvring of backs and forwards, but the rough-and-tumble game of kicking how and when you could' was the favourite sport, together with 'cricket of a sort' and 'handball in the spring'. By the end of the nineteenth century it had become a part of Downside folklore that the term 'handball' was a translation of the generic \`jeu de paume' and referred to a long-popular game known as 'bat and ball' that had come over with Downside from the continent, as evidenced by the very similar game being played at Ushaw College which, like Downside, had its origins at Douai in Flanders. However, extensive research by the late Dom Lucius Graham OSB has shown that, prior to the building of the present Ball Place, the only version of the game known to Gregorians was not only called 'handball' but was indeed played with the hand. Dom Lucius surmised that the wall's size, and particularly its height, which exceeded the requirements of Handball, prompted the introduction of the bat. Certainly, at the time Dom Stephen Rawlinson came as a schoolboy in 1876, both the hand and the bat varieties were in use, though the former seems to have lost favour and vanished, owing, notes a later commentator, to damage to the players' hands. In its heyday, a boy who was good at bat-and-ball 'was as much thought of as a successful cricketer', but, by the end of the nineteenth century, it, too, was losing favour on the plea that it was 'too much fag' to make the cork, worsted and leather balls. A sample of the bat, some 27 inches long with a small broadening at the business end, famous for having been used by The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) during his visit to Downside in 1932, is currently on display in the Court of Arches at Downside. The balls are never more than 1¬Ω inches in diameter and the strokes were made with a downward sweep of the arm. ‚ÄòThe Ball Place‚Äô The layout of the Ball Place (at Downside School) The Wall is a massive structure, some 12 metres high by 30 wide, comprising two playing walls, each with angled wings, and an open- fronted shelter forming a sort of distance-piece between them. It was within a few years of the opening of this grand court that Bat-and-Ball made its appearance. The game can be traced from at least when the Gregorian community made its first purchase of property at Stratton-on-the-Fosse by a deed dated 25 March 1814, the estate consisted of the building we now know as the Old House, some farm buildings behind it and about one hundred acres of farmland. The need for self-sufficiency meant that much of this land had to remain under agriculture and it was only very gradually that successive fields were taken into use as grounds and pitches. It was inevitable in these circumstances that ball games were largely informal ad hoc pastimes during the various breaks for recreation - and there is a similar version from Douai from which this evolved. There had in fact been no fewer than three ball places at Downside before 1854. The first, put up soon after our arrival in 1814, was roughly at a point just south of the present 'Parrot Cage'. This was probably demolished or moved in 1823 to make room for the Old Chapel block. The second seems to have been where the Main Hall of Downside School now stands and was apparently replaced on the same or a nearby site by a new one in 1831. This, too, was overtaken by the need for a new study room (now the Main Hall) and theatre (now, the Petre Library), which were opened in 1854. Thus it was that in that same year, by subscription (what we would now call an appeal), the present Ball Place, or, more accurately, the pair of ball places, was erected. As originally landscaped, the playing area fanned out eastward to form a series of pleasing, if somewhat useless, terraced steps that descended to the curious 'temporary' building which we now know as the Gasquet Hall. Thirty years later, a pious benefactor, known only from the (still legible) inscription on the plinth, Ora pro me datore 1884, erected a large stone statue of Our Lady at the centre of the second step. A few yards further down were two beech trees, each encircled by an outdoor seat, which lasted until the late 1940s. Sadly, the whole grand design was much reduced and unbalanced in 1958, and again in 1963, by the intrusion of two modern buildings, leaving the Statue of Our Lady somewhat incongruously facing the blank gable end of what we still call the New Classrooms. By 1996, the statue had become unsafe, weathered beyond restoration, and was taken down, leaving The Ball Place with a vacant plinth. The southern end of the wall was damaged by a falling tree in the great storm of 1990 and rebuilt with insurance money. At about the same time the whole area was re-surfaced with tarmacadam and its lower reaches grassed over. This, then, is the Ball Place that we know today and, in all essentials, its wall and court have not changed since 1854, but the game lingered on with periodic outbreaks of enthusiasm for what was inevitably becoming an antiquarian curiosity until surface disrepair during the Second World War made the courts virtually unplayable. It has proved itself to be such a useful and versatile space that it could be deemed to have justified its existence even without its early use for its intended purpose. Over the years, it has served as a parade ground for the CCF (and its predecessors the OTC and the JTC); as the site of gym displays; as an all-weather hockey pitch; as a recreation ground for small cricket, cycling and, most recently, skateboarding and radio- controlled model cars. On Prize Day it serves as a car park. Its walls have inevitably been much used for tennis practice (in the 1980s it had white targets painted on it for serving practice) and its alcove or shelter has often housed Corpus Christi altars. At least once it has been the setting for a play (Macbeth) and, before the (now demolished) outdoor rifle range was built, it was frequently used for shooting and still bears the scars. Last, but not least, it has served to fuel the curiosity of visitors. Dom Hubert van Zeller reports, in his book, Downside By and Large (1953), how boys have been heard 'with mistaken loyalty and rich imagination' explaining to visitors that the Ball Place wall is all that is left of the ancient Abbey of St Gregory's, dissolved by Henry VIII. Game rules and terms An example of the Bats and Balls used in The Downside Ball Game 1- The game is played by four players, two on each side. 2- A game consists of 21 points. 3- Points can only be scored by the side which is serving (i.e. ‚Äúin‚Äù), not by the side which is receiving the service (i.e. ‚Äúout‚Äù). 4- Serving : (i) Both players on the side which is ‚Äúin‚Äù serve in turn: first one serves until his side loses in a rally (always called a ‚Äúdodge‚Äù) and then the other; when both have been put ‚Äúout‚Äù, the other side comes ‚Äúin‚Äù. But in the cases of the side which goes ‚Äúin‚Äù first and when both sides are ‚Äúgame-ball‚Äù (i.e. 20 points each), only one player serves, it does not matter which. When only one side is ‚Äúgame-ball‚Äù, only one player on that side serves, but both players on the other side serve until they too reach ‚Äúgame-ball‚Äù. (ii) A player serves by hitting the ball full toss against the front wall or against one of the corners; in this latter case he must first call ‚Äúcorners play‚Äù; if he does not do so, the players, who are ‚Äúout‚Äù may try at it the same way as a ‚Äúnot over‚Äù ball (see below section iv). (iii) If the served ball comes beyond the line marked across the floor of the court, about 11 feet from the edge of the ball-place and does not bounce below the lower stone rib, it is ‚Äúover‚Äù and must be taken by the ‚Äúout‚Äù players. N.B.‚Äî On the serve the returner must take the ball first bounce, not full pitch. (iv) If the served ball does not come ‚Äúover‚Äù, the ‚Äúout‚Äù players may take the service or not as they please; but if the serve is taken and the ball is hit out of the court or below the stone rib which is about two and a half feet above the floor, the ‚Äúin‚Äù side scores no point; but if the ball hits the wall correctly and a ‚Äúdodge‚Äù follows, that side scores, which wins the ‚Äúdodge‚Äù. (v) When a side is ‚Äúgame-ball‚Äù, the players of that side may not serve off the corners; they must also call ‚Äúgame-ball play‚Äù before serving, otherwise they cannot win the game off that point, even if they win the ‚Äúdodge‚Äù. (vi) If the server misses the ball altogether he is not ‚Äúout‚Äù unless he misses three times in succession; if in serving he fails to hit the wall above the lower stone rib, or he misses the wall entirely or the ball bounces out of the court, he is ‚Äúout‚Äù; if, when meaning to serve off the front wall, he hits the corner, or if, when meaning to serve off the corner and having called ‚Äúcorners play‚Äù, he hits the front wall, the ‚Äúout players‚Äù may treat it as a ‚Äúnot over‚Äù ball (see section iv above) (vii) While a player is serving and until the service has been taken by an ‚Äúout‚Äù player, the server‚Äôs partner must stand between the wall and the ‚Äúover‚Äù line; provided that he does not move out of this area, he may prevent a serve not going out over the side lines with his bat or his hand, but not in any other way. The same applies to any service which is obviously not going ‚Äúover‚Äù. 5- The play : (i) In a ‚Äúdodge‚Äù the ball may be hit first bounce or full pitch. (ii) If the ‚Äúin‚Äù side wins a ‚Äúdodge‚Äù, one point is added to that side‚Äôs score; if the ‚Äúout‚Äù side wins, the server is put out and the server‚Äôs partner serves; when both have been put out, the ‚Äúout‚Äù side comes ‚Äúin‚Äù. (iii) The ball must always hit the wall above the lower stone rib; if it hits the sloping top of the ball-place or the stone rib across the upper part of the wall and bounces in the court, the player on the other side taking it, may claim an ‚Äúhindrance‚Äù; but if he takes it, not claiming an ‚Äúhindrance‚Äù, then the ‚Äúdodge‚Äù continues and a score for one side or the other results. (iv) If a player in taking a ball from a serve or in a ‚Äúdodge‚Äù hits one of his opponents with the ball above the knee, it is counted ‚Äúup‚Äù, but is always an ‚Äúhindrance‚Äù; but if it hits the opponent below the knee, it counts as a ‚Äúmiss‚Äù, and the opponents‚Äô side wins the ‚Äúdodge‚Äù. If the ball hits his partner, it is also a ‚Äúmiss‚Äù and the opponents‚Äò side wins the ‚Äúdodge‚Äù. Unintentional obstruction of the striker by one of the other side or by any other person or accidental occurrence from without (but not of course by the striker‚Äôs partner or as a result of his own slipping or the like) is always an ‚Äúhindrance‚Äù. (v) If a serve pitches on the ‚Äúover‚Äù line, it is not ‚Äúover‚Äù; if in a serve or ‚Äúdodge‚Äù, the ball pitches on the side line dividing the two courts, it is in, if on the stone curb on the other it is out; if on the edge of the stone rib, it is in. The stone pillar may not be claimed as an ‚Äúhindrance‚Äù owing to the ball bouncing near it. \\"(vi)\\" If the ball bounces past the out line, 6 feet from the back of the Ball Place, then the team who hit the ball loses that point. (vii) Some conventions and general remarks about the play:‚ÄîA player can never win a point by ‚Äúsneaking‚Äù, i.e. by hitting the ball very low on the wall or very gently on purpose: he should always try to hit the ball hard and as high on the wall as possible; if he cannot hit the ball hard owing to the risk of it going out of the court because of the angle to the wall at which he is taking it, he should at any rate hit the ball high on the wall. When one side is ‚Äúgame-ball‚Äù, the other side may ‚Äúsneak‚Äù when it is ‚Äúout‚Äù, not when it is ‚Äúin‚Äù: when both sides are ‚Äúgame-ball‚Äù, only the side which is ‚Äúout‚Äù may ‚Äúsneak‚Äù. Corner services can never be used. However, they can be used by a side which is a long way behind the other in an effort to try and catch up; but the normal service is a straightforward high serve off the front wall. In fact the essence of the game is to have a good ‚Äúdodge‚Äù and a close game. In the course of a ‚Äúdodge‚Äù play off the corners is not only legitimate, but often the best thing to do, e.g., if a player is drawn well to the side of the court in order to take a ball, the best shot is to the opposite corner. A certain amount of ‚Äúbarracking‚Äù is traditional. Legacy The apparent death of the game as a serious sport was surely inevitable, following the transformation of Downside, during the decade preceding the First World War, from a Continental-style college into a mainstream public school: these were the years that saw the Introduction of Rugby Football, Squash, Racquets and, above all, Lawn Tennis. Against such, the older, less sophisticated game, with no prospect of external match fixtures, stood little chance of survival and all efforts to re-introduce it have, so far, failed. However, in 2013 the game was re-introduced into the school life and is fast becoming a major sport at Downside School, with inter- house matches played in the summer term. The Ball Place is still there and continues, as it has for almost 200 years, to be a significant facility in the life of the school.

The battle was fought during the night of 7 February 1813 at the √éles de Los, off Guinea. It lasted four hours, causing significant damage and casualties to both opponents, and resulted in a stalemate. The two ships parted and returned to their respective ports of call, both sides claiming victory. Background After the British victory in the Mauritius campaign of 1809‚Äì1811, all French possessions in the Indian Ocean were now controlled by the British. France had already lost the use of Cape Town in 1806 after the Battle of Blaauwberg, and of Batavia in 1811 with the British Invasion of Java. Thus, in 1813, the French Navy lacked the advance bases it needed to support the commerce raiding frigate squadron that it had operated in the previous decade. It was therefore decided to send a force to the western coast of Africa to disrupt British shipping closer to the metropole, while still being far enough away to be beyond the reach of the powerful British naval divisions that blockaded the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. To this end, a frigate division was given to Captain Pierre Bouvet, a skilled frigate commander,James (p. 189) credits Bouvet as being \\"one best officers in the French navy\\". veteran of the Mauritius campaign and leader of the French forces during the second half of the Battle of Grand Port. The squadron comprised the 40-gun frigate , under Bouvet himself, and , under Commander Louis-Fran√ßois Ollivier.Quintin, p. 86.Fonds Marine, p. 476. Another two-frigate squadron, made up of Elbe and , was to perform the same mission with a two-week interval. Captain Pierre Bouvet, who commanded the French squadron, his flag on Ar√©thuse. On 25 November 1812, Bouvet's division departed from Nantes, sneaked through the British blockade, and established a station to the north-east of the Azores, near the group of five rocks called \\"Vigie des Cinq Grosses-T√™tes\\"Troude, p. 171. (44¬∞17'N, 21¬∞45'WMaiseau, p. 614.). The frigates then continued to cruise off Madeira and Cape Verde. During January, due to continual galesLecomte, p. 291. and preliminary symptoms of a fever epidemic, Bouvet decided to sail south with two prizes, the British cutter Hawk,James, p. 185 and the other the Portuguese slave ship Serra, to anchor at the √éles de Los, off Sierra Leone. On 27 January, the frigates and their prizes came in view of the islands when the 16-gun , under Lieutenant William Pascoe, appeared. Mistaking the French frigates for British cruisers, Daring launched a boat towards Rubis, which altered her course to intercept; as the frigate approached, the boat realised her error and attempted to flee, to no avail. Questioning his prisoners, Ollivier learnt the identity of his opponent, and gave chase. Hopelessly outmanned and outgunned, Pascoe threw his brig on the coast, on the north- western point of Tamara, and scuttled her by fire.Lecomte, p. 292.

Ashore, the French collected fruit, resupplied their fresh water, and gathered intelligence on the British deployment: the station of Sierra Leone comprised two frigates and several corvettes, but only was anchored in the bay at the time. After six days of repairs and resupply, Ar√©thuse and Rubis were ready for a six-month cruise; to unburden himself of his prisoners and prizes, Bouvet returned Serra to the Portuguese, and on 29 January, the British were released on parole and sent to Sierra Leone on Hawk. Bouvet departed on 4 February.Lecomte, p. 293.Troude (p. 171) say on the 1st; Lecomte (p. 293) says the 4th; Roche (p. 390) dates the destruction of Rubis to the 5th, entailing that her departure was on the 4th; The Fonds Marine (p. 477) concurs with Roche. Meanwhile, on 29 January, Lieutenant Pascoe had arrived at Freetown, with some of his men, and informed Amelia of the presence of what he believed to be three French frigates at Tamara. Hawk arrived the same evening with the prisoners on parole, confirming Pascoe's account; she was then equipped with a boat from Amelia and sent for a reconnaissance of the French squadron. Having volunteered, Pascoe returned with‚Äîthis time‚Äîan accurate description of the French division, including the names of the frigates and their prize. On 3 February, at 10:30, Amelia departed her anchorage and took the direction of the √éles de Los to intercept the French squadron. At the √éles de Los, Ar√©thuse had, upon departure, maneuvered to catch the wind and struck the bottom, breaking her rudder and forcing the squadron to drop anchor on the spot. That very night, a violent storm broke out, and both frigates broke their cables. Ar√©thuse managed to avoid running aground using a makeshift rudder, and in the morning found herself twelve miles to the north-west of Tamara; Bouvet dropped anchor as soon as he found the bottom to repair his rudder. Meanwhile, Rubis had been cast aground on the shore of Tamara.Troude, p. 172. At ten, she fired distress shots and signals; Ar√©thuse launched her longboat to assist, but could not maneuver herself without her rudder;Lecomte, p. 294. the launch carried two additional pumps to Rubis, but returned with the news that she was unsalvageable and that her crew was transferring on Serra.James, p. 184 The following night, the hull of the stranded Rubis broke under the stress of the waves.Lecomte, p. 295. Commander Ollivier scuttled her by fire and embarked his crew on Serra.Roche, p. 390. On 5 January, around 20:00, Amelia sighted a strange sail making night signals which, the next morning, turned out to be Princess-Charlotte, a government schooner from Sierra Leone. Amelia got sight of the French squadron half an hour later, and dispatched Princess-Charlotte to Sierra Leone to instruct any incoming British warship to come to her aid at once. She then observed what was deemed to be a prize being unloaded into one of the frigates, but was in fact Rubis transferring her crew to Serra, and the second frigate in the distance. Battle HMS 'Amelia' chasing the French frigate 'Arethuse' 1813, a fancifully titled representation of the early stages of the battle, by John Christian Schetky, 1852. On display at Norwich Castle. In the morning of 6 February, while Ar√©thuse was completing her repairs, appeared under the wind. Bouvet set sails to meet her and in the evening, the frigates sailed on parallel courses; As Irby was not aware of the demise of Rubis, he was attempting to lure Ar√©thuse away from her to prevent the two French frigates from supporting each other.James, p. 186 Ar√©thuse having a slight advantage, and hoping to overhaul his opponent during the night, Bouvet hoisted the French colours and fired a carronade; Amelia answered by hoisting the Union Jack and firing a shot. At dawn, a fog obscured the frigates from each other, and Bouvet could not engage. The next morning, Ar√©thuse found herself alone on the sea, and Bouvet followed the course that he assumed Amelia had taken; around eleven, she appeared on the horizon and Ar√©thuse put on all sails to give chase. The frigates raced all day and at 19:30, Irby decided that he was far enough to avoid interference from Rubis, and Amelia turned to confront her opponent.Lecomte, p. 296. Ar√©thuse was pierced for 44 guns, but actually mounted only 42: as her two foremost guns, obstructed by bollards, could not be maneuvered properly, Bouvet had ordered them stored in the hold.Troude, p. 173. This left Ar√©thuse with twenty-six 18-pounder long guns, two 8-pounder chase guns, and fourteen 24-pounder carronades. Amelia mounted twenty-six 18-pounders and twenty 32-pounder carronades. Her crew was reinforced by that of Daring. The frigates closed in to pistol range without opening fire.Lecomte, p. 297. As they passed each other, Ar√©thuse came about and fired her broadside at Amelia that cut the braces of her topsail; Amelia answered in kind, and then veered and abruptly decreased her speed, her davit touching Ar√©thuse at starboard. Ar√©thuse fired another broadside at point-blank range, and for the following hour and a half, the two frigates remained entangled, exchanging volleys, gunners from both sides snatching the ramrods of their opponents and duelling with sabres from one gunport and the other, but neither side attempting to board the other. After 90 minutes of cannonade and gunfire, Captain Irby and his two Lieutenants, John James Bates and John Pope,James, p. 187 were wounded. The third lieutenant, George Wells, was killed soon after taking command, and the master of Amelia, Anthony De Mayne, replaced him. Then, Bouvet attempted a boarding to decide the issue, but with her clewlines cut by shots, Ar√©thuse could not maneuver. At 21:00, the frigates separated.Lecomte, p. 298. The cannonade continued until eleven, until the frigates lost contact. Soon, a dense fog hid the frigates one from another, and it was not until the next morning that Amelia was spotted again. According to Bouvet's report, Ar√©thuse attempted to give chase, but to no avail. Aftermath HMS Amelia in action with the French Frigate Ar√©thuse, 1813, by John Christian Schetky, 1852. This painting was originally in the possession of the family of Frederick Paul Irby, captain of HMS Amelia. Each captain accused the other of having fled. Irby stated that Ar√©thuse \\"bore up, having the advantage of being able to do so, leaving us in an ungovernable state\\"; while Bouvet wrote \\"At eleven o'clock, firing ceased on both sides; we were no longer in range; and the enemy, putting on all sail, surrendered the battlefield to us\\".\\"A onze heures, le feu cessa de part et d'autre; nous n'√©tions plus √† bonne port√©e, et l'ennemi se couvrit de voiles, nous abandonnant le champ de bataille.\\" Original quoted in James, p. 187, with a few errors. Translation from the original. Bouvet's complete report is available at lebardeschoufs.com Another view is that the ships, their riggings both damaged, simply drifted away from each other under the effect of the cannonade.William Laid Clowes, The Royal Navy : a history from the earliest times to the present, Vol V, p. 521 Ar√©thuse had 20 killed and 98 wounded.Quintin (p. 86) gives a figure of 88 wounded; James (p. 188) gives a somehow different figure of 31 killed and 74 wounded. Amelia suffered 51 killed and 90 wounded.James, p. 188 Bouvet sailed to Tamara, where he rejoined Serra and the crew of Rubis on the 10th.James, p. 190 Serra was taken in tow for a few days before Bouvet scuttled her by fire, off Madeira, as she retarded Ar√©thuse. Ar√©thuse returned to Saint-Malo with no further encounter, where she arrived on 19 April 1813. During their mission, Rubis and Ar√©thuse had captured ten prizes.James (p. 190) gives a figure of fifteen prizes. Irby sailed to England, where he had been bound before the battle to repatriate sick sailors. He arrived at Spithead on 22 March, carrying large quantities of gold.James, p. 189 Navy Minister Decr√®s gave a mixed review of the events. On one hand, he praised Bouvet's bravery and conduct during the battle itself; in his report of the events, on 26 April 1813, he wrote: Louis-Philippe Cr√©pin did paint a depiction of the battle, which is in the collections of the Mus√©e de Versailles. The fight of the French frigate Ar√©thuse and Amelia on the shores of Guinea, 7 February 1813, by Louis-Philippe Cr√©pin. On the other hand, Decr√®s sharply criticised Bouvet for the wreck of Rubis and near-loss of Ar√©thuse in the storm of 5 February: Probably because of these mixed reviews, Bouvet was awarded the rank of Officer in the Legion of Honour, on 2 July, but was neither promoted to rear-admiral, nor made a Baron of the Empire, as had been requested in his favour.Quintin, p. 87.

Route North West Its northern origin is Brits, North West at an intersection with the R511 as Van Velden Street, becoming Rutgers Street, in a southerly direction. Just south of Brits, the R512 meets the R566 Road from Ga-Rankuwa. Soon after crossing the N4 Platinum Highway, It meets, and is briefly co- signed eastwards with, the R104 from Mooinooi. At Damdoryn, just after The Elephant Sanctuary of Hartbeespoort, as the R104 continues eastwards towards Hartbeespoort central, the R512 turns to the south-west, bypassing the Hartbeespoort Dam to the west, and it gives off the road to the south-westerly R560 Route. After meeting the R560, the R512 turns towards the south-east, crossing the Magalies River & turning eastwards by Arrows Rest, bypassing the Hartbeespoort Dam to the south, towards Broederstroom. The R512 makes a Z-shape from the Elephant Sanctuary to Broederstroom. After Broederstroom, near Pelindaba, by the Crocodile River, as the road eastwards connects to Pretoria, the R512 turns southwards, as Pelindaba Road, towards Johannesburg. Just after, the R512 crosses into Gauteng. Gauteng From Broederstroom, the R512 makes a 25km journey to Lanseria International Airport and the road then meets the R552 (6th Road), and forms and interchange with the N14 Highway (Pretoria-Krugersdorp Highway). After crossing the N14 highway and its old equivalent, the R114, it heads south towards Randburg, part of the Johannesburg Municipality, as Malibongwe Drive - formerly known as Hans Strijdom Drive. It passes through the lower-middle Cosmo City and Kya Sands townships before crossing the R564 Road (Witkoppen Road, Northumberland Avenue) and entering the more affluent Northriding and Olivedale suburbs. The R512 designation ends at an interchange with the N1 Highway (Johannesburg Western Bypass) (Johannesburg Ring Road), but Malibongwe Drive continues through Randburg to end north of the Johannesburg Botanical Garden. Road upgrade As of 2018, the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) is constructing a shortcut for the R512 Route, from its intersection with the north-eastern terminus of the R560 Route west of Broederstroom northwards up to just north of where the R512 and the R104 Route split west of The Elephant Sanctuary of Hartbeespoort, where there is a ramp onto the N4 Platinum Highway West, in a highway format. The junction with the R560 west of Hartbeespoort Dam is going to be an off-ramp junction and the next and last junction just north of the R104 and R512 junction west of the Elephant Sanctuary is also to be an off-ramp interchange before the freeway goes westwards to join the N4 West. It is being built to reduce the traffic that occurs on the current longer section of the R512 through Damdoryn, which is also labelled as a high accident zone.https://www.madibeng.gov.za/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/Hartbeespoort-Area-Precinct-Plan_Part3.pdf It is also meant to be a shortcut and to reduce the distance for travelers using the R512 to either join the N4 Highway West to Rustenburg & Sun City or to go to Brits. To some extent, this new route will also reduce the traffic on the R511 Route, which passes on the other side of the Hartbeespoort Dam (through Hartbeespoort Central) and when the road is done, long distance movements will no longer have to interfere with local traffic. It is to be used by motorists who want to travel from the Johannesburg Municipality (Sandton & Randburg) (and nearby areas, like Pretoria West) to cities like Brits, Sun City and Rustenburg. On 03 September 2020, the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, together with the South African National Roads Agency and the Madibeng Local Municipality, officially opened the new road. This route, known as the Pampoen Nek Highway, is 6 kilometres in length (6 kilometres shorter than the Z-shaped route through Damdoryn and the Elephant Sanctuary).

Description The community includes the villages of Capel Coch, Ceint, Llanddyfnan, Llangwyllog, Maenaddwyn, Mynydd Bodafon (Also the name of the highest point of the main island of Anglesey), Talwrn, Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd and Tregaian, and at the 2001 census had a population of 1,027. Churches Three of the community's churches are Grade II* listed. Saint Caian's Church at Tregaian dates from at least the 14th century, and contains a window from that period. The south doorway dates from the 15th century, and the pulpit contains 17th century panelling. The circular font dates from the 12th century. Saint Cwyllog's Church at Llangwyllog is thought to date from around 1200, and is mentioned in the Norwich Taxation of 1254, although the earliest dateable features are a doorway and window from the 15th century. The fittings are mainly from the late 18th century, and include a pulpit and reading desk. In the village of Llanddyfnan is Saint Dyfnan's Church, dating from the 14th century, and which includes a doorway to the nave with a two-centred head and carved nude figures. The churchyard includes the graves of some of the victims of the Royal Charter shipwreck of 1859. The ship, travelling from Melbourne to Liverpool with 371 passengers and 112 crew, was driven onto rocks at Moelfre by winds. Over 450 people died. The aftermath was reported by Charles Dickens in The Uncommercial Traveller, and the disaster led the Meteorological Office to introduce the first gale warnings.

Ginzburg (; born 1945) is a mathematical ecologist and the President of the firm Applied Biomathematics.  Biography  Lev Ginzburg was born in 1945 in Moscow, Russia, but grew up in St. Petersburg, at the time Leningrad. He studied mathematics and theoretical mechanics at Leningrad State University (M.S. in 1967) and received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the Agrophysical Research Institute in 1970. He worked at this Institute until the Spring of 1975 and emigrated to the United States in December 1975. After several months at the Accademia Nazionale Dei Lincei (Rome, Italy), and one year at the Mathematics Department at Northeastern University (Boston, MA), he was a professor at the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University from 1977 until his retirement in 2015. In 1982, Dr. Ginzburg founded and has since run Applied Biomathematics, a research and software firm focused on conservation biology, ecology, health, engineering and education. The company develops new methods for the assessment of risk and uncertainty in these areas.  Work  Applied Biomathematics is funded primarily by research grants and contracts from the U.S. government and private industry associations. Grants include awards from the National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Agriculture, NASA, National Science Foundation, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Other project funding has come from the Electric Power Research Institute and individual utility companies, healthcare, pharmaceutical and seed companies such as Pfizer, DuPont and Dow, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Research by Applied Biomathematics Applied Biomathematics translates theoretical concepts from biology and the physical sciences into new mathematical and statistical methods to quantitatively solve practical problems in these areas using risk analysis and reliability assessments.RAMAS: Technical software that anyone can use In 2001, Dr. Ginzburg testified in the U.S. Senate on the quantitative aspects of endangered species legislation. Dr. Ginzburg's work in risk analysis and applied ecology has been conducted at Applied Biomathematics in collaboration with Dr. Scott Ferson and Dr. Resit Akcakaya, who are now professors at the University of Liverpool, UK, and Stony Brook University, New York, USA respectively. The methods and RAMAS¬Æ software products developed by Applied Biomathematics are used by hundreds of academic institutions around the world, government agencies, and industrial and private labs in over 60 countries.Applied Biomathematics' Research Strengths Dr. Ginzburg‚Äôs most known academic work is a theory of predation (the ratio-dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg equations) that is an alternative to the classic prey-dependent Lotka-Volterra model. His book, with Roger Arditi, How Species Interact, summarizes their proposed alteration of the standard view. The recent editions of the standard college Ecology textbook devote equal space to the Lotka-Volterra and Arditi- Ginzburg equations. His concept of inertial growth or an explanation of population cycles, based upon maternal effect model, is the main point of his book written with Mark Colyvan, Ecological Orbits, and a more recent paper co- authored with Charley Krebs. His current interest is an evolutionary theory of non-adaptive selection (selective disappearance of unstable configurations). His book in progress (Non-Adaptive Selection, joint with John Damuth) relates to this area of research. The 2018 study has listed the 2004 Ginzburg and Jensen paper, \\"Rules of thumb for judging ecological theories\\" as one of the 100 must-reads in the history of Ecology, a selection out of half a million papers since Darwin.

Since her debut in 1982, Madonna's contributions to music, film, fashion, dance, and popular culture alongside with her attitude has influenced many other artists in the world. Her influence in the entertainment industry has generated extensive commentaries and analysis from critics, the media and public alike. Madonna's influence on artists is praised by most authors and historians, because when she emerged in the 80's, almost all the top artists in the world were men and bands, but after her, almost all would be female singers, with many critics saying that she still with the same status and unrivaled by any of her colleagues. This is one of the reasons why a range of authors (including Howard Kramer from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) commented that without her, \\"there would be no\\" many artists. Although Madonna took inspiration from other singers and people, music journalists from Billboard to MTV have commented that \\"she didn't follow anybody's formula\\" and \\"influenced herself\\". Some authors noted that \\"Madonna ends inevitably present in the lives of almost all the singers in the world, either at the beginning or end of the race\\", while others commenting that several \\"artists are more influenced by Madonna than any other artist past or present\\". Consistently voted and included on critic lists among the best or influential musicians of the history, academics and music critics have called Madonna the most successful, admired and influential female performer of all-time. Madonna, the most influential and successful female performer of all-time:  * She was ranked at number one on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Women in Music twice in 2012 (by the staff) and in 2002 (voted by the public). Madonna is officially certified by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling female recording artist of all time. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, Madonna is one of \\"the most emulated female performers in show business history\\". Generally, magazines and other publications compiled \\"lists of artists influenced by Madonna\\", who also are named \\"Madonna\\" as an honorific nickname.  Background  Marilyn Monroe, a major influence on Madonna's career. Madonna has taken inspiration from a number of entertainers, including Marilyn Monroe, Joni Mitchell, David Bowie, Patti Smith, Karen Carpenter, Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, and Aretha Franklin. She also includes in her work, inspiration from the Kabbalah, as well on gender stereotypes, sexual clich√©s, corporate monoliths, and religious ones. Billboard editor M. Tye Comer said: \\"Although Madonna had her influences, she created her own unmistakable style. She wrote her own ticket; she didn't have to follow anybody's formula. She declared who she was ... and took possession of her music\\". Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that \\"she's influenced others and even herself\\". Richard P√©rez-Feria from HuffPost said that Madonna took influences to guide her, but she never came off as derivate. She borrowed, sure, but she always \\"Madonnaized\\" it. Contrary, he noted that \\"Madonna‚Äôs younger musical contemporaries have liberally taken from her\\". Explaining the inspiration that she takes from other cultures, Madonna said in an interview with The Huffington Post in 2015, that is \\"our job as artists, to turn the world upside down and make everyone feel bewildered and have to rethink everything\\". She commented: \\"I‚Äôm inspired and I‚Äôm referencing other cultures. That is my right as an artist. They said Elvis Presley stole African-American culture\\". The singer later concluded that both \\"have a right to be \\"inspired\\" by other cultures\\".  Context and analysis  Since the beginning of her career, Madonna has clearly inspired many female artists. Ian Youngs of BBC News explained that \\"her influence on others has come as much from her image as her music, with her no-nonsense, boundary-pushing persona showing other artists what could be achieved\\". Rolling Stone concluded that we can see \\"her influence in the recent generations of artists who have picked up some of her moves and have been influenced by her style\\". World Music Awards declared that Madonna \\"inspired every struggling young singer/actor/dancer with a dream\\". In a general perspective, T. Cole Rachel of Pitchfork said that \\"it is not hyperbole to say that Madonna profoundly influenced the ways in which an entire generation of people thought about music, fashion, and‚Äîin particular‚Äîsex\\". Madonna's influence on pop stars has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. When Time magazine included her in the list of the \\"25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century\\", they pointed that \\"every pop star of the last two to three decades has Madonna to thank in some part for his or her success\\". Similar thoughts were from professor Mary Cross, who wrote in her book Madonna: a biography that \\"her influence on pop music is undeniable and far reaching\\". Also, she explained that new pop icons owe Madonna a debt of thanks for the template she forged, \\"combining provocative sexiness and female power in her image, music, and lyrics\\". Author Kimberly Potts said: \\"No other female pop star in history has had the musical, music video, concert tour, and fashion influence that Madonna has had, and continues to have, in the past three ‚Äîcontinuining into a fourth‚Äî deacade\\". Editor Erik Thompson from City Pages expressed that \\"any current pop-tartlet that denies that Madonna is an influence or an inspiration to them is either lying or simply ignorant of music history. T√∫ magazine staff from Televisa, commented: Biographer Fouz- Hern√°ndez explained that female pop performers such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez and Pink were like \\"Madonna's daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her\\". Ottawa Sun editor Aedan Helmer wrote: \\"It would be easy to quantify her influence by the generations of pop stars created and groomed in her self- made image ‚Äîwithout Madonna, the 'Britneys' and 'Katys' of the world simply wouldn‚Äôt exist\\". Merely Me from website HealthCentral expressed that \\"there would be no Britney Spears or Lady Gaga without Madonna\\". She also wrote that \\"her influence is seen in the fashion, style and songs of many of the female pop stars of today\\". As Helmer and Merely Me, Rick Florino from Artist Direct felt: Madonna in 2015. Authors also compared Madonna's influence with other contemporary artists and praised her longevity, especially in the context in which she thrived because when she emerged in the 80's, almost the top artists in the world were men and bands, but after her, almost all would be female singers. Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum said: \\"There was no one like her before\\". Retrospectively, Gillian Branstetter from The Daily Dot felt that even with other female artists in scene, Madonna reached a superstar status unrivaled by any of her colleagues. She said that \\"Madonna is the only performer still standing of the Generation X\\". Helmer from Ottawa Sun named her \\"the most vital performer of her generation\\". Writing for MSNBC in August 2008, Tony Sclafani felt that \\"her influence on pop music has outshone that of the Beatles\\". Editor Art Tavana from website Death & Taxes (owned by Prometheus Global Media) compared the singer with Michael Jackson and said that \\"Madonna‚Äôs overall impact on pop culture far outweighs that of Jackson\\" and explained that artists like Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake and Usher were influenced by Jackson more than her, but \\"almost everyone else is a reductive reissue of Madonna\\". Author continues and said that other artists are more influenced by Madonna than any other artist past or present. In his 2008 article, Craig Takeuchi from The Georgia Straight compared the influence since the 1980 years between Madonna and Janet Jackson and commented that with her personality, Madonna \\"went far further with it than anyone else did or ever has\\". Takeuchi explained that \\"she was at her most influential whenever she relied on her instincts\\".  Legacy   Media attention  Latin Madonna\\", an honorific nickname used by the media to describe extraordinarily successful artists Many artists have been inspired by and compared to Madonna. Is common to see critics lists naming artists influenced by her. The Daily Telegraphs William Langley wrote that she is permanent fixture on every list of \\"world's most powerful/admired/influential women\\". Also, naming \\"Madonna\\" to other performers became in an honorific nickname adopted by the international media. Generally are artists heavily influenced by her and some examples can be the \\"Mexican Madonna\\" (Selena, Yuri or Gloria Trevi), The Mexican Madonna:  the \\"Latin Madonna\\" (Gloria Estefan, Jennifer Lopez, Thal√≠a, Paulina Rubio or Shakira),The Latin Madonna:  or the \\"Black Madonna\\" (Rihanna and Beyonc√©). The Black Madonna:  Several of those artists who have been inspired heavily by Madonna are known by the press as \\"the heirs of Madonna\\" or her \\"musical daughters\\". Madonna's heirs: * * For example, in 2013 MTV Latin America makes a call vote What is the heir to the queen of pop?. Rolling Stone cited of Britney to Lady Gaga, passing by Rihanna and Christina. Named \\"the modern day Madonna\\" by Guinness World Records, some authors have referred to Britney Spears as the \\"heir\\" of Madonna, Britney Spears heiress Madonna' * * and others like Us Weekly Staff said her heir \\"apparent\\" is Lady Gaga. Among them, Madonna's influence was most notable in Spears, who has been called \\"her prot√©g√©\\". In her case, Gwen Stefani responded that \\"some people say that I copy her. But show me one girl my age who was not influenced by her.\\" She has been referred to as \\"the new Madonna\\" by publications such as The Hollywood Reporter and People. Ann Powers from NPR Music commented that \\"Madonna, is doing turning the world's attention to her heirs.\\" Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine felt that \\"Madonna is aware of the influence she has on the heirs to her crown, but does not rate them highly\\". Argentine journalist Rodrigo Fres√°n said: \\"We think of the Madonnas that to come as we think on science fiction that is becoming less fiction and allow ourselves to imagine Madonna's clones.\\"  Impact and response  Madonna is often called \\"the most admired or influential female performer of all-time\\", by authors, critics, the public and academics alike. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as one of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, and other people who have in some major way influenced the music industry. However, when was announced as the Billboard's 2016 Woman of the Year, Janice Min said that the singer \\"is one of a minuscule number of super-artists whose influence and career transcend music\\". Telcel company named her \\"the most influential female artist\\" and explained that \\"since her appearance on the music scene in 1983, no artist has called more the attention that Madonna\\". Sclafani explained that a quarter century after Madonna emerged, \\"artists still use her ideas and seem modern and edgy doing so\\". According to BET, Madonna is recognized by many as \\"the most successful and influential woman in American music history, with Branstetter saying that her influence on American pop music \\"is almost smothering in its totality\\". More than any other female singer in history, Madonna is cited as the artist that paved the way for virtually every female musician, and the artist that changed the role of women in music. Branstetter wrote that in this way, \\"Madonna fundamentally altered all that comes after her and nearly embarrassing all that came before\\". Authors Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti felt that she \\"changed everything the musical landscape\\". Kramer also commented: \\"Today's more-flamboyant female pop stars enjoy the freedom to make music and perform the way they do, but they didn't create that freedom. Madonna did the moving and shaking when she burst onto the pop-music charts in the early '80s\\". He further asserted that \\"Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow... She certainly raised the standards of all of them... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers\\".  Influenced by Madonna   Definitions  Black Madonna\\". Beyonc√© said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. Britney Spears cited Madonna a major influence on her. Was called \\"the modern day Madonna\\" by Guinness World Records. Paulina Rubio has cited Madonna saying, \\"I am inspired by her warrior spirit.\\". Taylor Swift has cited Madonna's constant reinvention of her image as inspirational.

He was famous for being charming and unruffled. He was relentless in his pursuit of a case, with a great knowledge of the law, and something of a gift for rhetoric.‚ÄôHandsome Brute‚Äô by Sean O‚Äôconnor Biography Casswell was born in Wimbledon,General Register Office UK:- 1886 Birth: Mar Qtr, CASSWELL, Joshua David, in Kingston, vol 2a, page 320 the son of Joshua Joyce Casswell and Sarah Tate. He was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford University, gaining an honours degree in Jurisprudence in 1909. He was called to the bar in 1910. Casswell served in World War I as a major, and was mentioned in dispatches in 1916, before being invalided home in 1917. He married Irene fitzroy Hutton in 1919 and had three sons and one daughter.'Who Was Who, 1961-1970  The Titanic case  In 1913, Casswell acted in a case against the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, which owned the White Star Line, in relation to the sinking of the Titanic. The outcome was that several relatives of passengers who had drowned were awarded ¬£100 each in compensation, when the jury found that the captain had been negligent.‚ÄôHandsome Brute‚Äô by Sean O‚Äôconnor Rattenbury In 1935, Casswell acted for George Percy Stoner, a Bournemouth chauffeur, who was accused of murdering his employer, the architect Francis Rattenbury. The case gathered public attention because the other suspect, Rattenbury‚Äôs pretty young wife Alma, committed suicide shortly after the murder, leading to a suspicion that Stoner had taken the blame for her. He was, in the end reprieved from a death sentence.‚ÄôHandsome Brute‚Äô by Sean O‚Äôconnor The Cleft Chin Murder Casswell acted for Elizabeth Marina Jones, in 1944, in possibly his most well-known case. Jones and her boyfriend, Karl Hulten, who had deserted from the US Army, indulged in a campaign of violence ending in the death of a taxi driver. Hulten was executed, but Casswell secured Jones‚Äô life and she was released in 1954. The case prompted George Orwell to write an essay ‚ÄòDecline of the English Murder‚Äô.‚ÄôHandsome Brute‚Äô by Sean O‚Äôconnor Neville Heath In 1946, Casswell‚Äôs attentions returned to Bournemouth, which had been the scene of the gruesome murder of Doreen Marshall by Neville Heath. Heath had also killed Margery Gardener, and there was discussion as to which murder should be the basis of his trial. Doreen Marshall‚Äôs murder had been so brutal that the prosecution felt it opened the door to a defence plea of insanity, so he was tried for Margery Gardner‚Äôs killing. In court the debate focussed on the question of whether or not Heath was in his right mind.‚ÄôHandsome Brute‚Äô by Sean O‚Äôconnor By the end of his career, Casswell had defended 40 people accused of murder, and had saved all but five of them from execution.

Neu?, recorded during their 1996 Japanese tour at a concert in Tokyo. Despite its title, the album actually consists of the first half of the concert, the second half having been released in 1998 as Cha Cha 2000 - Live in Tokyo 1996 Vol. 1. The album consists of a mixture of live improvisation and set songs, including some sampled material from English musician Mick Lount. Background to tour In early 1996 Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother met in D√ºsseldorf to review their ongoing legal battle with Metronome Records for the rights to the three original Neu! albums which they made together in the 1970s. Metronome had offered to compromise with Dinger and Rother by giving the two musicians a sizable proportion of the profits made from a reissue of the albums and by financing promotional activities, possibly including a world tour. Whilst Dinger was willing to accept this offer, Rother was more hesitant, still hoping to secure full ownership of the recordings. In the meantime, Dinger spoke to Ken Matsutani (the head of Captain Trip Records which was at that time releasing Dinger's post-Neu! back catalogue), and Matsutani began looking for venues in Japan for the upcoming tour. Matsutani discovered two venues which were interested in hosting Neu! - Muse Hall in Osaka and On Air West in Tokyo. In early 1996 Cluster (a band associated with Neu! and particularly with Michael Rother) had visited both venues as part of a world tour and produced the album Japan 1996 Live from the result. Dinger and Neu! (like Cluster) had a comparatively large following in Japan, and it was anticipated that any Neu! concerts arranged would be well attended. Michael Rother was unwilling to commit to a tour, however, much to Dinger's annoyance. Rather than back out of the conversations he was having with Tokyo and Osaka, Dinger decided to offer the services of a new group he had been building around Andreas Reihse of Kreidler and Victoria Wehrmeister of Superbilk. In reference to Neu! and La D√ºsseldorf he named the new band La! Neu?, and was quickly accepted by owner of the venues - Hirokazu Nambu (Dinger admitted that Nambu was taking a \\"risk\\"\\"Cha Cha 2000 - Live in Tokyo Vol. 1\\" CD booklet in inviting the unknown La! Neu?). In Germany he finalised the group's debut album D√ºsseldorf and prepared to take an extended 8-man line-up with him to Japan. In the summer of 1996 Dinger was consumed with the organisation (by mail and fax) of an exhibition of his visual art in Auckland, New Zealand. Kerry Aberhard - the curator of the art gallery and a fan of Dinger's work - offered to fly to Japan in advance of La! Neu? to assist the group during their tour. Tour and concert setting In late November 1996, Kerry Aberhard flew to Osaka and was met on 1 December by Ken Matsutani and members of Matsutani's band \\"Marble Sheep\\" (who had travelled from Tokyo). They \\"filled time drinking scotch in [Kerry's hotel] room\\"CD booklet until Dinger and La! Neu? were due to arrive later that day. At 8:30 PM Aberhard and Marble Sheep travelled to the airport to meet La! Neu?, whose flight was slightly delayed. This was the first time Dinger had met his label head face-to-face, and the first time he had been to Japan. They stayed overnight in Osaka (where it was snowing heavily) and performed at Muse Hall on 2 December. The stage had a rope stretched at shoulder-height across it, from which hung Japanese drums and bells which Dinger played during the concert along with his guitar. He was joined by drummers Thomas Klein and Markus Hofmann (both of Kreidler) as well as bassist and contrabassist Konstantin Wienstroer, guitarist Dirk Flader, vocalist Victoria Wehrmeister and keyboardists Andreas Reihse and Rembrandt Lensink. The concert went well, featuring much the same set list as the Tokyo concert. The following day, the entourage travelled to On Air West, Tokyo, arriving slightly behind schedule. The stage was set up in much the same way as in Osaka, with the addition of a 3m square La! Neu? banner created by artist Yuri Shibata. Before the concert the band dined on noodles. Concert tickets bore the cryptic legend \\"Psychedelic Originators For Space Age Vol. 6\\",CD booklet and sold well. Album content and performance The album begins with a short sample of a conversation between Ken Matsutani and Klaus Dinger in transit from Osaka to Tokyo. This is followed on by a lengthier sound-piece recorded as La! Neu? arrived at On Air West. It features conversations in English between Dinger and various Japanese venue staff and fans, as well as the sound of Victoria Wehrmeister conducting a sound check on the vocal microphones. The concert proper begins with \\"Tension\\", a quiet track largely consisting of Rembrandt Lensink's keyboard improvisations. After six minutes \\"Viva\\" begins without warning; the band evidently attempting to surprise the audience. \\"Viva\\" is extended to 15 minutes and features a new vocal melody sung by Wehrmeister. After \\"Viva\\", Dinger addresses the audience for the first time, saying‚Äî Dinger then plays another audio-trick on the audience by turning off a loud synthesizer hiss, which had built up over the previous song without the audience realising. The end of \\"Hero '96\\" segues into a lengthy jam called \\"East West Special\\", which includes complicated tape manipulation, so at times the song is playing over a recording of itself. This, in turn, segues into the next track - \\"Anti-Rapman\\" - in which Dinger uses a preset keyboard rhythm to back more tape manipulation, commenting of the keyboard rhythm: \\"that should be forbidden, I find it horrid\\".Track: \\"Free in Tokyo B: Anti-Rapman\\", disc 2 Rembrandt Lensink's keyboard improvisations lead in to \\"Message from California\\". In 1993 Dinger was sent a tape by English musician Mick Lount, who had encountered Neu! and La D√ºsseldorf whilst living in Germany as a teenager. Lount had moved to New Zealand in the 1980s, where he met Kerry Aberhard. On the release of Die Engel des Herrn in 1992 Aberhard introduced it to Lount. Soon afterwards Lount moved to Santa Clara, California with his girlfriend, and from there sent Dinger the tape, which includes an audio message of Lount speaking as well as several songs recorded by Lount. During \\"Message from California\\" Dinger plays Lount's tape to the audience; primarily the 'message' part, in which Lount explains who he is and why he is sending the tape. A short snippets of Lount's song \\"Arkesden\\" and one other song are also played, with added tape effects and ambient drones provided by La! Neu?. Eventually Dinger fades out the tape, leaving the synthesizer drones, which make up the next track - \\"Rheinarita\\". This is followed by live versions of Dinger's songs \\"Mayday\\" (from D√ºsseldorf) and \\"America\\" (from Neondian). Following on from these at the concert was \\"Cha Cha 2000\\", which is covered by the first volume of the album. Track listing All tracks composed by Klaus Dinger, except where indicated.

Ampelographers believe that the grape originated in the Cognac-producing wine region of the Charente and may be named after the commune of Balzac, Charente. The first written mention of Balzac blanc was by in 1842 when it was listed as one of the grape varieties growing around La Rochelle in the nearby Charente- Maritime department. It was believed that the grape was a color mutation of Mourv√®dre but DNA profiling at the turn of the 21st century showed that Balzac blanc was actually a natural crossing of the Loire wine grape Chenin blanc and the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc.

Holdre manor As a landed estate, the manor of Holdre () has a history that goes back to at least 1597. Throughout most of its history, the manor was owned by different aristocratic Baltic German families. During the Soviet occupation of Estonia, it was used by the Young Pioneer Organization of the Soviet Union. The main building of the manor house was modernized in about 1910 by Woldemar von Ditmar. It was built to the design of Otto Wildau, a Riga-based architect who also designed the nearby Taagepera Castle and in a similar style: Art Nouveau with heavy influences from Finnish National Romanticism. The likeness between the two manors is perhaps because the owner of Holdre estate at the time, Ditmar, was the brother-in-law of the landowner at Sangaste, Hugo von Stryk.

It belongs to a diverse group of Triassic temnospondyls called Capitosauria. The type species Warrenisuchus aliciae was erected in 2009. W. aliciae was originally described as a species of Parotosuchus in 1988, which is known from other species that have been found in Europe, Africa, and Antarctica. In 2000 it was then assigned to a new genus called Rewanobatrachus along with the newly named species R. gunganj, which was declared the type species of the genus. However, R. gunganj was later reclassified as a species of Watsonisuchus, invalidating the name Rewanobatrachus and requiring that R. aliciae be placed in its own genus, which was named Warrenisuchus. However, several studies suggest that Warrenisuchus aliciae may be a species of Watsonisuchus as well. Unlike most capitosaurs, Warrenisuchus is known from many juvenile skulls less than in length. Description Warrenisuchus is known from several fossil specimens. The holotype skeleton preserves most of the skull and lower jaws, the pectoral girdle, the forward-most vertebrae and ribs, and the right hind limb and the paratype specimen includes a partial skull and pectoral girdle. All known specimens of Warrenisuchus are very small; the largest skull is only long and the smallest is long (adult capitosaurs can have skulls over a meter in length). They show many characteristics of juvenile individuals such as large eye sockets, rounded heads (adult capitosaurs typically have triangular heads), loose joints between skull bones, small tabular horns, and pineal foramina close to the back of the eye sockets (as opposed to farther back on the skull table). The smallest specimens seem to represent the stage of development immediately after metamorphosis when gills have been lost and the skull bones have thickened but the vertebrae remain poorly developed. Classification Phylogeny Below is a cladogram from Maganuco et al. (2009): Paleoenvironment Warrenisuchus fossils are the most common components of an amphibian fauna that existed in eastern Australia during the Early Triassic. They are preserved in the Arcadia Formation, which dates back to the Induan stage. Other temnospondyl amphibians from the Arcadia Formation include rhytidosteids and brachyopoids. Another amphibian fauna existed around the same time in western Australia and includes a greater diversity of brachyopoids along with rhytidosteids, trematosaurids, and the capitosaur Edingerella, which was a close relative of Warrenisuchus.

Pragyananda, Mahapragya and Shakyananda in Kalimpong in circa 1935. Dhammalok, expelled in 1944. The banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal was part of a campaign by the Rana government to suppress the resurgence of Theravada Buddhism in Nepal in the early the 20th century. There were two deportations of monks from Kathmandu, in 1926 and 1944. The exiled monks were the first group of monks to be seen in Nepal since the 14th century. They were at the forefront of a movement to revive Theravada Buddhism, which had disappeared from the country more than five hundred years before. Newar Buddhism is traditionally Vajrayana based. The Rana dynasty disapproved of Buddhism and the Newar language. It saw the activities of the monks and their growing following as a threat. When police harassment and imprisonment failed to deter the monks, all of whom were Newars, they were deported. Among the charges made against them were preaching a new faith, converting Hindus, encouraging women to renounce and thereby undermining family life, and writing books in Newari.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. , . Page 48. Expulsion of 1926 In 1926, five monks along with their Tibetan guru Tsering Norbu were expelled from the country. These five monks, whose Dharma names were Bauddha Rishi Mahapragya, Mahaviryya, Mahachandra, Mahakhanti and Mahagnana, had been ordained under the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. The government objected to Mahapragya, who was born a Hindu, converting to Buddhism and the monks making alms rounds in Kathmandu. The police arrested the monks and jailed and questioned them. The case went up to the prime minister, Chandra Shumsher JBR, who ordered their banishment. They were given a few days to beg for provisions under the condition that they return to the police station to sleep. Then they were marched to the Indian border under police escort. The five monks and their teacher first went to Bodh Gaya, India, from where they scattered, some of them going to Burma and Tibet. Expulsion of 1944 In 1944, another group of eight monks were sent into exile. Their Dharma names were Pragyananda Mahasthavir, Dhammalok Mahasthavir, Subhodhananda, Pragyarashmi, Pragyarasa, Ratnajyoti, Agga Dhamma and Kumar Kashyap Mahasthavir. This time they were accused of encouraging women to renounce Hinduism and writing in Newari. The monks were summoned before the prime minister Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana and ordered to sign a pledge that they would stop their activities. When they refused, they were ordered out of the country. The monks went to Kushinagar and then Sarnath in India. There they founded Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching) which worked to promote Buddhism and published religious literature from exile. Some of the monks remained in India while others went to Tibet, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Bhaju Ratna Kansakar, a Nepalese merchant based in Kalimpong, was one of their largest supporters in exile. Return from exile In 1946, a Sri Lankan goodwill mission visited Kathmandu and interceded on behalf of the monks. The delegation emphasized that Nepal was the birthplace of Buddha, and that his followers should be free to practice their faith in the country where he was born. Subsequently, the ban was lifted and the monks returned and devoted themselves to spreading the faith with greater energy. Page 7. In 1951, the Rana regime was ousted by a revolution and democracy established in Nepal. With democracy, overt persecution of Buddhists ended.

The original form of the headband was worn in late fifteenth-century Italy, and was rechristened a ferronni√®re at the time of its revival in the second quarter of the nineteenth century for both day and (more frequently) formal and evening wear. Etymology The term ferronni√®re for describing such headbands was probably coined in the early nineteenth century. Merriam-Webster date the earliest use of the term to 1831, and the Oxford English Dictionary notes that their record of the earliest usage of the term is located in a mid-19th-century publication called World of Fashion. Some sources suggest that the term was contemporary to the 1490s. The ferronni√®re is often said to be named after a 1490s portrait attributed to the school of Leonardo da Vinci, the La belle ferronni√®re, where the sitter wears such an ornament. However, this painting's title was assigned in the 18th century, well after it was painted, under the erroneous assumption that it portrayed Madame Le F√©ron, a reputed mistress of Francis I of France; or another mistress who was allegedly an iron merchant's wife. The literal translation of ferronni√®re in English is \\"ironmonger.\\" In their catalogue, the Louvre suggest that La belle ferronni√®re was so-called because of her forehead ornament, a theory that is supported by other scholars, but other sources conclude that the ornament was named after the painting, due to the term's specific application apparently not existing prior to the 19th century. In fashion The original ornament that later became called a ferronni√®re was popular in 15th-century Italy, where it could be made from metal or jewels. The nineteenth-century ferronni√®re was worn from the late 1820s to the early 1840s, when it was considered to enhance a high forehead, and by the 1850s, it had fallen out of fashion. One contemporary source from 1831 describes the ferronni√®re as \\"a small plait of hair, adorned in the centre of the forehead by a large brilliant, from which depends another brilliant of the pear shape.\\" It has been described as one of the most widely worn examples of historicism in early Victorian fashion, worn as a tribute to the Renaissance alongside beaded belts called cordeli√®res inspired by medieval clothing and hairstyles named after historic women such as Agn√®s Sorel and Blanche of Castile. The ferronni√®re could be worn for either day or evening. Alternative terms for similar ornaments were the bandelette and the tour de t√™te.

Written by Toby Gad and Olivia Waithe, and produced by Gad, \\"The War Is Over\\" is a ballad that tells of a resolute ending to a relationship between lovers, in which the woman, after seeing that their relationship is turbulent beyond repair, decides to walk away. Upon its release, \\"The War Is Over\\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, whose criticism targeted the song's lyrical content, but also complimented her somber vocal performance. Fueled by digital sales during Strongers release, the song entered South Korean Singles Chart at number 65. Clarkson has also performed it in limited live performances, primarily in select dates of her Stronger Tour.  Background and release  Originally titled \\"The War Is Over (You Don‚Äôt Deserve Me)\\", \\"The War Is Over\\" was written by Toby Gad and Olivia Waithe (better known by her stage name as Livvi Franc) and was produced by Gad. Gad first met Clarkson in 2010, in which he recalled, \\"She's a very strong survivor, and very organic and very real,\\" he said. \\"You can connect with her on a very human level.\\" Clarkson revealed the it was the first song to be recorded for her fifth studio album, Stronger, which was released in 2011. She explained: > \\"It's actually one, I didn't write, but it's actually the first song we > recorded for this record because everybody loved it. It tells a beautiful > story that everybody relates to.

I'm not going to recognize the negativity.\\" In October 20, 2011, Clarkson premiered \\"The War Is Over\\" in her YouTube channel to prevent it from leaking. An acoustic version of the track also appears on her debut extended play, The Smoakstack Sessions (2011).  Composition  Written in the key of G Major, \\"The War Is Over\\" is a midtempo ballad with throbbing drums and various layered vocals. Its lyrics tell of a resolute ending to a relationship between lovers, in which the woman, after seeing that their relationship is strained and incorrigible, decides to leave it. Gad pointed out that song presents a coda to a romantic relationship or to an actual war. He remarked, \\"That's the underlying theme for her, to vent emotions that we all feel in our relationships.\\" Clarkson also revealed about its musical's content: \\"I think there‚Äôs always going to be that level with me. That‚Äôs the type of music I love. I grew up loving feisty women singers. I find a lot of joy in getting all that crap out of your system. I haven‚Äôt been in a bad relationship in years. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been in a bad relationship, and I think when you‚Äôre singing any song like that, you pull from the one thing in your life that you know you‚Äôve experienced.\\"  Critical response  \\"The War Is Over\\" has received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Sam Lansky of PopCrush compared the song to Clarkson's 2009 single, \\"Already Gone\\", he added, \\"When Clarkson sings, ‚ÄúAll I can say is / You don‚Äôt deserve me / You don‚Äôt deserve me,‚Äù it‚Äôs hard not to get a little misty.\\" Jason Scott of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote in his review: \\"Sure, Clarkson demonstrates her haunted soul, but she makes it clear that she's the one doing the walking away. \\"You don't deserve me,\\" she concludes over the bridge. The thing that makes this track interesting is that Clarkson has taken her pain (and previous breakup songs) and churned out a lyrical improvement and more mature take. It goes without saying that her vocals are on point, and she makes sure to choose specific moments to drive forward and pull back.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote in his review, \\"she even dips her toe into brooding My December territory on ‚ÄúThe War Is Over‚Äù.\\" Brian Mansfield of USA Today offered a mixed review, he wrote, \\"You know the bad thing about relationships on Kelly Clarkson albums? Even when they break up, they never end. Either Kelly lets the memory of the guy live rent-free inside her head, or, as is the case here, the guy keeps after her and she keeps swearing she's walking away, but she never actually leaves. It's like the couples are stuck in some eternal limbo where they're never together but they're never quite free of each other.\\" Eric Danton of the Hartford Courant also offered a mixed review: \\"A stab at weary resignation on \\"The War is Over\\" belabors the battlefield conceit, though the song also makes a point it didn't intend to make: Clarkson doesn't need a bunch of lyrical frippery to be great. She's a star, sure, but the one-time cocktail waitress from Fort Worth doesn't seem like the sort to express herself through eye-rolling combat analogies.\\" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard was puzzled about his lyrics, he wrote: \\"Another defiant track marked by its pummeling drums.

Butcher (January 24, 1856 - March 18, 1927) was an itinerant photographer who spent most of his life in central Nebraska, in the Great Plains region of the United States. A settler under the Homestead Act, he began in 1886 to produce a photographic record of the history of white settlement in the region. Over 3,000 of his negatives survive; more than 1,000 of these depict sod houses. Butcher wrote two books incorporating his photographs: Pioneer History of Custer County and Short Sketches of Early Days in Nebraska (1901), and Sod Houses, or the Development of the Great American Plains (1904). Butcher was unable to achieve financial success as a farmer, as a photographer, or in a number of other schemes later in his life, and at the time of his death felt that he had been a failure. However, the number and scope of his photographs of Nebraska pioneer life have made them a valuable resource to students of that period of history, and they have become a staple of historical texts and popular works alike. His oeuvre has been described as \\"the most important chronicle of the saga of homesteading in America\\". Early life Solomon D. Butcher was born on January 24, 1856, the oldest child of Thomas Jefferson Butcher and Esther (Ullom) Butcher, in Burton in Wetzel County, in what was then the state of Virginia but later became part of West Virginia. In 1860, his family moved to LaSalle County, Illinois, where his father worked for the Illinois Central Railroad. The family remained there for nearly twenty years. Butcher finished high school in 1874 and was briefly apprenticed to a tintypist, who taught him the business of photography. In the winter term of 1875-76, he attended the Henry Military School in Henry, Illinois. He then worked as a travelling salesman for a firm in Clyde, Ohio until 1880. In 1880, Thomas Jefferson Butcher announced that he was leaving his secure job with the railroad and moving west, to establish a homestead in Custer County, Nebraska. Although Solomon Butcher had a good job, he had grown tired of his work, and \\"had already thought seriously of seeking my fortune in the great west\\". In March 1880, a party consisting of Butcher, his father, his brother George, and his brother-in-law J. R. Wabel started westward in two covered wagons. After seven weeks, they arrived in northeastern Custer County, where they occupied homesteads near the north bank of the Middle Loup River, west-northwest of present-day Sargent. The party began construction of a sod house, and Butcher quickly came to rue his decision to go west: \\"I soon came to the conclusion that any man that would leave the luxuries of a boarding house, where they had hash every day, and a salary of $125 a month to lay Nebraska sod for 75 cents a day... was a fool.\\" Upon the completion of the house, Butcher and his father returned to Illinois to bring his mother and his youngest brother to Nebraska. However, Butcher did not return with them: he stayed in Illinois for several months, returning to Nebraska with only three days left to construct a dwelling on his homestead; failure to do so would mean forfeiting his claim. Butcher, his father, and two of his brothers built and occupied a dugout, saving the claim. Two weeks later, however, he once again went back east, moving to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and abandoning his homestead. \\"I would not have remained and kept batch for five years for the whole of Custer county,\\" he declared. Lillie Butcher, ca. 1901 Butcher attended medical college in Minneapolis in the winter and spring of 1881-2\\\\. There, he met Lillie M. (Barber) Hamilton, a young widow working as a nurse at the hospital. The two were married in May 1882. Soon thereafter, Butcher once again decided that the West was the place for him. \\"I had just seen enough of the wild west to unfit me for living contentedly in the East\\", he wrote. In October 1882, the couple returned to Custer County, where they moved in with his father. During that winter, he worked as a schoolteacher. Photographer on the Plains Butcher was able to save some of his teacher's salary, and to borrow enough more to open the first photography studio in Custer County. The studio was housed in a lath-and-adobe building, measuring , with a dirt floor and with cotton sheeting in lieu of glass to cover the windows and the skylights. As a backdrop for the photos, he used an old cloth wagon cover. The cloth had been gnawed by rats and was full of holes, which Lillie patched. To keep the patches from showing up in photographs, Butcher attached two coil springs from an old bed to the ceiling, then hung the backdrop from them. Before taking a picture, he plucked the backdrop so that it oscillated on the springs; the motion, combined with the long exposure time required, blurred the backdrop so that the patches would not be visible in the photograph. Photography alone was not enough to pay the bills. Butcher opened a post office in his studio, which he named \\"Jefferson\\" after his father. This proved less than lucrative: his postal income came from stamp cancellations, and in the first three months amounted to 68 cents. He also did farm work for his father, at a wage of 50 to 75 cents per day. In December 1884, the town of Walworth was established near Butcher's homestead. Butcher, his wife, and their two children moved there and built a sod house. In Walworth, Butcher found a business partner, A. W. Darling, who supplied the money to put up a frame building for a studio. However, Walworth did not last: it had been established at a time when rains had been unusually good, and the resumption of normal dry conditions led to the town's demise. Butcher's family had to leave their sod house after six weeks of residence. He and Darling were forced to sell their building, which was moved to the town of West Union; there, they rented it for five years. Pioneer History In the spring of 1886, Butcher conceived the idea of writing an illustrated history of Custer County. This, he thought, would be the key to fame and riches. \\"At last, Eureka! Eureka! I had found it. I was so elated that I lost all desire for rest and had to take morphine to make me sleep.\\" To embark upon this project, he needed financing. Unlike Butcher, his father had succeeded as a farmer, running a gristmill and a freighting business as well; it was to him that Butcher turned for assistance. Thomas Jefferson Butcher was initially skeptical; but after his son had arranged to photograph 75 homesteads, he agreed to provide a team and wagon for the project. Butcher, ca. 1886 In June 1886, Butcher took the first photograph for the book. He met a certain amount of skepticism--\\"Some called me a fool, others a crank...\\" He began his work only thirteen years after the establishment of the first homestead in the county, when it could hardly be said to have a history. He persevered: from 1886 to 1892, he took over 1,500 photographs and recorded over 1,500 narratives. Hard times struck Custer County in the early 1890s. Crops failed in 1890; good crops in the following two years were offset by low prices. The harvest was small in 1893, and the spring and summer of 1894 were almost entirely devoid of rain. The county also partook of the nationwide depression that began with the Panic of 1893. Butcher was an early victim of this agricultural and economic collapse: in 1892, he lost his farm, and was forced to suspend his history project. The Populist Party and its predecessor, the Farmers' Alliance, were strong in Custer County in the 1890s, carrying elections for a decade beginning in 1889. Butcher attached himself to the movement and, in 1896, was elected Justice of the Peace and Clerk of the Election for West Union. Rising farm prices and a generally improving economy allowed him to secure a home and to get himself nearly out of debt, and in 1899 he was about to resume work on the history. In 1899, however, Butcher's house burned down, destroying its entire contents, including the pioneer narratives and the photographic prints. Fortunately for the history project, the glass negatives were stored in a granary, and escaped the fire. The house had carried no insurance, however, and Butcher was once again left penniless. Butcher persevered, again setting himself to the task of compiling pioneer narratives. He secured the assistance of George B. Mair, the editor of the Callaway Chronicle, in editing these accounts and in preparing the manuscript. To cover the cost of engraving, typesetting, and publishing, he recruited Ephraim Swain Finch, an early settler of Custer County and now a wealthy rancher. Finch, whom Butcher knew through his Populist activities, agreed to underwrite these expenses; moreover, he placed an advertisement in the Custer County Chief, assuring readers that orders for Butcher's forthcoming book would be filled. Broken Bow, 1886 Orders for the book began flowing in. The first edition of 1000 copies sold out before its delivery date, in the summer of 1901; a second printing, of either 500 or 1000 copies, was issued before Christmas of that year. The book, titled Pioneer History of Custer County and Short Sketches of Early Days in Nebraska, included 200 engravings in its more than 400 pages. Later career Encouraged by the success of Pioneer History, Butcher began planning similar photographic histories of Buffalo and Dawson counties, which border Custer County on the south. He moved to Kearney, the county seat of Buffalo County, in 1902; there, he opened a photography studio together with his son Lynn. He roamed more widely still, through Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming; carrying his equipment in a wagon, he made negatives on the site, then shipped these to Kearney, where Lynn and several women employees made the prints and mailed them back to the customers. Butcher pere et fils also ran a postcard business, making over 2 million cards for the local trade. In 1904, he published a second book, Sod Houses; or, The Development of the Great American Plains, at the urging of a lawyer who hoped to use Butcher's photographs and accounts to sell land in Nebraska. In 1909, he visited Yellowstone National Park and produced a set of 100 stereographic postcards. Butcher abandoned the history of Buffalo and Dawson counties after spending more than a thousand dollars on the project. Discontented with his profession as photographer, which had failed to make him a fortune or even to put him on a sound financial footing, he turned his efforts elsewhere. In 1911, he turned the Kearney studio over to his son and began work as an agent for the Standard Land Company. He gave stereopticon lectures throughout Buffalo and Dawson counties promoting the company's irrigated lands in south Texas, and made plans to move there himself. Butcher photo: Frederic Schreyer and family, Custer County, 1880s. Before he could move, however, he had to dispose of his thousands of glass-plate negatives. He also had to get himself out of debt once again. In an attempt to accomplish both of these at once, he offered his collection of negatives to the Nebraska State Historical Society. To Addison Sheldon, head of the Society's Legislative Reference Bureau, he wrote, \\"Now is the time to buy me cheap, when I need the money so badly.\\" In November 1911, he and Sheldon signed a contract for the sale of the negatives for $1000. Butcher was to receive $100 down; the rest would be paid after the Nebraska legislature passed a bill appropriating funds for the purchase. Unfortunately for Butcher, a feud was raging between Sheldon and Clarence S. Paine, secretary of the Historical Society. Sheldon was an ardent Populist; Paine, a follower of conservative Democrat J. Sterling Morton. Sheldon believed that Paine had used underhanded tactics to displace his predecessor as secretary; Paine believed that Sheldon was scheming to bring the Society under control of the University of Nebraska regents. At the legislature's next biennial session, in 1913, Sheldon had an appropriations bill introduced to pay for the Butcher purchase. The bill passed the House unanimously, but ran into stiff opposition in the Senate, probably at Paine's instigation. In the end, Butcher was forced to accept a compromise payment of only $600. Butcher's Texas land deals came to nothing. In 1915, he moved to Broken Bow, back in Custer County. In December of that year, Lillie Butcher, who had suffered ill health for many years, died. For a short time in early 1916, Butcher worked for Sheldon, annotating his collection of negatives and adding narratives that had not been included in Pioneer History. In 1917, he married Mrs. Laura M. (Brachear) Nation. Butcher briefly worked as a travelling salesman for a grain and flour mill. However, he abandoned this for less practical schemes. He invented what he described as an \\"electromagnetic oil detector\\", applying the principles of dowsing to the discovery of oil. In 1921, he planned a photographic expedition to Central America to produce material for a series of travelogue lectures, and tried to interest Sheldon in it; Sheldon was skeptical, and the expedition was never launched. In about 1924, he began marketing a patent medicine, consisting chiefly of alcohol, dubbed \\"Butcher's Wonder of the Age\\". Butcher, ca. 1919 In 1926, the Butchers moved to Greeley, Colorado; Butcher died there on March 18, 1927. Works Butcher's work received little notice outside of Nebraska during his lifetime. Although there was a market for photos depicting the romance of the Wild West, the public preferred mountains and canyons to open prairie. Later in his life, popular taste inclined toward the modern and the sophisticated; images of rustics gathered around sod houses were out of fashion. His photographs had little to recommend them from an artistic standpoint. Biographer John Carter describes him as unconcerned with aesthetics, and with no more than adequate technical abilities. \\"Unquestionably he was not a prairie Stieglitz.\\" Recognition of Butcher's work came only later, when the history of the settlement of the Plains began to be written. His photographs became staples of textbooks and popular works dealing with the homestead era. According to Carter, \\"They are the images that we conjure up when we think of plains settlement.\\" Butcher has been compared to painter George Catlin, who painted Native Americans in the 1830s, and to Nebraska writer and photographer Wright Morris, who depicted rural Nebraska in the 1930s and 1940s. Like them, Butcher recognized that an era in Plains history was passing, and tried to document it visually before it was gone. Even during his short career, the face of Nebraska changed; the sod houses of his earlier photographs are increasingly supplanted by frame buildings in his later ones. Butcher did not confine himself to recording events that took place when he was present. He was not above re-enacting historical events for a photo: for example, the 1878 lynching of two Custer County homesteaders at the behest of rancher Print Olive, or the cutting of another rancher's fences by homesteaders. The latter photograph has been uncritically accepted by many historians as documentation of the actual event, although a closer examination reveals that the wire- cutters are made out of wood. Butcher also did not hesitate to retouch photos. He photographed a hill in Cherry County that had been important to early settlers because of its cedar trees; since the trees had been cut long before he got there with his camera, he scratched trees on the bare hill on his negative. To illustrate Ephraim Swain Finch's account of how he had battled an 1876 infestation of grasshoppers, he posed Finch in his cornfield, then incised scores of dots and specks into the negative to depict the flying insects. When he sought to illustrate a large flock of ducks, but realized that the birds were flying too fast for his camera to record, he photographed the scene without the waterfowl and then scratched dozens of ducks into the negative. Butcher retouched for his own purposes as well. On one occasion, he damaged a spot on a negative, producing a hole in a photograph of a sod house. Rather than undertaking a round trip of to re-shoot the scene, he concealed the damage by inking a crudely drawn turkey on the negative. Upon seeing the finished product, the homesteader expressed wonderment, declaring that he owned no white turkeys; but he was persuaded to put aside his doubts, since the camera was incapable of lying. Queen Anne house on the property. Butcher's determination to record a vanishing era led him to photograph every detail of life in the homestead era. According to the editor of a 1965 edition of Pioneer History, \\"There was nothing too inconsequential for him to direct his camera upon.\\" The Butcher collection at the Nebraska State Historical Society consists of nearly 3,500 negatives; nearly 1,500 were taken in Custer County, and more than 1,000 show sod houses. The number and scope of Butcher's photographs has made them a valuable resource to the historian of the period. Nebraska folklorist Roger Welsch conducted a detailed analysis of Butcher's sod-house photos, including furnishings, farm equipment, animals, etc., for his 1968 Sod Walls, which initiated present-day investigations of sod-house construction and living. Studies based on the photographs continue: in the 21st century, digital image processing enabled researchers to see details inside doors and windows, which appeared as nothing more than dark oblongs in the original prints. Although Butcher never achieved financial success or artistic recognition, and died believing himself a failure, his work has endured.

History The old name of Gulshan-e-Kabir is Pharawa but the still older name is Ralta Khonbu. Ralta Khonbu was known for its beautiful and lush green fields and meadows. The village was struck by a powerful flood coming from the mountains due to the breakage of a huge lake. This resulted in the total devastation of Ralta Khonbu; the once plain village with beautiful orchards and lush green fields was now covered by mud and mighty rocks. The surrounding villagers noticed that there was no trees or greenery left in Ralta Khonbu so they started calling her Phara (meaning bald in balti language). Phara with excessive usage became Pharawa; a name the villagers never liked. Pharawa and Ralta Khonbu were equally used for some time but Pharawa dominated and was later registered in all the government records by the Dogra Rule so the name became a permanent identity for Ralta Khonbu. Later in 1992 a group of youth from Pharawa residing in Karachi founded an organization by the name \\"Anjuman-e-Falah-o-Behbud\\" and their top priority was to give a new name to the village. Different names including the ancient name of Ralta Khonbu were taken up as a choice but finally they agreed upon the name Gulshan-e-Ameer-e-Kabir, shortly known as Gulshan-e-Kabir, named after the great Islamic saint and missionary from Iran, Ameer Kabir Syyed Ali Hamadni whose intense preachings converted the villagers form Buddhism to Islam. The new name was warmly welcomed and accepted by the villagers and now this beautiful village in the middle of high rising mountains of Karakorum is known as Gulshan-e-Kabir(the garden of Ameer Kabir Syed Ali Hamadani A.R). According to history of Baltistan, Raja Ghori Tham had ruled here before 850 A.D. Ghori Tham was one of the powerful rulers of his time in Baltistan and Laddakh. His might can be imagined by the traces of his fort found on the top of a mountain situated in Gulshan-e-Kabir. No food and water was available at the near vicinity of the fort and had to be carried it, down from the village through a special and secrete tunnel made in the mountain. Ghori Tham used this fort for defense purposes in the events of foreign invasions. This fort was almost inevitable for most of the invaders as Ghori Tham stood at the top of the mountain and attacked his opponents with rocks rolling down the mountains.

It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets that may be transiting their stars. On April 18, 2013 it was announced that the star has five planets, two of which, Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f are within the star's habitable zone. The outermost, Kepler-62f, is likely a rocky planet. Nomenclature and history Kepler Space Telescope search volume, in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy. Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-62 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J18525105+4520595. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 9002278, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-701. Planetary candidates were detected around the star by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth, although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used. Following the acceptance of the discovery paper, the Kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of \\"Kepler-62\\". The discoverers referred to the star as Kepler-62, which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft. Hence, this is the name used by the public to refer to the star and its planets. Candidate planets that are associated with stars studied by the Kepler Mission are assigned the designations \\".01\\", \\".02\\", \\".03\\", \\".04\\", \\".05\\" etc. after the star's name, in the order of discovery. If planet candidates are detected simultaneously, then the ordering follows the order of orbital periods from shortest to longest. Following these rules, the first three candidate planets were detected simultaneously, with orbital periods of 18.16406, 5.714932, and 122.3874 days, respectively, in the 2011 data release, with another two candidate planets, with orbital periods of 267.29 and 12.4417 days, respectively, being detected in a 2012 data release by the Kepler spacecraft. The designations b, c, d, e, and f derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet. In the case of Kepler-62, all of the known planets in the system were announced at one time, so b is applied to the closest planet to the star and f to the farthest. The name Kepler-62 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 62nd star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets. Stellar characteristics Kepler-62 is a K-type main sequence star that is approximately 69% the mass of and 64% the radius of the Sun. It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is somewhat poor in metals, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of about ‚Äì0.37, or about 42% of the amount of iron and other heavier metals found in the Sun. The star's luminosity is typical for a star like Kepler-62, with a luminosity of around 21% of that of the solar luminosity. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.75. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Planetary system All known planets transit the star; this means that all five planets' orbits appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. The radii of the planets fall between 0.54 and 1.95 Earth radii. Of particular interest are the planets e and f, as they are the best candidates for solid planets falling into the habitable zone of their star. Their radii, 1.61 and 1.41 Earth radii respectively, put them in a radius range where they may be solid terrestrial planets. Their positions within the Kepler-62 system mean that they fall within Kepler-62's habitable zone: the distance range where, for a given chemical composition (significant amounts of carbon dioxide for Kepler-62f, and a protective cloud cover for Kepler-62e), these two planets could have liquid water on their surfaces, perhaps completely covering them. The masses of the planets could not be directly determined using either the radial velocity or the transit timing method; this failure leads to weak upper limits for the planets' masses. For e and f, that upper limit amounts to 36 and 35 Earth masses, respectively; the real masses are expected to be significantly lower. Based on composition models, the real masses of the planets are probably likely to be 2.1, 0.1, 5.5, 4.8, and 2.8 , respectively, taking into the uncertainty in composition and upper mass limits.NASA Kepler Discovers New Potentially Habitable Exoplanets Abel Mendez.

Kepler-62e is located about from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.Kepler-62e: Super-Earth and Possible Water World The exoplanet was found using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Kepler-62e may be a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet; it lies in the inner part of its host star's habitable zone.3 Potentially Habitable 'Super-Earths' Explained (Infographic) Kepler-62e orbits its host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger (in diameter) than Earth.Super- Earths: Two Earth-like planets that could host life discovered. Indian Express. 20 April 2013 Characteristics  Mass, radius and temperature  Kepler-62e is a super-Earth with a radius 1.61 times that of Earth. This is just above the limit where planets with more than 1.6 may be more gaseous than they are rocky, so Kepler-62e may likely be a mini-Neptune. It has an equilibrium temperature of . It has an estimated mass of 4.5 , however the true parameter could not be determined, upper limits place it at 36 , which is unlikely to actually be true. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-62, orbited by a total of five planets. The star has a mass of 0.69 and a radius of 0.64 . It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is somewhat metal-poor, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of ‚àí0.37, or 42% of the solar amount. Its luminosity () is 21% that of the Sun. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.65. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Kepler-62e orbits its host star with an orbital period of 122.3 days at a distance of about 0.42 AU (compared to the distance of Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). A 2016 study came to a conclusion that the orbits of Kepler-62f and Kepler-62e are likely in a 2:1 orbital resonance. This means that for every two orbits of planet \\"e\\", \\"f\\" completes one around its star. It receives 20% more sunlight than Earth does from the Sun. Habitability Given the planet's age (7 ¬± 4 billion years), stellar flux (1.2 ¬± 0.2 times Earth's) and radius (1.61 ¬± 0.05 times Earth's), a rocky (silicate-iron) composition with the addition of a possibly substantial amount of water is considered plausible. A modeling study suggests it is likely that a great majority of planets in Kepler-62e's size range are completely covered by ocean. However, given that some studies show that super- Earths above 1.6 may have a volatile-rich composition (similar to a mini- Neptune), and Kepler-62e's radius is estimated to be 1.61 , it may be a gaseous planet with no definite surface, and thus may not be habitable to known terrestrial life forms.Leslie A. Rogers \\"Most 1.6 Earth-Radius Planets are not Rocky\\" Another factor that is critical is the stellar flux. Given that the stellar flux of Kepler-62e is 20% more than what Earth receives from the Sun, it is possible that the surface temperature of Kepler-62e may be over , enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse effect. Such flux may reduce the habitability factors. Discovery and cultural impact Confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones (artist's impressions).(Kepler-62e, 62f, 186f, 296e, 296f, 438b, 440b, 442b) In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-62; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-62e occurred roughly every 122 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 122-day transits. The discovery, along with the planetary system of the star Kepler-69 were announced on April 18, 2013. On 9 May 2013, a congressional hearing by two U.S. House of Representatives subcommittees discussed \\"Exoplanet Discoveries: Have We Found Other Earths?,\\" prompted by the discovery of exoplanet Kepler-62f, along with Kepler-62e and Kepler-69c. A related special issue of the journal Science, published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets. Kepler-62f and the other Kepler-62 exoplanets are being specially targeted as part of the SETI search programs. At nearly distant, Kepler-62e is too remote and its star too far for current telescopes or the next generation of planned telescopes to determine its mass or whether it has an atmosphere. The Kepler spacecraft focused on a single small region of the sky but next-generation planet-hunting space telescopes, such as TESS and CHEOPS, will examine nearby stars throughout the sky. Nearby stars with planets can then be studied by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and future large ground-based telescopes to analyze atmospheres, determine masses and infer compositions. Additionally the Square Kilometer Array would significantly improve radio observations over the Arecibo Observatory and Green Bank Telescope.

It is orbiting within the habitable zone of the star Kepler-62, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is located about 990 light- years (300 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra. Kepler-62f orbits its star at a distance of from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 267.3 days, has a mass at least 2.8 times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.41 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is a relatively quiet star, and has less mass than the Sun ‚Äì thus it can live up to a span of about 30 billion years or so. Due to its mass, Kepler-62f is likely a terrestrial or ocean- covered planet. However, key components of the exoplanet still need to be assessed to determine habitability; such as its atmosphere if one exists, since it lies within the outer part of its host star's habitable zone. The discovery of the exoplanet (along with Kepler-62e) was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler spacecraft data release. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. According to scientists, it is a potential candidate to search for extraterrestrial life, and was chosen as one of the targets to study by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program. Characteristics Mass, radius and temperature Kepler-62f is a super-Earth, an exoplanet with a radius and mass bigger than Earth, but smaller than that of the ice giants Neptune and Uranus. It has an equilibrium temperature of , close to that of Mars. It has a radius of 1.4 , placing it below the radius of ‚â•1.6 where it would otherwise be a mini-Neptune with a volatile composition, with no solid surface. Due to its radius, it is likely a rocky planet. However, the mass isn't constrained yet, estimates place an upper limit of <35 , the real mass is expected to be significantly lower than this. The true value is likely around 2.8 , assuming a rocky composition. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-62, orbited by a total of five known planets. The star has a mass of 0.69 and a radius of 0.64 . It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K.

The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.65. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Kepler-62f orbits its host star every 267.29 days at a semi-major axis distance of about 0.718 astronomical units (107,400,000 km, 66,700,000 mi), which is roughly the same as Venus's semi-major axis from the Sun. Compared to Earth, this is about seven-tenths of the distance from it to the Sun. Kepler-62f is estimated to receive about 41% of the amount of sunlight that Earth does from the Sun, which is comparable to Mars, which receives 43%. Habitability Artist's conception of a rocky Earth-size planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its parent star. Given the planet's age (7 ¬± 4 billion years), irradiance (0.41 ¬± 0.05 times Earth's) and radius (1.41 ¬± 0.07 times Earth's), a rocky (silicate-iron) composition with the addition of a possibly substantial amount of water is considered plausible. A modeling study indicates it is likely that a great majority of planets in its size range are completely covered by ocean. If its density is the same as Earth's, its mass would be 1.413 or 2.80 times Earth's. The planet has the potential for hosting a moon according to a study of tidal effects on potentially habitable planets. The planet may be the only habitable-zone candidate which would avoid desiccation by irradiation from the host star at its current location. Although Kepler-62f may be an ocean-covered planet possessing rock and water at the surface, it is the farthest out from its star, so without a supplementary amount of carbon dioxide (), it may be a planet covered entirely in ice. In order for Kepler-62f to sustain an Earth- like climate (with an average temperature of around , at least of carbon dioxide would have to be present in the planet's atmosphere. Because it is the outermost planet of its star system, the effects of tidal evolution from the inner planets and the host star on Kepler-62f are not likely to have had significant outcomes over its lifetime. The axial tilt is likely to have been unchanged, and thus, the planet may have an axial tilt (anywhere from 14¬∞‚Äì30¬∞) and rotational period somewhat similar to Earth. This can further make the planet more sustainable for habitability, as it would be able to transfer heat to the night side, instead of it being a planet with its surface being half water and half ice. K-type stars like Kepler-62 can live for approximately 20‚Äì40 billion years, 2 to 4 times longer than the estimated lifetime of our Sun. The low stellar activity of orange dwarfs like Kepler-62, creates a relatively benign radiation environment for planets orbiting in their habitable zones, increasing their potential habitability. One review assay in 2015 concluded that Kepler-62f, along with the exoplanets Kepler-186f and Kepler-442b, were likely the best candidates for being potentially habitable planets.NASA Astrobiology Strategy 2015 .(PDF), page 92, NASA On 13 May 2016, researchers at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) announced that they had found various scenarios that allow the exoplanet to be habitable. They tested several simulations based on Kepler-62f having an atmosphere that ranges in thickness from the same as Earth's all the way up to 12 times thicker than our planet's, various concentrations of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, ranging from the same amount as is in the Earth's atmosphere up to 2,500 times that level and several different possible configurations for its orbital path.http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2015.1353 The Effect of Orbital Configuration on the Possible Climates and Habitability of Kepler-62f In June 2018, studies suggest that Kepler-62f may have seasons and a climate similar to those on Earth. There is another possibility. Kepler-62f and Kepler-62e are very close to each other. It has been estimated the trip from one to another planet would take only 52 days, so panspermia is possible. Discovery, follow-up studies & SETI target Confirmed small exoplanets in habitable zones (artist's impressions).(Kepler-62e, 62f, 186f, 296e, 296f, 438b, 440b, 442b) NASA's Kepler spacecraft observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-62, between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. The software pipeline that searched for periodic dip in the stellar brightness, the sign of a planetary transit of the star, initially found three planets around Kepler-62, including Kepler-62e. Due to a bug in the software pipeline, the planet 62f was missed. Eric Agol, a Professor of Astronomy at the University of Washington, discovered three additional transits that had been missed by the pipeline, which occurred every 267 days, and with a more detailed analysis the Kepler team concluded that a fourth planetary body, 62f, was responsible for the periodic 267-day transits. The discovery, along with the planetary system of the star Kepler-69 were announced on April 18, 2013. On 9 May 2013, a congressional hearing by two U.S. House of Representatives subcommittees discussed \\"Exoplanet Discoveries: Have We Found Other Earths?,\\" prompted by the discovery of exoplanet Kepler-62f, along with Kepler-62e and Kepler-69c.

Kepler-62f and the other Kepler-62 exoplanets are being specially targeted as part of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) search programs. They will scan the areas for any signals that may represent technological life in the system. Given the interstellar distance of 990 light-years (300 pc), the signals would have left the planet that many years ago. As of 2016, no such signals have been found. At nearly distant, Kepler-62f is too remote and its star too far for current telescopes or the next generation of planned telescopes to determine its mass or whether it has an atmosphere. The Kepler spacecraft focused on a single small region of the sky but next-generation planet-hunting space telescopes, such as TESS and CHEOPS, will examine nearby stars throughout the sky.

After World War I, he authored the landscape design for seven American battlefield cemeteries in France and Belgium: Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial, Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial, Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial, Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial, Somme American Cemetery and Memorial, St. Mihiel American Cemetery and Memorial, and Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial. During his time on the Commission of Fine Arts, Greenleaf consulted on landscape design in a number of national parks. In 1924, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician. After his retirement from public service in 1927, Greenleaf rarely worked. However, he did consult with the firm of McKim, Mead and White on the landscape design around Arlington Memorial Bridge in 1931 and 1932. In retirement, Greenleaf devoted himself to landscape painting, working primarily in Italy and on the Isle of Skye. His work was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York City. Death Greenleaf moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, around 1918. He contracted pneumonia in 1932, and although he recovered he remained in poor health. A few months before his death, he moved in with his son (also a resident of New Canaan). Greenleaf suffered from appendicitis, and had his appendix removed on April 3, 1933. He never recovered from the shock of the surgery, and died in Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, on April 15. Funeral services were held at the Congregational Church in New Canaan, and he was buried at the New Cemetery in Somerville, New Jersey.\\"Jersey Burial for James L. Greenleaf.\\" Syracuse Herald.

She was the daughter of George A.H. and Helen (Hard) Potts, whose wealthy mining family founded Pottsville, Pennsylvania.Bergen, p. 443-444. They had a son, Donald Leal Greenleaf, born June 5, 1890. Bertha Potts Greenleaf died in 1911. Greenleaf was a Republican, but not active in party politics. He was a member of the Columbia University Club, the Cosmos Club, and the Century Club. He was an associate of the National Academy of Design, and served several times on juries for the American Academy in Rome. He was a long-time fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects, and served as its national president from 1922 to 1927. References Bibliography *Bergen, Tunis G., ed.

Many chemotherapy drugs for cancer lack tumour specificity and the doses required to reach therapeutic levels in the tumour are often toxic to other tissues. DEPT strategies are an experimental method of reducing the systemic toxicity of a drug, by achieving high levels of the active drug only at the desired site. This article describes the variations of DEPT technology. Antibody- directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) ADEPT is a strategy to overcome the problems of lack of tumor selectivity. An antibody designed/developed against a tumor antigen is linked to an enzyme and injected to the blood, resulting in selective binding of the enzyme in the tumor. When the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, a prodrug is administrated into the blood circulation, which is converted to an active cytotoxic drug by the enzyme, only within the tumor. Selectivity is achieved by the tumor specificity of the antibody and by delaying prodrug administration until there is a large differential between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels. ADEPT has shown antitumor activity in animal tumor models of human choriocarcinoma and colonic and breast carcinoma. ADEPT history The first pilot-scale clinical trial of ADEPT was carried out at Charing Cross Hospital, London, using an anti-CEA F(ab‚Ä≤)2 antibody conjugated to the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2). The antibody used in the first ADEPT clinical trial was of murine origin and the enzyme was bacterial. Host antibodies to both components of the AEC were present in the blood of all non-immunosuppressed patients by day 10 after AEC infusion. Several patients received ciclosporin since it had been shown in rabbits that this could delay the appearance of host antibodies to soluble proteins. A subsequent, small- scale trial at the Royal Free Hospital, London, used the same agents as in the Charing Cross Hospital trial but the protocol was modified to provide additional pharmacokinetic data and most patients received only a single course of treatment.KD Bagshawe and M Napier, Early clinical studies with ADEPT. In: RG Melton and RJ Knox Editors, Enzyme-Prodrug Strategies for Cancer Therapy Kluwer Academic, London (1999), 199‚Äì207. Gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) GDEPT is a suicide gene therapy in which the enzyme required for prodrug conversion is produced within the target cell, using a gene delivered to it by gene therapy. When an adequate differential exists between the targeted cell and endogenous tissue, non-toxic prodrug is administered and is subsequently converted into its toxic form within the target cell. Systems that use viral vectors to deliver the gene are known as VDEPT. Virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (VDEPT) VDEPT is the term given to the use of a virus to deliver the gene for GDEPT. VDEPT can potentially be used to enhance the therapeutic potential of oncolytic viruses.  Lectin-directed Enzyme-Activated Prodrug Therapy (LEAPT)  LEAPT is a variant of DEPT in which the manipulation of carbohydrates on the surface of the enzyme is used to target the enzyme activity to the cell in question. This allows exploitation of the sometimes highly specific sugar-lectin interactions found in organisms, including humans. Proof-of-principle examples have shown delivery to target organs of enzymes that specifically release cytotoxics to treat tumours. Polymer-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (PDEPT) PDEPT uses polymer-drug conjugates, drugs contained within a polymer 'shell' such as pHPMA and designed to be released only by a specific enzyme. Clostridia- directed enzyme prodrug therapy (CDEPT) CDEPT is the use of Clostridia to convert prodrugs into active drug agents. CDEPT exploits the hypoxic environment of solid tumors to target drugs to tumors using anaerobic bacteria resident in the tumour to convert the pro-drug to the active form. Intravenously injected clostridial spores exhibit a specificity for tumours, colonising the hypoxic areas of the tumours.  The CDEPT strategy  Perhaps the most challenging issue in cancer treatment is how to reduce the side effects of the injected anti-cancer agents, which are of a high cytotoxicity potential. A widely used solution is to use enzymes which are able to convert a relatively non-toxic prodrug precursor into the active drug form(s). Clostridial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (CDEPT) is one of the possible approaches. Solid tumors, in contrast to normal tissues, grow rapidly. As a result, the cancerous tissues may suffer from inadequate blood and oxygen supply. Therefore, clostridia can grow in tumor and destroy it specifically. (Originally, Parker and co-workers showed that the injection of Clostridium histolyticum spores to the transplanted sarcomas of mice results in significant tumour lysis. Soon after, it was shown that a direct injection is not necessary, and that tumour colonization was readily obtained after intravenous administration of spores). In CDEPT, a prodrug-converting enzyme expressed by a clostridial expression plasmid converts a prodrug into an active drug form within the tumor. While the prodrug is the inactive form and can be administrated to the blood, the products of the prodrug cleavage are highly cytotoxic and show their effect only in the vicinity of tumor cells. Difficulties in the engineering of clostridial strains have restricted the application of other enzyme prodrug systems. So far, two enzymes have been applied in CDEPT: cytosine deaminase and nitroreductase.

But then the Kolsky's modified model comes to our rescue, producing an accurate representation of the velocity dispersion within the seismic frequency band. The basic Kolsky model is presented in Kolsky's book \\"Stress waves in solids\\" that are available as a Google book.\\"Stress waves in Solids\\".(1963 edition) Kolsky's modified model is presented in Wang's book Seismic inverse Q filtering. This book is also available as a Google book:Seismic inverse Q filtering (2008),  Basic  The theoretical background for mathematical Q models can be found in the Wikipedia article: Mathematical Q models. Here we found a function K(w) we can call a propagation constant in line with Futterman.Futterman (1962) p.5280 :K(iw) =k(w)+ i a(w) \\\\quad (1.3) k(w) can be linked to the phase velocity of the seismic wave with the formula: : c(w)=\\\\frac {w}{k(w)} \\\\quad (1.4) To obtain a solution that can be applied to seismic k(w) must be connected to a function that represent the way the seismic wave propagates in the seismic media. This functions can be regarded as a Q-model. In his outline Wang calls the Kolsky-Futterman model the Kolsky model. The model assumes the attenuation Œ±(w) to be strictly linear with frequency over the range of measurement:Wang 2008, p. 18, sec. 2.1: Kolsky's attenuation-dispersion model :\\\\alpha=\\\\frac {w}{(2 c_r Q_r)} \\\\quad (1.5) And defines the phase velocity as: :\\\\frac {1}{c(w)} =\\\\frac {1}{c_r} (1-\\\\frac {1}{\\\\pi Q_r} ln \\\\frac{w}{w_r}) \\\\quad (1.6) Where cr and Qr are the phase velocity and the Q value at a reference frequency wr.

A requirement in the theory for materials satisfying the linear attenuation assumption is that the reference frequency wr is a finite (arbitrarily small but nonzero) cut-off on the absorption. According to Kolsky, we are free to choose wr following the phenomenological criterion that it be small compared with the lowest measured frequency w in the frequency band.Wang 2008, p.19 Those who want a deeper insight into this concept can go to Futterman (1962)Futterman W.I. 1962.

The story takes place during the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916. It was O‚ÄôFlaherty‚Äôs final novel.  Plot  The novel follows a diverse group of characters who are caught up in the events of the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. The group are dispatched to defend the main road from Dublin to D√∫n Laoghaire (Dublin‚Äôs main port) from the expected arrival of British reinforcements. The novel explores each man‚Äôs motivations, fears and hopes through the battles and violence which ensue. The principal characters are: The uneducated, slow-witted Bartly Madden; Kinsella, the disciplined commander of a small band of insurgents; Stapleton, an anarchist and would-be poet; and Tommy Colgan, a youth consumed by fear and self-doubt.Five Irish Writers: The Errand of Keeping Alive by John Hildebidle Harvard University Press (November 11, 1989)  Critical reception  Insurrection received generally positive reviews, although it was compared unfavourably to some of O'Flaherty's other work, such as The Informer and Famine. Kirkus Reviews described it as \\"A vigorous, penetrating study of organized rebellion beside which the Hemingway revolutionists are very cold potatoes.\\" Writing in The Saturday Review, a U.S. literary magazine, Thomas Sugrue said, \\"Like the rebellion itself, the book is brief, sharp, blazing with action and lit by a radiance of idealism which softens the ugly reality with which it deals, while at the same time illuminating the ugliest of its details. It may well be the best thing O‚ÄôFlaherty has done.\\" The Irish monthly literary publication The Bell (1940‚Äì54) was more reserved: its (anonymous) reviewer said, \\"It might be said that only readers who know nothing of about Easter Week could get the best value out of Insurrection. But will even such readers take as a matter of course those brief passages in which Mr. O‚ÄôFlaherty attempts to find philosophical meaning for the desperate act of violence by lifting particular events from the plane on which they have vividness at least to a plane where they are coloured clouds of abstraction?\\" John Hildebidle, in Five Irish Writers, was equally lukewarm. \\"In trying to make fiction out of what amounts to a theory of revolutionary history,\\" Hildebidle wrote, \\"he [O'Flaherty] produces characters with none of the persuasive energy and substance of his earlier novels\\". The literary review website Goodreads gave Insurrection a 3.67 out of 5 rating.

It is based on the play of the same name by American playwright David Ives, which itself was inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's novel Venus in Furs. It stars Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric, the only actors in the film. The film premiered in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival on 25 May.2013 Cannes Film Festival: Screenings of 25 May 2013 In January 2014 the film received five nominations at the 39th C√©sar Awards, winning for Best Director. Plot Thomas Novacheck is the writer-director of a new play, an adaptation of the 1870 novel Venus in Furs by Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Early in the movie we learn that the book begins with a quote from the Book of Judith: \\"And the Lord hath smitten him and delivered him into a woman's hands.\\" The film begins with Thomas alone in a Parisian theatre after a day of auditioning actresses for the lead character, Wanda von Dunayev. Thomas laments on the phone the poor performances to come through. As Thomas prepares to leave the theatre, an actress named Vanda Jordan arrives disheveled. She claims to have had an audition slot earlier in the day, but her name does not appear on the audition list. In a whirlwind of energy and unrestrained aggression, Vanda persuades the Thomas to let her read for the part. At first appearing untalented, when she begins to read it becomes clear that she is excellent actress and perfect for the part. Although initially presenting as uneducated, throughout the movie Vanda displays knowledge and talent that almost seems superhuman. For example, she surprises Thomas by producing the full script, not just the portion given out to actors to use in the audition, and having memorized it. The audition is in a theater and she shows not only a command of staging, but also lighting - adjusting the theater's lightboard, which presumably she has never seen before, without hesitation. And she also has brought a full set of costumes, including some for Thomas to wear which fit him perfectly. At one point she \\"guesses\\" an amazingly accurate picture of Thomas' fianc√©'s life and background. The subject of the play is sexual domination and submission. As the audition continues Vanda attacks it as sexist, soft-core S&M; pornography. Thomas at first defends it as a faithful adaptation of a literary classic about passion and desire. Vanda accuses Thomas of having his own masochistic fantasies, which he denies. However, as the film develops, he increasingly identifies with the masochistic male lead in the play. By the end of the film he has become Vanda's slave. In the final scene Thomas is bound and tied to a pole. Vanda appears, proclaims \\"Bacchae of the Cadmea. Dance for Dionysus!\\", dances before Thomas, and leaves. The movie ends with the quote from the Book of Judith: \\"And the Lord hath smitten him and delivered him into a woman's hands.\\" Cast * Emmanuelle Seigner as Vanda Jourdain * Mathieu Amalric as Thomas Novacheck Production The intention to adapt Ives' play was announced in September 2012. Louis Garrel was to play Novacheck. Filming was scheduled to begin in November 2012, but in the event, production was delayed until January 2013 and Garrel was replaced by Amalric. Release Sundance Selects/IFC Films acquired the U.S. rights to the film following its premiere at Cannes.\\"Roman Polanski's Venus in Fur Gets U.S. Distribution\\", Variety, Accessed online, 30 March 2014 Critical reception A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \\"Working from a French translation of the play (which was widely acclaimed when it ran on and off Broadway a few years ago), Mr. Polanski has marked the text with his own fingerprints.

Chiatura represents the largest manganese reserve in Georgia and one of the largest in the world, having estimated reserves of 239 million tonnes of manganese ore grading around 26% manganese metal. The deposit was discovered in 1879 by the Georgian poet Akaki Tsereteli who explored the area in search of manganese and iron ores. After other intense explorations it was discovered that there are several layers of manganese oxide, peroxide and carbonate with thickness varying between and . The deposit was finally proven to be commercial and the JSC Chiaturmanganese company (JSC Chiaturmanganumi) was set up to manage and exploit the huge deposit. The gross-balance of workable manganese ores of all commercial categories is estimated as 239 million tonnes, which include manganese oxide ores - 41.6%, carbonate ores - 39%, and peroxide ores - 19%. Prior to World War I, the German Krupp family was one of the leading investors in the mining operations at Chiaturi. In 1913 the mine produced 1 million tonnes of manganese ore, half the world's output. By the early 1920s output was only one-third of that 1913 peak, owing both to Bolshevic property confiscations and the withdrawal of foreign investment. In 1924, the American financier W. Averell Harriman became interested in an investment deal that would revive production. In an ill-fated deal with a Soviet government eager to ink a deal with a politically connected American investor so as to assist in its efforts to achieve diplomatic recognition from the United States government, Harriman capitalized the Georgian Manganese Company with $4 million of his own money, agreeing to pay significant fixed royalties per tonne to both the Soviet government and the previous Georgian mine owners. It would serve as the foreign centerpiece of Lenin's New Economic Policy. In its first year of operations, 1925, Harriman's company increased the mine's production from 436,000 tonnes to 772,000 tonnes. Thereafter, however, the Harriman venture quickly soured as global manganese prices fell and planned infrastructure improvements at the mine and on the railroad to Poti increased dramatically. By 1928, Harriman saw that continued operations at Chiaturi were not economically feasible and he negotiated a buyout agreement with the Soviet government.Abramson, Rudy. Spanning the Century: The Life of W. Averell Harriman, 1891-1986. Chapter VI - Mines. William Morrow and Company, Inc. 1992. The mine is currently owned by Georgian Manganese Holding, a subsidiary of the British company Stemcor, and is part of a holding which also includes the Zestaponi ferroalloy plant and the Vartzikha hydropower station. The Chiatura mine complex which includes four underground mines and three open pit quarries has an annual production capacity of 1.18 million tonnes of manganese ore and 400,000 tonnes of manganese concentrates. The mine complex transports its manganese ore by rail to the ferroalloy plant located in Zestaponi. In 2017, a documentary about Chiatura and its mines was released, City of the Sun, directed by Rati Oneli.

He was one of the co-founders of the Ovamboland People's Congress in Cape Town, South Africa in 1957 and became one of the first participants of the Namibian liberation struggle. Kaxumba Kandola took part in the battle of Omugulugwombashe which was the first battle of the Namibian War of Independence on 26 August 1966. He evaded arrest but was eventually caught and sent to Pretoria Central Prison where he was charged under the Terrorism Act of 1976. He was tried with other Namibians in the Pretoria Terrorism Trial from September 1967 to February 1968. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on Robben Island but was eventually released in 1985. Kaxumba Kandola was born at Omatangela village in northern Namibia, one year after the British-South African forces conquered Oukwanyama kingdom. His father, Lyaalala ya Tuhadeleni, was one of the senior headman of Oukwanyama King Mandume Ya Ndemufayo. Political career Kaxumba Kandola became involved in political activities in 1943 as a member of the Mandume Movement. He was involved in workers strike at the Krantzberg Mine, near Omaruru. Kaxumba was working closely to the Anglican Priest, The Reverend Theophilus Hamutumbangela, writing petitions and sending them to the colonial administration and to the United Nations, complaining about the ill-treatments the migrant workers were receiving. In the mid 1950s Kaxumba left Namibia to South Africa and was one of the first Namibians to work in Cape Town through the contract labour system. He became a member of the Barber Shop crew which was instrumental in forming the Ovamboland People's Congress (OPC) in 1957. In 1958 the leader of OPC, Andimba Toivo ya Toivo, send a petition to the United Nations through Mburumba Kerina and Michael Scott, who were based in the United States, complaining about the human rights abuses of the contract labour system and the unlawful occupation of South West Africa by the apartheid government of South Africa. This led to a mass deportation of Namibian contract workers in Cape Town. Kaxumba was one of those who would later be deported from Cape Town. In 1959, the OPC was formally constituted into the Ovamboland People's Organization (OPO), Kaxumba became one of its leaders in Ovamboland where he held meetings with local people known as Oyoongi ya Kaxumba - \\"Kaxumba's rallies\\", he used these meetings to mobilize and educate them about colonial resistance. Following the transformation of OPO into the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in 1960 many of its leadership went into exile to lobby support from the international community and to pursue the arms liberation struggle. Kaxumba remained in the country as one of the main leaders, his house was raided a couple of times and was used to hold important SWAPO meetings by the internal leaders. He eventually went into exile in 1965 to take part in the preparation of the arms liberation struggle with the newly created People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). In 1966 when one of the first of PLAN guerrilla units arrived in Ovamboland they stayed at Kaxumba's home for several months before moving off to set up a camp at Omgulugombashe. After the attack on Omugulugwombashe, the South African regime arrested SWAPO leaders including Andimba Toivo ya Toivo and other members of the Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia, they searched for Kaxumba for months before they were able to capture him.Ellen Ndeshi Namhila (2005) Kaxumba Kandola; Man and the myth: The biography of a barefoot soldier ,Windhoek: Basler Afrika Bibliographien He was eventually arrested and taken to Pretoria. He then became Accused No. 1 in the trial, The State v. Tuhadeleni and 36 Others, under South Africa's Terrorism Act of 21 June 1967. Ephraim Kapolo died during the trial in Pretoria while Kaxumba and twenty nine other Namibians were sentenced to Robben Island. He was one of those who received a life sentence. When Kaxumba spoke at his trial just before being sentenced to a life term on Robin Island he remained defiant and unbroken. Addressing the court he said: \\"David slew Goliath because he had right on his side, and we Namibians have faith that we, too, have right on our side.\\" Tuhadeleni remained in prison until his eventual release in 1985 spending 18 years of his life in prison. Namibia gained independence on 21 March 1990. Death Kaxumba lived to see the fruits of his labour and the independence of his country that he sacrificed so much for.

Gouget noir is a red French wine grape variety that is grown in the Allier and Cher departments of central France. The grape was once widely planted with almost 17,000 hectares (42,008 acres) in the mid-19th century but the phylloxera epidemic greatly diminished it numbers and as of 2008 there was just 10 hectares (25 acres) of the grape planted in France.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 422, Allen Lane 2012 History Gouget noir may be an offspring of Gouais blanc (pictured) which is also known under the synonym Gouget blanc. The origins of the name Gouget noir is not known. Some wine experts, such as Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, speculate that it may have been named after a vineyard owner and propagator of vine cuttings since Gouget is a common family name. DNA analysis suggests that the grape may be descended from the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc that is known under the synonym Gouget blanc and has sired many French wine grapes such as Chardonnay, Gamay noir, Aubin vert, Balzac blanc and Bachet noir.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 112 Harcourt Books 2001 The grape's history in central France dates back at least to the 19th century where an 1843 document showed that it was used as both a wine and table grape in the Allier and Cher department where it was prized for the sweet flavor of its flesh. Gouget noir became a specialty of the communes of Dom√©rat, Huriel and Montlu√ßon and by the mid-19th century the grape accounted for nearly half of all vineyard plantings in Allier with almost 17,000 hectares (42,008 acres). As with nearly all French wine regions, viticulture in Allier sharply declined after the phylloxera epidemic of the late-19th century but as winemaking returned most of the vineyards in Allier replanted with different varieties such as Gamay noir. Viticulture The Allier department of central France where Gouget noir is still being grown today. Gouget noir is an early ripening variety that tends to produce small clusters of tiny berries. The vine also tends to bud early but is fairly resistant to springtime frost damage with its most significant viticultural hazard being its susceptibility to botrytis bunch rot. The grape is often confused for being clones of Gamay noir and Pinot noir and while there might be a relationship to Gamay via a shared parentage with Gouais blanc, DNA analysis has confirmed that Gouget noir is its own distinct variety. Wine regions Today, Gouget noir is still found in the Allier and Cher regions but its numbers are far fewer from its pre-phylloxera plantings or even the 739 ha (1,826 acres) that were growing after World War II. The 2008 census of wine grape varieties counted only 10 ha (25 acres) of the grape, mostly found in the commune of Huriel in the Allier department. Synonyms Over the years Gouget noir has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Gauget noir, Gouge, Gouge noir, Goujet, Lyonnais, Moret, N√©rou, Neyrac, Neyran, Neyrou and Petit Neyran.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Gouget noir Accessed: April 18th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Gouget noir"},{"id":"39150810","text":"Toxicomania colonialism, or toxic waste colonialism, refers to the practice of exporting hazardous waste from developed countries to underdeveloped ones for disposal. Background In 1992, 'toxic colonialism' was \\"a striking phrase coined by Jim Puckett of Greenpeace for the dumping of the industrial wastes of the West on territories of the Third World\\" The term refers to practices of developed nations who rid themselves of toxic or hazardous waste by shipping it to less developed areas of the world. The affected communities typically lack the resources, knowledge, political organization, or capital to resist the practice. In the US, the term may also be applied to exploitation of Native American reservations, where differing environment regulations allow the land to be more easily used for dump sites. According to The Diplomat: > In the 1980s, developed nations began tightening legislation surrounding > waste disposal and health standards. As a result, in order to avoid their > own environmental regulations and the high cost associated with them, > wealthy nations began to export their rubbish to developing nations. Rather > than managing and containing their own plastic and hazardous waste, > developed nations exported it by the container load to developing nations, > which lacked adequate facilities to store or dispose of it. In the 1980s a > new term was coined to describe this practice: ‚ÄúWaste colonialism.‚Äù Environmental racism vs toxic colonialism It is important to distinguish the difference between toxic colonialism and environmental racism. Toxic colonialism is the practice of targeting poor communities of color in developing nations for waste disposal and/or experimentation with risky technologies. Environmental racism is the inequitable distribution of environmental hazards based on race. In other words, toxic colonialism can be seen as ‚Äúmicro‚Äù as it focuses on a specific area or group of people. Environmental racism can be seen as ‚Äúmacro‚Äù, examining the issue on a larger, worldwide scale. Significance Despite some economic gains to developing nations, the adverse effects of toxic colonialism on the people and environment of these nations outweigh any positives. History shows that the overall impact of the toxic waste dumping in these nations has been devastating and has severely compromised all aspects of human health. In a case study for the 2010 Geneva Convention, Bashir Mohamed Hussein, PhD details one account of toxic and radioactive waste dumping in Somalia and its effects, ‚ÄúUNEP...reported that the people were complaining of unusual health problems including ‚Äúacute respiratory infections, heavy dry coughing, mouth bleeding abdominal hemorrhage and unusual chemical skin reaction...Likewise, both Somali and non-Somali medical doctors working in Somalia have reported an excessive incidence of cancer, unknown diseases, spontaneous miscarriages of the pregnant women and child malformation.‚Äù The overwhelming significance of toxic waste on humans is brought forth and it can be said that the idea of those in developing nations as being those that do not have the resources, knowledge or capital of that of the developed nations is just cause for developing nations to be subject to such treatment. Socioeconomic aspects Although there are many alarming health effects of toxic colonialism, these effects are often overshadowed by the economic interests of both the developing and developed nations. The number one socioeconomic aspect of toxic colonialism is money. Simply put, \\"developed countries want to save it, and developing countries want to earn it.\\" There is no regard for the health concerns developing countries subject their people to as long as there is a monetary or economical gain and the developed world takes full advantage of this in order to save money, ‚Äúthe wealth and income gaps between developing nations and developed nations have continually grown throughout the past century. As developing nations seek to boost economic growth, the enforcement of the few hazardous waste regulations in place often fall by the wayside. Many agencies in these developing countries do not have the resources to give approvals or enforce their regulations‚Äù. On the other hand, ‚Äúdeveloped countries generally have increasingly stringent environmental regulations governing the domestic disposal of hazardous wastes. When compliance costs are coupled with an increased quantity of waste and local opposition to disposal, they generally produce drastically increased disposal costs for hazardous waste.‚Äù Therefore, it‚Äôs easy for developed countries to seek those less developed and offer them the idea of economic relief at a seemingly minor, but substantial environment cost. In some instances, monetary funds are not the only thing exchanged between developed and developing nations, ‚ÄúSomali warring parties used to accept hazardous and highly toxic wastes in exchange of army and ammunition‚Äù. This example is an indication of the separation between developed and developing nation and shows the lengths that not only developing nations are willing to extend to meet their needs, it also shows the desperation of developed nations to remove themselves from handling excessive toxic waste commitments. Progress Over the past few decades there have been improvements in environmental protection that have tried to end the illegal dumping of toxic waste worldwide. The Basel Convention in 1989 was a treaty signed by 105 countries and was intended to regulate the international shipping of toxic substances. Despite the treaty, millions of tons of toxic and hazardous materials continue to move both legally and illegally from richer countries to poorer countries each year. The history of suburbanization reveals that although many forces contributed to decentralization, it has largely been an exclusionary undertaking. In 1992 the US established the US Environmental Act in an attempt to identify areas threatened by the highest levels of toxic chemicals and ensure that groups of individuals residing within those areas have opportunities and resources to participate in public discussions concerning siting and cleanup of industrial facilities. One organization that has had success in fighting toxic colonialism is the Basel Action Network (BAN). BAN is focused on confronting the global environmental injustice and economic inefficiency of toxic trade (toxic wastes, products and technologies) and its devastating impacts.

Stroke affects about 6 in 100,000 children. Pediatric stroke causes can and does happen at any age. Stroke is different in children and newborns than it is in adults. Children have hemorrhagic strokes as often as they have ischemic strokes, while adults are more likely to have ischemic strokes. Sixty percent of pediatric strokes occur in boys. Causes of stroke are also different in children than they are in adults. Types of Strokes Ischemic In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen: # Thrombosis (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally) # Embolism (obstruction due to an embolus from elsewhere in the body, see below), # Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in shock) # Venous thrombosis. Stroke without an obvious explanation is termed \\"cryptogenic\\" (of unknown origin); this constitutes 30-40% of all ischemic strokes.(Donnan ref missing) Hemorrhagic Intracranial hemorrhage is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the skull vault. A distinction is made between intra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the brain) and extra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the skull but outside the brain). Intra-axial hemorrhage is due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage (blood in the ventricular system). The main types of extra-axial hemorrhage are epidural hematoma (bleeding between the dura mater and the skull), subdural hematoma (in the subdural space) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (between the arachnoid mater and pia mater). Most of the hemorrhagic stroke syndromes have specific symptoms (e.g., headache, previous head injury).  Symptoms and signs Symptoms often include: * Seizures, especially in newborns * Keeping one hand in a fist position, especially in infants * Worsening or sudden headaches * Sudden difficulty speaking, slurring of words or trouble understanding speech * Hemiparesis, or a weakness on one side of the body * Sudden loss of vision or abnormal eye movements * Sudden loss of balance or trouble walking  Prognosis  The prognosis for pediatric stroke survivors varies. The following are some common outcomes: * Cerebral Palsy (often Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy/Hemiplegia) * Epilepsy * Vision Loss * Hearing Loss  Treatment of Pediatric Stroke  * If symptoms of pediatric stroke seizure are seen, the infant should be taken to the hospital immediately for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. * Medications and other treatments may be recommended to help treat the symptoms (e.g. to control seizures) or correct the cause of the stroke, such as rehydration, antibiotics for meningitis, and, medication or surgery to correct heart abnormalities.

An English fleet under Sir Robert Mansell intercepted and attacked six Spanish galleys under the command of Federico Spinola; in the Dover Straits and was fought all the way off from the coast of England and finally off the Spanish Netherlands. The English were soon joined by a Dutch fleet under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant and they completed the destruction.Jaques p. 714 Background Federico Spinola In 1602 Frederico Spinola, younger brother of Ambrogio Spinola, had distinguished himself greatly as a soldier in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale.Wernham p. 269-72 Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Mart√≠n de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys. After this defeat Spinola took his remaining six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders he captured an English merchant ship, which he left at A Coru√±a.Fern√°ndez Duro, Ces√°reo: El Gran Duque de Osuna y su marina: jornadas contra turcos y venecianos. Spain: Renacimiento, 2006. , p. 296 At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola was on his way in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October.Bicheno pp. 298‚Äì99 Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see what they could do to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.J.P. Sigmond, 2013, Zeemacht in Holland en Zeeland in de zestiende eeuw, Hilversum, Verloren, pp 301-303 Engagement Mansell, with three ships (the 30 gun Hope along with the 42 gun Victory and the Answer) departed and patrolled about Dungeness. Mansell's flag captain came up with the strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.Coerbett pg 386-95 Action with the English Sir Robert Mansell In the moonlight of 3 October just before midnight Mansell was on the lookout for Spinola's galleys which were soon sighted. Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness Moon, Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys. Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round to face to the southeast, the direction of the Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship San Felipe (St. Philip) ran straight into the Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further east. Sources differ on what happened when the Spanish galleys came under fire of the English ships: from the English side it is asserted that the San Felipe was nearly battered into submission by Victory's guns and she was only able to escape when the other galleys came up in support drawing Victory's and Hope's fire. On the other hand, the Spanish have claimed that Spinola's galleys succeeded in passing almost unscathed between the English ships by rowing at full strength.Rodr√≠guez Villa, Antonio: Ambrosio Sp√≠nola, Primer Marqu√©s de los balbases. Madrid: Estab. tip. de Fortanet, 1905, pp. 36‚Äì37 Mansell decided on creating as much damage as possible; instead of concentrating on one galley, he ordered his gunners to blaze away at anything they saw in the moonlight and as a result he believed that damage was inflicted on most of the galleys. A number of galley slaves leapt into the sea from the damaged ships - a few even made it to shore where they were captured and interrogated at Dover Castle. By the time both fleets reached Goodwin Sands the Spanish galleys started to retreat in desperation for the Flemish coast. A gale was now blowing strongly from the west which favoured the pursuing English ships and soon the gunfire was a signal for the Dutch to engage. Dutch join the attack Dutch ships ram galleys The action continued across the Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon cut off the Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating itself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sank quickly, carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers. The Lucera, trying the same evasive tactic, was the next galley attacked; a Dutch galiot, which drove under full sail, managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the mainmast and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished the stern of the galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galiots were chasing two galleys: San Juan and Jacinto, which were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of this port. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape. Aftermath Casualties were exceptionally heavy for the Spanish; as two galleys sank with all hands, with perhaps over 2,000 were killed wounded or captured. At Calais the wrecked galley was chopped up and used as firewood by the French, the Spanish crew were interned and the galley slaves freed. Casualties for the Dutch and English were light with some ships suffering no casualties at all. Two Dutch ships were damaged in the ramming that took place but the rest of the Dutch ships suffered only minor damage. The English ships suffered no damage at all except for a broken mast on Samson due to the gale. The battle clearly showed the difference between galleons and galleys, in particular the uselessness of a Mediterranean type galley in Northern waters. The transition in warfare, along with the introduction of much cheaper cast iron guns in the 1580s, proved the \\"death knell\\" for the war galley as a significant military vessel.Guilmartin p. 254 Mansell was rewarded for his part in the victory and was named Vice-Admiral of the Narrow Seas in commemoration of the name of the battle. Van Duyvenvoorde and Cant both received honorary golden chains from the States of Holland. As for Spinola, he managed to save half of the galleys, as the two which had reached Nieuwpoort were soon able to join San Luis in Dunkirk.Fern√°ndez Duro, Ces√°reo: Armada espa√±ola desde la uni√≥n de los reinos de Castilla y de Arag√≥n. Vol. III. Instituto de Historia y Cultura Naval, p. 222 From there, the three ships sailed unmolested to Sluis, where Spinola with his five galleys still represented a threat to the English and Dutch shipping. Both the English and the Dutch were gradually able to gain supremacy in the seas not just in and around the English Channel but in all the European waters. As a result, Spinola would be defeated again and mortally wounded at the Battle of Sluys by the blockading Dutch forces in an attempt to escape. Spinola's death and the subsequent surrender of Sluis to the Dutch in 1604 ended his and Philip III's dreams, and English fears, of a galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders.

He was a prominent barrister and solicitor in Auckland and chaired several high-profile New Zealand boards. Early life and education Goldstine was born in Brisbane, Australia, but brought up and educated in Auckland, attending Auckland Grammar School. Goldstine studied law at Auckland University College. After serving his articles with William Joseph Napier he was admitted as a barrister of the Supreme Court of New Zealand on 18 February 1926. Career Barrister and solicitor Goldstine was a successful barrister and solicitor, and was described in court as displaying 'a doggedness and persistence which is noticeable even for a lawyer, and listeners have no cause to complain that his utterances are mumbled or indistinct'. Politics Goldstine became actively involved in local government at a young age. He was a member of the One Tree Hill Road Board in his twenties, and became its first deputy mayor when the board became a borough. Goldstine was elected mayor of One Tree Hill on 6 May 1931 at age 33, becoming New Zealand's youngest mayor. When elected it was noted that his standing in local body affairs is attested by the fact that he is president of the Suburban Local Bodies' Association and an authority on finance, gaining much praise by his analysis of the finances of the Hospital Board. During his time as mayor he was praised for continuing to reduce rates despite large increases in other regions. *In 1939 Goldstine and his council decided to plant 28 kauri trees along Aratonga Avenue, Greenlane to mark Arbor Day. They were the first local body to plant kauris in a street. The trees were planted by the Mayor and Mayoress, the deputy-Mayor and his wife, each of the One Tree Hill councilors and the town clerk, and local body and school representatives of the district. The trees were chosen because they would not grow fast enough to interfere with the power lines. It was agreed that by the time they reach that height, power lines would be underground. \\"And so will we!\\", Goldstine was quoted as saying. *Goldstine opposed a suggestion put forward that the name of One Tree Hill should be changed to Maungakiekie. He pointed out that the name One Tree Hill had been in use for more than a century, and the district took its name from the hill in 1873. He said the name Maungakiekie meant the hill of the kiekie plant, which no longer grew there, and the name was also difficult to pronounce correctly and would cause confusion. George Graham, the secretary of the Akarana Maori Association, also agreed that the name One Tree Hill should be retained. *Sir John Logan Campbell bequeathed ¬£5000 for an obelisk on the summit of One Tree Hill as a memorial to MƒÅori. Prior to its construction, the One Tree Hill council suggested the funds be diverted to provide finance for swimming baths in Cornwall Park because of engineering difficulties in erecting the obelisk. Goldstine opposed this, stating that the money had been set aside for a specific purpose, and if it were impossible to conform with Campbell's wishes, the council should adhere to his wishes as near as practicable. Goldstine presided as mayor during construction of the obelisk which was completed in 1940, although the unveiling was delayed until after World War II on 24 April 1948. This was in keeping with MƒÅori custom of not holding such ceremonies during a time of bloodshed. Goldstine held the position of Mayor until his retirement from politics in 1947. Business ;Auckland Metropolitan Milk Council Goldstine served as chair of the Milk Council for 10 years. This time coincided with World War II, and a lot of his time was spent overseeing the restrictions on the sale of cream, the delivery of milk to schools, and ensuring milk delivery to homes continued with the ongoing petrol rationing and delivery men serving in the war. ;Local Government Commission The first Local Government Commission commission was established in 1947 to reform New Zealand's 695 local commissions, which was considered too many for a country with a population of 1.5 million people. New Zealand Labour Party MP Bill Parry appointed Goldstine as chair of the Commission. In this position, Goldstine enjoyed the salary and privileges of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and was known as Judge Goldstine. The commission adopted the Court's strict dress code of wigs and gowns, somewhat to the dismay of the Law Society. Goldstine held this position until his sudden death in 1953. ;Other business Goldstine was Vice President of the New Zealand Municipal Association, member for 14 years of the Auckland Suburban Drainage Board and chairman for two and a half years of the Auckland (NZ) Armed Forces Appeal Board. During World War II Goldstine was appointed to the National Patriotic Fund Board and the National Patriotic Council. He became deputy chairman of the Auckland Provincial Patriotic Council.

Honorific eponym *Margot Street, Epsom, New Zealand, was renamed from Williamson Street in 1933 after Goldstine's daughter. *Goldstine Place, Epsom, New Zealand, was created and named in 1996 when the former Transport Board Workshops site was subdivided. Personal life Goldstine married Dora Solomon in 1924. Goldstine and Solomon had two children, John and Margot. Solomon died on 20 August 1939, aged 38. She was actively associated with Goldstine's public activities; just prior to her death she had been convener of the Women's Emergency Precautions Committee of Epsom and One Tree Hill. Upon learning of her death, the chairman of the Auckland Transport Board, W. H. Nagle, paid tribute to the charitable, philanthropic and civic activities of Solomon and her devotion to humanitarian causes. Goldstine was better known among friends and colleagues as 'Izzy', and was known for his sense of humor while conducting business. Goldstine showed a fondness for sport and particularly enjoyed watching tennis and football. In his earlier years he played football as an Auckland representative. He frequently played golf in Maungakiekie and was quoted as saying: \\"I have no pretensions to being a 'real' golfer, but I live in hope of reducing my handicap some day.\\" Goldstine traveled frequently to Australia, which often influenced his ideas in politics and business.

The escape involved one-third of the population: 150‚Äì200 families (at least one thousand people). Among the privileges granted the city council of Martina in 1495, King Frederick of Aragon forbade Jews and Crypto-Jews and Neofiti to press charges against those who robbed them (probably during the riots of 1494‚Äì1495 during the French invasion of the Kingdom of Naples) and prohibited their coming to live in that city. Also in 1495, the Jews of Martina Franca were massacred. Traces of the Jews: synagogue, neighborhood and cemetery The area where the Jews used to live is the one between \\"u'Curdunnidde\\" and Vico Montedoro (this is a Jewish name, present also in Taranto and Naples). Before the anti- Semite laws (1938), the population called that area Giudecca (the Jewish quarter). There was a synagogue at the foot of Montedoro; it might be the present cloister of St. Dominic. The Jewish cemetery was outside the walls. Perhaps the cloister of St. Anthony is all that is left. Face of a Jew? Site in Vico San Giuliano, Martina Franca Bibliography * A.

He became a sugar merchant in Stockport and had two sons, Geoffrey and Hugh, with his wife Frances. Climbing Pigott climbed extensively with Morley Wood, mostly leading. They pioneered many routes in the Peak District including Stanage Edge and The Roaches and he later moved to mountains including new routes at Glen Coe, Ben Nevis, the Inaccessible Pinnacle and the 3rd ascent of the central buttress of Scafell in 1923. Pigott's Climb (VS, 5a, 1924) on the East Buttress of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu set new standards for exposure. Jack Longland wrote 'it was impossible to ruffle him or to imagine him flustered, much less frightened'. Pigott was a member of The Rucksack Club including being its president for two years and on its committee from 1921 to 1971 without interruption. He was a pioneer with Morley Wood of using natural chockstones and later machine nuts for protection. He wrote a chapter in the book Recent Developments on Gritstone.

About two years after this book was first published in 2011, its author was elected as President of Iran on 15 June 2013. In this book, he has focused on Iran's nuclear program and challenges created by the Western countries, especially the United States and three European countries of France, Germany and United Kingdom, during 678 days (from October 6, 2003 to August 15, 2005) when he and his team were handling Iran's nuclear case. The history of Iran's nuclear technology and the process of achieving complete nuclear fuel cycle are major topics of the book. This is the first book written by a high-ranking Iranian official who was once leading Iran's nuclear negotiating team. Other memoirs have been also published on Iran's nuclear case including by Mohamed ElBaradei (former Director-General of IAEA), Joschka Fischer (former German foreign minister), Jack Straw (former British foreign secretary), and Hossein Mousavian (a former member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team).  Chapters  This book includes 12 chapters and seven appendices: # Islamic Revolution and Nuclear Technology (1979-2003) # Challenges and Structures # Nuclear Tension and New Requisites (August 2002 ‚Äì October 2003) # Addressing threats to National Security (October 2003 ‚Äì January 2004) # New Crisis and Enhanced Efforts # Diplomacy in Crisis (August 2004 ‚Äì December 2004) # Paris Agreement # Beginning of Negotiations and a Chance to Create Opportunity # New Hopes # Distrust and Doubt # Changing Red Lines # Achievements of 678 Days of Endeavor :* Appendix ::# Chronology of Iran‚Äôs nuclear case ::# Farewell ::# Documents: Agreements, negotiations and letters ::# Resolutions ::# IAEA Director-General reports ::# Press conferences ::# Speeches  Contents  National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy has been compiled in 12 chapters and 7 appendices in 1,209 pages and is the first comprehensive book so far published on Iran's nuclear energy program, and is considered an oral history book. The first chapter, entitled Islamic Revolution and Nuclear Technology (1979-2003), includes seven sections. It focuses on the outset of nuclear technology following the Islamic Revolution and explains Iran's need to nuclear energy and the necessity of producing nuclear fuel and enriching uranium. The author has discussed the extension of Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1995, signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and their relations to the issue of developing nuclear technology. High Council for Modern Technologies and the Council's decision to start building an enrichment facility in Natanz in 2000 have been also explained in this chapter. The second chapter, entitled Challenges and Structures, includes 18 sections which introduce the structure of decision-making in Iran, especially the role of the Supreme National Security Council, the process of making important national decisions by this institution, especially about the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, and its role in the nuclear case as well as its relations with other concerned institutions and authorities. Chapter three is about Evolution of Nuclear Tension and New Requisites (August 2002-October 2003). It includes six sections in which the author expounds how Iran's nuclear case ended in the labyrinth of problems of the IAEA and European countries, while explaining the atmosphere surrounding Iran's nuclear case before he was appointed in charge of the nuclear team. Chapter four, Eliminating National Security Threats (October 2003 ‚Äì November 2003), consists of 15 sections which tell the memories of the author as he started off as head of the nuclear team within the Supreme National Security Council. The author has noted that this phase of his work was focused on calming the situation down, eliminating threats and establishing contacts with other involved parties, including the IAEA, ElBaradei, and the three European countries. The most important part of this chapter is a detailed account of Saadabad negotiations and declaration (in Tehran) as well as the political environments in and out of Iran. In the fifth chapter, New Crisis and Enhanced Efforts, which contains seven sections, the author explains how the crisis resulting from Atomic Energy Organization of Iran's first incomplete report to the IAEA, especially its omission to refer to the blueprints of the second-generation (P2) centrifuges was managed. It also deals with problems caused for Iran by Libya's submission to the demands of the US and the UK. It also delineates how this crisis was changed into an opportunity through conclusion of Brussels agreement. The author also explains domestic and international grounds which helped Iran to reduce the impact of March and June 2004 resolutions of the IAEA Board of Governors by signing Brussels agreement which raised the possibility of removing Iran's case from the IAEA's agenda. He also gives an account of why Iran's case was not normalized. In the sixth chapter, Diplomacy in Crisis (August 2004 ‚Äì December 2004), the author focuses on the marathon of exchanging plans between Iran and Europe. He also explains the breathtaking confrontation between Iran and the United States over the normalization of Iran's nuclear case, on the one hand, and preventing the case from being reported to the United Nations Security Council, on the other hand. This chapter also gives an account of domestic differences in Iran, impatience shown for the beginning of uranium enrichment, and the role of active diplomacy which provided political and international grounds for Paris agreement. The seventh chapter, entitled Paris Agreement, contains nine sections which concentrate on domestic and international conditions and explain how Iran's case was removed from the Quarterly agenda of the IAEA Board of Governors following the Paris agreement and was not reported to the Security Council. The author expounds the impact of Paris agreement on political and economic conditions in the country and necessary decisions which were taken to handle possible failure of the negotiations. Chapter eight, Beginning of Negotiations and a Chance to Create Opportunity, has seven sections in which the author elaborates on negotiations with presidents of Russia and France, and the German chancellor, the performance of three working groups which were established following Paris agreement, and provision of ‚Äúobjective guarantees‚Äù about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear energy program. On the other hand, the author explains Iran's conditions for leaving negotiations and shows how the start of election campaigns in Iran was regarded as an important challenge to the nuclear case. In the ninth chapter, New Hopes, which has six sections, the author analyzes foot-dragging by Europeans during expert-level negotiations and also explains Iran's initiative for offering a four-stage plan for industrial-level enrichment in early days of the Iranian calendar year, 1384 (starting March 21, 2005). In this chapter, the author also gives an account of US pressures, Europe's submissiveness before the US, and also domestic developments in Iran as a result of the presidential election, which collectively increased the pace of change in Iran's strategy. The political grounds for Iran's decision to resume work at Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) in Isfahan, negotiations of the Steering Committee in London (in late April 2005), and announcement of the inauguration of UCF on April 30, 2005, have been also explained. In chapter ten, which is entitled Distrust and Doubt and has 10 sections, the focus is on international consequences of Iran's decision to launch the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF), including a letter written by three European foreign ministers; contacts with Thabo Mbeki (then South African president), Kofi Annan (then Secretary-General of the UN) and Chinese and Russian officials and their recommendations to Iran to postpone the inauguration of the UCF; receiving the final European plan; the trip to Geneva; and the last negotiations with three European foreign ministers. It also explains the plan prepared by Iran to work with like-minded countries instead of pursuing agreement with the European states, after the final efforts by the Steering Committee in London failed. In chapter eleven, Changing Red Lines, the author reflects on the efforts made by the nuclear negotiating team under his lead and also explains a three-faceted strategy. This chapter also contains an account of the resumption of operation at Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) in Isfahan, introduction of the new nuclear team, and comparison between the situation at the beginning and the end of the period of Hassan Rouhani's nuclear team. In chapter twelve, Achievements of 678 Days of Endeavor, the author offers a recap of all preceding chapters and, in three sections, he deals with nuclear goals, strategies and achievements of Iran during the time he led the nuclear team. There are seven appendices at the end of the book which include chronology of Iran's nuclear case, documents (agreements, negotiations and letters), text of resolutions, text of reports prepared by the IAEA Director-General, as well as the text of a number of press conferences and speeches by Hassan Rouhani and other high-ranking Iranian officials.  Opinions about the book  National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy was presented in bookstores without any unveiling ceremony and simply after limited introduction on a few websites. Therefore, most media and critics actually did not know about it for quite a time. However, after an interview with Hassan Rouhani by Mehrnameh magazine in May 2012, the book hit the headlines not only in domestic print media, but also in their counterparts outside the country, including the BBC Persian TV, and many critiques were written about it. Most critiques can be divided into two main categories. The first group lauded the book for its comprehensiveness and the ground breaking views and analysis. The second group complained about revelation of secret documents as well as the book's coverage of the concerns among Iranian officials and domestic issues. They noted that such information might be exploited by the negotiating parties opposing Iran and concluded that publication of the book has been a dis-service to the country's interests and national security. They also stated that the book is one-sided and the author has omitted some facts which were not in line with his or his team's interests. In a preface to the first edition of the book, the author wrote that he had done his best to provide an honest account of what happened during his tenure. However, he added, as the nuclear case still continued, he had taken many considerations into account when writing the book. One year after the publication of the book, none of the high-ranking Iranian officials have publicly spoken or written about the book and its contents.  Positive points  Iran's nuclear program entails the most complicated and fateful international crisis Iran has had to face, second only to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Rouhani's memoir are important in that they focus on an issue which is still among the most important topics of discussion, taking into account that the consequences of the decisions made by Iranian leaders and high-ranking officials on this issue still continue and have been tied to the fate of 75 million Iranians. On the other hand, the book's relative comprehensiveness, which has been enhanced by adding the text of negotiations and other relevant documents, has made it rank among oral history books. The process of making decisions in Iran's political structure on fateful and historical issues, the way those decisions are rounded up, and the impact of personal views of various officials on those decisions have been elaborated in Rouhani's memoir. In addition, these memoir include readable and important details of the method and the content of negotiations between Iran's nuclear team and European sides, which make a thorough judgment about the performance of the nuclear team and decisions made by the Iranian leaders possible.  Negative points  Absence of a glossary of technical terms so as to let the readers know about how the nuclear fuel cycle is achieved and how such terms as UF6, UF4, UCF, and P1 and P2 centrifuges are different. Absence of suitable and relevant photos as well as a summary part at the beginning or the end of every chapter is another weakness. The contents of the book are apparently a combination of dictated and written parts as a result of which certain topics have been frequently, and unnecessarily, repeated throughout the text.  Print and publication  National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy was first published by the Expediency Council's Center for Strategic Research in 999 pages in fall of 2011, but was introduced and distributed in April 2012. The second edition of the book ‚Äúwith corrections‚Äù was published in 1027 pages in spring of 2012. The third edition ‚Äúwith additional contents‚Äù came out in summer of 2012. It included the text of negotiations with the foreign ministers of three European states in Tehran and Brussels, the text of negotiations with ElBaradei, as well as the text of news conferences and speeches by Rouhani, which increased the book's size to 1209 pages. The fourth and fifth reprints of the book came out in fall of 2012 and winter of 2013.  Narration of Foresight and Hope  Excerpts from National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy were published in March 2013, entitled Narration of Foresight and Hope, along with photos of nuclear negotiations in 552 pages. In the preface of the book, the author has noted that in line with the old saying, ‚Äúfewer words can make the point,‚Äù he had decided to print excerpts from the main book as an independent volume to be used by those readers who lack enough time to go through the original volume.

Opened in 1967, it stands on a piece of land closely associated with North Dakota's history and settlement and is named after General Henry Sibley. It covers an area of , and the site is a popular recreation spot and campground. History of the site Park entrance Once called Burnt Boat Island, the land where General Sibley Park stands was known for the steamboat The Assiniboine that grounded and was destroyed by fire in the early 1830s. While it is no longer an island due to changes in the course of the Missouri River, evidence of the river channel can still be found along the northern perimeter of the site. In 1862, broken treaties and fear of starvation led Dakotas to attack settlers and soldiers along the Minnesota River in southwestern Minnesota. In retaliation for the loss of life and property, General Sibley and General Alfred Sully were dispatched with U.S. troops to pursue the bands assumed responsible for the assaults. Sibley and Sully sought retribution by leading their troops to the present vicinity of General Sibley Park. On July 29, 1863, Dakotas and Lakotas encamped along bluffs of the Missouri River and Apple Creek engaged in a confrontation with Sibley‚Äôs troops, resulting in a loss of lives for both sides.Gilman, Rhoda (2004). Henry Hastings Sibley: Divided Heart. Minnesota Historical Society. P. 199 Facing food shortages and exhaustion from their long journey, Sibley‚Äôs troops returned to Minnesota. Sully‚Äôs troops remained in the Dakota Territory for several months, and attacked guilty and innocent bands alike, killing women and children, and burning food, supplies and transportation. This response provided settlers with a sense of security and brought greater confidence in business and transportation development, but were devastating for the Dakotas and, as conflicts with the U.S. government continued westward and increased, tribes faced conflicts and displacement through what is collectively referred to as the Sioux Wars. Playground, General Sibley Park Development of the park The 138-acre area had previously been used by the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts for activities and training, and developing the site into a more formalised recreation spot attracted strong support from conservation group the Izaak Walton League, Burleigh County and the City of Bismarck. It was officially opened as a public park on May 26, 1967.Bismarck Tribune. ‚ÄúTo Dedicate State‚Äôs Newest Outdoor Spot.‚Äù May 26, 1967. North Dakota State Historical Society, State Archives Development of the area had also involved collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps, which still owns the site although it is managed by Bismarck Parks and Recreation District.http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/ndfs/General_Sibley_Park_Assessment_10_25_11_FINAL_DRAFT.pdf General Sibley Park today Also known as General Sibley Park and Campground, the area now includes 114 RV sites, a separate section for tent camping, two shower houses, and a day-use park with two picnic shelters, a volleyball court and a children's playground. There is also a 24-hole frisbee disc golf course. A boat dock is located at the south-east corner of the park. There are some 100,000 visitors each year, with 60 per cent of them living within a radius of of the park, according to a 2011 report. It also attracts visitors from other states and from Canada. The vast majority of trees found in the park are green ash, with some cottonwood and boxelder. In May 2011, the park was inundated with floodwaters from the Missouri River, with water levels reaching their peak of on July 1, 2011. Once the flood had abated, Bismarck Parks and Recreation District commissioned a visual survey of the damage caused by saturated soil conditions and wind storms. Over 1,200 trees had been toppled or partially uprooted. The report concluded that replanting should increase the diversity of tree species to reduce the losses if an insect or disease were to enter the park, and also ensure introduction of species with known tolerance of flooding. Campgrounds were closed for the season while the cleanup took place. By November 2011, around three-quarters of damaged and fallen trees had been removed by forestry crews.

Construction and commissioning The ship was ordered in April 1916 for delivery in April 1917, and was initially intended to be named HMS Montrose; her keel was laid down on 25 May 1916 by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton, Scotland. During September 1916 she was renamed HMS ValorousDittmar & Colledge, British Warships 1914-1919, p.73. and she was launched under that name on 8 May 1917. She was completed on 21 August 1917 and commissioned the same day. Service history World War I Upon completion, Valorous entered service with the fleet during World War I. Before the Armistice with Germany ended the war on 11 November 1918, she had been converted for use as minelayer. Interwar After the conclusion of World War I, Valorous deployed to the Baltic Sea to participate in the British campaign there against Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War, seeing action against Russian warships. In 1919, she and the destroyer severely damaged the Bolshevik submarine , which barely made it back to base at Kronstadt. In 1921 she began service in the Atlantic Fleet and later was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until relieved there in 1931, when the flotilla leader was decommissioned and placed in reserve. In 1938, the Royal Navy selected Valorous for conversion into an anti-aircraft escort under the naval rearmament programme, and she entered Chatham Dockyard for the required work. Upon its completion in June 1939, she was recommissioned, and in August 1939 was assigned to the escort force at Rosyth, Scotland. World War II When the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, Valorous took up convoy defence duties in the North Sea and Northwestern Approaches with Rosyth Force. In January 1940 her duties were expanded to include the defence of convoys along the east coast of Great Britain and in the English Channel. She did not take part in the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk, France, remaining on convoy escort duties instead. On 11 June 1940, she was escorting Convoy FN 23 when it came under German air attack and, after a German bomb hit sank the collier Heworth, rescued Heworths crew. In July 1940, Valorouss duties expanded again to include anti-invasion patrols. In 1941, after the threat of invasion had subsided, she returned to her convoy escort focus. On 21 June 1941 the flotilla leader rescued the only three survivors of the tanker Vancouver, which had struck a naval mine and caught fire off Sunk Head Buoy, Harwich, with the loss of 45 lives while on a voyage from Shell Haven to Halifax, Yorkshire. Valorous was \\"adopted\\" by the civil community of Dewsbury, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, as the result of a Warship Week National Savings campaign in October 1941. Valorous interrupted her regular duties in January 1942 to take part in Operation Performance, deploying with the Home Fleet to cover the break-out of merchant ships from Sweden into the North Sea via the Danish Straits. Fitted with a Type 285 fire-control radar for her main armament in 1942 and with Type 286P radar and direction-finding equipment in 1943‚Äì1944, the vessel continued her convoy defense duties through the surrender of Germany in early May 1945, not taking part in any operations related to the Allied invasion of Normandy in the summer of 1944. After Germany's surrender, Valorous supported reoccupation forces, and on 14 May 1945 joined the destroyer in escorting minesweepers during minesweeping operations at Kristiansund, Norway. Decommissioning and disposal Valorous was decommissioned in 1945 ‚Äì sources differ on whether she had been deleted from the Royal Navys active list as of July 1945 or stayed in commission until after the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945 ‚Äì and placed on the disposal list in 1946. She was sold on 4 March 1947 for scrapping at Thornaby.

On her first voyage in 1800 she was on her way to Bengal and Bencoolen when the French privateer Robert Surcouf captured her near the mouth of the Ganges. Capture Kent left Torbay on 3 May 1800. She was under the command of Robert Rivington, who sailed under a letter of marque dated 28 March 1800.Letter of Marque, p.71 - accessed 25 July 2017. At St. Salvador, she took on 300 persons, including troops and passengers, the survivors of the East Indiaman Queen, which had caught fire there and been destroyed, with in excess of 100 fatalities.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp. 344‚Äì5 Queen and Kent had left Torbay on the same day.Hardy & Hardy (1811), p. 202 On 7 October Kent encountered the French privateer brig , of 18 guns and 150 men, under the command of Robert Surcouf.Levot, p. 495 East Indiaman Kent battling Confiance, a privateer vessel commanded by French corsair Robert Surcouf in October 1800, as depicted in a painting by Ambroise Louis Garneray French account At some point Kent had rescued the crew and passengers of another ship, destroyed by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement.Hennequin, p. 384 Including passengers, among whom there were some 100 soldiers, she had 437 persons aboard which was more than four times its normal complement. Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent, causing great confusion, and seized control of Kent. The British had 14 men killed, including Rivington, and 44 wounded, while the French suffered five men killed and ten wounded. British account Account of the capture of Kent in The Gentleman's Magazine, October 1800 James reports that Kent fought for almost two hours and that Rivington was killed by a shot to the head as the French boarded. He states that Kents armament consisted of twenty 12-pounders, and six 6-pounders on her castles, and that Confiances armament consisted of between 20 and 22 long 8-pounder guns. He speculates that if Kent had carried 18 or 24-pounder carronades instead of the long 6-pounders, she might have been able to use grapeshot to deter boarding. He further reports that in addition to her crew of 100 or so, she had some 38 male and three female passengers, including seven or eight passengers that she had picked up at St. Salvador, after a fire there had destroyed the Indiaman Queen on 9 July. Apparently some four or five passengers were among the British dead, and there were also passengers among the wounded. James attributes the crew being overwhelmed by the boarders to a shortage of swords, pikes and pistols.James (1837), Vol. 3, p. 31 Another account estimates the number of persons on Kent as under 200, and gives the casualties as 11 killed and 44 wounded on the British side, and 16 wounded (of whom three later died), on the French side.Laughton (1889), pp. 438‚Äì442 The passengers included General St. John, his wife, three daughters, two other women, and St. John's aide, Captain Pilkington, who had been wounded. Surcouf put them into a passing Arab merchantman and they arrived shortly thereafter in Calcutta. Aftermath Surcouf put his first officer, Joachim Drieux, aboard Kent, together with a 60-man prize crew. Surcouf released the passengers on a merchantman that he stopped a few days later.Rouvier, p. 527 Confiance and Kent arrived at the Rade des Pavillons in Port Louis, Mauritius, in November.Cunat, p. 398 The capture of Kent became a sensation, and the British Admiralty promised a large reward for the capture of Surcouf. Her captors sold Kent for 30,900 piastres to a Danish shipping company, which renamed her Cronberg.Review 1842), pp. 178‚Äì9 She left Mauritius on 21 March 1801, but as she approached Denmark passing vessels informed her that a British fleet had attacked Copenhagen; she therefore waited for some weeks off the coast of Norway before it was safe to proceed, and arrived in Kristiansand in June 1801, and later at Copenhagen on 16 July.Cleveland (1843), pp. 135, 143‚Äì4 The EIC put the value of its cargo lost on Kent at ¬£28,676.Reports...

He is an accountant by profession. An official investigation of Bernal's finances began while he was at Itaip√∫ and continued into his years in the Senate. An attempt was made to impeach him, and both he and his wife, Mar√≠a Elizabeth Pleva, spent years engaged in legal battles over charges of embezzlement. CEO of Itaip√∫ Bernal was appointed Paraguayan director of Itaip√∫ in September 2003. Itaip√∫, which is jointly owned by Brazil and Paraguay, describes itself as ‚Äúthe largest power producer in the world‚Äù and says that its mission is to ‚Äúgenerate quality electricity via socially and environmentally responsible practices, and to foster sustainable economic, tourist, and technological development in Brazil and Paraguay.‚Äù Its energy source is the Itaip√∫ Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric dam, which is located on the Paran√° River on the border between Brazil and Paraguay. The dam was named one of the seven wonders of the modern world in 1994 by the American Society of Civil Engineers. During his tenure at Itaip√∫, under President Nicanor Duarte Frutos, Bernal was one of the most influential figures in Paraguayan politics. Bernal relatives employed by Itaip√∫ Bernal's wife, Mar√≠a Elizabeth Pleva, served as assistant Paraguayan director of Itaip√∫ under Bernal, and his brother Oscar was on the staff of Itaip√∫'s Retirement and Pension Fund, a job that, according to the Paraguayan newspaper ABC, Itaip√∫, involved little or no work. His nephew Luis Ben√≠tez Bernal worked in Human Resources at Itaip√∫; a cousin, Jos√© Luis Bernal Sanabria, worked for Itaip√∫'s Tes√£i Foundation; another cousin, Nilda Garay Pereira, worked for Itaip√∫'s pension fund, a job that was described by ABC as having ‚Äúno known functions‚Äù; Luis Francisco Pereira Vigo, a nephew of Bernal's first wife, worked as an assistant to Bernal. As of 2007, Bernal's son Hugo, who was in his twenties, was reportedly earning a high salary as an adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Paraguay, even though he was not a career diplomat, which is ordinarily a requirement for such positions. Salary During his time at Itaip√∫, Bernal earned a total of G 4,004,670,277 in salary, and his wife earned G 1,596,560,135. They also made G 1,000,000,000 from selling property. Controversial lifestyle Beginning on 9 September 2007, ABC ran a series of articles about the Bernal family. The first article, headlined ‚ÄúPornographic display of wealth by Victor Bernal and his family,‚Äù began by listing several examples to illustrate the Bernal family's opulent lifestyle. In the concluding article in the series, the \\"new 'royalty'\\" was said to have replaced the \\"old 'barons'\\". It was noted that Pleva enjoyed a ‚Äútitle and salary at Itaip√∫, plus a vehicle, driver, fuel, and bodyguards.‚Äù In an October 2007 article about Bernal's acquisition of wealth and land, it was noted that his property and money were the result of \\"miraculous multiplication\\". On just two properties, Bernal had spent G 1,300 million, almost twice his annual salary of G 720 million. Resignation Bernal resigned from Itaip√∫ in January 2008 to run for the Paraguayan senate, and was paid G 303,266,890 by Itaip√∫ in compensation for his period of service. On 17 January, President Nicanor Duarte announced that Ram√≥n Romero Roa would replace Bernal. Senator In the Paraguayan general election on 20 April 2008, Bernal was elected to the Senate. Committees In the Senate, Bernal has sat on the following permanent committees: *Hacienda, Presupuesto y Cuentas - 2008-9, 2009‚Äì10, 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 *Energ√≠a, Recursos Naturales, Poblaci√≥n, Ambiente, Producci√≥n y Desarrollo Sostenible - 2008-9, 2009‚Äì10, 2011‚Äì12, 2012-13 *Econom√≠a, Cooperativismo, Desarrollo e Integraci√≥n Econ√≥mica Latinoamericana - 2009-10, 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12, 2012-13 *Cuentas y Control de la Administraci√≥n Financiera del Estado - 2011-12, 2012‚Äì13 He has sat on the following bicameral committee: *C.Bicameral Encargada del Estudio del Presupuesto General de la Naci√≥n, Ejercicio Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2012 Senatorial activities and related events Bernal denounced the Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture, and Education in May 2012 for using their resources for political purposes. A large group of young people gathered outside Bernal's home in June 2012 to protest his involvement in the impeachment of President Fernando Lugo. Bernal called in January 2013 for an end to negotiations between the Paraguayan government and the power company Rio Tinto Alcan, questioning the price the firm was charging for energy. Legal difficulties During his tenure as CEO of Itaip√∫, and also during his subsequent service in the Paraguayan Senate, Bernal has been the subject of several different investigations and prosecutions based on his activities while working at Itaip√∫. He was investigated for overcharging for public-works projects in the town of Minga Guaz√∫ that were paid for by Itaip√∫; for diverting Itaip√∫ assets to finance campaigns by Colorado Party candidates in 2007 and 2008; for misusing public-works funds; for embezzling; and for using Itaip√∫-owned assets to purchase equipment for the Tes√£i Foundation. ABC noted on 5 March 2008 that Bernal had bought space in its pages to deny facts that the paper had reported about his use of funds from Itaip√∫ that were supposed to be spent on public-works projects in the town of Minga Guaz√∫ in Alto Paran√°. Yet Bernal had ‚Äúnot offered a single document in proof‚Äù of his claims. By contrast, ABC maintained, the evidence of his guilt was ample. ABC added that ‚ÄúBernal said yesterday that this daily had cut off contact with him. This is false. For a year, we have sought answers to simple questions about the use of the binational's funds. He has not yet granted an interview. Or responded to our questionnaires.‚Äù Prosecutor Sergio Alegre of the Attorney General's Office asked Judge Ruben Ayala Brun on 16 April 2008 to dismiss an embezzlement complaint filed against Bernal by public advocate Edgar Villalba and by Gerardo Rol√≥n Pose and Nils Candia Gini, presidents of the Democratic and Revolutionary Febrerista parties, respectively. The prosecutor requested the dismissal because a study of Bernal's and his wife's finances indicated that their joint legal income over a period of years had exceeded their expenditures, a finding which, if confirmed, would leave Ayala Brun with no choice other than to dismiss the charges. Ayala Brun asked the Attorney General to ratify or rectify the opinion, whereupon deputy prosecutor Carlos Arregui, head of the Economic Crime and Anti-Corruption Unit, intervened, arguing that there were points that had to be investigated before the complaint could be dismissed or a criminal case opened. It was reported on 24 April 2008 that the Attorney General had ten working days, beginning on 23 April, to respond to the prosecutor's request to dismiss the case. The Prosecutors' Office was accused of making an ‚Äúundisguised attempt to launder the new Colorado Senator Victor Bernal,‚Äù as demonstrated by the unusual speed with which Alegre had upheld the embezzlement complaint dismissal against Bernal. Noting that Alegre had ignored evidence that ABC itself had supplied in earlier articles, Reinfeldt described the prosecution as ‚Äúone of the poorest‚Äù Alegre had ever carried out, and noted that the judge had ‚Äúbounced‚Äù Alegre twice ‚Äúin a desperate attempt to secure a better investigation....Through negligence or ignorance, or deliberately, Alegre has ignored fundamental principles that are employed in the judiciary to carry out a proper investigation of embezzlement that encompasses everyone in the closest ring surrounding Bernal.‚Äù Alegre was informed on 8 May 2008 by Arregui that the latter would continue to pursue a prosecution of Bernal for embezzlement during his tenure at Itaip√∫. On 16 May 2008, Arregui announced that he was opening a criminal investigation into Bernal's use of public-works funds, and said that he had jurisdiction to investigate acts by Itaip√∫ in Paraguay. Luis Alberto Franco wrote a letter to Alegre in June 2008 denying charges that he was a front man for Bernal. A September 2008 overview of government corruption in Paraguay mentioned Bernal as a ‚Äúman of humble origin‚Äù who in slightly over five years had become ‚Äúan owner of mansions and ranches‚Äù and joined the list of Paraguay's leading billionaires, and who now, as a recently elected Senator, enjoyed ‚Äúparliamentary immunity.‚Äù It was reported on 2 September 2008 that Bernal, while serving as CEO of Itaip√∫, had violated its internal controls by personally authorizing millions in disbursements without any verification. After an audit by Ram√≥n Romero Roa, also a former Itaip√∫ director, Bernal was investigated for diverting more than G 34 billion from Itaip√∫ to the Tes√¢i Foundation. Itaip√∫'s Paraguayan director, Carlos Mateo Balmelli, accused Bernal and Ramon Roa, another former Itaip√∫ director, on 21 October 2008, of embezzling about 34 billion Gs. Mateo said that Itaip√∫'s lawyers had requested the impeachment of Bernal in order to ‚Äúfacilitate the investigation.‚Äù On the same date Mateo made public a report on the Tes√£i Foundation, which, according to an external audit, had been used to drain funds from Itaip√∫. It was reported on 4 November 2008, that four companies apparently hired by Itaip√∫ during Bernal's tenure to do campaign work for the Colorado Party had billed Itaip√∫ a total of over G 22 billion (U.S. $4.7 million). The firms were operated under the direction of Alejandro (Sasha) Evreinoff, brother-in-law of Wilfrido Taboada, Itaip√∫'s CFO and Bernal's right-hand man. In late November 2008, lawyers for Bernal, appearing before the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, appealed the decision of State Attorney General Ruben Candia Amarilla to appoint Rocio Vallejo to investigate illegal political funding during Bernal's tenure at Itaip√∫. Meanwhile, Arregui ordered Acu√±a to continue looking into the alleged campaign funding. Judge Patricia Gonz√°lez was appointed in December 2008 to adjudicate a case brought against Bernal by prosecutor Gustavo Gamba, who accused him of squandering funds intended to be transferred from Itaip√∫ to Minga Guaz√∫ for public-works projects. On 10 December, Bernal was charged with breach of trust for his leadership of Itaip√∫. On 11 December Gonz√°lez said that she would seek Bernal's impeachment. On 18 December, Gonz√°lez sent a message to the Paraguayan Congress ordering that Bernal be impeached by the Senate for breach of trust. On 19 December Gonzalez approved Bernal's application for parliamentary immunity, while Gamba insisted that impeachment proceedings against Bernal go forward. The Paraguayan Court of Appeals decided on 10 February 2009 to take on the case against Bernal in the matter of the Minga Guaz√∫ funds. Acu√±a refused on 19 February 2009 to dismiss a complaint that Bernal, in 2006, while serving as director of Itaip√∫, had ordered the purchase for $450,000 of an MRI scanner that became unusable after a brief period. The charge was part of the case involving the Tes√£i Foundation. As of May 2009, the charges against Bernal relating to the use of Itaip√∫ funds to pay Colorado Party campaign expenses were being officially investigated by Evreinoff. Prosecutors taped Bernal on 3 June 2009 delivering an initial payment of $90,000 to Gamba in return for Gamba's promise to dismiss one of five cases pending against Bernal involving his reported misuse of funds while serving as director of the Itaip√∫. On 8 June 2009, it was reported that Gamba would be prosecuted on charges of seeking a bribe from Bernal. Allegedly, Gamba, acting through lawyer Juan Portillo, had demanded a payout of $150,000, with a first payment of $90,000, in exchange for dropping the case against Bernal. Bernal reported Gamba to the authorities, and the prosecutor was secretly filmed accepting money. The head of Itaip√∫, Carlos Mateo Balmelli, told Radio Primero de Marzo in June 2009 that Bernal had spent five million dollars on social events during his tenure at Itaip√∫ and that he, Mateo, would be filing charges against Bernal with Attorney General Amarilla. It was reported on 9 July 2009 that Gamba had been replaced as prosecutor on the Minga Guaz√∫ case by Eduardo Cazenave, who was planning to travel to Alto Paran√° to investigate the disappearance of G. 380,418,219 in funds designated for Minga Guaz√∫. The same article reported that the proceedings against Bernal were stalled in the Supreme Court. The Criminal Chamber of the Paraguayan Supreme Court, ruling in favor of a motion by Bernal, removed Arregui and fellow prosecutors Rocio Vallejo and Arnaldo Giuzzio on 15 July 2009 from the case against Bernal on which they had been working. It was reported on 23 June 2009 that the director of Itaip√∫ had requested that investigations of Bernal being carried out by the Economic Crimes and Corruption Unit be transferred to the public prosecutor's office, but Amarilla expressed support for the unit and ordered that the investigations remain in its hands. Prosecutor Victoria Acu√±a of the Economic Crimes Unit announced on 30 July 2009 that she was investigating the alleged use of Itaip√∫ funds during Bernal's tenure to pay campaign expenses incurred by the Colorado Party in the 2008 general elections. Prosecutors accused Gamba on 4 December 2009 of soliciting a $150,000 bribe from Bernal. Gamba was suspended from his position, while Bernal's senatorial position was protected by political immunity. ABC ran an article early in 2010 claiming that the legal process against Bernal had been stalled because of ‚Äúchicanery.‚Äù An ABC article on 24 May 2010 summed up Bernal's complex legal situation as of that date. Alegre was investigating embezzlement charges; Acu√±a was investigating the use of public-works funds to pay the Colorado Party's campaign expenses in the 2008 general election; Cazenave was investigating accusations of overcharging in the matter of Minga Guaz√∫; and Silvia Cabrera was investigating the abuse of Itaip√∫ funds via the Tes√£i Foundation. Alegre had tried to ‚Äúlaunder‚Äù Bernal by ‚Äúarchiving‚Äù charges against him, but this had been blocked by Judge Ruben Ayala Brun, with Arregui insisting on the need for further investigation. ‚ÄúIt is not easy to pursue investigations against the 'big boys,'‚Äù ABC observed, noting that Roberto Melgarejo, husband of Judge Gonzalez, who was in charge of the Minga Guaz√∫ case, is a friend of Bernal, ‚Äúand there is talk that they would be negotiating to 'launder'‚Äù him. Meanwhile, Bernal's ‚Äúrequest for immunity remains frozen in the judiciary.‚Äù It was announced in February 2011 that Bernal would not be tried for irregularly appropriating funds designated for public-service outlays in Minga Guaz√∫. District Attorney Victoria Acu√±a indicted a former CFO of Itaip√∫ and two other Itaip√∫ officials, however, for using these funds to pay campaign expenses for Bernal and others. Bernal met with Arregui and Alegre on 17 March 2011 to discuss their separate investigations of him. An ABC report noted that these meetings between Bernal and the investigators had become common. Meanwhile, Victoria Acu√±a, Eduardo Cazenave, and Humberto Otaz√∫ were investigating other charges against him. Also, Silvia Cabrera was looking into charges of embezzlement relating to the Tes√£i Foundation that had been raised by Carlos Mateo Balmelli. In reply to Balmelli's charges, Bernal called him a liar and a ‚Äúscoundrel‚Äù. It was reported on 4 September 2011 that Acu√±a had decided to officially charge Wilfrido Taboada, Rulfo Velilla Aguilera, and Guido Roque Zacar√≠as Michelagnoli with using Itaip√∫ funds to pay Colorado Party campaign expenses. She did not charge Bernal, even though he was CEO of Itaip√∫ at the time and his senatorial campaign was one of those that most benefited from the alleged diversion of funds. After an investigation of the finances of Bernal and his family that lasted from 2001 to 2011, it was reported in February 2012 that the embezzlement case against Bernal and Pleva was close to being dismissed because the prosecution's expert, Graciela Alvarez, had not found anything incriminating. In April 2012, it was reported that √Ålvarez and defense expert V√≠ctor Gonz√°lez had both rendered opinions in Bernal's favor, although some questions remained, especially in regard to Bernal's alleged front men, including Juan √Ångel Ch√°vez, Crist√≥bal Ch√°vez, F√©lix Ben√≠tez Molas, Luis Alberto L√≥pez Zayas, and √ìscar Ren√© Cabrera Rodr√≠guez, plus Luis Pereira Vigo and Fernando Jos√© Vera Vigo, the latter two being nephews of Bernal's ex- wife, Natividad Mercedes Lugo. The questions surrounded, among other things, the formation of a company called SOL 25 and the purchase of a large property in Villeta known as Potrero Guyrat√Æ for a suspiciously low price. It was reported on 30 May 2012 that Alegre would not be charging Bernal and Pleva with embezzlement, given that their reported income exceeded their reported expenditures. In June 2012, Judge Rub√©n Ayala Brun upheld Alegre's request to dismiss the case brought by Gerardo Rol√≥n Posse and Nils Candia against Bernal and his wife on charges of embezzlement. The judge noted, however, that the cases against alleged front men Ricardo Gim√©nez Ben√≠tez, Luis Pereira Vigo y Jorge Pereira Vigo, Fernando Jos√© Vera, Juan √Ångel Ch√°vez, Alberto Franco Maciel, √ìscar Cabrera Rodr√≠guez, Luis Alberto L√≥pez, and F√©lix Ben√≠tez Molas, and against Natividad Mercedes Lugo, remained ‚Äúon standby.‚Äù It was reported on 2 October 2012 that Judge Miguel Tadeo Fernandez had ordered Acu√±a to spend another year investigating the alleged use under Bernal's tenure at Itaip√∫ of public-works funds to pay campaign expenses incurred in 2008 by the Colorado Party. On 15 October 2012, it was reported that Gamba and Portillo had been officially charged with receiving a bribe from Bernal. On 16 October Acu√±a asked for a dismissal of a case against Bernal's Itaip√∫ associates Wilfrido Taboada Molinas, Rulfo Ren√© Velilla Aguilera, and Guido Roque Zacar√≠as Michelagnoli, saying that the evidence that Itaip√∫ funds had been used to pay Colorado Party campaign expenses was inconclusive. On 11 November, however, ABC stated that the evidence, to which the newspaper had access, proved that Itaip√∫ funds had been spent on the party's 2008 campaign. It was again reported on 2 November 2012 that Bernal would not be prosecuted for alleged misuse of the Minga Guaz√∫ funds. On 12 November it was reported that the Ministry of Health had not signed any agreement with Itaip√∫ to combat dengue, thereby supporting charges that more than G. 1,100 million in Itaip√∫ funds purportedly spent on an anti-dengue campaign had in fact been spent on the Colorado Party's 2008 election campaign. Later in November, Acu√±a asked Judge Tadeo Fernandez to dismiss the charges that Itaip√∫ funds had been used to pay campaign expenses. On 29 December it was reported that Tadeo Fernandez had finally dismissed the charges against Rulfo Ren√© Velilla Aguilera, Guido Guillermo Roque Zacar√≠as Michelagnoli, and Wilfrido Emigdio Taboada. Recommended for return to Itaip√∫ Senator Juan Carlos ‚ÄúCal√©‚Äù Galaverna of the Colorado Party recommended to the party's presidential candidate, Horacio Cartes, in December 2012 that if he wins the 2013 general election, he should appoint Bernal to the position of Paraguayan director of Itaip√∫.

In this work from La Tauromaquia a famous bullfighter is depicted sitting on a chair and with feet shackled together while facing the attacking bull. Here, Goya ignores - partly - the laws of perspective, depicting the viewers in a rather unusual way in order to give to more dynamism to the work. Self - portrait, 1790 - 1795, oil on canvas, 42 √ó 28 cm. In this painting Goya depicts himself in a bullfighter's suitLa Tauromaquia (Bullfighting) is a series of 33 prints created by the Spanish painter and printmaker Francisco Goya, which was published in 1816. The works of the series depict bullfighting scenes. There are also seven extra prints that were not published in the original edition. Background Spanish entertainment, 1825, lithograph, 30 √ó 41 ŒµŒ∫., Madrid, National Library. In this work from The Bulls of Bordeaux series, Goya presents bullfighting as a way of popular entertainment, and not as a violent event, as he does in Tauromaquia. Goya created Tauromaquia between 1815 and 1816, at the age of 69, during a break from his famous series The Disasters of War. The Disasters of War and the Caprichos, the series he had created previously, served as visual criticism on subjects concerning war, superstition, and contemporary Spanish society generally, including anticlerical scenes. Because of their sensitive subjects, few people had seen these works during Goya's lifetime. Bullfighting was not politically sensitive, and the series was published at the end of 1816 in an edition of 320‚Äîfor sale individually or in sets‚Äîwithout incident. It did not meet with critical or commercial success.Wilson-Bareau, 61, 64, and 67 Goya was always charmed by bullfighting, a theme that obviously inspired him, since it was the subject of many of his works: in a self-portrait (c 1790-95) he depicted himself in a bullfighter's suit; in 1793 he completed a series of eight paintings on tinplate, created for the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, which depicted scenes from bulls' lives from the moment of their birth to the time they enter the bullring; in 1825 he made the series Los toros de Burdeos (The Bulls of Bordeaux) (1825), which Delacroix purchased a copy of.Edward J. Olszewski - Exorcising Goya's \\"The Family of Charles IV\\", œÉ. 173 Indicative of his love for bulls is the fact that he signed one of his letters as Francisco de los Toros (Francisco of the Bulls).Goya, Rose-Marie & Rainer Hagen, p.10, TaschenFrancisco Goya, Evan S. Connell, p.20 The works Goya used mainly the techniques of etching and aquatint in this series. The artist focuses on the violent scenes that take place in the bullring and the daring movements of the bullfighters. The events are not presented as they are viewed by a viewer in the stands, but in a more direct way, in contrast with The Bulls of Bordeaux where the events are presented as a means of popular entertainment.Goya, Rose-Marie & Rainer Hagen, œÉ.87, 88, Taschen Works File:Goya - Modo con que los antiguos Espanoles cazaban los toros a caballo en el campo.jpgŒùŒø. 1: Modo con que los antiguos Espanoles cazaban los toros a caballo en el campo (\\"Way the ancient Spanish hunted the bulls on horse in the field\\") File:Goya - Otro modo de cazar a pie (Another Way of Hunting on Foot).jpgŒùŒø. 2: Otro modo de cazar a pie (\\"Another way of hunting on foot\\") File:Goya - Los moros ... lancean un toro en el campo.jpgŒùŒø. 3: Los moros establecidos en Espa√±a, prescindiendo de las supersticiones de su Alcor√°n, adoptaron esta caza y arte, y lancean un toro en el campo.

Early life and education Mariusz Kolodziej was born on October 3, 1966 in Rzesz√≥w, Poland, as a son of Adolf and Aleksandra. He spent his early childhood in the small town of B≈Ça≈ºowa, Poland, where he attended elementary school. His mother Aleksandra, as a director of a local high school, always emphasized the importance of good education. His father Adolf, who ran several different businesses at that time, focused on teaching his son the value of hard work. After graduating high school, Kolodziej applied to the prestigious Naval Academy in Gdynia, Poland. He was accepted in 1985, and began his four-year adventure with the Navy that included studying both in Poland and in the former Soviet Union. After leaving the Naval Academy in 1989, he decided to continue his educational experience. He moved back to Rzeszow, and started his Master‚Äôs program at the UMCS Law School. Kolodziej has been a resident of Saddle River, New Jersey. Career Hudson Bread Following his law and administration studies in his homeland Poland, he emigrated to New York City at the age of 24, and earned his starting capital in the real estate business. Having been exposed to the fine art of bread making in his father‚Äôs bakery in Poland, Kolodziej acquired the passion for and understanding of this craftsmanship at a very young age. His enthusiasm for the trade escalated each year, as did the desire to start a bakery of his own. Kolodziej was able to realize his dream in 1996 on the shore of the Hudson River in Jersey City, NJ. He analyzed the market in New York and decided in favor of a specialty European-style bakery adapted to the requirements of the American food service companies with their indulgent sandwich culture and aimed at the taste profile of New York consumers. With time, it became the sole supplier of bread to many upscale restaurants and hotels in New York City, and the entire East Coast. Hudson Bread artisan bakery, now located in North Bergen, NJ creates over 350 different kinds of bread daily.http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/15149787/article-From-baker- to-boxing-entrepreneur-North-Bergen‚Äôs-Global-Boxing-Gym-to-host-pro-boxing- series-?instance=jim_lead_story_left_column Kolodziej created many of the recipes himself, finding inspirations during his world travels.Ung, Elisa. \\"Ung: North Jersey bakery mass-produces artisanal breads\\", The Record (Bergen County), August 17, 2014.

At some point, he decided to get involved with boxing. For several years he was sponsoring one of the most famous Polish professional boxers, Tomasz Adamek. In 2010 Kolodziej became a licensed boxing promoter, and opened his own Global Boxing Gym in North Bergen, NJ. North Bergen, NJ-based Global Boxing Promotions was established in 2010. Global Boxing has developed the Polish community into one of the fastest growing fan bases in boxing in the United States. In its first year of promoting, Global Boxing set a record by selling out the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut during the \\"November Reign\\" show. On September 29, 2012 Global Boxing Promotions continued its success by filling up the arena at the Resorts Hotel & Casino for the \\"Global Boxing Series\\". Within just two years, Kolodziej led one of his fighters, Mariusz Wach, to a world title bout against Wladimir Klitschko.

It was designed and built by Robert Stevenson, grandfather of prolific writer and novelist Robert Louis Stevenson, and was first lit in 1818, making it the oldest operational lighthouse on the island. Description The lighthouse still retains its original 1st order Fresnel lens from 1890, which was supplied by Barbier, Benard, et Turenne of Paris. With a focal height or elevation of above sea level, the light from the tower has a nominal range of around . Its light characteristic is made up of a pattern of four flashes of white light every twenty seconds. The tower has a distinctive daymark of two red bands, the light can be seen clearly from across the water in south-west Scotland. Owing to the continuous accumulation of shingle and gravel deposited by the strong currents, a smaller light commonly referred to as a 'winkie' had to be built to the seaward side of the main tower in 1899. This was then repositioned a further in the same direction and for the same reasons in 1950. The 'winkie' light was discontinued on 7 April 2010. The lighthouse buildings and land have been in private ownership since 1993 when the light was fully automated. The light continues to be maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board based in Edinburgh. In August, 2005, the fog signal at the lighthouse was decommissioned owing to the assumed reliance and availability of GPS and modern shipping guidance systems.

It is about a group of adults hiking and camping, that are eventually ambushed by Bigfoot. Despite the small cast, only two actors that feature have been identified.  Plot  As shots of a forest are shown, a title card states that for the last two centuries there have been tales of a being that is half man, half beast prowling the Northwest. Some call it the Sasquatch, and others refer to it as \\"The Geek\\". As the narrator describes the Geek and similar beings that have been sighted throughout the world, three hippie couples drive up in their van and head off with camping gear, not realizing that they are being watched from a far hill by a humanoid figure. The sextet traverses the wilderness for thirty miles, eventually stopping to set up camp, as the narrators informs the viewer that the couples are in search of indisputable evidence of the existence of the Geek. While the others work, newlyweds John and Valerie go off alone to have sex, later returning to the campsite, where it is agreed that the group will go further east, into uncharted territory. In their tent, two of the campers have sex, and afterward the man admits that he was a virgin, his only prior sexual experience being when his sister allowed him to fondle her breasts. The next day, the group discovers a large footprint, and stake out a nearby ridge. The Geek appears, and rapes one of the women when she approaches it. The beast then goes after Valerie, and rapes her as well. The men attack the Geek, but it fights them off, and escapes.

At the time, he was superintendent of the Boston Lunatic Asylum, now the Boston State Hospital. Charles Harrison Stedman, M.D. Biography Stedman was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts. He attended Yale University but did not graduate. Later, Yale awarded him an honorary master's degree. He attended the Harvard Medical School earning his medical degree in 1828. For the following ten years, he was a resident surgeon at the Chelsea Naval Hospital. In 1840, he began his surgical practice in Boston. His surgical experience may have led to his interest in neuroanatomy. In 1834, he revised Johann Spurzheim‚Äôs book, Anatomy of the Brain. Stedman noted in the book‚Äôs Preface that he revised the American edition since he believed the London translation from the original French was hurried, contained some ambiguity, and had typographical errors. In 1839, the Boston Lunatic Asylum was opened, the first municipal asylum in the country. Dr. John Butler was its first superintendent. Butler left in 1842 to go to the Hartford Retreat. The superintendent position at Boston was offered to and accepted by Stedman. Stedman left the Boston Lunatic Asylum in 1851 to return to his surgical practice. He served as a visiting then senior surgeon at the Boston City Hospital when it opened in 1864. He served as the first medical coroner in Massachusetts. He died in 1866. Works Spurzheim, J.

It provides an independent research institute for the mathematical sciences in North America, a counterpart to the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in Europe. The research station, commonly known by its acronym, \\"BIRS\\", hosts over 2000 international scientists each year to undertake research collaboration in the mathematical sciences.  Research activities  The research that takes place at the Banff International Research Station is either in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, or in other areas of science where they intersect with mathematics. There is a wide range of research publications citing lectures, meetings and reports from BIRS.  Research program  The Banff International Research Station hosts five types of meetings: # 5-Day Workshops: These make up the core program at BIRS, with up to 42 participants per workshop, 48 weeks per year. Some workshops have only 21 participants, and they share a week at BIRS, running concurrently. # 2-Day Workshops: Weekend workshops, typically consisting of 25 people, and typically from the surrounding areas in Alberta and British Columbia. # Focused Research Groups: Up to 8 people from different institutions meet for 1‚Äì2 weeks, to work on a specific problem or finish up major projects. # Research in Teams: 2‚Äì4 people from different institutions meet for 1‚Äì2 weeks to concentrate on their research. # Summer Schools and Training Camps: instructional meetings for up to 40 students for up to 14 days. The core program of 5-day workshops is created two years in advance. Every summer, BIRS issues a Call for Proposals, soliciting applications for workshops from the global scientific community. Each year, it gets more competitive to get a space in the 48 available weeks at BIRS: 79 proposals were received for the 2003 program, and 168 were received for the 2014 program. An extensive peer-review process by international experts culminates in the selection of the scientific program for a given year. Summer schools and training camps must apply through the same process as 5-day workshops. An example of a summer school is the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) training camp, to prepare high school students for competing at the IMO. The other types of meetings are far less competitive, and may be applied for at any time, through the BIRS website.  Meeting facilities  The Banff International Research Station occupies two buildings on the campus of the Banff Centre, in Banff National Park. One of the buildings, Corbett Hall, is a residence building that provides bedrooms, a common lounge area, a small library, and space for small teams of people to work. The other building, TransCanada PipeLines Pavilion, hosts administrative offices, two lecture rooms, and a series of smaller rooms for break-out sessions and research teams. As part of the Banff Centre campus, BIRS researchers have full access to all of its amenities and services. The idea behind this choice of location for a research facility is to create an atmosphere where scientists can remove themselves from day-to-day life, and immerse themselves in their research.  Automated lecture capture  In 2012, the Banff International Research Station installed a fully automated lecture capture system. It provides live video streaming and video recording of the lectures that take place in its main lecture room. Video recordings are automatically posted on the BIRS website within a few minutes after a lecture ends. Use of the system is opt-in, decided by the individual lecturers at the time of their lecture, via a touchscreen panel in the lecture room. The automated system at BIRS employs high quality cameras to ensure that mathematics written on chalkboards can be seen clearly. Embedded microphones and audio processing systems capture both the lecturer and questions from the audience. Recent research videos recorded at BIRS are also available in the iTunes podcast directory.  Funding  The Banff International Research Station is funded by four governments: # The federal government of Canada, through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) # The provincial government of Alberta, through Alberta Science and Research Authority (ASRA) # The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) # Mexico's National Science and Technology Council, (CONACYT)  See also  * BIRS Director, Nassif Ghoussoub * The Banff Centre * Banff, Alberta * Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences * Mathematical Sciences Research Institute * Comments from BIRS researchers  References  Category:Research stations Category:Mathematical institutes Category:Research institutes in Canada Category:International research institutes Category:Buildings and structures in Banff, Alberta Category:Research institutes established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Alberta ","title":"Banff International Research Station"},{"id":"39151824","text":"The R520 is a Regional Route in South Africa.

In 1835, he introduced the operation of periosteum to treat splints and sprain in horses. He was considered an expert in lameness in horses. In 1829, he performed the first operation for bladder stones in horses. Sewell gradually stopped teaching, and became the director of the London Veterinary School, its Secretary, and its Resident governor.

On April 18, 2013 it was announced that the star has two planets. Although initial estimates indicated that the terrestrial planet Kepler-69c might be within the star's habitable zone, further analysis showed that the planet very likely is interior to the habitable zone and is far more analogous to Venus than to Earth and thus completely inhospitable. Nomenclature and history Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-69 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19330262+4452080. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 8692861, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-172. Kepler Space Telescope search volume, in the context of the Milky Way. The star's planets were discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. The name Kepler-69 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 69th star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets. The designations b, c derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet. In the case of Kepler-69, all of the known planets in the system were discovered at one time, so b is applied to the closest planet to the star and c to the farthest. Stellar characteristics Kepler-69 is a G-type star that is approximately 81% the mass of and 93% the radius of the Sun. It has a surface temperature of 5638 ¬± 168 K. In comparison, the Sun has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.7. Therefore, Kepler-69 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Planetary system Kepler-69 has two known planets orbiting around it. Kepler-69b is a hot super-Earth-sized exoplanet. Kepler-69c is a super-Earth- sized exoplanet, about 70% larger than Earth. It receives a similar amount of flux from its star as Venus does from the Sun, and is thus a likely candidate for a super-Venus.

He personally knew the thirteen founders of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions of the Insane (AMSAII), now the American Psychiatric Association. He served as secretary- treasurer of the Association for 34 years (1856‚Äì1890). Curwen was born at his father‚Äôs estate in Montgomery County near Philadelphia. He graduated from Yale University in 1841 and received his medical degree in 1844 from The University of Pennsylvania. He spent several months at the Wills Eye Hospital and then moved to the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane where he remained for six years as Assistant Physician to Dr. Thomas Kirkbride. Kirkbride was acknowledged as a leader in AMSAII and with the administration of asylums. He designed plans for the construction of mental hospitals which were adopted throughout the United States in the second half of the nineteenth century. Curwen was influenced by Kirkbride‚Äôs mentorship throughout his professional life. After a memorial to the Pennsylvania Legislature by Dorothea Dix in 1844, money was appropriated to build the State Hospital for the Insane in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In 1851, Curwen became superintendent and remained in the post until 1881 when he moved to Warren, Pennsylvania to open an asylum. He stayed there until 1900. His tenure of 57 years in asylums remains unparalleled. As superintendent, Curwen introduced the method of moral treatment for patients. This method fostered pleasant surroundings with minimal use of restraints, occupation and recreation therapies, and medication only as needed. In 1851, he published A Manual for Attendants in Hospitals for the Insane which he set forth the directions for the treatment of patients plus descriptions of various types of hydrotherapy and special diets. The manual is still applicable today. Curwen actively participated in medical associations including county and state medical societies, and on occasions, he represented the AMSAII at annual meetings of the American Medical Association. He was a member of the American Philosophical Association, the British Medico-Psychological Association, and a trustee of Lafayette College. He was among the first to employ women physicians when he hired Dr. Margaret Cleaves in 1879 to be in charge of the women‚Äôs division of the State Hospital for the Insane. She resigned in 1883 and Curwen hired her assistant, Dr. Jane Garver, who remained until 1900. As secretary of the AMSAII, Curwen attended the annual meetings, participated in discussions and presented papers. He maintained the Association‚Äôs archives and the Proceedings of each annual meeting was summarized and published in the American Journal of Insanity. His book, History of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane from 1844 to 1874 summarizes each annual meeting and appendixes of the venues of annual meetings, the officers of the Association, and state asylums.

The grape is distinct from Merlot gris which is a pink-skinned color mutation of the red wine grape Merlot and is sometimes used in vin gris and ros√© wines. Plantings of Merlot blanc were first discovered in 1891 but cuttings of the vine have not been widely propagated and the variety is very rare. It is not used to make the sweet White Zinfandel-style wine White Merlot that is made by some California wine producers. Those wines are made from a saignee of red Merlot wine. Relationship to other grapes Folle blanche, one of the parent varieties of Merlot blanc. When Merlot blanc was first discovered, it was thought that the vine was a white-berried color mutation of Merlot in a similar relation to how Grenache blanc is a color mutation of Grenache and Pinot blanc is a mutation of Pinot noir. However, DNA analysis conducted by the University of California-Davis and noted ampelographers such as Carole Meredith confirmed that Merlot blanc was distinct from Merlot (itself the result of a crossing of the Bordeaux grape Cabernet Franc and the Brittany/Charente grape Magdeleine Noire des Charentes) but rather was an offspring of Merlot. Inheritance analysis of 55 genetic markers spread out over 9 chromosomes, showed that Merlot blanc was the result of a crossing of Merlot with the Cognac/Armagnac grape Folle blanche. Instead of being a white- berried color mutation, Merlot blanc is actually an offspring of Merlot (pictured). Wine regions Even though plantings of Merlot blanc are scarce, the grape is still a permitted a variety in the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wines of several Bordeaux wine regions including the general AOC Bordeaux (but not for wines labeled Bordeaux Sup√©rieur). Here Merlot blanc can be used in up to 30% of the blend along with Semillon (which must make up at least 70% of the blend itself), Sauvignon blanc, Muscadelle, Colombard, Mauzac, Ondenc and Ugni blanc. Merlot blanc destined for AOC wine production are limited to harvest yields no greater than 55 hl/ha (approximately 3.7 tons/acre with the finished wines needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. Other Bordeaux AOCs that permit the usage of Merlot blanc in their designated white wines include Bordeaux-Haut-Benauge (maximum harvest yield of 50 hl/ha), C√¥tes de Bourg (but not the C√¥tes de Blaye) and Entre- Deux-Mers (which like the C√¥tes de Bourg limits harvest yield to 60 hl/ha).

The Madagascar free-tailed bat is endemic to northern, western, and southern Madagascar. The Madagascar free- tailed bat is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List due to its widespread distribution in Madagascar. Threats to it are unclear and more research is needed into the possible disturbance of its roost sites. The species roosts in one cave that is considered to be fady, or taboo, and it has been recorded in five protected areas: Parc National du Tsingy de Bemaraha, Parc National de Namoroka, Parc National d‚ÄôIsalo, R√©serve Sp√©ciale d‚ÄôAnkarana and R√©serve Sp√©ciale d‚ÄôAnalamerana. There are nine currently known roosting colonies, and all are in areas that receive some sort of protection by Madagascar. The population of the Madagascar free-tailed bat is unknown. The Madagascar free-tailed bat is supposed to be an obligate cave dweller and roosts in areas with sandstone and limestone outcrops. The caves where the species lived in R√©serve Sp√©ciale d‚ÄôAnkarana were all associated with cool temperatures, high elevation, and a close proximity to water.

In 2010, these were completely excavated by Sertich and Liva Ratsimbaholison. The fossils were then transported to the United States of America to be prepared, repaired and scanned in the Stony Brook University. After casts had been made and stored in the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology with inventory number RAM 16010, the original fossils were returned to Madagascar and added to the collection of the University of Antananarivo. The type species Dahalokely tokana was named by Farke and Sertich in 2013. The generic name Dahalokely means \\"small thief\\" in Malagasy, deriving from its estimated length of smaller than those of known abelisaurids. The specific name tokana means \\"lonely\\" in the same language in reference to the isolation of the Madagascan subcontinent. During the Turonian, Madagascar and India were part of the same landmass that had separated from the rest of Gondwana. Dahalokely is the only dinosaur known from Madagascar when the island was separate from Gondwana but still connected with India, forming Indo-Madagascar. In the ZooBank the genus has the Life Science Identifier 8147803A-D4BE-4BA9-9701-D853E 37DE411 and the species the LSID AFAE32BB-123A-45D4-B931-4FF2A ABAF41C. The holotype, UA 9855, was uncovered in what is informally named the Ambolafotsy Formation, a Turonian- age deposit of the Diego Basin in northern Madagascar, about 93 million years old.Dahalokely at Fossilworks.org It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull, of a subadult individual, preserving vertebrae and ribs. These include the fifth neck vertebra, the first, second, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth dorsal vertebrae, the left dorsal rib, the upper parts of two right ribs, the lower ends of two ribs and some rib fragments. The identification of the position of these elements is tentative. They were not found in articulation but were assumed to represent the same individual as they were discovered not a metre apart.  Description  Life restoration Initial size estimates of Dahalokely, at , were based on the assumption it was built like an abelisaurid. Should it have had the more elongated build of the noasaurids, it would have been long. It was estimated as being in length in 2016. The describing authors established several unique derived traits, autapomorphies. The cervical vertebra has a lamina, bone sheet, between the front joint process, the prezygapophysis, and a rear process, the epipophysis, the edge of which lamina is markedly convex, the convex part being longer than the vertebral body and separated from both the prezygapophysis and the epipophysis by conspicuous notches. With the first and second dorsal vertebrae, the prezygapophysis and the lamina between it and the vertebral body are arranged on a vertical line, the joint facet of the prezygapophysis and the front vertebral body face being positioned in the same plane. With the second dorsal vertebra, the joint facets of the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses, are strongly concave. From at least the sixth dorsal vertebra onwards, the fossa or hollowed out area, below the prezygapophysis is divided into two smaller depressions.  Classification  In 2013 Dahalokely was assigned to the Abelisauroidea. The phylogenetic position of Dahalokely among abelisauroids is uncertain. Its vertebrae and ribs have features of both main groups of abelisauroids, the Noasauridae and the Abelisauridae. A phylogenetic analysis published along with its first description found Dahalokely to be a basal noasaurid, but this result was only weakly supported. The incompleteness of the remains and the lack of material that overlaps with known skeletal elements of other abelisauroid species means that the relationships of Dahalokely within the Abelisauroidea are hard to determine.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1837 until April 1839 he ran ten times and won nine races, although three of his victories were walkovers when no rival appeared to oppose him. He was one of the leading British two-year-olds of 1837, when his three wins included the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. In the following year he returned to Doncaster where he recorded an emphatic win in the St Leger and then defeated a strong field of older horses in the Doncaster Cup. In the following year he was campaigned at Newmarket where he was beaten for the first time by Grey Momus in the Port Stakes. After one more win he suffered serious leg injuries which ended his racing career. He was retired to stud where he became a successful breeding stallion. Background Don John was a bay horse standing 15 hands three inches high with a white sock on his left hind leg. He was bred by Mr Garforth and sold as a foal for 140 guineas to Robert Ridsdale and at Ridsdale's dispersal sale in 1836, the yearling was bought by George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield. Lord Chesterfield, however, was listed as the colt's breeder in the General Stud Book, and the exact relationship between Chesterfield's racing interests and those of the Ridsdale brothers was somewhat unclear. Lord Chesterfield sent Don John into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners at his base at Whitewall stables, Malton, North Yorkshire. The colt was ridden in most of his important races by the trainer's younger brother, Bill Scott. He was the ninth of thirteen foals produced by Mr Garforth's unnamed Comus mare, whose other progeny included the Northumberland Plate winner Hetman Platoff. He was probably sired by Waverley, although the Comus mare had previously been covered by the stallion Tramp in the year of his conception. Waverley won several major races in Yorkshire including Gold Cups at Newcastle and Pontefract. Apart from Don John, the best of his offspring was The Saddler, a colt that won the Doncaster Cup and was beaten a short-head by Chorister when favourite for the 1831 St Leger. Racing career 1837: two-year-old season Until 1913, there was no requirement for British racehorses to have official names, and the horse who later became known as Don John began his racing career as Lord Chesterfield's b. c. by Tramp, or Waverley, out of Sharpset's dam. The colt made his first appearance in The Two yrs old Stakes at York Racecourse on 31 May 1837. He started the 5/2 third favourite in a field of six and won from the Duke of Cleveland's colt Alzira. The colt did not race again until the St Leger meeting at Doncaster in autumn. On 18 September, he started favourite at odds of 6/4 for the Champagne Stakes over the second half of the St Leger course. The still unnamed colt took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths from five opponents, winning a prize of 750 sovereigns. As part of the race's conditions, Lord Chesterfield was obliged to present six dozen bottles of champagne to the Doncaster Racing Club. Eleven days later, the now officially named Don John appeared at the Heaton Park Racecourse in Manchester. Ridden by Nat Flatman, he won the local Claret Stakes, beating George Osbaldeston's The Fairy Queen over six furlongs. 1838: three-year-old season The Earl of Chesterfield, who owned Don John during his racing career On his three-year-old debut, Don John was sent from Yorkshire to Newmarket for a one-mile sweepstakes at the Craven meeting in April. The trip proved lucrative but uninformative as the colt was allowed to walkover for the 700 sovereign prize when his three rivals were withdrawn by their owners. Don John had never been entered in The Derby and was off the course for five months before returning at Doncaster in September. A field of seven runners, the smallest for thirty-six years, assembled for the Great St Leger Stakes and Don John was made 13/8 favourite ahead of the Derby runner-up Ion. Ridden as usual by Bill Scott, Don John took the lead shortly after the start, quickly took a three length advantage and set a \\"killing\\" pace. His rivals were effectively beaten by half way and the favourite won by at least five lengths from Ion, who was in turn six lengths clear of Lanercost in third. The New Sporting Magazine commented that \\"never was a St. Leger won so easy or so gallantly before\\". His victory was enthusiastically received the large crowd, and became even more popular when Lord Chesterfield held \\"open house\\" at the nearby Salutation Inn, providing free food and drink to anyone who joined the celebration. Two days later the St Leger winner was matched against older horse in the four-mile Gold Cup, a race in which he was partnered by Flatman as Scott was unable to ride at the specified weight of seven stones. His meeting with the outstanding racemare Bee's-wing created much interest, although there was some disappointment that the leading Irish horse Harkaway failed to appear. Don John tracked Bee's-wing until the final furlong when he took the lead, quickly went clear and won easily from the mare, with The Doctor third and Melbourne last of the four runners. Later the same afternoon, Don John walked over for the Gascoigne Stakes over the St Leger course and distance. Don John again ended his season at Heaton Park in late September where he walked over for the local version of the \\"St Leger Stakes\\". During this period, many racecourse, including York and Newmarket named races after the Doncaster classic, leading the original to use the prefix \\"Great\\" to distinguish it from its imitators. 1839: four-year- old season Don John was undefeated in eight races when he appeared at Newmarket for the Port Stakes over two miles on 5 April 1839. He started 2/5 favourite for the race but was beaten by Lord George Bentinck's colt Grey Momus winner of the previous seasons 2000 Guineas and Ascot Gold Cup. At Newmarket's First Spring meeting later that month Don John was ridden by Harry Edwards to win an 1,800 sovereign sweepstakes from three opponents over the four-mile Beacon Course. Shortly after this contest the colt's legs \\"gave way\\" and he never raced again, being retired to stud at the end of the year. Stud record Don John began his career as a breeding stallion at Tickhill Castle Farm in Yorkshire at fee of fifteen guineas with a \\"guinea to the groom\\". By 1843 he was standing at the same fee at Bretby Park, Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, where he remained for several years, with the price of his services increasing to 20 guineas a mare by 1848. He later moved to George Tattersall's stud at Willesden Paddocks, Kilburn, where he was standing at fifteen guineas in 1853. Don John was sold to Dr. A.B.T. Merritt and exported to Richmond, Virginia in June 1855. In November 1855, Don John won second prize at the Virginia State Fair in the Thoroughbred stallion category, losing to Red Eye by Boston. Don John died in 1857. Don John's only classic winner was Lady Evelyn, the winner of the Oaks Stakes in 1849, but he sired many other good winners including Mrs Taft (Cesarewitch) and The Ban (St James's Palace Stakes). His most influential son was Iago, who sired Bonnie Scotland, twice leading sire in North America. A more important long-term influence on the Thoroughbred was Don John's daughter Maid of Masham, a top-class racemare who became an outstanding broodmare. As the founder of Family 9-e she was the direct female-line ancestor of numerous major winners throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: her descendants include Cyllene, Friar Rock, Corrida, Galcador, Haafhd, Snow Chief, High-Rise, Zafonic, Daylami, Dalakhani and Dubawi.

He started a radio servicing business in Kingston, and imported jazz records from the US. He began making amplifiers in the late 1940s, and played jazz and Cuban records through them at his record store, Bop City. Jones built powerful amplifiers, with the technologically advanced capacity to distinguish and enhance treble, mid-range and bass frequencies.

In 1963, Dodd commissioned Jones to build the equipment for his Studio One recording studios in Kingston. Jones was described as \\"probably Jamaica's most important pioneer of sound system electronics\\".Michael Veal, Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae, Wesleyan University Press, 2007, p. 275. With his cousin Stephen, Jones also built and demonstrated Jamaica's first traffic lights in 1952, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Charlie. Between 1959 and 1964 he was an instructor at Kingston Technical High School. He also achieved eminence as an astronomer, grinding his own lenses and building several telescopes, and received a Certificate of Merit from the Jamaica Cultural Development Commission in 1987 for his work in astronomy. Jones moved to Montego Bay in 1965 to work as a bandleader in tourist resorts. He became an active member of the local musicians' union, which eventually led in 1985 to him becoming president, for ten years, of the Jamaica Federation of Musicians, receiving awards for meritorious service on his retirement.

C. Davidson, \\"Physics of Non-neutral Plasmas\\", (Addison-Wesley, Redwood City, CA, 1990) The simplest non-neutral plasmas are plasmas consisting of a single charge species. Examples of single species non-neutral plasmas that have been created in laboratory experiments are plasmas consisting entirely of electrons, pure ion plasmas, positron plasmas, and antiproton plasmas. Non-neutral plasmas are used for research into basic plasma phenomena such as cross-magnetic field transport,F. Anderegg, \\"Internal Transport in Non-Neutral Plasmas,\\" presented at Winter School on Physics with Trapped Charged Particles; to appear, Imperial College Press (2013) http://nnp.ucsd.edu/pdf_files/Anderegg_transport_leshouches_2012.pdf nonlinear vortex interactions, and plasma waves and instabilities. They have also been used to create cold neutral antimatter, by carefully mixing and recombining cryogenic pure positron and pure antiproton plasmas. Positron plasmas are also used in atomic physics experiments that study the interaction of antimatter with neutral atoms and molecules. Cryogenic pure ion plasmas have been used in studies of strongly coupled plasmas and quantum entanglement. More prosaically, pure electron plasmas are used to produce the microwaves in microwave ovens, via the magnetron instability. Neutral plasmas in contact with a solid surface (that is, most laboratory plasmas) are typically non- neutral in their edge regions. Due to unequal loss rates to the surface for electrons and ions, an electric field (the \\"ambipolar field\\" ) builds up, acting to hold back the more mobile species until the loss rates are the same. The electrostatic potential (as measured in electron-volts) required to produce this electric field depends on many variables but is often on the order of the electron temperature. Non-neutral plasmas for which all species have the same sign of charge have exceptional confinement properties compared to neutral plasmas. They can be confined in a thermal equilibrium state using only static electric and magnetic fields, in a Penning trap configuration (see Fig. 1). Confinement times of up to several hours have been achieved.J. H. Malmberg et al., \\"The Cryogenic Pure Electron Plasma\\", Proceedings of the 1984 Sendai Symposium on Plasma Nonlinear Phenomena\\" http://nnp.ucsd.edu/pdf_files/Proc_84_Sendai_1X.pdf Using the \\"rotating wall\\" method, the plasma confinement time can be increased arbitrarily. Such non- neutral plasmas can also access novel states of matter. For instance, they can be cooled to cryogenic temperatures without recombination (since there is no oppositely charged species with which to recombine). If the temperature is sufficiently low (typically on the order of 10 mK), the plasma can become a non-neutral liquid or a crystal. The body-centered-cubic structure of these plasma crystals has been observed by Bragg scattering in experiments on laser- cooled pure beryllium plasmas. Fig. 1. Diagram of a non-neutral plasma confined in a Penning trap. Equilibrium of a single species non-neutral plasma  Non-neutral plasmas with a single sign of charge can be confined for long periods of time using only static electric and magnetic fields. One such configuration is called a Penning trap, after the inventor F. M. Penning. The cylindrical version of the trap is also sometimes referred to as a Penning- Malmberg trap, after Prof. John Malmberg. The trap consists of several cylindrically symmetric electrodes and a uniform magnetic field applied along the axis of the trap (Fig 1). Plasmas are confined in the axial direction by biasing the end electrodes so as to create an axial potential well that will trap charges of a given sign (the sign is assumed to be positive in the figure). In the radial direction, confinement is provided by the Lorentz force due to rotation of the plasma about the trap axis. Plasma rotation causes an inward directed Lorentz force that just balances the outward directed forces caused by the unneutralized plasma as well as the centrifugal force. Mathematically, radial force balance implies a balance between electric, magnetic and centrifugal forces: where particles are assumed to have mass m and charge q, r is radial distance from the trap axis and Er is the radial component of the electric field. This quadratic equation can be solved for the rotational velocity v_\\\\theta, leading to two solutions, a slow-rotation and a fast-rotation solution. The rate of rotation \\\\omega = -v_\\\\theta/r for these two solutions can be written as : \\\\omega = \\\\frac{\\\\Omega_c}{2} \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{{\\\\Omega_c}^2/4-q E_r/{m r}} , where \\\\Omega_c = q B/m is the cyclotron frequency. Depending on the radial electric field, the solutions for the rotation rate fall in the range 0 \\\\le \\\\omega/\\\\Omega_c \\\\le 1 . The slow and fast rotation modes meet when the electric field is such that q E_r/{m r} = {\\\\Omega_c}^2/4 . This is called the Brillouin limit; it is an equation for the maximum possible radial electric field that allows plasma confinement. This radial electric field can be related to the plasma density n through the Poisson equation, : \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}(r E_r)= qn/\\\\epsilon_0 , and this equation can be used to obtain a relation between the density and the plasma rotation rate. If we assume that the rotation rate is uniform in radius (i.e. the plasma rotates as a rigid body), then Eq. (1) implies that the radial electric field is proportional to radius r. Solving for Er from this equation in terms of \\\\omega and substituting the result into Poisson's equation yields This equation implies that the maximum possible density occurs at the Brillouin limit, and has the value : n_B= \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0 m {\\\\Omega_c}^2}{2 q^2}=\\\\frac{B^2/(2 \\\\mu_0)}{m c^2} where c=1/\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0} is the speed of light. Thus, the rest energy density of the plasma, n¬∑m¬∑c2, is less than or equal to the magnetic energy density B^2/(2\\\\mu_0) of the magnetic field. This is a fairly stringent requirement on the density. For a magnetic field of 10 tesla, the Brillouin density for electrons is only nB = . The density predicted by Eq.(2), scaled by the Brillouin density, is shown as a function of rotation rate in Fig. (2). Two rotation rates yield the same density, corresponding to the slow and fast rotation solutions. Fig. 2. Density versus rotation rate for a single species plasma confined in a Penning trap.  Plasma loss processes; the rotating wall method  In experiments on single species plasmas, plasma rotation rates in the tens of kHz range are not uncommon, even in the slow rotation mode. This rapid rotation is necessary to provide the confining radial Lorentz force for the plasma. However, if there is neutral gas in the trap, collisions between the plasma and the gas cause the plasma rotation to slow, leading to radial expansion of the plasma until it comes in contact with the surrounding electrodes and is lost. This loss process can be alleviated by operating the trap in an ultra high vacuum. However, even under such conditions the plasma rotation can still be slowed through the interaction of the plasma with \\"errors\\" in the external confinement fields. If these fields are not perfectly cylindrically symmetric, the asymmetries can torque on the plasma, reducing the rotation rate. Such field errors are unavoidable in any actual experiment, and limit the plasma confinement time. It is possible to overcome this plasma loss mechanism by applying a rotating field error to the plasma. If the error rotates faster than the plasma, it acts to spin up the plasma (similar to how the spinning blade of a blender causes the food to spin), counteracting the effect of field errors that are stationary in the frame of the laboratory. This rotating field error is referred to as a \\"rotating wall\\", after the theory idea that one could reverse the effect of a trap asymmetry by simply rotating the entire trap at the plasma rotation frequency. Since this is impractical, one instead rotates the trap electric field rather than the entire trap, by applying suitably phased voltages to a set of electrodes surrounding the plasma. Cryogenic non-neutral plasmas: correlated states  When a non-neutral plasma is cooled to cryogenic temperatures, it does not recombine to a neutral gas as would a neutral plasma, because there are no oppositely charged particles with which to recombine. As a result, the system can access novel strongly coupled non-neutral states of matter, including plasma crystals consisting solely of a single charge species. These strongly coupled non-neutral plasmas are parametrized by the coupling parameter Œì, defined as :\\\\Gamma = \\\\frac{q^2}{4 \\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0 k_B T a}, where T is the temperature and a is the Wigner-Seitz radius (or mean inter-particle spacing), given in terms of the density n by the expression 4\\\\pi a^3 n/3 =1. The coupling parameter can be thought of as the ratio of the mean interaction energy between nearest-neighbor pairs, q^2/(4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0 a), and the mean kinetic energy of order k_b T. When this ratio is small, interactions are weak and the plasma is nearly an ideal gas of charges moving in the mean-field produced by the other charges. However, when \\\\Gamma > 1 interactions between particles are important and the plasma behaves more like a liquid, or even a crystal if \\\\Gamma is sufficiently large. In fact, computer simulations and theory have predicted that for an infinite homogeneous plasma the system exhibits a gradual onset of short-range order consistent with a liquid-like state for \\\\Gamma \\\\approx 2 , and there is predicted to be a first-order phase transition to a body-centered-cubic crystal for \\\\Gamma\\\\simeq 175. Experiments have observed this crystalline state in a pure beryllium ion plasma that was laser-cooled to the millikelvin temperature range. The mean inter-particle spacing in this pure ion crystal was on the order of 10-20 ¬µm, much larger than in neutral crystalline matter. This spacing corresponds to a density on the order of 108-109 cm‚àí3, somewhat less than the Brillouin limit for beryllium in the 4.5 tesla magnetic field of the experiment. Cryogenic temperatures were then required in order to obtain a \\\\Gamma value in the strongly coupled regime. The experiments measured the crystal structure by the Bragg-scattering technique, wherein a collimated laser beam was scattered off of the crystal, displaying Bragg peaks at the expected scattering angles for a bcc lattice (See Fig. 3). When small numbers of ions are laser-cooled, they form crystalline \\"Coulomb clusters\\". The symmetry of the cluster depends on the form of the external confinement fields. An interactive 3D view of some of the clusters can be found here. Fig. 3. False color image of UV laser light that has undergone Bragg scattering by a pure ion crystal.

Cruz was the first Mexican-American legislator to be elected in Harris County since Lorenzo De Zavala in 1836. A Democrat who served three terms, Cruz focused on the areas of minimum wage, rights for farm workers, and migrant worker housing and transportation.  Early life  Born in Beaumont to Manuel Cruz and Margarita Menchaca, Lauro Cruz moved to Houston, Texas with his family when he was six months old, where his father owned and operated a grocery store. He enlisted for the United States Marine Corps Reserve during the Korean War in his second year of high school, and completed his GED in the Marines before being honorably discharged. Upon returning to Houston, he applied to be a bus driver with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County and became their first Mexican-American driver. Later, he decided he wanted to attend college, explaining \\"I‚Ä¶wanted to go to college and the problem was I didn't know how to enroll. So, I just went over to the University of Houston and I said how do I get in here, you know? Somebody said you go to the admissions office and I said OK. Anyway, I ended up there.\\" He received a BA in Political Science from the University of Houston.  Political career  As a State Representative, Cruz worked primarily in the areas of minimum wage and rights for farm workers and migrant workers. His interest in the topics developed after he was approached by activists organizing a march on Austin for farm workers' rights in 1966. As a young legislator without much bargaining power, Cruz explained his method for gaining support: \\"...I would approach him every day and I'd say, 'John,' I said, 'are you going to vote for minimum wage?' Kept asking until the other legislator needed something in return.\\" After three terms in the legislature, Cruz began to run out of savings from his grocery business before he was a legislator. Sensing that it was time to \\"move up or move out,\\" Cruz ran unsuccessfully for State Treasurer in 1972 to Jesse James. Cruz explained, \\"...how can I beat a guy with a name like Jesse James?\\" Maybe I ought to change my name to Pancho Villa, you know.\\"  Post-legislative career  After leaving the legislature, Cruz became involved with the Dolph Briscoe gubernatorial campaign. After Governor Briscoe's election, he became the only Mexican-American special assistant to the Governor. Cruz used his position to push for fairer hiring practices for Mexican-Americans, asking state agencies for records of every Hispanic employed by the agency and their position. Later, he was asked by the governor to head the Greater South Texas Cultural Basin Commission, aimed at bringing economic development to South Texas. After leaving the Governor's staff, Cruz became the head of the Texas Good Neighbor Commission. Wanting to stay close to his friends and family in Texas, Cruz opted to pursue work as a lobbyist and became one of the first Hispanic independent lobbyists in Texas. In 1988, Cruz approached the Dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and proposed a leadership training program geared toward Mexican Americans called the Innovations88 Leadership Program, aimed at \\"...trying to get people more information on public policy, give them some skills in the area of parliamentary procedure, more than just a motion and a second.\\"  References   External links  *House Member Information Page *Lauro Cruz's Birthday House Resolution *Oral History Interview with Lauro Cruz Category:1933 births Category:2017 deaths Category:University of Houston alumni Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Democrats Category:People from Beaumont, Texas ","title":"Lauro Cruz"},{"id":"39152347","title":"Dutch Twenty20 Cup"},{"id":"39152353","text":"Dessaline Harris (1 October 1895 - 29 March 1966) was a Liberian jurist and a member of the Supreme Court of Liberia.

She founded La Liga de las Hijas de Cuba, one of the first all-women‚Äôs organizations dedicated to the Antillean emancipation struggle.Vega, Bernardo. Memoirs of Bernardo Vega: A Contribution to the history of the Puerto Rican community. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1984. Early life and career Emilia Casanova de Villaverde was born into an elite Creole slaveholding family in Cuba in 1832.Ruiz, Vicki and Virginia Sanchez. Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006. Despite her affluent Creole upbringing, de Villaverde did not share her father's conservative views. At a banquet during her youth, with Spanish authorities in attendance, she defiantly made a toast to Cuban freedom from Spanish colonial power. By 1825, most of Spain's colonies in the Americas gained independence except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, which remained under Spanish rule.Ferrer, Ada. Insurgent Cuba: Race, Nation, and Revolution, 1868‚Äì1898. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999. Cuban elites believed that Spanish colonialism would help maintain Cuba's domination of the sugar industry and prevent a slave uprising similar to the Haitian Revolution in 1791. Over the years, many inhabitants of Cuba and Puerto Rico grew dissatisfied with Spanish control, intensifying with the Ten Years' War (1868‚Äì1878), the first major rebellion challenging Spanish authority. Emilia Casanova de Villaverde first traveled to the United States in 1852, along with her father and two brothers. This trip gave her exposure to the Cuban exile community in New York and further sparked her interest in the Cuban independence movement. Although de Villaverde considered remaining in New York City to continue her education, she returned to Cuba after only three months to care for her mother back at home. On her return journey, she agreed to transport revolutionary documents on behalf of the exile community and distributed them in Cuba. At the age of twenty-two, the Casanova family moved to Philadelphia, where Emilia met and soon after married Cirilo Villaverde. Cirilo Villaverde was a Cuban poet and novelist, most notable for writing the novel Cecilia Valdes. This novel exposed the complex nature of race and class relations embedded in Cuban society.Hollingsworth, C. \\"Cirilo Villaverde and Realism: The Theme of Slavery in Cecilia Valdes.\\" Caribbean Studies 15 (1976): 29‚Äì42. Cirilo had been a politically active member of the Cuban exile community since his arrival in the United States in the 1840s.Poyo, Gerald. \\"Evolution of Cuban Separatist Thought in the √âmigr√© Communities of the United States, 1848‚Äì1895.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 66 (1986):485‚Äì507. Like many separatists during the 1840s and 1850s, he initially believed that annexation to the United States was the only way Cuba could eventually abolish slavery. As his viewpoints evolved over time; however, Cirilo eventually favored true Cuban liberation. After marrying the couple moved to New York City, where they became actively involved in the Cuban exile community's independence movement. Early political activity As Emilia Casanova de Villaverde built up a social network within the Cuban exile community in New York, she started organizing public meetings, writing articles dedicated to the independence cause, and hosting gatherings at her home for supporters of the Cuban revolution. However, women were generally denied membership into political clubs during this time. In response to this barrier, Emilia created all-women‚Äôs clubs to increase her prominence and decision-making power among exile nationalists. Prior to founding the influential revolutionary women‚Äôs club, Las Hijas de Cuba, she formed another women‚Äôs organization known as Las Patriotas de Cuba. Las Hijas de Cuba Founded on February 6, 1869 at the St. Julien Hotel near Washington Square in New York City, Las Hijas de Cuba was created by de Villaverde as a political organization for women fighting for Cuban independence.Mirabal, Nancy. \\"No Country But the One We Must Fight For: The Emergence of an Antillean Nation and Community in New York City, 1860-1901.\\" Mambo Montage: The Latinization of New York. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. 59‚Äì72. During this time, membership in revolutionary and cultural clubs was restricted to males only, forcing women to form their own organizations. Fourteen Cuban and Puerto Rican women gathered at this initial meeting to discuss helping Cuban soldiers and to criticize the all-male independence organization, Junta Revolucionaria de Cuba y Puerto Rico. As president of Las Hijas de Cuba, Emilia Casanova de Villaverde condemned this all-male club for their \\"annexationist maneuvers and betrayal of the independence movement.\\" The members of Las Hijas de Cuba, aware of the United States' growing interest in controlling Caribbean nations, disapproved of the fact that the Junta considered the United States an ally. They feared that this would move Cuba closer to annexation by the United States rather than emancipation. The collective power of these women's efforts gained attention and garnered further support for Villaverde. The leaders of Junta Revolucionaria de Cuba y Puerto Rico formed a new club called La Liga shortly after, which came to be dominated by annexationists. Villaverde used her platform as president of Las Hijas de Cuba to become a more recognizable force within the independence movement. The organization played an important role in raising funds for Cuban soldiers during the Ten Years' War. Additionally, as a representative of Las Hijas de Cuba, Emilia Casanova de Villaverde presented the merits of Cuban liberation before the U.S. Congress on numerous occasions. She was the first Cuban woman granted the right to address the United States Congress on this issue. When her father was imprisoned in Havana during the Ten Years' War, Villaverde spoke with U.S. government officials, including President Ulysses S. Grant, asking for protection. Spain accused many members of the property-owning Creole class of \\"infidelity\\" during this contentious time, loosely defined as any actions disrupting the political order, and confiscated their property as punishment.Perez, Louis. On Becoming Cuban: Identity, Nationality, and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999. President Grant agreed to protect her father from the Spanish government and soon after Villaverde's father was released. In 1871 and 1872, she again petitioned the United States Congress to support Cuban independence rather than Spanish colonial power. In 1871, Emilia Casanova de Villaverde pleaded the U.S. government for assistance after learning that eight medical school students at the University of Havana were being held hostage by Spanish authorities. In 1872, she informed Washington officials of Spain's hostile behavior on the island of Cuba and presented an extensive argument detailing the economic advantages of aiding Cuba over Spain. Despite de Villaverde‚Äôs efforts, the U.S. government decided it would be most strategic to side with a weak colonial power rather than a sovereign Cuba. In order to increase the international visibility of the Cuban emancipation struggle, she wrote to prominent European figures such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Hugo. In an 1869 letter to Giuseppe Garibaldi, Villaverde stated her abolitionist views: ‚Äúthe beginning of our revolution means the freedom of our slaves, giving them arms and incorporating them in our patriotic ranks.‚Äù Garibaldi responded to her appeal by stating that he supported Cuba‚Äôs quest for freedom from colonial oppression, but he did not make any specific commitments to aid the movement. Later years Emilia Casanova de Villaverde remained staunchly involved in the fight for Cuban liberation until her death on March 4, 1897. When her husband Cirilo Villaverde died in 1894, she briefly traveled to Cuba for his burial, but decided to return to New York City to continue working for Cuban independence for the remainder of her life. Her death in 1897 occurred just a year before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, which resulted in Cuba's independence. Just a few years earlier, in 1895, the Cubans went to war inspired by writers and thinkers such a Jose Marti, considered the father of the country. The Cuban \\"Mambises\\" as the revolutionaries were known, led by Generals Antonio Maco, Calixto Garcia and the Dominican Maximo Gomez had driven the Spaniards to a stalemate when the explosion of the USS Maine occurred. Because of this incident, the United States declared war on Spain and sent troops to Cuba, which resulted in the Spaniards defeat and their transferring Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines to U.S. control. After five years of U.S. rule and the Cuban revolutionaries making it clear that they would fight the Americans if they stayed as conquerors, the U.S. allowed Cuban independence and self-rule, but managed to insert a clause in the Cuban Constitution called the Platt Amendment, which permitted the U.S. to intervene in Cuba whenever the U.S. decided the Cuban government was not stable. After several such interventions in the early 20th century, the Platt amendment was revoked in the 1930s by mutual agreement.

Founded in 1875 and incorporated in 1904, the NSMA is a non-profit organization that consists of physicians, medical students, and residents. It is currently based in Reno, Nevada. The NSMA is the Nevada affiliate of the American Medical Association. History Henry Bergstein, MD was elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1874, and sponsored a successful bill to regulate the practice of medicine in the state. The law passed in 1875, and it limited the practice of medicine and surgery to graduates of bona fide medical schools. The law required physicians to register with their county, and assigned a fine to those who were not in compliance. In 1875, Bergstein founded the Nevada State Medical Society (NSMS) in Virginia City, Nevada to enforce the new law. John W. Van Zant, MD was elected the first president. The Nevada Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional, and in 1899, the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners was created to supplant the enforcement role of the NSMS. The NSMS was incorporated in 1904 with the Nevada Secretary of State, and the first annual meeting of the reorganized NSMS was held in Reno on May 6, 1905. The Clark County Medical Society was granted a charter in 1930, and the White Pine County Medical Society held their first meeting in 1931.

Krishnakumar makes use of his position in good ways and eradicates most of the corrupt evil activities in the state with the help of Police force and his friends.

The work was created in 1953 by Rauschenberg erasing a drawing he obtained from the American artist Willem de Kooning. Rauschenberg asked his friend Jasper Johns to add a written caption to the frame, which reads: \\"Erased de Kooning Drawing, Robert Rauschenberg, 1953‚Äù. It is considered a Neo-Dadaist conceptual artwork, with similarities affinities to Added Art, although with material removed from the original work rather than added. It has been held by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art since 1998, which describes the work as a \\"drawing [with] traces of drawing media on paper with label and gilded frame\\". Development The work is a development from Rauschenberg's early monochrome white paintings that he first created in summer 1951. After creating a series of completely blank white paintings, Rauschenberg set out to discover whether an artwork could be produced entirely through erasure. He started with erasing his own drawings, but felt that the result was not sufficiently creative, so he decided to seek a drawing from another more established artist - clearly already a work of art - that he could erase. He approached de Kooning, an artist he admired, to ask for a drawing that he could erase to create a new work of art. After some persuasion, de Kooning gave Rauschenberg a densely worked drawing in crayon, ink, pencil and charcoal, deliberately steering away from works that he did not like, or simple pencil drawings that would be too easy for Rauschenberg to erase. It took Rauschenberg approximately two months to obliterate as much of de Kooning drawing as he could, using a variety of different erasers. The plain gilded frame and inscription by Jasper Johns are important parts of the work: without them, a viewer would struggle to interpret the work. Existing copies No photographs exist of the de Kooning work before its erasure, but digital photographs made by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2010 enhanced the remaining traces of the underlying drawing, although some may have been erased by de Kooning as part of the initial creation of the work before he gave it to Rauschenberg. De Kooning's original drawing appears to be a studio sketch, with several figures facing in different directions, including at least one female, probably made with pencil and charcoal. Exhibitions The work, including its frame, measures . It was not exhibited in public until 1963, but Rauschenberg would show it to visitors to his studio, and it became well known. Some considered the destruction of a de Kooning drawing to be an act of vandalism; others recognised the concept of Rauschenberg's new work. It was bought by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1998 using a gift from Phyllis Wattis.

C. & G. Knudsen in Porsgrunn, Telemark, Norway. The ship, which was designed by naval architect Randulf Hansen and constructed at Laxevaags Maskin- og Jernskibsbyggeri in Bergen, was the first sailing ship constructed with steel in Norway and for a time the largest Norwegian sailing vessel ever built. However, the ship struggled to compete in the 20th century with the advent of the steamship, and in 1924 she was decommissioned and sold for scrap. Skomv√¶r entered the public eye once again in 1960, when musician Erik Bye wrote the song \\"Skomv√¶rsvalsen\\" as a tribute to the ship and her crew. A fundraising effort by the artist led to the construction of the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue boat Skomv√¶r II that same year, and in 1986 the organization named another of its boats, Skomv√¶r III, after the ship. History Christen Knudsen moved from his hometown of Saltr√∏d, near Arendal, to Porsgrunn in 1855. There he became a very successful ship-owner, and built a shipyard on the former site of the Frednes farm at the mouth of the Porsgrunn River. In his older years, Christen Knudsen decided to gradually hand over control of his shipping company to his two sons, J√∏rgen Christian Knudsen and Gunnar Knudsen. These men would both go on to become successful politicians in addition to their shipping trade. J√∏rgen Christian Knudsen, who built the house on √òvre Frednes, was the mayor of Porsgrunn in 1893 as well as a long- running Conservative Party representative in Stortinget for Porsgrunn. He was a polarizing figure in both national and local politics‚Äîhe argued in Stortinget to continue the union between Sweden and Norway and was the only vote in Porsgrunn City Council against the construction of a bridge across the Porsgrunn River, opting for a steam-powered ferry instead. Gunnar Knudsen was a Liberal Party politician who was Prime Minister of Norway from 1908 to 1910 and from 1913 to 1920, and was pivotal in the creation of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate as well as SKK, the precursor to Skagerak Energi. The two men also both had close descendants that worked in politics‚ÄîJ√∏rgen Christian Knudsen's son, Christen Knudsen, was the Nasjonal Samling representative for Telemark during World War II, and his grandson, Harald Franklin Knudsen, was Vidkun Quisling's private secretary. Gunnar Knudsen's son, Knut Andreas Knudsen, was a deputy representative in Stortinget for Telemark. The two brothers started the firm J. C. & G. Knudsen in 1872 to manage their father's assets. In 1879, their father's shipyard on Frednes was closed, but the men continued to have success trading with their existing fleet of merchant ships. When steel began to supplant cast iron as a sturdy shipbuilding material, the men asked Randulf Hansen, a naval architect from Bergen who had studied under the likes of Ananias Dekke and Jens Gran, to design a grand new steel sailing ship for their fleet. Construction Hansen, who was known for his use of clipper-style bows and soft lines, drew up a plan for the ship, to which Gunnar Knudsen made a few alterations to increase the carrying capacity by 50 register tons. The ship's hull was to be built with steel plates with a controlled carbon content, which was advanced technology at the time, and would have a barque sail-plan, with three masts carrying a total of 26 sails, including topsails, staysails, headsails and gaff-rigged sails. Construction took place at the shipyard Laxevaags Maskin- og Jernskibsbyggeri in Laksev√•g, Bergen, and the ship was launched on 23 April 1890, costing 284,995 kroner in all. The speech for the handing over of the ship was given by the shipping magnate Christian Michelsen, who was chairman of the Bergen company at the time and went on to become Norway's first Prime Minister after the dissolution of the Norwegian-Swedish union. The ship was christened by Augusta Rafn, the young daughter of the ship's first captain, Hans Christian Rafn. The ship was named Skomv√¶r, after the newly built Skomv√¶r Lighthouse southwest of R√∏stlandet, and launched in September of that year with a crew of 23 men. Unfortunately, Gunnar Knudsen was not able to see the project to completion, as J. C. & G. Knudsen had been dissolved the year before. The assets were divided in an equal arrangement between the brothers, leaving J√∏rgen Christian Knudsen with Skomv√¶r. Gunnar Knudsen started a new company, Aktieselskabet Borgestad, to manage his assets, and the company still exists today as a shipping, industry, and real estate firm. The Det Norske Veritas merchant vessels registry from 1907 showed that J√∏rgen Christian Knudsen owned four ships, the steamships Fredn√¶s and Taormina along with the sailing ships Korsvei and Skomv√¶r, and his son Finn Christian Knudsen's company Langesundsfjordens Bugser-D/S owned a single sailing ship, Storegut. Gunnar Knudsen had a bigger operation, owning the sailing ship Gjendin along with five steamships managed by his company: Borgestad, Brand, Breid, Britannic, and Christen Knudsen (Breid and Christen Knudsen were later sunk by Kaiserliche Marine subs during World War I). Whereas Gunnar Knudsen's ships had a total carrying capacity of 8898 net register tons between them, J√∏rgen Christian Knudsen and his son's ships had a capacity of only 3885 net register tons altogether. heeling significantly at a speed of 14.5 knots on her way to Australia in 1897. Photo signed \\"J√∂rgen C. Knudsen.\\" Operation Although steamships had already begun to dominate the shipping trade, Skomv√¶r still did good business in the first few decades of the 20th century due to her high storage capacity and advanced construction. To stay profitable the ship took whatever jobs were available, carrying a variety of cargo over long distances. On 6 June 1908, the ship began one of many such voyages, departing from Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia with coal for delivery to Valpara√≠so in Chile. However, disaster struck on 3 July, when a strong gust of wind caused the ship to heel and the cargo to shift, resulting in her sailing with an unsafe angle of list. The crewmen were forced to cut down parts of the rig to keep the ship upright. The situation worsened as the winds picked up and more of the rig broke down, making maneuvering difficult. Though the ship sustained heavy damages, the crew trimmed some of the cargo and continued the journey. On 17 July the ship was offered assistance by the crew of the British steamship Frankby, but refused. Skomv√¶r arrived in Valpara√≠so as a wreck on 25 August, where she was unloaded and underwent heavy repairs. The repairs were finally completed on 25 January 1909. The first captain of Skomv√¶r was Hans Christian Rafn from Porsgrunn, whose son, Robert Rafn, married one of J√∏rgen Christian Knudsen's daughters. Hans Christian Rafn served as captain up until his death on 26 June 1899 in New York City. He was succeeded by Niels Eriksen from Fredrikstad from 1899 to 1919, who was himself replaced by J√∏rgens S√∏rensen Berg from Larvik who held the position for just a few months in 1919. Herman Johnsen from H√∏v√•g took over the position from 1920 to 1921, and Mathias Andreas Moll√∏ from Grimstad served as the ship's final captain from 1921 to 1924. In August 1915, Skomv√¶r was sold to Ole Christian Axelsen, a wealthy businessman and member of the Order of St. Olav from the town of Bakke in Flekkefjord. He sold the ship in July 1917 to A/S Christianssand, who in 1923 sold her to A/S Norsk Rutefart, both companies managed by Sven Olaus Stray of Kristiansand. On 9 November 1922, Skomv√¶r was laid up near Kristiansand, never to see service again. By the time she was decommissioned, the ship had transported many types of goods all across the world, including grain from Australia, coal from England, lumber from Sweden, saltpeter from Chile, cognac from Marseille, and break bulk cargo from Spain. She had also made a total of 31 trips on the turbulent seas around Cape Horn. In February 1924, the ship was sold to Stavanger Ophugningskompani, a wrecking yard in Stavanger, who dismantled her for scrap. Legacy In 1960, Skomv√¶r was given a new lease of life when Norwegian folk singer and television and radio presenter Erik Bye released his first studio album, Vi g√•r ombord. The sixth track on the album, \\"Skomv√¶rsvalsen\\" (), which was co-written with Bjarne Amdahl, became one of Bye's biggest hits and received heavy rotation on the NRK radio show √ònskekonserten. The track gained additional popularity from being featured on the annual NRK Christmas broadcast \\"Vi g√•r ombord,\\" where the song was performed by the Norwegian Seamen's Choir. The song was recorded as a tribute to Skomv√¶r and her crew, with its well-known opening line \\"And the ship was named Skomv√¶r in Porsgrunn city.\\" Bye was also involved with the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue (NSSR), and during a radio broadcast on Christmas Eve in 1959, he had initiated fundraising for a new rescue boat to be donated to the organization. The original plan was to build a 55-foot-long vessel, but fundraising went so well that they pushed up the fundraising target to fund an 87-foot boat identical to the rescue boat Haakon VII. The method of funding was selling shares of the boat for five kroner per piece as well as ten kroner shares that entitled the owner to ride on the boat during the official launch. The contract to build the boat was signed with the Stord- based firm AS Stord Verft by NRK director-general and later Labor Party politician Kaare Fostervoll. The boat cost 1.55 million kroner and had a 525-horsepower Bergen Marine diesel engine that could achieve speeds of up to 11 knots. She was delivered to the NSSR on 11 June 1960. The boat, which was named Skomv√¶r II in honor of the original merchant ship, was christened by Augusta Rafn, then aged 90, who had also christened the original Skomv√¶r. furled. In 1986, the NSSR spent 5.3 million kroner on a new rescue boat, Skomv√¶r III, with two 625-horsepower MAN Diesel engines giving her a top speed of 25 knots. They sold Skomv√¶r II that same year for 1.6 million kroner to the Swedish Sea Rescue Society, who renamed the boat Hans Hansson. The boat has since been bought by Gordon Fitton, an English geophysicist residing in Alderney in the Channel Islands, who undertook a complete restoration of the boat and named her Skomv√¶r II once again. Skomv√¶r III is still in operation as a rescue ship and is stationed in Lofoten near her namesake, Skomv√¶r Lighthouse. In 2005, the Norwegian brand Toro announced a new product, Skomv√¶r Fish Soup, that would donate one kroner of every sale to the NSSR. The Bergen- based company chose the name because of their proximity to the former site of Laxevaags Maskin- og Jernskibsbyggeri, who built the first Skomv√¶r. By 2007 they had raised 740,000 kroner for the organization.

The precursor shallow depression developed within the monsoon trough during January 13, to the west of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu. On January 16, the storm developed-hurricane-force winds and Eric began to undergo rapid deepening. While two different agencies differ on when and how strong Eric was at its peak, it was believed to have peak on January 17 while passing through the Fiji island group. Shortly after its peak, Eric began to weaken steadily, and by January 20, Severe Tropical Cyclone Eric had ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone. Cyclone Eric combined with another storm (Cyclone Nigel) brought 25 fatalities. Eric caused $40 million (1985 USD) worth of damage. A total of 299 farms were affected as well as the airport in Nadi. About 30,000 people were left homeless. Severe crop damage was also reported. Viti Levu sustained the worst effects from Cyclone Eric. During the aftermath of the storm, a number of first world countries distributed aid for victims of Eric. __TOC__ Meteorological history On January 13, 1985 the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor a shallow depression, that had developed within the monsoon trough about to the west of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu. Over the next day as the system moved eastwards it developed further, with satellite imagery showing an increase in the \\"cyclonic curvature\\" of the \\"convective cloud\\". As a result, early on January 14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) reported that the systems chances of becoming a tropical cyclone were good. During that day the system rapidly developed further and became better defined with gale-force winds developing near the centre, with the JTWC initiating advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 11P at 12:00 UTC (00:00 FST). Four hours later as the system moved closer to Espiritu Santo, the FMS named the system Eric as it had become equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone on the modern day Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Eric subsequently passed near or over Espiritu Santo during January 15, before it turned and accelerated south-eastwards. Eric subsequently became equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone early the next day, before an Air Pacific flight from Fiji to the Solomon Islands located the systems eye on radar. The eye subsequently appeared on satellite imagery later that day, before it came into the range of Nadi airports surveillance radar at around 00:30 UTC (12:30 FST) on January 17. The FMS were subsequently able to perform fixes on the systems eye until around 07:00 UTC (19:00 FST), when the radars antenna had to be taken down and locked away as the wind speeds at Nadi increased. During that day Eric's eye seemed to contract to around as it made passed through Fiji's Western Division and made landfall on the Fijian main island of Viti Levu about to the south of Nadi. Ahead of the system making landfall the FMS estimated that the system had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind-speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph). After the system had made landfall the JTWC estimated that Eric had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 185 km/h (115 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson hurricane wind scale. At around 10:45 UTC (22:45 FST) after the winds at Nadi had decreased the FMS were able to bring the radar back into operation and noted that Eric's eye region had been modified by the landmass of Viti- Levu. The system subsequently passed near or over Fiji's capital: Suva, before it emerged into the Koro Sea and weakened below hurricane force. The system passed about to the south of the Fijian Island, Moala at around 14:30 UTC (02:30 FST, December 18). The system subsequently exited the Fijian Islands shortly afterwards and was heading towards the Tongan Ha ªapai Group of islands. Early on January 18, Eric passed through the Ha'apai islands just to the south of Nomuka. After affecting the Tongan islands, Eric moved south- eastwards and gradually weakened further before it was last noted during January 20, over to the south of Papeete, French Polynesia. Impact Fiji Eric was the first of two severe tropical cyclones to make landfall, on the Fijian Island of Viti Levu within 36 hours and was also the first of four tropical cyclones to impact Fiji during 1985. Ahead of Eric making landfall on the Fijian Islands during January 17, the FMS issued alerts and warnings for various parts of the country including Viti Levu and the Yasawa and Mamanuca island groups. Offices in Suva were closed around during the afternoon hours of January 17 local time, enabling time to let the workers prepare their houses and businesses. All ships moved out of the port of Suva and took shelter elsewhere. In addition, the Nadi airport was closed and flights were diverted away from Fiji. Residents took shelter wherever they could to survive the storm. Affecting a densely populated part of the island group, Eric brought $40 million (USD) in damage and took 25 lives. Extensive wind damage was reported; crop damage from Eric was also severe. Over of rainfall fell in some places, resulting in extensive flooding. The combined systems destroyed 9,500 homes; many schools, shops and, hotels had to be rebuilt because of the storm. Many recreational facilities as well as may commercial builds were also party or completely destroyed by the cyclone. About 30,000 persons were reported as homeless. A total of 299 farms were affecting by the storm, resulting in nearly $2 million in damage; however damage to the pine plantations was minor. Across Viti Levu, serious damage was reported. The Nadi airport was closed during the storm; four days after the passage of Eric, the airport re-opened for night operations. Damage from the airport alone totaled $1 million. The west part of Viti Levu as well as some other surrounding islands sustained the worst damage, though interior areas of Viti Levu suffered from severe crop damage. Other islands Cyclone Eric was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu within a week, however, there was no significant damage reported after Cyclone Eric passed through the northern islands of Vanuatu. Heavy rain associated with the system helped ease a drought in the island nation, while all 3 cyclones disrupted inter-island transport. Within Tonga there was no casualties or major damage reported, however, around 80% of the banana crop was damaged while several homes and a wharf were destroyed. Aftermath During the initial aftermath of Cyclone Eric the Fijian Government's Emergency Services Committee met regularly to coordinate relief efforts, with aerial and ground surveys of the cyclone damaged areas starting during January 18. Ships were also dispatched to the outer islands, in order to deliver relief supplies and assess the damage. However, the completion of these surveys had to be postponed, as Severe Tropical Cyclone Nigel made landfall on Fiji. Throughout the region relief centers were set up to accommodate the homeless, before they were closed towards the end of January with victims given various shelter materials and food supplies. During January 22, the Fijian Government outlined their long-term rehabilitation needs and requested international assistance from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization and other countries. These needs included a 6-month food-rationing project for 10,000 households, a rehabilitation program for 10,000 shelters and improved internal communication including between the FMS in Nadi and the capital city Suva. Administration of the relief and rehabilitation program was transferred from the Emergency Services Committee to the Prime Minister's Relief and Rehabilitation Committee on January 31.

In the end of the 17th century the Uue-Antsla (New Antsla) manor (Neu-Anzen) was detached from the manor, therefore the old one gained the name Vana-Antsla (Old Antsla). After the Great Northern War the manor was owned by the L√∂wenstern family and from 1883 by the Ungern-Sternbergs. After the Estonian independence in 1919 the manor was dispossessed like all the others around the country. The complex had since been used as an agricultural vocational school until it was closed in 2012. Most of the historical buildings have survived, including the single-storey main building from the 18th century. Before 1977 the settlement was called Kobela, but was renamed to Vana-Antsla when a new small borough 4 km southwest was created and named Kobela. The gardener's house of the manor.

The 2013 budget estimated total revenue of A$387.7 billion and spending of A$398.3 billion, a deficit of A$18 billion, with a return to surplus expected in the 2015 Australian federal budget (FY 2015/16). Some of the measures in the budget had been announced by various Ministers before the budget. According to Swan the budget was being impacted by both global economic uncertainty and the high Australian dollar. It features significant spending on disability services and a school improvement program based on the Gonski Report. In an unusual step the election year budget contains 10-year forward estimates for the school and disability programs in an attempt to ensure funding is available. To pay for DisabilityCare Australia the Medicare levy was increased from 1.5 to 2% of taxable income from 1 July 2014. The budget was described as big spending but low taxing. It lacked any big surprises or so-called election sweeteners. Forecasts Deficit  The budget was not expected to decrease government spending dramatically in an effort to quickly return to surplus. Swan has claimed that such a move would result in rising unemployment and slowing economic growth. A collapse in the price of carbon under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme means a return to surplus is unlikely in the following two federal budgets. The forecasted current account deficit is lower than the average for the past couple of decades allowing Standard and Poor's assessment of Australia's bond credit rating to remain at the AAA rating. Shortfall Tax revenue declines made it clear in late 2012 that the Gillard Government's promised 2013 budget surplus would not eventuate. In the lead up to the budget announcement an estimate of a $17.5 billion decline in forecast revenue was calculated after Finance Minister Penny Wong released government figures. Most of this shortfall was attributed to company tax and the mining tax. A deficit of up to $10 billion in the 2013‚Äì14 financial was predicted by some economists. In early May 2013, the Parliamentary Budget Office forecast that the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) would only raise $800 million this year instead of $3 billion which was originally expected. Revenues Taxation In March 2013, Prime Minister Julia Gillard indicated an increase on the tax on superannuation contributions was likely. On 1 May 2013, Gillard announced a 0.5% increase of the Medicare levy to fund DisabilityCare Australia which will take effect on 1 July 2014, and which is expected to raise $11 billion over four years. Korjon, a praised economist, states that Swan's implementations within this years fiscal policy is to be successful and a \\"kick starter\\" towards its upcoming budget surplus. Conversely, Andrew argues that the improvements in taxation revenues will not take significant effect for a surplus. The budget included measures to counter tax avoidance by closing a loophole in which companies claim large tax deductions after increasing their Australian operations with debt. A$2,000 cap on tax deductions for work-related education expense was introduced in the budget. Expenditure General government A few days before the budget was delivered, Treasurer Swan announced the public service was to receive a $580 million reduction in funding over four years. Expenditure on asylum seekers was forecast to be $2.9 billion, an increase of $930 million over previous year, as arrivals were expected to reach a record high. Social security and welfare Included in the introduction of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax was an increase in the Family Tax Benefit Part A scheme. Finance Minister Penny Wong announced the cancellation of the increase prior to the release of the 2013 budget. It was intended to be a measure that would spread the wealth of the mining boom, however as revenue from that tax was significantly lower than expected, the payment had to be scrapped. The increase in the benefit was expected to go to around 1.5 million families. The baby bonus was abolished and replaced with a family tax benefit equivalent to less than half of the then-current payment. The payment was to cease on 1 March 2014, reducing expenditure by $1.1 billion over five years, and being replaced with an increase in family tax benefits which will be means-tested and limited to $2,000 for the first born and $1,000 for subsequent children. The budget didn't contain a raise in the Newstart Allowance despite widespread calls for its increase. Instead the amount of money the unemployed may earn before it affects welfare payments was increased. The change was estimated to cost $258 million over four years. $99.4 million was provided for a new Farm Household Allowance for eligible farmers facing hardship, replacing the previous Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment and Transitional Farm Family Payment. The payment will begin on 1 July 2014 and be equivalent to the Newstart Allowance. A farm finance scheme is to be introduced which will support farmers in debt. Infrastructure, transport and energy $400 million was provided for the construction of an eight km tunnel linking the Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle Freeway and M2 Hills Motorway in Sydney. $3 billion worth of funding out of a total cost of $8 billion for the Melbourne Metro Rail Project rapid transit rail project was allocated in the budget on the condition that Victoria fund an equal amount. $715 million was committed to the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane. Queensland's Transport Minister Scott Emerson was expecting twice as much for a 50‚Äì50 cost shared between federal and state governments. Education The Australian Indigenous Education Foundation was provided with an additional $22 million. Bonuses paid to those who pay their HECS debts up-front or voluntarily will cease, saving $237 million. Defence The budget provided funding for new 12 radar-jamming Growler Super Hornet fighter aircraft. Overall spending on defence is up $10 billion compared to the previous year. Health The net medical expenses tax offset is to be phased out over two years. A total of $14.3 billion worth of new funding was allocated to DisabilityCare Australia. Community services and culture The cost of 457 temporary skilled migrant visas was doubled to $900. Opposition and crossbench response Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey described the budget as \\"fundamentally dishonest\\". Tony Abbott claimed Julia Gillard was in denial over whether or not there was a spending problem. Australian Greens leader Christine Milne said the budget lacked vision and was a disappointment to rural communities. Reception Even before the budget was released the business community, as represented by the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Minerals Council of Australia, complained the budget would be lacking in both transparency and credibility and was achieved without genuine consultation. Australian Education Union President Angelo Gavrielatos praised the school reforms saying they would benefit children and the nation as a whole. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia supported the governments intention to maintain permanent migration and humanitarian intake levels as they were. Asylum seekers advocates questioned the expense of off-shore detention centres and processing. Indigenous organisations reacted with a mixed response. Some columnists questioned whether the forecast revenue would be as high as predicted especially considering the effect of a high Australian dollar. The assumption that Australia's gross domestic product will grow by 5% per year was also questioned. Representatives from the National Welfare Rights Network and the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children criticised the lack of an increase in dole payments, particularly after many single mothers were transferred to Newstart in January.

Her renowned critical book, Signifying Pain: Construction and Healing the Self through Writing published by SUNY Press and is taught in many graduate seminars. Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, coauthor of Cherishment: A Psychology of the Heart, said, \\"Signifying Pain will play an important role in the growing literature on psychoanalysis in education and in the college classroom, as it both shows and tells what a psychoanalytically informed sensibility can bring to understanding poetry. To be able to signify pain is a human triumph; to write about the signifying is, too.\\" Her third, and most recent, collection of poetry, Night Garden, was published April 2013 by Tiger Bark Press, a literary press founded by Steven Huff, previously the executive director of BOA Editions. On Night Garden, Edward Hirsch said, ‚ÄúJudith Harris creates tableaux of memory and shines a keen light on the particulars of the natural world in these poignant, carefully observed, and scrupulously written poems that ache with mortality. Night Garden is an illuminating book!‚Äù Jeanne Marie Beaumont said, ‚ÄúPiercingly visionary and subtly hallucinatory, over and over these poems acknowledge the vast mysterious companionship of the natural world and the fluidity of experienced time. As the poems bring things to notice, whether the hum of Sears fans, the oddments on a basement worktable, or the smell of a pharmacy aisle, they create a new way to be intimate with the physical world. It is as though Keats's ‚Äúhark!‚Äù has awoken this poet to her fullest senses, and there is no turning away. Night Garden is dug deep and flourishing.‚Äù Her essays been published and in many journals and anthologies including Tikkun, College English, The Washingtonian. She has contributed articles to many anthologies and collections on poetry and the history of American poetry including Graywolf Press's After Confession and Simply Lasting: Writers on Jane Kenyon, and interviews of Ted Kooser and Edward Hirsch for The Writer's Chronicle of Associated Writing Programs. Her essay from Simply Lasting was selected to be in American Literature's two volume collection of twentieth century literature. She is a prolific reviewer of poetry with reviews in NEO, Spoon River Review, Psychohistory Forum, American Imago, and Psychoanalysis, Society and Culture (Palgrave). Her poems have appeared in The Nation, Slate, The Hudson Review, Ploughshares, The New Republic, The Atlantic and Narrative magazine, Southern Review, the American Scholar, Prairie Schooner and American Life in Poetry, which is a syndicated newspaper column edited by Ted Kooser, publishing her work in places such as The New York Times, The Seattle Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and many others.
