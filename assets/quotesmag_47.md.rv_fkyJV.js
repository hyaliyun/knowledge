Sao Sao Sao made first album \\"Ruk Puk Jai\\" in 1981 and released in 1982 but the album is bad-selling because the musics are too elder to their ages.

The estate has been the property of the Kelly family since approximately 1100. Parts of the original Medieval house and great hall are still standing, though they are obscured from view, as this part of the house was significantly remodelled in the Tudor architectural style. In 1742 the west wing of the building was constructed in the Georgian architectural style and surrounded by parkland. The most recent north wing of Kelly House was built in 1877. During the twentieth century parts of the estate were sold off, and the house fell into disrepair. A description of life in the house and village during the first world war was written as a diary by Margaret Kelly, the lady of the house at the time. It includes details of the running of the house. After the war Mary Kelly founded the Village Drama Society which was based at Kelly House from 1919 until about 1925. Kelly House continues to be inhabited by members of the Kelly family while opening some rooms for bed and breakfast basis. The house was added to the Heritage at Risk Register due to concerns particularly about the leaking roof. Parts of the house have been restored, with students from Kelly College assisting with the works. These parts of the house are open to the public through guided tours, and since 2013 the house has offered three bedrooms as bed & breakfast accommodation. In April 2010, Kelly House was the subject of a Channel 4 television programme presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her Country House Rescue series.

Seventeen minutes before the bomb exploded a telephone warning was received saying that a car bomb was somewhere in the centre of Newry and that it would go off in half an hour. The police removed people from their homes and the centre of the town. The car was a Mazda 6 loaded with 115 kg of explosives. The car exploded next to the gates of a courthouse.

Because of the size of the bomb, the police termed it a \\"sheer miracle\\" that no one was injured. According to the BBC, it is thought that this was the first \\"large car bomb\\" to have exploded in Northern Ireland since the 2000 bombing of the Stewartstown police station. Other car bombs have failed to explode, or have only partially exploded. The bombing is thought to have been an attempt to undo the 2010 Hillsborough Castle Agreement, although the fact that it came two weeks after the Agreement was signed is thought to reflect the militant's limited operational capacity.

Lua is also used for configuring and extending the window manager. Its development began as a fork of dwm. It aims to be extremely small and fast, yet extensively customizable. It makes it possible for the user to manage windows with the use of keyboard. The fork was initially nicknamed jdwm, with \\"jd\\" denoting the principal programmer's initials, and with dwm reminding of the software project it forked from. The first git repository for what was to become awesome was set up in September 2007. jdwm was renamed to awesome, named after the same phrase used by the How I Met Your Mother character Barney Stinson. awesome was officially announced on the dwm mailing list on September 20, 2007. Aim of the project Awesome has emerged as a dwm fork featuring customization through external configuration files (see Configuration and customization below). Although highly extensible, the default setup of the window manager is deliberately simplified. In doing so, the author has created what he calls a framework window manager for users to expand and adapt to their own needs. Features * Configured via a Lua configuration file. * Like dwm and wmii, awesome uses tags instead of workspaces. Windows can be assigned to several tags, and multiple tags can be selected at the same time. * As a dynamic window manager, awesome can switch between different layouts for each tag, including floating, several dynamic tiling layouts, maximized and magnifier. * Multiple and per screen status bars, including a variety of widgets (text and icon boxes, graphs, progress bars, and so on). * Everything can be done with the keyboard, so usage of a mouse is optional. * Multihead support (XRandR, Xinerama or Zaphod mode). * Implements freedesktop.org standards including EWMH, XDG Base Directory, XEmbed, Desktop Notification and System Tray. * Compositing and true transparency support through an external compositor such as xcompmgr. * Remote control via D-Bus (awesome-client). * Supports the pango markup language. Configuration and customization From the very beginning, awesome was conceived as a dwm fork with an external configuration file. As such, its configuration file format, and the process of configuration itself, was subject to special attention by the author. Early configuration file formats Prior to the third major release, one of awesome's features was what Danjou termed a 'no complicated configuration'.awesome 3: Lua integration First versions of awesome (1.x) were simple modification of dwm with flat file configuration which used libconfig. In 2.x branch, Danjou changed the configuration library from libconfig to libconfuse, a different flat file configuration library, somewhat resembling libconfig. During the development of 2.x releases, many customization features were added to awesome, such as titlebars and icon drawing. New configuration file On May 20, 2008, Danjou announced in an e-mail to the awesome mailing listNews on awesome-3 and about latest commits (May 20, 2008) that a new format for the configuration file will be used in 3.0 release. The new format was placed in a file ~/.awesomerc.lua, and was later moved to ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua. As the extension suggests, the configuration file is written in the Lua programming language. Danjou argued that the new format and Lua integration would enable awesome users to customize awesome in ways he previously considered impossible: using a programming language for configuration made it possible to dynamically specify configuration options. The awesome Lua API is now hosted on awesome's homepage,awesome API documentation and a tutorial-style article about configuring awesome is posted on the awesome Wiki.Awesome 3 configuration Themes and widgets It is possible to theme (or skin) awesome by using the window manager's Beautiful library. awesome Wiki: Beautiful In line with rc.lua configuration file, theming is also done in Lua, allowing dynamic themes to be created. Although the default awesome configuration as of 3.2.1 release does not have any status indicators (like wireless network status, battery indicators, etc.), users can add these items using widgets. awesome Wiki: Widgets in awesome Data for the widgets is supplied using arbitrary Lua code since widgets are defined in the main configuration file. Migration to XCB The 3.0 version, released September 18, 2008, uses the XCB library to communicate with the X server,XCB transition announcement from XCB mailing list making awesome the first window manager to use this library instead of Xlib. Work on the XCB port was started by Arnaud Fontaine, one of the current Awesome developers,Community page on Awesome homepage: under Developers heading in January 2008. Arnaud Fontaine announced the move to XCB on the XCB mailing list on April 9, 2008. In his message to the list, he emphasized the following as main advantages of using XCB: \\"modular architecture; direct access to the protocols; multithreading; asynchronous requests/replies;\\". The XCB port was completed the following month and Danjou created a new branch based on XCB. Lua integration Because of the perceived problems that limited expanding and customization in pre-3.0 version of awesome, the author decided to integrate Lua-based configuration into awesome. The rc1 of the new Lua-scriptable implementation was announced in August 2008.3.0-rc1 announcement on awesome mailing list In September 2008, the first version of awesome with Lua API completed in parallel with XCB implementation.

It was the first of her highly acclaimed series of books about the Logan family.\\"Mildred D. Taylor\\", The Mississippi Writers Page, University of Mississippi. The novella follows the time Mr. Anderson tried to cut down the trees on the Logan family's land. The story revolves around Cassie Logan who tries to save the trees on her Big Ma's land. Even though Cassie's family needed some money, something told Cassie the trees were just as valuable. Song of the Trees is followed by three sequels: Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry (1976), Let the Circle Be Unbroken (1981), The Road to Memphis (1990), and a prequel, The Land (2001). Plot summary Eight-year-old Cassie Logan is woken up one sunny morning by her paternal grandmother, Big Ma. As she gathers herself together, she accidentally knocks into a chair. Prompted by Big Ma, she opens her bedroom window and gazes out into the field and examines the forest of trees that sits behind the house far back into the property. She admires them, but this is quickly short-lived as Big Ma tells her to get moving or else she'll whoop her. Cassie goes to the kitchen where her mother, Mary, is preparing breakfast. Her older brother, Stacey, is also in the kitchen setting up the fire in the oven with one of her younger brothers, Christopher-John. Mary is scolding Christopher-John for eating all of the cornbread in the middle of the night. While she doesn't want to let her children go hungry, she tells Christopher-John to ease up on his appetite. At this time, it is learned that her husband and the children's father, David Logan, is down in Louisiana laying down tracks on the railroad to support the family. Cassie's other youngest sibling, Little Man, enters and they get into a brief fight over a stain on his pants from the day before. Little Man believes Cassie is responsible for the stain. Their fight is interrupted by Stacey, but Cassie and Little Man decide to settle their differences on the matter later without Stacey around to see them. After breakfast, Cassie and her brothers go into the forest with their three cows and their offspring, walking them to a pond. It was a muggy morning, but the trees were keeping the heat out as their leaves blew above them. Cassie takes it as them singing and asks Stacey if he can see it too, but Stacey dismisses this and tells her that it's just the wind. Shortly after, Cassie asks Stacey about the well-being of their mother when overhearing her and Big Ma talk about medicine. Stacey assures her that their mother was alright but if she was ill, then it wasn't that serious for them to worry about. The kids leave the cows and their calves at the pond to drink water while they go out and pick blackberries. Along the way, the kids decide to play a quick game of hide-and-seek. Cassie notices the leaves of the trees stop moving. When Stacey approaches her, she tells him that they \\"aren't singing anymore\\". Stacey tells them that they should pick the berries now before it got too late. They come across two white men, Mr. Andersen and his partner Tom, who are talking about cutting down the trees. The kids hide so they aren't noticed. Mr. Andersen hasn't gone to spoke to Big Ma yet about taking the trees but is planning to do that soon. Tom is worried about David's reaction as he doesn't make dealings with white folks. Mr. Andersen assures him that David won't be a problem since he doesn't own the land and sends Tom on his way to get his team of lumbermen to start cutting down the trees for him to claim. The Logan kids hurry back to the house where they find Mr. Andersen there talking to their mother and Big Ma. Mr. Andersen offered up sixty-five dollars and says that's more than what David would make in two months. Mary objects the offer, feeling they can make it with the amount David sends. Mr. Andersen says that anything could happen to David and he could get into an accident. This worries Big Ma who quickly accepts the offer, but the kids quickly come in to protest. Cassie scolds Mr. Andersen, saying that the trees were her friends and wasn't going to let him cut them down. Her mother grabs a hold of her and sends her off to her room. That night, Cassie wakes up and looks outside the window of her room and sees Mama, Big Ma and Stacey on their mare, Lady. She asks her mother where Stacey was off to and Mary tells her that he was off to retrieve their father. Three days pass. On the fourth day since Stacey's departure, Cassie sees her mother walking alone through the forest. She decides to join her and ask how sick she was, remembering the conversation she had with Big Ma just days earlier. Mary tells her she was very much sick, but was going to feel better when David returned home. They enter into an area and see that many of the trees have already been cut down. The ones still standing had been marked with white X's to soon signal their cut-down. Mother and daughter held tight to each other and cried at the sight of this. After they returned to the house, Little Man decided he wanted to go look at the destruction for himself. Ignoring his mother's orders not to go into the forest, he does so anyway with Cassie and Christopher-John following him. They come across Mr. Andersen and his team of lumbermen who spot them. Mr. Andersen orders the children to return home, but when they refuse, Mr. Andersen has a black man named Claude handle them. Claude grabs a hold of Little Man who fights his way from him and was eventually shoved down. Cassie charges towards Mr. Andersen, but is stopped by Claude who carries her off with Christopher-John trailing behind trying to get Claude to let him go. He leaves them off at the pond for them to make the rest of the trip home. Not knowing where Little Man was, they go back to where Mr. Andersen and the lumbermen were and find him fighting with them. They fail to get him to stop and he hits Mr. Andersen in the leg with a huge stick. He quickly runs off, but is soon grabbed by the lumbermen. Cassie and Christopher-John order them to let him go and are also captured themselves. Christopher-John breaks free and charges at Mr. Andersen, kicking him in the shin twice.

As the name indicates, the skull is long and narrow. This would seem to indicate a different lifestyle or diet to other parieasaurs. More recently, it has been used as the monotypal species for the genus Nochelesaurus (it is not clear what the status of Embrithosaurus strubeni is, this may be a further transitional species). In cladistic analyses, this species is phylogenetically intermediate between Bradysaurus seeleyi and Embrithosaurus schwarzi . E. schwarzi (Watson, 1914);the type species. This is the most advanced species of this genus, as indicated by the teeth, which have nine cusps (in three groups of three). In cladistic analyses it is used as the monotypal species for the genus. E. strubeni (Broom, 1924);the skull is large and deep, pointed at the front, and elevated in the jugal region. This species was originally made the type species of Nochelosaurus by Haughton and Boonstra. Boonstra later (1969) moved it into the genus Bradysaurus, on the basis of the primitive tooth structure.

History In 1837, John Smith Wright of the Nottingham banking family, decided to form the Mechanics' Institute, modelled on the institutes which were becoming commonplace in other locations in the country. In October 1837 a meeting was held in the Town Hall at Weekday CrossNottingham Journal. 30 October 1837 at which 490 supporters put their names towards the scheme. The Institute rented premises at 17 St. James's Street from 1837 to 1845. The committee appointed John Porchett as the Librarian at a yearly salary of 12 guineas (). One of the first attractions of membership was free admission to body dissections at Nottingham General Hospital. In 1840, the Institution held the first ever art exhibition in Nottingham which in just 5 months attracted 224,000 visitors. The receipts from admission charges was ¬£2,996 (). Move to Milton Street On 28 January 1845, the Institution opened its own Mechanics' Hall on Milton Street. The architects of the building were Robert Jalland\\"Nottingham Mechanics Institute\\", The Illustrated London News. Vol 4 p. 149, 9 March 1844. and Thomas Hawksley of Middle Pavement.The Strangers' Guide to Nottingham. 1849 By this stage the library of the Institution contained some 40,000 volumes. Charles Dickens appeared at the Mechanics' Institute on 21 October 1858 and read his Christmas Carol.Nottingham Review. 15 October 1858 Fire of 1867 A fire on 14 March 1867 caused much damage, including the loss of the organ which had been installed in 1847. The Institute claimed ¬£3,950 () on the insurance. ¬£2,200 () was paid off the mortgage on the building, and a public appeal raised ¬£2,579 (). New building of 1869 A new hall with double the seating capacity of the old hall was designed by Thomas Simpson and opened on 19 January 1869. The new hall was , and . It had a floor-space of . It was lit by five clusters of 81 gas jets. Famous people who came to speak or perform at the Mechanics include: from Literature: Charles Dickens (3 times), Oscar Wilde (twice), Anthony Trollope, Jerome K Jerome, Wilkie Collins, GK Chesterton and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Explorers: HM Stanley, Captain Scott, Sir Ernest Shackleton and Edward Whymper (1st man to climb the Matterhorn). From the theatre and silver screen: Dame Anna Neagle. Entertainment was provided by Madame Tussaud and her Waxworks, Tom Thumb and the operatic diva Jenny Lind. Whilst from Egyptology came Sir Flinders Petrie and Arthur Weigall (speaking on \\"Excavating at Luxor\\" in 1924). In 1912 the adjacent Mansfield Road Baptist Church was purchased and converted into a lecture hall. Birkbeck House 1964 In 1964 the Mechanics' Institution decided to redevelop the building on the same site. The stone fa√ßade of the 1845 building was exported by an American and re-erected as his Californian hunting lodge. The new building was called Birkbeck House and cost around ¬£750,000 (). The Mechanics' used the first floor and rented out the rest of the building to tenants. At the opening in April 1966 the Mechanics was described thus: \\"It has survived because it has adapted itself to changing circumstances in this modern age and has at the same time preserved all the best traditions of the past\\". Facilities provided included: the Members' Lounge, Restaurant, Buttery (Members' Bar), Library & Quiet Room, Billiard Room, Card Room, Chess Room and Activities Room.

Being the Log of Captain John Sirius\\", was written 18 months before the outbreak of World War I and first published in the Strand Magazine in July 1914. It depicts an imaginary country in Europe fighting - and defeating - Britain, and is intended to direct public attention to the great danger (submarines) which threatened the country. Plot summary The story describes Britain's need to update its naval preparations. Norland, a fictional small country in Europe has been fighting England and is now invaded by an English army. However, Norland has a naval flotilla of submarines commanded by Captain John Sirius. Sirius uses his submarines to lay a naval blockade around the British Isles, so that no supplies can be landed. Consequently, the British start suffering famine. Some of the submarines are sunk and the British are congratulating themselves, when Sirius, waiting outside Liverpool, purposely torpedoes a large White Star liner, the RMS Olympic. The British end up surrendering. Analysis The story correctly anticipates the U-boat strategy which Germany would use in both World Wars to target ships bringing the foodstuffs Britain was unable to produce domestically. As would be confirmed by the events, the story forecast the need for the attackers to also target American ships bringing supplies to Britain - even at the price of violating International Law - forcing the British to introduce rationing among their population. At the time numerous popular writings portrayed England facing Germany in an upcoming war. The best remembered include Erskine Childers' The Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service (1903) and \\"Saki\\"'s When William Came: A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns (1913). Doyle's story is another example of this genre of invasion literature. Ironically, its conclusion foretold the fate of the Cunard liner Lusitania two years later. Doyle uses a particular stylistic technique to evoke emotion in British readers, making them more receptive to the writer's warnings: the first person narration by the victorious enemy commander, full of gloating and condescension towards the \\"stupid\\" Britons. Norland Norland is depicted as a North European country, with a shore on the North Sea. It seems to be linguistically Germanic - \\"Norrland\\" and \\"Nordland\\" are the names of a region in Sweden and a county in Norway, respectively, and Norland's main port is Blankenberg, the name of several actual German cities. Norland is, however, not Germany, which is mentioned as neutral in the war, though Germans are depicted as sympathetic to Norland's cause. Norland has a colonial empire, and a border dispute with a British colony, exacerbated by the death of two missionaries, is the direct cause of the war. Norland is a monarchy whose monarch seems to retain actual executive power; the crucial policy meeting in which it is resolved to defy a British ultimatum and embark on submarine warfare is attended by the king, the foreign secretary, an admiral, and Captain Sirius; a prime minister is conspicuously absent.

Stewart kept both businesses, and they flourished. By 1931, his sons Frank Sr. and Charles incorporated the business as the Acme Marble & Granite Co. In 1949, the company established Lake Lawn Park Cemetery in New Orleans and developed a large perpetual-care community mausoleum with more than 31,000 crypts.

It is essential for the initial building of the autophagosome and Cvt vesicles. In a non-kinase role it is - through complex formation with Atg13 and Atg17 - directly controlled by the TOR kinase, a sensor for nutrient availability.  Introduction  Atg1 can associate with a number of other proteins of the Atg family to form a complex that functions in autophagosome or Cvt vesicle formation. The initiation of autophagy involves the building of the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). Most Atg proteins accumulate at the PAS and generate either Cvt vesicles under normal growing conditions or autophagosomes under starvation. To date, there are 31 ATG genes, which can be classified into several different groups according to their functions at the different steps of the pathway. 17 of these genes only work in the Cvt pathway.  Structure  The Atg1 gene lies on chromosome VII of S. cerevisiae. The encoded protein with a mass of 101.7 kDa has a length of 897 amino acids and includes a protein serine/threonin kinase domain of 302 amino acids at its N-terminus. At the C-terminus, there is a 7 amino acid long region that is required for Cvt trafficking. The protein is also post-translationally modified through phosphorylation of at least 9 serine residues Until now, no crystal structure has been made of Atg1.  Function  Atg1 has two distinct functions in yeast (for higher eukaryotes see below): the kinase-independent recruitment of downstream Atg proteins (i.e. PAS organization) and a kinase-dependent function in autophagosome formation likely mediated by the phosphorylation of downstream substrates.  Interaction partners  An overview over the interactions partners of Atg1 in autophagy and Cvt Atg1 has been shown to interact with at least six other Atg proteins, namely Atg 29, 31, 11, 20 and 24. Of all these, Atg13 has been shown to have roles in both autophagy and Cvt functions; Atg17, 29 and 31 have only functions in autophagy, while Atg11, 20 and 24 only take part in the Cvt pathway. Based on yeast two-hybrid data and affinity isolation, Atg1 is found to be in a complex with Atg13 and Atg17. The observation that Atg17 interacts with Atg13 in the absence of Atg1 but not vice versa suggests that Atg13 mediates the interaction between Atg1 and Atg17.  Regulation  Regulation of the Atg1 complex by TOR under nutrient conditions (normal growth) and starvation (autophagy). The autophagy machinery is activated upon several stimuli, like nutrient starvation, infection, repair mechanism or in programmed cell death. The role of Atg1 and its regulation is best studied under nutrient starvation and the corresponding arrest of growth. A key enzyme in the signalling pathway of nutrient availability is TOR, of which two isoforms exist in yeast(Tor1 and Tor2). These proteins form two distinct complexes, termed TORC1 and TORC2 of which TORC1 is highly sensitive to cellular nutrient conditions. Under nutrient rich conditions, TORC1 is active and phosphorylates Atg13 at multiple sites, thereby inhibiting a complex formation with Atg1. This leads to a decrease in Atg1 kinase activity and decreased autophagy. Upon starvation, Atg13 is rapidly dephosphorylated and forms a complex with Atg1, thereby activating it, which leads to the subsequent assembly of the PAS through recruitment of other Atg proteins. Molecular mechanism of Atg1 complex regulation by phosphorylation of Atg13 through TOR kinase under nutrient rich conditions. In addition to TORC1, protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits autophagy through the phosphorylation of Atg1 and Atg13. PKA phosphorylates Atg1 at two distinct serine residues; these modifications were shown to be necessary for Atg1 to properly dissociate from the PAS. The downstream substrate of Atg1 kinase hasn't been described yet, and it is still a matter of debate as to whether Atg1 primarily acts on autophagy through its kinase activity or through a structural role during autophagic complex formation. It is possible that the kinase activity of Atg1 is critical to the magnitude of autophagy but not its initiation. At least, large-scale screens led to a candidate list of possible Atg1 substrates, including Atg8 and Atg18. In conclusion, Atg1 first has a structural or scaffolding function during the initial steps of PAS set up, which then is followed by a kinase-dependent phase, that contains protein dynamics at the PAS.  Homologues  There is much evidence indicating that Atg1 homologues from other, multicellular organisms are required for autophagy as well but Recent work however also showed that there are differences and additional functions compared to the yeast model.  Caenorhabditis elegans  The corresponding homologue to Atg1 in C. elegans is unc-51 (uncoordinated-51). Unc-51 also functions in proper axonal guidance and in neuronal development.  Drosophila melanogaster  The Atg1 homologue in D. melanogaster is also important in neural development and neuronal trafficking. Additionally there is a feed back mechanism to TOR, that can inhibit TOR function, which actually lies upstream of Atg1. Atg1 and Atg13 are always in one complex in 'D.melanogaster and vertebrates. In D.melanogaster, Atg13 gets phosphorylated in starvation, what is exactly the opposite as in the yeast model.  Vertebrates  There are until now five potential Atg1 orthologues in vertebrates. ULK1 and ULK2 (unc-51-like kinase) have been reported to have an additional function in neuronal development, e.g. outgrowth regulation of mouse neurons. ULK1 and 2 also show a negative feedback regulation to mTOR.

It is the only genus within the family Mitrastemonaceae. Mitrastemon species are root endoparasites, which grow on Fagaceae. It's also a non-photoysthetic plant that parasitizes other plants such as \\"Castonopsis sieboldii\\". The parasitic plant was first discovered by botanist Eizi Matuda during an expedition to Mt. Ovando in the state of Chiapas, Mexico (Matuda, 1947). The different species were originally named by a friend of Matuda, Yamamoto in 1925-1926. Mitrastemon yamamotoi is a protandrous plant. This means that flowers go through a male phase before transforming into their final female form. This sequential gender change is very common in the flowers of various plants, but also can be found in many different animals as well. The flowers of M. yamamotoi are very well-liked by a variety of insects ranging from wasps to flies and beetles. Among these insects, beetles are the best pollinators for this plant since their visit to the flower would pick up a large amount of pollen and they would pollinate from each of the flowers that they had already visited. The plant is endemic to tropical and subtropical forest regions such as Southeast Asia and Japan. Since this species of plant is not commonly found within the United States, many here do not realize which plants are endangered. According to an article written by Tommy Leung, \\"Parasitic plants are among the most endangered organisms on the planet for most of them we don't know just how endangered they might be. Like other parasites, they are deeply interconnected with the rest of the ecosystem. And while insects like wasps and cockroaches tend to get a bad rap from people, for some organisms, they are a vital lifeline.\\" It is important that people take the time to understand that animals are not the only living organisms in the world that are endangered and reaching extinction. Every living organism has its own purpose and is an addition to a working environment or ecosystem. Taxonomy The taxonomic placement of the Mitrastemon was unsure for a long time. Originally it was placed within the order Rafflesiales, together with other parasitic plants, but this order was long suspected to be actually polyphyletic. In 2004, the genus was found to be related to Ericales by comparing their mitochondrial DNA. Several orthographic variants of the name Mitrastemon exist, including Mitrastema and Mitrastemma. The correct taxonomic name is Mitrastemon, the use of which was proposed and justified in an article by Reveal and approved by the Nomenclature Committee for Vascular Plants in a subsequent article. The species has a cylindrical body ranging from 3 cm to 7 cm in height with a tuberous base. During an early developmental stage it appears an off white color however once drying out it becomes a dark brown color (Mir et al., 2016). Life Cycle The plant is spotted only during the winter season and it completes the whole life cycle from November to April. Mitrastemon is completely embedded within the tissues of its host, except during the reproduction stage when above ground parts emerge from host tissues. Truth is there is very little to know about the reproductive system. Flowering and fruiting period: The plant is seen only during the winter season and it completes the whole life cycle from November to April (Mir et al., 2016). Ecology Unlike other plants, the flowers of this organism change sex from male to female. Various insects are involved in pollination. Mitrastemon yamamotol is mainly pollinated by social wasps, but previously unnoticed pollination are also important, based on visitation frequency and pollen loads. There has been numerous of studies of the pollination that suggest that nocturnal visitors, such as crickets and cockroaches, contribute to geitonogamous pollination. Diurnal visitors like social wraps facilitate outcrossing. Distribution Mitrastemon yamamotoi is distributed in the tropical and subtropical forest of Southeast Asia and Japan. Mitrastemon matudae is distributed from Southern Mexico to Colombia. Species Two species are known. M. matudae is found in Central America, while M. yamamotoi is found in Southeast Asia and Japan.

Early years Brannagan attended high school at Assumption Catholic Secondary School in Burlington where in his 5th and final year in 2004, he led the Assumption Crusaders to the GHAC finals where they defeated St. Jean de Brebeuf in a thriller, with the final score 29-28. Trailing by 27 points with less than 8 minutes to play, Brannagan led Assumption's offense to an amazing comeback, taking the lead with under 2 minutes left to play. College career=2005 Brannagan began his university football career with the Queen's Golden Gaels in 2005 and quickly assumed the starting quarterback position. In a game against Wilfrid Laurier, he came off the bench in the fourth quarter and threw for 110 yards, earning the start the following week against York University. He threw for 341 yards in the team's win and never looked back, starting the final seven games of the season. He was named the OUA Rookie of the Year for the 2005 season after completing 115 passes out of 209 attempts for 1,860 yards to go along with 12 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.http://www.gogaelsgo.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1271 2006-2007 In 2006, Brannagan started all ten games for Queen's (including two playoff games), leading the team to a 4-4 record. He finished the season ranked third in the OUA with 1,744 passing yards and threw for 11 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.http://www.gogaelsgo.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1271 In 2007, Brannagan started eight regular season games and one playoff game, as the team finished with a 6-2 record. He showed great improvement this season, passing for 2,123 yards for 15 touchdowns and only six interceptions.http://www.gogaelsgo.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1271 He also played in the CIS East/West Bowl in Hamilton that year. 2008 Brannagan continued to improve for the 2008 season, as he completed 144 of 255 passes for 2,407 yards for a nation-leading 24 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.http://www.gogaelsgo.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1271 In a week six win versus the University of Ottawa, he passed Tommy Denison as Queen's all- time leading passer. He again started all eight regular season games compiling an undefeated record of 8-0 and first seed in the OUA playoffs. However, the Golden Gaels were defeated by the underdog Ottawa Gee-Gees in the second round of the playoffs. For his outstanding play, Brannagan was named to the CIS All- Canadian Second Team. 2009 While the team suffered their first loss in the last regular season game of 2009, it would be the last time Brannagan would lose a CIS football game. Brannagan started seven games in 2009, en route to the Golden Gaels' 7-1 regular season finish. During the season, he would become only the third CIS quarterback to throw for over 10,000 yards in a career, and finished second all-time behind Michael Faulds with 10,714 yards. He threw for career bests of 2,580 yards and a 62.14% completion percentage to go along with 15 touchdowns and just seven interceptions. In the post-season, Brannagan was named Yates Cup MVP after recording a 43-39 win over Michael Faulds and the Western Ontario Mustangs. He capped off his outstanding collegiate career with a 33-31 win over the Calgary Dinos in the Vanier Cup where he was again named MVP for the game.http://english.cis- sic.ca/championships/fball/2009-10/releases/20091128-vaniercup Heading into the final week of the 2009 regular season and despite having already missed a game due to injury, Brannagan led Western quarterback Michael Faulds by 164 career passing yards, and sat just 30 yards shorthttp://www.gogaelsgo.com/news/2009/10/24/FB_1024092240.aspx?path=football of the all-time CIS record of 10,455 yards which was set just one season earlier by former McGill quarterback Matt Connell.https://www.cfl.ca/article/mcgill-s-connell-sets-cis-pass-record However, Brannagan had a mediocre Week 8, completing 25 of 45 attempts for 289 yards and no touchdowns, while Faulds threw for an impressive 550 yards against the University of Toronto.http://www.gogaelsgo.com/news/2009/10/24/FB_1024092240.aspx?path=football Brannagan subsequently finished second on the all-time list with 10,714 yards, having been surpassed by Faulds, who finished with the record of 10,811 yards.

It was shown in theaters before Toy Story 3. and has been released to purchase on iTunes in the United States. Unlike most other Pixar shorts, the animation style combines 2D and 3D elements, and Up production designer Don Shank says it is \\"unlike anything Pixar has produced before\\". Plot Day & Night follows two characters, Day and Night. Inside Day is a day scene with a sun in the center, and inside Night is a night scene with a moon in the center. Whatever goes on inside of Day or Night expresses normal events that typically occur within a day or night, respectively, and these events often correspond with actions or emotions that Day or Night express or receive. For example, when Day is happy he will have a rainbow inside him, and when Night is happy he will have fireworks inside him. Day and Night meet and at first are uneasy about each other. They are dismissive of each other because each perceives the other as being different, and their prejudices result in a physical altercation between the two. However, as the characters discovers the many fascinating events that occur in each other, they learn to appreciate them, and learn to like one another. At the end of the film, the Sun descends in Day and rises in Night, so that when the Sun is at the same height above the horizon in each, both characters appear to be identical. As the Sun continues its course, Day becomes Night, and Night becomes Day. Production The short uses a novel effect of combining 2D and 3D animation. The outlines of both characters are hand drawn and animated in 2-D, while the scenes inside their silhouettes are rendered in 3D; the use of a masking technique allows the 2D characters to be windows into a 3D world inside them. The Day & Night is Pixar's second short film to be partially animated in 2D, after Your Friend the Rat. The voice used in the short is from Dr. Wayne Dyer and was taken from a lecture he gave in the 1970s. The director of the movie incorporated the ideas taken from Dyer's lecture to show that the unknown can be mysterious and beautiful, and need not be something to fear, which is echoed by a similar speech by Albert Einstein, who said, \\"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious\\". Pixar honored Dyer by providing him with a private screening of the film. The score was created by Oscar winning composer Michael Giacchino, who also created the score for The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Up, Cars 2, Inside Out, Coco and Incredibles 2 Reception=Critical reception The short has been critically acclaimed. The Wall Street Journal described Day & Night as a \\"sensationally original short\\", and said it \\"looks like nothing you've ever seen, and plays like a dream of glories to come\\".https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704289504575312602886439646 Antagony & Ecstasy gave the film 10/10, writing \\"Newton's ability to finesse a remarkably difficult conceptual hook into a supremely easy cartoon is proof enough that he has storytelling skills much the equal of anybody working at Pixar. Yet this is also, possibly, the least of the film's achievements: it is technically, formally, and thematically a work of great accomplishment, and merely being able to tell a weird story coherently is just cake at that point\\".http://antagonie.blogspot.com.au/2011/01/movies-i-missed-in-2010-hegel- for.html The Projection Booth rated the film 4.5 out of 5, writing \\"Still superior [to the feature film Toy Story 3] is the preceding short Day & Night (directed by Teddy Newton), a morally and politically charged look at our perception of reality (and each other) and easily the best of Pixar's shorts to date\\".http://projectionbooth.blogspot.com.au/2010/08/viewing-log-3.html Cinema Crazed said the short is \\"ultimately very evocative of the classic Warner and MGM animated experiments that appealed to all audiences and didn‚Äôt talk down to its respective theater going crowd\\".http://cinema- crazed.com/blog/2010/11/17/day-night-2010/ NOLA.com described it as an \\"artful snatch of 3-D whimsy\\".http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2010/06/pixars_new_animated_short_is_l.html Awards and nominations Day & Night was nominated for the Best Animated Short Film at the 83rd Annual Academy Awards.

He is known for his structure of benzene proposed in 1867. Life Claus was born in 1838 in Kassel, Germany. Starting from 1850, he studied medicine in Marburg and later chemistry at the University of Marburg, with Hermann Kolbe. After spending a short time at the University of Berlin, he worked with Friedrich W√∂hler at the University of G√∂ttingen. He received his PhD in 1862, and in the same year changed his position and started working at the University of Freiburg. He completed his habilitation in 1866 and became assistant professor in the following year. With the retirement of Lambert Heinrich von Babo, Claus succeeded him as full professor. He held that position until his retirement due to health problems in 1900. Clause died in Horheim near Wut√∂schingen in the same year. Work The structure of benzene proposed by Claus. Claus mostly worked in organic chemistry where his interests were very diverse and included alkaloids, aromatic substitution, oximes and theoretical considerations on the structure of organic molecules. Claus is best known for proposing a model of benzene molecule in 1867. In his model, the six carbon atoms of benzene form a hexagon with a hydrogen atom attached to every corner. To preserve valence 4 for carbons, the opposite corners of the hexagon are connected by single bonds.Claus, Adolph K.L. (1867) \\"Theoretische Betrachtungen und deren Anwendungen zur Systematik der organischen Chemie\\" (Theoretical considerations and their applications to the classification scheme of organic chemistry), Berichte √ºber die Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Freiburg im Breisgau (Reports of the Proceedings of the Scientific Society of Freiburg in Breisgau), 4 : 116-381. In the section Aromatischen Verbindungen (aromatic compounds), pp. 315-347, Claus presents Kekul√©'s hypothetical structure for benzene (p. 317), presents objections to it, presents an alternative geometry (p. 320), and concludes that his alternative is correct (p.326). See also figures on p. 354 or p. 379. It took years of research before the three postulated structures of benzene ‚Äì by Albert Ladenburg (1869), August Kekul√© 1865 and by Claus ‚Äì found their place in organic chemistry. Ladenburg's prismane and Claus' benzene were both proven to be wrong. While the prismane was synthesized in 1973, calculations showed that the synthesis of Claus' benzene is impossible. Claus synthesized and determined the structure of several isomers of oximes. He described the isomerism by differences in the bond structure of the molecules whereas several other scientists found it more convincing to describe the difference by the relatively new concept of stereochemistry. This scientific dispute lasted until his death in 1900.

Definition Let p_0 and p_1 two univariate polynomials. Suppose that they do not have a common root and the degree of p_0 is greater than the degree of p_1. The Sturm series is constructed by: : p_i := p_{i+1} q_{i+1} - p_{i+2} \\\\text{ for } i \\\\geq 0. This is almost the same algorithm as Euclid's but the remainder p_{i+2} has negative sign.

The series begins with two polynomials obtained by dividing P(\\\\imath \\\\mu) by \\\\imath ^k where \\\\imath represents the imaginary unit equal to \\\\sqrt{-1} and separate real and imaginary parts: : \\\\begin{align} p_0(\\\\mu) & := \\\\Re \\\\left(\\\\frac{P(\\\\imath \\\\mu)}{\\\\imath^k}\\\\right ) = a_0 \\\\mu^k - a_2 \\\\mu^{k-2} + a_4 \\\\mu^{k-4} \\\\pm \\\\cdots \\\\ p_1(\\\\mu) & := -\\\\Im \\\\left( \\\\frac{P(\\\\imath \\\\mu)}{\\\\imath^k}\\\\right)= a_1 \\\\mu^{k-1} - a_3 \\\\mu^{k-3} + a_5 \\\\mu^{k-5} \\\\pm \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} The remaining terms are defined with the above relation. Due to the special structure of these polynomials, they can be written in the form: : p_i(\\\\mu)= c_{i,0} \\\\mu^{k-i} + c_{i,1} \\\\mu^{k-i-2} + c_{i,2} \\\\mu^{k-i-4}+\\\\cdots In these notations, the quotient q_i is equal to (c_{i-1,0}/c_{i,0})\\\\mu which provides the condition c_{i,0} eq 0.

It is adjacent to Brookfield Place and the Conrad Hotel, the Verizon Building to the east across West Street, and diagonally opposite the World Trade Center. It is the only office building in Battery Park City north of Brookfield Place. The skyscraper was designed by Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, with Adamson Associates Architects, and was erected at the cost of $2.1 billion. The building received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) gold certification. Features The building features an environmentally friendly raised floor underfloor air system. Conditioned air for the occupants is provided by multiple environmental air towers located in the tenant space that deliver air into a raised access floor plenum. This underfloor air system provides users with the ability to control their own space temperature as well as improving the ventilation effectiveness.

Between the building and the Conrad New York hotel to its west is a covered pedestrian walkway, with a glass and metal canopy designed by Preston Scott Cohen. Construction Construction on the building's foundation began in 2005 and faced various problems before completion in late 2009. On December 14, 2007, a nylon sling on a crane failed, sending a 7-ton load to the ground. It crushed two trailers and severely crippled the legs of an architect inside. Work at the site was halted for several days for safety violations. New York City officials halted the project after another construction accident occurred on May 17, 2008. A piece of steel fell eighteen stories onto a neighboring baseball field that was in use by children, though no one was injured. The City issued a stop-work order and cited the general contractor, Tishman Construction, for five violations. Work resumed in the months thereafter. The first of 7,500 employees arrived in October 2009. The building occupies and features six large trading floors. Goldman Sachs headquarters were previously at 85 Broad Street, with its main trading floor at One New York Plaza. Financing Built in the area affected by the September 11 attacks, the project was awarded with $115 million in tax breaks and cash grants, as well as $1.65 billion in Liberty Bonds to help cover the building's $2.1 billion construction costs.

Pepin the Short (ruled 751‚Äì768), Charlemagne (r. 768‚Äì814) (co-ruler with his brother Carloman I until 771), and Louis the Pious (r. 814-840) had considerable influence in the selection and administration of popes. The \\"Donation of Pepin\\" (756) ratified a new period of papal rule in central Italy, which became known as the Papal States. This shift was initiated by the Lombards conquering the Exarchate of Ravenna from the Byzantines, strengthened by the Frankish triumph over the Lombards, and ended by the fragmentation of the Frankish Kingdom into West Francia, Middle Francia, and East Francia. Lothair I continued to rule Middle Francia which included much of the Italian peninsula, from 843 to 855. This period was \\"a critical time in Rome's transformation from ancient capital to powerful bishopric to new state capital.\\"Goodson, 2010, p. i. The period was characterized by \\"battles between Franks, Lombards and Romans for control of the Italian peninsula and of supreme authority within Christendom.\\"Goodson, 2010, p. 6. History=Pepin the Short Following the death of Zachary, the last culturally Greek pope, Stephen II (752-757) became the first pope to cross the Alps, in 752,Mircea Eliade. 1987. The Encyclopedia of religion, Volume 11. p. 176; Hans K√ºhner. 1958. Encyclopedia of the Papacy. p. 41; Fred Mayer. 1980. The Vatican. p. 226; Patrick Granfield. 1980. The Papacy in transition. p. 5. when he appealed in person for the aid of Pepin the Short upon his election, following the Lombard takeover of Ravenna in 751. The Lombards had extinguished the exarchate of Ravenna and turned their attention to the formerly Byzantine Duchy of Rome. Stephen II had asked Constantinople for help, but the Eastern Romans had their own problems, so he traveled all the way to the palatium at Quierzy, where the reluctant Frankish nobles finally gave their consent to a campaign in Lombardy. For his part, then and there, Pepin executed in writing a promise to convey to the Papacy certain territories that were going to be wrested from the Lombards. No actual document has been preserved, but later 8th century sources quote from it. Fulfilling his part, in Paris Stephen anointed him as King of the Franks in a lavish ceremony at the Basilica of St Denis, bestowing upon him the additional title of patricius Romanorum (Patrician of the Romans). The \\"Donation of Pepin\\" strengthened the claim of the popes to the de facto core of the Papal States, and thus the incentives for secular interference in papal selection.Baumgartner, 2003, p. 13. Stephen II's brother and successor was Pope Paul I (757-767). According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: :While Paul was with his dying brother at the Lateran, a party of the Romans gathered in the house of Archdeacon Theophylact in order to secure the latter's succession to the papal see. However, immediately after the burial of Stephen (died 26 April, 757), Paul was elected by a large majority, and received episcopal consecration on the twenty-ninth of May. Paul continued his predecessor's policy towards the Frankish king, Pepin, and thereby continued the papal supremacy over Rome and the districts of central Italy in opposition to the efforts of the Lombards and the Eastern Empire. The death of Paul I was followed by a bloody schism characterized by Toto, the dux of Nepi, and Pope Stephen III (768-772).Goodson, 2010, p. 13. Toto supported the claim of his layman brother, Antipope Constantine; a small group of Lombards also supported the rival claim of a monk named Philip. Toto invaded Rome. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"through the support of the brothers Charlemagne and Carloman, Kings of the Franks, Stephen was able to recover some territories from the Lombards.\\" However, the Lombard King Desiderius married his daughter to Charlemagne, and \\"in some mysterious manner effected the fall of the pope's chief ministers, Christopher and Sergius.\\" After Toto had his eyes gouged out and was imprisoned, Stephen III decreed that the entire Roman clergy had the right to elect the pope but restricted eligibility for election to the cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons (incidentally, the first use of the term \\"cardinals\\" to refer to the priests of the titular churches or the seven deacons); the cardinal-bishops, supporters of Toto, were excluded. The Roman laity quickly regained its role after Stephen III's decree, and maintained its participation until 1059. The \\"papal elections of the following decade were a series of battles between secular and ecclesiastical groups, entangled obliquely in larger Italian and Frankish politics.\\" Charlemagne (left) conquered the Lombard capital of Pavia during the reign of Pope Adrian I (right). Charlemagne Pope Adrian I (772-795) and Pope Leo III (795-816) were elected under the rules of Stephen III, but the latter was forced from Rome and sought the aid of Charlemagne.Baumgartner, 2003, p. 14. Under the rule of Adrian I, Charlemagne conquered Pavia, ending the Lombard kingdom \\"and the Papacy was forever delivered from its persistent and hereditary foe.\\" Adrian I played a pivotal role in the fall of Pavia, and scholars have long assumed that he consistently supported the Frankish efforts to destroy Lombard power; however, the actual situation might be more complicated.David S. Sefton. 1979. \\"Pope Hadrian I and the Fall of the Kingdom of the Lombards.\\" The Catholic Historical Review 65(2): 206-220. Charlemagne confirmed the election of Leo III, sending Angilbert, Abbot of St. Regnier, to Rome to carry to the new Pope admonitions about the proper filling of his office.Landone, Brown. 1917. Civilization: An Appreciation of the Victories of Scholarship, Science and Art. I. Squire. p. 102. Leo III was consecrated the day after his election, an unusual move perhaps intended to preempt any Frankish interference. Coronation of Louis the Pious Louis the Pious Pope Stephen IV (816-817) required the Romans to take an oath to Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, as their suzerain, and he sent notice of his election to him before traveling to France to crown Louis. Pope Paschal I (817-824) sent \\"several ambassadors in rapid succession\\" to Louis before receiving from him the Pactum Ludovicianum, confirming the Donation of Pepin. Louis the Pious depicted kneeling before Pope Paschal I in 822The illustration is from L'Histoire de France Populaire, 1876, by Henri Martin, a historian closely identified with the Third Republic's values and historical philosophy: see Charles Rearick, \\"Henri Martin: from druidic traditions to republican politics\\", Journal of Contemporary History 7.3 (1972:53-64 ) After two unanimous elections, Louis the Pious intervened in a bitterly disputed election in favor of Pope Eugene II (824-827). According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"the election of Eugene II was a triumph for the Franks\\" and Louis \\"accordingly sent his son Lothair to Rome to strengthen the Frankish influence.\\" The pope and emperor signed a concordat or constitution in 824. The papal subjects were made to swear fealty to Louis and Lothair and were not to \\"suffer the pope-elect to be consecrated save in the presence of the emperor's envoys.\\" This was approximately the status quo circa 769, reincorporating the lay Roman nobles (who continued to dominate the process for 200 years) and requiring the pope to swear loyalty to the Frankish ruler. The consecration of Pope Gregory IV (827-844) was delayed for six months to attain the assent of Louis. Gregory IV was the candidate of the \\"secular nobility of Rome who were then securing a preponderating influence in papal elections\\" and thus \\"the representatives in Rome of the Emperor Louis the Pious\\" required this delay. Because of this delay, Gregory IV could not begin to govern the church until March 828. The clergy and the nobles elected different candidates in 844. Because Pope Sergius II (844-847) was, \\"after a disputed election, consecrated without any reference to the Emperor Lothaire, the latter was indignant, and sent his son Louis with an army to examine into the validity of the election.\\" Only when \\"Sergius succeeded in pacifying Louis, whom he crowned king\\", did Lothair I side with Sergius II, the noble candidate. Aftermath A map of Middle Francia circa 840, also showing the Donation of Pepin Three years later Pope Leo IV (847-855) was consecrated, again without imperial approval, which would have been difficult in any case as the Carolingian Empire was in the process of breaking up. Lothair II of Lotharingia indeed failed to impose his own candidate, Pope Benedict III (855-858), in 855 until the Roman-elected candidate refused the office (the first recorded historical refusal).Baumgartner, 2003, p. 15. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: :On the death of Leo IV (17 July, 855) Benedict was chosen to succeed him, and envoys were dispatched to secure the ratification of the decree of election by the Emperors Lothaire and Louis II. But the legates betrayed their trust and allowed themselves to be influenced in favour of the ambitious and excommunicated Cardinal Anastasius. The imperial missi, gained over in turn by them, endeavoured to force Anastasius on the Roman Church. Lothair II was present for the election of Pope Nicholas I (858-867), who prohibited anyone outside of the Roman community from interfering in papal elections, and as a result Pope Adrian II (867-872) was consecrated without even informing the Franks. Lothair II's choice of Nicholas I was contrary to the wishes of the clergy, but \\"was confirmed without much ado\\" and Nicholas I was crowned in the emperor's presence.Duchesne, Louis. 1907. The Beginnings of the Temporal Sovereignty of the Popes: A. D. 754-1073. K. Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & co., ltd. p. 155. Raphael's The Battle of Ostia According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Adrian II \\"strove to maintain peace among the greedy and incompetent descendants of Charlemagne.\\" Pope Marinus I (882-884) was consecrated \\"without waiting for the consent of the incompetent emperor, Charles the Fat.\\" Pope Stephen V (885-891) was similarly consecrated, and Charles the Fat may have intervened had Stephen V not been elected unanimously. The coins of Pope Romanus (879) continued to bear the name of Emperor Lambert as well as his own monogram. A synod in Rome decided that Pope John IX (898-900) should not be consecrated except in the presence of \\"imperial envoys.\\" Legacy Raphael's The Coronation of Charlemagne, depicting Pope Leo III It was during the time of Charlemagne that it became customary for the pope to approve the creation of a new archdiocese and to determine its geographic extent.Luscombe and Riley-Smith, 2004, p. 11. These changes \\"made the archbishop seem more like the pope's deputy with a delegated share of the universal primacy.\\" Of course, powerful rulers continued to establish their own archdiocese‚Äîfor example, Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, created Magdeburg in 963, and Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, created Bamberg in 1020‚Äîand to strongly influence decisions nominally made by the pope. Pope Gregory IV (822-844) was unsuccessful in 830 when he attempted to side with Lothair I and his bishops against Louis the Pious. Disputes such as these lead to the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, a forgery of the ilk of the \\"Donation of Constantine.\\" The coronations of Pepin, Charlemagne, and Louis by popes planted the idea among generations of European rulers that the pope could confer legitimacy to the title of \\"emperor.\\"Luscombe and Riley-Smith, 2004, p. 13.

Mescalitan Island was a mesalike island located about 10 miles west of Santa Barbara near the outlet of the Goleta Slough into the Pacific Ocean. History=Chumash The island is where the Chumash Indian village Helo was centered. Early Spanish mission documents note that Juan Crespi, an early visitor, observed the island village to have at least 100 houses with about 600 to 800 total residents. Cabrillo The first European explorer in the Goleta area, Portuguese navigator Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, arrived on October 15, 1542. At this time the Goleta Slough was deep and wide enough to permit entry of large ships. A Spanish schooner, or 'goleta', reportedly sank in the lagoon area sometime thereafter. From that point on, the area became known as Goleta. During a sailing trip to Northern California Cabrillo was injured, later dying of his injuries; according to some accounts he was buried on San Miguel Island. However, according to the local canali√±os (Chumash) he was buried on Mescalitan Island. Mescalitan Island was a prominent landmark in the Goleta Slough area. In the 1860s, after years of flooding and winter storms the slough became filled in with sediment. Leveled In 1941 the Army Corps of Engineers leveled most of Mescalitan Island to provide fill for a Navy airport. That airport became part of Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara in 1942, and a few years later became the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.

School boards in Quebec had been organized along confessional lines, Catholic and Protestant, since before Canadian Confederation. In fact, Quebec was guaranteed a confessional public school system by the British North America Act, 1867, now known as the Constitution Act, 1867. The provincial government was therefore required to ask the federal government to amend the Canadian Constitution if it were to reorganize school boards along linguistic lines, English and French. The amendment was passed without much debate by both the House of Commons and the Senate, notwithstanding the unresolved constitutional debate between Quebec and the rest of Canada. The PSBGM held the 1996 PSBGM 150th Anniversary Logo Contest. Debra Shapiro-Lambersky, then a 6th grade student at the Willingdon School, designed the winning logo, showing a group of books surrounding a red heart.\\"The 150th anniversary of the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal.\\" Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal.

He was the founding editor of Stavanger Aftenblad and served as a member of the Storting. Background He was born in Stavanger as the son of teacher Svend Oftedahl (1812‚Äì83) and Gunhild Ommundsdatter Stokke (1809‚Äì81). His father was a teacher at Stavanger Cathedral School. His younger brother Sven Oftedal (1844‚Äì1911) was a Norwegian American Lutheran minister who served as the 3rd president of Augsburg University and helped found the Lutheran Free Church. Oftedal passed his examen artium in 1859 and entered Royal Frederick University in Christiania where he studied theology under Gisle Johnson (1822‚Äì1894). Oftedal graduated cand.theol. in 1864 and took theological exam in 1865. Career His first working position was as a traveling revivalist for Bergens Indremisjon. He was a seamen's priest in Cardiff from 1866 to 1868. From 1869 he worked for the home mission of the Arendal district. His collection of psalms, Basunr√∏st og Harpetoner from 1870 was met with great popularity and was printed in 200,000 copies over the years. In 1870 he was appointed priest in Kristiansands stift. From 1874 he was a priest in Hetland outside Stavanger. His own chapel Bethania in Stavanger opened in January 1875. He was a vicar in Stavanger from 1885 to 1891. Oftedal founded several social institutions in Stavanger, including an orphanage for boys in 1877, and a home for women (the Magdalena institution). He bought the Storhaug farm Berge, renamed Emmaus, which was included in the group of institutions. He acquired the island Lind√∏y, where he established an institution for the most difficult boys. The fundings for his charity work came from volunteer work, including large lotteries (\\"bazaar\\") in Bethania. The first Waisenhus bazaar was arranged in 1876, and became a tradition which lasted more than hundred years, until the 1980s. Oftedal edited the newspaper Vestlandsposten from 1878 to 1891. In 1893 he founded and edited the newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad. After Oftedal's death in 1900, his son Lars Oftedal took over as editor until his own death in 1932. He was followed by his son Christian Stephansen Oftedal who operated the newspaper until he died in 1955. Politician Oftedal was a deputy representative from Stavanger to the Parliament from 1877 to 1879. He was elected to the Stavanger City Council from 1881. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from 1883 to 1885, representing the Liberal Party, and from 1889 to 1891, when he represented the Moderate Liberal Party. In 1891 he was elected for the period 1892 to 1894, but did not meet due to the scandal in November 1891. After a service in his church, he witnessed that he had lived in \\"immorality\\" and sought leave from his position. He also voluntarily withdrew from his positions in the charity institutions and as editor of Vestlandsposten. Due to the Constitution's paragraph 63 he also did not meet at the Parliament. After the scandal he continued his ministry activities, becoming principal of a new prayer house in Stavanger. Oftedal was elected to the Stavanger City Council in 1898, but died in May 1900 in Stavanger. Personal life In 1889 he became a Knight of the Order of St. Olav. In 1865, he was married Olava Mathilde Olsen (1839‚Äì1931). He was the father of Lars Oftedal (1877‚Äì1932). His grandchildren included physician Sven Oftedal (1905‚Äì48) and newspaper editor Christian Oftedal (1907‚Äì55).

After the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on December 8, 1987, the Longhorn plant was used to destroy Pershing 1a and Pershing II missiles. The plant was operated by Thiokol.

Environment The Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant was listed as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List on August 30, 1990. The United States Environmental Protection Agency listed the primary contaminants of concern as solvents used at the site. Methylene chloride and trichloroethene were detected in the groundwater on the plant, but were only detected in limited amounts in streams flowing into Caddo Lake. The groundwater, surface water, and soil on the plant have been found to be contaminated with perchlorate. Sediment samples from streams near Caddo Lake found elevated levels of lead and mercury.

According to the show's producer Joe DeVito's Twitter account, it was a one time special and no new episodes will be aired. This first show premiered Wednesday, October 13, 2010 at 11:30 pm, ET/PT and showcased Margera, Dunn and O'Connor doing The Tough Guy Challenge in the Perton, Staffordshire, near Wolverhampton, England.

A few segments have also been used for The Jay Leno Show. * 99 Cent Shopping Spree: Leno shows off real items collected from a local 99 cent store, which have any assembly mistakes (hair combs in a bag labeled sun glasses), poorly translated words on directions or packaging, or if they are just tacky items. * Ask the Fruitcake Lady: Marie Rudisill, an outspoken older woman and aunt of Truman Capote, responded to questions about relationships, sex and family. She was originally on the show to promote her cookbook about fruitcake, hence the segment's name. This segment was discontinued in November 2006 upon Rudisill's death. *Ask Jay Anything: Jay asked the audience anything by answering questions. On the May 12, 2003 episode, there was a variant called \\"Ask Katie Anything (Cause Jay's Not Here)\\". * Beyondo - Leno would work with Kevin Eubanks on trying to summon people from the great beyond; green screen camera tricks used to make only Leno's head visible. * Celebrity Interviews: Leno will conduct an interview with a celebrity or recent major news name. The person in question is an obvious parody designed to utilize humorous responses. This often occurs \\"via satellite,\\" but the character's portions are done on the musical performance part of the stage. Fred Willard (as \\"Willard J. Fredericks\\") and Gilbert Gottfried are the most common actors used for the segment, as well as Steve Bridges impersonating George W. Bush. Another variation consists of \\"Phony Interviews,\\" an edited segment where Jay asks comedic questions on set, followed by the actual subject's response at a news conference or on a news interview show. * Celebrity Jeopardy: A Jeopardy! game that includes people in costumes portraying famous people in the news. George W. Bush, and Martha Stewart, are commonly portrayed. Gilbert Gottfried, who is always included on the panel, portrays other uncommon characters such as the Easter Bunny or Pontius Pilate, and is characterized by his frequent use of the phrase, \\"Son of a bitch!\\" at some point during the segment. * Comedic Products: Depending on the season, Leno will bring out comedic spins on gifts, media releases and \\"inventions that didn't work out.\\" (for example: A Day After Tomorrow home game for the summer months). It also came out in a different iteration, as being supposedly sold through the NBCCC (Nothing But Cheap Crap Channel), with Leno playing the channel's resident host, Bob Johnson. * Cop 'N Kitty: Leno portrays a police officer, with a kitten as his sidekick. Originated at The Jay Leno Show. * Dealing with the Public: Leno plays real police or 911 audio/video recordings that are ridiculous, stupid or funny, such as a man who called 911 and admitted that he was high after smoking marijuana and asked the operator the score of a Detroit Red Wings game. * Does this impress Ed Asner?: Individuals perform stunts or show off a talent in front of Ed Asner. Asner comments on whether or not the act impresses him. Similar to the former Late Show with David Letterman stunt, \\"Is This Anything?\\". * Does This Impress William Shatner?: Individuals perform stunts or show off a talent in front of William Shatner. Shatner comments on whether or not the act impresses him. Similar to the former Late Show with David Letterman stunt, \\"Is This Anything?\\". * Don't Try This at Home: Individuals perform stunts that are dangerous. As the segment's name suggests, the home and studio audience should not try these acts as the performers have trained themselves to do their stunts, and people who haven't would likely accidentally injure or kill themselves if they attempt it. The majority of the performers performing their talents in this segment are male, with very few appearing in the segment being female. * Duller Image Catalog: Leno will present outrageous and crude products created by the staff. A play on The Sharper Image Catalog. * Fake Spokesperson Auditions: People are asked to be a spokesperson for a TV ad. Each person is asked to read cue cards, or do strange things, as part of an advertisement for a fake product. At the end of the \\"ad\\", the person is asked to say \\"I'm on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno\\". * Headlines: Humorous print items sent in by viewers. These real-life headlines are usually headlines with typographical errors, or unintentionally inappropriate items. The segment usually starts out with a fake, humorous Headline during the introduction for the segment, such as Arabs Wish Bush \\"A Happy Shoe Year!\\", usually reflecting some current event. Reflecting Jay's moving of this segment to a 10 PM ET/PT time slot, the lead Headline on the final broadcasting of this segment was 4 Out Of 5 Scientists Say \\"Headlines\\" Funnier at 10PM Than 11:30PM. The segment is aired on Monday nights, unless the Monday episode (or the entire week's slate of episodes) is a repeat or if a segment featuring a Tonight Show correspondent at an event will air in its place, in which \\"Headlines\\" will air in the next new episode. *Hockey Player or Medication?: Leno shows the audience a word and the audience determines whether it is an NHL player's last name or a kind of medication. * Howie Mandel: Using a hidden camera, Howie would play practical jokes on average citizens. This bit became much less common after the beginning of Howie's program Deal or No Deal. * Iron Jay - pumping iron questions with a muscle headed Leno. His body was made to look bigger with mirrors and the camera. * Jaywalking: A pre-recorded segment, \\"Jaywalking\\" is a play on the host's name and the illegal practice of jaywalking. Up to 15 people are interviewed in an hour or less for each segment, with about nine interviews used on the air. Leno asks people questions about current news and other topics in public areas around Los Angeles (usually Hollywood Boulevard, Melrose Avenue or Universal Studios). Most responses are outrageously incorrect; for example, one person believed that Abraham Lincoln was the first president, and another could not identify a picture of Hillary Clinton. Sometimes the questions are of the \\"What color is the White House?\\" level, such as asking in what country the Panama Canal is located. (These are similar to questions featured on the syndicated comedy game show Street Smarts. Not only has Howard Stern stated that the segment was lifted directly from his radio show, but there is recorded proof that Stern did the bit long before Leno.) Some of the interviewees prove so popular with viewers that they become regulars on The Tonight Show itself. Such examples are Jaywalk All-Stars Kip and Kim, who have a recurring segment on the show entitled What would Kip and Kim Do?, where people in situations ask them for advice. Their responses are often ridiculous and done to make the audience laugh. Another frequent Jaywalking guest, Angela Ramos, quickly became popular (due to her nasally high-pitched laugh, similar to that of Fran Drescher) and joined the show for a time as a correspondent. Segments related or similar to \\"Jaywalking\\" include: ** Battle of the Jaywalk All-Stars: Some of the lowest-scoring \\"Jaywalkers\\" are brought back onto the show to be asked simple questions to see which one can score higher. According to Leno, he at first expected that contestants, after watching themselves on television, would study facts ahead of appearing on Jaywalk All-Stars. (Leno: \\"Not a problem!\\")The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, 29 May 2009. ** Steve the Judgmental Bastard: An entertaining riff on \\"Jaywalking\\" in which Steve Schirripa predicts how random people on the street will answer questions about themselves based on how they look. ** Tattoo or no tattoo?: Leno interviews a person followed by the audience guessing whether they have a tattoo. * Listen to Iman - Leno would let model Iman give advice to audience members. * Meal or No Meal: Three panelists watch a talent show consisting of three audience contestants. After each talent is displayed, the judges decide on whether it impresses them enough to give them a free meal at a local restaurant. * Midnight Confessions: Members of the audience tell a story about something in their life about which they are embarrassed. Often, at the end of the confession, a product appropriate for the situation is presented to the person (often by Gilbert Gottfried). * Mr. Brain - Leno acting as a brainiac, taking questions from the audience. His head was made to look bigger with mirrors and the camera. * Photo Booth: A real free photo booth is set up at Universal Studios Hollywood, and people inside are bothered and made fun of before getting their picture taken. The booth's voice is provided by comedian Kira Soltanovich. * Pitch To America: Whenever a screenwriters convention is held in the U.S., a Tonight Show camera crew sets up an area where screenwriters can walk up and make a pitch for a movie script or television show that he/she has been working on. More recently, the crew goes to a trade show, where inventors pitch their product, and the audience is asked if it \\"sold\\" or \\"not sold\\" (similar to the Stuff We Found on eBay segment). * Pumpcast News: A fake news anchor, played by Timothy Stack, displayed on a TV screen at a gas station harasses and bothers the customers pumping gas. * Pumpernickel Bread Special: A segment where Leno invites celebrity chefs, such as Martha Stewart, to share hilarious recipes. * Ross the Intern: Ross Mathews, an intern for the show, is sent to participate in special events. As part of a running gag, Leno started introducing Ross as his illegitimate son. * Sidewalking: A camera and microphone are set up in a public location (e.g., on the street, on a college campus), individuals step up to the microphone and perform whatever they desire. * Steve Irwin bringing in Snakes and Crocodiles. Discontinued due to Steve Irwin's death in 2006. * Stuff We Found on eBay: Leno brings up some of the oddest stuff that he has supposedly found while searching on eBay, and the studio audience must determine whether the object was sold or not. * Survey Says: People at the Third Street Promenade in Los Angeles are asked to take a survey for a gift certificate of a store. Cast members use the information the person provides on the survey (college, hometown, work, etc.) to pretend to know the target. * Teenage Wasteland: Teenagers perform a stunt or talent they possess. Similar to the Late Show with David Letterman stunts, \\"Audience Show and Tell\\" and \\"Stupid Human Tricks.\\" Most of the teenagers performing their talents in this segment are male, with few appearing in the segment being female. * The Audience Wants to Know: Selected audience members are chosen to ask Leno questions, and in response, Leno shows a video clip relating to the subject. *The Economy is Bad - During the Monologue, Leno tells a series of one-liners themed around the current state of the economy. He has acknowledged that the cadence is a tribute to Rodney Dangerfield, and a quick playing of Hooray for Hollywood follows each joke. * The Fine Print: At his desk Leno presents regular everyday products but when zoomed in to reveal the fine print there is a message telling what the product's real intentions are (example: a bag of chips that warns if you eat the product you will get fat). * The Worst- Selling Products on Amazon.com: Leno will show a best-selling book, DVD, or CD available at Amazon.com, and then show a totally fictitious, but similarly designed and humorously titled item that is supposedly a complete flop at Amazon. * They Walk Among Us: Leno presents images of celebrities and their supposed look-alikes, who were discreetly taped in Burbank. He says they were products of cloning experiments gone wrong. * Tonight Show phone in. Tapes of celebrity voices are played while Leno talks with them. * Truth in Labeling: Leno displays products whose names have been changed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are now renamed for their most common uses. For example, a United States one hundred-dollar bill called \\"gas money.\\" * Videos We Found on YouTube: A prototypical Leno segment where he shows amusing videos supposedly found on YouTube. However, the videos are not viewed on YouTube but video files instead. \\"Zoo Tube\\" features similar videos of animals. * Virtual Jay - Computer-generated animation of Leno. According to the skit, when Leno heated up a burrito with the foil still on it in the microwave while at his computer, it caused an electrical shock to come from the microwave to Leno to his computer, thus causing Leno to \\"travel\\" through the Internet. It usually involved gags to emphasize some of his recurring jokes at the time (e.g. \\"Virtual Jay\\" in a page with the picture of a desert and then realizing that he was in Dan Quayle's webpage during his failed 1996 run for president). * What's George Bush Doing Today?: Started after George W. Bush left office, shows what Bush (played by Steve Bridges) is doing since leaving political office. It features Bush doing things like playing Dance Dance Revolution, having a lightsaber duel with Dick Cheney, or dancing to \\"Dragostea din tei\\" (in a parody of the Internet meme Numa Numa). * Wheel of Consolation: In the final weeks of an American Idol season, the person voted off comes on The Tonight Show and is given a chance to spin the wheel of consolation, which contains three elaborate sounding prizes. The wheel is rigged to stop on a certain item, when the contestant receives a play off of the item won. For example, if the wheel stops on 'Breakfast with Royalty,' the Burger King mascot presents the contestant with a breakfast sandwich.

Polygonum amphibium) is a species of flowering plant in the knotweed family known by several common names, including longroot smartweed, water knotweed, water smartweed, and amphibious bistort. It is native to much of North America, Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa, and it is known elsewhere as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed. Distribution Persicaria amphibia grows in many types of wet habitat, such as ponds, streams, and marshes. It is a rhizomatous perennial herb which takes a variety of forms and is quite variable in morphology. It may be an aquatic plant, growing submerged or floating in water bodies, it may grow in muddy and wet areas which are periodically inundated, and it may grow in moist spots on land, such as in meadows. Dry-land and fully aquatic plants are sometimes considered different named varieties of the species. Description Persicaria amphibia produces a thick stem from its rhizome. The stem may creep, float, or grow erect, rooting at stem nodes that come in contact with moist substrate. Stems are known to reach 3 meters (10 feet) long in aquatic individuals. The stems are ribbed and may be hairless to quite hairy in texture.Persicaria amphibia. Flora of North America. Leaves are lance-shaped or take various other shapes and are borne on petioles. They may be over 30 centimeters (1 foot) in length. The inflorescence is a dense terminal cluster of many five-lobed pink flowers. Plants may have bisexual or unisexual flowers, with some plants bearing only male or only female flowers. The fruit is a shiny brown rounded achene around 3 millimeters (0.12 inches) long. Uses Various parts of this plant were used by several Native American groups as medicinal remedies and sometimes as food.Polygonum amphibium. Native American Ethnobotany.

Its name is abbreviated as EWHC for legal citation purposes. The High Court deals at first instance with all high value and high importance civil law (non-criminal) cases, and also has a supervisory jurisdiction over all subordinate courts and tribunals, with a few statutory exceptions. The High Court consists of three divisions: the Queen's Bench Division, the Chancery Division, and the Family Division. Their jurisdictions overlap in some cases, and cases started in one division may be transferred by court order to another where appropriate. The differences of procedure and practice between divisions are partly historical, derived from the separate courts which were merged into the single High Court by the 19th-century Judicature Acts, but are mainly driven by the usual nature of their work, for example, conflicting evidence of fact is quite commonly given in person in the Queen's Bench Division, but evidence by affidavit is more usual in the Chancery Division which is primarily concerned with points of law. Most High Court proceedings are heard by a single judge, but certain kinds of proceedings, especially in the Queen's Bench Division, are assigned to a divisional court, a bench of two or more judges. Exceptionally the court may sit with a jury, but in practice normally only in defamation cases or cases against the police. Litigants are normally represented by counsel but may be represented by solicitors qualified to hold a right of audience, or they may act in person. In principle, the High Court is bound by its own previous decisions, but there are conflicting authorities as to what extent this is so. Appeal from the High Court in civil matters normally lies to the Court of Appeal, and thence in cases of importance to the Supreme Court (the House of Lords before 2009); in some cases a \\"leapfrog\\" appeal may be made directly to the Supreme Court. In criminal matters appeals from the Queen's Bench Divisional Court are made directly to the Supreme Court. The High Court is based at the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in the City of Westminster, London. It has district registries across England and Wales and almost all High Court proceedings may be issued and heard at a district registry.  History  The High Court of Justice was established in 1875 by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. The Act merged eight existing English courts‚Äîthe Court of Chancery, the Court of Queen's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of Exchequer, the High Court of Admiralty, the Court of Probate, the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, and the London Court of Bankruptcy‚Äîinto a new Supreme Court of Judicature (now known as the Senior Courts of England and Wales). The new Supreme Court was divided into the Court of Appeal, which exercised appellate jurisdiction, and the High Court, which exercised original jurisdiction. Originally, the High Court consisted of five divisions‚Äîthe King‚Äôs Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, Chancery, and Probate, Divorce and Admiralty divisions. In 1880, the Common Pleas and Exchequer divisions were abolished, leaving three divisions. The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division was renamed to the Family Division by the Administration of Justice Act 1970, and its jurisdiction reorganised accordingly. Divisions The High Court is organised into three divisions: the Queen's Bench Division, the Chancery Division, and the Family Division.Williams, Smith (2010). p. 6. A list of hearings in the High Court's divisions is published daily.RCJ Daily court lists Queen's Bench Division The Queen's Bench Divisionor King's Bench Division when the monarch is malehas two roles. It hears a wide range of common law cases and also has special responsibility as a supervisory court. Until 2005, the head of the QBD was the Lord Chief Justice. The post of President of the Queen's Bench Division was created by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, leaving the Lord Chief Justice as President of the Courts of England and Wales, Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales and Head of Criminal Justice. Sir Igor Judge was the first person to hold this office, appointed in October 2005. The Queen's Bench Division has supervisory jurisdiction over inferior courts, and its Administrative Court is generally the appropriate legal forum where the validity (but, at least in principle, not the merits) of official decisions may be challenged. Generally, unless specific appeal processes are provided, the validity of any decision of a government minister, inferior court, tribunal, local authority or official body may be challenged by someone with sufficient interest by judicial review in the Administrative Court of the Queen's Bench Division. A single judge first decides whether the matter is fit to bring to the court (to filter out frivolous or unarguable cases) and if so the matter is allowed to go forward to a full judicial review hearing with one or more judges. In addition, the Queen's Bench Divisional Court hears appeals on points of law from magistrates' courts and from the Crown Court. These are known as appeals by way of case stated, since the questions of law are considered solely on the basis of the facts found and stated by the authority under review. Other specialised courts of the Queen's Bench Division include the Technology and Construction Court, Commercial Court, and the Admiralty Court. The specialised judges and procedures of these courts are tailored to their type of business, but they are not essentially different from any other court of the QBD. Appeals from the High Court in civil matters are made to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division); in criminal matters appeal from the Divisional Court is made only to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Chancery Division The Chancery Division (housed in the Rolls Building) deals with business law, trusts law, probate law, insolvency, and land law in relation to issues of equity. It has specialist courts (the Patents Court and the Companies Court) which deal with patents and registered designs and company law matters respectively. All tax appeals are assigned to the Chancery Division. The head of the Chancery Division was known as the Vice-Chancellor until October 2005, when the title was changed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 to Chancellor of the High Court. The first Chancellor (and the last Vice-Chancellor) was Sir Andrew Morritt, who retired in 2013 to be succeeded by Sir Terence Etherton. In 2016, Sir Geoffrey Vos succeeded Sir Terence as Chancellor on the latter's appointment as Master of the Rolls. Cases heard before the Chancery Division are reported in the Chancery Division law reports. In practice, there is some overlap of jurisdiction with the QBD. From October 2015, the Chancery Division and the Commercial Court (England and Wales) have maintained the Financial List for cases which would benefit from being heard by judges with suitable expertise and experience in the financial markets or which raise issues of general importance to the financial markets. The procedure was introduced to enable fast, efficient and high quality dispute resolution of claims related to the financial markets.Authorised Guide to the Financial List, 1 October 2015 =Business and Property Courts= The formation within the High Court of the Business and Property Courts of England & Wales was announced in March 2017,Judicial Office press release 12 March 2017 and launched in London in July 2017.Launch of Business and Property Courts, Judicial Office 4 July 2017 The courts would in future administer the specialist jurisdictions previously administered in the Queen's Bench Division under the names of the Admiralty Court, the Commercial Court, and the Technology and Construction Court, and in the Chancery Division under the lists for Business, Company and Insolvency, Competition, Financial, Intellectual Property, Revenue, and Trusts and Probate. The change was meant to enable judges who have suitable expertise and experience in the specialist business and property jurisdictions to be cross- deployed to sit in the specialist courts, while continuing existing practices for cases that proceed in them.Explanatory Statement issued by High Court 18 May 2017, p.2 Family Division The Family Division deals with personal human matters such as divorce, children, probate and medical treatment. Its decisions are often of great importance only to the parties, but may concern life and death and are perhaps inevitably regarded as controversial. For example, it permitted a hospital to separate conjoined twins without the parents' consent. In 2002 it made a landmark judgement in the case of Ms B v An NHS Hospital Trust regarding the right of mentally competent patients to withdraw from life saving treatment. The Family Division exercises jurisdiction to hear all cases relating to children's welfare, and has an exclusive jurisdiction in wardship cases. Its head is the President of the Family Division, currently Sir Andrew McFarlane. High Court Judges of the Family Division sit at the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London, while District Judges of the Family Division sit at First Avenue House, Holborn, London. The Family Division is comparatively modern. The Judicature Acts first combined the Court of Probate, the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes and the High Court of Admiralty into the then Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, or The Court of Wills, Wives & Wrecks, as it was informally called. That was renamed the Family Division in 1971 when the admiralty and contentious probate business were transferred elsewhere. The Family Division has faced criticism by allowing allegedly abusive partners to cross-examine their former partners; a procedure already banned in criminal procedure. Peter Kyle, MP for Hove, claimed this amounted to \\"abuse and brutalisation\\", and called for the system to be changed. Liz Truss, when she was Lord Chancellor, announced plans to end this practice, and proposals were contained in Clause 47 of the Prisons and Courts Bill before Parliament was prorogued for the 2017 General Election.Courts to ban cross-examination of victims by abusers Sittings The High Court only operates within four traditional periods in the year, known as sittings: :Michaelmas: 1 October to 21 December :Hilary: 11 January to the Wednesday before Easter :Easter: the second Tuesday after Easter to the Friday before the Spring bank holiday (last Monday in May) :Trinity: the second Tuesday after the spring holiday to 31 July Judges The Justices of Her Majesty's High Court of Justice are informally known as High Court judges, and in judicial matters are formally styled \\"The Honourable Mr(s) Justice (Forename) Surname\\", abbreviated in writing to \\"Surname J\\". In court, they are properly addressed as My Lord. Since by convention they are knighted upon appointment, socially they are addressed as Sir Forename or Dame Forename. High Court judges are sometimes referred to as red judges after the colour of their formal robes, in contrast to the junior circuit judges who are referred to as purple judges for the same reason. Masters (also judges in the High Court) are addressed as 'Master' regardless of gender and they wear dark blue gowns with pink tabs echoing the red of the High Court justices' robes. Within the Chancery Division of the High Court, there are also Insolvency and Companies Court judges, who hear the majority of High Court insolvency (both personal and corporate) and company law cases, together with some appeals from the County Court. They too wear dark blue gowns with pink tabs and are addressed as 'Judge' in court. Justices of the High Court, Insolvency and Companies Court judges and masters are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of Judicial Appointments Commission, from qualified lawyers. The Lord Chancellor, and all government ministers, are statutorily required to \\"uphold the continued independence of the judiciary\\",Section 3, Constitutional Reform Act 2005 https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/section/3 and both Houses of Parliament have standing orders to similar effect. High Court justices may be removed before their statutory retirement age only by a procedure requiring the approval of both Houses of Parliament. In addition to full High Court justices, other qualified persons such as retired judges, circuit judges from the County Court, and barristers are appointed to sit as deputy judges of the High Court to hear particular cases, and while sitting are addressed as though they were full High Court judges. Occasionally trials in London are conducted by masters, who have almost identical trial jurisdiction to full High Court judges but who do not hear committals to prison, criminal cases, or judicial review and do not travel 'on circuit' to outlying courts. High Court justices (usually from the Queen's Bench Division) also sit in the Crown Court, which try the more significant criminal cases, but High Court Judges only hear the most serious and important cases, with circuit judges and recorders hearing the majority. Circuits and district registries  Historically the ultimate source of all justice in England was the monarch. All judges sit in judgment on the monarch's behalf (hence they have the royal coat of arms displayed behind them) and criminal prosecutions are generally made in the monarch's name. Historically, local magnates administered justice in manorial courts and other ways. Inevitably, the justice administered was patchy and appeals were made direct to the monarch. The monarch's travelling representatives (whose primary purpose was tax collection) acted on behalf of the monarch to make the administration of justice more even. The tradition continues of judges travelling around the country in set 'circuits', where they hear cases in the 'district registries' of the High Court. The 'main' High Court (in the City of Westminster, London) is not itself a High Court district registry.partial support: UK Ministry Of Justice, Queen's Bench Division webpage, 'Outside London, the work of the Queen's Bench Division is administered in provincial offices known as District Registries. In London, the work is administered in the Central Office [of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court] at the Royal Courts of Justice.' (accessed 2014-Apr-17) The High Court previously divided England and Wales into six circuits namely the Midlands, Northern England, North Eastern England, South Eastern England, Wales (including Cheshire), and Western England.Legal systems in the UK (England and Wales): overview - The High Court Since 2005, the High Court has used seven circuits, listed below, which are identical to the Crown Court regions.The Judicial System of England and Wales: A visitor‚Äôs guide - What are Circuits? from the Judicial OfficeCourts and tribunals judiciary: Circuit judge *London, consisting of the Greater London region. *Midlands, consisting of the East Midlands and West Midlands regions, plus North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire. *North East England, consisting of the North East England and Yorkshire and the Humber regions, minus North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire. *North West England, consisting of the North West England region. *South East England, consisting of the East of England and South East England regions, minus Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. *South West England, consisting of the South West England region, plus Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. *Wales, consisting of all of Wales. Costs Office The Senior Courts Costs Office, which quantifies legal costs pursuant to orders for costs, serves all divisions. Such Costs Office is part of the High Court.UK Ministry Of Justice, CPR Part 47 Practice Direction 4.2(2)(c), 'the Costs Office as part of the High Court' (accessed 2014-Apr-18) Because the Costs Office is part of the High Court, generally all detailed assessment proceedings commenced in the Costs Office are subject to provisional assessment.UK Ministry Of Justice, Civil Procedure Rule 47.15(1) (accessed 2014-Apr-18) Exceptions from provisional assessment are detailed assessment proceedings in which the costs claimed are large (greater than ¬£75,000) or in which the potential paying party does not respond to the notice of assessment.

Early years He was born in 1908, one of seven children born to Ned Maley, a native of County Mayo and Anne Sherlock from Glasgow, and raised in Stevenson Street in the Calton district of Glasgow. He was sent to work as a boy to help support his family. Aged 11, he had been at the 'battle of George Square\\" or 'Bloody Friday' in 1919 when the police attacked a crowd of thousands of striking workers seeking a 40hour week.His neighborhood was considered a \\"hotbed of socialism\\" in the 1920s, which helped radicalize Maley politically, including the inspiring speaker at events at Glasgow Green, politician Jimmy Maxton which helped begin Maley's embrace of socialism, and, after 1932, communism. In 1929 and 1930, at the onset of the Great Depression, Maley lived in Cleveland, Ohio with relatives working in a factory, after his father died . The economic effects of the Depression caused him to return to his native Glasgow. In 1932, he joined the Communist Party and denounced fascism and \\"the inequalities and social injustice\\" in Britain at the time.Obituary in The Independent He too became a speaker at Glasgow Green. Spanish Civil war In 1936, Maley was one of 250 who gathered in Glasgow's George Square to join buses and head off to the fight in Spain after hearing La Pasionaria on the radio. Maley said it was like a Celtic supporters outing. There were around 35,000 International Brigades volunteers between 1936 and 1939, fighting for the Spanish Republic. He was in the No.2 Machine Gun Company when captured after hiding in olive groves for two days after the Battle of Jarama in February 1937 when General Francisco Franco's nationalists were rebuffed in Madrid. Maley recalled how unprepared and vulnerable the volunteer forces were: > After 200 yards going forward, the retreat was coming back and going down > past us and we were going through. There were soldiers running past us and > we were going up. And there were soldiers of the British Battalion dropping > as we were going up. Without firing a shot they were getting killed. Maley was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and held in Talavera de la Reina and Salamanca prisons. Prisoners were filed for newsreels, and Maley's mother (who had thought him dead) saw this in the local cinema and asked to keep the images. As a captured \\"foreigner\\", Maley would normally have been executed immediately. However, the edict was not carried out in the case of British prisoners of war. This was due in part to pressure from the British government citing the Geneva Convention, and, in part, thanks to Italian pressure for \\"swaps\\" of British POWs for Italian soldiers being held by the Spanish republican government.Obituary, ibid. Maley was finally released in a prisoner swap. At his mother's request, he did not return to Spain. World War II After Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, Maley joined the King's Own Scottish Borderers in 1941; serving in Burma and India. After he was demobbed, Maley worked for the next dozen years laying tracks for British Railways, and, afterwards, as a building labourer for the Glasgow Corporation. He remained politically active, especially as a trade unionist and tenants' association campaigner. Family He married Anne Watt in March 1948. They had nine children. Although he had been raised Catholic, Maley sent his nine children to non-denominational schools. He often borrowed books from the Book Exchange at Gilmorehill, giving his children a week to read them before taking them back in return for others.Obituary, ibid. The story of Maley's capture in Spain and the strange way that the family found out he was still alive inspired a play written by two of his sons, John and Willy, From the Calton to Catalonia. It was first performed in December 1990 in the Lithgow Theatre, Glasgow. Death James Maley died on 9 April 2007 in his native Glasgow from pneumonia, aged 99, survived by, in his immediate family, his wife, nine children and five grandchildren. His death was marked by his fellow Celtic Football Club fans, but many unaware of his story.

It was built in 1914 and became famous after racing an aircraft to New York City carrying newsreels of Charles Lindbergh's return to the United States after his transatlantic flight in 1927. In the late 1930s, No. 460 was operated by the Long Island Rail Road, and the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines in the early 1950s, before being retired in 1953. No. 460 is the only surviving locomotive of its class and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979. From 2010 to 2016, No. 460 underwent a restoration at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.  Background  An experimental Model E6 was developed in 1910 and, after two other \\"sample\\" locomotives and four years of tests, it was found that the 4-4-2 Atlantic's speed equaled that of the larger 4-6-2 Pacific's. An additional 80 E6 locomotives were ordered with superheaters and classified as the E6s.  History  No. 460 was the last of the E6s model to be built, out of a total of 80 locomotives. From their construction in 1914 until 1920, the E6s ran mostly on the corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C. After being replaced by the K4s model, the E6s locomotives were relegated to charter services because of their high speed. After returning from Europe and his transatlantic flight on June 11, 1927, Charles Lindbergh was promoted to colonel and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by President Calvin Coolidge. Two rival newsreel companies, who were each vying to be the first to have their films of the ceremony shown in New York theaters, chartered a train and an aircraft, respectively, from Washington to New York City. No. 460 headed up the charter train, pulling only its tender, a baggage car and a passenger car. The train departed Washington at 1:14 PM and arrived at the Manhattan Transfer, outside of New York City, 2 hours and 56 minutes later. The final leg, through the tunnels underneath the Hudson River, was completed by an electric DD1. No. 460 averaged and attained a maximum speed of . Even though the aircraft arrived in New York first, the film brought by No. 460 was in theaters hours before the other, thanks to a film processing lab on board the baggage car. After the race, No. 460 went back to its normal duties until March 1937, when it was loaned to the Long Island Rail Road. In January 1939, No. 460 was returned to the Pennsylvania, but was still occasionally used on Long Island as a \\"short term 'loaner'\\". Starting in 1942, it hauled trains between Camden and Bay Head, New Jersey. In 1951, parts were taken of other E6s locomotives that were going to be scrapped: the drivers on the engineer's (right) side are from PRR 1565, the air reservoir on the fireman's (left) side was from PRR 690 and the reservoir on the engineer's side was from PRR 782. 460's tender was replaced in 1952 with one from 1565; the original tender had been transferred to maintenance-of-way service. 460 was leased to the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines in 1953 before being retired in 1955 and added to the Pennsylvania's collection of historic locomotives in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.  Preservation  PRR 460 in 2010 before restoration No. 460 was moved from Northumberland in October 1969 to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. Although a part of the museum, it was not owned by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until it was officially donated to the museum in December 1979, by the Penn Central Transportation Company, which received ownership when the Pennsylvania was merged with the New York Central Railroad. No. 460 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979. From 1982 to 1984, volunteers at the museum cleaned the locomotive, replaced wooden window frames and doors, applied rust inhibitor primer and repainted the metal. The locomotive's boiler cladding was removed in 2008. 460 was moved into the museum restoration shops on March 17, 2010 after raising $50,000 and receiving an additional $50,000 donation. From July to August 2010, 460 was \\"blasted\\" to remove the several layers of lead paint from the locomotive. The blasting uncovered original timing marks and stamped numbers showing that the origins of some of the parts on 460 were cannibalized from other E6s locomotives. The cosmetic restoration of the 460 was completed in October 2016.

Born in Shropshire, he learned the trade of a mercer and draper. The Icks had five children when they emigrated to Otago in 1858. He worked in his learned trade in Dunedin for five years before becoming a farmer in Waikouaiti for seven years. In 1870, he came to Christchurch and set himself up as an auctioneer and later opened a drapery business. Early life Ick was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England in 1827. He was the only son of Joseph Ick, whose estate was known as Lady Halton. Ick married Jane Wainwright in 1849 and their children born in England were Stella, Hubert, Kate, Emily Jane, and Eliza Anne. The family emigrated to New Zealand on the Lord Worsley, arriving in Port Chalmers on 4 October 1858. They had further children in New Zealand. Professional life Ick was in business in Dunedin as a mercer and draper, with his premises in Princes Street. In January 1862, he announced that he would no longer provide credit to his customers, but would offer cash deals only, as that would reduce prices for consumers. He leased his business premises in December 1862 and held a clearance sale during January 1863. In 1863, he purchased a farm in Waikouaiti. Ick had a hunting accident in May 1867 where his own rifle discharged and shot him in the arm. He remained in Waikouaiti until 1870, first advertising his property for sale in April 1870. His stock and farm produce were auctioned on 26 May by Wright Stephenson. Moving to Christchurch, he was an auctioneer from 1870 to 1882, when he retired. At first, he was in partnership with Thomas Preece, who had come out to New Zealand on the same ship as Ick. The business arrangement was terminated in August 1872. His auction rooms were in High Street opposite the City Hotel. He leased business premises from George Gould in Whately Road, and set up a drapery shop in a building he named Bradford House near the Victoria Bridge. The business opened on 1 February 1874. Political career On 29 November 1862, Ick had a long advertisement in the Otago Daily Times about his inaugural election candidacy. He announced his political views for election to the High Ward of Dunedin's town board. The election was held on 1 December, but his name was not included amongst the candidates. In November 1863, Ick received a requisition asking him to stand in the Bell Ward for the town board. Of five candidates, Ick came fourth and was thus unsuccessful. In 1865, Ick was on the committee that secured the election of Thomas Dick as Superintendent of Otago Province. While in Otago, Ick was chairman for five years in total of two road boards. He was on a town council, and chaired a district school committee. Ick resigned from those posts when he moved to Christchurch. In September 1872, Ick received a numerously-signed requisition, requesting that he would stand for election to Christchurch City Council, to which he consented. Before 1916, elections for Christchurch City Council were held annually. Ick was elected onto the city council five times: in 1872, 1874, 1877, 1879 and 1880. The mayor was for the first time elected by voters on 20 December 1876; until the previous year, the mayor was chosen from amongst the city councillors, and they usually elected the most senior councillor. The 20 December 1876 mayoral election was contested by James Gapes and Ick, with Gapes representing working class interests, whereas Ick represented the wealthier part of the population. Gapes and Ick received 680 and 515 votes, respectively, and Gapes was thus declared elected. Ick next stood for election as mayor two years later in 1878, challenging the incumbent, Henry Thomson. Ick defeated Thomson by 601 votes to 343 and was installed on 18 December of that year. Ick won the 1879 mayoral election against Aaron Ayers and Gapes. Ick did not stand again in 1880, and his successor, James Gapes, was installed on 15 December. Death and commemoration He died on 27 April 1885, aged 58, at his residence in Papanui Road and is buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. His funeral was well- attended, with the current mayor, Charles Hulbert, and former mayors James Gapes, Henry Thomson, and George Ruddenklau as pallbearers. Halton Street in Papanui is named after his father's estate.

Expansion of early modern humans from Africa through the Near East Map of the migration of modern humans out of Africa, based on mitochondrial DNA. Colored rings indicate thousand years before present. In paleoanthropology, the recent African origin of modern humans, also called the \\"Out of Africa\\" theory (OOA), recent single-origin hypothesis (RSOH), replacement hypothesis, or recent African origin model (RAO), is the dominant model of the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). It follows the early expansions of hominins out of Africa, accomplished by Homo erectus and then Homo neanderthalensis. The model proposes a \\"single origin\\" of Homo sapiens in the taxonomic sense, precluding parallel evolution of traits considered anatomically modern in other regions, but not precluding multiple admixture between H. sapiens and archaic humans in Europe and Asia. H. sapiens most likely developed in the Horn of Africa between 300,000 and 200,000 years ago. The \\"recent African origin\\" model proposes that all modern non-African populations are substantially descended from populations of H. sapiens that left Africa after that time. There were at least several \\"out-of-Africa\\" dispersals of modern humans, possibly beginning as early as 270,000 years ago, including 215,000 years ago to at least Greece, and certainly via northern Africa about 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. These early waves appear to have mostly died out or retreated by 80,000 years ago.. See also Modern humans in China ~80,000 years ago (?), Dieneks' Anthropology Blog. The most significant \\"recent\\" wave took place about 70,000‚Äì50,000 years ago, via the so-called \\"Southern Route\\", spreading rapidly along the coast of Asia and reaching Australia by around 65,000‚Äì50,000 years ago, (though some researchers question the earlier Australian dates and place the arrival of humans there at 50,000 years ago at earliest, while others have suggested that these first settlers of Australia may represent an older wave before the more significant out of Africa migration and thus not necessarily be ancestral to the region's later inhabitants) while Europe was populated by an early offshoot which settled the Near East and Europe less than 55,000 years ago... See also mtDNA from 55 hunter-gatherers across 35,000 years in Europe, Dienekes' Anthroplogy Bog. In the 2010s, studies in population genetics uncovered evidence of interbreeding that occurred between H. sapiens and archaic humans in Eurasia, Oceania and Africa, indicating that modern population groups, while mostly derived from early H. sapiens, are to a lesser extent also descended from regional variants of archaic humans.

Omo-Kibish I (Omo I) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeleton currently known (196 ¬± 5 ka). Since the beginning of the 21st century, the picture of \\"recent single-origin\\" migrations has become significantly more complex, not only due to the discovery of modern-archaic admixture but also due to the increasing evidence that the \\"recent out-of-Africa\\" migration took place in a number of waves spread over a long time period. As of 2010, there were two main accepted dispersal routes for the out-of-Africa migration of early anatomically modern humans: via the \\"Northern Route\\" (via Nile Valley and Sinai) and the \\"Southern Route\\" via the Bab al Mandab strait. * Posth et al. (2017) suggest that early Homo sapiens, or \\"another species in Africa closely related to us,\\" might have first migrated out of Africa around 270,000 years ago.; see also . * Finds at Misliya cave, which include a partial jawbone with eight teeth, have been dated to around 185,000 years ago. Layers dating from between 250,000 and 140,000 years ago in the same cave contained tools of the Levallois type which could put the date of the first migration even earlier if the tools can be associated with the modern human jawbone finds. * An Eastward Dispersal from Northeast Africa to Arabia 150,000‚Äì130,000 years ago based on the finds at Jebel Faya dated to 127,000 years ago (discovered in 2011). Possibly related to this wave are the finds from Zhirendong cave, Southern China, dated to more than 100,000 years ago. Other evidence of modern human presence in China has been dated to 80,000 years ago. * The most significant dispersal took place around 50‚Äì70,000 years ago via the so-called Southern Route, either before or after the Toba event, which happened between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago. This dispersal followed the southern coastline of Asia, and reached Australia around 65,000-50,000 years ago, or according to some research, by 50,000 years ago at earliest. Western Asia was \\"re-occupied\\" by a different derivation from this wave around 50,000 years ago, and Europe was populated from Western Asia beginning around 43,000 years ago. * describes an additional wave of migration after the southern coastal route, namely a northern migration into Europe at circa 45,000 years ago. However, this possibility is ruled out by and , who argue for a single coastal dispersal, with an early offshoot into Europe. Northern Route dispersal Anatomically Modern Humans known archaeological remains in Europe and Africa, directly dated, calibrated carbon dates as of 2013. Beginning 135,000 years ago, tropical Africa experienced megadroughts which drove humans from the land and towards the sea shores, and forced them to cross over to other continents. Modern humans crossed the Straits of Bab el Mandeb in the southern Red Sea, and moved along the green coastlines around Arabia, and thence to the rest of Eurasia. Fossils of early Homo sapiens were found in Qafzeh cave in Israel and have been dated 80,000 to 100,000 years ago. These humans seem to have either become extinct or retreated back to Africa 70,000 to 80,000 years ago, possibly replaced by southbound Neanderthals escaping the colder regions of ice-age Europe. Hua Liu et al. analyzed autosomal microsatellite markers dating to about 56,000 years ago. They interpret the paleontological fossil as an isolated early offshoot that retracted back to Africa. The discovery of stone tools in the United Arab Emirates in 2011 at the Faya-1 site in Mleiha, Sharjah, indicated the presence of modern humans at least 125,000 years ago, leading to a resurgence of the \\"long-neglected\\" North African route. In Oman, a site was discovered by Bien Joven in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools belonging to the late Nubian Complex, known previously only from archaeological excavations in the Sudan. Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates placed the Arabian Nubian Complex at approximately 106,000 years old. This provides evidence for a distinct Stone Age technocomplex in southern Arabia, around the earlier part of the Marine Isotope Stage 5. According to Kuhlwilm and his co-authors, Neanderthals contributed genetically to modern humans then living outside of Africa around 100,000 years ago: humans which had already split off from other modern humans around 200,000 years ago, and this early wave of modern humans outside Africa also contributed genetically to the Altai Neanderthals.. See also Ancestors of Eastern Neandertals admixed with modern humans 100 thousand years ago, Dienekes'Anthropology Blog. They found that \\"the ancestors of Neanderthals from the Altai Mountains and early modern humans met and interbred, possibly in the Near East, many thousands of years earlier than previously thought\\". According to co-author Ilan Gronau, \\"This actually complements archaeological evidence of the presence of early modern humans out of Africa around and before 100,000 years ago by providing the first genetic evidence of such populations.\\" Similar genetic admixture events have been noted in other regions as well. In China, the Liujiang man () is among the earliest modern humans found in East Asia. The date most commonly attributed to the remains is 67,000 years ago. High rates of variability yielded by various dating techniques carried out by different researchers place the most widely accepted range of dates with 67,000 BP as a minimum, but do not rule out dates as old as 159,000 BP. claim that modern human teeth have been found in China dating to at least 80,000 years ago. Southern Route dispersal=Coastal route Red Sea crossing By some 50-70,000 years ago, a subset of the bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup L3 migrated from East Africa into the Near East. It has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in Africa, only a small group, possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people, crossed the Red Sea. The group that crossed the Red Sea travelled along the coastal route around Arabia and the Persian Plateau to India, which appears to have been the first major settling point. argued for the route along the southern coastline of Asia, across about , reaching Australia by around 50,000 years ago. Today at the Bab-el-Mandeb straits, the Red Sea is about wide, but 50,000 years ago sea levels were lower (owing to glaciation) and the water was much narrower. Though the straits were never completely closed, they were narrow enough to have enabled crossing using simple rafts, and there may have been islands in between. Shell middens 125,000 years old have been found in Eritrea, indicating the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by beachcombing. The dating of the Southern Dispersal is a matter of dispute. It may have happened either pre- or post-Toba, a catastrophic volcanic eruption that took place between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago at the site of present-day Lake Toba. Stone tools discovered below the layers of ash disposed in India may point to a pre-Toba dispersal but the source of the tools is disputed. An indication for post-Toba is haplo-group L3, that originated before the dispersal of humans out of Africa and can be dated to 60,000‚Äì70,000 years ago, \\"suggesting that humanity left Africa a few thousand years after Toba\\". Some research showing slower than expected genetic mutations in human DNA was published in 2012, indicating a revised dating for the migration to between 90,000 and 130,000 years ago. Some more recent research suggests a migration out-of-Africa of around 50,000-65,000 years ago of the ancestors of modern non-African populations, similar to most previous estimates. Western Asia A fossil of a modern human dated to 54,700 years ago was found in Manot Cave in Israel, named Manot 1, See also 55,000-Year-Old Skull Fossil Sheds New Light on Human Migration out of Africa, Science News. though the dating was questioned by . South Asia and Australia It is thought that Australia was inhabited around 65,000‚Äì50,000 years ago. As of 2017, the earliest evidence of humans in Australia is at least 65,000 years old, while McChesney stated that Fossils from Lake Mungo, Australia, have been dated to about 42,000 years ago. Other fossils from a site called Madjedbebe have been dated to at least 65,000 years ago., though some researchers doubt this early estimate and date the Madjedbebe fossils at about 50,000 years ago at the oldest. East Asia Tianyuan man from China has a probable date range between 38,000 and 42,000 years ago, while Liujiang man from the same region has a probable date range between 67,000 and 159,000 years ago. According to 2013 DNA tests, Tianyuan man is related \\"to many present-day Asians and Native Americans\\". Tianyuan is similar in morphology to Minatogawa Man, modern humans dated between 17,000 and 19,000 years ago and found on Okinawa Island, Japan. Europe According to , an early offshoot from the southern dispersal with haplogroup N followed the Nile from East Africa, heading northwards and crossing into Asia through the Sinai. This group then branched, some moving into Europe and others heading east into Asia. This hypothesis is supported by the relatively late date of the arrival of modern humans in Europe as well as by archaeological and DNA evidence. Based on an analysis of 55 human mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) of hunter-gatherers, argue for a \\"rapid single dispersal of all non-Africans less than 55,000 years ago.\\" Genetic reconstruction= Mitochondrial haplogroups Within Africa= mitochondrial population genetics (see: Haplogroup L). The first lineage to branch off from Mitochondrial Eve was L0. This haplogroup is found in high proportions among the San of Southern Africa and the Sandawe of East Africa. It is also found among the Mbuti people. These groups branched off early in human history and have remained relatively genetically isolated since then. Haplogroups L1, L2 and L3 are descendants of L1‚ÄìL6, and are largely confined to Africa. The macro haplogroups M and N, which are the lineages of the rest of the world outside Africa, descend from L3. L3 is about 70,000 years old, while haplogroups M and N are about 65-55,000 years old. The relationship between such gene trees and demographic history is still debated when applied to dispersals. Of all the lineages present in Africa, only the female descendants of one lineage, mtDNA haplogroup L3, are found outside Africa. If there had been several migrations, one would expect descendants of more than one lineage to be found. L3's female descendants, the M and N haplogroup lineages, are found in very low frequencies in Africa (although haplogroup M1 populations are very ancient and diversified in North and North-east Africa) and appear to be more recent arrivals. A possible explanation is that these mutations occurred in East Africa shortly before the exodus and became the dominant haplogroups thereafter by means of the founder effect. Alternatively, the mutations may have arisen shortly afterwards. =Southern Route and haplogroups M and N= Results from mtDNA collected from aboriginal Malaysians called Orang Asli indicate that the hapologroups M and N share characteristics with original African groups from approximately 85,000 years ago, and share characteristics with sub-haplogroups found in coastal south- east Asian regions, such as Australasia, the Indian subcontinent and throughout continental Asia, which had dispersed and separated from their African progenitor approximately 65,000 years ago. This southern coastal dispersal would have occurred before the dispersal through the Levant approximately 45,000 years ago. This hypothesis attempts to explain why haplogroup N is predominant in Europe and why haplogroup M is absent in Europe. Evidence of the coastal migration is thought to have been destroyed by the rise in sea levels during the Holocene epoch. Alternatively, a small European founder population that had expressed haplogroup M and N at first, could have lost haplogroup M through random genetic drift resulting from a bottleneck (i.e. a founder effect). The group that crossed the Red Sea travelled along the coastal route around Arabia and Persia until reaching India. Haplogroup M is found in high frequencies along the southern coastal regions of Pakistan and India and it has the greatest diversity in India, indicating that it is here where the mutation may have occurred. Sixty percent of the Indian population belong to Haplogroup M. The indigenous people of the Andaman Islands also belong to the M lineage. The Andamanese are thought to be offshoots of some of the earliest inhabitants in Asia because of their long isolation from the mainland. They are evidence of the coastal route of early settlers that extends from India to Thailand and Indonesia all the way to eastern New Guinea. Since M is found in high frequencies in highlanders from New Guinea and the Andamanese and New Guineans have dark skin and Afro- textured hair, some scientists think they are all part of the same wave of migrants who departed across the Red Sea ~60,000 years ago in the Great Coastal Migration. The proportion of haplogroup M increases eastwards from Arabia to India; in eastern India, M outnumbers N by a ratio of 3:1. Crossing into Southeast Asia, haplogroup N (mostly in the form of derivatives of its R subclade) reappears as the predominant lineage. M is predominant in East Asia, but amongst Indigenous Australians, N is the more common lineage. This haphazard distribution of Haplogroup N from Europe to Australia can be explained by founder effects and population bottlenecks. Autosomal DNA A 2002 study of African, European and Asian populations, found greater genetic diversity among Africans than among Eurasians, and that genetic diversity among Eurasians is largely a subset of that among Africans, supporting the out of Africa model. A large study by Coop et al. (2009) found evidence for natural selection in autosomal DNA outside of Africa. The study distinguishes non-African sweeps (notably KITLG variants associated with skin color), West- Eurasian sweeps (SLC24A5) and East-Asian sweeps (MC1R, relevant to skin color). Based on this evidence, the study concluded that human populations encountered novel selective pressures as they expanded out of Africa.; summary in Kliman (ed.), Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Biology (2016), p. 451 MC1R and its relation to skin color had already been discussed by . According to this study, Papua New Guineans continued to be exposed to selection for dark skin color so that, although these groups are distinct from Africans in other places, the allele for dark skin color shared by contemporary Africans, Andamanese and New Guineans is an archaism. suggest convergent evolution. A 2014 study by Gurdasani et al. indicates that the higher genetic diversity in Africa was further increased in some regions by relatively recent Eurasian migrations affecting parts of Africa. Pathogen DNA Another promising route towards reconstructing human genetic genealogy is via the JC virus (JCV), a type of human polyomavirus which is carried by 70‚Äì90 percent of humans and which is usually transmitted vertically, from parents to offspring, suggesting codivergence with human populations. For this reason, JCV has been used as a genetic marker for human evolution and migration. This method does not appear to be reliable for the migration out of Africa, in contrast to human genetics, JCV strains associated with African populations are not basal. From this conclude that either a basal African strain of JCV has become extinct or that the original infection with JCV post-dates the migration from Africa. Admixture of archaic and modern humans Evidence for archaic human species (descended from Homo heidelbergensis) having interbred with modern humans outside of Africa, was discovered in the 2010s. This concerns primarily Neanderthal admixture in all modern populations except for Sub- Saharan Africans but evidence has also been presented for Denisova hominin admixture in Australasia (i.e. in Melanesians, Aboriginal Australians and some Negritos). The rate of admixture of Neanderthal admixture to European and Asian populations as of 2017 has been estimated at between about 2‚Äì3%.East Asians 2.3‚Äì2.6%, Western Eurasians 1.8‚Äì2.4% () Archaic admixture in some Sub- Saharan African populations hunter-gatherer groups (Biaka Pygmies and San), derived from archaic hominins that broke away from the modern human lineage around 700,000 years, was discovered in 2011. The rate of admixture was estimated at around 2%. Admixture from archaic hominins of still earlier divergence times, estimated at 1.2 to 1.3 million years ago, was found in Pygmies, Hadza and five Sandawe in 2012. From an analysis of Mucin 7, a highly divergent haplotype that has an estimated coalescence time with other variants around 4.5 million years BP and is specific to African populations is inferred to have been derived from interbreeding between African modern and archaic humans. Stone tools In addition to genetic analysis, Petraglia et al. also examines the small stone tools (microlithic materials) from the Indian subcontinent and explains the expansion of population based on the reconstruction of paleoenvironment. He proposed that the stone tools could be dated to 35 ka in South Asia, and the new technology might be influenced by environmental change and population pressure. History of the theory=Classical paleoanthropology The frontispiece to Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature (1863): the image compares the skeleton of a human to other apes. The cladistic relationship of humans with the African apes was suggested by Charles Darwin after studying the behaviour of African apes, one of which was displayed at the London Zoo. The anatomist Thomas Huxley had also supported the hypothesis and suggested that African apes have a close evolutionary relationship with humans. These views were opposed by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, who was a proponent of the Out of Asia theory. Haeckel argued that humans were more closely related to the primates of South- east Asia and rejected Darwin's African hypothesis. In the Descent of Man, Darwin speculated that humans had descended from apes, which still had small brains but walked upright, freeing their hands for uses which favoured intelligence; he thought such apes were African: In 1871, there were hardly any human fossils of ancient hominins available. Almost fifty years later, Darwin's speculation was supported when anthropologists began finding fossils of ancient small-brained hominins in several areas of Africa (list of hominina fossils). The hypothesis of recent (as opposed to archaic) African origin developed in the 20th century. The \\"Recent African origin\\" of modern humans means \\"single origin\\" (monogenism) and has been used in various contexts as an antonym to polygenism. The debate in anthropology had swung in favour of monogenism by the mid-20th century. Isolated proponents of polygenism held forth in the mid-20th century, such as Carleton Coon, who thought as late as 1962 that H. sapiens arose five times from H. erectus in five places. Multiregional origin hypothesis The historical alternative to the recent origin model is the multiregional origin of modern humans, initially proposed by Milford Wolpoff in the 1980s. This view proposes that the derivation of anatomically modern human populations from H. erectus at the beginning of the Pleistocene 1.8 million years BP, has taken place within a continuous world population. The hypothesis necessarily rejects the assumption of an infertility barrier between ancient Eurasian and African populations of Homo. The hypothesis was controversially debated during the late 1980s and the 1990s. The now-current terminology of \\"recent-origin\\" and \\"Out of Africa\\" became current in the context of this debate in the 1990s. Originally seen as an antithetical alternative to the recent origin model, the multiregional hypothesis in its original \\"strong\\" form is obsolete, while its various modified weaker variants have become variants of a view of \\"recent origin\\" combined with archaic admixture. Stringer (2014) distinguishes the original or \\"classic\\" Multiregional model as having existed from 1984 (its formulation) until 2003, to a \\"weak\\" post-2003 variant that has \\"shifted close to that of the Assimilation Model\\". Mitochondrial analyses In the 1980s, Allan Wilson together with Rebecca L. Cann and Mark Stoneking worked on genetic dating of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor of modern human populations (dubbed \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\"). To identify informative genetic markers for tracking human evolutionary history, Wilson concentrated on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), passed from mother to child. This DNA material mutates quickly, making it easy to plot changes over relatively short times. With his discovery that human mtDNA is genetically much less diverse than chimpanzee mtDNA, Wilson concluded that modern human populations had diverged recently from a single population while older human species such as Neanderthals and Homo erectus had become extinct. With the advent of archaeogenetics in the 1990s, the dating of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups became possible with some confidence. By 1999, estimates ranged around 150,000 years for the mt-MRCA and 60,000 to 70,000 years for the migration out of Africa. \\"evidence that our species arose in Africa about 150 000 years before present (YBP), migrated out of Africa into Asia about 60 000 to 70 000 YBP and into Europe about 40 000 to 50 000 YBP, and migrated from Asia and possibly Europe to the Americas about 20 000 to 30 000 YBP.\\" From 2000‚Äì2003, there was controversy about the mitochondrial DNA of \\"Mungo Man 3\\" (LM3) and its possible bearing on the multiregional hypothesis. LM3 was found to have more than the expected number of sequence differences when compared to modern human DNA (CRS). Comparison of the mitochondrial DNA with that of ancient and modern aborigines, led to the conclusion that Mungo Man fell outside the range of genetic variation seen in Aboriginal Australians and was used to support the multiregional origin hypothesis. A reanalysis on LM3 and other ancient specimens from the area published in 2016, showed it to be akin to modern Aboriginal Australian sequences, inconsistent with the results of the earlier study. Y-Chromosome analyses  As current estimates on The male most recent common ancestor (\\"Y-chromosomal Adam\\" or Y-MRCA) converge with estimates for the age of anatomically modern humans and well predate the Out of Africa migration, geographical origin hypotheses continue to be limited to the African continent. The most basal lineages have been detected in West, Northwest and Central Africa, suggesting plausibility for the Y-MRCA living in the general region of \\"Central-Northwest Africa\\". another study finds a plausible placement in \\"the north-western quadrant of the African continent\\" for the emergence of the A1b haplogroup. The 2013 report of haplogroup A00 found among the Mbo people of western present-day Cameroon is also compatible with this picture. The revision of Y-chromosomal phylogeny since 2011 has affected estimates for the likely geographical origin of Y-MRCA as well as estimates on time depth. By the same reasoning, future discovery of presently- unknown archaic haplogroups in living people would again lead to such revisions. In particular, the possible presence of between 1% and 4% Neanderthal-derived DNA in Eurasian genomes implies that the (unlikely) event of a discovery of a single living Eurasian male exhibiting a Neanderthal patrilineal line would immediately push back T-MRCA (\\"time to MRCA\\") to at least twice its current estimate. However, the discovery of a Neanderthal Y-chromosome by Mendez et al. A 2016 study suggests the extinction of Neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the Neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of contemporary human genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from Homo erectus.

Her politics were on the left wing of Austrian feminism and she allied with proletarian organizations in campaigns around education and legal protection for working-class women. Life Fickert was the daughter of Wilhelm Fickert, a Viennese court printer, and his wife Louise. She had a sister, Marianne, and two brothers, Emil and Willy. She attended the Englisher Fraulein convent school from 1869 and then the Lehrerinnen- Bildungsanstalt St Anna, a teacher training college, from which she graduated with honours in 1876. She began to teach that same year at a girls' school in the Schulegasse of Vienna. Fickert was a teacher for all her professional life. She left the Catholic Church in 1893 and publicly criticized the religious basis of school instruction in Austria at that time. As a result, she endured vitriolic attacks by the clerical (and anti-Semitic) Christian Social Party which continued throughout her life. Her first public political act was to organize a petition against the disfranchisement of women voters in government elections in Lower Austria which followed a political reorganization in the region in 1889. She collected over 1000 signatures from women protesting at their loss of the right to vote granted in 1862. Nevertheless, the measure went ahead. This began her career as campaigner for universal women's suffrage in Austria. She was also active in campaigns to unionize women civil servants and for better treatment of prostitutes.Ariadne web Auguste Fickert co-founded the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein (General Austrian Women's Association) in 1893.Biographical Dictionary of Women's Movements and Feminisms..' 2006 This organization campaigned for the improvement of proletarian women's lives. It was the most radical of the feminist organizations in Austria at that time. She was editor of its publications, the Dokumente der Frauen (Documents of Women) and Neues Frauenleben (New Woman's Life). In 1897 she became the organization's director. She worked closely with a friend Marie Lang but a falling-out and public argument caused her to relinquish her roles in the papers to Lang. Her intransigent nature contributed to this failure to work jointly with other women. Thereafter she was an inspirational figurehead to the women's movement in Austria. In 1902 Fickert started a magazine which she called Neues Frauenleben with Leopoldine Kulka as its editor. Kulka was a historian of literature and the first woman lecturer at the University of Vienna. Her close companion and friend through her adult life was Ida Baumann, also a teacher, who shared her early steps into political action and remained close to her all her life. Baumann avoided the limelight and did not achieve the fame of Fickert. At the end of her life, Fickert was involved with the Eink√ºchenhaus (one-kitchen house), a housing cooperative for professional women. In 1910, aged 55, Fickert suffered internal pain attributed to organ failure and died on 9 June at a sanatorium in Maria Ensedorf, Lower Austria. She is buried in the Neustift am Walde cemetery in Vienna. Honors Statue to Fickert in the T√ºrkenschanzpark, Vienna In 1929, the sculptor Franz Seifert created a memorial to her. This is now located at the T√ºrkenschanzpark in W√§hring, Vienna and this includes the inscription: \\"Full of courage and energy she sacrificed her life to high ideals.\\" The Fickertgasse, a street in Vienna, was named after her in 1926.

Located between the village of Godshill and the town of Fordingbridge, it is bounded on the western edge by the River Avon. Now run as a holiday centre, Sandy Balls is owned by Away Resorts. The first Sandy Balls logo View from Good Friday Hill Name The estate's name has been traced as far back as the reign of Henry VII. It appeared on maps and other documents of the time as \\"Sandyballas,\\" which is the description given to the dome-shaped sand and gravel outcrops on the western boundary of the site. Many of these outcrops remain, including ones called Good Friday Hill and Giant's Grave. Due to the estate's name having a humorous sound in Modern English colloquial usage, Sandy Balls has been used in various jokes and comedies. On the comedy panel show Have I Got News For You, guest host Alexander Armstrong introduced a promotional video for Sandy Balls that made fun of the resort's name.Have I Got News For You, Series 39 Episode 2. First broadcast on BBC One, 9:00pm Thu, 8 Apr 2010 History Grave of Ernest Westlake on a path to the River Avon In 1919 the estate came up for sale to pay for death duties which arose on the death of Sir Edward Hulse in the first World War. Ernest Westlake, an anthropologist stimulated by the ideas and work of Ernest Thompson Seton bought the land as a site for his newly formed youth movement the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry. After the death of Ernest his son Aubrey Westlake carried on his ideas and the forerunner of Forest School Camps was established. The first Head master was Cuthbert Rutter, Aubrey's cousin. The estate also served as a home for Grith Fyrd during the 1930s. Development into a holiday centre In 1934, 12 simply furnished camping huts were built and next year the first brochure was produced, entitled \\"Sandy Balls for the Beauty Spot Holiday\\". As the original aim of Aubrey Westlake was to use the location to provide a simple, low cost holiday for families, the original cabins were placed among the trees. War years During the war the estate served as temporary accommodation for evacuees and for families whose main bread winner was on active service. A large air raid shelter was built and a Red Cross post established. Continued development Through the 1950s and 1960s the Westlake family continued the location's development as a holiday centre. Accommodations were greatly extended and a restaurant and shop were added (with the latter two locations using produce grown on the estate). In the 1980s the holiday centre was extensively developed and modernised by Richard Westlake. In 2007 a major redevelopment was carried out, making the central area into a piazza and adding the bistro restaurant and adding new retail spaces including the bike hire shop. A new reception building was built with a roof covered with sedums and other plants. In 2017 ownership was transferred from the Westlake family to Away Resorts Limited.Companies House 2017 Confirmation Statement for Sandy Balls Estate LImited Environment The area has a wide range of wildlife and approximately 75% of the site is covered with vegetation which has been very carefully managed to allow native species to flourish.

The ranch, owned by actor and stuntman Ray \\"Crash\\" Corrigan, was located in the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains in the Santa Susana Pass area of Simi Valley in eastern Ventura County, California. It was destroyed by wildfires in 1976 and 1979. The site is currently a public park in the City of Simi Valley, called Corriganville Park, and operated by Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. Actors in an outdoor shooting-and-death scene, 1963 Children playing at Corriganville, 1963. Movies Built on land purchased by Corrigan in 1937, the ranch provided scenery as well as man-made structures and sets, and served as the background scenery for movies and television programs such as Fort Apache, Buffalo Bill in Tomahawk Territory, The Robe, The Lone Ranger, The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, Sky King, Circus Boy, and Star Trek. The visual environment was that of a picturesque California oak woodland. The ranch provided terrain such as lakes, mountains, caves, rock outcroppings and overhangs, and large boulders. The small man-made lake featured a cliff waterfall, as well as an underwater bunker with thick-glassed windows that would allow underwater scenes to be shot, while keeping the camera and crew dry. The property included the Army fort built for John Ford's 1948 film Fort Apache that was subsequently rented to many other film productions by Corrigan.p.55 Lewis, C. Jack White Horse, Black Hat: A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row Rowman & Littlefield, 1 Jan 2002 Other sets included Silvertown, a western street with saloon, hotel, jail, livery stable, corral, blacksmith, shops, and a bank. There was also an outlaw shack and a church that doubled as a schoolhouse. Some of these structures had small living quarters while others had showers and restrooms for the cast and crew. It's unclear if any had interior sets that were used onscreen, although there was a soundstage in the hotel building where interior sets may have been constructed for the movie companies' use (jail cell, bunkhouse, etc.). Many of the interior shots may have been made at various studios around Hollywood‚ÄîRepublic Studios, Monogram Studios, etc. in order to match the outdoor scenes shot at Corriganville. Corrigan's own home on the property was used for ranch-house exterior shots. His house was one of the first structures erected at the ranch in 1938-1939. Cowboy stars who filmed there include: Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Buster Crabbe, John Wayne, Randolph Scott, Smiley Burnette, Clayton Moore, Jay Silverheels, Charles Starrett, Ken Maynard, Kermit Maynard, Hoot Gibson, Bob Steele, Tex Ritter, Robert Taylor and of course Crash Corrigan himself. Estimates of the number of movies and television shows filmed there range from the hundreds to the thousands. Tourism The ranch was open to the public on weekends and holidays from 1949 to 1965. For an admission price of one dollar, visitors could experience a variety of stuntman shows, movie and TV actors (often Crash himself) signing autographs and posing for pictures, western street movie sets (\\"Silvertown\\"), frontier Army fort (\\"Fort Apache\\"), and Mexican village, many made up of real working buildings and not just set fronts as is common on many studio backlots. Other weekend attractions included live western music, Indian crafts, stagecoach rides, pony rides, and boating on the ranch's artificial lake. Transition In 1965 Ray Corrigan sold the property, which was acquired by comedian and property speculator Bob Hope. A housing subdivision called Hopetown was developed and built on a parcel near the park entrance. In the late 1960s and early 1970s part of the site was used for motorcycle racing. In 1970 the ranch was swept by fire. One of the last movies filmed there was Vigilante Force (1976). In 1979 another fire destroyed virtually all of the remaining structures. In 1988, of land comprising the principal working areas of the original Corriganville Ranch were purchased by the City of Simi Valley for use as a regional park. Regional park Foundations from old movie sets at Corriganville Regional Park Now named Corriganville Park, the site of Corriganville Movie Ranch is a public park operated by Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. The park has various concrete and brick foundations, the remains of movie and theme park buildings. Several signs present photographs and descriptions of filming locations. Hiking trails provide views from dramatic rock formations that made the park a popular filming location from the 1930s to 1960s. The park and the entire Santa Susana Pass area has many sites and vistas seen in movies and especially 1950s television westerns. The park's eastern area is part of the Santa Susana Pass wildlife corridor connecting the Simi Hills (and the Santa Monica Mountains) with the Santa Susana Mountains (and Tehachapi Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains). Hiking trails provide exploration and views. Rocky Peak Park is adjacent to the east.

The main objective of the naval service was to disrupt the supply lines from Egypt to Palestine, completing the Egyptian expeditionary force's encirclement, and force Egypt to allocate large forces to fight against targets at sea instead of on the ground, where Operation Yoav was conducted. Israel's four warships at the time, INS Wedgwood (K-18), INS Haganah (K-20), INS Ma'oz (K-24) and INS Noga (K-26), participated in the operation. The two main naval engagements were the October 19 battle in the waters of Majdal (today Ashkelon), and the sinking of the Egyptian flagship Emir Farouk on October 22, which also damaged an Egyptian minesweeper. The latter operation helped shape the Israeli navy's doctrine of the use of small weapon systems as opposed to conventional fleets. Background The Israeli naval service was founded in March 1948 out of the Palyam, a small naval contingent of the Palmach, reinforced by Jewish veterans of the Royal Navy and the Jewish Agency's maritime and fishing departments. At the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War on May 15, its small makeshift fleet was no match for the Egyptian Navy, which had complete sea supremacy. During the second truce of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, between July 18 and October 15, 1948, the naval service's strength increased significantly, totaling 16 vessels of a combined 7,000 tons. This included four warships (of which only INS Wedgwood and INS Haganah were fit for naval combat) called \\"the Big Flotilla\\", three landing craft, three service ships and six patrol boats. New equipment was also installed on the ships in the Big Flotilla, including tactical radios. The Egyptian fleet had three large and eight small minesweepers, four armed service ships, three corvettes, at least four patrol boats and at least 20 landing craft. This fleet's composition had not changed since the beginning of the war. The second truce started with an Israeli enclave in the Negev disconnected from the rest of the country. Military operations, including An-Far, Death to the Invader and GYS, to create a corridor between the two areas, failed. The Israeli political and military leadership therefore planned a massive operation, the largest undertaken by the IDF to that point. The operation was named The Ten Plagues (later renamed to Yoav), and involved the first major Israeli naval offensive campaign. Prelude In Operation Yoav, the naval service was not supposed to, and could not, act independently. Rather, all of its actions were coordinated with ground forces and conducted in accordance with the latter's requirements. Its actions, almost entirely confined to the Gaza‚ÄìMajdal corridor, were meant to create a naval blockade of the Egyptian expeditionary force in Israel (considering ground actions in the operation, this would translate into complete encirclement). This would be achieved by preventing any Egyptian naval actions in the area, including naval supply, reinforcement or seaborne evacuation of forces. In addition, the naval service would draw major Egyptian forces to the theater, preventing them from fighting in other areas where ground and air attacks would take place. The Israeli naval service operated under the assumption that a concentrated attack on the Egyptians would force them to use their entire military arsenal for defense, and they would therefore not have offensive capabilities. In light of that, only the six patrol boats (INS Portzim, INS Palmach, INS Dror, INS Sa'ar, INS Galia and INS Tirtza) were designated to guard the Israeli coast. The Egyptian Navy along the shore mainly operated out of Gaza and Majdal, both of which had open ports, making it particularly convenient to stage covert operations against them. Such operations were not planned in advance, however. The Israeli strategy rested on searching for targets and devising a tactic to engage them once located. One joint operation with the Givati Brigade was planned in advance‚Äîan attack on an Egyptian artillery battery in Isdud. Operations on October 15‚Äì18 In the first days of Operation Yoav, the naval service did not meet with success. Their mission was to patrol the Gaza‚ÄìMajdal area and engage any Egyptian ships whose location they could find, either through intelligence reports or visual identification. On October 16, 1948, the air force spotted an Egyptian vessel to the south of Gaza. The patrol boat INS Palmach took a sapper team to the location, but after reaching it at 02:15 on October 17, the crew failed to locate the ship. Another report on October 17 of two ships docking in Gaza similarly did not end in an engagement. On October 18 at 04:00, the naval service shelled Gaza and on October 21, Majdal. Both operations were carried out in tandem with the Israeli Air Force. A shelling of al-Arish was also planned for October 18, but the Israeli ships turned to Majdal to look for a reported Egyptian vessel, which they did not find. Operation Battery Operation Battery was the name given to the amphibious assault planned by the naval service and Givati Brigade against an Egyptian artillery battery in Isdud. The naval service could not mount such an operation independently as its nascent marine force had been almost entirely destroyed in land combat in Operation Death to the Invader. Plans had to be changed as more infantry soldiers showed up than expected, and an actual landing craft was used instead of boats as planned. The landing craft's crew had no knowledge of the vessel's specifications and did not know how to properly operate it. The vessel left Jaffa Port at 20:45 on October 16, followed by the patrol boat INS Sa'ar which carried the landing troops. They reached the destination at midnight, two hours late. Shortly after the 31 infantrymen embarked on the landing craft, its engine died. In addition, this was the first time that many of the Givati soldiers journeyed by sea, and most of them became seasick. The commander therefore decided to return to Jaffa. At 00:45, INS Sa'ar began towing the landing craft back (two hours later, the engine was restored), and at 06:30 the force was back in port. Battle near Majdal=Discovery and prelude On October 18 at 22:45, intelligence reported that the Egyptian forces in Iraq al-Manshiyya ran out of fuel and required supplies. Other reports came on October 19 at 06:30 that the Egyptians would try to evacuate their wounded through the sea. The naval service therefore prepared to tighten its blockade of the shore, with the help of the air force. At 10:00 on October 19, a specific air force report pointed to an Egyptian vessel unloading cargo in Gaza. At 10:10, when they received the intercept order, INS Wedgwood, INS Haganah and INS Noga were on a routine patrol about 15 nautical miles off the shore of Gaza. They moved south and at 10:25 turned to move closer to land and to Gaza. At 11:00, an Egyptian ship was spotted in Majdal, and at 11:21, after coming closer, discovered that it was a corvette unloading cargo and troops. It is unclear whether the ship had been in Majdal from the start, or if it had moved there from Gaza since the air force report. The Israeli attack began on 12:03. The Israeli commander, David Maimon, ordered the ships to cross the T so that the starboard side of his ships would be facing the bow of the Egyptian vessel. At 12:25, INS Noga retreated, as it was armed only with 20 mm cannons which was considered insufficient for the battle. Battle At 12:29, it was attacked by an Egyptian Spitfire and returned fire, but the craft missed one another. Wedgwood and Haganah closed in on the shore, and at 12:30 opened fire on the Egyptian ship from a range of about . Wedgwood stayed closer to the shore, with Haganah further at sea. At 12:38, the Egyptian corvette fired back, but missed. The Israeli ships hit and damaged it, which caused the corvette to start moving south. Wedgwood had come dangerously close to the shore and ran the risk of running aground, and also blocked Haganahs field of fire. Therefore, Haganah initially stayed near Majdal while Wedgwood moved south to chase the corvette. At 12:52, Egyptian combat aircraft appeared on the scene, but did not engage the Israeli vessels. Both Haganah and Wedgwood exchanged fire with the Egyptian corvette but the Israeli cannons were of low quality and jammed frequently. They registered hits, but did not impair the corvette's ability to move or fire back. The corvette was also unable to do damage. Egyptian Spitfires commenced bombing runs on Haganah, but dropped the bombs from a high altitude, allowing the ship to avoid most of them. The ship shot down one of the planes, which exploded near the surface of the water, damaging Haganah and injuring five of its crew members, one of whom died of his wounds half an hour later. Mordechai Limon, the deputy commander of Haganah and a future admiral, was among the wounded. By this time, Haganahs bow cannon had been disabled. In light of these developments, David Maimon ordered a retreat to Jaffa. Maimon also requested air support at the time of the Egyptian aerial attack. The Israeli command answered that it had sent aircraft to assist, but these did not arrive during the battle. Moreover, the command incorrectly believed that two Egyptian ships had been in the vicinity‚Äîa transport ship, according to earlier air reconnaissance, and a corvette. Despite Maimon's order, Wedgwood continued chasing the Egyptian corvette while coming under fire from the aircraft. At 12:25, its bow cannon was damaged, and it turned and fired from the stern, then around again when the bow cannon was repaired. Haganah turned to assist Wedgwood, but at 13:40 the Egyptian coastal battery came online and started firing at Haganah. Haganah turned around again toward the open sea. Wedgwood was also hit by the shore artillery, suffering minor damage. At this point the corvette had gone out of range and Wedgwood began to retreat north, but Egyptian Spitfires attacked it, dropping three bombs, one of which wounded a crew member. Both Israeli ships made it to Jaffa safely, but the port there could not undertake the repairs, so the ships sailed to Haifa. In all, they fired over 200 shells during the battle, few of which resulted in direct hits on the Egyptian corvette. The ships returned to active duty one day after the battle. On October 21, Wedgwood and Haganah conducted a skirmish with coastal batteries in Majdal. They began the attack at 06:40, in conjunction with an air force bombing raid, and retreated at 07:10. Sinking of Emir Farouk=Prelude Emir Farouk In March 1948, David Ben-Gurion ordered Ze'ev HaYam (literally, Sea Wolf), one of the main figures in Israel's early navy and merchant marine, to go to Italy to find ships that could be procured for the naval service. While Ze'ev HaYam procured two large motor boats and two landing craft, he wanted to acquire the Decima Flottiglia MAS's MT explosive motorboats that had been used in the Raid on Souda Bay to ram into and destroy larger ships. Ze'ev HaYam believed that these boats could turn the tide of the war. With the help of a relative and Ben-Gurion's consent, he bought six refurbished boats for $3,000 each from an ailing factory, and while the factory owners were told what the boats were for, to the outside they were disguised as racing boats. In August 1948, the naval service's sabotage unit (officially, the Rescue Boat Unit), commanded by Yohai Bin-Nun and later transformed through merger into Shayetet 13, received the MT motorboats. The assembly and preparation of all the boats was not completed until the final days of Operation Yoav. The assembly of the boats, the training, and indeed the essence of the sabotage unit were so secret that even Paul Shulman, deputy commander of the naval service, was not in on it. Boats of these type served the Italian Navy in World War II and proved effective against British targets, especially in the raid on Souda Bay. The method of operation was to load about of explosives into the bow and ram into an enemy ship. The sole sailor, manning a detachable float, would eject about short of the target. Training on the first boats to arrive was done in the Sea of Galilee, with the Italian sailor Fiorenzo Capriotti teaching the Israelis how to use them. More training was done later near Jaffa. The saboteurs themselves prepared four boats to be used in future operations. After believing that they could operate independently, but being proven wrong in the training, the naval service decided to store the boats in INS Ma'oz, due to its stern's construction and because Ma'oz had poor armament and could not be counted on in ship-to-ship combat. Contrary to the modus operandi for the Italian sabotage units on World War II, the Israelis sought to prevent its soldiers from being taken prisoner. Therefore, a special rescue boat was allocated to retrieve the saboteurs, leaving three actual sabotage boats. Bin Nun engineered a lasso-like belt that would be cast into the water by the rescue crew, the swimmer would put him arm into it, and be hauled onto the boat. On October 22 at 16:10, two Egyptian ships were spotted off the Gaza coast‚Äîthe flagship of the Egyptian Navy, Emir Farouk, and a . The operation against them was preceded by a difficulty of obtaining permission to act. Gershon Zak, head of the naval service, and Paul Shulman, his deputy and head of the main flotilla, supported the operation, while chief of operations Yigael Yadin opposed, in light of an impending ceasefire and lack of prior experience with this method of warfare. The Israeli high command had issued an order to cease all attacks by 15:00 that day, and reiterated it at 17:30. Meanwhile, Paul Shulman, who was aboard one of the ships, repeatedly sent requests to Gershon Zak for the permission to attack. Zak appealed personally to David Ben-Gurion, who was concerned for the operation's chances. He consented in the end, by which time Shulman had told his soldiers that the attack would not be taking place. They were rousted again after official permission was granted at 18:10. Operation At 18:40, INS Ma'oz detached from the rest of the flotilla and sailed to a spot northwest of Gaza. The spot was calculated based on the ship's ability to intercept fleeing Egyptian vessels by sailing south, and the expected light projection during such an encounter (the moonlight would reveal the Egyptian forces while hiding the Israeli). Additionally, the ship was ordered to stay put in its location, so that despite its camouflage, the returning Israeli sailors would be able to find it. However, it turned out that Maoz went further south than it was supposed to. Maoz released its five boats at 21:10, and by 22:00, the boats were in close proximity to the Egyptian vessels. Two of the boats, manned by Ya'akov Vardi and Zalman Abramov, were intended for the actual sabotage, one as a reserve, manned by the commander Yohai Bin-Nun, and one to collect the commandos after the operation, manned by Yitzhak Brockman and Ya'akov Reitov. The Israeli sailors used helmets with infrared lights to ease the extraction process. The Egyptian ships, believing that a ceasefire was already in effect, had their lights on and were easy to spot. Despite this, according to a later Israeli estimate, they had been on full alert. Because the Egyptian ships were facing one another, Bin-Nun decided that Abramov and Vardi would attack the bows of Emir Farouk and the minesweeper, respectively. This would make it more difficult for the Egyptians to fire at the boats should they have spotted them, because they could hit each other. The sabotage team and Ben-Gurion. From left to right: Zalman Abramov, Yohai Bin-Nun, Ya'akov Reitov, David Ben-Gurion (PM/MoD), Ya'akov Vardi, Yitzhak Brockman, Ya'akov Dori (CoS) While the Israelis were preparing, the two ships started moving: Emir Farouk went north and the minesweeper went south. This hastened the Israeli attack. Abramov's boat attacked first, causing the Egyptians to fire at random. Vardi's boat mistakenly turned to attack Emir Farouk as well. Vardi failed to eject due to a technical difficulty, but managed to turn around and strike again. In the dark, Abramov believed that Vardi's was the extraction boat and caught on, but detached from it as well before it rammed into the Egyptian ship. Vardi's actions also confused Yitzhak Brockman on the rescue boat, who had been moving toward Emir Farouk, and now believed that Vardi was turning around to collect Abramov. Brockman therefore started moving in Bin-Nun's direction. Emir Farouk sank in about five minutes. Yohai Bin-Nun, who was in the reserve boat, noticed the mistake made by Vardi, and himself rammed the minesweeper. He was spotted and fired at, and managed to eject from his boat only short of the target. The minesweeper suffered significant damage, but did not sink and was hauled back to Alexandria. It was subsequently scrapped by the Egyptian Navy. Egyptian coastal artillery opened a barrage on the general area, but did not spot their targets. The extraction boat collected the commandos and remained in the area to assess the damage, estimating about 200‚Äì300 Egyptian survivors. At 22:25 it started moving toward where it believed Maoz was. The commandos, despite spotting it from a very close range, found Maoz closer than they had thought, and by 23:10 all the commandos were back on the ship. Aftermath The operation achieved the element of surprise, as the Egyptians were unaware that Israel was employing explosive boats. On the Israeli side, the action was top-secret and unknown to the media. INS Ma'oz stayed at sea for three days to cover its tracks. The operation strengthened the notion that the Israeli navy could not be solely a conventional one, and had instead to incorporate naval commandos and other small weapon systems as an integral part of its doctrine. For his exploits, Yohai Bin-Nun received the Hero of Israel citation, and the commando crew was invited to lunch by David Ben-Gurion. Bin-Nun remained with the Israel Navy after its founding and went on to hold various command positions until becoming chief of the navy in 1960. The operation strengthened his belief that it was possible and preferable to defeat superior numbers and weaponry with cheap but unconventional warfare.

The horizontal lines represent 'multiregional evolution' gene flow between regional lineages. In Weidenreich's original graphic,https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Weidenreichs-network-of-human- evolution-as-illustrated-in-his-book-Apes-Giants-and_fig2_271701682 there were also diagonal lines between the populations, e.g. between African H. erectus and Archaic Asians and between Asian H. erectus and Archaic Africans. This created a \\"trellis\\" (as Wolpoff called ithttps://books.google.co.in/books?id=dOC38AS_VfkC&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false) or a \\"network\\" that emphasized gene flow between geographic regions and within time. It is important to remember that the populations on the chart are not discrete ‚Äì i.e., they do not represent different species, but are samples within a long lineage experiencing extensive gene flow. The multiregional hypothesis, multiregional evolution (MRE), or polycentric hypothesis is a scientific model that provides an alternative explanation to the more widely accepted \\"Out of Africa\\" model of monogenesis for the pattern of human evolution. Multiregional evolution holds that the human species first arose around two million years ago and subsequent human evolution has been within a single, continuous human species. This species encompasses all archaic human forms such as H. erectus and Neanderthals as well as modern forms, and evolved worldwide to the diverse populations of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). The hypothesis contends that the mechanism of clinal variation through a model of \\"Centre and Edge\\" allowed for the necessary balance between genetic drift, gene flow and selection throughout the Pleistocene, as well as overall evolution as a global species, but while retaining regional differences in certain morphological features. Proponents of multiregionalism point to fossil and genomic data and continuity of archaeological cultures as support for their hypothesis. The multiregional hypothesis was first proposed in 1984, and then revised in 2003. In its revised form, it is similar to the Assimilation Model, which holds that modern humans originated in Africa and today share a predominant recent African origin, but have also absorbed small, geographically variable, degrees of admixture from other regional (archaic) hominin species.  History = Overview  The Multiregional hypothesis was proposed in 1984 by Milford H. Wolpoff, Alan Thorne and Xinzhi Wu.Wolpoff, M. H., Wu, X. Z., & Alan, G. (86). G. Thorne: 1984, \\"Modern Homo Sapiens Origins: A General Theory of Hominid Evolution Involving the Fossil Evidence from east Asia\\". The Origins of Modern Humans, Liss, New York, 411‚Äì83. Wolpoff credits Franz Weidenreich's \\"Polycentric\\" hypothesis of human origins as a major influence, but cautions that this should not be confused with polygenism, or Carleton Coon's model that minimized gene flow. According to Wolpoff, multiregionalism was misinterpreted by William W. Howells, who confused Weidenreich's hypothesis with a polygenic \\"candelabra model\\" in his publications spanning five decades: Through the influence of Howells, many other anthropologists and biologists have confused multiregionalism with polygenism i.e. separate or multiple origins for different populations. Alan Templeton for example notes that this confusion has led to the error that gene flow between different populations was added to the Multiregional hypothesis as a \\"special pleading in response to recent difficulties\\", despite the fact: \\"parallel evolution was never part of the multiregional model, much less its core, whereas gene flow was not a recent addition, but rather was present in the model from the very beginning\\" (emphasis in original). Despite this, multiregionalism is still confused with polygenism, or Coon's model of racial origins, from which Wolpoff and his colleagues have distanced themselves.Wolpoff, M. H. and R. Caspari. 1997. Race and human evolution: A fatal attraction. New York: Simon and Schuster.Wolpoff, M.H., and R. Caspari. (2000). \\"The Many Species of Humanity\\". PrzeglƒÖd Antropologiczny (Anthropological Review) 63(1): 3‚Äì17. Wolpoff has also defended Wiedenreich's Polycentric hypothesis from being labeled polyphyletic. Weidenreich himself in 1949 wrote: \\"I may run the risk of being misunderstood, namely that I believe in polyphyletic evolution of man\\".Weidenreich, F. (1949). \\"Interpretations of the fossil material\\". In: Early Man in the Far East: Studies in Physical Anthropology. Howells, W. W (ed). Studies in Physical Anthropology; No. 1, American Association of Physical Anthropologists, Detroit. pp. 149‚Äì57. In 1998, Wu founded a China-specific Multiregional model called \\"Continuity with [Incidental] Hybridization\\".Rosenberg, K. R., Wu, X. (2013). \\"A River Runs through It: Modern Human Origins in East Asia\\". In: The Origins of Modern Humans: Biology Reconsidered. Smith, F. H (ed). Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 89‚Äì122. Wu's variant only applies the Multiregional hypothesis to the East Asian fossil record, and is popular among Chinese scientists.Liu, L., Chen, X. (2012). The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age. Cambridge University Press. p. 14: \\"the majority of Chinese archaeologists and palaeontologists support[s] the multiregional development model, proposing a hypothesis of regional continuity with hybridization between immigrants and indigenous populations in the evolution from H. erectus to H. sapiens in East Asia.\\" However, James Leibold, a political historian of modern China, has argued the support for Wu's model is largely rooted in Chinese nationalism.Leibold, J. (2012). \\"'Filling in the Nation: The Spatial Trajectory of Prehistoric Archaeology in Twentieth-Century China,\\" in Transforming History: The Making of a Modern Academic Discipline in Twentieth Century China, eds. Brian Moloughney and Peter Zarrow, pp. 333‚Äì71 (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press). Outside of China, the Multiregional hypothesis has limited support, held only by a small number of paleoanthropologists.Begun, DR. (2013). \\"The Past, Present and Future of Palaeoanthropology\\". In: A Companion to Paleoanthropology. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 8: \\"It needs to be noted, however, that this [Multiregional model] is a minority view among paleoanthropologists, most of whom support the African replacement model.\\"  \\"Classic\\" vs \\"weak\\" multiregionalism  Chris Stringer, a leading proponent of the more mainstream recent African origin theory, debated Multiregionalists such as Wolpoff and Thorne in a series of publications throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.Stringer, C. B. (1992). \\"Replacement, continuity and the origin of Homo sapiens\\". In: Continuity or replacement? Controversies in Homo sapiens evolution. F. H. Smith (ed). Rotterdam: Balkema. pp. 9‚Äì24.Br√§uer, G., & Stringer, C. (1997). \\"Models, polarization, and perspectives on modern human origins\\". In: Conceptual issues in modern human origins research. New York: Aldine de Gruyter. pp. 191‚Äì201. Stringer describes how he considers the original Multiregional hypothesis to have been modified over time into a weaker variant that now allows a much greater role for Africa in human evolution, including anatomical modernity (and subsequently less regional continuity than was first proposed). Stringer distinguishes the original or \\"classic\\" Multiregional model as having existed from 1984 (its formulation) until 2003, to a \\"weak\\" post-2003 variant that has \\"shifted close to that of the Assimilation Model\\". Genetic studies The finding that \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\" was relatively recent and African seemed to give the upper hand to the proponents of the Out of Africa hypothesis. But in 2002, Alan Templeton published a genetic analysis involving other loci in the genome as well, and this showed that some variants that are present in modern populations existed already in Asia hundreds of thousands of years ago. This meant that even if our male line (Y chromosome) and our female line (mitochondrial DNA) came out of Africa in the last 100,000 years or so, we have inherited other genes from populations that were already outside of Africa. Since this study other studies have been done using much more data (see Phylogeography).  Fossil evidence = Morphological clades  Replica of Sangiran 17 Homo erectus skull from Indonesia showing obtuse face to vault angle determined by fitting of bones at brow. Cast of anatomically modern human Kow Swamp 1 skull from Australia with a face to vault angle matching that of Sangiran 17 (Wolpoff's reconstruction). Proponents of the multiregional hypothesis see regional continuity of certain morphological traits spanning the Pleistocene in different regions across the globe as evidence against a single replacement model from Africa. In general, three major regions are recognized: Europe, China, and Indonesia (often including Australia).Wolpoff, M. H. (1985). Human evolution at the peripheries: the pattern at the eastern edge. Hominid Evolution: past, present and future, 355‚Äì65.Wolpoff, M.H., A.G. Thorne, F.H. Smith, D.W. Frayer, and G.G. Pope: Multiregional Evolution: A World-Wide Source for Modern Human Populations. In: Origins of Anatomically Modern Humans, edited by M.H. Nitecki and D.V. Nitecki. Plenum Press, New York. pp. 175‚Äì99. Wolpoff cautions that the continuity in certain skeletal features in these regions should not be seen in a racial context, instead calling them morphological clades; defined as sets of traits that \\"uniquely characterise a geographic region\\". According to Wolpoff and Thorne (1981): \\"We do not regard a morphological clade as a unique lineage, nor do we believe it necessary to imply a particular taxonomic status for it\\". Critics of multiregionalism have pointed out that no single human trait is unique to a geographical region (i.e. confined to one population and not found in any other) but Wolpoff et al. (2000) note that regional continuity only recognizes combinations of features, not traits if individually accessed, a point they elsewhere compare to the forensic identification of a human skeleton: Combinations of features are \\"unique\\" in the sense of being found in only one region, or more weakly limited to one region at high frequency (very rarely in another). Wolpoff stresses that regional continuity works in conjunction with genetic exchanges between populations. Long-term regional continuity in certain morphological traits is explained by Alan Thorne's \\"Centre and Edge\\"Thorne, A.G. (1981). \\"The Centre and the Edge: The significance of Australian hominids to African Palaeoanthropology\\". Proceedings of the 8th Pan-African Congress of Prehistory (Nairobi), pp. 180‚Äì81. Nairobi: National Museums of Kenya. population genetics model which resolves Weidenreich's paradox of \\"how did populations retain geographical distinctions and yet evolve together?\\". For example, in 2001 Wolpoff and colleagues published an analysis of character traits of the skulls of early modern human fossils in Australia and central Europe. They concluded that the diversity of these recent humans could not \\"result exclusively from a single late Pleistocene dispersal\\", and implied dual ancestry for each region, involving interbreeding with Africans. = Indonesia, Australia = Thorne held that there was regional continuity in Indonesia and Australia for a morphological clade. This sequence is said to consist of the earliest fossils from Sangiran, Java, that can be traced through Ngandong and found in prehistoric and recent Aboriginal Australians. In 1991, Andrew Kramer tested 17 proposed morphological clade features. He found that: \\"a plurality (eight) of the seventeen non-metric features link Sangiran to modern Australians\\" and that these \\"are suggestive of morphological continuity, which implies the presence of a genetic continuum in Australasia dating back at least one million years\\" but Colin Groves has criticized Kramer's methodology, pointing out that the polarity of characters was not tested and that the study is actually inconclusive.Groves, C.P. (1997). \\"Thinking about Evolutionary Change The Polarity of Our Ancestors\\". In: Conceptual issues in modern human origins research. Transaction Publishers. Dr. Phillip Habgood discovered that the characters said to be unique to the Australasian region by Thorne are plesiomorphic: Yet, regardless of these criticisms Habgood (2003) allows for limited regional continuity in Indonesia and Australia, recognizing four plesiomorphic features which do not appear in such a unique combination on fossils in any other region: a sagittally flat frontal bone, with a posterior position of minimum frontal breadth, great facial prognathism, and zygomaxillary tuberosities.Habgood, P.J. (2003). A Morphometric Investigation into the Origins of Anatomically Modern Humans. British Archaeological Reports, International Series 1176. Oxford England: Archaeopress. This combination, Habgood says, has a \\"certain Australianness about it\\". Wolpoff, initially skeptical of Thorne's claims, became convinced when reconstructing the Sangiran 17 Homo erectus skull from Indonesia, when he was surprised that the skull's face to vault angle matched that of the Australian modern human Kow Swamp 1 skull in excessive prognathism. Durband (2007) in contrast states that \\"features cited as showing continuity between Sangiran 17 and the Kow Swamp sample disappeared in the new, more orthognathic reconstruction of that fossil that was recently completed\\". Baba et al. who newly restored the face of Sangiran 17 concluded: \\"regional continuity in Australasia is far less evident than Thorne and Wolpoff argued\\". = China = Replica of Homo erectus (\\"Peking man\\") skull from China. Xinzhi Wu has argued for a morphological clade in China spanning the Pleistocene, characterized by a combination of 10 features.Wu, X., Poirier, F. E. (1995).Human evolution in China: a metric description of the fossils and a review of the sites. New York: Oxford University Press. The sequence is said to start with Lantian and Peking Man, traced to Dali, to Late Pleistocene specimens (e.g. Liujiang) and recent Chinese. Habgood in 1992 criticized Wu's list, pointing out that most of the 10 features in combination appear regularly on fossils outside China.Habgood, P.J. (1992). \\"The origin of anatomically modern humans in east Asia\\". In: G. Br√§uer, and F.H. Smith (eds.) Continuity or Replacement: Controversies in Homo sapiens evolution. pp. 273‚Äì88. He did though note that three combined: a non-depressed nasal root, non-projecting perpendicularly oriented nasal bones and facial flatness are unique to the Chinese region in the fossil record and may be evidence for limited regional continuity. However, according to Chris Stringer, Habgood's study suffered from not including enough fossil samples from North Africa, many of which exhibit the small combination he considered to be region-specific to China. Facial flatness as a morphological clade feature has been rejected by many anthropologists since it is found on many early African Homo erectus fossils, and is therefore considered plesiomorphic,Groves, C. P. (1989). \\"A regional approach to the problem of the origin of modern humans in Australasia\\". In: P. Mellars & CB. Stringer (eds). In: The Human Revolution. Princeton: Princeton University Press. pp. 274‚Äì85. but Wu has responded that the form of facial flatness in the Chinese fossil record appears distinct to other (i.e. primitive) forms. Toetik Koesbardiati in her PhD thesis \\"On the Relevance of the Regional Continuity Features of the Face in East Asia\\" also found that a form of facial flatness is unique to China (i.e. only appears there at high frequency, very rarely elsewhere) but cautions that this is the only available evidence for regional continuity: \\"Only two features appear to show a tendency as suggested by the Multiregional model: flatness at the upper face expressed by an obtuse nasio-frontal angle and flatness at the middle part of the face expressed by an obtuse zygomaxillay angle\\". Shovel-shaped incisors are commonly cited as evidence for regional continuity in China. Stringer (1992) however found that shovel-shaped incisors are present on >70% of the early Holocene Wadi Halfa fossil sample from North Africa, and common elsewhere.Stringer, C. B. (1992). \\"Replacement, continuity and the origin of Homo sapiens\\". In: Continuity or replacement? Controversies in Homo sapiens evolution. Rotterdam: A. A. Balkema. pp. 9‚Äì24. Frayer et al. (1993) have criticized Stringer's method of scoring shovel-shaped incisor teeth. They discuss the fact that there are different degrees of \\"shovelled\\" e.g. trace (+), semi (++), and marked (+++), but that Stringer misleadingly lumped all these together: \\"...combining shoveling categories in this manner is biologically meaningless and misleading, as the statistic cannot be validly compared with the very high frequencies for the marked shoveling category reported for East Asians.\\" Palaeoanthropologist Fred H. Smith (2009) also emphasizes that: \\"It is the pattern of shoveling that identities as an East Asian regional feature, not just the occurrence of shoveling of any sort\\".Cartmill, M & Smith, F. H. (2009). The Human Lineage. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 450. Multiregionalists argue that marked (+++) shovel-shaped incisors only appear in China at a high frequency, and have <10% occurrence elsewhere. = Europe = Comparison of modern human (left) and Neanderthal (right) skulls. Since the early 1990s, David W. Frayer has described what he regards as a morphological clade in Europe.Frayer, D. W. (1992). \\"The persistence of Neanderthal features in post-Neanderthal Europeans\\". In: Continuity or Replacement: Controversies in Homo sapiens Evolution. Rotterdam: Balkema, pp. 179‚Äì88.Frayer, D. W. (1992).\\"Evolution at the European edge: Neanderthal and the Upper Paleolithic relationships. Pr√©histoire Europ√©ene. 2:9‚Äì69.Frayer, D. W. (1997).\\"Perspectives on Neanderthals as ancestors\\". In: Conceptual Issues in Modern Human Origins Research. New York: Aldine de Gruyter. pp. 220‚Äì35. The sequence starts with the earliest dated Neanderthal specimens (Krapina and Saccopastore skulls) traced through the mid-Late Pleistocene (e.g. La Ferrassie 1) to Vindija Cave, and late Upper Palaeolithic Cro-Magnons or recent Europeans. Although many anthropologists consider Neanderthals and Cro Magnons morphologically distinct, Frayer maintains quite the opposite and points to their similarities, which he argues is evidence for regional continuity: Frayer et al. (1993) consider there to be at least four features in combination that are unique to the European fossil record: a horizontal- oval shaped mandibular foramen, anterior mastoid tubercle, suprainiac fossa and narrowing of the nasal breadth associated with tooth-size reduction. Regarding the latter, Frayer observes a sequence of nasal narrowing in Neanderthals, following through to late Upper Palaeolithic and Holocene (Mesolithic) crania. His claims are disputed by others, but have received support from Wolpoff, who regards late Neanderthal specimens to be \\"transitional\\" in nasal form between earlier Neanderthals and later Cro Magnons.Wolpoff, M. H. (1989). \\"The place of Neanderthals in human evolution\\". In: The Emergence of Modern Humans: Biocultural Adaptations in the Later Pleistocene. Trinkaus, E (ed.). Cambridge University Press. pp. 97‚Äì41. Based on other cranial similarities, Wolpoff et al. (2004) argue for a sizable Neanderthal contribution to modern Europeans. More recent claims regarding continuity in skeletal morphology in Europe focus on fossils with both Neanderthal and modern anatomical traits, to provide evidence of interbreeding rather than replacement.The Emerging Fate Of The Neandertals Examples include the Lapedo child found in Portugal and the Oase 1 mandible from Pe»ôtera cu Oase, Romania, though the Lapedo child is disputed by some.  Genetic evidence  Human mitochondrial DNA tree. \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\" is near the top of the diagram, next to the jagged arrow pointing to \\"Outgroup\\", and her distance from any nonafrican groups indicates that living human mitochondrial lineages coalesce in Africa.  Mitochondrial Eve  A 1987 analysis of mitochondrial DNA from 147 people by Cann et al. from around the world indicated that their mitochondrial lineages all coalesced in a common ancestor from Africa between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago. The analysis suggested that this reflected the worldwide expansion of modern humans as a new species, replacing, rather than mixing with, local archaic humans outside of Africa. Such a recent replacement scenario is not compatible with the Multiregional hypothesis and the mtDNA results led to increased popularity for the alternative single replacement theory. According to Wolpoff and colleagues: Multiregionalists have responded to what they see as flaws in the Eve theory,Wolpoff, M.; Thorne, A. (1991) \\"The case against Eve\\" New Scientist 130(1774): 37‚Äì41 and have offered contrary genetic evidences. Wu and Thorne have questioned the reliability of the molecular clock used to date Eve. Multiregionalists point out that Mitochondrial DNA alone can not rule out interbreeding between early modern and archaic humans, since archaic human mitochondrial strains from such interbreeding could have been lost due to genetic drift or a selective sweep. Wolpoff for example states that Eve is \\"not the most recent common ancestor of all living people\\" since \\"Mitochondrial history is not population history\\".  Neanderthal mtDNA  Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from Feldhofer and Vindija Cave are substantially different from modern human mtDNA. Multiregionalists however have discussed the fact that the average difference between the Feldhofer sequence and living humans is less than that found between chimpanzee subspecies, and therefore that while Neanderthals were different subspecies, they were still human and part of the same lineage.  Nuclear DNA  Initial analysis of Y chromosome DNA, which like mitochondrial DNA, is inherited from only one parent, was consistent with a recent African replacement model. However, the mitochondrial and Y chromosome data could not be explained by the same modern human expansion out of Africa; the Y chromosome expansion would have involved genetic mixing that retained regionally local mitochondrial lines. In addition, the Y chromosome data indicated a later expansion back into Africa from Asia, demonstrating that gene flow between regions was not unidirectional. An early analysis of 15 noncoding sites on the X chromosome found additional inconsistencies with the recent African replacement hypothesis. The analysis found a multimodal distribution of coalescence times to the most recent common ancestor for those sites, contrary to the predictions for recent African replacement; in particular, there were more coalescence times near 2 million years ago (mya) than expected, suggesting an ancient population split around the time humans first emerged from Africa as Homo erectus, rather than more recently as suggested by the mitochondrial data. While most of these X chromosome sites showed greater diversity in Africa, consistent with African origins, a few of the sites showed greater diversity in Asia rather than Africa. For four of the 15 gene sites that did show greater diversity in Africa, the sites' varying diversity by region could not be explained by simple expansion from Africa, as would be required by the recent African replacement hypothesis. Additional discussion of these results is available in a video of a presentation given by Hammer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff0jwWaPlnU (video) from about 40 to 50 minutes into the video. Later analyses of X chromosome and autosomal DNA continued to find sites with deep coalescence times inconsistent with a single origin of modern humans,The CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase CMAH pseudogene shows 2.9 Mya coalescence time. The PDHA1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) locus on the X chromosome has an estimated coalescence time of 1.86 Mya, inconsistent with a recent species origin, although the worldwide lineage pattern is unlike other autosomal sites and may be consistent with recent dispersal from Africa. A second group finds the same ancient origin for PDHA1, but finds no evidence of a recent expansion, consistent with other autosomal and X chromosome sites and contrary to mitochondrial data. The ASAH1 gene has two recently differentiated lineages with a coalescence time 2.4¬±.4 Mya not explainable by balancing selection. The V lineage shows evidence of recent positive selection. The lineage pattern may be the result of hybridization during a recent range expansion from Africa with the V lineage tracing to archaic humans from outside Africa, though it is also consistent with a mixture of two long isolated groups within Africa; it is not consistent with a recent origination of a modern human species that replaced archaic forms without interbreeding. diversity patterns inconsistent with a recent expansion from Africa,NAT2 SNPs lineages cluster in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia, with genetic distances scaling with geographic distances. Also see map; may resize browser window. or both.The NAT1 lineage tree is rooted in Eurasia with a coalescence time of 2.0 Mya that cannot be explained by balancing selection and with the NAT1*11A haplotype absent from subsaharan Africa. For example, analyses of a region of RRM2P4 (ribonucleotide reductase M2 subunit pseudogene 4) showed a coalescence time of about 2 Mya, with a clear root in Asia, while the MAPT locus at 17q21.31 is split into two deep genetic lineages, one of which is common in and largely confined to the present European population, suggesting inheritance from Neanderthals. In the case of the Microcephalin D allele, evidence for rapid recent expansion indicated introgression from an archaic population. However, later analysis, including of the genomes of Neanderthals, did not find the Microcephalin D allele (in the proposed archaic species), nor evidence that it had introgressed from an archaic lineage as previously suggested. In 2001, a DNA study of more than 12,000 men from 163 East Asian regions showed that all of them carry a mutation that originated in Africa about 35,000 to 89,000 years ago and these \\"data do not support even a minimal in situ hominid contribution in the origin of anatomically modern humans in East Asia\\". In a 2005 review and analysis of the genetic lineages of 25 chromosomal regions, Alan Templeton found evidence of more than 34 occurrences of gene flow between Africa and Eurasia. Of these occurrences, 19 were associated with continuous restricted gene exchange through at least 1.46 million years ago; only 5 were associated with a recent expansion from Africa to Eurasia. Three were associated with the original expansion of Homo erectus out of Africa around 2 million years ago, 7 with an intermediate expansion out of Africa at a date consistent with the expansion of Acheulean tool technology, and a few others with other gene flows such as an expansion out of Eurasia and back into Africa subsequent to the most recent expansion out of Africa. Templeton rejected a hypothesis of complete recent African replacement with greater than 99% certainty (p < 10‚àí17).  Ancient DNA  Recent analyses of DNA taken directly from Neanderthal specimens indicates that they or their ancestors contributed to the genome of all humans outside of Africa, indicating there was some degree of interbreeding with Neanderthals before their replacement. It has also been shown that Denisova hominins contributed to the DNA of Melanesians and Australians through interbreeding. By 2006, extraction of DNA directly from some archaic human samples was becoming possible. The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, and indicated that the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity was no more than 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sharing 1-4% more genetic variants with living non-Africans than with living humans in sub-Saharan Africa. In late 2010, a recently discovered non-Neanderthal archaic human, the Denisova hominin from south- western Siberia, was found to share 4‚Äì6% more of its genome with living Melanesian humans than with any other living group, supporting admixture between two regions outside of Africa. In August 2011, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles from the archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes were found to show patterns in the modern human population demonstrating origins from these non-African populations; the ancestry from these archaic alleles at the HLA-A site was more than 50% for modern Europeans, 70% for Asians, and 95% for Papua New Guineans. Proponents of the multiregional hypothesis believe the combination of regional continuity inside and outside of Africa and lateral gene transfer between various regions around the world supports the multiregional hypothesis. However, \\"Out of Africa\\" Theory proponents also explain this with the fact that genetic changes occur on a regional basis rather than a continental basis, and populations close to each other are likely to share certain specific regional SNPs while sharing most other genes in common.* Migration Matrix theory (A=Mt) indicates that dependent upon the potential contribution of Neanderthal ancestry, we would be able to calculate the percentage of Neanderthal mtDNA contribution to the human species. As we do not know the specific migration matrix, we are unable to input the exact data, which would answer these questions irrefutably.

Clockwise motion (abbreviated CW) proceeds in the same direction as a clock's hands: from the top to the right, then down and then to the left, and back up to the top. The opposite sense of rotation or revolution is (in Commonwealth English) anticlockwise (ACW) or (in North American English) counterclockwise (CCW). Terminology Before clocks were commonplace, the terms \\"sunwise\\" and \\"deasil\\", \\"deiseil\\" and even \\"deocil\\" from the Scottish Gaelic language and from the same root as the Latin \\"dexter\\" (\\"right\\") were used for clockwise. \\"Widdershins\\" or \\"withershins\\" (from Middle Low German \\"weddersinnes\\", \\"opposite course\\") was used for counterclockwise. The counterclockwise or anticlockwise direction The terms clockwise and counterclockwise can only be applied to a rotational motion once a side of the rotational plane is specified, from which the rotation is observed. For example, the daily rotation of the Earth is clockwise when viewed from above the South Pole, and counterclockwise when viewed from above the North Pole (considering \\"above a point\\" to be defined as \\"farther away from the center of earth and on the same ray\\"). Clocks traditionally follow this sense of rotation because of the clock's predecessor: the sundial. Clocks with hands were first built in the Northern Hemisphere (see Clock), and they were made to work like horizontal sundials. In order for such a sundial to work north of the equator during spring and summer, and north of the Tropic of Cancer the whole year, the noon-mark of the dial must be placed northward of the pole casting the shadow. Then, when the Sun moves in the sky (from east to south to west), the shadow, which is cast on the sundial in the opposite direction, moves with the same sense of rotation (from west to north to east). This is why hours must be drawn in horizontal sundials in that manner, and why modern clocks have their numbers set in the same way, and their hands moving accordingly. For a vertical sundial (such as those placed on the walls of buildings, the dial being below the post), the movement of the sun is from right to top to left, and, accordingly, the shadow moves from left to down to right, i.e., counterclockwise. This effect is caused by the plane of the dial having been rotated through the plane of the motion of the sun and thus the shadow is observed from the other side of the dial's plane and is observed as moving in the opposite direction. Some clocks were constructed to mimic this. The best-known surviving example is the astronomical clock in the M√ºnster Cathedral, whose hands move counterclockwise. Occasionally, clocks whose hands revolve counterclockwise are nowadays sold as a novelty. Historically, some Jewish clocks were built that way, for example in some synagogue towers in Europe such as the Jewish Town Hall in Prague, to accord with right-to-left reading in the Hebrew language. In 2014 under Bolivian president Evo Morales, the clock outside the Legislative Assembly in Plaza Murillo, La Paz, was shifted to counterclockwise motion to promote indigenous values. Usage=Shop-work Typical nuts, screws, bolts, bottle caps, and jar lids are tightened (moved away from the observer) clockwise and loosened (moved towards the observer) counterclockwise in accordance with the right-hand rule. Conventional direction of the axis of a rotating body To apply the right-hand rule, place one's loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw, nut, bolt, or cap ultimately to move, and the curl of the fingers, from the palm to the tips, will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw, nut, bolt or cap to achieve the desired result. Almost all threaded objects obey this rule except for a few left- handed exceptions described below. The reason for the clockwise standard for most screws and bolts is that supination of the arm, which is used by a right- handed person to tighten a screw clockwise, is generally stronger than pronation used to loosen. Sometimes the opposite (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading is used for a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed lug nuts on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other. Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings. Mathematics In trigonometry and mathematics in general, plane angles are conventionally measured counterclockwise, starting with 0¬∞ or 0 radians pointing directly to the right (or east), and 90¬∞ pointing straight up (or north). However, in navigation, compass headings increase clockwise around the compass face, starting with 0¬∞ at the top of the compass (the northerly direction), with 90¬∞ to the right (east). A circle defined parametrically in a positive Cartesian plane by the equations and is traced counterclockwise as the angle t increases in value, from the right-most point at . An alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point. Games and activities In general, most card games, board games, parlor games, and multiple team sports play in a clockwise turn rotation in Western Countries and Latin America with a notable resistance to playing in the opposite direction (counterclockwise). Traditionally (and still continued for the most part) turns pass counterclockwise in many Asian countries. In Western countries, when speaking and discussion activities take part in a circle, turns tend to naturally pass in a clockwise motion even though there is no obligation to do so. Curiously, unlike with games, there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counterclockwise motion. Notably, the game of baseball is played counterclockwise. In humans Most left-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings clockwise, while most right-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings counterclockwise. While this was theorized to result from dominant brain hemispheres,Theodore H. Blau, The torque test: A measurement of cerebral dominance. 1974, American Psychological Association. research shows little correlation and instead attributes it to muscle mechanics.

Naim, 197 Va 80; 87 S.E.2d 749 (1955), is a case regarding interracial marriage. The case was decided by the Supreme Court of Virginia on June 13, 1955. The Court held the marriage between the appellant (Han Say Naim) and the appellee (Ruby Elaine Naim) to be void under the Code of Virginia (1950). The appellee, a white woman living in Virginia, and the appellant, a Chinese man not living in Virginia, went to North Carolina to be married on June 26, 1952, specifically because there was a Virginia statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, banning interracial marriage, while North Carolina law banned marriages between whites and blacks but not between whites and Asians.Peter Wallenstein, Tell the Court I Love My Wife: Race, Marriage, and Law - An American History (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), pp. 180-83. (via GoogleBooks) They then returned to Virginia, where they lived as husband and wife. A year after the marriage, Ruby Naim filed for annulment, as the marriage was in contravention of Virginia's miscegenation laws, with Han Say Naim arguing that a marriage valid in North Carolina was valid throughout the United States. The circuit court of the city of Portsmouth granted an annulment, but Han Say Naim appealed to the state supreme court, which upheld the circuit court's decision.Charles Frank Robinson II, Dangerous Liaisons: Sex And Love in the Segregated South (University of Arkansas Press, 2003), pp.135-36. (via GoogleBooks) The Virginia statute stated: ::It shall hereafter be unlawful for any white person in this State to marry any save a white person, or a person with no other admixture of blood than white and American Indian. For the purpose of this chapter, the term 'white person' shall apply only to such person as has no trace whatever of any blood other than Caucasian; but persons who have one- sixteenth or less of the blood of the American Indian and have no other non- Caucasic blood shall be deemed to be white persons. All laws heretofore passed and now in effect regarding the intermarriage of white and colored persons shall apply to marriages prohibited by this chapter Han Say Naim's attorney, David Carliner, attempted to appeal the state's decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, with the backing of the American Jewish Congress, the Japanese American Citizens League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the Association of Immigration and Nationality Lawyers.Peggy Pascoe, What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 226-233.

Allen Basic beliefs Scholarly research demonstrates that Incan belief systems were integrated with their view of the cosmos, especially in regard to the way that the Inca observed the motions of the Milky Way and the solar system as seen from Cuzco, the Inca capital whose name meant the centre of the earth. From this perspective, their stories depict the movements of constellations, planets, and planetary formations, which are all connected to their agricultural cycles. This was especially important for the Inca, as they relied on cyclical agricultural seasons, which were not only connected to annual cycles, but to a much wider cycle of time (every 800 years at a time). This way of keeping time was deployed in order to ensure the cultural transmission of key information, in spite of regime change or social catastrophes. After the Spanish conquest of Peru by Francisco Pizarro, colonial officials burned the records kept by the Inca. There is currently a theory put forward by Gary Urton that the Quipus could have been a binary system capable of recording phonological or logographic data. Still, to date, all that is known is based on what was recorded by priests, from the iconography on Inca pottery and architecture, and from the myths and legends that have survived among the native peoples of the Andes. Inca foundation legends Manco C√°pac was the legendary founder of the Inca Dynasty in Peru and the Cusco Dynasty at Cusco. The legends and history surrounding him are very contradictory, especially those concerning his rule at Cuzco and his origins. In one legend, he was the son of Viracocha. In another, he was brought up from the depths of Lake Titicaca by the sun god Inti. However, commoners were not allowed to speak the name of Viracocha, which is possibly an explanation for the need for three foundation legends rather than just one.The History of the Incas by Pedro Sarmiento De Gamboa, Brian S. Bauer, Vania Smith There were also many myths about Manco C√°pac and his coming to power. In one myth, Manco C√°pac and his brother Pacha Kamaq were sons of the sun god Inti. Manco C√°pac was worshiped as a fire and sun god. In another myth, Manco C√°pac was sent with Mama Ocllo (others even mention numerous siblings) to Lake Titicaca where they resurfaced and settled on the Isla Del Sol. According to this legend, Manco C√°pac and his siblings were sent up to the earth by the sun god and emerged from the cave of Puma Orco at Paqariq Tampu carrying a golden staff called ‚Äòtapac-yauri‚Äô. They were instructed to create a Temple of the Sun in the spot where the staff sank into the earth to honor the sun god Inti, their father. During the journey, one of Manco's brothers (Ayar Cachi) was tricked into returning to Puma Urqu and sealed inside or alternatively was turned to ice, because his reckless and cruel behavior angered the tribes that they were attempting to rule. (huaca). Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa wrote that there was a hill referred to as Tambotoco, about 33 kilometers from Cuzco, where eight men and women emerged as the original Inca's. The men were Manco Capac, Ayar Auca, Ayar Cachi and Ayar Uchu. The women were Mama Ocllo, Mama Huaco, Mama Ipacura, and Mama Raua In another version of this legend, instead of emerging from a cave in Cuzco, the siblings emerged from the waters of Lake Titicaca. Since this was a later origin myth than that of Pacaritambo it may have been created as a ploy to bring the powerful Aymara tribes into the fold of the Tawantinsuyo. In the Inca Virachocha legend, Manco C√°pac was the son of Inca Viracocha of Paqariq Tampu which is 25 km (16 mi) south of Cuzco. He and his brothers (Ayar Auca, Ayar Cachi, and Ayar Uchu); and sisters (Mama Ocllo, Mama Huaco, Mama Raua, and Mama Cura) lived near Cusco at Paqariq Tampu, and uniting their people and the ten ayllu they encountered in their travels to conquer the tribes of the Cusco Valley. This legend also incorporates the golden staff, which is thought to have been given to Manco C√°pac by his father. Accounts vary, but according to some versions of the legend, the young Manco jealously betrayed his older brothers, killed them, and then became Cusco. Deities Supay, god of death, as interpreted in a carnival festival Like the Romans, the Incas permitted the cultures they integrated into their empire to keep their individual religions. Below are some of the various gods worshiped by the peoples of the Incan empire, many of which have overlapping responsibilities and domains. Unless otherwise noted, it can safely be assumed these were worshipped by different ayllus or worshipped in particular former states. *Apu was a god or spirit of mountains. All of the important mountains have their own Apu, and some of them receive sacrifices to bring out certain aspects of their being. Some rocks and caves also are credited as having their own apu.Sacred Mountain Expedition: April 2007 *Ataguchu was a god who assisted in creation myth. *Catequil was a god of thunder and lightning. *Cavillace was a virgin goddess who ate a fruit, which was actually the sperm of Coniraya, the moon god. When she gave birth to a son, she demanded that the father step forward. No one did, so she put the baby on the ground and it crawled towards Coniraya. She was ashamed because of Coniraya's low stature among the gods, and ran to the coast of Peru, where she changed herself and her son into rocks. *Ch'aska (\\"Venus\\") or Ch'aska Quyllur (\\"Venus star\\") was the goddess of dawn and twilight, the planet *Coniraya was the moon deity who fashioned his sperm into a fruit, which Cavillaca then ate. *Copacati was a lake goddess. *Ekeko was a god of the hearth and wealth. The ancients made dolls that represented him and placed a miniature version of their desires onto the doll; this was believed to caused the user to receive what he desired. *Illapa (\\"thunder and lightning\\"; a.k.a. Apu Illapu, Ilyap'a, Katoylla) was a very popular weather god. His holiday was on July 25. He was said to keep the Milky Way in a jug and use it to create rain. He appeared as a man in shining clothes, carrying a club and stones. He was formerly the main god of the Kingdom of Qulla after which the Qullasuyu province of the Inca Empire was named. *Inti was the sun god. Source of warmth and light and a protector of the people. Inti was considered the most important god. The Inca Emperors were believed to be the lineal descendants of the sun god. *Kon was the god of rain and wind that came from the south. He was a son of Inti and Mama Killa. *Mama Allpa was a fertility goddess depicted with multiple breasts. *Mama Qucha (\\"sea mother\\") was the sea and fish goddess, protectress of sailors and fishermen. In one legend she mothered Inti and Mama Killa with Wiraqucha. Representation of the cosmology of the Incas, according to Juan de Santa Cruz Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamayhua (1613), after a picture in the Sun Temple Qurikancha in Cusco, with Inti (the Sun), Killa (the Moon), Pachamama (Mother Earth), Mama Qucha (Mother Sea), and Chakana (Southern Cross) with Saramama (Mother Corn) and Kukamama (Mother Coca). *Mama Pacha (a.k.a. Pachamama) literally translates to \\"mother nature\\" and was the most important figure in mythology, second only to the Sun. She was the wife of Pacha Kamaq, a dragon, and a fertility deity who presided over planting and harvesting. She caused earthquakes. *Mama Killa (\\"mother moon\\" or \\"golden mother\\") was a marriage, festival and moon goddess and daughter of Wiraqucha and Mama Qucha, as well as wife and sister of Inti. She was the mother of Manqu Qhapaq, Pacha Kamaq, Kon and Mama Uqllu. *Mama Sara (\\"maize mother\\", a.k.a. Saramama) was the goddess of grain. She was associated with maize that grew in multiples or were similarly strange. These strange plants were sometimes dressed as dolls of Mama Sara. She was also associated with willow trees. *Pacha Kamaq (\\"Earth- maker\\") was a chthonic creator god, earlier worshiped by the Ichma but later adopted into the creation myth of the Inca. *Paryaqaqa was a god of water in pre-Inca mythology that was adopted by the Inca. He was a god of rainstorms and a creator-god. He was born a falcon but later became human. *Paricia was a god who sent a flood to kill humans who did not respect him adequately. Possibly another name for Pacha Kamaq or Paryaqaqa. *Supay was both the god of death and ruler of the Uku Pacha as well as a race of demons. *Urcaguary was the god of metals, jewels and other underground items of great value. *Urquchillay was a deity that watched over animals. *Viracocha was the god of everything. In the beginning he was the main god, but when Pachakuti became Inca emperor, he changed this god's importance, pointing out that the most important god was Inti. Important beliefs *Mama Uqllu was the sister and wife of Manqu Qhapaq. She was thought to have taught the Inca the art of spinning. *Mamaconas were similar to nuns and lived in temple sanctuaries. They dedicated their lives to Inti, and served the Inca and priests. Young girls of the nobility or of exceptional beauty were trained for four years as acllas and then had the option of becoming mamaconas or marrying Inca nobles. They are comparable to the Roman Vestal Virgins, though Inca society did not value virginity as a virtue the way Western societies have done throughout history. *In one legend, Unu Pachakuti was a great flood sent by Virachocha to destroy the giants that built Tiwanaku. *A Wak'a was a sacred object such as a mountain or a mummy. Important places Inca cosmology was ordered in three spatio-temporal levels or Pachas. These included: *Uku Pacha (\\"the lower world\\") was located within the earth's surface. *Kay Pacha was the world in which we live. *Hanan Pacha (\\"higher world\\") was the world above us where the sun and moon lived. The environment and geography were integral part of Inca mythology as well. Many prominent natural features within the Inca Empire were tied to important myths and legends amongst the Inca. For example, Lake Titicaca, an important body of water on the Altiplano, was incorporated into Inca myths, as the lake of origins from which the world began. Similarly, many of prominent Andean peaks played special roles within the mythology of the Incas. This is reflected in myths about the Paxil mountain, from which people were alleged to have been created from corn kernels that were scattered by the gods. Terrestrial environments were not the only type of environment that was important to mythology. The Incas often incorporated the stars into legends and myths. For example, many constellations were given names and were incorporated into stories, such as the star formations of the Great Llama and the Fox. While perhaps not relating to a single physical feature per se, environmental sound was extremely important in Incan mythology. For example, in the creation myth of Viracocha the sound of the god's voice is particularly important. Additionally, myths were transmitted orally, so the acoustics and sound of a location were important for Incan mythology. These examples demonstrate the power that environment held in creating and experiencing Incan myths. Inca symbols Chakana or tree of life *Chakana (or Inca Cross, Chakana) is - according to some modern authors - the three-stepped cross equivalent symbolic of what is known in other mythologies as the Tree of Life, World Tree and so on. Through a central axis a shaman journeyed in trance to the lower plane or Underworld and the higher levels inhabited by the superior gods to enquire into the causes of misfortune on the Earth plane. The snake, puma, and condor are totemic representatives of the three levels. The alleged meaning of the chakana symbol is not supported by scholarly literature. Deployments Mythology served many purposes within the Incan Empire. Mythology could often be used to explain natural phenomena or to give the many denizens of the empire a way of thinking about the world. For example, there is a well-known origin myth that describes how the Incan Empire began at its center in Cusco. In this origin myth, four men and women emerged from a cave near Cusco, and began to settle within the Valley of Cusco, much to the chagrin of the Hualla people who had already been inhabiting the land. The Hualla subsided by growing coca and chili peppers, which the Incans associated with the peoples of the Amazon, whom were perceived to be inferior and wild. The Inca engaged in battle with the Hualla, fighting quite viciously, and eventually the Inca emerged victorious. The myth alleges these first Inca people would plant corn, a mainstay of the Inca diet, on the location where they viciously defeated the Hualla. Thus, the myth continues, the Inca came to rule over the entire Cusco Valley, before eventually going on to conquer much of the Andean world. In creating this myth, the Incans reinforced their authority over the empire. Firstly, by associating the Hualla with plants from the jungle, the Inca's origin myth would have likely caused the listener to think that the Hualla were primitive compared to the superior Inca. Thus, the Inca's defeat of the Hualla and their supposed development of maize based agriculture, supported the notion that the Inca were the rightful stewards of the land, as they were able to make the land productive and tame. These myths were reinforced in the many festivals and rites that were celebrated throughout the Incan Empire. For example, there were corn festivals that were celebrated annually during the harvest. During these festivals the Inca elite were celebrated alongside the corn and the main deity of the Inca, Inti. As such, the myth of original Inca's planting of the corn crop was utilized to associate the ruling Inca elite with the gods, as well as portraying them as being the bringers of the harvest. In this way, the origin myths of the Inca were used to justify the elite position of the Inca within their vast, multiethnic empire. Within the Inca Empire, the Inca held a special status of ‚ÄúInca by Blood‚Äù, that granted them significant privileges over non-Inca peoples. The ability of the Inca to support their elite position was no small feat, given that less than fifty thousand Inca were able to rule over millions of non-Inca peoples. Mythology was an important way by which the Inca were able to justify both the legitimacy of the Inca state, as well as their privileged position with the state. The strategic deployment of Incan mythology did not end after the Incan empire was colonized by the Spanish. In fact, Incan mythology was utilized in order to resist and challenge the authority of the Spanish colonial authorities. Many Incan myths were utilized to criticize the wanton greed of European imperialism. There was widespread killing and rape of women and children in South America by the European soldiers. For example, there are myths among the indigenous people of the former Inca empire that tell the stories of foreigners who come into the Andes and destroy valuable objects. One such myth is the tale of Atoqhuarco amongst the Quechua, which describes how an indigenous woman is destroyed in an act of rebellion against a lascivious foreigner, whom eventually is transformed into a predatory fox. Powerful colonial institutions are also critiqued in some of these myths, with the Catholic Church being frequently lambasted. For example, the story of the Priest and Sexton highlights the hypocrisy and abusive nature of a Catholic Priest and his callous treatment of his indigenous parishioners. As such, these myths show that Inca mythology was strategically deployed to subvert and rebel against Spanish rule in the former Incan Empire. Incan mythology continues to be a powerful force in contemporary Andean communities. After the nations that were once a part of the Incan Empire gained their independence from Spain, many of these nations struggled to find a suitable origin myth to support the legitimacy of their state. In the early twentieth century, there was a resurgence of interest about the indigenous heritage of these new nations. While these references to Inca mythology can be more overt, such as the presence of Inti on the Argentine flag, other references to the Inca mythology can be subtler. For example, in the late twentieth century the Peruvian Revolutionary government made reference to Inca myths about Pachamama, an Inca Mother Earth figure, in order to justify their land distribution programs. Additionally, modern governments continue to make reference to the former Inca Empire in order to support their claims of legitimacy, to the point that there are municipally funded observances of rituals referencing Inca mythology, especially in and around Cusco. The power of Incan mythology resonates in contemporary politics, with politicians like Alejandro Toledo making references to Inca mythology and imagery during their candidacies and tenures. While the Inca Empire may have ceased to exist hundreds of years ago, its vibrant mythology continues to influence life throughout South America today. Animals in Inca Mythology Like other Native American cultures, the Inca society was heavily influenced by the local animal populations, both as food, textile, and transportational sources as well as religious and cultural cornerstones. Many myths and legends of the Inca include or are solely about an animal or a mix of animals and their interactions with the gods, humans, and or natural surroundings. Dogs The Inca bred dogs for hunting and scavenging but rarely for religious purposes. The Huanca people, however, had a much more religious basis for their consumption of dog meat as in Inca mythology Paria Caca, their god, was pictured as feeding solely on dog after he defeated another god, Huallallo Carhuincho, in a skirmish. In some parts of South America the Huanca are referred to as ‚Äúthe dog-eating Huanca‚Äù. This behaviour of eating dog was looked down upon in other parts of the empire. There also exists a city named Alqollacta, or ‚ÄúDog town‚Äù, which contains statues of dogs and are thought to represent the souls of dogs that have died. The people would often save up bones and leave them at the statues so that it would give them a better standing in the afterlife. Dogs were sometimes believed to be able of moving between life and death and also see the soul of the dead. In addition, the Inca believed that unhappy dead souls could visit people in the form of black dogs.The Aymara people of Bolivia were reported to believe that dogs were associated with death and incest. They believed that those who die must cross an ocean to the afterlife in the ear of, or on the nose of, a black dog. Additionally, some sources report that women who sleep alone at night were capable of being impregnated by ghosts which would yield a baby with dog feet. Bears Despite there only being one bear species in South America (the spectacled bear, Tremarctus ornatus), the story of The Bear's Wife and Children is a prominent story among the Inca. The Andean people believed that bears represented the sexual habits of men and women and the girls were warned of ‚Äúbear-rape‚Äù. This story details a bear who disguises himself as a man who subdues a girl and takes her to his cave where he feeds her and takes care of her. Soon after, she bares two half bear half human children. With the help of the children the three are able to escape the cave and return to human society. The bear children are given to the town's priest who attempts to kill the cubs several times (by throwing them off buildings, sending them into the wild, sending them to fight officers) but is only capable of getting the younger bear-child killed. The older bear beats the trials and is sent to fight a damned soul, which he defeats and saves from damnation. The soul gives the bear his estate and wealth and the now fully grown bear man leaves human society as a white dove. This tale could be interpreted as a Native American's plight story against the Hispanic society in which they find them in, which becomes more believable as this folklore become more prominent after the Spanish Conquest. In addition to this story, half bear half human beings called Ukuku are thought to be the only being that are able to bring ice from the top of mountains as they have the intelligence of men but the strength of bears. Ukuku clowns can be seen in the Corpus Christi celebrations of Cuzco where they undergo pilgrimage to a nearby glacier and spend the night on the ice as an initiation of manhood. Foxes The fox did not generally have a good reputation among the Inca or people of the Andes and was seen as an omen. Sacrifices to the gods included a variety of goods and animals, including humans, but were never seen to ever include foxes. Inca mythology contains references to gods being deceived by foxes. In one encounter, the deity Cuniraya Viracocha was angered by a fox and stated that ‚ÄúAs for you, even when you skulk around keeping your distance, people will thoroughly despise you and say ‚ÄòThat fox is a thief!‚Äô. When they kill you they'll carelessly throw you away and your skin too‚Äù. In other narratives, the fox is said to have tried to steal the moon but the moon hugged the fox close which resulted in the spots on the moon. Finally, the fox still plays a role in current Andean society where the howling of a fox in the month of August is perceived as a sign of good luck. The Inca had indigenous names for constellations as well as interstellar clouds (dark nebulae) visible from the Southern hemisphere. The fox (Atoq in quechua) is the name for one dark nebulae in the milky way, and Andean narratives, including Inca ones, may refer to the dark nebulae rather than the animal.  Pre-Inca Andean Beliefs  Prior to the founding of the Inca Empire, there were several other cultures in various areas of Peru with their own beliefs, including cultures of the Chav√≠n, Paracas, Moche, and Nazca. Additional pre-Inca beliefs can be found in the Huarochir√≠ Manuscript, a 17th-century text that records the myths, culture, and beliefs of people in the Huarochir√≠ Province of the Western Andes.

History  Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002. The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt. The name is an ad hoc derivation from the titan Atlas in Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. (The usual form of the word is Atlantean.) The derivation was reflected in the company's logo used from 2011 through to the 2017 re-branding through a blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky. Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira ‚Äì a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co- create content, and share documents and other media assets. In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners. In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before. In August 2011, Jay Simons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as \\"co-chief executive\\". For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013. In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London‚Äîthough the actual headquarters remained in Sydney. Atlassian has nine offices in six countries: Amsterdam, Austin, New York, San Francisco and Mountain View, California, Manila, Yokohama, Bangalore, and Sydney. The group has over 3,000 employees serving more than 130,000 customers and millions of users. In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million, and Shona Brown was added to its board. On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange, under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalisation of Atlassian at $4.37 billion. The IPO made its founders Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes Australia's first tech startup billionaires and household names in their native country, despite Atlassian being called a \\"very boring software company\\" in The New York Times for its focus development and management software. In March 2019, Atlassian's value was US$26.6 billion. Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar own approximately 30 percent each.  Sales setup  Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team, relying instead on its website and its partner channel.  Acquisitions and product announcements  In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration. In May 2012, Atlassian Marketplace was introduced as a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products. That same year Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server. Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007. In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012. In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support. Sourcetree is a Git and Mercurial desktop client for developers on Mac or Windows. In 2015 it announced its acquisition of work chat company Hall, with the intention of migrating all of Hall's customers across to its own chat product HipChat. A small startup called Dogwood Labs in Denver, Colorado which had a product called StatusPage was acquired in July 2016. In January 2017 Atlassian announced the purchase of Trello for $425 million. On 7 September 2017 the company launched Stride, a web chat alternative to Slack. Less than a year later, on 26 July 2018, Atlassian announced it was going to exit the chat business, that it had sold the intellectual property for HipChat and Stride to competitor Slack, and that it was going to shut down HipChat and Stride in 2019. As part of the deal, Atlassian took a small stake in Slack. On 4 September 2018 the company acquired OpsGenie for $295 million. On 18 March 2019, the company announced that it had acquired Agilecraft for $166 million. On 25 April 2019, AgileCraft was rebranded as Jira Align.

It was the largest school board in Quebec, and was created on June 9, 1846, at the same time as a Protestant school commission, which became the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. When Quebec's religious \\"confessional\\" school boards were replaced by linguistic ones in 1998, the French-language schools and the board's headquarters were turned over to the Commission scolaire de Montr√©al and its English-language schools to the English Montreal School Board. In 1847, the board had 377 pupils. By 1917, this number increased to 75,000 students. The first kindergarten was established in 1914. An alliance of Catholic teachers was founded in 1919. Primary education is established during the 1920s. During the 1930s, the MCSC began to distribute milk to students and the first school for the disabled opened. Teachers threatened to strike in 1945. Union activist L√©o Guindon was dismissed by the commission in 1948. In January 1949, a long strike paralyzed the board. The English sector of the MCSC became independent in 1963. In 1964, the Ministry of Education of Quebec was established, reducing the authority of boards and religious leaders in the school system. The school population reached a peak in 1970 with 229,000 pupils and 400 schools. The commissioners were originally appointed, but were elected for the first time in 1973. In 1981, the Levesque government of Ren√© L√©vesque restricted access of the clergy to the schools. In 1982, the commissioners introduced a program of sexuality education. In 1990, the committee adopted a policy to promote the use of French. In 1996, when the district celebrated its 150th anniversary, it had a total of 130,000 students; of them 90,000, including 80,000 in the French-language schools and 10,000 in the English-language schools, were in the public school system. The district served Montreal, C√¥te Saint-Luc, Hampstead, Montr√©al-Nord, and Westmount.\\"Presentation of the CECM.\\" Montreal Catholic School Commission. October 31, 1996. Retrieved on March 20, 2011. As of 1996, the district had 229 French-language schools, including 150 elementary schools, 35 secondary schools, and 28 special schools (some operated adult education programmes, some operated vocational and technical programmes). The English-language schools included 20 elementary schools, 8 secondary schools, and five special schools. The district had 13 special schools for students with handicaps, disabilities, and behavioral problems. The district classified 40% of its enrollment as \\"multiethnic.\\"  The end of the MCSC  Groups such as the Committee for Neutral Schools opposed religious schools and religious school boards. In the 1990s, a secular group called the Mouvement la√Øque qu√©b√©cois began a class action lawsuit against the board, and two political parties competed for power within the MCSC: the religious Regroupement scolaire confessionnel led by Michel Pallascio (RSM) et the secular Mouvement pour une √©cole moderne et ouverte la√Øciste (MEMO) headed by Diane De Courcy. The MCSC and the other confessional school boards were abolished on July 1, 1998 by the Marois reform which secularized the public schools in Montreal and created linguistic school boards. The MCSC's last chairperson was Yves Archambault. Most schools in the French-speaking sector went to the Commission scolaire de Montr√©al and those in the English-speaking sector went to the English Montreal School Board. Some schools in the eastern portion of the MCSC were transferred to the Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'√éle (CSP√é), which had replaced the Commission scolaire J√©r√¥me-Le Royer.Lagac√©, Roger. \\"L‚Äô√©cole Calixa Lavall√©e: depuis plus de 40 ans √† Montr√©al-Nord.\\" M√©tro (Canadian newspaper). 14 January 2015.

It is thought that Leonardo da Vinci drew this self-portrait at about the age of 60. The portrait has been extensively reproduced and has become an iconic representation of Leonardo as a polymath or \\"Renaissance Man\\". Despite this, some historians and scholars disagree as to the true identity of the sitter. Description and provenance The portrait is drawn in red chalk on paper. It depicts the head of an elderly man in three-quarter view, his face turned towards the viewer. The subject is distinguished by his long hair and long waving beard which flow over the shoulders and chest. The length of the hair and beard is uncommon in Renaissance portraits and suggests, as now, a person of sagacity. The face has a somewhat aquiline nose and is marked by deep lines on the brow and pouches below the eyes. It appears as if the man has lost his upper front teeth, causing deepening of the grooves from the nostrils. The eyes of the figure do not engage the viewer but gaze ahead, veiled by the long eyebrows. The drawing has been drawn in fine unique lines, shadowed by hatching and executed with the left hand, as was Leonardo's habit. The paper has brownish \\"fox marks\\" caused by the accumulation of iron salts due to moisture. It is housed in Turin, at the Royal Library, and is not generally viewable by the public due to its fragility and poor condition. Researchers have developed a nondestructive way to gauge the condition of the drawing by describing and quantifying the chromophores affecting the paper. Their technique, described in Applied Physics Letters (2014), will be used to assess the rate at which the image is deteriorating and should help with planning appropriate conservation strategies. History and attribution The drawing is estimated to have been drawn c. 1510, possibly as a self-portrait by Leonardo da Vinci. In 1839, it was acquired by King Carlo Alberto of Savoy. The assumption that the drawing is a self-portrait of Leonardo was made in the 19thcentury, based on the similarity of the sitter to the possible portrait of Leonardo as Plato in Raphael's The School of Athens and on the high quality of the drawing, consistent with others by Leonardo. It was also decreed to be a self-portrait based on its likeness to the frontispiece portrait of Leonardo in Vasari's second edition of The Lives of the Artists (1568). During World War II, the presumed self-portrait was temporarily moved from Turin to Rome to avoid being taken by the Nazis, becoming somewhat damaged in the process. In 2000, Frank Z√∂llner reflected that \\"This red chalk drawing has largely determined our idea of Leonardo's appearance for it was long taken to be his only authentic self-portrait.\\"Frank Z√∂llner, Leonardo da Vinci, Taschen (2000) Since the mid-to-late 20th century, the identification of the drawing as a self-portrait has been questioned. The claim that it represents Leonardo has been criticized by a number of Leonardo scholars and experts, such as Robert Payne, Martin Kemp, Pietro Marani, Carlo Pedretti, Larry J. Feinberg, and Martin Clayton. A frequent criticism made in the late 20thcentury is that the drawing depicts a man of a greater age than Leonardo himself achieved, as he died at the age of 67 and allegedly made the drawing between the age of 58 and 60. It has been suggested that the sitter represents Leonardo's father Piero da Vinci or his uncle Francesco, based on the fact they both had a long life and lived until the age of 80. In the early 21st century, the presumed self- portrait of Leonardo was used to help identify the subject of a drawing by Giovanni Ambrogio Figino, believed to depict an elderly Leonardo with his right arm assuaged by cloth. This may correspond with accounts of Leonardo's right hand being paralytic late in life and the burial position of his presumed remains,Charlier, Philippe; Deo, Saudamini. physical sign of stroke sequel on the skeleton of Leonardo da Vinci?\\". Neurology. 4 April 2017; 88(14): 1381‚Äì82 which scientists hope to DNA test to determine if they are Leonardo's. Other portraits Red chalk drawing attributed to Leonardo's pupil Francesco Melzi Other portraits of Leonardo by himself and other hands exist, presenting a different image of Leonardo to the man as represented in the red chalk drawing. Another red chalk drawing, a profile portrait at Windsor, is attributed to his pupil Francesco Melzi. A sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of Leonardo's studies (c. 1517) has also been determined to be a portrait. A self-portrait from Leonardo's Codex on the Flight of Birds depicts the artist at age 53. Leonardo may have also included a self-portrait in Luca Pacioli's Divina proportione, which he illustrated.Shana Priwer, Cynthia Phillips (2005). 101 things you didn't know about Da Vinci: the secrets of the world's most eccentric and innovative genius revealed! Adams Media; pp. 167‚Äì168. A 1471 painting of Gabriel bears an inscription indicating that it is a self-portrait of Leonardo; this would be the earliest depiction of the artist. Leonardo is thought to be portrayed as Plato in Raphael's The School of Athens (1511). He may have been the model for two works by his master Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David (c. 1476) in the Bargello, and the archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel (c. 1475). Donato Bramante's Heraclitus and Democritus (1477) is thought by some to portray Leonardo as Heraclitus. Some suspect that the lower-right attendant in Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi (1481) may be a self-portrait. A 1505 engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi may portray Leonardo playing a lira da braccio, but this has yet to be verified. There is no scholarly consensus on the attribution of the Lucan portrait to Leonardo, but it has at least on occasion been attributed to him. The engraving portrait by Raffaello Morghen and statue by Luigi Pampaloni were made after his lifetime. Romantic paintings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Fran√ßois-Guillaume M√©nageot and other French artists, as well as Angelica Kauffman depict the legendary account of Leonardo's death in the hands of King Francis I of France.

It gained specialism in modern languages since 1996 and became an academy in September 2012. The school's executive headmistress is Mrs Louise McGowan. History The Religious of Jesus and Mary, who originated in France, were invited by Cardinal Manning to open a convent school in Willesden. The school's foundation stone was laid in 1888 and the Convent of Jesus and Mary opened as a private boarding school for girls, although boarding was scrapped at the outbreak of World War II.School profile, cjmlc.co.uk; accessed 11 February 2020. It was the first of three convent schools established by the Sisters in the present-day borough; the second convent school is now the local parish infant school.School profile, connectedup.com; accessed 11 February 2020. During the era of the tripartite system, the convent was unique as it operated as a bilateral school offering both grammar and secondary modern streams. During the 1950s-60s, the school went through a period of major redevelopment. In 1952, as with many Catholic schools across the country, it joined the state sector as a voluntary aided school and maintained this status until April 2012 when the school converted to an academy. A number of Catholic schools nearby were reorganised into primary/junior and infant schools and their senior pupils were all transferred to the Convent. The main Convent itself was split in two as younger pupils were transferred to the second convent school (now Convent of Jesus and Mary Infant School). It became a comprehensive in 1966 with the abolition of the tripartite system in the borough. Today the school continues to serve the Catholic community in the borough and welcomes girls of all faiths or none. The school is a diverse community with around three- quarters of the students coming from minority ethnic groups. Roughly a third of students are of Afro-Caribbean heritage or other Black backgrounds. Achievements In recent times the school has been awarded accolades such as the International School Award in 2008. In 2009, the school was rated \\"outstanding\\" in both the Ofsted and Diocesan inspection reports.

When Richardson arrived at the school in 1985 only 8% of pupils left with more than 5A*-C GCSEs; this rose to 61% on her retirement in 1999. She was succeeded by Ms Hartigan, who was replaced by Mrs Freear. The current head is Mrs Louise McGowan. Academic results GCSE examinations in 1997, 1998, and 1999 were ranked well above average compared with all schools and for 1999 very high compared to similar schools. In 1997 and 1998 they were ranked average compared to all schools and below average in 1999. In 1999 61% of pupils gained 5A*-C. However the proportion of students attaining grades A-C was below the national average. In 2008 60% of pupils achieved at least one A*-C in a modern foreign language. In 2009 76% of pupils achieved 5A*-C. 63% of pupils received a GCSE before being in year 11 and 63% of A levels pupils received A-C and 95.4% A-E.

The plant is located in Lancaster, California. As of mid-August, 2018, the two towers that were the center of the facility are no longer standing. The plant, however, is still present.  Project overview  The Sierra SunTower facility was based on power tower CSP technology. The plant featured an array of heliostats which reflected solar radiation to a tower-mounted thermal receiver. The concentrated solar energy boiled water in the receiver to produce steam. The steam was piped to a turbine generator which converted the energy to electricity. The steam coming out of the turbine was condensed and pressurized back into the receiver. In the summer of 2009, eSolar unveiled the 5 MW Sierra SunTower plant, a commercial facility in Lancaster, California, to demonstrate the efficacy of this CSP technology. Sierra SunTower was connected to the Southern California Edison (SCE) grid and, in spring 2010, it was the only commercial CSP tower facility in North America. The project site occupied approximately in an arid valley in the southwestern corner of the Mojave Desert at 35¬∞ north latitude, on private farm land.Mernit, Judith Lewis. A solar plant a tortoise could love High Country News, 10 August 2009. Accessed: 9 January 2011. Sierra SunTower included two modules. 24,000 heliostats, divided between four sub-fields, tracked the sun and focused its energy onto two tower-mounted receivers. The focused heat converted feedwater piped to the receivers into superheated steam that drove a reconditioned 1947 GE turbine generator to produce electricity. The steam passed through a steam condenser, reverted to water through cooling, and the process repeated. The Sierra SunTower power plant During the 12 months of construction, Sierra SunTower created over 300 temporary jobs. During operation, the site employed 21 permanent employees. At the plant‚Äôs official unveiling, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger praised the eSolar solution, ‚Äú...proving that California‚Äôs energy and environmental leadership are advancing carbon-free, cost-effective energy that can be used around the world.‚Äù Sierra SunTower was certified by the California Energy Commission as a renewable energy facility. Power from the facility was sold under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with SCE, with a projected maximum output sufficient to power approximately 4,000 homes. The 5 MW output from Sierra SunTower displaced CO2 emissions by 7,000 tons per year, an amount equivalent to planting of trees, removing 1,368 automobiles from the road, or saving 650,000 gallons of gasoline. Sierra SunTower was designed to validate eSolar's technology at full scale, effectively eliminating scaleup risks, and to serve as a model from which future plants of this type would be built. However, in 2015, the Sierra SunTower was shut down for commercial operation, as it was deemed to be too costly to operate except on the sunniest of days. Thus, it served to show the real-world problems, and unpredictable nature, of concentrated solar power.  Awards  In December 2009, editors of Power Engineering magazine selected Sierra SunTower as the winner of the ‚ÄúBest Renewable Project‚Äù. Each year, Power Engineering magazine recognizes the world's best energy projects. The award distinguished Sierra as an exceptional power generation project toward meeting growing global demand. In February 2010, Sierra SunTower won Renewable Energy World‚Äôs ‚ÄúRenewable Project of the Year‚Äù award. The award recognized eSolar's achievements in the clean energy industry by naming Sierra SunTower an exceptional breakthrough in the commercialization of solar thermal technology. Performance data from US Treasury Dept. According to US Treasury Department - Performance Report and Certification Form, the eSolar Sierra SunTower generated 539 MWh (MegaWatt- hour) of electricity from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2011. A total of 539 MWh of gross electrical energy was generated at Sierra during the period Aug 1, 2010 and July 31, 2011. This was approximately 12.6% of the expected power generation of the initial estimate of 4270 MWh.

Adam Striegel, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, found the skull on a field trip to the area, but he mistook the teeth for a fern frond. It was later recognized as a skull by class lecturer Dr. Charles Jones, and was taken to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History for further study. The specific name of the type species honors Adam Striegel. The area where the holotype was discovered was part of the Casselman Formation of the Conemaugh Group. In North American Carboniferous stratigraphy, these strata are early Virgilian in age. According to ICS standards, they are Gzhelian in age. The skull itself was found lying near the base of a road cut that exposes the lower part of the Casselman Formation. The Casselman Formation overlies the Ames Limestone, which represents the last marine submergence of the Appalachian Basin. The earliest portions of the Casselman Formation, consisting of sandstones and siltstones, are overbank levee deposits that were formed at the shoreline of the retreating Ames Sea. Overlying these deposits is the Grafton Sandstone, a cross-bedded channel-phase sandstone deposited by a meandering river. Above the sandstone lies the Birmingham Shale, which includes fine-grained siltstone and shale overbank deposits. A thick paleosol is present at the top of the Birmingham Shale, and it is capped by limestone that is of freshwater lacustrine (lake) origin. The holotype skull likely came from the limestone that caps the Birmingham Shale or the underlying paleosol. Because it was not found in situ, the horizon in which the skull originated cannot be determined definitively. The gray limestone matrix that is found inside the skull has been examined by geochemical X-ray reflectance analyses. However, these analyses were not able to determine the stratigraphic origin of the skull. Carbonate nodules at the base of the Clarksburg Member and the limestone capping the Birmingham Shale were the most likely sources of the skull based on these analyses, although chemical dissimilarities with the skull matrix existed in both these strata. According to the original describers of Fedexia, the carbonate nodules of the Clarksburg Member were an unlikely source because of biogenic disturbances and an abundance of siliciclastic material. The holotype skull is long and is uncrushed and well preserved. Remarkably, the stapes, or middle ear bone, remains intact. Also preserved are both mandibles and the atlas-axis complex, which connects to the base of the skull. Description Fedexia possesses several characteristics that identify it as a trematopid. One of the most noticeable is a greatly elongated and subdivided external naris. The posterior portion of the naris may have held a salt gland. Another characteristic is the presence of large palatal tusks. Based on small bony elements present in the related trematopid Anconastes, Fedexia likely had a granular skin texture formed by bony protuberances. These protuberances would have served as protection from predators and would have lessened water loss through the skin. Unlike other trematopids, Fedexia has a tall, arching lateral profile to the skull. The margin forms a broad arc from the tip of the snout to the occipital region. Other trematopids have a lower, straighter profile to the skull. Another distinguishing feature is that the postorbital length, from the eyes to the back of the skull, is greater than the preorbital length, from the eyes to the tip of the snout. The orbits, or eye sockets, are vertically elongated, extending dorsally to the skull table. There is also a small notch on the premaxilla that separates the premaxillary teeth from the maxillary teeth. Classification Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relations of Fedexia, from Berman et al., 2010: Paleobiology Like all trematopids, Fedexia was well adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Trematopids are the earliest examples of vertebrate life in North America that lived mostly on land, although they likely returned to the water to mate and lay eggs. Fedexia is one of the oldest known vertebrates to have been primarily terrestrial rather than aquatic. Even older are the trematopids Actiobates and Anconastes, which are Missourian (Kasimovian) and early Virgilian in age, respectively. The shift toward a terrestrial lifestyle may have been a response to the warmer and drier global climate that existed during the late Carboniferous. During this time, glaciation caused the climate to rapidly fluctuate and sea levels to drop. This resulted in a loss of coal swamps that were once common at higher latitudes. Fedexia was an early example of adaptation to the changing climate. It is possible that terrestrial trematopids existed for a few million years prior to Fedexia, Actiobates, and Anconastes. Earlier trematopids may have inhabited upland regions, and would have later immigrated to lowland and coastal regions as the climate continued to change. Some 20 million years after the appearance of Fedexia, during the Permian period, trematopids and other terrestrial vertebrates experienced rapid diversification.

Originally under traditional Indigenous Australian ownership, the area became a pastoral lease in the late 19th century and for many years operated as a cattle station. It is traversed by the Stuart Highway, built in the 1940s along the route of the service track for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. It is also crossed by the Amadeus Gas Pipeline built in the mid-1980s, and the Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway, completed in early 2004. Muckaty Station was returned to its Indigenous custodians in 1999. The area comprises semi-arid stony ridges, claypans and a stony plateau, and experiences a sub- tropical climate, with a wet season between January and March. The vegetation is mostly scrubland, including spinifex grasslands. The fauna is generally typical of Australian desert environments, and includes the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo, the northern nail-tail wallaby, and the spinifex hopping mouse. A site within Muckaty was being considered for Australia's low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste storage and disposal facility. Indigenous custodians of Muckaty Station were divided over the proposal, which also met resistance from environmental organisations and the Northern Territory government. The plan was abandoned after a Federal Court of Australia case in 2014. History alt=An old wooden telegraph pole standing in a semi-desert grassland plain with low scrub in the distance Indigenous Australians have lived in parts of the Northern Territory for around 40,000 years. Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at \\"well over 10,000\\".Langfield 2001, p. 4. The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just \\"Muckaty\\", though the origin of this name and near variants such as \\"Mucketty\\" is unknown) was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì the responsibility of seven clans of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa.Gray 1997, pp. 17‚Äì37. The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.Gray 1997; Nash 1992, pp. 2‚Äì3. Although there had been several unsuccessful attempts by British or colonial authorities to settle in the Northern Territory, there was no permanent European presence until surveyor George Goyder in 1869 established what is now known as Darwin.Carment 1996, pp. 2‚Äì4. The timing was auspicious: in October 1870 the South Australian government decided to construct an overland telegraph line, from Port Augusta on the continent's south coast, to the new settlement just established in the country's tropical north.Carment 1996, p. 4. The line traversed what is now Muckaty Station, with repeater stations built at Powell's Creek to the north and Tennant's Creek to the south.Shepherd 1996, p. 43. At the same time as the telegraph line was completed in August 1872,Carment 1996, p. 5. a cattle industry was beginning to develop in central and northern Australia. The first pastoral lease in the Northern Territory was granted in 1872, and by 1911 there were at least 250 such leases covering over of the jurisdiction.Ling 2009, p. 29. The Muckaty pastoral lease was created in the late 19th century.Nash 1992. Currently the property is surrounded by other leases including Powell Creek to the north, Helen Springs Station to the east with Philip Creek and Banka Banka Stations to the south. In the 1930s, the Australian government was sufficiently concerned about the condition and lack of development of these leases that it held two inquiries between 1932 and 1938. Historian Ted Ling's accounts of those inquiries, however, make no mention of Muckaty, which was not singled out for comment by either investigation.Ling 2009; Ling 2010. Throughout the history of Australia's pastoral industry, Indigenous Australians were a major part of the workforce. In 1928 for example, 80 per cent of Indigenous people with jobs were employed on the stations, including Muckaty, with many living on and travelling across the pastoral leases.Gray 1997, p. 57.McLaren and Cooper 2001, pp. 162‚Äì178. The local language, Warlmanpa, was recognised in some publications from the 1930s onward, while anthropologists and administrators made some records of language and population in the region of Muckaty Station. Only one record from the period lists both Muckaty Station as a location and Warlmanpa as a language. A record of Aboriginal wards of the state, it showed only three Indigenous adults living on Muckaty, compared to almost fifty on Banka Banka Station, to the east.Nash 1992, pp. 5‚Äì7. This reflects the fact that, by 1940, \\"Warlmanpa country had been depopulated\\".Nash 1992, p. 5. By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt.Nash 1992, p. 6. The 1940s also marked a significant change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940,McLaren and Cooper 2001, p. 136. before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited.Gray 1997, pp. 3‚Äì4. Between 1985 and 1987 the Amadeus Gas Pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley Gas Field in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.Gray 1997, pp. 5‚Äì8. In 1991, the cattle station was taken over by the Muckaty Aboriginal Corporation. The Corporation focused on rehabilitating the land, which had been degraded by excessive numbers of cattle, and by late 1993 Muckaty had been destocked of cattle for several seasons.Gray 1997, pp. 1, 14. On 20 December 1991, the Northern Land Council lodged a claim over Muckaty on behalf of traditional owners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. The claim was made by members of the seven groups that each has responsibility for different sites and dreamings in the area.Gray 1997, p. 17. In 1997, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner recommended that Muckaty Station be handed back to the traditional owners,Gray 1997, p. 70. and in February 1999, title to the land was returned. At the time there were about 400 formal traditional owners, among 1,000 people with traditional attachments to the land; some lived on the station, but others were elsewhere in the region, including in the nearby towns of Tennant Creek and Elliott. As Aboriginal Freehold land it is inalienable communal title, and cannot be bought or sold.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009b, p. 43. The pastoral lease holder and manager of the station since 1997 has been Ray Aylett. The Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway, which passes through the western part of Muckaty Station, was completed in early 2004. Geology and geography alt=straight railway tracks bisect a grassy plain with red soil Muckaty Station covers an area of and lies north of Tennant Creek, in Australia's Northern Territory. It includes a homestead that lies west of the Stuart Highway and east of the railway.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, p. 30. The residence has associated cattle yards, an airstrip, and workers' accommodation. It is adjacent to Banka Banka Station to the east, and Powell Creek Station (also referred to as an outstation) to the north.Gray 1997, p. 3. The climate is subtropical, with a wet season between January and March, during which the area receives monthly rainfall of between . For the rest of the year there is usually less than of rain each month.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, p. 82. The station's geology is dominated by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some claystone and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, p. 77. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include claypans, while to the west are stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek,Gray 1997, p. 14. and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station. The region is semi-arid, and the vegetation is generally scrubland. Muckaty Station lies at the boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with a canopy of bloodwood trees.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, p. 83. Most of the region's fauna is typical of desert environments. Species include the red kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo (also known as the euro), the northern nail- tail wallaby, and the spinifex hopping mouse. The central pebble-mound mouse also occurs in the region, and other mammal species including the Forrest's mouse, desert mouse and short-beaked echidna have been predicted by biologists to occur on the station.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, pp. 83‚Äì84. The station may lie within the range of the critically endangered night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis). There is relatively high diversity and abundance of reptiles, including the military dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis gularis) and the sand goanna (Varanus gouldii flavirufus).Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, p. 84. Radioactive waste facility The search for a site at which to dispose of or store Australia's low and intermediate-level radioactive wastes commenced in 1980. A formal public process of site selection that had commenced in 1991 finally failed in 2004. On 7 December 2005, the Australian government passed legislation, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act, to facilitate the siting of a radioactive waste facility in the Northern Territory. Section four of the Act allowed the Australian government to schedule potential sites for a waste facility, and three Northern Territory sites were proposed under the legislation. Following criticisms made by the Northern Land Council, in December 2006 the legislation was revised to also allow Aboriginal Land Councils to nominate potential sites for a facility. In May 2007 the Northern Land Council, on behalf of Ngapa clan traditional owners, nominated a small area within Muckaty Station (for which the Ngapa had traditional responsibility) to be considered as a possible site for the facility. In September 2007, the government accepted the nomination, bringing the total number of possible sites to four. The Government of the Northern Territory opposed the nomination, but could not prevent it. Ngapa clan members volunteered a area to be considered for the facility, which was expected to require 1 square kilometre of land. A parliamentary inquiry and media reports indicated that the Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that some members of the Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump. In 2009, the Australian government received a consultant's report that examined Muckaty Station as one of four possible sites for a nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory.Parsons Brinckerhoff 2009, pp. ii, 1, 77‚Äì88. The report was released in 2010. In February 2012, the Muckaty Station site was the only one under consideration by the government. Legal action In 2010, Mark Lane Jangala and other traditional owners instructed law firms Maurice Blackburn, Surry Partners (a firm that includes human rights lawyer George Newhouse), and lawyer Julian Burnside to commence legal proceedings against the Northern Land Council and the Australian government in the Federal Court of Australia to stop the nomination of Muckaty Station as a nuclear waste storage facility. The Federal Court challenge was due to commence early in 2013 before Justice Tony North, who handled the Tampa affair. According to a June 2012 report in The Age, some indigenous owners would \\"testify they were never consulted, while others [will] say that they were not properly consulted and never consented to the nomination\\". The court did not begin hearing the case until 2 June 2014, for what was expected to be a five-week trial. However, on 18 June, the Northern Land Council withdrew the nomination of Muckaty as part of a legal settlement between the parties. The Australian government indicated there would be a three-month period during which the Northern Land Council and traditional owners could determine whether they wished to nominate an alternative site for the dump elsewhere on Muckaty Station.

Intromittent organs are found most often in terrestrial species, as most non-mammalian aquatic species fertilize their eggs externally, although there are exceptions. For many species in the animal kingdom, the male intromittent organ is a hallmark characteristic of internal fertilization. Species with intromittent organs=InvertebratesMolluscs= Male cephalopods have a specialized arm, the hectocotylus, which is inserted into the female's mantle cavity to deliver a spermatophore during copulation. In some species, the hectocotylus breaks off inside the female's mantle cavity; in others, it can be used repeatedly to copulate with different females. =Arachnids= In spiders the intromittent organs are the male pedipalps, even though these are not primarily sexual organs, but serve as indirect mating organs; in the male the pedipalps have hollow, clubbed tips, often of complex internal anatomy. The sexually mature male typically deposits his semen onto a specially woven silken mat, then sucks the emission into his pedipalps. In mating, he inserts the openings of the pedipalps in turn into the epigyne, the female external genital structure. In Solifugae sperm transfer is also indirect; the male deposits a spermatophore on the ground, picks it up in his chelicerae, then inserts it into the female's genital opening. In Opiliones (harvestmen), males have a structure called a penis, which is not present in other arachnids. =Millipedes= In most millipedes, sperm-transfer is performed by one or two pair of modified legs called gonopods, which are often on the seventh body segment. During mating, a male bends his body to collect a spermatophore from the genital pore of his third segment, and inserts it into the females body. Gonopods vary greatly among millipedes, and are often used to identify species. =Insects= Male insects possess an aedeagus, whose function is directly analogous to that of the vertebrate penis. Some insects also have claspers. Male moths have an additional organ called the juxta, which supports the aedeagus. These however are generalisations, and insect genitalia vary enormously in anatomy and in application. For example, some insects, most notoriously the Cimicidae and some Strepsiptera practise traumatic insemination, in which the intromittent organ pierces the abdominal wall and the semen is deposited into the hemocoel. VertebratesFish= Gonopodium of a black molly (Poecilia sphenops). In male members of Chondrichthyes (sharks and rays), as well as now-extinct placoderms, the pelvic fins bear specialized claspers. During copulation, one clasper is inserted into the female's cloaca, and sperm is flushed by the male's body through a groove into the female. Members of Poeciliidae are small fishes that give birth to live young. In males, the anal fin is shaped into a grooved, rod-shaped organ called a gonopodium used to deliver sperm to females. =Tetrapods= In lizards and snakes, males possess paired hemipenes, each of which is usually grooved to allow sperm transport and spiny or rough at the tip to allow firm attachment to the female. To become erect, a hemipenis is evaginated (turned inside out) through muscle action and engorgement with blood. Only one is inserted into the female's cloaca at a time. In reptiles, the phallus has an open sulcus instead of a closed urethral tube.Gredler, Marissa L., et al. \\"Evolution of external genitalia: insights from reptilian development.\\" Sexual Development 8.5 (2014): 311-326. In some turtles, crocodiles, some birds, and in all mammals, males possess a penis centered along the midline of the body. During copulation it becomes erect due to engorgement with blood or lymph, though in many animals it also contains a stiff or even bony support structure. When not in use, its soft penile tissue is usually flaccid, and depending on the species, may be retracted into the body. The anatomy of the penis varies widely according to species. However, the penis evolved only once in the evolutionary history of amniotes. In male caecilians, the intromittent organ is called the phallodeum. Mammals Baculum of a dog (Canis lupus familiaris). All male mammals have a penis. Insectivores, bats, rodents, carnivorans, and most primates (but not humans) have a bone called the baculum or os penis that permanently stiffens the penis. During copulation, blood engorges the already-stiff penis resulting in a full erection. Monotreme penes are variously unusual; the platypus has a penis with a two-lobed (bifid) tip though the whole shaft is inserted in mating, possibly to engage both of the uterine branches, but the echidna's penis actually has four heads, only two of which function at a time. Both monotremes and marsupial moles are the only mammals with internal penises, located on the cloacal wall instead of outside of it as in other mammals.Gadow, H. On the systematic position of Notoryctes typhlops. Proc. Zool. Soc. London 1892, 361‚Äì370 (1892). Most marsupial penises are variously forked or split into two in such ways that they resemble hemipenes; in different marsupial species their forms are characteristic enough to be taxonomically important. Birds Although birds reproduce through internal fertilization, 97% of males completely lack a functional intromittent organ. For the 3% of birds with an intromittent organ, copulation occurs through brief insertion of the male organ into the vagina before ejaculation. Alternatively, for the vast majority of birds‚Äîa group comprising nearly 10,000 species ‚Äîsperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in a maneuver known as the ‚Äúcloacal kiss‚Äù. Birds are one of the only groups which reproduce through internal fertilization but have repeatedly lost the intromittent organ. Male ostriches have a conical shaped penis that is wider at the base. A functional intromittent organ is known to be present in most species of Paleognathae and Anseriformes. The Anseriformes (waterfowl) are a particularly interesting group to study given the high variability in intromittent organ morphology. Waterfowl intromittent organs range greatly in length, are often characterized by surface elaborations (both spines and grooves), and at times spiral counter-clockwise. Male ducks have a penis that is coiled along the ventral wall of the cloaca when flaccid and which may have an elaborate spiral shape when erect. Waterfowl intromittent organ variation is most likely due to an intersexual arms race resulting from a mating system in which forced extra-pair copulations are frequent.

Allen (September 5, 1821 ‚Äì April 24, 1884) was an industrial businessman, an officer in the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the auger and hoe business, selling mainly to the American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62. Early life Allen was the son of John and Sarah Allen. His father was a native of Connecticut and of English origin, and his mother was originally from Vermont and of Scottish descent. He left home when he was eight years old \\"to carve out a fortune for himself\\", as Sylvester put it in his History of Rensselaer County, New York. He began work in an auger factory in Hamden, Connecticut, at an early age and continued until he was seventeen years old. At that time, he purchased a clock store, which he traded for horses in Vermont and Canada. He shipped his horses to the West Indies, but the ship was wrecked and his horses were lost, thus placing him badly in debt. However, he soon obtained credit, and again shipped a number of horses to the West Indies, this time successfully, enabling him to pay all his debts and even earning him a profit.Sylvester (1880), p. 544 Before the war Allen soon resumed his place in the auger factory in Connecticut, where he remained until September 1, 1843, when he moved to Troy, New York. There he entered into partnership with O. W. Edson in manufacturing augers. The partnership continued until the following January when Allen purchased his partner's share and continued in this business until the factory burned down in 1850. Allen's factory can be seen west of the Poesten Kill and north of the bridge in this 1876 map. His residence is also in the northwest corner. In January 1851, Allen purchased the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial building in the area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory had a long history of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.Anderson (1896), pp. 524‚Äì525 The factory was located on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was commonly used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an auger and bit factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. But the company soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.Sylvester (1880), pp. 542‚Äì543 Allen reopened the company in 1859, having added machinery for the manufacture of hoes, and opened a retail store on site. He found a successful market in the South, where demand was high. His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand dropped and sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army. Public and armed service Allen's home in Eagle Mills, which still stands today Allen's presence was noticeable within Brunswick. In March 1853, he presided over a meeting to incorporate the \\"Church of the Disciples of Christ at the village of Millville\\", now known simply as Church of the Disciples of Christ. That summer, a church building was erected at a cost of about $1,200.Weise (1880), p. 105 In 1856 Allen became the supervisor of Brunswick, a position he was reelected to once and held until 1857; he ran as a Whig.Paine (1883), p. 74Anderson (1897), p. 529 He was also elected justice of the peace in 1861,Anderson (1897), p. 530 but he did not finish his term because he decided to serve in the Civil War; this time he ran as a Democrat, and remained one for the rest of his life. In early 1862, the 125th Volunteer Infantry Regiment had been put together in Brunswick and a call by President Lincoln for more troops was answered by Allen that September. He enlisted in Company C of the 169th New York Volunteer Infantry and was chosen captain, having organized the company within six days. Most of the infantrymen came from Brunswick, though some came from surrounding towns. Residents of the town raised the money necessary to cover various \\"bounties and expenses\\" incurred by Allen's soldiers while en route to war.Anderson (1897), p. 524 Allen participated in all the battles in which his regiment took part except a few minor ones, due to wounds he received in battle. During the Battle of Cold Harbor, the bones in his wrist were shattered, and he later incurred a flesh wound in the same wrist at the First Battle of Fort Fisher. He was also wounded in the leg near his ankle at Fort Fisher; the musket ball remained there until his death. While recovering from injuries, he was reassigned to New York to recruit new soldiers. He was promoted to the rank of major in June 1864, and, for \\"meritorious conduct\\" at Fort Fisher, he was recommended for promotion by President Lincoln and brevetted lieutenant colonel on March 13, 1865. Post war and personal life Allen returned to Brunswick after the war and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing.

A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.Hayner (1925), p. 104 In addition to holding the offices of justice of the peace and town supervisor, it is also said that Allen was one of the foremost supporters of education in the town. On July 6, 1847, he married Sarah H. Payne, daughter of David H. and Catharine C. Payne, of Hamden, Connecticut. The couple had two children: Sarah and Cornelia May. Allen died on April 24, 1884, and is buried in Eagle Mills Cemetery on Brunswick Road in Eagle Mills; his wife died in 1907 and is buried next to him.Allen Family Gravestone. \\"Col. Joseph H.

History  The Khant subcaste was founded by Koli chief Sonang Mer, who traveled from Sindh to Gujarat. He had twelve sons, one of whom was Dhan Mer, who founded Dhandhuka and Dhandhalpur. His other sons included Patal Khant, who conquered Petlad, and Mer Rana, who conquered Mahiyar in Junagadh. The most famous Koli chief was Jesa Khant, who defeated the Rao Khengarji I of Junagadh with the help of Muhammad bin Tughluq. Khant Kolis is a branch of Mer Kolis.  Rebellion in Junagadh  The rebellion was raised by Mansa Khant against the first Nawab of Junagadh State because the Nawab was Viceroy of Gujarat Sultanate under the Mughal empire. Khant Kolis captured Uparkot Fort and plundered surrounding villages. The Nawab was unable to prevent Kolis, so he sought help from an Arab Jamadar Sheikh Abdullah Zubaidi and Thakur of Gondal State. Their combined forces attacked, captured the troops at the fort, and suppressed the rebellion.  Princely state  The Princely state of Ambliara was ruled by Hindus Khant Kolis of Chauhan dynasty. The rulers were famous for resistance to the troops of Gaekwad Baroda State.  Sant State  The Khant Kolis saved the Sant State from Rajputs of Banswara State. In 1753, Ratana Singh of Sant State died, and Sisodia Rajput ruler of Banswara attacked Sant. He killed three princes, but the fourth prince named Badansingh escaped with Khant Kolis. The Banswara troops were established in Sant and annexed in Banswara. Prince Badansingh was nurtured by Khant Kolis, and when he came of age, Kolis attacked Banswara troops and drove them out of Sant. Afterward, Kolis enthroned Badan Singh as Rana at Sant.

It included Romulo's memories of his parents and the first time he met the Americans in the person of soldiers stationed in Camiling, his native town in Tarlac. The time was during the Philippine War of Independence. The nameless soldier taught Romulo and other Filipino boys how to read and write in English using Edward Baldwin's Primer.

Between 1928 and 1991, it served as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio. Built in 1928 by Italian colonial authorities, much of the building was destroyed in 2008 by al-Shabaab. In 2013, the diocese announced plans to refurbish the building. History Mogadishu Cathedral was built in 1928 by the Italian authorities in the former Italian Somaliland. Known as the Cattedrale di Mogadiscio, it was constructed in a Norman Gothic style, based on the Cathedral of Cefal√π, in Sicily. It was built in nearly six years by the Italian authorities in their former Italian Somaliland, in a central area of the capital not far from the Governor's Palace. Indeed the Cathedral was built as the biggest in eastern Africa by order of Cesare Maria De Vecchi, a catholic governor of \\"Somalia italiana\\" who promoted the \\"Missionari della Consolata\\" christianization of Somali people.The Catholic missionaries of \\"Consolata\\" promoted by governor De Vecchi (in Italian) It was built between 1923 and 1928 and was used as a model the \\"Cathedral of Cefalu\\" (in northern Sicily), created to commemorate the Christian reconquest of Sicily from the Arabs in the X century. The Cathedral was done in \\"Norman\\" Gothic style, designed by architect Antonio Vandone. The facade, with an impressive appearance, was delimited to the sides by two towers, each 37.50 meters high. The plan of the building was a Latin cross; inside was divided into three naves separated by piers with pointed arches.Religious ceremony inside the naves The church was entrusted to the \\"Consolata\\" missionaries, then replaced by the Franciscans (Friars Minor). The altar had a huge statue -done by sculptor Cesare Biscarra- of the Virgin Mary of Consolata,Statue & decorations inside the Mogadiscio Cathedral that looked at the parishioners in an impressive way like a statue of Roman Gods inside an ancient imperial temple.Image of the Virgin Mary over the Altar In 1989, on the eve of the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia, the last Bishop of Mogadishu, Salvatore Colombo, was killed by armed insurgents while celebrating Mass in the cathedral.La fede negata, aricolo dell'\\"Avvenire\\" Current situation What remained of the Catholic Cathedral in 2011 After 1991, the cathedral was no longer regularly used. In late 2008, much of the Catholic cathedral was destroyed.Articolo del Giornale, 3 ottobre 2008 A BBC correspondent later visited the site in 2012 and reported that some internally displaced people had formed tent settlements on the cathedral grounds. This was in stark contrast to the many new shops that had opened outside, where merchants, optimistic about the city's relative stability since the ousting of the insurgents, had begun to publicly advertise their wares again. The correspondent also mentioned that although the cathedral had structurally incurred considerable damage by having its roof blown off among other things, its walls were still erect, its elegant stone arches still in place, and the general atmosphere was one of serenity.Somalia's Graveyard of Grand and Beautiful Buildings In April 2013, after a visit to the site to inspect its condition, the Diocese announced plans to rebuild the cathedral in the future.

He was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His book, Phrase/Paraphrase, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. Guenther translated thousands of poems into English from languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, Eskimo, Greek, German and Hungarian. He corresponded with scores of authors, including Ezra Pound, Kirkwood, Mo. native Marianne Moore, and E. E. Cummings. Ezra Pound, who Guenther met in 1951, was a great influence on Guenther's work, particularly his translations. Guenther also wrote original formal and free verse poetry, in addition to his translations. He was a literary critic for 50 years. Early life Guenther started writing and translating poetry at age 15 while a student at Roosevelt High School in St. Louis, Missouri. In his essay, \\"On the Art of Translation,\\" he said \\"I spent hours in the library reading poetry, especially European poetry, in translation at first and later in the original language.\\" Upon graduation from high school at age 17, Guenther worked as a copy boy for the St. Louis Star- Times. This work, Guenther said, was influential on his experience as a writer. \\"Newspaper people‚Äîthen, anyway‚Äîwere a special and temperamental breed. It exposed you to the human comedy.‚Äù He was a graduate of Harris Teachers College, earned a master's degree at Webster College (now Webster University) and did doctoral work in languages at St. Louis University. Career During World War II he translated information for the U.S. Army Air Corps, tracking such details as the opening and closing of foreign runways. He worked at various times as a historian, librarian and supervisory cartographer for the U.S. Air Force. He was employed at the Aeronautical Chart and Information Center of St. Louis for 30 years. In 1953 Guenther began writing literary reviews for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, retiring from that position in 2003. He also wrote for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat from 1972 to 1982. Guenther said he considered reviewing a \\"civic honor.\\" In his work as a newspaper book critic, he reviewed work by hundreds of authors, such as Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, William Stafford, Mona Van Duyn and Anthony Hecht. Original poetry Charles Guenther was prolific in writing original poetry. He wrote in traditional rhyming verse; while frequently employing free verse. His subjects were varied, from wintry rural scenes \\"Snow Country\\", regional \\"Missouri Woods\\", and nature \\"Spring Catalog\\". The poem \\"Three Faces of Autumn,\\" (from the book Phrase/Paraphrase) is an example of Guenther's sometimes concise, clipped style: > Now sunfire stains the tupelos and the shadows in trapeziums off the > haybarns straggle and gather by rocks and birches where the crickets' still- > fast whirr cries against the closed season (from Part I, \\"Three Faces of Autumn\\") Other poems, like \\"Escalator\\" and \\"Arch\\" were more experimental and avant-garde. Guenther also wrote elegies and poems commemorative of places, people and events. Guenther also worked tirelessly to promote poetry and poets. He was a frequent correspondent and mentored many younger poets. For 15 years he served as Regional Midwest Vice- President for the Poetry Society of America. Translation work Guenther, who translated since his teens, was prolific in translating poetry from roughly a dozen foreign languages. Many poets were translated into English for the first time by Guenther. In an essay entitled \\"Reflections,\\" from the book Three Faces of Autumn,\\" Guenther credits Ezra Pound as an early influence on his work. The two met in 1951 when Guenther visited Pound while he was incarcerated at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. Guenther said, \\"It was the start of a lively correspondence with this fascinating, obstinate poet who had put new vigor into American literature.\\" Guenther was also versatile in his translation work. He translated into English from such varying poets as Edgar Degas, Paul Val√©ry, Pablo Neruda, Salvatore Quasimodo and Dante Alighieri. Guenther also extensively translated the works of Garcilaso de la Vega, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Jules Laforgue and Jean Wahl. Most of his translations and poetry were published in literary publications, including The American Poetry Review, Black Mountain Review, The Formalist and The Kenyon Review Italy in 1973 decorated Guenther with a knighthood with its Commendatore Ordine al Merito della Repubblica (Order of Merit of the Italian Republic). Other nations also honored Guenther for his work in translating their native poets into English, many for the first time. About the work of translation, Guenther wrote, \\"In a great poem there is something magic, a haunting spirit. It's so rare that you keep looking for it.‚Äù In an essay concerning the craft of translation in Guardian of Grief: Poems of Giacomo Leopardi, Guenther claimed most of his translations were ‚Äúreformations,‚Äù recasting ‚Äúa foreign poem into its original form or free verse form.‚Äù Guenther said ‚ÄúMy own practice when translating early poets is to place them in their own time, with a hint of antiquity, avoiding the grossly archaic language of their contemporaries. My purpose is to make a poem from a poem.‚Äù The last stanza of Guenther‚Äôs translation of Giacomo Leopardi's \\"The Calm After the Storm,\\" is an example of the Italian translations for which he was renowned: > O kindly nature, These are your gifts. These are the delights You offer > mortals. It‚Äôs a pleasure For us to be relieved of pain, You spread pain > freely; grief Rises spontaneously; and that bit of joy Which by miracle and > prodigy sometimes Is born of anxiety, it is a great gain. A human Progeny > dear to those eternal ones! You're lucky Indeed if you can breathe again > After some grief: and blessed If death heals every sorrow. In the Introduction to Three Faces of Autumn, Guenther said recognition was important, but ‚ÄúIt is the work, not the prize or the honor, that matters most. The work endures.‚Äù A poem by Jos√© Agust√≠n Goytisolo (entitled \\"The Difficult Poem\\"), which Guenther translated and is the last selection in The Hippopotamus: Selected Translations 1945‚Äì1985, seems to sum up the translation process: > The poem is inside and doesn‚Äôt want to get out. It pounds in my head doesn‚Äôt > want to get out. I shout, I tremble, and it doesn‚Äôt want to get out. I call > it by name and it doesn‚Äôt want to get out. Later down the street it stands > before me.

The space, full of irony, is directed to those men and women born during the Spanish civil war or in the years immediately after, whom he accuses of cowardice and failing in a life burdened by the past. The journalist pessimistic point of views are a reflection of the dissatisfaction he faces in his own life. Jos√© Miguel is separated from his wife, Elena, with whom he has two children, whom he rarely sees.

Now headquarters for the Louisiana Army National Guard, the structure is named for the late Judge James E. Bolin. The Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant, formerly known as the Louisiana Ordnance Plant or as The Shell Plant, is an inactive plant to load, assemble and pack ammunitions items. During production from 1942 to 1994, the Army disposed of untreated explosives-laden wastewater in on-site lagoons, contaminating soil, sediments and groundwater with hazardous chemicals. It is government-owned, contractor-operated facility located off U.S. Highway 80 in Webster Parish near Doyline between Minden and Bossier City, Louisiana. Part of LAAP is known as Camp Minden, a training center for the Louisiana Army National Guard. LAAP and Camp Minden have become nearly interchangeable terms, with most references to Camp Minden. Location The Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant is a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facility located off U.S. Highway 80 in Webster Parish, Louisiana between Minden, Louisiana and Bossier City, Louisiana. History=World War II, 1941-1945 At the beginning of 1939, the government imposed eminent domain to purchase land for the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant (LAAP). Handled by the attorney Harvey Locke Carey of Shreveport, then with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, completed the acquisition in 1941 even before the United States entered World War II.\\"$30 million Shell Plant for Minden\\", Minden Herald, June 6, 1941, p. 1 LAAP was completed in eleven months under the direction of the contractor, Silas Mason. At the time, the entire area was rural and thinly settled. In May 1942, eight production lines were opened. In December 1944, the number of employees peaked at 10,754, the month of the decisive Battle of the Bulge. In the summer of 1945 production ceased with V-J Day, and the plant was deactivated three months later.\\"The History of LAAP\\", lecture at Dorcheat Historical Association Museum, May 13, 2013 In the building of the plant, nine rural cemeteries in Webster and Bossier parishes came uniquely under the perpetual care of the United States government. Existing wooden grave markers were replaced with small concrete slabs without the names of the deceased listed on the markers. The cemeteries are Allentown, Crowe, Jim Davis, Keene, Knotttingham, Raine, Richardson, Vanorsdel, and Walker. Those interred are listed with dates of birth and death and occasionally with other information in a printed survey, but individuals cannot visit LAAP grounds to look for specific graves; none would be found by the names were such a search conducted. The Crowe and Richardson cemeteries have the greatest number of individual grave listings.Clifford D. Cardin, Bossier Parish historian, \\"An In-Depth Study of the Cemeteries and Graves Located in the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant near Minden, Louisiana\\", p. 4 Plant operations, 1951-1975 LAAP was restored to service during the Korean under Remington Rand in 1951, and employment reached 5,000 in 1953. LAAP included a metals forging and machining plant area known as the Y-Line Chromic Acid Etching Facility, which manufactured 155-mm projectiles. The plant was activated once more during the Vietnam War in September 1961 by Sperry Rand, the contractor until 1975. It produced mines, shaped charges, fuzes, boosters, bombs, demolition blocks, projectiles, etc.Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant .n.d. Gobalsecurity.orgaccessed 24 July 2017 During this time there were two tragic accidental explosions in 1962 and again in 1968. LAAP had 7,800 employees at the height of the Vietnam War in 1967.Minden Press- Herald, December 29, 1967, p. 1 The Army had four production areas for classified ammunitions. While in operation, LAAP was like a town unto itself, with its own 20-bed hospital, fire department, telephone line, water wells, sewerage and lighting systems, roads, staff housing, and meal services. The facility was so large that many needed a map to find their way around the grounds. There were major safety and security programs with certain employees designated as \\"guards\\"; to prevent fires employees were forbidden to enter the plant with smoking materials in their possession. Among the plant managers during the Vietnam activation was retired United States Army Colonel Thomas L. Gaines (1901-1989), a native of Dickson County in western Tennessee who fought in both theaters of World War II, left the active military in 1956 and was the LAAP general manager from 1961 until August 1969. Gaines also held the national position of chief of ammunition manufacture for all twenty-six Army munitions plants scattered throughout the United States.\\"Services for Col. Gaines Saturday; Burial with Military Honors Monday\\", Minden Press-Herald, February 3, 1989, p. 1 James E. McMichael (1932-2009) served as the LAAP employment manager for a number of years. He was a former teacher/coach at the defunct Lowe Junior High School in Minden and an administrator in vocational technical education. Applicants selected had to pass a manual dexterity test. From 1975 until 1989, LAAP colloquially known as \\"the shell plant\\", was operated by Morton Thiokol, now Thiokol, which also managed the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas. In 1979, under manager Steve Shows, employment had shrunk to 1,700 people.\\"Army Ammunition Plant under new management - Thiokol Corp.\\", Minden Press-Herald, January 3, 1975, p. 1 Production included 155-mm metal parts and LAP operations on M692,4.2 inch mortar, Ml07 LAP Composition B, M73 Grenade Assembly, and some 2.75 inch warheads.

In 1990, it was one of fourteen active munitions plants in the United States, and had 1,400 employees, half involved in production. The plant pumped $36 million into the local economy. LAAP spent $37 million per year in the purchase of materials to produce mines, grenades, mortar, and artillery rounds.\\"LAAP payroll one of Webster's largest\\", Minden Press-Herald, February 27, 1990, p. 3C In 1993 LAAP began to seek commercial clients to lease partial use of the plant facilities.Bonnie Koskie, \\"LAAP contemplates commercial options\\", Minden Press-Herald September 15, 1993, p. 1 In the mid-1990s, the property came under the management of Lea Hall Properties of Shreveport. In addition to the National Guard installation, the former LAAP is now leased to various commercial entities. Bayou Dorcheat Correctional Center, 2002- present , a $7.3 million state-of-the-art prison opened within LAAP, the Bayou Dorcheat Correctional Center, named for Dorcheat Bayou. Pushed to completion by former Webster Parish Sheriff Larkin T. Riser, the prison was constructed to house up to 340 prisoners. Because the land on which the center sits is former military property, Riser depended on then U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu to break through the federal regulations: \\"She was a real champion for us. She ... helped us get through everything that had to be done in Washington.\\" In addition to the Dorcheat Center, the sheriff's department also has facilities for forty-five inmates on the top floor of the Webster Parish Courthouse in Minden. New facilities opened as Camp Minden, 2013 In December 2013, a $26 million facility to house three military units in more modern facilities opened at Camp Minden. The Armed Forces Reserve Center, visible from U.S. Highway 80, had been under planning and construction since 2008. It provides permanent, consolidated housing for the 1083rd Transportation Company, the 39th Military Police Company, and the 122nd Air Support Operations Squadron. More than three hundred soldiers and airmen were impacted by the new facility. As of 2013 a second project, a Regional Training Institute, was under construction. The U.S. government funded the majority of the construction costs, the state provided $1 million, with another $6 million for infrastructure improvements. Environmental contamination On March 31, 1989, LAAP was listed as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List. The United States Environmental Protection Agency found that the ground water was contaminated by explosive wastes including cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and trinitrotoluene (TNT). On August 24, 2006, an explosion of the Explo Systems, Inc., site leased at Camp Minden, where bombs were disassembled and recycled led to the evacuation of six hundred pupils nearby but caused no injuries or fatalities. The Guardian A large explosion in October 2012 of 15 million pounds of M6 propellant of the Explo Systems, Inc., site rocketed Camp Minden, shattering windows 4 miles away and created a 7,000-foot mushroom cloud contaminating the area. In December 2012, police began to remove 2,700 tons of explosives haphazardly stashed in warehouses and in open air from the Explo Systems site leading to evacuations from nearby Doyline. After materials had been relocated into buildings within Camp Minden, Explo Systems, Inc. filed bankruptcy, and in August 2013 abandoned the materials Camp Minden, Site Background EPA, n.d. accessed 24 July 2017 M6 propellant disposal In July 2014, the EPA ordered the Army to clean up the site on the grounds, that the military should not have entrusted Explo Systems to handle such a large amount of the propellant. Three private firms, General Dynamics Corporation, Alliant Techsystems, and the Ashland, Inc., unit known as \\"Hercules\\" have been participating in the cleanup. In October, 2014 EPA, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Army agreed to dispose of explosive M6 propellant by \\"open burn\\", in \\"prepared trays containing a shallow layer of the material, [as] has been used in other cleanups.\\"Pat Culverhouse M6 propellant to be removed by open burn Minden Press-HeraldNovember 14, 2014, Specht Newspapers, Inc. In May 2015, EPA in conjunction with a Citizens' Advisory Group announced, that a contained burn system in the form of an incinerator would be used. The plan was to dismantle the incinerator and remove it after burns would be finished. To oversee the cleanup, the EPA charged about $8 million on top of $1.2 million which the state of Louisiana had already paid. In June 2015, Explo systems executives asked a state judge to throw out charges, because M6 was not classified as explosive in Louisiana. The Army intended to dispose of the explosives through \\"open burns\\". In June 2015, after months of public controversy, the Louisiana National Guard announced a contract had been awarded to remove millions of pounds of M6 propellant from Camp Minden. A contained burn unit was to be built. The initial $19 million contract could be increased to as much as $35 million to account for additional requirements set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which approved the cleanup.Bonnie Culverhouse, \\"EPA approves disposal of explosives at Minden\\", The Piney Woods Journal, Vol. 19, No. 1 (June 2015), p. 1 The spokesman for the National Guard said that \\"Explosive Service International\\" of Baton Rouge, Louisiana was to oversee the operation. The company received notice from the Louisiana Office of State Procurement to begin work. Eventually a private facility in Colfax, Louisiana 95 miles south, operated by Clean Harbors was chosen.

In July of the same year he won the Outstanding Performance Award for defeating tournament winner Takanohana, which proved to be his only special prize. He reached his highest rank of komusubi the following tournament in September 1994, but scored only six wins against nine losses and never made the rank again. Suffering from diabetes he was demoted from the top division in March 2001 after 39 consecutive tournaments as a maegashira, and after being demoted from the j≈´ry≈ç division in January 2002 he fought in the unsalaried makushita division for the last two years of his career. Retirement from sumo He retired in May 2004, becoming an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Onoe Oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki or official retirement ceremony was held in the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in January 2005. In August 2006 he branched out from Mihogaseki and set up his own Onoe stable, against the wishes of his old stablemaster Mihogaseki Oyakata (who had wanted him to stay and eventually inherit Mihogaseki stable). Onoe took with him six wrestlers he had recruited, including the top division wrestler Baruto and j≈´ry≈ç Satoyama. This marked the first time since Aobaj≈ç left Nishonoseki stable for Oshiogawa stable in 1975 that a makuuchi wrestler had left an established stable for a newly founded one. The Sumo Association subsequently tightened the rules for branching out, requiring elders wishing to set up their own stables to have at least 60 tournaments in the top division or 25 in san'yaku (which would have prevented Onoe from branching out had new rules been in place then). In April 2011 three of his wrestlers (Yamamotoyama, Shirononami and Sakaizawa) were forced to retire by the Japan Sumo Association because of match-fixing. Onoe was demoted two ranks in the Association' elder hierarchy as punishment. In the same month he was found by police to be allegedly driving while intoxicated. Onoe apologised for his actions at a press conference. Fighting style Hamanoshima was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, who preferred grabbing the mawashi to pushing or thrusting. He favoured a hidari-yotsu grip, with his right hand outside and left hand inside his opponent's position. His most common winning kimarite was a straightforward yori-kiri or force out. He was also fond of tsuki-otoshi, or thrust over. He was known for stalling at the tachi-ai to unsettle his opponents.

He was among the earliest followers of Luther convinced to his views at the 1518 Heidelberg Disputation.  Life  Schnepf was born into a prominent Heilbronn Family. He began his studies at the University of Erfurt in 1509 before moving to the University of Heidelberg in 1511, where he took his Master's degree in 1513. He switched from legal to theological studies. Schnepf was one of the young masters who encountered Martin Luther at the famous Heidelberg Disputation.Heinz Scheible (1983) Die Universit√§t Heidelberg und Luthers Disputation, in Zeitschrift f√ºr die Geschichte des Oberrheins 131, pp. 324‚Äì329. Schnepf soon became a committed follower of Luther. He took over the preacher's office in the W√ºrttemberg territory of Weinsberg, as the successor of Johannes Oecolampadius, and preached the evangelical message there.Gerhard Kiesow (1997) Von Rittern und Predigern. Die Herren von Gemmingen und die Reformation im Kraichgau. verlag regionalkultur, Ubstadt-Weiher. pp. 51ff. When the duchy of W√ºrttemberg came under direct Habsburg control, Schnepf was driven from his post and took refuge with the more Protestant-minded Dietrich von Gemmingen. He worked first in Neckarm√ºhlbach (near Castle Guttenberg) in the Kraichgau, and from 1523 in the imperial city of Bad Wimpfen, where he married the mayor's daughter Margaretha Wurzelmann. Upon the request of Count Philip III of Nassau- Weilburg, he introduced the Reformation in 1525/26 at Weilburg. Landgrave Philip I the Magnanimous of Hesse invited him to become theology professor at his newly founded University of Marburg. Schnepf only reluctantly accepted the offer and finally took up the post on 19 August 1528. He was rector of the University in 1532 and 1534 and served as Philip's advisor at the imperial diets of Speyer (1529) and Augsburg (1530). In 1532 he turned down the offer to become the second pastor of Heilbronn after Johann Lachmann. After the restoration of Duke Ulrich, Schnepf returned to W√ºrttemberg at his request to take part in the introduction of the Reformation there in 1534 working in concert with Ambrosius Blarer. Schnepf was named court preacher in Stuttgart and general superintendent of all of the W√ºrttemberg Protestant Church in 1535. He resigned this position in 1544 to become theology professor at the University of T√ºbingen simultaneously maintaining preaching duties. His resistance to the Augsburg Interim led to his dismissal from W√ºrttemberg service by Duke Ulrich in 1548. He received chair of Hebrew at the newly founded University of Jena and also became pastor and superintendent in Jena, where he died in 1558.

At the time of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, he was a Colonel and CO of the 251st Battalion of the Cypriot National Guard, the unit closest to the Turkish landing site. With his unit, he opposed the Turkish army at the Battle of Pentemili beachhead, stalling its advance for two days. He was forced to retreat before numerically far superior Turkish forces and is considered the first missing person of the conflict. Kouroupis was presumed dead during the defence of Kyrenia. According to published reports in the Greek press, the Greek Intelligence Agency attempted a rescue of Kouroupis and other Greek Army officers who were held captive in Turkey. The rescue operation failed and Kouroupis' fate is unknown. He was posthumously awarded the rank of Lieutenant General of the Hellenic Army, the highest military rank of the Hellenic Army. Pavlou Kouroupi Street, in the Aglantzia suburb of Cyprus' capital Nicosia is named after him. Life and education Kouroupis was born in 1929 in Dentra, Messenia to a rural family. He was the third of six siblings. He grew up in Dentra and went to school in Kalamata. Since an early age he wanted to become an officer of the Hellenic Army. In 1952 he graduated from the Evelpidon Military Academy. Following his graduation from the military academy, he studied at and graduated from the Law School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in 1965. Two years later in 1967, he also concluded his studies at the Higher War School of Greece with honours. At around that time he married Maria Karvouni, and, subsequently, they had a daughter, named Evangelia. Military career In 1972, Kouroupis, who was a tagmatarchis at the time, was transferred to Cyprus and became commander of the 251 tagma of the Hellenic Army in Kyrenia, near the Turkish-Cypriot village of Templos. In 1974, he was ordered to defend the city from the Turkish invasion of Cyprus which had just begun. He had only two lochoi at his command and he was defending the city against the numerically far superior 50th battalion of the Turkish army which was landing at the beach with the Battle of Pentemili beachhead just commencing. Kouroupis defended the beachhead with the 1st lochos and a support lochos of heavy armaments. The military forces under Kouroupis command also included officers working at the lochos headquarters, military cooks, and people who had been ordered back to military service. Kouroupis also had a small force of 5 T-34 tanks at his disposal.Georgios Sergis, The battle of Cyprus: July‚ÄìAugust 1974, Second Edition (improved), Athens 1999, Kouroupis' forces were against a superior Turkish battalion force which was supported by aircraft, artillery and naval forces. Despite that, the two companies under Kouroupis' command were able to halt the advance of the Turkish forces and confine them in an area . Kouroupis with a force of about 250‚Äì300 men was able to halt the advance of a Turkish force of 3500 men of the Turkish battalion √áakmak (Tsakmak). On the first day of the invasion, the Turkish forces were unable to advance according to their plans, due to the strong resistance they encountered from the Greek forces under the command of Kouroupis. However, a night raid by the Greek forces against the Turkish forces on the beachhead was unsuccessful due to lack of coordination and artillery support. The battle lasted for approximately two days and with support from the Greek side not materialising, while the Turkish forces were being continuously reinforced, Kouroupis ordered his forces to retreat toward Kerynia to defend the city. Once close to the city, Kouroupis' men were encircled by a Turkish force. He told his men to disperse from a flank that had not yet been blocked by the Turkish army. The men refused to leave but he ordered them to do so. Kouroupis and his second in command remained intending to provide cover for the retreating men. From this point, Kouroupis' whereabouts have remained uncertain. Disappearance and rescue attempt Following the conclusion of the Battle of Pentemili beachhead, the fate of Kouroupis is unknown. On 27 March 1995, Greek reporter Petros Kasimatis wrote in Eleftheros Typos that a Greek intelligence agent in the guise of a fisherman had reported to the Greek intelligence agency that 6 prisoners of war were held at a prison in Bolu, Turkey and another 7 at a prison in Denizli. According to the Kasimatis report, the Greek intelligence officer was able to briefly communicate with the Greek officers at Bolu, after he bribed the Turkish guards. According to Kasimatis, one of the detainees was Kouroupis. All detainees were in very bad condition. The Kasimatis report also mentions that following the intelligence received by the field intelligence officer who had posed as a fisherman, the Greek intelligence service organised a rescue attempt to free Kouroupis and other Greek prisoners at Bolu. During the rescue attempt, fire was exchanged and a Greek intelligence officer was killed. Since that time, the fate of Kouroupis is unknown. To date, the Greek government has not commented on the rescue attempt. Aftermath Kouroupis' wife, Mary Kouroupis, is president of the Panhellenic Committee of Missing and Undeclared Prisoners (). As president of the organisation, she visits Cyprus annually with the relatives of the disappeared to take part in protests against the Turkish invasion and continuing military presence on Cyprus. The protesters are flown to Cyprus with cargo planes provided by the Hellenic Air Force. In 2000, during her visit to Cyprus, Mary Kouroupis expressed her concern that DNA tests and exhumations should not be the only activities related to the disappeared of the conflict, but the discussion should also include those who may still be alive. Posthumous honours and legacy On 12 December 2008, Colonel Kouroupis was posthumously awarded the rank of Lieutenant General of the Hellenic Army, the highest military rank of the Hellenic Army. In an interview to the Ta Nea newspaper in 2009, Kouroupis' wife, Mary Kouroupis, said that apart from the posthumous rank promotion, the Greek state has not provided further recognition to the fallen or disappeared in the conflict of 1974. On 20 July 2014, on the 40th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, representatives of the sister cities of Kalamata and Aglantzia, took part in a ceremony at the metropolitan cathedral of Kalamata recognising the fallen citizens of Kalamata who were killed defending Cyprus during the conflict in 1974. During the eulogy, the municipality of Aglantzia announced the naming of one of its streets in honour of Pavlos Kouroupis. Pavlou Kouroupi Street, in the Aglantzia suburb of Nicosia is named after him. In Kalamata, the bust of Kouroupis has been erected in Panayiotis Foteas square in front of the Messinia Directorate.

He was duke's marshal (1482‚Äì1496), regent of Polatsk (1484‚Äì1496), castellan of Trakai (1492‚Äì1498), voivode of Trakai (1498‚Äì1505), and Grand Marshal of Lithuania (1498‚Äì1508). Zabrzezi≈Ñski was married to Anna, daughter of Jan, elder of Brest and Hrodna. In the period 1476‚Äì1492, he witnessed three legal acts by the Grand Duke and was sent to two diplomatic missions (to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1484 and Kingdom of Poland in 1486). In 1501, as a member of the Lithuanian Council of Lords, he supported the proposed Union of Mielnik. Soon Zabrzezi≈Ñski began a political rivalry with Michael Glinski, a quickly-rising favorite of Alexander Jagiellon. In 1504, under Glinski's influence, Alexander confiscated land possessions of Zabrzezi≈Ñski's son-in-law near Lida. The conflict was soon suppressed by Alexander, who imposed large fines and removed Zabrzezi≈Ñski from all of his positions (Grand Marshal, Voivode, Council of Lords). However, soon Zabrzezi≈Ñski was reinstated as the Grand Marshal and received a generous benefice. During the Battle of Kletsk against the Golden Horde in August 1506, Zabrzezi≈Ñski disagreed with Glinki's command of the Lithuanian army and his men attacked first. They were easily defeated by the Tatars, who mockingly displayed severed heads of the Zabrzezi≈Ñski's men. This disrespect enraged the remainder of the Lithuanian army, which attacked and soundly defeated the Horde. After Alexander's death in August 1506, Zabrzezi≈Ñski accused Glinski of high treason and of poisoning Alexander. As the new King Sigismund I the Old did not clear his name, Glinski ordered Zabrzezi≈Ñski killed in his residence near Hrodna in February 1508. This event is considered the beginning of Glinski's revolt against Sigismund I, which became part of the Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars.Konopczy≈Ñski W., Dzieje Polski nowo≈ºytnej, (Warszawa 1996), p. 9Wojciechowski Z., Zygmunt Stary (1506‚Äì1548), (Warszawa 1979), p. 77.

Their cultures began to overlap in the centuries just before the Christian Era. Jews, as part of the Jewish diaspora, migrated to Rome and Roman Europe from the Land of Israel, Asia Minor, Babylon and Alexandria in response to economic hardship and incessant warfare over the land of Israel between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires. In Rome, Jewish communities enjoyed privileges and thrived economically, becoming a significant part of the Empire's population (perhaps as much as ten percent). The Roman general Pompey in his eastern campaign established Roman Syria in 64 BCE and conquered Jerusalem shortly after, in 63 BCE. Julius Caesar conquered Alexandria 47 BCE and defeated Pompey in 45 BCE. Under Julius Caesar, Judaism was officially recognised as a legal religion, a policy followed by the first Roman emperor, Augustus. The ruling Hasmonean dynasty was deposed by the Romans after the Roman Senate declared Herod the Great \\"King of the Jews\\" in 40 BCE, the Roman province of Egypt was established in 30 BCE, and Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea (biblical Edom) became the Roman province of Iudaea in 6 CE. Jewish‚ÄìRoman tensions resulted in several Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars, 66‚Äì135 CE, which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and institution of the Jewish Tax in 70 and Hadrian's attempt to create a new Roman colony named Aelia Capitolina 130. Around this time, Christianity developed from Second Temple Judaism. In 313, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan giving official recognition to Christianity as a legal religion. Constantine the Great moved the Roman capital from Rome to Constantinople ('New Rome') 330, sometimes considered the start of the Byzantine Empire, and with the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire. The Christian emperors persecuted their Jewish subjects and restricted their rights. Jews in Rome Siege and destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. Painted c.1504 According to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on Rome:Jewish Encyclopedia: Rome: Early Settlement in Rome The Jewish Encyclopedia connects the two civil wars raging during the last decades of the first century BCE: one in Judea between the two Hasmonean brothers Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II and one in the Roman republic between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and describes the evolution of the Jewish population in Rome: Even before Rome annexed Judea as a province, the Romans had interacted with Jews from their diasporas settled in Rome for a century and a half. Many cities of the Roman provinces in the eastern Mediterranean contained very large Jewish communities, dispersed from the time of the sixth century BCE. Rome's involvement in the Eastern Mediterranean dated from 63 BCE, following the end of the Third Mithridatic War, when Rome made Syria a province. After the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus, the proconsul Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) remained to secure the area, including a visit to the Jerusalem Temple. The former king Hyrcanus II was confirmed as ethnarch of the Jews by Julius Caesar in 48 BC.Jos., AJ XIV 190-195. In 37 BC, the Herodian Kingdom was established as a Roman client kingdom and in 6 CE parts became a province of the Roman Empire, named Iudaea Province.Benjamin Isaac The Near East under Roman Rule: Selected Papers (Leiden: Brill 1998). In the Greek cities in the east of the Roman empire, tensions often arose between the Greek and Jewish populations. Writing around 90 CE, the Jewish author Josephus cited decrees by Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Augustus and Claudius, granting Jewish communities with a number of rights.Jos., AJ XIV 185-267; 301-323; XVI 160-178; XIX 278-311. Central privileges included the right to be exempted from polis religious rituals and the permission \\"to follow their ancestral laws, customs and religion\\". Jews were also exempted from military service and the provision of Roman troops.Jos., AJ XIV 228. Contrary to what Josephus wants his readers to believe, the Jews did not have the status of religio licita (permitted religion) as this status did not exist in the Roman empire, nor were all Roman decrees concerning the Jews positive. Instead, the regulations were made as a response to individual requests to the emperor. The decrees were deployed by Josephus \\"as instruments in an ongoing political struggle for status\\".Rajak, Tessa (2007), 'Document and Rhetoric in Josephus: Revisiting the \\"Charter\\" for the Jews', in: Shaye J. D. Cohen and Joshua J. Schwartz (eds.), Studies in Josephus and the Varieties of Ancient Judaism Louis H. Feldman Jubilee Volume (Leiden: Brill), p. 178. . Because of their one-sided viewpoint, the authenticity of the decrees has been questioned many times, but they are now thought to be largely authentic.Rajak, Tessa (2007), 'Document and Rhetoric in Josephus: Revisiting the \\"Charter\\" for the Jews', in: Shaye J. D. Cohen and Joshua J. Schwartz (eds.), Studies in Josephus and the Varieties of Ancient Judaism Louis H. Feldman Jubilee Volume (Leiden: Brill), p. 178. .Except for: Moehring, Horst R. (1975), 'The Acta pro Judaeis in the Antiquities of Flavius Josephus', in: Jacob Neusner (ed.), Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco- Roman Cults 3:124‚Äì58 (Leiden: Brill). Still, Josephus gave only one side of the story by leaving out negative decisions and pretending that the rulings were universal.Rajak, Tessa (1984), \\"Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?\\", The Journal of Roman Studies. 74:p.123. doi:10.2307/299011. This way, he carried out an ideological message showing that the Romans allowed the Jews to carry out their own customs and rituals; the Jews were protected in the past and were still protected by these decisions in his own time. The financial crisis under Caligula (37‚Äì41 CE) has been proposed as the \\"first open break between Rome and the Jews\\", even though problems were already evident during the Census of Quirinius in 6 CE and under Sejanus (before 31 CE).H.H. Ben- Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula, pages 254-256: \\"The reign of Gaius Caligula (37-41 CE) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the Julio- Claudian empire. Until then ‚Äì if one accepts Sejanus' heyday and the trouble caused by the census after Archelaus' banishment ‚Äì there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire East.\\" Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars Relief from the Arch of Titus in Rome depicting a menorah and other objects looted from the Temple of Jerusalem carried in a Roman triumph In 66 CE, the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War began. The revolt was put down by the future Roman emperors Vespasian and Titus. In the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE, the Romans destroyed much of the Temple in Jerusalem and, according to some accounts, plundered artifacts from the Temple, such as the Menorah. Jews continued to live in their land in significant numbers, the Kitos War of 115-117 notwithstanding, until Julius Severus ravaged Judea while putting down the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132‚Äì136. 985 villages were destroyed and most of the Jewish population of central Judaea was essentially wiped out ‚Äì killed, sold into slavery, or forced to flee.Jewish Encyclopedia: BAR KOKBA AND BAR KOKBA WAR: Publius Marcellus: \\"...and thus about fifty strongholds and 985 undefended towns and villages fell into their hands (Dio Cassius, lxix. 14).\\" Banished from Jerusalem, which was renamed Aelia Capitolina, the Jewish population now centered on Galilee,Jewish Encyclopedia: Galilee: \\"After the fall of the Jewish state a new period of prosperity set in for Galilee; and it gradually became the center of Jewish life in Palestine.\\" initially at Yavneh. After the Jewish-Roman wars (66-135), Hadrian changed the name of Iudaea province to Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina in an attempt to erase the historical ties of the Jewish people to the region.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 334: \\"In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.\\" In addition, after 70, Jews and Jewish Proselytes were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the Jewish tax, and after 135 were barred from Jerusalem except for the day of Tisha B'Av. The Diaspora Jewish ritual objects depicted in 2nd century gold glass from Rome Many of the Judaean Jews were sold into slaveryhttp://www.jewishpress.com/sections/books/a-jewish-slave-in- rome/2017/07/24/ while others became citizens of other parts of the Roman Empire. The book of Acts in the New Testament, as well as other Pauline texts, make frequent reference to the large populations of Hellenised Jews in the cities of the Roman world. These Hellenised Jews were only affected by the diaspora in its spiritual sense, absorbing the feeling of loss and homelessness which became a cornerstone of the Jewish faith, much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world. The policy towards proselytization and conversion to Judaism, which spread the Jewish religion throughout Hellenistic civilization, seems to have ended with the wars against the Romans and the following reconstruction of Jewish values for the post-Temple era. Of critical importance to the reshaping of Jewish tradition from the Temple-based religion to the traditions of the Diaspora, was the development of the interpretations of the Torah found in the Mishnah and Talmud. Late Roman period In spite of the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jews remained in the land of Israel in significant numbers. The Jews who remained there went through numerous experiences and armed conflicts against consecutive occupiers of the Land. Some of the most famous and important Jewish texts were composed in Israeli cities at this time. The Jerusalem Talmud, the completion of the Mishnah and the system of niqqud are examples. In this period the tannaim and amoraim were active rabbis who organized and debated the Jewish oral law. A major catalyst in Palestinian Judaism is Judah haNasi, who was a wealthy rabbi and one of the last tannaim, oral interpreters of the Law. He was in good standing with Roman authority figures, which aided in his ascent to being the Patriarch of the Jewish community in Palestine. The decisions of the tannaim are contained in the Mishnah, Beraita, Tosefta, and various Midrash compilations. The Mishnah was completed shortly after 200 CE, probably by Judah haNasi. The commentaries of the amoraim upon the Mishnah are compiled in the Jerusalem Talmud, which was completed around 400 CE, probably in Tiberias. In 351, the Jewish population in Sepphoris, under the leadership of Patricius, started a revolt against the rule of Constantius Gallus, brother-in-law of Emperor Constantius II. The revolt was eventually subdued by Gallus' general, Ursicinus. A pair of putti bearing a menorah, on a cast of a 2nd- or 3rd- century relief (original in the National Museum of Rome) According to tradition, in 359 Hillel II created the Hebrew calendar, which is a lunisolar calendar based on math rather than observation. Until then, the entire Jewish community outside the land of Israel depended on the observational calendar sanctioned by the Sanhedrin; this was necessary for the proper observance of the Jewish holy days. However, danger threatened the participants in that sanction and the messengers who communicated their decisions to distant communities. As the religious persecutions continued, Hillel determined to provide an authorized calendar for all time to come that was not dependent on observation at Jerusalem. Julian, the only emperor to reject Christianity after the conversion of Constantine, allowed the Jews to return to \\"holy Jerusalem which you have for many years longed to see rebuilt\\" and to rebuild the Temple. However Julian was killed in battle on 26 June 363 in his failed campaign against the Sassanid Empire, and the Third Temple was not rebuilt at that time. During the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628 many Jews sided against the Eastern Roman Empire in the Jewish revolt against Heraclius, which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria. In reaction to this further anti-Jewish measures were enacted throughout the Eastern Roman realm and as far away as Merovingian France.Abrahamson et al. The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638. Soon thereafter, 634, the Muslim conquests began, during which many Jews initially rose up again against their Eastern Roman rulers.Rosenwein, Barbara H. (2004). A Short History of the Middle Ages. Ontario. pp. 71‚Äì72. . Dispersion of the Jews in the Roman Empire Expulsion of the Jews in the Reign of the Emperor Hadrian (135 CE): How Heraclius turned the Jews out of Jerusalem. (Facsimile of a miniature in the Histoire des Empereurs, 15th-century manuscript, in the Library of the Arsenal, Paris.) Following the 1st-century Great Revolt and the 2nd-century Bar Kokhba revolt, the destruction of Judea exerted a decisive influence upon the dispersion of the Jewish people throughout the world, as the center of worship shifted from the Temple to Rabbinic authority. Some Jews were sold as slaves or transported as captives after the fall of Judea, others joined the existing diaspora, while still others remained in Judea and began work on the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jews in the diaspora were generally accepted into the Roman Empire, but with the rise of Christianity, restrictions grew. Forced expulsions and persecution resulted in substantial shifts in the international centers of Jewish life to which far-flung communities often looked, although not always unified, due to the Jewish people's dispersion itself. Jewish communities were thereby largely expelled from Judea and sent to various Roman provinces in the Middle East, Europe and North Africa. The Roman Jewry came to develop a character associated with the urban middle class in the modern age.

Apart from General Sun Liren, he was one of the few Nationalist commanders who graduated from a military academy in the West. After the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he served as a field commander in Manchuria until his capture by Marshal Lin Biao's Manchurian Field Army in the Liaoshen Campaign. General Liao was held for 12 years as a prisoner of war until 1961 and died seven years later during the Cultural Revolution. Early life and career Liao Yiaoxiang was born into a rural gentry family in Hunan Province in 1906. He entered a local high school with Yang Kaihui, wife of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong. In 1926, he applied to enter the Whampoa Military Academy and graduated with top remarks. Some of his famous classmates included Chen Cheng, Xue Yue, Fan Hanjie, Dai Li, Hu Zongnan, Qiu Qingquan, Du Yuming, Zhang Lingfu, Hu Lien, Liu Yuzhang, Huang Wei, Li Mi, Wang Yaowu and Lin Biao. In 1930 he was chosen by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as an exchange student to France. In 1936 he graduated from the famed √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr with best grades in the class. He returned home in the same year and with promoted as company commander of the Cavalry unit of the Whampoa Military Academy with the rank of major. Second Sino-Japanese War In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Liao was promoted as chief of staff of the 2nd reserve brigade with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He saw action in the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing. During the bloody street fighting in Nanjing, Liao became stranded in the city along with his classmates Sun Yuanliang, Wang Yaowu and Qiu Qingquan; he escaped the Nanjing Massacre disguised as a Buddhist monk. After the Battle of Wuhan, he was promoted to colonel and commander of officer training corps. He wrote a letter to President Chiang Kai-shek, suggesting making drastic changes in the National Revolutionary Army and build a modern armored unit. Chiang was very pleased with this advice and had a very favorable impression on Liao. In 1938, Chiang promoted Liao as a major general and chief of staff of the 200th Division (National Revolutionary Army). Liao's division commander was Du Yuming. In September 1938, the 200th division was expanded as the 5th corps; the only motorized unit in the Chinese nationalist army. Liao was again placed in charge of command of reserve officer corps and served as assistant division commander of the new 22nd division. Because his superior officer General Qiu Qingquan was away on a mission, he also served as acting division commander. In September 1939, the new 22nd division was sent to Guangxi to fight against Japanese 5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) and scored an important field victory, Japanese commander Major General Masao Nakamura was killed in action along with 8,000 men in the Battle of Kunlun Pass. Afterward his unit was transferred to Yunnan and guarding supplies that came from the Burma Road. After the Japanese navy bombed Pearl Harbor, Japanese conquest of Burma began in January 1942, the Fifteenth Army (Japan) under General Sh≈çjir≈ç Iida invaded British Crown colony of Burma. The British government sent a demand for help to Chongqing, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek organized the Chinese Expeditionary Force (in Burma) under Chief of Staff General Joseph Stillwell, Lieutenant General Du Yuming, deputy commander of the Chinese Expeditionary Force (in Burma) and General Sun Liren, commander of the new 38th division to rescue the British forces and prevent Japanese capture of Burma and their aim to severing the Burma Road. Although the Chinese commanders were able to score some victories in Battle of Yenangyaung and Battle of Toungoo, because the British forces failed to stop the Japanese advance on the battlefield, the Chinese forces were forced to retreat from Burma. When the 18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) cut off their retreat route, the New 22nd Division was forced to go through the Kachin Hills and many veterans died of disease, starvation, as well as animal attacks, before finally made it back to Ledo, Assam. While in India, the New 22nd Division and New 38th Division formed the Chinese Army in India, General Joseph Stillwell made sure these Chinese units received latest American weaponry and training. In 1943, the Chinese forces attacked the Burma Area Army under General Heitar≈ç Kimura. General Liao won some major victories and his unit was expanded into the New 6th Army in 1944. In April 1945 General Liao's New 6th Army flew home for the first time in 3 years and decisively defeated the Japanese forces in the Battle of West Hunan, the deputy leader of the National War Council General He Yingqin decorated him with the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun, the highest honor a Chinese commander can achieve. Chinese Civil War Battle of Heshan When the Chinese Civil War broke out in Manchuria, President Chiang Kai-shek was determined to recover Manchuria for the Nationalist Government. General Liao's New 6th Army and General Sun Liren's New 1st Army spearheaded nationalist advance into the Region. In order to dislodge communist-held cities in Manchuria, Chiang Kai-shek named General Du Yuming as commander-in- chief of Manchuria, Defense Minister General Bai Chongxi as Chief of Staff of the Manchurian Security Command. Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked Marshal Lin Biao in the Campaign to Defend Siping. General Liao Yaoxiang succeeded in capture communist strongholds outside of Siping and forced Communist commanders to abandon the city. The nationalist commanders started to capture most of the cities and towns south of the Songhua River, But President Chiang Kai-shek issued an order to forbid them to cross the river because the Marshall Mission was taken place in China proper. When President Chiang Kai-shek replaced Du Yuming with General Chen Cheng, the situation grew from bad to worse, because the success of the land reform movement in the region and the defection of the Manchukuo Imperial Army to PLA, Communist strength grew over to 1 million men. In 1947, President Chiang Kai-shek appointed General Liao as commander-in-chief of the 9th Army Group, his unit included: The New 1st Army, New 3rd Army, New 6th Army, the 49th Army, 52nd Army, 71st Army, the independent enhanced 207th division and three cavalry brigades. In September 1948, the Communist Manchurian Field Army under Marshal Lin Biao launched the Liaoshen Campaign. General Liao suggested to Nationalist High Command the 9th Army Group must retreat to Yingkou, a nationalist-held seaport and leave Manchuria via sea. But instead, President Chiang Kai-shek ordered him to rescue General Fan Hanjie's besieged forces in Jinzhou. But before General Liao could relieve Jinzhou the city has fallen and Changchun, another nationalist stronghold in Manchuria has changed hands as well. Finally General Du Yuming persuaded Chiang Kai-shek to allow the 9th Army Group to retreat to North China, but they were unable to break through the PLA defensive line around Heishan (ÈªëÂ±±) and Dahushan (Â§ßËôéÂ±±), and lost a considerable amount of time. During a surprise night raid, one communist unit destroyed General Liao's Army Group Headquarters, as a result, his entire command structure was disrupted. Between October 20 to October 28, the PLA forces under General Han Xianchu attacked at Liaoxi (ËæΩË•øÊàòÂΩπ) in the area east of Heshan and Dahushan, and west of Raoyanghe(È•∂Èò≥Ê≤≥). They destroyed twelve Nationalist divisions, including the elite New 1st Army, New 6th Army of 110,000 men, and captured Liao Yaoxiang. Only General Liu Yuzhang's 52nd Army was able to retreat to Shanghai. Release and death After his capture, General Liao was held as a prisoner in Beijing's war criminal camp with his former commander Du Yuming until his pardon in 1961. He was appointed as a commissioner in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in charge of his historical data. He was still very bittered about those high-ranking communist moles in the KMT department of defense, such as director of war-planning board Guo Ruhuai (:zh:ÈÉ≠Ê±ùÁë∞) and Vice Chief of Staff Liu Fei (:zh:ÂäâÊñê), who leaked vital military plans to the communist commanders that result in his defeat. In 1968, General Liao was forced into a struggle session by the Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution, he died of a heart attack at the scene at age 62.

The text of the Ludovicianum is preserved mainly in eleventh- and twelfth-century manuscripts of canon law and has been reconstructed by modern editors. Certain sections of the Ludovicianum are thought to be confirmations of agreements made between Louis's father, Charlemagne, and Pope Hadrian I during the former's trips to Rome in 781 and 787. The negotiations which resulted in the Ludovicianum began during the pontificate of Stephen IV, but the agreement was only concluded shortly after the election of his successor, Paschal I, in January 817. Stephen had anointed and crowned Louis and his wife, Irmingard, at Reims in October 816. In return Louis had granted the Pope everything he had requested, as recorded both in Stephen's biography in the Liber Pontificalis and Louis's biography, the Vita Hludovici imperatoris. Paschal, immediately after his election, sent an embassy to Louis requesting a confirmation of the pactum (agreement) that had been arranged with Stephen.Costambeys, 318‚Äì19. The earliest text purporting to be a complete version of the Pactum made between emperor and pope in 817 is found in late eleventh-century canon law texts, but based on a collection compiled by Cardinal Deusdedit to serve as a preliminary to his Collectio Canonum, finished in 1087.Costambeys, 319. Both Anselm of Lucca and Bonizo of Sutri copied the Ludovicianum into their collections of canon law. The text of the Ludovicianum closely resembles the later Pactum Ottonianum between Emperor Otto the Great and Pope John XII (962). A manuscript fragment that also closely resembles the Ludovicianum and may in fact be a copy of it survives from the ninth or early tenth century, and was first published by Angelo Mercati in 1926. It was written in Caroline minuscule on papyrus, a writing material only regularly in use in the scriptoria of the Papacy at the time.Costambeys, 320. Mercati himself believed it was a copy of the \\"ruler privilege\\" granted by co-emperors Guy and Lambert in 892 to Pope Formosus.

The company primarily operated during the 1980s and 1990s, and is considered among the first national chains to implement the DIY strategy. The company experienced financial difficulties during the late 1980s. Payless Cashways differed from modern home improvement retailers in that they utilized a fully functional outdoor lumber yard. Customers would purchase materials inside the store and upon payment, would drive their vehicle into the lumber yard area and give their order ticket to an attendant. Prior to filing for bankruptcy protection, Payless Cashways operated 194 stores across 22 states.  History  Sanford \\"Sam\\" Furrow founded his business in 1930 with the purchase of a lumberyard in Pocahontas, Iowa that was in default on its loans, along with his sons and business partner John Evans. He then bought two other lumberyards in the same financial position. The original yard was named Kiefer-Wolfe Lumber Company, which was soon renamed Pocahontas Lumber Store. The company grew, and Sam Furrow and John Evans split the company. Sam and his sons began operating on \\"cash-and-carry\\", able to offer lower prices than when taking on the risk of contractors buying on credit. The company eventually adopted the Payless Cashways name, but new locations were added using Furrow's due to trademark issues in Texas, Oregon, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, California, and Indiana. (For example, in Indiana, Payless was a grocery chain). By 1981, the company was the 5th largest in the industry. In 1983, Payless Cashways purchased the Sacramento, California-based Lumberjack Stores Inc for $26.3 million. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In the following year, Payless Cashways purchased the Somerville, Massachusetts-based Somerville Lumber & Supply Company for $12 million in stock. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1986, Payless Cashways purchased the Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Knox Lumber Company for an undisclosed amount. Payless Cashways was taken private in 1988, but didn't see any profits the five years it was private.http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/58/Payless- Cashways-Inc.html Payless Cashways faced their first major challenge in 1988, when they were the target of a leveraged buyout led by Asher Edelman and Sutherland Lumber. The company also received a takeover bid from The Ward White Group, a British company which operated a similarly named retailer in Britain. In response to the takeover attempts, Payless Cashways repurchased the company's 33.6 million outstanding shares at $27 per share, totaling $909 million. The Payless Cashways stock buyback left them saddled with massive debt that stopped their expansion. The retailer's stagnation caused them to be left behind by the big box home centers such as Builders Square, HomeBase, and later the emerging Home Depot and Lowe's chains. The company struggled through the nineties with moderate successes and recurrent failures and never regained the momentum of their first wave of expansion. In July 1997, Payless Cashways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The last straw for Payless Cashways was the burst of the dot com bubble that left many banks unwilling to help the company continue its operations. On September 10, 2001 the company was ordered to be liquidated.  Names Operated Under  Payless Cashways operated stores under a variety of banners, usually with one banner per given area.

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy that existed through the Middle Ages, the period roughly extending from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century to the Renaissance in the 15th century. Medieval philosophy, understood as a project of independent philosophical inquiry, began in Baghdad, in the middle of the 8th century, and in France, in the itinerant court of Charlemagne, in the last quarter of the 8th century. It is defined partly by the process of rediscovering the ancient culture developed in Greece and Rome during the Classical period, and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate sacred doctrine with secular learning. The history of medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the Latin West following the Early Middle Ages until the 12th century, when the works of Aristotle and Plato were rediscovered, translated, and studied upon, and the \\"golden age\\" of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, along with the reception of its Arabic commentators, and significant developments in the fields of philosophy of religion, logic, and metaphysics. The Medieval Era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric \\"middle period\\" between the Classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the rebirth or renaissance of Classical culture. Modern historians consider the medieval era to be one of philosophical development, heavily influenced by Christian theology. One of the most notable thinkers of the era, Thomas of Aquinas, never considered himself a philosopher, and criticized philosophers for always \\"falling short of the true and proper wisdom\\". The problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of faith to reason, the existence and simplicity of God, the purpose of theology and metaphysics, and the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.  Characteristics  Avicenna Medieval philosophy places heavy emphasis on the theological.Medieval Philosophy: Essential Readings with Commentary, edited by Gyula Klima, Fritz Allhoff, Anand Jayprakash Vaidya, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p. 3. With the possible exceptions of Avicenna and Averroes, medieval thinkers did not consider themselves philosophers at all: for them, the philosophers were the ancient pagan writers such as Plato and Aristotle. However, their theology used the methods and logical techniques of the ancient philosophers to address difficult theological questions and points of doctrine. Thomas Aquinas, following Peter Damian, argued that philosophy is the handmaiden of theology (ancilla theologiae). Despite this view of philosophy as the servant of theology, this did not prevent the medievals from developing original and innovative philosophies against the backdrop of their theological projects. For instance, such thinkers as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas of Aquinas made monumental breakthroughs in the philosophy of temporality and metaphysics, respectively. The principles that underlie all the medieval philsophers' work are: * The use of logic, dialectic, and analysis to discover the truth, known as ratio; * Respect for the insights of ancient philosophers, in particular Aristotle, and deference to their authority (auctoritas); * The obligation to co-ordinate the insights of philosophy with theological teaching and revelation (concordia). One of the most heavily debated things of the period was that of faith versus reason. Avicenna and Averroes both leaned more on the side of reason. Augustine stated that he would never allow his philosophical investigations to go beyond the authority of God. Anselm attempted to defend against what he saw as partly an assault on faith, with an approach allowing for both faith and reason. The Augustinian solution to the faith/reason problem is to (1) believe, and then (2) seek to understand (fides quaerens intellectum).  History = Early medieval Christian philosophy  Portrait by Philippe de Champaigne, 17th century The boundaries of the early medieval period are a matter of controversy. It is generally agreed that it begins with Augustine (354‚Äì430) who strictly belongs to the classical period, and ends with the lasting revival of learning in the late eleventh century, at the beginning of the high medieval period. After the collapse of the Roman empire, Western Europe lapsed into the so-called Dark Ages. Monasteries were among the limited number of focal points of formal academic learning, which might be presumed to be a result of a rule of St Benedict's in 525, which required monks to read the Bible daily, and his suggestion that at the beginning of Lent, a book be given to each monk. In later periods, monks were used for training administrators and churchmen. Early Christian thought, in particular in the patristic period, tends to be intuitional and mystical, and is less reliant on reason and logical argument. It also places more emphasis on the sometimes-mystical doctrines of Plato, and less upon the systematic thinking of Aristotle. Much of the work of Aristotle was unknown in the West in this period. Scholars relied on translations by Boethius into Latin of Aristotle's Categories, the logical work On Interpretation, and his Latin translation of Porphyry's Isagoge, a commentary on Aristotle's Categories. Two Roman philosophers had a great influence on the development of medieval philosophy: Augustine and Boethius. Augustine is regarded as the greatest of the Church Fathers. He is primarily a theologian and a devotional writer, but much of his writing is philosophical. His themes are truth, God, the human soul, the meaning of history, the state, sin, and salvation. For over a thousand years, there was hardly a Latin work of theology or philosophy that did not quote his writing, or invoke his authority. Some of his writing had an influence on the development of early modern philosophy, such as that of Descartes. Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (480 c.‚Äì524) was a Christian philosopher born in Rome to an ancient and influential family. He became consul in 510 in the kingdom of the Ostrogoths. His influence on the early medieval period was also marked (so much so that it is sometimes called the Boethian period).Catarina Dutilh Novaes & Stephen Read, The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Logic, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016, Introduction He intended to translate all the works of Aristotle and Plato from the original Greek into Latin, and translated many of Aristotle's logical works, such as On Interpretation, and the Categories. He wrote commentaries on these works, and on the Isagoge by Porphyry (a commentary on the Categories). This introduced the problem of universals to the medieval world. The first significant renewal of learning in the West came when Charlemagne, advised by Candidus, Peter of Pisa and Alcuin of York, attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by imperial decree in 787 AD established schools in every abbey in his empire. These schools, from which the name Scholasticism is derived, became centres of medieval learning.Abbo of FleuryJohannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815 ‚Äì 877), successor of Alcuin of York as head of the Palace School, was an Irish theologian and Neoplatonic philosopher. He is notable for having translated and made commentaries upon the work of Pseudo-Dionysius, initially thought to be from the apostolic age. Around this period several doctrinal controversies emerged, such as the question of whether God had predestined some for salvation and some for damnation. Eriugena was called in to settle this dispute. At the same time, Paschasius Radbertus raised an important question about the real presence of Christ at the Eucharist. Is the host the same as Christ's historical body? How can it be present at many places and many times? Radbertus argued that Christ's real body is present, veiled by the appearance of bread and wine, and is present at all places and all times, by means of God's incomprehensible power. This period also witnessed a revival of scholarship. At Fleury, Theodulphus, bishop of Orl√©ans, established a school for young noblemen recommended there by Charlemagne. By the mid-ninth century, its library was one of the most comprehensive ever assembled in the West, and scholars such as Lupus of Ferri√®res (d. 862) traveled there to consult its texts. Later, under St. Abbo of Fleury (abbot 988‚Äì1004), head of the reformed abbey school, Fleury enjoyed a second golden age. Remigius of Auxerre, at the beginning of the tenth century, produced glosses or commentaries on the classical texts of Donatus, Priscian, Boethius, and Martianus Capella. The Carolingian period was followed by a small dark age that was followed by a lasting revival of learning in the eleventh century, which owed much to the rediscovery of Greek thought from Arabic translations and Muslim contributions such as Avicenna's On the soul.  High Middle Ages  The period from the middle of the eleventh century to the middle of the fourteenth century is known as the 'High medieval' or 'scholastic' period. It is generally agreed to begin with Saint Anselm of Canterbury (1033‚Äì1109) an Italian philosopher, theologian, and church official who is famous as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Plato, Seneca, and Aristotle from Devotional and Philosophical Writings, c. 1330 The 13th and early 14th centuries are generally regarded as the high period of scholasticism. The early 13th century witnessed the culmination of the recovery of Greek philosophy. Schools of translation grew up in Italy and Sicily, and eventually in the rest of Europe. Scholars such as Adelard of Bath travelled to Sicily and the Arab world, translating works on astronomy and mathematics, including the first complete translation of Euclid‚Äôs Elements.Marshall Clagett, \\"Medieval Latin Translations from the Arabic of the Elements of Euclid, with Special Emphasis on the Versions of Adelard of Bath,\\" Isis 44: 16‚Äì42 (1982). Powerful Norman kings gathered men of knowledge from Italy and other areas into their courts as a sign of their prestige.David C. Lindberg (ed.), Science in the Middle Ages, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978, p. 70-72. William of Moerbeke's translations and editions of Greek philosophical texts in the middle half of the thirteenth century helped in forming a clearer picture of Greek philosophy, and in particular of Aristotle, than was given by the Arabic versions they had previously relied on, which had distorted or obscured the relation between Platonic and Aristotelian systems of philosophy. His work formed the basis of the major commentaries that followed. The universities developed in the large cities of Europe during this period, and rival clerical orders within the Church began to battle for political and intellectual control over these centers of educational life. The two main orders founded in this period were the Franciscans and the Dominicans. The Franciscans were founded by Francis of Assisi in 1209. Their leader in the middle of the century was Bonaventure, a traditionalist who defended the theology of Augustine and the philosophy of Plato, incorporating only a little of Aristotle in with the more neoplatonist elements. Following Anselm, Bonaventure supposed that reason can discover truth only when philosophy is illuminated by religious faith. Other important Franciscan writers were Duns Scotus, Peter Auriol, and William of Ockham.Thomas AquinasBy contrast, the Dominican order, founded by St Dominic in 1215 placed more emphasis on the use of reason and made extensive use of the new Aristotelian sources derived from the East, and Moorish Spain. The great representatives of Dominican thinking in this period were Albertus Magnus and (especially) Thomas Aquinas, whose artful synthesis of Greek rationalism and Christian doctrine eventually came to define Catholic philosophy. Aquinas placed more emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. This was a significant departure from the Neoplatonic and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism. Aquinas showed how it was possible to incorporate much of the philosophy of Aristotle without falling into the \\"errors\\" of the Commentator Averroes. At the start of the 20th century, historian and philosopher Martin Grabmann was the first scholar to work out the outlines of the ongoing development of thought in scholasticism and to see in Thomas Aquinas a response and development of thought rather than a single, coherently emerged and organic whole. Although Grabmann's works in German are numerous, only Thomas Aquinas (1928) is available in English. However, Grabmann's thought was instrumental in the whole modern understanding of scholasticism and the pivotal role of Aquinas.  Topics  All the main branches of philosophy today were a part of Medieval philosophy. Medieval philosophy also included most of the areas originally established by the pagan philosophers of antiquity, in particular Aristotle. However, the discipline now called Philosophy of religion was, it is presumed, a unique development of the Medieval era, and many of the problems that define the subject first took shape in the Middle Ages, in forms that are still recognisable today.  Theology  Medieval philosophy is characteristically theological. Subjects discussed in this period include: * The problem of the compatibility of the divine attributes: How are the attributes traditionally ascribed to the Supreme Being, such as unlimited power, knowledge of all things, infinite goodness, existence outside time, immateriality, and so on, logically consistent with one another? * The problem of evil: The classical philosophers had speculated on the nature of evil, but the problem of how an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God could create a system of things in which evil exists first arose in the medieval period. * The problem of free will: A similar problem was to explain how 'divine foreknowledge' ‚Äì God's knowledge of what will happen in the future ‚Äì is compatible with our belief in our own free will. *Questions regarding the immortality of the intellect, the unity or non-unity between the soul and the intellect, and the consequent intellectual basis for believing in the immortality of the soul. *The question of whether there can be substances which are non-material, for example, angels.  Metaphysics  Book 7 of the Metaphysics: Ens dicitur multipliciter ‚Äì the word 'being' is predicated in many ways After the 'rediscovery' of Aristotle's Metaphysics in the mid- twelfth century, many scholastics wrote commentaries on this work (in particular Aquinas and Scotus). The problem of universals was one of the main problems engaged during that period. Other subjects included: * Hylomorphism ‚Äì development of the Aristotelian doctrine that individual things are a compound of material and form (the statue is a compound of granite, and the form sculpted into it) * Existence ‚Äì being qua being * Causality ‚Äì Discussion of causality consisted mostly of commentaries on Aristotle, mainly the Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption. The approach to this subject area was uniquely medieval, the rational investigation of the universe being viewed as a way of approaching God. Duns Scotus' proof of the existence of God is based on the notion of causality. * Individuation. The problem of individuation is to explain how we individuate or numerically distinguish the members of any kind for which it is given. The problem arose when it was required to explain how individual angels of the same species differ from one another. Angels are immaterial, and their numerical difference cannot be explained by the different matter they are made of. The main contributors to this discussion were Aquinas and Scotus.  Natural philosophy  In natural philosophy and the philosophy of science, medieval philosophers were mainly influenced by Aristotle. However, from the fourteenth century onward, the increasing use of mathematical reasoning in natural philosophy prepared the way for the rise of science in the early modern period. The more mathematical reasoning techniques of William Heytesbury and William of Ockham are indicative of this trend. Other contributors to natural philosophy are Albert of Saxony, John Buridan, and Nicholas of Autrecourt. See also the article on the Continuity thesis, the hypothesis that there was no radical discontinuity between the intellectual development of the Middle Ages and the developments in the Renaissance and early modern period.  Logic  The great historian of logic I. M. BochenskiI. M. Bochenski, A History of Formal Logic, Notre dame University Press, 1961, pp. 10‚Äì18 regarded the Middle Ages as one of the three great periods in the history of logic. From the time of Abelard until the middle of the fourteenth century, scholastic writers refined and developed Aristotelian logic to a remarkable degree. In the earlier period, writers such as Peter Abelard wrote commentaries on the works of the Old logic (Aristotle's Categories, On interpretation, and the Isagoge of Porphyry). Later, new departments of logical enquiry arose, and new logical and semantic notions were developed. For logical developments in the Middle Ages, see the articles on insolubilia, obligations, properties of terms, syllogism, and sophismata. Other great contributors to medieval logic include Albert of Saxony, John Buridan, John Wyclif, Paul of Venice, Peter of Spain, Richard Kilvington, Walter Burley, William Heytesbury, and William of Ockham.  Philosophy of mind  Medieval philosophy of mind is based on Aristotle's De Anima, another work discovered in the Latin West in the twelfth century. It was regarded as a branch of the philosophy of nature. Some of the topics discussed in this area include: * Divine illumination ‚Äì The doctrine of Divine illumination was an alternative to naturalism. It holds that humans need a special assistance from God in their ordinary thinking. The doctrine is most closely associated with Augustine and his scholastic followers. It reappeared in a different form in the early modern era. * theories of demonstration * mental representation ‚Äì The idea that mental states have 'intentionality'; i.e., despite being a state of the mind, they are able to represent things outside the mind is intrinsic to the modern philosophy of mind. It has its origins in medieval philosophy. (The word 'intentionality' was revived by Franz Brentano, who was intending to reflect medieval usagePsychology from an Empirical Standpoint, transl. by A.C. Rancurello, D.B. Terrell, and L. McAlister, London: Routledge, 1973. (2nd ed., intr. by Peter Simons, 1995), p. 88.). Ockham is well known for his theory that language signifies mental states primarily by convention, real things secondarily, whereas the corresponding mental states signify real things of themselves and necessarily.That is, our idea of a rabbit necessarily represents a rabbit. A mental state 'is a true similitude of the external thing, on account of which it represents (repraesentat) the external thing itself, and stands for it from its nature, just as an utterance denotes things by institution'. Writers in this area include Saint Augustine, Duns Scotus, Nicholas of Autrecourt, Thomas Aquinas, and William of Ockham.  Ethics  Writers in this area include Anselm, Augustine, Peter Abelard, Scotus, Peter of Spain, Aquinas, and Ockham. Writers on political theory include Dante, John Wyclif, and William of Ockham.

He was formerly at the ACRIM Lab group and an adjunct assistant professor in the physics department at Duke University. His research interests are in theoretical and applied statistics and nonlinear models of complex processes. He has published peer-reviewed papers in journals covering a scatter of disciplines, including astronomy, biology, climatology, economics, medicine, physics and sociology. Early life and education Scafetta was born in Italy. He received a Laurea in physics from the University of Pisa in 1997 and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of North Texas in 2001. His doctoral thesis was titled An entropic approach to the analysis of time series. Career Scafetta was a research associate in the electrical and computer engineering department at Duke University from 2002 to 2003 and then a research scientist in the physics department from 2003 to 2009. He has been a visiting lecturer at Elon University and the University of North Carolina. Scafetta was a research associate at the ACRIM Lab group and an adjunct assistant professor in the physics department at Duke University for a few years after 2010. He is currently affiliated with the University of Napoli Federico II in Naples, Italy. He is a member of the American Physical Society, American Geophysical Union and the American Association of Physics Teachers. ACRIM Scafetta argues that the total solar irradiance (TSI) measurements gathered by satellites since 1978 are flawed because the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster prevented the timely launching of the ACRIM 2 satellite, which he worked on, to replace ACRIM 1. This results in a two-year data gap in the ACRIM time series, which scientists bridge with overlapping data from several other satellites. They conclude that heating from the Sun did not increase between 1980 and 2002 and does not significantly contribute to the global surface warming over that period. Some ACRIM investigators, including principal investigator Richard Willson (Columbia) and Scafetta, disagree and argue for a significant upward trend in average solar luminosity during the same period. The Duke University student newspapers report that Scafetta and West's interpretation of Richard Willson's analysis is that \\"the sun may have minimally contributed about 10 to 30 percent of the 1980-2002 global surface warming.\\" Scientific contributions Scafetta developed \\"Diffusion Entropy Analysis\\", a method of statistical analysis which distinguishes between Levy Walk noises and Fractional Brownian motion in complex systems. Scafetta used this method in a 2002 analysis of teen pregnancy. Views on climate change Scafetta has argued, \\"At least 60% of the warming of the Earth observed since 1970 appears to be induced by natural cycles which are present in the solar system.\\" According to Scafetta, the only reasonable explanation is that the climate system is modulated by astronomical oscillations. Natural cycles known with certainty are the 11 (Schwabe) and 22 (Hale) year solar cycles, the cycles of the planets and luni-solar nodal cycles. Jupiter has an orbital period of 11.9 years while Saturn has an orbital period of 29.4 years. These periods predict three other major cycles which are associated with Jupiter and Saturn: about 10 years, the opposition of two planets; about 20 years, their synodic cycle; and about 60 years, the repetition of the combined orbits of the two planets. The major lunar cycles are about 18.6 and 8.85 years. Scafetta's climate model is based primarily on a numerological comparison of secular periodic changes of global surface temperature and the Sun¬¥s periodic movement around barycenter of the Solar System caused by the revolving planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Periodic modulation of Moon¬¥s orbital parameters by these planets and subsequent modulation of lunar tides is also discussed. According to Scafetta, who provides no physical explanation of that process, \\"external forcing of celestial origin simply drives the adjustment of the natural rhythms by letting their own energy flow with the same frequency of the forcing. It just passes to the climatic system the information of how it has to oscillate, not the entire energy to make it oscillate. The effect of a periodic external forcing, even if weak, may become macroscopic and all components of the system gradually synchronize with it\\".Nicola Scafetta, \\"Empirical evidence for a celestial origin of the climate oscillations and its implications,\\" Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 2010 72, 951-970.

Scafetta responded by saying that the code in question had been submitted to a scientific journal and that if \\"the journal takes its time to publish it, it is not our fault.\\" In a 2011 article published in The Open Atmospheric Science Journal ecologist Craig Loehle of the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement (a forest industry institution) and Scafetta forecast that the world climate \\"may remain approximately steady until 2030-2040, and may at most warm 0.5-1.0¬∞C by 2100 at the estimated 0.66¬∞C/century anthropogenic warming rate\\".Craig Loehle and Nicola Scafetta, \\"Climate Change Attribution Using Empirical Decomposition of Climatic Data,\\" The Open Atmospheric Science Journal, 2011 5, 74-86.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers. Amateur career Beachy attended Northwestern Senior High School in Kokomo, Indiana. He helped lead their baseball team to Indiana's 2004‚Äì2005 class AA state championship game. After the game, he was presented with the Indiana High School Athletic Association Mental Attitude Award. After high school, he attended Indiana Wesleyan University, where he played third base, first base, and pitched for the Indiana Wesleyan Wildcats. Beachy was not selected in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft following his junior year of college, but signed with the Atlanta Braves as an undrafted free agent on July 22, 2008. Career=Minor leagues Beachy signing autographs in 2012 Beachy compiled a 4‚Äì3 record with one save and a 3.87 ERA in 76 innings of work spread over 35 appearances and three different teams in 2009. He struck out 64 batters and walked 19. Most of his time was spent with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Class A advanced Carolina League. In spring 2010, Beachy was one of six pitchers who took part in a spring mini-camp in which some of the Braves‚Äô top minor leaguers took turns serving as backups for major league players in spring training games. He was the youngest minor leaguer in the mini-camp. Beachy was moved into the starting rotation for the AA Mississippi Braves late June 2010. In his time as a AA player, he struck out 100 batters while allowing 53 hits and 22 walks in 27 games (73.2 innings) while maintaining a 1.47 ERA. He compiled a record of 3 wins and 1 loss. Opposing hitters hit .200 and produced 12 earned runs. Beachy's best performance of the season occurred on July 15 when he struck out 13 of 19 batters against the Huntsville Stars. Beachy was promoted to the AAA Gwinnett Braves in the fall of 2010. While there, he delivered 2 wins with 0 losses and a 2.17 ERA. =Major LeaguesAtlanta Braves Beachy made his major league debut with the Braves as the starting pitcher against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 20, 2010, as a replacement for Jair Jurrjens who had injured his knee. Beachy pitched for 4 innings, gave up three runs (one earned), and received his first major league loss. He had two losses in three starts for the Braves in 2010, with an ERA of 3.00. On March 24, 2011, the Braves announced that Beachy would be the club's fifth starter for the 2011 season. He was selected over Mike Minor for the final spot in Atlanta's rotation. In his fourth start of the season, he recorded his first major-league win by throwing six scoreless innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Dodger Stadium on April 19. During his first game back from an oblique injury, he set a new career high with 11 strikeouts in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 22, 2011. He was 7‚Äì3 with a 3.68 ERA in 25 starts that season for the Braves. Beachy got off to a strong start in 2012, and on May 17, 2012, he threw his first career shutout in a game against the Miami Marlins.ERA leader Beachy throws first shutout in rout of Fish He was placed on the disabled list on June 17 after suffering from elbow discomfort and on June 18, he was diagnosed with a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. At the time, he led all starting pitchers in the major leagues with a 2.00 ERA. Beachy underwent Tommy John surgery on June 21, ending his 2012 season. Beachy began the 2013 season on the 15-day disabled list, still recovering from the surgery and he returned to the Braves' starting rotation and made his season debut on July 29, 2013 in the place of Tim Hudson, who suffered a season-ending ankle fracture. He was 2‚Äì1 with a 4.50 ERA in five starts at the end of the season. However, Beachy was not on the Braves' postseason roster. On December 16, 2013, Beachy agreed with the Braves on a one-year deal for the 2014 season. However, on March 20, it was reported that he would need a second Tommy John surgery and he did not pitch during the 2014 season. Beachy became a free agent on December 2, 2014 after he was non-tendered by the Braves. Los Angeles Dodgers On February 21, 2015, Beachy agreed to a 1-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with a club option for 2016. He returned to the mound in a professional game for the first time since the surgery on June 16, 2015, when he threw 35 pitches for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in a California League game. He then pitched in several AAA games for the Oklahoma City Dodgers before he was called up to the majors on July 11. In his first start in two years, Beachy lasted four innings and gave up three runs on five hits. He made a second start on July 20, allowing four runs in five innings, and was then optioned back to AAA. He was designated for assignment on July 30. He made 10 starts in AAA (and one relief appearance) and was 1‚Äì1 with a 3.64 ERA. On January 6, 2016, the Dodgers re- signed Beachy to a one-year, $1.5 million, major league contract. However, on January 27 he was outrighted to the minors. Beachy was invited to major league spring training and emerged as an early favorite to win the fifth starter job to start the season. However, he struggled with his command in spring training action and was sidelined with elbow tendinitis that put him on the minor league disabled list to start the season. After initially thinking it was a minor issue, the tendinitis recurred when he tried to pitch again.http://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/dodgers-brandon-beachy- ceased-throwing-activities/ and he left the Dodgers spring training complex to return home.http://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/dodgers-brandon- beachy-leaves-teams-spring-training-complex/ New Britain Bees On August 14, 2018, after several years out of baseball, Beachy signed with the New Britain Bees of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the 2018 season. San Francisco Giants On February 2, 2019, Beachy signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. He was released on July 26, 2019. Long Island Ducks On August 5, 2019, Beachy signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. On April 6, 2020, Beachy re-signed with the Ducks for the upcoming season. Pitching style Beachy throws four pitches: a relatively straight four-seam fastball in the 90-94 mph range, a slider (80-84), a changeup (78-82), and a curveball (71-75). Beachy throws mostly fastballs and sliders to right-handed hitters, but he uses his changeup more frequently against left-handed hitters. He is especially fond of using his slider in two-strike counts. Personal life Beachy's parents are Lester and Lori Beachy; he is the eldest of seven siblings. He majored in pre-law and criminal justice and has worked at a center for delinquent children.

It occurred on the night of July 7/8, 1950 in the village of Chonan in western South Korea. The fight ended in a North Korean victory after intense fighting around the town, which took place throughout the night and into the morning. The United States Army's 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division was assigned to delay elements of the North Korean People's Army's 4th Infantry Division as it advanced south following its victories at the Battle of Osan and the Battle of Pyongtaek the days before. The regiment emplaced north and south of Chonan attempting to delay the North Koreans in an area where the terrain formed a bottleneck between mountains and the Yellow Sea. The 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry set up a defensive perimeter north of the city, and by nightfall was engaged in combat with superior numbers of North Korean troops and tanks. American forces, unable to repulse North Korean armor, soon found themselves in an intense urban fight as columns of North Korean troops, spearheaded by T-34 tanks, entered the town from two directions, cutting off U.S. forces. The fight resulted in the near destruction of the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry as well as the death of the 34th Infantry Regiment's new commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin. Background= Outbreak of war  On the night of June 25, 1950, 10 divisions of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000 men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army completely by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans, who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war.Alexander 2003, p. 1. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000 South Korean soldiers on the front, advancing steadily south.Alexander 2003, p. 2. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion, and by June 28, the North Koreans had captured Seoul, South Korea's capital, forcing the government and its shattered forces to withdraw south.Varhola 2000, p. 2. Task Force Smith arrives in South Korea. The United Nations Security Council voted to send assistance to the collapsing country. United States President Harry S. Truman subsequently ordered ground troops into the nation.Varhola 2000, p. 3. However, U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II five years earlier. At the time, the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was performing occupation duty in Kyushu, Japan under the command of William F. Dean. However, the division was under strength, and was only two-thirds the size of its regular wartime size. Most of the 24th Infantry Division's equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending following World War II. In spite of these deficiencies, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea, with a mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of North Korean advances while the rest of the Eighth Army could arrive in Korea and establish a perimeter.Catchpole 2001, p. 14.  Early engagements  From the 24th Infantry Division, one battalion was assigned to be airlifted into Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and move quickly to block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division was transported to South Korea on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was determined to be the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying over 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back.Varhola 2000, p. 4. During that time, the 34th Infantry Regiment set up a line between the villages of Pyongtaek and Ansong, south of Osan, to fight the next delaying action against the advancing North Korean forces.Alexander 2003, p. 62. 34th Infantry Regiment was similarly unprepared for a fight; in the ensuing action, most of the regiment withdrew to Chonan without ever engaging the enemy.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 74. The 1st Battalion, left alone against the North Koreans, resisted their advance in the brief and disastrous Battle of Pyongtaek. The 34th Infantry was unable to stop North Korean armor, because equipment had not arrived that could penetrate the thick armor of the T-34 tank.Catchpole 2001, p. 15. After a 30-minute fight, the battalion mounted a disorganized retreat, with many soldiers abandoning equipment and running away without resisting the North Korean forces. The U.S. forces at Pyongtaek and Ansong were unable to delay the North Korean force significantly or inflict significant casualties on the enemy.Gugeler 2005, p. 16.Alexander 2003, p. 66.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 78.  Battle = Opening moves  alt=A Caucasian man with gray hair in a military uniform. Having pushed back U.S. forces at both Osan and Pyongtaek, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division, continued their advance down the Osan‚ÄìChonan road, up to 12,000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported by dozens of tanks. They were well trained, well equipped, and had high morale following previous victories, giving them advantages over the poorly trained and inexperienced Americans.Alexander 2003, p. 63.Gugeler 2005, p. 12. Following the retreat from Pyongtaek, the scattered 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry retreated to Chonan, where the rest of the 34th Infantry Regiment was located. Also at the town were elements of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry that had not made up Task Force Smith at the Battle of Osan.Appleman 1998, p. 81. Brigadier General George B. Barth, 24th Infantry Division's artillery commander, ordered the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry to hold positions south of town before Barth left for Taejon. The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was sent to join it. At the same time, L Company of the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry was ordered to probe north of the city and meet the advancing elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division.Appleman 1998, p. 82. Major General Dean, commander of the 24th Infantry Division, telegraphed the command from Taejon, ordering the rest of 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry to move up behind L Company.Appleman, p. 83. Regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless moved north to join L Company, along with newly arrived Colonel Robert R. Martin, a friend of Dean's. Shortly before noon, 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry was ordered to withdraw southeast to Chochiwon to keep the railway and supply line to Chonan open. This left 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 34th Infantry alone in Chonan.Appleman 1998, p. 89. By this time, most of the South Korean troops and civilians had abandoned the region, leaving only the U.S. forces to oppose the North Korean Army. At around 1300, L Company of 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry was north of Chonan when it was hit with North Korean small arms fire. Around this time, Martin received a message from Dean that around 50 North Korean T-34 tanks were at Ansong, along with a significant number of North Korean trucks. Large numbers of troops were now located in the villages of Myang, Myon and Songhwan-ni, and moving to flank Chonan from both sides.Appleman 1998, p. 84. Martin and Lovless returned to the 34th Infantry's command post, as the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began setting up defensive positions several miles north of Chonan under the command of 34th Infantry Operations Officer John J. Dunn. The battalion briefly retreated when around 50 North Korean scouts began assaulting its positions, leaving behind several wounded men and equipment, including a wounded Dunn who was captured by the North Koreans.Appleman 1998, p. 85.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 79. It was two hours before the main North Korean force advanced through this position.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 80. The battalion returned to Chonan in disorder. By 1700, it re-established defensive positions on the northern and western edges of the town, around a railroad station.Appleman, p. 86.Alexander 2003, p. 67. The 1st Battalion, still disorganized and under-equipped after its engagement at Pyongtaek the day before, remained in defensive positions south of the town. It would not see combat in Chonan.Gugeler 2005, p. 18. Around 1800, Dean ordered Martin to take command of the 34th Infantry Regiment from Lovless.  North Korean attack  Throughout the evening of July 7, North Korean pressure developed from the west edge of town. Around 2000 a column of North Korean tanks and infantry approached the town from the east. The column was hit by shells from the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, which was supporting the 34th Infantry with 105 mm Howitzers firing white phosphorus and High Explosive Anti Tank shells. The 63rd Field Artillery Battalion was able to destroy two of the tanks, but by midnight the column had infiltrated Chonan. The 63rd Field Artillery continued to fire white phosphorus throughout the night, illuminating the terrain for the U.S. forces and preventing them from being overrun. After midnight, the North Korean force was able to cut off 80 men, including Martin, from the rest of the U.S. force, and Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Wadlington, the regimental executive officer, took command and contacted Dean requesting additional ammunition. By 0220 on July 8 Martin had returned to the town and the supply road to Taejon was reopened. Within a few hours, a second column of infantry assaulted the town from the northwest. Five or six tanks at the head of the column infiltrated Chonan and began destroying all vehicles in sight, as well as any buildings suspected of harboring Americans. Around 0600, infantry from the northwest column began flooding into the city and engaged in an intense and confused battle with the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment in the streets of Chonan.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 81. 3rd Battalion managed to destroy two of the tanks with rockets and grenades, but the column was able to cut off two companies of the 3rd Battalion from the rest of the force. Around 0800, Martin was killed by a North Korean tank when he fired a 2.36-inch bazooka at a North Korean T-34 tank at the same time it fired its main cannon at the building he was in. He had been in command of the 34th Infantry Regiment for only 14 hours. The tank was undamaged by Martin's shot, as the weapon was obsolete and could not penetrate T-34 armor.  American withdrawal  After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to buckle as increasing numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now in command of the 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged.Appleman 1998, p. 88. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.Gugeler 2005, p. 19. As this was happening, General Dean arrived south of the town with Lieutenant General Walton Walker to observe the conflict, and the final elements of the 34th leave Chonan. Dean ordered the 34th Infantry Regiment to retreat to the Kum River. 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry, now down to 175 men, had lost two thirds of its strength in Chonan, around 350 men. Most of the battalion's heavy equipment including mortars and machine guns were also lost. The North Korean radio reported 60 Americans were taken prisoner in the town. The regiment began its retreat in the late afternoon, with North Korean forces moving on ridges parallel to the regiment. Most of the battalion moved out on foot and by truck, resting on the evening of July 8 before arriving at the Kum River July 9 and setting up new defensive positions. Aftermath The 34th Infantry pulled back to the Kum River, its two battalions having been mauled in the battles of Pyongtaek and Chonan. It was able to delay North Korean forces for 14‚Äì20 hours, allowing the 21st Infantry Regiment to set up the next delaying action at Chonui and Chochiwon.Gugeler 2005, p. 20. The 34th Infantry subsequently set up defensive fortifications along the Kum River, resting for several days until it was engaged in the Battle of Taejon, and were principally in charge of the defense of the city as the weakened 21st Infantry and 19th Infantry were less prepared for the fight. The battle at Taejon resulted in the near destruction of the 24th Infantry Division.Appleman 1998, p. 90. Although the force was badly defeated militarily, the 24th Infantry Division accomplished its mission of delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20. By that time, American forces had set up a defensive perimeter along the Naktong River and Taegu to the southeast, known as the Pusan Perimeter. This perimeter saw the next phase of the battle and the ultimate defeat of the North Korean army in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 101. Robert R. Martin, the 34th Infantry Regiment's commanding officer during the battle, was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at Chonan, the first such decoration awarded during the Korean War.Appleman 1998, p. 87.

Biography Fumerton was born in Fort-Coulonge, Quebec, and attended Shawville High School (now Pontiac High School) in Shawville, Quebec. Initially employed as a timber worker, he contracted diphtheria. He then spent seven years in the North-West Territories and the Yukon surveying, mapping, and gold prospecting. Service career In 1938 he obtained a pilot's licence and when war broke out he volunteered to be a pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Fumerton graduated as a pilot in July 1940 and arrived in England in August 1940 with No. 112 Squadron, flying the Westland Lysander. Fighter Command was so short of fighter pilots that he joined No. 32 Squadron RAF, flying Hurricanes. After the battle ended Fumerton moved to No. 1 Squadron. In June 1941 he transferred to night fighting duties and joined the newly formed No 406 (RCAF) Squadron, based in Northumberland. He then joined No. 89 Squadron in October 1941, flying night operations over Egypt and later Malta in June 1942. With his observer Sgt. Pat Bing, Fumerton became the island's top-scoring night fighter pilot, claiming nine victories by the end of August 1941. His first success over Malta came on the night of 24 June, an Italian bomber, before returning to refuel and rearm. Just before dawn he destroyed another bomber. Four nights later he accounted for two Junkers Ju 88s. On July 1 he downed a Ju 88, and the following night he shot down another near Gozo. On July 28 he shot down another Ju 88. On the night of 10 August, when taking off to attack a force of incoming bombers both his engines failed. He and Bing were forced to bale out over the sea, spending several hours in their dinghies before being rescued next morning by an air-sea rescue launch. He spent the first six months of 1943 in Canada, before returning to No. 406 Squadron RAF in August 1943. He returned, tour-expired, to Canada on 11 August 1944. Tally and awards Fumerton shot down 14 enemy aircraft, the highest tally among RCAF night fighter aces, being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar. He was also awarded an Air Force Cross for service as Commanding Officer of No. 7 OTU (Operational Training Unit) at Debert, Nova Scotia. Later career He retired from the RCAF in 1946, and Fumerton returned to mining. In 1948 he went to Hangkow to train Chinese pilots and organise the formation of squadrons for General Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Nationalist Air Force. He returned to Canada a year later and became an estate agent.

This building was the manufacturing site of Kendall's Spavin Cure, a patent medicine made at the turn of the century. The renovation has been put on hold for the present. The station was off the air for a number of years after vandals damaged the station and took key equipment. Broadcasting resumed April, 2011. The current programming format for WEVT-LP consists of classic 1950s and 1960s oldies. The station has put together a fairly good library of music, including many doo- opp hits of the 1950s. At night, the programming switches to classic and modern rock. On Sunday mornings and holidays WEVT-LP presents \\"American Popular Standards\\" featuring selections from the Big Band era and the Great American Songbook. Currently, WEVT-LP is the only station in Vermont offering an oldies or standards format. WEVT-LP can be heard in the town of Enosburgh and several surrounding towns, including Sheldon, Franklin, Berkshire, Richford, Montgomery, Bakersfield and Fairfield. WEVT-LP can also be heard on its website.

They wrote postcards denouncing Hitler's government and left them in public places around the city. They were eventually caught, tried, and beheaded in Berlin's Pl√∂tzensee Prison in April 1943. Shortly after the end of the war, their Gestapo file was given to German novelist Hans Fallada, and their story inspired his 1947 novel, translated into English and published in 2009 as Every Man Dies Alone (Alone in Berlin in the UK). The story was filmed in 2016 as Alone in Berlin.

After learning that Elise's brother had been killed in action, the Hampels undertook efforts to encourage resistance against the Third Reich. From September 1940 until their arrest in Autumn 1942, they hand-wrote over 200 postcards, dropping them into mailboxes and leaving them in stairwells in Berlin, often near Wedding, where they lived. The postcards urged people to refuse to cooperate with the Nazis, to refrain from donating money, to refuse military service, and to overthrow Hitler. Although nearly all the postcards were immediately brought to the Gestapo, it took two years for the authorities to find the couple.Johannes Groschupf, \\"Das Ehepaar Hampel allein in Berlin\\" (pg. 2) Die Zeit, 16 April 2011; retrieved 8 March 2012.

Retrieved 12 March 2010. TVB confirmed that three of their employees were involved, and that their duties and work had been suspended pending further development. Background Chan was said to control a shell company through his personal assistant to which he was alleged to have awarded production contracts from TVB. The shell company had no production facilities of its own but outsourced the work to other production houses at a much lower rate than it receives from TVB, pocketing the difference the shell company having accumulated as much as HK$10 million over the years. This outsourcing is itself thought to be unnecessary since TVB has the resources in house to handle these productions. One of the arrested is the manager of artist's contracts at TVB and using this position many actors and actresses had been asked to perform in major shows and other functions, and even ribbon cutting ceremonies for free or at very low pay in return for possible future favour. These artists included Bernice Liu, Moses Chan, Raymond Lam, Bosco Wong, Tavia Yeung and Charmaine Sheh. Prior to the arrest, in late February 2010, speculation existed that TVB deputy chairman Mona Fong had dropped Stephen Chan from her inner circle after he failed to accompany her to a variety show.The Standard HK. \\"The Standard.com .\\" Rumors rife over Chan for weeks. Retrieved 12 March 2010. Chan was also blamed over a copyright issue with the Hong Kong Recording Industry Alliance, and has not been popular with the staff after he laid off hundreds of employees in 2009. Many other artists however have expressed regrets in the situation. Arrests and release on bail Chan and the four other were arrested on 11 March 2010 and were released on bail without being charged, the next day. On 18 March 2010, Chan made a public appearance for the first time since his arrest. Chan said that the mask he wore while returning home was because of a shaving wound refuting media reports that it was related to his arrest. Chan also thanks those who sent text messages of support. Chan was cleared of charges relating to some activities at TVB in November 2010, but three other incidents relating to bribery and conspiracy to defraud are still being investigated. Chan resumed his TVB duties on 16 November, but his duties will not involve artist management and casting arrangement. Acquittal Following a trial Chan and his co-accused were acquitted of all charges in the September 2011. The prosecution could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Chan knew the details of a payment of HK$300,000 withheld from TVB and five actresses. The court also found that Chan was paid to be an administrator at TVB, and any renumeration he received from the Olympic City shopping mall was as a performer and this did not conflict with his role at TVB. Following Chan's acquittal a number of artists identified with the Chan faction at TVB have failed to have their contracts renewed.

M√≥zes Sz√©kely was killed on the battlefield, and the Wallachian lord Radu »òerban became ruler of Transylvania until September 1603, when Giorgio Basta and the imperial commissioners took control of the country in the name of the emperor.  Context  The decade previous to the battle was a tumultuous one for Transylvania, during which the Habsburg Empire seemed to be losing its grasp on the province. Prince Sigismund B√°thory was nominally elected to be its leader in 1581, at the age of nine, and between 1593 and 1601 he had abdicated the throne three times in favour of other members of the family in order to please the imperial interests. After brief spells during which Transylvania was controlled by Wallachian prince Michael the Brave and subsequently by mercenaries of Habsburg general Giorgio Basta, military leader Moses Sz√©kely instigated the native Transylvanian forces to rebel and, with the support of Turkish-Tartarian auxiliary forces proclaimed himself Prince of Transylvania on 8 May 1603. Sz√©kely's attempt to replace the Habsburg presence in Transylvania with a government that was friendly to the Ottoman Empire was unacceptable to Radu »òerban, who ‚Äùcould not allow Wallachia to be caught in a vice between the Ottoman Empire south of the Danube and a Transylvania that swore fealty to it‚Äù. Much of the Transylvanian nobility sided with »òerban, against the excesses of the Ottoman-backed usurper, with Bra»ôov itself remaining loyal to the Habsburg.  The battle  In July 1603 several smaller Wallachian-Habsburg forces crossed the Carpathians and engaged in skirmishes with Sz√©kely's troops around Feldioara, resulting in an early strategic victory. Unsure of his chances in open battle against the bulk of the Wallachian army, Sz√©kely adopts a defensive posture, entrenching his army (consisting of 4000 Hungarians, 2000 Tatars and 25 light cannons) near R√¢»ônov in an improvised camp surrounded by linked carts. On the 15th of July Radu »òerban crosses the mountains and joins the rest of the forces. In total, the Wallachian-Habsburg army consisted of 10,000 men: two flanks of 2000 soldiers each and a main army of 6000 men lead by »òerban himself. The main battle took place on 17 July, when the Wallachian troops attacked the defending camp. Following prolonged close combat, the defenders starting suffering heavy losses and broke ranks, attempting to flee. »òerban gave the order to follow and cut down those who were trying to escape This included M√≥zes Sz√©kely who, refusing to surrender, attempts to flee to Bra»ôov to save his life, but is caught by the Wallachian cavalry and executed.  Aftermath  Radu »òerban became ruler of Transylvania until September 1603. Despite initial fears from Giorgio Basta that »òerban will try to clam Transylvania for himself after the battle, mirroring Michael the Brave, Basta and the imperial commissioners took control of the country in the name of the emperor.  Depictions  The Battle of Bra»ôov is the most recent battle included in the Allegory of the Turkish War, a volume of oil sketches on parchment created by German painter Hans von Aachen around 1607, while he was acting as the court painter of Emperor Rudolf II.

India is a signatory of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). India is currently running one of the largest leprosy eradication program in the world, the National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP). Despite this, 120,000 to 130,000 new cases of leprosy are reported every year in India. This is 58.8% of the global total of new cases. Transmission, treatment and disability Leprosy is one of the least infectious diseases as nearly everyone has some measure of natural resistance against it.World Health Organization (2009): Leprosy. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/index.html Nevertheless, it continues to spread, partially due to its extremely long incubation period, which may last as long as 30 years, as well as widespread ignorance and misinformation about the symptoms and effects of the disease. Stigma against the disease due to its disfigurement causes its victims to be isolated and shunned. They may also isolate themselves out of fear of discrimination. Patients may be impacted in every area of their life, including interpersonal relationships, economic security, and mental health and wellbeing. Leprosy is also the leading cause of permanent disability in the world and is primarily a disease of the poor. The disease is now readily treatable with multi-drug therapy, which combines three drugs to kill the pathogen and cure the victim. Disability and disfigurement can be avoided if the disease is treated early, while conversely delay in treatment is linked to greater disability. Unfortunately, individuals with leprosy are still shunned, isolated, and stigmatised, leading to the fear of leprosy being worse than the disease itself. Additionally, the initial symptoms are not obvious and may easily be mistaken for other conditions, such as insect bites or allergic reactions. Patients may consider the disease too minor to warrant a visit to a doctor and fear losing their wages. People suffering from severe leprosy-related disabilities face extensive discrimination. Often, the only way they can make money is by begging. Under these conditions, they may mutilate themselves to garner more sympathy and therefore more money.Barrett, Ron. \\"Medical Anthropology: Leprosy on the Ganges.\\" Conformity and Conflict: Readings in Cultural Anthropology, edited by James Spradley and David W. McCurdy, 14th ed., Pearson, 2012, pp. 351-358. Sufferers may also hide their symptoms or diagnosis from their family or colleagues, have difficulty maintaining a job, or avoid physical contact with their family. Leprosy colonies exist throughout India. These are typically made up of patients that have moved to the colony from a significant distance away, and their children and grandchildren. These colonies have a very strong community bond, formed in reaction to outside discrimination.Poestges, Heide. \\"Leprosy, the Key to Another Kingdom.\\" Leprosy Review, vol. 82, no. 2, June 2011, pp. 155-167.

History  India is considered the point of origin of leprosy with skeletal evidence of the disease dating to 2000 B.C. The disease is thought to have spread through trade and war to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and later Europe and the Americas. In ancient Indian society, individuals suffering from leprosy were alienated because the disease was chronic, contagious, resulted in disfigurement, had no cure at the time, and was associated with sin. In colonial India, the government enacted the Lepers Act, 1898,Text of the Act from the Indian Lawyer which institutionalised leprosy victims and separated them based on gender to prevent reproduction. These laws mainly affected the poor because those who were self-sufficient were not obligated to be isolated or seek medical treatment. In 1991, India contained 75% of the world's leprosy cases. Leprosy treatment was handled by the National Leprosy Elimination Programme, which was completely separated from other healthcare services. In 2005, this was incorporated into the broader healthcare system, and shortly afterwards, India announced that it had eliminated leprosy as a public health problem. However, this only means that there is less than 1 person in 10,000 infected with the disease. There is a lower percentage of affected individuals, but this number is still enormous in absolute terms, and India still makes up 58.8% of the world's leprosy cases. Since this announcement, funding for leprosy prevention and education programs has been drastically reduced. The prevalence and rate of infection have remained steady from 2005 to 2015, and there are still significant delays in treatment, both from the patients and the healthcare system itself, due to a lack of knowledge about the disease. Current programs include house-to-house examinations designed to identify hidden cases of leprosy. Legal discrimination The historical legacy and societal stigma toward leprosy are evidenced by various laws containing discriminatory clauses against leprosy victims. Laws in the states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Orissa prohibit leprosy patients from running in local elections.Putul, A. (2008): Laws in India Criminalise Leprosy.OneWorld South Asia. http://southasia.oneworld.net/Article/laws-in-india-criminalise- leprosy Other laws include the Motor Vehicle Act of 1939 which restricts leprosy patients from obtaining a driving license and the Indian Rail Act of 1990 which prohibits leprosy patients from traveling by train. Over 100 discriminatory laws were challenged in a plea by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy on December 4, 2017. The Supreme Court recommended the matter to the attention of the government, following up on a previous Law Commission report.\\"Supreme Court notice on petition to repeal 144 laws against leprosy patients.\\" Economic Times, 5 Dec. 2017.

The specific laws and regulations named included Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which permits leprosy as a justification for divorce; Section 70(3)(b) of the Orissa Municipal Corporation Act, which prevents leprosy patients from running for the office of Corporator; and other similar laws.\\"Discrimination against leprosy patients: SC seeks govt response on plea.\\" Times of India, 5 Dec. 2017.

Accessed 8 July 2019. Many of these laws were written before the development of multi-drug therapy (MDT), a treatment that can make leprosy patients non- contagious and prevent further deterioration, and they have not been updated since. For example, almost all of the marriage and divorce laws of India consider leprosy as grounds for divorce with the Special Marriage Act of 1954 declaring leprosy \\"incurable.\\" These laws do not reflect the current understanding of leprosy.

Completed in 1924, it is owned and operated by Detroit Edison, a subsidiary of DTE Energy. Location Part of the facility's property is on the mainland surrounding West Jefferson Avenue in southern Wayne County. The main building ‚Äì the two-smokestack power station ‚Äì and the coal yard are located on what is now technically the southern portion of Slocum's Island in the Detroit River. The facility shares this island with Elizabeth Park, which is separated from the facility by Grosse Ile Parkway. The Trenton Channel Power Station and the affiliated Sibley Quarry occupy of land along the Detroit River, in which of that property is open fields, woods, ponds, and sound berms. Environment The characteristic striped smokestacks were constructed with an innovative ‚Äúsmokestack within a smokestack‚Äù design to reduce the level of pollutants released. However, to better achieve this, the inner smokestacks were lined with asbestos that had to be later removed at great cost. Despite its nature, the power plant works closely with environmental organizations to ensure the area is free of pollutants. Committed to reducing pollution and preserving the environment around Elizabeth Park, the Trenton Channel Power Plant became ISO 14001 certified in 2001. In 2002, the facility was designated a corporate wildlife habitat by the Wildlife Habitat Council. For their efforts, the Trenton Channel Power Plant and Sibley Quarry were co-awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's Corporate Habitat of the Year award in 2004. The Trenton Channel Power Plant has also donated money and worked closely with Elizabeth Park and the Wayne County Department of Public Services for continued ecological preservation. DTE Energy spreads crushed limestone along the banks of the Detroit River on Slocum's Island, because such an item provides a popular nesting habitat for native common terns. Common terns were once plentiful in the region before industrialism drove out all but a small number of them. The banks of the Detroit River near the Trenton Channel Power Plant are one of the only places in the region where common terns regularly nest and breed. Other birds, such as bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and great blue herons also use the grounds for habitat. History The Trenton Channel Power Plant was first fired up in 1924. It had 6 turbine generators with 13 coal- fired boilers. There was space for 2 additional boilers, but they were never needed. Operating conditions were 725 ¬∞F and 420 psi. The sixth and last turbine generator arrived by 1929. Each unit produced a rated 50 megawatts of electricity. Five short smoke stacks exhausted gases from the boilers. These were the first Detroit Edison units to use pulverized coal rather than the older style stoker-fired beds of coal. They were also the first power plants in the US to use electrostatic precipitators to capture fly ash from the stacks. Electrostatic precipitators were, however, in use in other industries at the time. In 1950, a second plant started up at the same site and adjoined the first plant. It had two turbine generators, #7 and #8, with a rating of 120 megawatts each. They were fed by a total of 4 boilers. The boilers ran at higher steam conditions than the first plant, at 950 ¬∞F and about 1250 psi. Therefore, the first plant became known as the \\"low side\\", while the newer plant was known as the \\"high side\\". The high side was located to the south of the low side. Two short smoke stacks released gases from the four boilers. Finally in 1968, Unit #9 was placed in service. It is a 550-megawatt turbine generator fed by a single boiler. It adjoins the high side plant and is located on the south side. Operating conditions are 1000 ¬∞F and 2520 psi. One 563-foot-tall smoke stack is used for this unit. Soon afterwards, another stack, identical to the #9 stack, was erected to replace the two short stacks on the high side plant. Both tall stacks remain in service as of 2012. Decommissioned By the mid-1970s, the low side plant was decommissioned and the boiler house was eventually demolished. In the 2010s, all generators except #9 were closed. The plant is scheduled to be closed completely by 2023 as DTE changes to natural gas and renewable energy plants.DTE to shut down three coal plants within 7 years, Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press, June 8, 2016 Trenton Channel power plant in 2007 See also * List of power stations in Michigan ReferencesExternal links * EPA Facility Detail Report for the Trenton Channel Power Plant Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1924 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1929 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1950 Category:1924 establishments in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Wayne County, Michigan Category:Metro Detroit Category:Coal-fired power stations in Michigan Category:DTE Energy ","title":"Trenton Channel Power Plant"},{"id":"26572480","text":"Empire Block may refer to: *Empire Block (Pendleton, Oregon), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Umatilla County, Oregon *Empire Block (Superior, Wisconsin), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Douglas County, Wisconsin ","title":"Empire Block"},{"id":"26572486","text":"Location of Douglas County in Wisconsin This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Douglas County, Wisconsin.

Background Reilly was born to Protestant Irish immigrants, the 13th of 16 children of James Reilly and Mary Jane Whiteside, and his family settled in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and ran a grocery store. His wife, Hilda Beulah Huffman, died in 1978. He was the father of Lenore, Lynne and stepson, Nick, and he was predeceased by daughter Lois. Before politics, he was a locksmith, taking on a career after high school and learning from an older brother who had opened Reilly Lock on Yonge Street. He ultimately went on to manage and co-own the business, which grew to become one of the largest locksmithing companies in Toronto, with over 40 employees. Reilly had a keen interest in public speaking and Reilly developed and owned the Reilly Institute of Effective Public Speaking.Advertisement. Toronto Daily Star. September 14, 1945. During the late 1940s and 1950s, Reilly was a Toronto alderman. He was licensed as a private pilot and, on March 17, 1958, while flying a small plane in Florida, the plane experienced an engine failure and he was forced to land on the beach at Ft. Lauderdale. He passed his last driver's license test at age 95. Politics He first entered political life in 1947, running as an aldermanic candidate. He was elected as one of two councillors in Ward 9 in Toronto. He was re-elected as a councillor in 1948, but he lost in 1949 when he attempted to secure one of the four positions on the Board of Control. In 1951, he returned to municipal politics, winning acclamation as a councillor in Ward 9, a position he successfully defended in the elections in 1952, 1953 and 1954. He chose not to run in the 1955 election. Reilly was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the riding of Eglinton in a by-election on January 18, 1962. The by-election was called to replace William Dunlop who died in office in 1961. He won the seat, barely beating his Liberal opponent, Jean Newman, by 38 votes. During his term of office he served as the Deputy Speaker (1966) and as the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Industry and Tourism in October 1972. He also acted as Chief Party Whip. He won his first election by the slim margin of 35 votes, but in 1963 he won by over 6,000. He won by a bigger margin again in 1967 and in his last election, in 1971, he won by over 10,000 votes. In 1975, he retired from provincial politics. After Politics After he left politics, he was made chair of the board of trustees of the Ontario Science Centre, where he served two three-year terms until 1983. He is credited with raising the international profile of the Ontario Science Centre, and oversaw the exhibition China: 7,000 Years of Discovery, that broke all previous attendance records, attracting more than 1.5 million visitors in 1982. A very spiritual man, Reilly organized the first Ontario Prayer Breakfast in 1970. It is now an annual event, held in Toronto, and it recently celebrating its 42nd year. He died at Sunnybrook Hospital in 2008. He was 95 years old.

The river flows eastward through the Hondo Valley in the foothills of the Sierra Blanca and Capitan Mountains, roughly paralleling the route of U.S. Route 70 through the towns of Picacho and Tinnie. Near the community of Riverside the river passes through a deep canyon before entering the rolling hills west of Roswell. Approximately southwest of Roswell the river enters an Army Corps of Engineers flood control reservoir known as the Two Rivers Dam. The reservoir is typically dry except during the spring runoff. The reservoir also contains the runoff of Rocky Arroyo, an intermittent stream that parallels the Rio Hondo a few miles to the south. Two earth fill dams totaling in length have the capacity to impound of water. The two dams act as two separate reservoirs, one for the Rio Hondo and one for Rocky Arroyo unless the water level is very high. Then the Rio Hondo and Rocky Arroyo reservoirs merge into a single large reservoir.http://wrri.nmsu.edu/publish/watcon/proc10/Slingerland.pdf After passing through the reservoir, the Rio Hondo begins to meander through the flat land of the Pecos River valley. Rocky Arroyo merges with the Rio Hondo west of the Roswell International Air Center then the Hondo travels northeasterly through Roswell. In many areas the natural route of the river has been altered. This is especially true in the city of Roswell where the river has been lined with concrete or paving stones. In Roswell a small tributary, the Spring River, joins the Hondo. Just east of Roswell another tributary, the Berrendo River, also joins, and downstream from there the Rio Hondo empties into the Pecos River near Bottomless Lakes State Park. The upper stretch of the river typically flows year-round, however irrigation along the length of the river siphons off much of the natural flow. By the time the river reaches Roswell it is dry, except after storms and during the spring runoff from the mountains.

From 1988-1994, he studied film at the German Film and Television Academy Berlin (dffb) where he studied with mentors who \\"included filmmakers, media artists, and media theorists Harun Farocki and Hartmut Bitomsky, who are both known for their non-narrative films, video work, and film installations in galleries and museums.\\" While at dffb, Petzold appeared in Thomas Arslan's short experimental film 19 Portr√§ts (1990), a 16-millimeter black-and-white film in the tradition of Andy Warhol's Screen Tests. His first film was Pilotinnen, which he directed for his film school graduation in 1995. In 2005, his film Gespenster was presented at the Berlin International Film Festival, as was his 2007 film Yella. Petzold writes his own scenarios, often collaborating with Harun Farocki. As his former teacher at dffb, Farocki was a major influence on Petzold, who, along with Angela Schanelec and Thomas Arslan, is generally considered to be part of the Berlin School. While the Berlin School is often associated with a new turn towards realism and political cinema, Petzold's films, while they address issues of work and employment, also deal with conflicts between life and death. In Gespenster the protagonist leads a ghost- like existence.Petzold im Interview auf der Webpr√§senz des Films Gespenster In Yella the protagonist is, possibly, already dead at the beginning of the film. These three films came to be called the \\"Gespenster Trilogy\\".Filmzentrale: ‚ÄûIm Zwischenreich‚Äú The 2008 film Jerichow was his fourth collaboration with Nina Hoss after Something to Remind Me (German: Toter Mann), Wolfsburg and Yella. The drama concerns a soldier who, having returned from Afghanistan to Prignitz, becomes involved in a relationship with a married woman. The movie was nominated in the main competition at the 65th Venice International Film Festival in 2008. In 2009, Petzold received a 'best director' nomination for the Deutscher Filmpreis award.Welt Online, 13.

It originally aired on March 22, 2010. Chuck faces his final test as a spy, under the watchful eyes of Sarah and Shaw. Meanwhile, Casey must readjust to his life as a civilian. Plot summary=Main Plot As the episode begins, Chuck corners a rogue agent fleeing outside a train station and aims a gun on him. The man begs for his life but Chuck warns him that he had his chance, and a shot rings out. Three days earlier, Chuck arrives in Castle after promising Casey to help him get reinstated, hoping to gain Sarah's support in strong-arming Beckman into doing so. However, as he arrives, Sarah, Shaw and Beckman advise him that he will be undergoing his final test - a last solo mission to determine if he is ready to be a spy. The morning after, Sarah briefs him at his apartment with a message from Beckman. Chuck is to find an ex-FSB agent-turned information broker named Anatoli Zevlovski, who is contacting a mole within the CIA providing information to the Ring. Chuck and Sarah meet to stakeout the hotel where Zevlovski is staying, and they nearly miss him when Chuck tries to talk with her about what happened in Prague (in \\"Chuck Versus the Pink Slip\\"), and asks her for a second chance to be together. Chuck and Sarah, who are just about to share a kiss, are interrupted by Shaw, who orders Chuck to infiltrate the hotel where Zevlovski is waiting in the steam room with two of his men. A hotel clerk delivers a message to him, which Zevlovski crumples up and throws on the floor before leaving with his guards. As Chuck recovers it, the two goons spot him, but Chuck flashes and defeats them, before hurrying after Zevlovski. Chuck gains access to the hotel room next door to the mole's and slips out onto the balcony where he watches the mole dispatch Zevlovski. Chuck manages to get a glimpse of his face, and Shaw and Sarah (watching on a feed from Chuck's glasses) identify him as Hunter Perry. The next morning, Chuck heads to Orange Orange to ask Sarah out on a celebratory date, but she asks him to dinner first. They arrange to meet at a restaurant later that evening. He then returns to the Buy More and tells an uncertain Casey he passed his spy test, and thanks him for the help he's given him. In return, Chuck gives Casey back his gun, which he lifted (illegally) from Castle. Shaw reveals to Sarah that Chuck must now complete his \\"red test\\", by killing Perry, against Sarah's objections. That night she tells Chuck they're not on a date but that he has one final test, and orders him to eliminate the mole, who will be meeting him shortly. Sarah leaves and Perry arrives. As Sarah had warned Chuck, he is suspicious and promptly excuses himself to go to the bathroom. Chuck follows and after being ambushed in the restroom, he flashes and disarms his opponent. Chuck is unable to kill Perry when he protests he has no choice but to work for the Ring, and arrests him instead. Perry attempts to flee and Chuck gives chase through the train station. The two end in a footrace outside the station, as seen in the beginning of the episode, with Chuck eventually cornering Perry. He once again hesitates, and Perry attempts to use this as a chance to draw his gun on Chuck. However, Casey shoots Perry first from the shadows. Though Chuck sees him, Sarah arrives and is stunned, believing Chuck went through with the killing. Later that evening, Casey warns Chuck not to tell anyone what happened. Without government sanction he has committed murder, and Chuck has \\"cheated\\" on his \\"red test.\\" Chuck tries to call Sarah to follow up on their conversation from earlier, but she refuses the call. When Shaw asks if she still loves Chuck, she tells him not anymore, fearing that Chuck will never be the same again, and relates her own experiences on her \\"red test.\\" At his apartment, Chuck receives orders from Beckman to fly to Washington D.C. to be inducted as an agent and receive his assignment. Casey Casey is experiencing difficulties readjusting to civilian life following his dismissal. He assaults Jeff and Lester when he catches the two goofing off at the store, and despite his threats, they intend to sue him and the store. Big Mike takes it upon himself to rein Casey in an attempt to help him smooth over his \\"jagged edges\\" with a new suit, and by apologizing to his coworkers. Big Mike mediates between them, and Jeff and Lester agree to drop the lawsuit after humiliating Casey by making him buy them lunch, and bonding with him by sharing a \\"tunaroni\\" sandwich with Jeff. Production=Production details * Casey mentions that his killing of Perry on Chuck's behalf was unsanctioned murder, in reference to a \\"license to kill\\". Although popularized by the James Bond novels and films, the reality of such a concept is far more legally complicated. * The stakeout scene with Chuck and Sarah references the first-season episode \\"Chuck Versus the Sizzling Shrimp\\". Flashes * Chuck flashes on grappling combat techniques when confronted by Zevlovski's two henchmen in the sauna. * Chuck has another flash on knife combat when ambushed by Perry in the restroom, allowing Chuck to disarm and defeat him. Reception Alan Sepinwall of the Star-Ledger continued to praise the direction of the series after the post-Olympics break. He noted a number of moments requiring suspension of disbelief, but considered it worth the effort due to its blend of suspense, comedy, romance, and self-reference to the beginning of the series. References to popular culture * Zevlovski uses the alias Ivan Drago while staying at the hotel. Ivan Drago was the antagonist in the film, Rocky IV, and Chuck comments on the silliness of using such a name. * The sauna fight, including the tattoos, is reminiscent of the famous fight scene in Eastern Promises. * The fight between Chuck and Perry in the restroom when Chuck is given his \\"red test\\" is similar to that of James Bond's first kill assignment at the beginning of Casino Royale. * The videos Chuck watches to obtain his missions self-destruct after viewing, similar to assignments in Mission: Impossible. *The end scene in which Chuck and Casey train is also in reference to Rocky 3  References  External links  * * Final Exam Category:2010 American television episodes ","title":"Chuck Versus the Final Exam"},{"id":"26572833","text":"\\"Chuck Versus the American Hero\\" is the 12th episode of the third season of Chuck. It first aired on March 29, 2010. Chuck is given a week's paid leave before being sent on his first mission as a real agent, and chooses to use that time in an effort to win back Sarah's heart. Plot summary=Main plot Chuck arrives in Washington, D.C. to be briefed on his new assignment in Rome and Beckman grants him a week's leave before shipping out when Chuck admits he doesn't feel he's ready. Beckman reveals that Chuck is not going to Rome alone, but will be allowed to assemble a team of agents of his choice. Chuck returns to Burbank, to meet the one person he wants most - Sarah. Devon wants Chuck out of Burbank so Ellie also feels comfortable leaving. Morgan also agrees to help win Sarah back. They are soon joined by Casey, who sees Chuck's freedom in choosing his team as a chance to regain his government position. The three resolve to get Chuck and Sarah back together, but his first attempt fails when Sarah responds icily to his promotion. She admits after seeing him \\"kill\\" Hunter Perry, he's no longer the same man she fell in love with. Morgan, Casey and Devon refuse to let him quit, and borrow Jeff's spy gear-equipped van to kidnap Chuck and stakeout Sarah and Shaw on a date. While Morgan draws Shaw out of the restaurant by calling him in the guise of a Ring agent, Chuck moves in and lays out how he feels to Sarah. Shaw finds Morgan and the two are assaulted by actual Ring agents. Shaw attempts to get back to the restaurant to warn Sarah of the attack but is intercepted by other agents seeking to bring him in to the Director. Devon, thinking Shaw is going to interfere with Chuck and is unaware of the situation, tackles Shaw and they smash through a window, temporarily rescuing Shaw but disrupting Chuck's talk with Sarah. The next morning, Ellie angrily confronts Chuck about coming to Devon, Casey and Morgan about Sarah and not her, and orders him not to give up on Sarah. Back at Castle, Shaw announces his intent to use himself as bait to target the Ring and its senior leadership in revenge for his wife's death. General Beckman approves of the plan, despite Sarah's objection that this is a suicide mission, saying Shaw will be a \\"true American hero\\", hence the episode title. Shaw swallows a tracking device to use as a target for an air strike and contacts the Director and agrees to come in. Chuck arrives as Shaw gives Sarah a goodbye kiss, and Shaw leaves after telling Chuck to take care of her. Sarah explains Shaw's intent to sacrifice himself, and that he can't be allowed to go alone. Chuck locks down Castle to trap her there, promising that Shaw won't be alone, then leaves to help Shaw. Sarah uses the connection between Castle and the Buy More to send a message to Casey, who soon arrives to free her from lockdown. Shaw arrives at the rendezvous, where the Director's men forcibly extract the tracking device and take him to the compound where the Director is waiting. Chuck arrives and finds the tracker, and tipped off by Jeff and Lester (who were stalking Shaw after feeling left out of Chuck's efforts to get back Sarah), follows the Ring agents to their compound. In the bunker, the Director reveals to Shaw that before his death, Hunter Perry was smuggling stolen surveillance footage of Shaw's wife's death and plays it for him. Shaw snaps when the video shows that Sarah was the one to kill his wife and attacks the Director, who reveals he was never actually in the room, but that Shaw was interacting with a hologram. Shaw is then knocked unconscious. Meanwhile Chuck arrives as a B-2 begins its bombing run on the building. He fights his way through several Ring agents and rescues Shaw. Sarah pulls up in her car just in time to watch a bomb strike the building, and sees Chuck emerge unharmed with Shaw slung across his shoulders. Back at Castle, Beckman congratulates Sarah, who admits that everything was done by Chuck. Chuck once again lays everything out to her and tells her that he loves her and wants to be with her, and repeats Sarah's previous offer in Prague by asking her to meet at the train station to run away together. He leaves her with a kiss and lets her make her own decision. Later, Casey arrives at Sarah's apartment to find her packing, and admits he was the one who killed Perry, noting that Chuck \\"didn't have the stones\\" to pull the trigger. At this confession, Sarah's face lights up, and she thanks Casey, who responds with wishing her a good life as he departs. Before Sarah can leave to meet Chuck, Shaw arrives at her apartment, having escaped from the hospital, and tells her they have a new mission. While Chuck waits for her at Union Station, he is recalled by Beckman to Castle, where she shows him the video implicating Sarah in Evelyn Shaw's death. Chuck is shocked to realize that Shaw now knows the truth, and that Sarah is with him and in danger. The episode ends as Shaw drives Sarah out to an undisclosed location to \\"settle an old score.\\" Production Actor Mark Sheppard's casting was first indicated on December 10, 2009, and later confirmed by Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune. More details emerged in an interview with ifmagazine.com, in which Sheppard confirmed he will be playing the Director of the Ring. Production details * The episode confirms that the unidentified woman Sarah shot as part of her red test was Evelyn Shaw, Daniel Shaw's wife. Chuck Versus the Final Exam * This is the first time Beckman's office has been visited by any character other than Director Graham or Shaw. * After Devon, Casey and Morgan return home from spending the night in jail, Ellie comments on Casey's \\"public indecency.\\" This is in reference to \\"Chuck Versus Operation Awesome,\\" where to cover Devon's disappearance, Chuck tells her he was bailing Casey out of jail after he got drunk and arrested for public indecency. Flashes * Chuck flashes on the necessary code to enter into the vending machine at the Ring's base to activate the elevator. * A flash on martial arts allows him to defeat the Director's henchmen and gain access to Shaw. Chuck notes \\"No flash necessary!\\" as he tranquilizes a Ring agent, emphasizing the progress in his marksmanship skills.

It was offered for distinguished achievements in eight different fields: literature, music, fine arts, business and industry (such as banker Anthony Overton in 1927), science and innovation, education (for example, educator Janie Porter Barrett in 1929), religious service, and race relations. Although awards were created in eight categories, it is best known for its impact on African-American art of the Harlem Renaissance, and particularly on the visual arts. During its existence the Harmon award was largely considered synonymous with Negro visual art: > ...the introduction of the Harmon foundation awards in 1926, which were > always dispensed with a flurry of publicity, marked the beginning of a new > era for Negro visual art. With its private endowment, popular social > mission, and interracial alliances, [it] possessed a much greater public > relations capacity than any other prior initiatives....Due in large part to > the activities of the Harmon Foundation, African Americans emerged as a > distinct presence in the American art world.Calo, p. 75. Among the many recipients of the awards in literature and the fine arts were Claude McKay, Hale Woodruff, Palmer Hayden, Archibald Motley (his winning piece was The Octoroon Girl), Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes. The awards were closely associated with an annual Exhibition of the Work of Negro Artists, conceived by Mary Brady. Exhibitions were held in 1927 through 1931, 1933, and 1935, and featured \\"substantial prizes\\" together with gold, silver and bronze medals.Gates and Higginbotham, p. 3; Driskell, p. 87.

Their intention was to waive the requirement that the award be granted solely for works completed during the previous year. However, the Harmon Foundation did not accept this proposal, and Chesnutt never learned of this \\"acknowledgment of high esteem from a distinguished panel of his literary peers both black and white.\\"Gates & Higginbotham, p. 114.

If the full House votes to approve a legislative rule that contains such a provision, the House then deems a second piece of legislation as approved without requiring a separate vote, as long as it is specified in the rule. That is, if the vote on the rule passes, then the second piece of legislation is passed as part of the rule vote. When considering a bill for debate, the House must first adopt a rule for the debate as proposed by the House Rules Committee. This rule comes in the form of a resolution which specifies which issues or bills are to be considered by the House. If the House votes to approve a rule that contains a self-executing provision, it simultaneously agrees to dispose of the separate matter as specified by the rule. For example, modifications or amendments can be approved while the underlying bill is also approved at the same time. The procedure is often used to streamline the legislative process, although some legal scholars question whether the process is constitutional. Uses The self-executing rule began in the 1930s. From the 95th to the 98th Congresses (1977‚Äì1984) the self-executing rule was used eight times; it was then used 20 times under House Speaker Tip O‚ÄôNeill (D) in the 99th Congress, and 18 times under Speaker Jim Wright (D) in the 100th. Under Speaker Newt Gingrich (R) there were 38 self-executing rules in the 104th Congress and 52 in the 105th (1995‚Äì1998). Under Speaker Dennis Hastert (R) there were 40 self-executing rules in the 106th Congress, 42 in the 107th and 30 in the 108th (1999‚Äì2007). In March 2010, the procedure was one option considered, but then rejected, by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) and congressional Democrats to pass the Reconciliation Act of 2010 () and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (), as part of President Obama's health care reform initiative. Legal arguments Some analysts have questioned the constitutionality of the self-executing rule. Some lawyers and public advocacy groups cite the 1998 Supreme Court case Clinton v. City of New York relating to the line item veto, and the 1983 case Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha 462 U.S. 919 (1983) relating to the legislative veto to support these claims. Others point to a 2006 case before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia regarding the Deficit Reduction Act, which, in part, ruled in favor of the self-executing provision. That ruling was upheld on appeal in 2007, but was never argued before the Supreme Court.

There are four main types of wakefieldite- wakefieldite-(La), wakefieldite-(Ce), wakefieldite-(Nd), and wakefieldite-(Y), depending upon the dominant rare-earth metal ion present. Wakefieldite has a Mohs hardness ranging from 4 to 5.The Mineral and Locality Database, Wakefieldite-(La). Wakefieldite forms crystals of tetragonal structure. In terms of crystal structure, it is the vanadate analog of the rare-earth phosphate mineral xenotime. Unlike xenotime, it is more favorable for wakefieldite to contain the lighter rare-earth elements over the heavier ones. Due to the lanthanide contraction, the heavier rare earths have smaller ionic radii than the lighter ones. When the phosphate anion is replaced by the larger vanadate anion, the tetragonal crystal system preferentially accommodates the larger light rare- earth elements.Miyawaki R., and I. Nakai.

He is traditionally regarded as the founder of the Pallava dynasty. Ilandiraiyan is referred to in the literature of the Sangam period and is the hero of some of the poems in the Pathupattu. He was a poet himself and four of his songs are extant even today. He ruled from Tondaimandalam and was known as 'Tondaman'. According to historian S. Krishnaswami Aiyengar, the Pallavas were natives of Tondaimandalam and the name Pallava is identical with the word Tondaiyar. Life According to the Sangam epic Manimekalai, a son was born to the Chola king Killi and the naga princess Pilivalai, the daughter of king Valaivanan of Manipallavam. When the boy grew up the princess wanted to send her son to the Chola kingdom. So she entrusted the prince to a merchant who dealt in woolen blankets called Kambala Chetty when his ship stopped in the island of Manipallavam. During the voyage to the Chola kingdom, the ship was wrecked due to rough weather and the boy was lost. He was later found washed ashore with a Tondai twig (creeper) around his leg. So he came to be called Tondaiman Ilam Tiraiyan meaning the young one of the seas or waves. When he grew up the northern part of the Chola kingdom was entrusted to him and the area he governed came to be called Tondaimandalam after him. He is considered by some scholars to be the progenitor of the Pallava dynasty and the dynasty he founded took its name after the native place of his mother, that is Manipallavam. According to the Ulas(historical poems in honor of Chola kings) written by poet Ottakoothar, Killivalavan is said to have married a Naga princess by entering the bilvadara(cave) and also it is known that Tiraiyan was the son of a Chola prince who married the Naga princess, Pilivalai by entering the bilvadara in Nagapattinam. So that Tiraiyan was the son of Killivalavan is not without force\\". According to P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Ilandiraiyan ascended the throne of Kanchi during the reign of the Chola king Karikalan and was probably, a feudatory of the latter.  In poetry  Uruttiragannanar who wrote the Pa·π≠·π≠i·πâappƒÅlai, gives a vivid description of Ilandiraiyan's kingdom and capital city of Kanchi in his poem PerumpƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πü·πüuppa·π≠ai. He advises \\"poets seeking rewards\\" to go to the court of Tondaiman Ilandiraiyan, \\"the great patron of bards\\". The PerumpƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πü·πüuppa·π≠ai contains 500 lines in the akaval metre eulogising Ilandiraiyan as well as providing a mythical origin for the Tondaiman clan. Ilandiraiyan was also a poet himself with four of his songs still extant. One of them is on the importance of personal character and its benefits on good rule.

If a river flows into a lake or sea, it is the region in which the slope of the river decreases because the lower water flux permitted at the mouth causes the water to back up. Where the river outlet is strongly affected by tides, the cyclic change in base level changes the portion of the river that is a backwater.

Sandarmokh (; ) is a forest massif from Medvezhyegorsk in the Republic of Karelia where thousands of victims of Stalin's Great Terror were executed. Over 9,000 people of more than 58 nationalities were shot and buried there in 236 communal pits over a 14-month period in 1937 and 1938. A thousand of the victims were from the Solovki special prison in the White Sea. It was long thought that the barges carrying them were deliberately sunk on the way to the mainland, drowning all the prisoners on board. Today Sandarmokh is a memorial to the crimes of Stalin and his regime and since 1998 has been the focus of an international Day of Remembrance on 5 August every year.\\"Sandarmoh, 1937-1938\\", heninen.netText about Sandarmokh, translated from \\"Virtual Museum of the Gulag\\", on Dmitriev Affair website.  Discovery and remembrance  On 27 October 1937, 1,116 prisoners were loaded onto three barges and taken from Solovki to the mainland. Only in 1996, thanks to the efforts of Venyamin Ioffe (1938-2002), co-chairman of the Memorial research centre in St Petersburg, documents were found in the archives of the Arkhangelsk department of the Federal Security Service (FSB) throwing light on the subsequent fate of the \\"first Solovki transport\\". These included the lists of those men and women who were to be shot. (One died before he could be executed; four more were sent to other parts of the Gulag.) After years of work on the ground in Karelia by Yury A. Dmitriev, this documentary evidence pointed the way to the identification on 1 July 1997 of the Solovki prisoners' last resting place and that of another 8,000 executed individuals. The location would subsequently be given the local (Karelian) name \\"Sandarmokh\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Sandormokh\\"). The story of that search and discovery was told in 2017 by Irina Flige, head of the Memorial Education and Information Centre in St Petersburg.Anna Yarovaya, \\"The Dmitriev Affair\\", Rights in Russia, 20 March 2017 and The Russian Reader, 1 March 2017.

According to documents found in the FSB archives in Arkhangelsk, there were people of 58 nationalities among those shot at Sandarmokh. Three hundred monuments have been erected around the site since 1997 to commemorate the many victims of this killing field, individually and as representatives of particular nations and cultures,\\"Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges\\" CNN, July 17, 1997–£—Ä–æ—á–∏—â–µ –°–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–º–æ—Ö. –ó–∞—Ö–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤ –º–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Ä–µ–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–π (1937‚Äî1938 –≥–≥.) and an international Day of Remembrance has been held there every 5 August since 1998.

Those shot at Sandarmokh, 1937-1938  The thousands executed over 14 months from October 1937 to December 1938 fall into three broad groups. Many were from Karelia. More were prisoners or \\"special settlers\\" (i.e. peasants exiled to the North after the collectivisation of agriculture) who worked on the White Sea Canal. A smaller group was brought there from Solovki. According to the archives, wrote Dmitriev, more than nine thousand men and women were shot at Sandarmokh during this period:Anatoly Razumov (n.d.), \\"The Solovki transports, 1937-1938\\", Returning the Names website (in Russian). > 3,500 were inhabitants of Karelia, 4,500 were prisoners working for the > White Sea - Baltic Canal, and 1,111 were brought here from the Solovki > special prison. Alongside hard-working peasants, fishermen and hunters from > nearby villages, there were writers and poets, scientists and scholars, > military leaders, doctors, teachers, engineers, clergy of all confessions > and statesmen who found their final resting place here. Among the last named group were prominent members of the intelligentsia from the many national and ethnic cultures of the USSR‚Äîfor example, Finns, Karelians, and Volga Germans.

Victims and executioners Commemorative photos fixed to trees around the pits at Sandarmokh. It is often said or assumed of Soviet mass executions that they were carried out by firing squad. For the Soviet regime and, later, the Third Reich, this method of execution was the exception, not the rule.See, for instance, John le Carre, Smiley's People, 1980, where a Soviet character's execution is \\"by firing squad\\". From early days onwards, the preferred Soviet method of quick despatch was to dig a trench and then, the executioner standing immediately behind the upright or kneeling victim, shoot the victims at point blank range in the back of the head. This was the famous \\"nine grammes of lead\\". The victims tumbled into the trench and were buried; sometimes another, control shot (–∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≤—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª, kontrolnyi vystrel) was fired into the victim's head to make sure he or she was dead, sometimes only one shot was used. (A rare, extended description by a former executioner of how such mass killings were organised can be found in Lev Razgon's 1988 memoirs.)Chapter Two, \\"Niyazov\\", Lev Razgon, True Stories‚ÄîMemoirs of a Survivor, Souvenir Press: London, 1997, pp. 21-34. Published in Russian in 1988. This was the method used at Sandarmokh, Krasny Bor and Svirlag in the late 1930s, as the skulls found at these sites amply testify. Cross-examined while under arrest in 1939, the chief executioner Mikhail Matveyev said he made the victims lie face down in the prepared trench and then shot them.Nikita Petrov, \\"The butchers of Sandarmokh\\", Novaya gazeta, No. 84, 4 August 2017, pp. 8-9 . Yury Dmitriev went one step further than many who have attempted, since the late 1980s, to commemorate the victims of the Stalin years. Together with Razumov he also published, to the indignation of their descendants and, some suggest, of the present regime,Maria Shchur, interview with Georgy Lukyanchuk, Radio Svoboda, 2 August 2017 . the names of the members of the troika which rubber-stamped decisions to shoot a list of individuals‚Äîthe accused were not present at these sessions, no one defended their rights‚Äîand of the execution squad leaders.Anatoly Razumov, Skorbny put: Solovetskie etapy, 1937-1938 , Appendix 2: Those involved in selecting and shooting the Solovki transports, pp. 36-40.\\"Krasny Bor, 1937-1938\\", heninen.net. The man sent from Leningrad on 16 October 1937 to organise the shooting of the Solovki transport, Matveyev, was an experienced NKVD executioner. He was succeeded at Sandarmokh by I.A. Bondarenko and his deputy A.F. Shondysh. Matveyev survived into old age; his successors were both arrested in 1938 and shot in 1939 for \\"exceeding their authorisation\\". Proposed new digs and an alternative hypothesis Starting in 2016, there were attempts to revise this account of the shootings at Sandarmokh, and claim that among the dead were Soviet POWs shot by the invading Finns in 1941-1944. There were newspaper articles and TV broadcasts in Russia; there was also a publication in the Finnish press. In the same year, a highly controversial sexual abuse probe against Yury Dmitriyev was launched by authorities. The motivation behind this claim and the supposed new evidence were both challenged. In a lengthy and detailed investigation, Russian journalist Anna Yarovaya examined the evidence and interviewed historians and those who had found the site. She talked to Finnish historians of the Second World War; Irina Flige of the Memorial Society and Sergei Kashtanov, head of the district administration where the killing fields were found. She also interviewed Sergei Verigin, one of the Russian historians putting forward the new hypothesis. Russian newspapers and television had talked of \\"thousands\\" of POWs being shot by the Finns and buried at Sandarmokh: speaking on the record to Yarovaya, Verigin was more cautious and spoke of dozens and hundreds.Anna Yarovaya, \\"Rewriting Sandarmokh\\", The Russian Reader, 27 December 2017; original published by 7x7 - Horizontal Russia news website, 13 December 2017. The Karelian edition of the State-run Rossiya TV channel announced briefly on 22 April 2018 that there would be new investigations at Sandarmokh \\"this summer\\".\\"Disquieting News\\", Dmitriev Affair website, 3 May 2018. Agence France-Presse covered later developments in September 2018, citing critics who state that the digs have a political motivation to manipulate public opinion and an attempt to cover up Stalinist crimes. The European External Action Service's EUvsDisinfo.eu website has classified the claims that Finns are responsible for the Sandarmokh killings as \\"pro-Kremlin disinformation\\". The head of the local museum, Sergei Koltyrin, was arrested in October 2018, shortly after he publicly criticized the new excavations. He was convicted in a closed trial of pedophilia for 9 years in prison. In early March 2020, a local court decided to release him due to a fatal illness, however, the prosecutor challenged this decision and Koltyrin died in a prison hospital on 2 April 2020.

She spent some time with the West Africa Squadron suppressing the slave trade and later with the East Indies Station was involved in operations in Borneo. Iris was the first flagship of the Australia Station between 1859 and 1861 during which time she participated in the First Taranaki War.Bastock, p.27. In 1864 she was extensively modified to allow her to ferry transatlantic telegraph cable to the cable-laying ship Great Eastern. She was decommissioned and sold off in 1869.

On 28April 1841, her ship's boats were involved in burning the warehouses and other property of Niara Bely in Farenya, on the Pongo River. Iris was subsequently assigned to the East Indies Station. In 1844 she raced the French ships Sir√®ne, Sabine and Victorieuse at Singapore and beat them. In July 1846 Iris was part of an expedition along the Brune River in Borneo under Rear- Admiral Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald to destroy forts and batteries there. Her captain G. Rodney Mundy led a returning force of 476 men from six Royal Navy vessels along the Borneo River later that month. She was the flagship of the Australian Squadron between 1859 and 1860 under the command of Captain William Loring. She participated in the attack on Puketakauere, pƒÅ, during the First Taranaki War and left the Australia Station in 1861. 1862‚Äì1869 Together with HMS Amethyst, she was loaned by the Admiralty to the Atlantic Telegraph Company in 1864 and both ships were then extensively modified in 1865 for ferrying the Atlantic cable from the manufacturer's works at Enderby's Wharf, in East Greenwich, London, to the Great Eastern at her Sheerness mooring. The cable was coiled down into great cylindrical tanks at the wharf before being fed into the Great Eastern.

It lies along the eastern bank of Cibolo Creek, southwest of New Braunfels. The community is found in close proximity to Garden Ridge, and is included in the Greater San Antonio area. Geography Bracken is located at , above sea level. It is considered a part of the Texas Hill Country. Bracken Cave is found near the town and is notable for housing the largest collection of Mexican free-tailed bats in the world, numbering 20 million in habitation during spring migration. As a result, the cave also holds the record for the largest known concentration of mammals in the world. These bats have ventured to the cave for 10,000 years, helping the local agrarian economy by controlling the insect population. History William Bracken, for whom the town was named, purchased of land in the area in 1849 after receiving a grant from Governor Peter Hansborough Bell. Originally the town was known as Davenport, named for James G. Davenport, a landowner who settled in the area in 1868. The Davenport family cemetery still stands on the western bank of Cibolo Creek. To account for the growth of the city as construction began on the International and Great Northern Railroad, the establishment of a post office was requested in 1883. However, a Davenport Post Office already existed elsewhere in Texas, forcing the town to change its name to Bracken, after the early settler. Eventually, the town was given a post office. Following the completion of the railroad in 1890, a depot was built as well as a ticket stand. Soon, saloons lined the town's seven blocks, which expanded to thirteen near the turn of the century. Stores and other businesses including a blacksmith, cotton gin and lumberyard sprung up as well, contributing to the booming railroad economy. A dance hall, notorious for fights, was the center of entertainment until 1915, when a bowling alley was opened. After the passage of the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution implementing Prohibition, the town suffered a steep decline. Businesses left town and the general store burned to the ground. Prior to World War II, the Post Office was closed. In 1970, the town's population stood at 75, and remained the same for the next twenty years. In 2000, it had increased to 76 individuals. Education The residents of Bracken belong to the Comal Independent School District. Following World War II, Davenport School, which educated the town's children, was consolidated with schools in Solms and Danville to create Comal Elementary School.

They are usually hired for both men and women to assist in bathing and provide massage services. Etymology of male bathhouse attendant Various theories exist to explain the derivation of Sansuke. In Japanese, Sansuke originally meant three types of services: kamataki (stoking of the boiler), yukagen wo miru (checking the temperature of the bath water), and bandai (fee collection). It was an occasional duty for the Sansuke to provide the services of scrubbing and grooming the customer. This role took on greater prevalence, and the image of the Sansuke was generalized to mean service to the visitor in the bathhouse later on. Another theory suggests that when smallpox was rampant in Japan around the Nara era, the Empress Kohmyo built a bathhouse dedicated to the treatment of patients. It still exists today in the temple at Hokke-ji. Legend has it that she even sucked the pus from the boils herself. The attendants who helped the Empress during that time were called Sansuke (‰∏âÂÖ∏).ÊµúÈáéÂçì‰πü„ÄéÂÖâÊòéÁöáÂêé„Äè„Åï„Éª„Åà„Éª„ÇâÊõ∏Êàø„ÄÅ1981Âπ¥ During the Edo era, a , or was widely described as Sansuke as well.Â§ßËæûÊ≥â At work, Sansuke wears Sarumata (Japanese underwear); in earlier days, Sansuke wore Fundoshi (breech cloth).ÔΩ¢„Çπ„Éº„Éë„Éº„É¢„Éº„Éã„É≥„Ç∞2009Âπ¥6Êúà25Êó•ÊîæÈÄÅ Sansuke in premodern times Until the early Edo era, the services rendered by the Sansuke were provided by Yuna girls, who were attendants in the bathhouses called yunafuro. The Okami (the government) banned these bathhouses due to their growing reputation for sexual license and other forms of lax behavior. The hairstyles during this period were such that it was difficult to do one's hair without the help of an attendant. Hence, bathhouse male attendants started to offer the services previously provided by the yuna for a small fee. Sansuke was the highest class of male servants who served a master at the sento. To become a Sansuke, there were several precursor roles: collector of firewood, boiler man, and Yuban, checker of the bath temperature, and so on.‰∏≠ÈáéÊ†Ñ‰∏â„ÄéÂÖ•Êµ¥„ÉªÈä≠ÊπØ„ÅÆÊ≠¥Âè≤„ÄèÈõÑÂ±±Èñ£Âá∫Áâà„ÄÅ1984Âπ¥„ÄÅ175-178È†Å Yuban had the important work of checking the congestion degree of the bath or bathroom in addition to the previously cited tasks. It was, therefore, possible to become a Sansuke by gaining specific experiences. Later, based on historical accounts, the Sansuke also started providing sexual services. This development is attributed to the nature of the public bathhouses as a convenient site for discreet sexual encounters. Nagashi The service of washing off the dirt and brushing done by a Sansuke is called Nagashi. When announced by Bandai that there are customers, a Sansuke laves hot water into Oke and calls the customers in. In case there are many customers, the Sansuke must take care of the waiting list and wash the customers swiftly. The Sansuke offers service for both men and women; he may be required to work in crowds of naked women, whereby he must apply his mental training to prevent himself from having an erection.Ê∞∏ÂÖ≠Ëºî1971„ÄéÊ•µÈÅì„Åæ„Çì„Å†„Çâ„ÄèÊñáËä∏Êò•Áßã It is said that women were not ashamed to be seen by his eyes . When the washing service is complete he receives a tag from the customer, and his work was finished. His percentage of pay was based according to the number on the tag. The Sansuke belonged to a higher economic bracket in Sento and were considered to be gentlemen. Sansuke to avoid sexual services Until the Edo period, such spa massage services were provided by women (ÊπØÂ•≥Ôºåyuna), but gradually changed to sexual services, which were banned by politicians. In the Edo period Adultery with a married woman was a relatively serious crime. Consequently, with the prohibition of the yuna, men (Sansuke) came to play the role in their place. Sansuke during early-modern times Aka-suri, or massage, was called a Nagashi, and it reached the heights of popularity in the middle of the Showa era; during this time it was considered to be a luxury. Due to the subsequent proliferation of boilers and baths in general households, the need for Sansuke eventually waned and the service of Nagashi along with it.„Äê‰ªï‰∫ã‰∫∫„ÄëÊó•Êú¨„ÅßÂîØ‰∏Ä„ÅÆÈä≠ÊπØ„ÅÆÊµÅ„Åó„ÉªÊ©òÁßÄÈõ™„Åï„ÇìÔºà71Ôºâ Ê±üÊà∏„Å£Â≠ê„ÅÆËÉå‰∏≠Ë¶ã„Å§„ÇÅ„Å¶ ÔºàÁî£Áµå„Éã„É•„Éº„ÇπÔºâ--2009Âπ¥5Êúà31Êó• However, there are accounts that show the existence of Sansuke even during and after the American occupation of Japan. For instance, the Sansuke was referenced in the description of the communal Japanese bathhouse separated into two sections for male and female bathers. This attendant was identified as the only individual exempted from the gender segregation in the facility, providing services such as washing one's back and massage to both men and women. Sansuke today According to Shinobu Machida (Áî∫Áî∞Âøç), an expert and historian of sento, there is only one sansuke at Saitoh yu (ÊñâËó§ÊπØ) in Tokyo. His name is Mr. Shusei Tachibana (Ê©òÁßÄÈõ™). He gives service to both men and women in the public bath. However, he no longer engages in side works that ancient Sansukes offer such as the \\"fertility treatment\\". He is said to be offering Akasuri or massage treatment only.

He has been featured on several network television series, including Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and Going Off the Menu.  Early career  At the age of 16, following an internship promoting local night clubs, Fall launched his first venture, Mad City Entertainment, a Los Angeles artist management and event production company. In 2008, while attending Occidental College, Fall launched his second endeavor, Clich√© Magazine, a digital magazine focused on fashion and music. Fall credits the inspiration and success of the magazine to his extensive use of MySpace and Facebook during his event promotion days.  Career  In 2014, at the age of 24, Fall sprung into the hospitality scene with the opening of 3 bars. His first was Genesis, a pop-up bar and nightclub located in a vintage Hollywood attic. His second pop-up bar, Golden Box was inspired by the 1980s Manhattan night club scene and opened in the former LA Writers Room and in December 2014, Fall re-opened the former Skid-Row Los Angeles dive bar, King Eddy Saloon. In January 2016, Fall opened his first restaurant: late-night breakfast and cocktail establishment Nighthawk: Breakfast Bar in Venice, California. His inspiration for the concept was, \\"a melting pot of world cultures and flavors, mixed with my nostalgia for American diners.\\" Nighthawk is known for its lineup of original cocktails, including alcoholic cereal milk and it is included on Eater.com's list of \\"Hottest Bars from Coast to Coast\\" in North America.http://www.eater.com/maps/hottest-cocktail-bars-america- canada The restaurants success lead to the opening of a second location, Nighthawk: AM, a daytime takeout version of the themed restaurant in Chicago. Later that year, Fall collaborated with chef Alvin Cailan of Eggslut to open walk-up burger stand Easy's in Chinatown, LA. He also announced the acquisition and renovation of a Highland Park bodega, Tinfoil: Liquor & Grocery, and opened a \\"speakeasy\\" deli section in the back of the store.

Background Stanley was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He is of MƒÅori and Samoan Australian descent. He is younger brother of fellow professional Chase Stanley.  Early life  In his juniors, Stanley played for Hurstville United JRLFC, the same junior rugby league club that former Dragons players Anthony Mundine and Lance Thompson did.  Playing career = 2009  Stanley was part of the Dragons Under 20's team in the Toyota Cup throughout 2009 and 2010.  2010  Kyle made his debut in the NRL for the St. George Illawarra Dragons in round 11, 2010, at WIN Stadium Wollongong against the Canberra Raiders. He debuted at Fullback, and scored a try. He went on to play a total of 8 NRL games in 2010. On 6 September 2010, Stanley was selected in the Samoan train on squad.  2011  In January 2011, Stanley was named in the Daily Telegraphs '50 Rising Australian Sports Stars'. In an interview with the Illawarra Mercury published on 1 February 2011, Stanley said the following things about his desires and ambitions for the Dragons: \\"This is my club,\\" he said. \\"I've played my juniors here so I want to stay at the club. \\"This is my dream, playing for St George Illawarra, so hopefully I can keep it like that.\\" On 7 April 2011, it was confirmed that Stanley had resigned with the Dragons for a further 3 years which will see him stay at the club until at least the end of the 2014 season. In an interview after resigning, Stanley said: \\"As a local junior from the St George area growing up playing with Hurstville United, I‚Äôve always wanted to continue my career at the Dragons,\\" \\"My last two years under Wayne Bennett have been very beneficial and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing my development under Steve Price who will be the Head Coach of the Dragons from 2012.\\" On 27 April 2011, Stanley decided to reject the offer of pledging his allegiance to New Zealand and have the opportunity to represent the Kiwis, rather choosing to represent the country of his birth, Australia, in hope of playing both State Of Origin and for the Kangaroos. In June 2011, ahead of State Of Origin Game II, Stanley, along with 6 other 'Blues in waiting' ‚Äì Tariq Sims, Ryan James, Jamie Buhrer, Michael Oldfield, Jacob Loko & Josh Jackson, was in camp with the NSW Blues by invitation of coach Ricky Stuart, who was keen to have budding stars initiated in the new Origin culture he was trying to build.  2012  On 12 January 2012 Stanley was named in the 'NSW Blues in waiting squad'. A camp at Coogee coordinated by coach Ricky Stuart for players who he believes have potential to feature in future New South Wales Origin teams. Despite pledging his allegiance to Australia and New South Wales, it was reported on 15 May 2012, that Kyle had decided to represent New Zealand. When interviewed on his decision Kyle said ‚Äò‚ÄòI said last year that I wanted to play for Australia but things change and I want to play for New Zealand,‚Äô‚Äô Kyle said. ‚Äò‚ÄòAt the end of the day, it was a personal decision.‚Äô‚Äô He also said that the chance of being able to play alongside his brother Chase Stanley at the international level was also a reason in his decision ‚Äò‚ÄòChase is there and my family are from New Zealand,‚Äô‚Äô Kyle said. ‚Äò‚ÄòSo I chose New Zealand. It is exciting times.‚Äô‚Äô On 14 July 2012, during a game against the Cronulla Sharks at Wollongong Showground, Stanley ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. An injury that would end the 2012 season for him. It was reported on 27 November 2012, only 4 months after the injury he sustained to his knee, that Stanley had re-ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee after slipping on a wet surface away from training. \\"I was midway through my recovery, just at home and it started pouring down with rain,\\" Stanley said. \\"I went outside to bring some things inside off the patio, because they were getting wet. There was a heavy box and I sort of slipped on the tiles and hurt my bad (right) knee as I was carrying it inside.\\" At the time of the injury, his operating surgeon, Dr. Sorrenti said ‚Äò‚ÄòIf he has just ruptured his ligament and has no other damage then there is nothing to stop him from having a successful career‚Äô‚Äô  2013  Stanley spent the entire 2013 NRL season in physical rehabilitation. During an interview on 13 August 2013 ‚Äì Dragons high performance director Andrew Gray said ‚Äò‚ÄòKyle has just started running and he's looking fantastic‚Äô‚Äô. ‚Äò‚ÄòHe is looking great and will be ready to go at the start of next season‚Äô‚Äô. 2014 In Round 1 against the Wests Tigers at ANZ Stadium, Stanley played his first match for the Dragons since Round 19 2012, playing off the bench in the Dragons 44‚Äì24 win. Stanley finished off the Dragons 2014 season with him playing in 9 matches and scoring 1 try (4p). On 8 September 2014, Stanley was selected in the Samoa Four Nations train on squad. On 7 October 2014, Stanley was selected in the Samoa national rugby league team final 24-man squad for the 2014 Four Nations series. 2015 On 19 November 2014, Stanley signed a 1-year contract with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 2015 season. During the 2015 season, he tore his ACL a fifth time and required another knee reconstruction. On 2 October, he announced his retirement. He said it was at the recommendation of his surgeon as they had said they didn't feel Stanley's body was fit to play football again. Family Stanley is one of the famous 'Stanley' Rugby Clan which includes 'Smokin' Joe Stanley, Benson Stanley, Jeremy Stanley, Chase Stanley, Winston Stanley and Jamie Stanley. Kyle Stanley has two sons with his ex wife.

Bundled payments have been proposed in the health care reform debate in the United States as a strategy for reducing health care costs, especially during the Obama administration (2009‚Äì2016). Commercial payers have shown interest in bundled payments in order to reduce costs. In 2012, it was estimated that approximately one-third of the United States healthcare reimbursement used bundled methodology. Terminology Also known as episode-based payment, episode payment, episode-of-care payment, case rate, evidence-based case rate, global bundled payment, global payment, package pricing, or packaged pricing. History In the mid-1980s, it was believed that Medicare's hospital prospective payment system with diagnosis- related groups may have led to hospitals' discharging patients to post- hospital care (such as skilled nursing facilities) more quickly than was appropriate to save money. It was therefore suggested that Medicare bundle payments for hospital and posthospital care; however, despite favorable analyses of the idea, it had not been implemented, as of 2009. Bundled payments began as early as 1984, when The Texas Heart Institute, under the direction of Denton Cooley, began to charge flat fees for both hospital and physician services for cardiovascular surgeries. Authors from the Institute claimed that its approach \\"maintain[ed] a high quality of care\\" while lowering costs (in 1985, the flat fee for coronary artery bypass surgery at the Institute was $13,800 as opposed to the average Medicare payment of $24,588). Another early experience with bundled payments occurred between 1987 and 1989, involving an orthopedic surgeon, a hospital (Ingham Regional Medical Center), and a health maintenance organization (HMO) in Michigan. The HMO referred 111 patients to the surgeon for possible surgery; the surgeon would evaluate each patient for free. The surgeon and the hospital received a predetermined fee for any arthroscopic surgery performed, but they also provided a two-year warranty in that they promised to cover any post-surgery expenses (for example, four re-operations) instead of the HMO. Under this arrangement, \\"all parties benefitted financially\\": the HMO paid $193,000 instead of the $318,538 expected; the hospital received $96,500 instead of the $84,892 expected; and the surgeon and his associates received $96,500 instead of the $51,877 expected. In 1991, a \\"Medicare Participating Heart Bypass Center Demonstration\\" began in four hospitals across the United States; three other hospitals were added to the project in 1993, and the project concluded in 1996. In the demonstration, Medicare paid global inpatient hospital and physician rates for hospitalizations for coronary artery bypass surgery; the rates included any related readmissions. Among the published evaluations of the project were the following: * In a 1997 analysis, it was estimated that in 1991-1993, the original four hospitals would have had expenditures of $110.8 million for coronary artery bypasses for Medicare beneficiaries, but the change in reimbursement methodology saved $15.31 million for Medicare and $1.84 million for Medicare beneficiaries and their supplemental insurers, for a total savings of $17.2 million (15.5%). Of the total savings, 85%-93% was attributable to inpatient savings and another 6%-11% was attributable to postdischarge savings; furthermore, there was \\"no diminution in quality.\\" * A 1998 report to the Health Care Financing Administration (now known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) noted that in the five years of the demonstration project, the seven hospitals would have had expenditures of $438 million for coronary artery bypasses for Medicare beneficiaries, but the change in reimbursement methodology saved $42.3 million for Medicare and $7.9 million for Medicare beneficiaries and their supplemental insurers, for a total savings of $50.3 million (11.5%). In addition, controlling for patient risk factors, the inpatient mortality rate in the demonstration hospitals declined over the course of the project. The negative aspects of the project included difficulties in billing and collection. * A 2001 paper examining three of the original four hospitals with comparable \\"micro-cost\\" data determined that \\"the cost reductions primarily came from nursing intensive care unit, routine nursing, pharmacy, and catheter lab.\\" By 2001, \\"case rates for episodes of illness\\" (bundled payments) were recognized as one type of \\"blended payment method\\" (combining retrospective and prospective payment) along with \\"capitation with fee-for-service carve-outs\\" and \\"specialty budgets with fee-for-service or 'contact' capitation.\\" In subsequent years, other blended methods of payment have been proposed such as \\"comprehensive care payment\\", \\"comprehensive payment for comprehensive care\\", and \\"complete chronic care\\" which incorporate payment for keeping people as healthy as possible in addition to payment for episodes of illness. The St. Joseph Hospital in Denver held an acute-care episode (ACE) demonstration project in 2003, administered by Deirdre Baggot. Based on the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act, the ACE demonstration bundled Parts A and B of Medicare for episodes of care. In 2006-2007, the Geisinger Health System tested a \\"ProvenCare\\" model for coronary artery bypass surgery that included best practices, patient engagement, and \\"preoperative, inpatient, and postoperative care [rehospitalizations] within 90 days... packaged into a fixed price.\\" The program received national attention including articles in The New York Times and the New England Journal of Medicine in mid-2007. An evaluation published in late 2007 showed that 117 patients who received \\"ProvenCare\\" had a significantly shorter total length of stay (resulting in 5% lower hospital charges), a greater likelihood of being discharged to home, and a lower readmission rate compared with 137 patients who received conventional care in 2005. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave grants beginning in 2007 for a bundled payment project called PROMETHEUS (\\"Provider payment Reform for Outcomes, Margins, Evidence, Transparency, Hassle-reduction, Excellence, Understandability and Sustainability\\") Payment. With support of the Commonwealth Fund, the project developed \\"evidence-informed case rates\\" for various conditions that are adjusted for severity and complexity of a patient's illness. The \\"evidence-informed case rates\\" are used to set budgets for episodes of care. If actual quarterly spending by health care providers is under budget, the providers receive a bonus; if actual quarterly spending is over budget, payment to the providers is partially withheld. The model is currently being tested in three pilot sites which are scheduled to end in 2011. In mid-2008, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission made several recommendations along \\"a path to bundled payment.\\" For one, it recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human Services examine approaches such as \\"virtual bundling\\" (under which providers would receive separate payments, but could also be subject to rewards or penalties based on the levels of expenditures). In addition, it recommended that a pilot program be established \\"to test the feasibility of actual bundled payment for services around hospitalization episodes for select conditions.\\" Just before the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report was released, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a \\"Medicare Acute Care Episode (ACE) Demonstration\\" project for bundling payments for certain cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures. The bundling includes only hospital and physician charges, not post-discharge care; by 2009, five sites in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas had been selected for the project. In the project, hospitals give Medicare discounts of 1%-6% for the selected procedures, and Medicare beneficiaries receive a $250‚Äì$1,157 incentive to receive their procedures in the demonstration hospitals. Bundled payments for Medicare were a major feature of a November 2008 white paper by Senator Max Baucus, chair of the Senate Finance Committee. The white paper recommended that the Medicare ACE Demonstration \\"expand to other sites,\\" \\"focus on other clinical conditions if certain criteria are met,\\" and \\"include services that are provided post- hospitalization.\\" As of 2008, Geisinger's ProvenCare program had \\"attracted interest from Medicare officials and other top industry players\\" and had been expanded or was in the process of being expanded to hip replacement surgery, cataract surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, bariatric surgery, lower back surgery, and perinatal care. Interest in Geisinger's experience intensified in 2009 when newsmedia reports claimed that it was a model for health care reforms to be proposed by President Barack Obama and when Obama himself mentioned Geisinger in two speeches. In July 2009, a Special Commission on the Health Care Payment System in Massachusetts distinguished between episode-based payments (i.e., bundled payments) and \\"global payments\\" that were defined as \\"fixed-dollar payments for the care that patients may receive in a given time period... plac[ing] providers at financial risk for both the occurrence of medical conditions and the management of those conditions.\\" The Commission recommended that global payments \\"with adjustments to reward provision of accessible and high quality care\\" (not bundled payments) be used for Massachusetts health care providers. Among the reasons for selecting global payment were its potential to reduce episodes of care and previous experience with this payment method in Massachusetts. As of 2010, provisions for bundled payments are included in both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Affordable Health Care for America Act. The former bill establishes a national Medicare pilot program starting in 2013 with possible expansion in 2016,Bundled Payments ‚Äì Medicare Pilot Program. Health Reform GPS: a Joint Project of the George Washington University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. http://healthreformgps.org/resources/bundled- payments-%E2%80%93-medicare-pilot-program/ . which is consistent with the Obama proposal. The latter bill requires \\"a plan to reform Medicare payments for post-acute services, including bundled payments.\\" 450 healthcare organizations participated in the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative held by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The program tested the ability of bundling payments for services as a method for improving quality and lowering costs. In June 2016, CMS announced it would be extending the program for two more years. In July 2015, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced its proposal to mandate a 90-day bundled payment model as a new program for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing joint replacement called the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement initiative. The initiative is based on the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement program launched in 2011 and research from the Acute Care Episode demonstration project. The new program will improve cost efficiencies, patient outcomes, and collaboration among providers for an episode of care. Bundled payments will eliminate the demand for unnecessary testing and treatments. In July 2016, CMS announced three new bundles, referred to as episode payment models (EPMs) aimed at cardiovascular care procedures including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and hip/ femur fractures. The new model will go into effect on July 1, 2017. In January 2018, The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) introduced the successor to the BPCI program, BPCI Advanced, which is a voluntary episode payment model that will start on October 1, 2018 and run through December 31, 2023. According to CMS‚Äô FAQ on the program, ‚ÄúThere are two categories of Participants under BPCI Advanced: Convener Participants and Non-Convener Participants. A Convener Participant is a type of Participant that brings together multiple downstream entities referred to as ‚ÄúEpisode Initiators‚Äù‚Äîwhich must be either Acute Care Hospitals (ACHs) or Physician Group Practices (PGPs)‚Äîto participate in BPCI Advanced, facilitates coordination among them, and bears and apportions financial risks.‚Äù Advantages Advocates of bundled payments note: * 25 to 30 percent of hospital procedures are wasteful without improving the quality of care. Unlike fee-for-service, bundled payment discourages unnecessary care, encourages coordination across providers, and potentially improves quality. * Unlike capitation, bundled payment does not penalize providers for caring for sicker patients. * Considering the advantages and disadvantages of fee-for-service, pay for performance, bundled payment for episodes of care, and global payment such as capitation, Mechanic and Altman concluded that \\"episode payments are the most immediately viable approach.\\" * Researchers from the RAND Corporation estimated that \\"national health care spending could be reduced by 5.4% between 2010 and 2019\\" if the PROMETHEUS model for bundled payment for selected conditions and procedures were widely used. This figure was higher than for seven other possible methods of reducing national health expenditures. In addition, RAND found that bundled payments would decrease financial risk to consumers and would decrease waste. * Bundling payment provides additional advantages to providers and patients alike, through removing inefficiency and redundancy from patient-care protocols; e.g. duplicate testing, delivering unnecessary care, and failing to adequately provide postoperative care. * This method of payment can also provide transparency for consumers by fixing pricing and publishing cost and outcomes data. Patients would be able to choose a provider based on a comparison of real data, not word of mouth. * Bundled payments may also encourage economies of scale - especially if providers agree to use a single product or type of medical supply - as hospitals or integrated health systems can often negotiate better prices if they purchase supplies in bulk.\\"Bundled Payments: What Physicians Need to Know\\" Shelly K. Schwartz, Physicians Practice, November 2012. Considerations Before practices choose to participate in bundled payments, they need to be diligent in researching potential episodes of care that would be amenable to this type of reimbursement. Traditionally, physician‚Äôs quality monitoring and improvement is managed by the hospital‚Äôs nursing sector. Transitioning to a bundled payment methodology shifts accountability back to physicians, thus considerations for their delivery in an acute care episode is essential as well as realigning strategic nursing priorities to enable the needed capacity for care delivery transformation. Once they have selected and defined an episode of care, they should: * Identify all associated costs * List all services provided within the episode of care * Calculate how the care episode would be reimbursed * Identify how many entities would share in reimbursement\\"Taming Payment and Delivery Model Monsters\\" Sheri Porter, AAFP News, September 2012. * Involve physicians in care coordination * Create care delivery models to reduce waste, minimize redundancy, and improve provider communication * Identify the advantages of investing in home care options According to a February 2018 Health Affairs article, Government As Innovation Catalyst: Lessons From The Early Center For Medicare And Medicaid Innovation Models, ‚ÄúThe [BPCI] initiative also highlighted business and operational barriers to implementing this approach. These included managing cash flows, developing budgets for episodes paid prospectively (rather than retrospectively), and reliably tracking providers‚Äô enrollment in a bundled payment model. Convening organizations (such as Premier or Remedy Partners, which brought multiple providers together to support implementation and sometimes shouldered some financial risk), could bring bundles to scale faster but introduced the additional complexity of a three-way arrangement among payer, convener, and provider.‚Äù In Case study: Delivery and payment reform in congestive heart failure at two large academic centers, published in the July 2014 edition of Healthcare: The Journal of Delivery Science and Innovation, the authors state, ‚ÄúConvening organizations play a key role in providing technical assistance and implementation support. Clinical leaders and health systems do not always have a complete set of tools for payment reform. Thus, conveners contracted by CMMI, played a helpful role in catalyzing payment reform for their members.‚Äù  Design options  Implementation of bundled payments can take many different forms. Several of the key design dimensions include: * Prospective vs. retrospective payment: A prospective bundle pays a fixed price, established in advance, to a provider to deliver all services included within the bundle. A retrospective bundle initially pays each provider for services in the traditional fee-for-service payment method; after the completion of the episode of care, a provider designated as the accountable provider for the bundle receives a share of savings relative to the bundle price or pays a share of costs in excess of the bundle price. Retrospective payment is sometimes called \\"virtual bundling.\\" * Approach to risk adjustment: bundled payments often use a risk adjustment approach to modify the price of the bundle to reflect the severity of the patient's condition. Payment methods vary on the basis of which factors are used to determine the risk adjustment (such a patient diagnoses from the past year, patient diagnoses from the past three years, patient medications) and how much each factor adjusts the price of the bundle. * Level of risk sharing: a bundled payment may be structured to offer upside (a share of savings if costs are below the bundle price), downside (a share of excess costs if costs are above the bundle price), or both. Providers may bear all of the savings and/or excess costs (100% risk), or they may bear a fraction of the risk while payers continue to bear the rest. * Exclusions, tail risk, and stop-loss criteria: Bundled payment models may choose to set up a variety of safeguards that limit the financial risk that providers bear under extreme circumstances. Various forms of these safeguards include criteria excluding certain types of cases (such as patients with serious comorbidities), criteria excluding costs for cases in excess of a cost threshold (such as unusual cases whose cost is more than 3 standard deviations above the average), and stop-loss criteria limiting the downside that a provider will bear if the average cost is far above the bundle price. Disadvantages The drawbacks of a bundled payment approach include: * The scientific evidence in support of it has been described as \\"scant.\\" For example, RAND concluded that its effect on health outcomes is \\"uncertain.\\" * It does not discourage unnecessary episodes of care; for example, physicians might hospitalize some patients unnecessarily. * Providers may seek to maximize profit by avoiding patients for whom reimbursement may be inadequate (e.g., patients who do not take their drugs as prescribed), by overstating the severity of an illness, by giving the lowest level of service possible, by not diagnosing complications of a treatment before the end date of the bundled payment, or by delaying post-hospital care until after the end date of the bundled payment. * Hospitals may seek to maximize profit by limiting access to specialists during an inpatient stay. * Because one provider may outsource part of the care of a patient to other providers, it may be difficult to assign financial accountability for a given bundled payment. * There is an administrative and operational burden, for example in establishing fair compensation rates. Small sample sizes and incomplete data may cause difficulties in calculation of proper rates for bundled payments. If rates are set too high, providers may provide unnecessary services; if rates are set too low, providers may experience financial difficulties or may provide inadequate care. * Some types of illnesses may not fall neatly into \\"episodes.\\" * It is possible that one patient may have multiple bundles that overlap each other. * Academic health centers, which emphasize research, teaching, and new technologies, may be disadvantaged by the payment scheme. * Providers risk large losses, for example if a patient experiences a catastrophic event. A complex \\"reinsurance mechanism\\" may be needed to convince providers to accept bundled payments. * A study by Dartmouth Medical School showed extreme variation in healthcare across the U.S. and attributed the inconstancies to a lack of standardized care protocols. Currently, there is no nationally accepted bundled payment methodology defined, though continued experimentation is expected to lead to refinement.

The series consists of a first season of 22 episodes which ran from March 19, 2009 until September 11, 2009, a second season of 20 episodes which premiered on January 28, 2010, as well as two derivative series that run concurrently with the second season, and concluded on June 4, 2010. The series is well received, and is the first non-variety sketch show on the site to make it past a first season. The show, like many on the site, took fan submissions and integrated them into each episode. Plot The show is a parody of the fandom that surrounds popular vampire franchises like Twilight. Season One Corbin and Luci, two best friends, run \\"I <3 Vampires\\" - a fansite for their favorite book, Confessions of a High School Vampire, for which Corbin makes daily vlogs regarding the book series. When Luci receives an anonymous e-mail containing the first six chapters of the upcoming book in the Confessions series (derived from the online leak of part of the fifth Twilight book, Midnight Sun), the best friends are so excited that Corbin posts the chapters on \\"I <3 Vampires\\" without thinking about the consequences. When the books' author, Siona McCabre, learns that chapters of her new book have been leaked, and announces that she has halted the publication of the book indefinitely, Corbin and Luci take it upon themselves to find Siona and apologize, hoping that Siona will continue with the book's publication. With the help of Corbin's annoying neighbour, Wyatt, the three go on a quest to find Siona, which proves to be more difficult - and much more complicated - than they had originally thought. Season Two A year ago, Corbin and Luci found out that their favorite book, Confessions of a High School Vampire, was more real than they ever could have imagined. Now the two are no longer friends, and have abandoned \\"I <3 Vampires,\\" the fansite they created for Confessions. They have also broken up with their supernatural boyfriends, Nick and Wyatt, and so Corbin is surprised when Siona McCabre, author of Confessions and mother to Corbin's ex-boyfriend Nick, asks Corbin to help her find Nick, who has been missing for several weeks. Corbin refuses. Three days later, Corbin learns that Siona has been killed, and so she makes her first vlog since abandoning \\"I <3 Vampires,\\" in which she apologizes for leaving the fansite without an explanation. Corbin then goes missing, and it's up to her college roommate, Confessions fan Sam, to reunite Luci and Wyatt so that the three of them can find Corbin together. Hiatus and Series Future At the conclusion of the second season there was not any news on whether or not there would be a third season. Cherilyn Wilson and Alli Kinzel later stated in a YouTube video that there would not be another season coming in the foreseeable future as they have not been contacted about continuing the series, despite high fan demand. On June 15, Josh Nuncio announced on Twitter that both seasons with cast commentary and alternate endings would be available on Amazon.com. Book In 2011 Disney Publishing Worldwide published I Heart Vampires: Birth (A Confessions of a High School Vampire Novel) which was written by Siona McCabre. It is the same book that Corbin and Luci read in the series. The book is about the student Noah Vance who discovers two bite marks in a morning after a high school party. He realizes that he is turning into a vampire.

It circulated in the Dakotas and other states, Canada, and Europe, from 1874 to 1954. The newspaper was non-denominational and neutral in politics. The focus of the paper was on Germans from Russia; German settlers in Russian colonies around the Black Sea and, to a lesser degree, along the Volga River; and subsequent settlers in the Dakotas in the United States. The Dakota Freie Presse was published first only in German, but it later began publishing in English. In 1920, the Der Auslanddeutsche 8 reported that \\"The Dakota Freie Presse was the recognized organ of the Russian-Germans in America and perhaps in the whole world. As such, it offered largely the private correspondence of its readers. Although these write-ups were superficial and rather insignificant as far as content is concerned, below the surface they had great importance because the identity and cohesion of the ethnic Germans who emigrated from Russia was thereby maintained for nearly fifty years.\\"Der Auslanddeutsche 8, a bimonthly publication of the Institut f√ºr Auslandsbeziehungen (founded in 1917 and known until 1945 as the Deutsches Ausland-Institut) in Stuttgart, Germany, stated in 1920:  History  The Dakota Freie Presse was founded in April 1874 by Bernhard Quinke. Johann Christian Wenzlaff took the paper over in 1885 or 1886 and acquired a building lot on Broadway, erecting a brick building to house the printing establishment and editorial room. From its new base of operations in New Ulm, the DFP, following the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, operated its own relief program for the hungry children of Germany. Editor F. W. Sallet personally sought funds and materials which he shipped to Osterode, East Prussia, where the entire program was administered by the editor's older brother, Daniel Gottfried Sallet, the father of Dr. Richard Sallet who would one day succeed F. W. Sallet in the editor's chair. Schmidt was listed in the editorial block of the DFP only until September 16, 1942. From March 11 to September 16, 1942, the names of L. Luedtke, A. Hochscheid, and Frau Grete (obviously a pen name) resided in Milwaukee and was responsible for the section, F√ºr Hausfrau, Gattin, und Mutter (for the housekeeper, wife, and mother). After September 16, 1942, only John Brendel was consistently associated with the editorship in Bismarck until Joseph Gaeckle came into the picture for the first time on August 4, 1948. The Dakota Freie Presse went out of print on February 24, 1954.  Circulation  Initially, it had a very low and only local circulation (295 copies in 1875, 1,200 in 1880, 2,170 in 1890, and 3,400 in 1900), and not until after F. W. Sallet arrived did the paper take on its transregional nature and obtained a skyrocketing circulation (7,500 in 1905, 9,500 in 1910, and nearly 14,000 by 1920). In 1924, the DFP became the first paper published in the United States to be allowed re-entry into the Soviet Union. The DFP merged with the Dakota Rundschau in late 1932 or early 1933. However, the Rundschau itself derived from three previous mergers. These mergers were the Eureka Rundschau, a Black Sea German paper owned and published by Gustav Mauser and Otto H. Froh, which was located in Eureka, South Dakota and which began publishing on June 3, 1915; the Bismarck Nordlicht, which began publishing on February 1, 1885; and the Mandan Volkszeitung. When the DFP disappeared as a visible organ in 1954, it did not entirely cease publication because it was consolidated with the America Herold Zeitung.

Awarded establishments comply with strict criteria, independently verified through regular on-site audits. It aims to contribute to the prevention of climate change by awarding and advocating facilities with positive environmental initiatives. Green Key is a non-governmental, non- profit, independent programme operating under the umbrella organisation of the Foundation for Environmental Education, FEE. The programme is recognised and supported by the World Tourism Organization, WTO and United Nations Environmental Programme, UNEP. Green Key has an international programme administration at the FEE Head Office in Copenhagen and Green Key National Operators in most member countries implementing the programme on national levels. Green Key is one of the largest eco-labels for the hospitality industry worldwide and currently has more than 3,200 awarded hotels and other establishments in 65 countries.  Aims  Green Key aims to * Increase the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable methods of operation and technology in the establishments and thereby reduce the overall use of resources. * Raise awareness and create behavioural changes in guests, staff and suppliers of individual tourism establishments. * Increase the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable methods and raise awareness to create behavioural changes in the hospitality and tourism industry overall.  History  Green Key International began in Denmark in 1994 and was adopted by the Foundation for Environmental Education in 2002 to become its fifth international partner. It has since spread to nearly 65 countries and continues to grow in number and reach across the world. Commercial websites, such as Bookdifferent.com, is partnering with Green Key to entice travelers to book eco friendly hotels.  Criteria  Tourism facilities awarded a Green Key adhere to national or international Green Key criteria. The criteria have been designed to be easily understood by travellers, feasible for the tourism industry, and clearly verifiable through control checks. International criteria reflect the various fields of tourism facilities (hotels, hostels, camp sites, conference and holiday centres, tourist attractions and restaurants) and specialized national criteria reflect each country‚Äôs legislation, infrastructure and culture. The criteria focus on environmental management, technical demands and initiatives for the involvement of guests, staff and suppliers. Some of the categories covered are: Water, Waste, Energy, Involvement and Awareness of Guests, Environmental Management, Staff Involvement, Use of Chemicals, Open Spaces, and Food and Beverages.  Five pillars  The Green Key programme rests on five pillars: * Education of staff, clients and owners towards increased sustainable development and environmental awareness in leisure establishments; * Environmental preservation by the reduction of the environmental impact of each establishment in the world scene; * Economical management by the reduction of consumption meaning a reduction of costs; * Marketing strategy by the promotion of the Green Key label and the establishments using the Green Key icon; * Strengthening of the tourism and leisure branch by taking responsibility broader than then their individual establishments.  Global Forest Fund  The Foundation for Environmental Education, which runs the Green Key Programme, uses a tool to compensate their CO2 emissions from flight travels. The funds are distributed by the programme Learning about Forests (LEAF), which involves children in planting tree activities.

He was already interested in the Communist Party and the information he learned from his personal contact with G√∂ring filled him with hate for the Nazis and only pushed him further toward the idea of resistance.

They tried to strengthen the domestic German resistance through contacts with the resistance groups of the foreign forced laborers. It was an international organization organized as a network of smaller groups of individual resistance fighters. They weren't trying to bring down the Nazi regime themselves, which they expected to collapse of its own, rather they worked to create a political structure that could step in, which would be necessary when the Hitler-regime finally fell apart. In the meantime, the group produced anti-Nazi leaflets and hid Jews and others hunted by the Nazi regime and supplied them with new identification papers, food and information.Claudia Keller. \\"Sp√§te Ehre f√ºr die selbstlosen Retter\\" (\\"Late Honor for the selfless Lifesaver\\") Der Taggespiel (July 6, 2005) Retrieved March 16, 2010 Many members were already hiding Jews before 1939, feeding and taking care of them and saving them from deportation to concentration camps. Starting in 1942, they also helped foreign forced laborers. In addition, they stayed in contact with several other groups and individuals, through the various contacts of the core members of the group. The EU eventually numbered about 50 people and included many forced laborers from Ukraine, Czechoslovakia and France, making it an international group with a larger perimeter than the Gestapo investigations reveal. This is underscored by the fact that even as the EU was brought down by the wave of arrests, Konstantin ≈Ωadkeviƒç was able to keep working with the forced laborers for another month.

Arrest and punishment  The EU was stopped by the Gestapo, not for its activities, but because one of the leading members of the EU, Paul Hatschek had been under heavy surveillance for years.Werner Theuer and Bernd Florath, Robert Havemann Bibliographie: mit unver√∂ffentlichten Texten aus dem Nachlass Robert Havemann Gesellschaft. Akademie Verlag (2007), p. 271\\\\. Retrieved August 15, 2011 In 1943, the Gestapo observed Hatschek meeting two parachute landings. After they had enough information from their investigations, they arrested Hatschek on September 3, 1943, subjecting him to intensive interrogation that same day. Two days later, the Gestapo arrested every single person Hatschek had named, big and small. After weeks of interrogation, sometimes brutal, they arrested the core group of the forced laborers working with ≈Ωadkeviƒç. By the end, they had over 40 members of the EU; the number of forced laborers arrested, but not brought before a court, is unknown. The Jews being hidden by the EU were sent to Auschwitz, where about half of them were killed. There were more than 12 trials before the People's Court. Of those, 15 were sentenced to death and 13 were executed. Two died while being interrogated. Havemann survived because his execution kept being postponed, due to intervention from the biochemists he had earlier worked with. His execution was postponed often enough that he was eventually freed by the Red Army. Groscurth, Herbert Richter (also known as Richter-Luckian) and Rentsch were executed at Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison on May 8, 1944. Other group members were indicted before other courts.

These lesion usually on the lower extremities and may be extensive They are frequently painful. Rarely it may be fatal.  Pathology  The main pathological features of this disease are a vasculitis affecting all cutaneous vessels. There are by five characteristic features: * colonisation of endothelial cells by acid-fast bacilli * endothelial proliferation and marked thickening of vessel walls to the point of obliteration * angiogenesis * vascular ectasia * thrombosis of the superficial and mid-dermal blood vessels The likely pathogenesis is endothelial cell injury due to colonization/invasion followed by proliferation, angiogensis, thrombosis and vessel ectasia. Treatment Lucio's phenomenon is treated by anti-leprosy therapy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine), optimal wound care, and treatment for bacteremia including antibiotics.

One of the areas where Khmer Rouge insurgents hid at the time of the PRK/SOC. The K5 Plan (), K5 Belt or K5 Project, also known as the Bamboo Curtain,Kelvin Rowley, Second Life, Second Death: The Khmer Rouge After 1978, Swinburne University of Technology was an attempt between 1985 and 1989 by the government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea to seal Khmer Rouge guerrilla infiltration routes into Cambodia by means of trenches, wire fences, and minefields along virtually the entire Thai‚ÄìCambodian border.Margaret Slocomb, The People's Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The revolution after Pol Pot Background Border camps hostile to the PRK; 1979-1984 After the defeat of Democratic Kampuchea in 1979, the Khmer Rouge fled Cambodia quickly. Protected by the Thai state, and with powerful foreign connections, Pol Pot's virtually intact militia of about 30,000 to 35,000 troops regrouped and reorganized in forested and mountainous zones behind the Thai-Cambodian border. During the early 1980s Khmer Rouge forces showed their strength in Thailand, inside the refugee camps near the border, and were able to receive a steady and abundant supply of military equipment. The weapons came mainly from China and the US and were channeled across Thailand with the cooperation of the Royal Thai Armed Forces.Puangthong Rungswasdisab, Thailand's Response to the Cambodian Genocide From their position of security in hidden military outposts along the Thai border, the Khmer Rouge militias launched a relentless military campaign against the newly established People's Republic of Kampuchea state. Even though the Khmer Rouge was dominant, it fought against the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces (KPRAF) and Vietnam People's Army along with minor non-communist armed factions which had formerly been fighting against the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. The border war followed a wet season / dry season rhythm. Generally, the heavily armed Vietnamese forces conducted offensive operations during the dry seasons, and the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge held the initiative during the rainy seasons. In 1982, Vietnam launched a largely unsuccessful offensive against the main Khmer Rouge base at Phnom Malai in the Cardamom Mountains. The major consequence of the border civil war was that the PRK was hampered in its efforts to rebuild the much-damaged nation and consolidate its administration. The new republic's rule was tenuous in the border areas owing to persistent sabotage by the Khmer Rouge of the provincial administrative system through constant guerrilla warfare. Implementation The architect of the K5 plan was Vietnamese general L√™ ƒê·ª©c Anh, commander of the PAVN forces in Cambodia. He formulated five key points for the defence of Cambodia against Khmer Rouge re-infiltration. Letter \\"K\\", the first letter of the Khmer alphabet, came from kar karpier, meaning 'defence' in the Khmer language, and number \\"5\\" referred to Le Duc Anh's five points in his plan of defence, of which the sealing of the border with Thailand was the second point. Many workers on the project, however, did not know what \\"K5\\" stood for.Esmeralda Luciolli, Le mur de bambou, ou le Cambodge apr√®s Pol Pot. The K5 Plan began on 19 July 1984.Chronologie du Cambodge de 1960 √† 1990 - from Raoul M. Jennar, Les cl√©s du Cambodge It became a gigantic effort that included clearing long patches of tropical forest by felling a great number of trees, as well as slashing and uprooting tall vegetation. The purpose was to leave a continuous broad open space all along the Thai border that would be watched and mined. In practice the K5 fence consisted of a roughly 700 km-long, 500 m-wide swath of land along the border with Thailand, where antitank and antipersonnel mines were buried to a density of about 3,000 mines per kilometre of frontage.Landmine Monitor Report 2005 Consequences From the environmental viewpoint the massive felling of trees was an ecological disaster, contributing to acute deforestation, the endangerment of species, and leaving behind a vast degraded area. The more remote places, like the Cardamom Mountains had been relatively untouched by man until they became a stronghold of the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. Presently these mountains are an endangered ecoregion. Unforeseen by the planners of the project, from the military point of view the K5 Plan was also disastrous for the PRK. It did not deter the Khmer Rouge fighters who found ways to cross it, for it was impossible to effectively police the long border. Besides, maintenance was difficult, as the razed jungle left a scruffy undergrowth that, in the tropical climate, would grow again yearly to about a man's height.Soizick Crochet, Le Cambodge, Karthala, Paris 1997, The K5 Plan was counterproductive for the image of the PRK, as a republic bent on reconstructing what the rule of Pol Pot and his Communist Party of Kampuchea had destroyed in Cambodia. Despite the magnitude of the effort, the whole project was ultimately unsuccessful and ended up playing into the hands of the enemies of the new pro-Hanoi republic. Thousands of Cambodian peasants, who despite the Vietnamese invasion had welcomed their release from the Khmer Rouge's interference in traditional farming and the absence of taxes under the PRK government, became disgruntled. They were angry at having to abandon their farms in order to dedicate time to clear the jungle, heavy toil they perceived as useless and unfruitful. Their resentment grew in time as they perceived the forced labor to be, albeit without the killings, very similar to what they had experienced under the Khmer Rouge.Margaret Slocomb, \\"The K5 Gamble: National Defence and Nation Building under the People's Republic of Kampuchea\\", Journal of Southeast Asian Studies (2001), 32 : 195-210 Cambridge University Press Owing to unsanitary conditions and the abundance of mosquitoes in areas of difficult access, badly fed and badly lodged workers on the K5 project fell victim to malaria and exhaustion.Craig Etcheson, After the killing fields: lessons from the Cambodian genocide, Many of the mines remain to this day, making the vast area dangerous. The K5 zone became part of the great landmine problem in Cambodia after the end of the civil war. In 1990 alone, the number of Cambodians that had a leg or foot amputated as a result of an injury caused by a land mine reached around 6,000.NewScientist - \\"The killing minefields of Cambodia\\" See also *People's Republic of Kampuchea *Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces *Vietnamese border raids in Thailand ReferencesFurther reading *Evan Gottesmann, Cambodia After the Khmer Rouge: Inside the Politics of Nation Building, External links *Comment on Esmeralda Luciolli, Le mur de bambou, ou le Cambodge apr√®s Pol Pot. *Sok Udom Deth, The Geopolitics of Cambodia During the Cold War Period, Ohio University Category:People's Republic of Kampuchea Category:Fortification lines Category:Deforestation Category:Minefields Category:Environmental disasters in Asia Category:Cambodia‚ÄìThailand border Category:Hun Sen ","title":"K5 Plan"},{"id":"26574425","text":"Amy Fab√© Dia Longo (born 14 February 1977 in Creil, France) is a French- Italian sprint athlete who specializes in the 200 metres.

Lewis Publishers, Limited, Leigh-on-Sea  Early life  Born on 13 March 1904 to a working-class family in Fulham, he was the youngest of five children. Two of his brothers died in the Middle East towards the end of the First World War which seems to have had a profound effect on his outlook and beliefs. He left school at 14, and at about that time won an art competition in a national newspaper with a watercolour drawing of an aircraft; on the strength of this he obtained his first job in an advertising studios in the Strand. He learned many aspects of commercial art there, and eventually set up a studio in Holborn with two artist friends, where all three worked on illustration and children's comics.  Career  With the Second World War looming he decided to volunteer for the navy before conscription started, and had spent only a few months in the Naval Patrol Service before his skills were recognised and he was seconded to the Naval Camouflage unit at Leamington Spa, where he spent the rest of the war making model ships and testing camouflage designs. After the war he went back to his studio, but found it difficult to find illustration work, however by then he had begun to sell his oil paintings and to build a reputation as a marine artist, being elected a member of the Royal Society of Marine Artists in 1947. Then in 1953 he received a commission from the Master of Trinity House to paint the triumphal return of the Queen from the Commonwealth Tour, with the Royal Yacht Britannia passing under Tower Bridge in London; this painting was presented to Her Majesty in 1954 and it subsequently hung over the fireplace in the drawing-room of the Royal Yacht until the ship was decommissioned; the work now hangs in Frogmore House at Windsor. From this point his work began to receive worldwide recognition. He did several paintings for Aristotle Onassis, for the Union-Castle Line and Clan Line. His large work 'Jeannette, Trafalgar 1805' (shown above) which was painted for the RSMA Jubilee Exhibition at Guildhall, London was purchased by Mr Garfield Weston, and now hangs in Fortnum and Mason's store, Piccadilly. His large work 'The Mayflower and Speedwell at Dartmouth' was bought by the Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Another large painting, 'HRH Price of Wales Leaving Plymouth, 1861' was commissioned by Mr Stuart Liberty, and now hands in Liberty (department store) in London. Two of his works hang in King's House, Jamaica, and countless others works in Italy, USA, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, etc. in addition to several in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. He was for many years an active member of the Wapping Group of Artists, who met regularly and exhibited yearly at the Mall Galleries; other members included Jack Merriott, Max Hofler, Hugh Boycott Brown and David Ghilchik. = Personal life = He married Alice \\"Peta\\" Spurgeon, who was herself a painter and commercial artist, in 1939, and they had three sons, John, William and Ingram. In 1963 they moved out of London to live at Rustington in Sussex, where he built a large studio to continue his painting. It was also here that he worked on writing and illustrating his two books: Mr Pepys's Navy and Ansons Voyage. He died in Rustington in January 1982.

It was an independent body which had a mandate to supervise and regulate the non-bank financial services industry in the public interest. This included the regulation of the biggest stock exchange in Africa the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. From 1 April 2018 the FSB was split into prudential and market conduct regulators. History The FSB was established in 1991 based on recommendations by the Van der Horst CommitteeStrategic Plan 08 to create an independent body to supervise and regulate the non-banking financial services industry. A number of additional acts later expanded and increased the role of the FSB. These included; In September 2004, the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act (FAIS) expanded the mandate of the FSB to include aspects of market conduct in the banking industry. Financial Intelligence Centre Act (2001) and subsequent amendments have added responsibilities to the FSB to combat money laundering. Responsibilities and functions The FSB's stated vision was \\"to promote and maintain a sound financial investment environment in South Africa\\"Welcome to the FSB It was responsible for all non-bank financial intermediaries, which included; * Capital Markets * Collective Investment Schemes * Financial Services Providers * Insurers * Re-insurers, short and long-term * Lloyd's correspondents * Other credit agents * Nominee companies * Retirement funds * Friendly Societies * Funerals It was given responsibility for ensuring that the regulated entities complied with the relevant legislation as well as capital adequacy requirements to promote financial soundness of these entities, whereby the investing community would be protected. It was given enforcement powers to deal with breaches through the enforcement committee. The Committee could impose unlimited penalties, compensation orders and cost orders. Such orders were enforceable on the same basis as a judgment of the Supreme Court of South Africa. It also ran a customer complaints service and a separate appeals board could be approached by anybody aggrieved by a decision of the FSB or its executive officers. The appeals board was an independent tribunal, whose members were neither employees of the FSB nor active participants in the financial services industry. Its chairman and the members were appointed by the Minister of Finance. International FSB was a member of International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and is a signatory of the IOSCO multilateral MoUs. The FSB participated in the activities of African regulatory bodies, particularly those in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. It had long standing close relations with Committee Of Insurance, Securities And Non-Banking Financial Authorities (CISNA), part of the SADC directorate.  Structure  The FSB's board oversaw its operations through various committees. The board also appointed the FSB executive officer who presided over the day-to-day running of the FSB. Besides those committees, the FSB also provided funding for the ‚ÄòOffice of the FAIS Ombud‚Äô and the ‚ÄòOffice of the PFA‚Äô on the basis of approved budgets. The Offices were part of the same regulatory framework within which the FSB operated, but functioned independently of the FSB, as their sole mandate was to dispose of complaints lodged by consumers of financial services in terms of their respective Acts. The Executive Officer was also the Registrar of Non-banking Financial Institutions. There were four Deputy Executive Officers responsible for supervision of the various industries, namely Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services, Retirement Funds and Friendly Societies, and Insurance and Investment Institutions. Failures and mismanagement The FSB was unable to prevent a number of significant scandals and disasters in South Africa's pension funds industry. It was also accused of favouritism and overcharging for legal and administrative services. Some of its interactions with financial service providers have been described as harsh and bizarre, which led to criticism from the press as well as the financial services industry. In a report released in March 2019, the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, castigated the FSB's officials for a variety of failures spanning more than a decade. The FSCA, successor to the FSB, countered however that the report was \\"riddled with inaccuracies\\". Reorganization into Prudential Authority and Financial Sector Conduct Authority On 21 August 2017 the Financial Sector Regulation Act (FSR Act) was signed into law. Among other changes. the FSR Act created a prudential regulator, the Prudential Authority (PA) and a market conduct regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). * The PA is responsible for regulating banks, insurers, cooperative financial institutions, financial conglomerates and certain market infrastructures. * FSCA was given the mandate of market conduct regulator of financial institutions that provide financial products and financial services, and financial institutions that are licensed in terms of a financial sector law, including banks, insurers, retirement funds and administrators, and market infrastructures. On April 1, 2018, the PA assumed the FSB's responsibilities for non bank financial institution prudential supervision and the FSB's responsibilities for market conduct were assumed by FSCA See also *Economy of South Africa *South African Reserve Bank *Financial Sector Conduct Authority *Prudential Authority *Securities Commission  References  External links  *Official site South Africa Category:Finance in South Africa Category:Government agencies of South Africa ","title":"Financial Services Board (South Africa)"},{"id":"26574560","text":"Goriƒça Vas (; , Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

He took office at the end of the great persecution of Shapur II. Like several other early bishops of Seleucia- Ctesiphon, he is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East.  Sources  Brief accounts of Tomarsa's episcopate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century),  øAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). His life is also covered in the Chronicle of Seert. In all these accounts he is anachronistically called 'catholicus', a term that was only applied to the primates of the Church of the East in the fifth century. Modern assessments of his reign can be found in Wigram's Introduction to the History of the Assyrian Church and David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Wigram, Assyrian Church, 83‚Äì84; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 17‚Äì18  Tomarsa's episcopate  The following account of Tomarsa's episcopate and martyrdom is given by Bar Hebraeus: > After Barb øashmin, Tamuza.

Along with the Tribune Tower and Wrigley Building, it forms the southern gateway to Chicago's famous Magnificent Mile. The building was built atop the site of a cabin belonging to Chicago's first permanent resident, Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable. In reference to du Sable, the large plaza adjacent to the building has been named Pioneer Court.  History  401 North Michigan occupies a site with several aspects of historical significance, both on a local and national scale. The site was originally settled by du Sable around 1779, and operated as a personal residence and fur- trading post, forming the very beginnings of the city of Chicago. In 1803, Fort Dearborn was built by the United States government immediately across the river, helping to protect the growing trading post from local Native American tribes. One year later in 1804, John Kinzie bought du Sable's property and occupied it until his death in 1828. In 1849, Cyrus McCormick moved to Chicago to set up a factory for his invention, the horse-drawn reaper, and purchased several lots on the former du Sable/Kinzie property, eventually developing a large factory complex. After this factory burned in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, McCormick moved his factory to the West Side. Even as Michigan Avenue was slowly rebuilt into the city's premier street beginning in the 1920s, the site remained industrial in usage, and by 1961, it had become a parking lot. In 1961, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States announced its intention to construct a new, modern office tower at the 401 North Michigan site, relocating its sizable Chicago offices from cramped space at 29 South LaSalle Street. The announcement described the proposed 800,000 ft¬≤ tower as a \\"glittering structure of metal, marble, and glass set amid a picturesque plaza\\". Construction began in 1963 and commenced in 1965. In addition to Equitable, one of the largest tenants of the building - occupying 12 floors - was the International Harvester Company (now Navistar International Corporation), the descendant of Cyrus McCormick's original reaper works, which intended to \\"return to its birthplace\\".  Architecture  The box-shaped building, designed by Bruce Graham and Natalie de Blois of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, was designed in the International Style with large columns and spandrel beams expressed on each facade and covered in anodized aluminum, complemented by large windows on all four sides of the building. As in many office towers, a core containing stairs, elevators, and bathrooms lies at the center. At the urging of the Chicago Tribune, Graham designed the building with a 175-foot (53m) setback from Michigan Avenue, to avoid blocking views of the Chicago River from the Tribune's nearby building. A large plaza created by this setback was named Pioneer Court, envisioned by both Equitable and the Tribune as a monumental civic space in Chicago honoring various civic founders, including du Sable and Kinzie. The plaza is at the elevated level of Michigan Avenue, and would be paved in granite, with trees and a large reflecting pond. Underneath the building and plaza were to be commercial spaces and parking, as well as an existing single-track railroad line leading to Navy Pier. Along the river edge, Graham designed a curvilinear promenade for a riverfront restaurant with a helical staircase down from the plaza above.  Today  Equitable itself, now called AXA, no longer maintains offices in the building, which is currently marketed as 401 North Michigan. It remains a successful office tower. In 2003, NBC 5 Chicago opened a street- level studio at the lobby level of the Equitable Building, becoming the first Chicago television station to open such a studio, and starting a trend. ABC 7 Chicago and CBS 2 would open their own street-level studios several years later in other downtown locations. In 2017 the riverfront restaurant and helical staircase were replaced by a new flagship store for Apple, also with the address 401 N Michigan Ave, and designed by the London-based architecture firm Foster + Partners. Pioneer Court, often mistakenly called \\"Pioneer Plaza\\", is largely the great civic space imagined at the time of its construction. Since it was built, it has hosted numerous art installations, performances, civic events, advertising events, and festivals. It has also been featured in several films and television advertisements. In 1992, Pioneer Court was redesigned and extended eastward around the office tower by Cooper, Robertson & Partners in a vaguely Postmodernist style, in conjunction with the massive Cityfront Center development just to the east.

It was first released in the 7th Reitaisai on March 14, 2010. In English speaking circles, the game's title is often shortened to just Double Spoiler, and abbreviated to DS.  Gameplay  Double Spoiler inherited the system of its predecessor Shoot the Bullet, where the player cannot shoot projectiles at enemies; instead, the main character must shoot photographs to clear the screen of bullets and take down bosses. Scores are determined by the aesthetics of each photograph taken, such as colours and bullet density, and the risk taken to take these photos. For each \\"scene\\", the player is only given one life to complete the objective ‚Äî to take a certain number of pictures of the boss without being hit in a limited amount of time. To take pictures, the film must be fully loaded into the camera (100%). The player can move at three speeds, the normal speed, the focused speed, and a super-focused speed which also allows for high speed film loading. When taking pictures, the player can hold the shoot button to control the viewfinder while the picture frame shrinks ‚Äî this can be used to zoom in on the boss. During this time, all bullets on screen are slowed down and the player cannot move. If the shoot button is held for too long, the film will get exposed and the player would have to reload the film. The player can also press the shoot button once without holding to take a snapshot around the player character. For every picture taken, the player will need to reload the film from 0% again before he can take another picture. Only photos that contain an image of the boss (\\"Success\\" pictures) will be taken into account when tallying up the score. New to Double Spoiler over Shoot the Bullet is the option to change the orientation of the shot between landscape to portrait. The angle of the shot is automatically adjusted depending on where the player is in relation to the boss. Characters *Aya Shameimaru: One of the main characters of Double Spoiler and boss of Level Spoiler. As the tengu reporter of the Gensokyo newspaper Bunbunmaru Shinbun, she goes to search for suitable news topics by taking pictures of bullet patterns with her analog camera. No one actually knows what she does with these pictures except herself. *Hatate Himekaidou: Second main character of Double Spoiler and boss of Level Spoiler. Hatate is a modern tengu reporter who makes a newspaper called Kakashi Nenpo. Unlike Aya, she never goes outside for her newspaper research, but instead uses her ability called \\"spirit photography\\".

Klagenfurt: Leustik.) is a village in the Municipality of Ribnica in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Name Grƒçarice was first attested in written sources in 1498 as Masern. The German name Masern is derived from the Old High German root maser 'knotty growth on a tree'. This semantically corresponds to the Slovene root grƒça 'knot', which may be the basis of the Slovene name Grƒçarice.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 152. Other theories of the origin of the Slovene name are that it is based on the surname Grƒçar, in turn derived from the Slovene common noun grƒça (in the sense of 'clod, clump', among many other meanings), or that it is derived from grnƒçar 'potter', implying that the village was settled by potters. History Grƒçarice was a Gottschee German village. In the land registry of 1574 it had six full farms divided into 12 half-farms, corresponding to a population between 50 and 60. The village of Brunn bei Masern, also attested in 1574, may have been absorbed into Grƒçarice soon thereafter or may have become the nearby village of Mrzli Potok.Simoniƒç, Ivan. 1935. \\"Koƒçevarji v luƒçi krajevnih in ledinskih imen.\\" Glasnik Muzejskega dru≈°tva za Slovenijo 16: 61‚Äì81 and 106‚Äì123, p. 81. Countess Elizabeth von Blagay granted additional territory to Grƒçarice for settlement in 1613 because of overpopulation. In the 1770 census there were 28 houses in the village. On 24 July 1882 a major fire started in Johann Sbaƒçnik's (= Sbaschnig, Zbaƒçnik) threshing room at Grƒçarice no. 28. The fire spread and burned down 15 houses and 41 outbuildings in the village, but no livestock were lost and there were no human fatalities. The village church was also damaged in the fire.\\"Br√§nde in Kotschen und Masern.\\" 1882. Laibacher Zeitung 185 (14 August): 1586. A school was established in Grƒçarice in 1883, when a businessman named Stampfl purchased a house and donated it for this purpose. The school operated until 1941. Before World War II, Grƒçarice had 61 houses and a population of 256. During this time the local economy was based on agriculture, timber transport, peddling, and the local steam-powered sawmill. Beekeeping was also practiced in the village. There was a store in the village and an inn that offered overnight accommodation.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 212. The original inhabitants were evicted in the fall of 1941. From 8 to 10 September 1943 there was a battle at Grƒçarice between Slovenian Chetnik forces and the Partisan ≈†ercer Brigade (). After World War II, settlers moved to the village from Gla≈æuta and Lo≈°ki Potok. Agriculture was largely abandoned in the village, with only some small-scale potato cultivation and raising of cattle and pigs. Most of the population lived as forestry workers involved in cutting and transporting timber, or commuted to work in Ribnica or Prigorica. Some of them gathered nightshade and linden blossoms for the local angling club. Two beekeepers were active in the village after the war.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 562. Church *The church in Grƒçarice was dedicated to Saints Primus and Felician. It originally belonged to the proto-parish of Ribnica, obtained an independent prebendary in 1767, and became a parish in its own right in 1878. A bell tower was added to the church in 1845. The building was damaged in 1943 and its ruins were removed in 1949.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 1830 Other cultural heritage *The cemetery in Grƒçarice was established in 1838 and served the villages of Grƒçarice, Grƒçarske Ravne, Jelendol, and Gla≈æuta.

It was said, \\"Of all the tribal chiefs of Hazara, the most powerful [was] said to be Jehandad Khan of the Tanoli.\\". His territories lay on both banks of the Indus, and Jehandad Khan was highly respected among his peoples as the son of Painda Khan. In the words of Major J. Abbott When Sikh power was on the decline in 1845, Jehandad Khan blockaded the garrisons of no less than 22 Sikh posts in Upper Tanawal; and when they surrendered, he spared their lives, as the servants of a fallen Empire. Colonel H. B. Edwards later commented on this \\"The act, however, stood him afterwards in good stead; for, when Hazara was assigned to Maharaja Golab Singh, that politic ruler rewarded Jehandad Khan's humanity with the jagir of Koolge and Badnuck in Lower Tannowul.\\"In a letter dated \\"Peshawar, 10 December 1858\\", from Lt.

The British Government considered \\"Upper Tannowul\\" as a chiefship held under the British Government, but as a rule they did not possess internal jurisdiction within it. The Chief managed his own people in his own way, without regard to the laws, rules or systems of British India. This tenure resembled that of the Chiefs of Patiala, Jhind, Nabha, Kapurthala, and others.Letter dated 21 March 1863 from Thomas Douglas Forsyth, Officiating Secretary to the Government of Punjab, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, quoted in A Collection of Papers relating to the History, Status and Powers of The Nawab of Amb, (Punjab Secretariat, 1874), p. 58 In 1852, Jehandad Khan was ordered by the President of the Board of Administration, who was visiting Hazara to see him at Haripur about the murder of two British officers, Messrs. Carne and Tapp of the Salt Department, who had been killed in the country of Jehandad Khan in 1851. When the President ordered the Khan to give up the murderers or else suffer the consequences, which might be the burning down of villages and his region being given to another ruler, the Khan is reported to have replied \\"We should consider your presence in our kingdom an honour, but our country is a rather difficult one for your army.\\" However, for all his public bravado, the Khan recognised his limitations and in private protested his innocence to the British administrators, and was eventually cleared of the charges.Allen, pp 203-204 In due course, Mir Jehandad Khan was granted the personal and temporary title of 'Nawab', which in succeeding generations was to be granted to the family in perpetuity. When he died, the Khan left a nine- year-old son, Muhammad Akram Khan, who succeeded him.

Schettino spent his whole career in Lega Pro (ex-Serie C). Biography=Torino Born in Castellammare di Stabia, the Province of Naples, Schettino started his career at Torino Calcio in the northern city of Turin. He was part of Allievi Nazionali team in 2000-01 season. Roma and false accounting scandal In June 2002 signed by Roma in co-ownership deal, which Torino also got Daniele Martinetti in co-ownership in exchange. He signed a 3-year contract.

It is native to and widespread in southern Africa where it inhabits mesic to semi-arid grasslands. Due to the snout on the head of soldiers, and their grass collecting habits, they are known as snouted harvester termites. Range and habitat It is found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and is widely distributed and common south of the Limpopo River. The species lives in savannah or grassland areas, and avoids barren land. Related species are found in the east of the subcontinent. Biology The snouted harvester termite is a mostly nocturnal species.K. E. Holekamp (2007). ‚ÄúAardwolf: Diet and Foraging‚Äù. Hyaena Specialist Group. The species stores grass within its mounds, just beneath the surface. Evidence showed that it is likely that the species is not polycalic and thus each mound will house only a single colony. Foraging behavior It forages with groups of 3-5 individual wide columns moving from the foraging holes some distance from the main mound and radiating out towards grasses. The species forages during the night and avoids foraging during the winter months of June‚ÄìAugust. The foraging itself could last anywhere from 2 hours to 6.5 hours. It feeds as harvester termite. It forages at night. The species forages on the surface completely exposed unlike most similar species of termite. This species is able to manage this by secreting a chemical containing a mixture of diterpenes and monoterpenes. This chemical defense can cause significant internal damage to predators and works to deter the large majority of predators. One of their main predators is aardwolves, which are able to eat up to 300,000 termites a night while seeming unperturbed by this toxin.P. R. K. Richardson, C. D. Levitan (1994). ‚ÄúTolerance of Aardwolves to Defense Secretions of Trinervitermes trinervoides‚Äù. Journal of Mammalogy 75 (1): 84-91. doi: 10.2307/1382238 Effect on the land The mounding building causes disturbances that build nutritional value as well as improving drainage and fertility. All of these improve vegetation and thus herbivore concentration in an area. Oftentimes these disturbances can be strong enough to switch the ecosystem from a grassy vegetated area to a tree, shrub, and pioneer species landscape.F. R. Smith, R. I. Yeaton (1998). ‚ÄúDisturbance by the mound-building termite, Trinervitermes trinervoides, and vegetation patch dynamics in a semi- arid, southern African grassland‚Äù. Plant Ecology 137 (1): 44-53. Studies have shown that the composition and abundance of plant life on and around a Trinervitermes trinervoides mound vary depending on the mound age. Active mounds support the growth of both a climax and a pioneer grass in the immediate area, while an eroded mound supports subclimax grass and shrubs. It is shown that soils that contain eroded mounds have higher nutrient contents than soils as close as 0.5 meters away. The species has developed a method of foraging and storing the grass it collects near the surface of the mounds. Because they rely on open cover foraging, which in winter might be unavailable, and unlike most species of termite they store their food to avoid leaving the mound when the cold makes this difficult. Soldiers are also used to defend the foragers while the food is collected, having them patrol between their holes and the foraging area continuously.

On hearing this, the noble soldier Balthazar works on the conscience of the king to take back Onaelia. Despite the threat of civil war, the king refuses. Count Malatesta proposes to the queen that she pretend to be pregnant, to sound the hearts of the Spanish people. Roderigo, Lopez, and Valasco, dons of Spain, rally to the cause of their majesties against the duke of Medina's faction. Angered at her rival, the queen proposes to Balthazar the murder of Onaelia and her son, to which he pretends to acquiesce after receiving the king's command. But, loyal to Onaelia, Balthazar announces these plots to Medina, who disguises himself as a French doctor to gain access to the king. When the disguised Medina speaks to the king, he becomes convinced of the legitimacy of the king's plot to murder his niece as well as Balthazar's loyalty. To appease the rebellious faction, the king proposes a marriage between Onaelia and Cockadillio, a courtier, an offer which is accepted. The queen and Malateste again confer, deciding to poison Onaelia. During the marriage ceremony, the king takes up the poisoned cup meant for Onaelia, to the queen's and Malateste's consternation. While the king is drinking, Malateste admits their crime and is stabbed to death by the faction. While dying, the king passes the crown to Sebastian and commands that the queen be sent back to Florence with treble dowry. Onaelia and Balthazar are appointed to protect Sebastian in his youth. Sources, Authorship and Date The first clear reference to the play is dated as 16 May 1631 when an entry was made in the Stationer's Register, effectively licensing texts for publication. The entry, made for John Jackman, referred to manuscripts of two plays by ‚ÄòTho: Dekker‚Äô, these being ‚ÄòThe Wonder of a Kingdom‚Äô and ‚Äòa Tragedy called The Noble Spanish Soldier‚Äô. A similar entry was made on 9 December 1633, this time for Nicholas Vavasour. The play was printed in a quarto version in 1634, probably by John Beale, on behalf of Vavasour, who initialled the foreword entitled ‚ÄòThe Printer to The Reader‚Äô. These aspects of the play have attracted more critical attention than all others combined, reference frequently being made to the following known facts: (1) Although the entries in the Stationer‚Äôs Register refer unambiguously to Dekker as the author, the title page of the Quarto states that the play is written by ‚ÄòS.R.‚Äô, the only Jacobean playwright with those initials being Samuel Rowley. (2) It has been observed, initially by nineteenth century scholar A. H. Bullen, that three sections of a play by John Day called 'The Parliament of Bees‚Äô are nearly identical to sections of NSS. Furthermore, a further five sections correspond closely to parts of 'The Wonder of a Kingdom‚Äô which as is noted above, was registered alongside NSS in 1931. (3) In 1601, theatre manager Philip Henslowe made part payment for an anonymous play called 'The Spanish Fig', no text of which survives under that name. (4) In April 1624 a poster appeared in Norwich advertising a touring play, being 'An excellent Comedy called 'The Spanish Contract‚Äô to be performed by Lady Elizabeth's men, a company with which Dekker is believed to have had connections. (5) There is some evidence of confusion in how the play has been compiled for printing, in particular, a cast list which omits several significant characters, the late appearance of two pointless characters (Signor No and Juanna) and the delayed identification of Alanzo as Captain of the Guard. These have been argued to be evidence of revision of an earlier work. (6) Dekker's 'The Welsh Embassador‚Äô reworked much of the material in NSS, albeit in a comedic form. This is generally dated as c1623. As may be imagined, these facts offer a considerable range of possibilities as to authorship and provenance of the play. Various critics, such as Fleay and Bullen, have tried to make sense of all of them by postulating, largely without evidence, a variety of permutations of collaboration and revision so as to give all of the authorship candidates a role in the production of the text we now have. The most persuasive contribution however, comes from Julia Gasper who, building on work by R. Koeppel, convincingly identifies the source of NSS as being Volume V of Jacques-Augueste de Thou's Latin 'Historiarum Sui Temporis', published in 1620.Gasper, J ‚Äì 'The Noble Spanish Soldier', 'The Wonder of a Kingdom' and 'The Parliament of Bees': a belated solution to this long-standing problem ‚Äì Durham University Journal LXXIX number 2- 1987. The de Thou volume tells of how Henry IV of France reneged on a written promise of marriage to Hentiette d‚ÄôEntragues, by marrying Marie de' Medici in 1600; both women bore sons by the King, who is later assassinated. This closely anticipates the marriage plot of NSS but the critical detail which seals the identification of de Thou as the source, is his reference to a soldier called Balthazare Sunica who acted against the King and was clearly, the original of the character Balthazar in NSS. This evidence demonstrates that the earliest date for composition of NSS is 1620. Furthermore, due to the likelihood that NSS predated 'The Welsh Embassador‚Äô of 1623/4, a last possible date for the writing of NSS can also be deduced and a composition date of around 1622 can be established with some certainty. With respect to the relationship with other plays, any connection with 'The Spanish Fig‚Äô would seem to be ruled out on the grounds that it pre- dates the publication of de Thou's Historiarum. In the case of the later play 'The Spanish Contract', a connection is possible although any theories that may be advanced little more than conjecture. One such theory, put forward by Tirthanker Bose,Bose, T ‚Äì 'The Noble Spanish Soldier‚Äô and 'The Spanish Contract‚Äô in Notes and Queries v 40, number 2 ‚Äì 1993. is that 'the Spanish Contract‚Äô is a version of NSS, reworked as a comedy and thus is an intermediate stage on the road to 'The Welsh Embassador'. The more pressing matter, the question of the connection with 'The Parliament of Bees', is also addressed by Julia Gasper. The crucial evidence here relates to instances where details, meaningful only in the context of NSS, have become embedded in the text of 'The Parliament of Bees'. The most significant example of this occurs in Scene 1, Line 29 of 'The Parliament of Bees‚Äô where a character asks 'Is Master Bee at leisure to speak Spanish / With a Bee of Service?‚Äô. There is no connection between 'The Parliament of Bees‚Äô and Spain or indeed, the Spanish language, so it would seem strong evidence that NSS was the source for 'The Parliament of Bees‚Äô and not the other way around. This evidence is supplemented by an analysis of NSS, Act 2 Scene 1, a scene common to both plays, when Balthazar sets out his credentials of loyal service in seeking to advise the King. Gasper points out that this scene in NSS contains elements from de Thou, not to be found in The Parliament of Bees, principally the need to intervene on behalf of Onaelia. The only plausible order of composition for the plays therefore places NSS before 'The Parliament of Bees'. Furthermore, as Day's name has never been associated with NSS, there is no reason to suppose he was involved in its composition. The likelihood is therefore that he was lifting dialogue from an earlier work by another writer to serve his own convenience. The remaining question to be considered concerns the relative claims to authorship of Dekker and Rowley. In weighing the evidence, it is important to consider that the first records, those on the Stationer's Register, unequivocally record Dekker as the sole author. Furthermore, textual scholarship is happy to place NSS within the Dekker cannon, while, as Hoy says 'no scholar has ever succeeded in demonstrating Rowley's share in the play‚Äô.3\\\\. Hoy, C. ‚Äì Introductions, notes, and commentaries to texts in 'The dramatic works of Thomas Dekker, Volume IV, page 99 ‚Äì Cambridge University Press ‚Äì 1980 Given that it has been established that the play post-dates 1620, the possibility of a Dekker revision of an earlier Rowley text would appear to be implausible. The attribution to ‚ÄòS.R.‚Äô remains unexplained, although it may be noted in passing that the initials are the final letters of Dekker's names, so it may just be a coded reference to Dekker. More likely perhaps, it could be the result of the editorial confusion which led to the title page being headed 'The Noble Soldier' and also pervades the compilation of the cast list. Commentary The sub-title given to the text in the Quarto edition is 'A contract Broken, Justly Revenged'. Although this title is likely to have been added by the printers, it does succinctly sum up one aspect the play, the theme of revenge which is reminiscent of Elizabethan revenge plays such as Thomas Kyd's 'The Spanish Tragedy'. Revenge plays however, are generally patterned around a revenger and what may be termed a ‚Äòrevengee‚Äô, while the action of NSS revolves around a power struggle between two factions both of whom are concerned with violent intent. In reality, the play reflects the seventeenth century fashion for mixing elements of tragedy and comedy in a style first identified by Sir Philip Sydney in 1579 as being 'mongrel tragicomedy‚Äô;4\\\\. Sidney, Sir Philip, 'The Defense of Posey‚Äô in 'The Norton Anthology of English Literature', page 944 ‚Äì Norton ‚Äì 2000. thus while death intrudes on the final act, it only strikes unsympathetic characters. There is also regular light relief provided by two comic characters, Cornego and Cockadillio, as well the cameo appearances of Signor No and Medina as a French Doctor. The two groups of characters at the centre of the play are on one hand, the ruling cabal, that is the King, his Italian Queen and their supporters, including the Italian Malateste, and on the other a number of disenchanted Spanish noblemen who are in sympathy with the King's former betrothed lover, Onaelia. This later faction, led by the Duke of Medina, eventually includes the key figure of the patriotic soldier Balthazar, a man who has earned respect for his martial exploits and whose ‚Äònobility‚Äô, as celebrated in the title to the play, is a tribute earned by action rather than by birth or inheritance. He is thus differentiated from the King, whose nobility of birth is cancelled out by the dishonesty of his character. Nevertheless, Balthazar is something of a problematic figure and in many ways an unconvincing hero for a play with ostensibly, a strong moral theme. His basic character is presented as that of an honest uncomplicated soldier; in his first appearance(2.1), he has already been slighted by the Dons, and presents an unkempt appearance and rails against the ‚Äòpied-winged butterflies‚Äô of the effete court who put appearance before patriotic duty. Nevertheless, subterfuge seems to come too readily to him as we see in 2.2 when he makes a false offer to assassinate the King to test Onaelia, again in 3.3 when he pretends to agree to murder Sebastian and Onaelia to placate the Queen and finally in 5.1 when he tells the King that the murder has been carried out. Scene 3.3 shows a further unedifying side of Balthazar when he bursts in on the King and stabs a servant and refuses to express remorse as the servant is a mere groom. On a different note, the character is also used to comic effect, especially in 4.2 when he acts out bawdy dialogue with Cornego. His last significant act is to dissuade the faction from attempting to assassinate the King, before being reduced to a minor role in the closing scene where he only has five short speeches and plays no significant part in the denouement. The character then, is something of a patchwork affair, playing different roles as the play progresses before being effectively jettisoned at the conclusion. The King by contrast maintains a degree of consistency, notwithstanding his formulaic deathbed renunciation of evil. As we have seen, his Queen is Italian, but he may be associated with Italy by more reasons than his marriage. In Act 5 Scene 2, Daenia says that ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs in his breast / Both fox and lion, and both those beasts can bite‚Äô This is a direct reference to the works of the Italian courtier Niccol√≤ Machiavelli who wrote in his work on statecraft 'The Prince‚Äô: 'A Prince must know how to make good use of the beasts; he should choose from among the beasts the fox and the lion; for the lion cannot defend itself from traps and the fox cannot protect itself from wolves.‚Äô.Machiavelli, N. ‚Äì 'The Prince', page 56 ‚Äì Penguin ‚Äì 2003. Although the book from which this extract was taken, 'The Prince', had yet to be published in English, the ideas it contained (or at least a caricature of them) had been in circulation for many years following its initial publication in Italy in 1531. These were often treated with profound suspicion by the English who saw the advocacy of the use of manipulation and deception to maintain power as being the idea of a disreputable foreign country. Indeed, Machiavelli was seen as a satanic figure who was known as 'Old Nick', a still- used reference to the devil, and the machiavel became a stock figure on the early modern stage, a tradition which the portrayal of the King is drawing on. The other interesting opposition within the play is between the two claimants to the title of Queen, the current incumbent and Onaelia. There is little doubt that it is Onaelia who is the representative of virtue, her behaviour often rising above that of the ‚Äònoble‚Äô Balthazar. In Act 1 Scene 2 she makes a fearless statement in defacing the King's portrait, this being an act of treason.See Bowers, F. ‚Äì 'The Stabbing of a Portrait in Elizabethan Tragedy‚Äô ‚Äì Modern language Notes, XLVII, pages 378‚Äì385 ‚Äì 1932. Despite her strong feelings however, she does not rise to Balthazar's bait when he introduces the possibility of assassinating the King; the remnants of her love for him and her concern for the stability of the realm rule this possibility out. She is not however prepared to accept her treatment without protest and, in Act 3 Scene 2, engages a poet to propagandise on her behalf. His refusal, on the grounds of self-preservation is denounced in striking terms when she accuses poets generally of being 'apt to lash / Almost to death poor wretches not worth striking / but fawn with slavish flattery on damned vices / so great men act them'. The effective conclusion of her involvement as early as the end of 3.2 impoverishes the rest of the play. The Queen's less admirable character is highlighted by the way she is prepared to condone the taking of life to secure her position. Her ruthless outlook is punished when she is deprived of her position and forced to return to Italy . The final scene of the play utilises a dramatic technique that had played an important part in Dekker's most famous play, The Shoemaker's Holiday: the banquet scene. Planned by the King in an attempt to achieve reconciliation and remove the threat of Onaelia by marrying her off, it represents a means of bringing almost the entire cast on stage to witness the meting out of justice. It is ironic that the King's scheme is undermined, not by his political rivals but by his allies, The Queen and Malateste, who do not believe that the marriage will provide a stable settlement and instead seek to pursue a deadlier course of action. The banquet provides the context for the unwinding of this plot as vengeance consumes itself, bringing about the regime change that justice demands.

It fuses image-intensifying and thermal-imaging technologies, enabling vision in conditions with very little light. The two methods can be used simultaneously or individually. The ENVG was selected by the US Army's Program Executive Office Soldier (PEO Soldier) as a supporting device for the Future Force Warrior program in 2004, and is intended to replace the older AN/PVS-7 and AN/PVS-14 systems. Although more expensive and heavier than previous models, US Special Forces began using the goggles in 2008 and the US Army's 10th Mountain Division began fielding the AN/PSQ-20 in 2009. Improvements to the goggles have been attempted to make them lighter, as well as enabling the transmission of digital images to and from the battlefield. Development In August 2003, PEO Soldier, the acquisition agency of the US Army, started evaluating designs from ITT Industries and Northrop Grumman for an advanced night vision device that could support the planned Future Force Warrior program. Of the two competing designs, the ITT design which was developed in association with Raytheon, was chosen for development in July 2004 with an initial order for 75 systems. Development testing of the ENVG with the US Army, designated AN/PSQ-20, began by mid-2006, which was completed in March 2007. Operational testing started in June 2007, with low-rate initial production of the device beginning around the same time. ITT were given a five-year contract in April 2005 with a potential value of US$560 million, with the view of replacing the existing AN/PVS-7 and AN/PVS-14. Design and features The AN/PSQ-20 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle combines image intensifier (I2 or II) and infra-red (IR, also called thermal imaging) technologies, and is the first night vision device to do so. Before this \\"fusing\\", these two technologies could only be used separately. The AN/PSQ-20 allows both methods to be used together or individually, and can be helmet-mounted or hand held. It is roughly the same size as the AN/PVS-14 with similar controls, and is powered by four AA type batteries allowing continuous combined use of II and IR for 7.5 hours. The device can be used for a further 7.5 hours in image intensifier mode. Classified as a third-generation passive night vision device, the AN/PSQ-20 can provide vision through thermal imaging even in situations where there isn't enough ambient light for the image intensifiers, thus eliminating the need for infra-red illumination (active night vision). It can also see through battlefield obscurants such as smoke and fog. The combined technologies allow better target identification and recognition, thereby improving the soldier's mobility and situational awareness. The center of gravity of the device is close to the face of the wearer, making the helmet-mounted use more comfortable, as well as increasing stability. Aiming lasers can also be integrated with it. However, at a unit cost of US$18,000 and with a weight of almost , the AN/PSQ-20 is more expensive and heavier than the devices it is intended to replace. FWS-I combination In 2019, the Army plans to begin fielding the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual (FWS-I), an optic that can be mounted on various weapons like the M4 carbine, M16A4 rifle, M249 SAW, M136 AT4, and M141 Bunker Defeat Munition. The FWS-I is designed to work with the ENVG-III by transmitting data from the scope to the goggles, so the soldier can aim the weapon without needing to raise it to their eye. Both systems were brought together under the Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) capability that combined two separate programs of record with separate devices together to make them interoperable. The goggles are connected through fiber optic wires to a processor on the back of the helmet that wirelessly communicates with the weapon-mounted FWS-I; because of the systems' short range and low power, jamming the wireless connection is not a concern. Connecting with the ENVG-III also expands field of vision from a scope's 18-26 degrees to the goggle's 40 degrees. By seeing what the scope sees through the goggles, soldiers can point their weapons out of defilade positions like over walls and around corners and fire accurately without exposing their head or torso to enemy fire. The US Army first experimented with aiming and shooting weapons behind cover during the Land Warrior program, but it relied on connecting wires between the helmet-mounted display and weapon-mounted thermal sight that could get caught, and early sights were too heavy and bulky.New technology will link night vision and rifle scope - Armytimes.com, 24 July 2015Army Links New Thermal Scope and ENVG with Wireless Connection - Kitup.Military.com, 23 July 2015New Technologies to Improve Soldiers‚Äô Detection and Targeting Capabilities - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 23 July 2015New night vision gear allows Soldiers to accurately shoot from hip - Army.mil, 22 July 2015Army: New Wireless Sight Offers Leap-Ahead for Night Marksmanship - Military.com, 23 July 2015 Service and improvements The AN/PSQ-20 ENVG was first issued to the US Army in April 2008. The 10th Mountain Division received about 300 units in February 2009, making it the first non-special forces unit to use the device. PM Soldier Sensors and Lasers, which is part of PEO Soldier, has been working on making the AN/PSQ-20 more rugged by using tougher housing material. Efforts have also been made to make the device lighter, as well as to produce and transmit digital images of the view provided. As a result, a prototype named Digital Enhanced Night Vision Goggle or ENVG (D) was provided to the US Army for evaluation in June 2009, which enables digitally fused images to be exported and imported. As of July 2015, the US Army had bought about 9,000 ENVG-I and 16,000 ENVG-II units. Beginning in FY 2017, the ENVG-III is expected to begin fielding, with a total of 41,000 to be produced by BAE Systems and DRS Technologies. Like previous versions, the ENVG-III allows soldiers to choose between night vision, thermal, hybrid, and a hybrid where thermal images show up with an outline, but extends the thermal capacity out to the entire 40-degree field of view rather than just a circle in the middle, and has a sleeker design for the device and battery pack, improved resolution, is lighter at less than , and is designed to work with the FWS-I. Plans are to equip 24 ENVGs per platoon, with each costing an estimated US$10,000, cheaper than previous versions due to competition and improved technology.

Born in Birmingham, as a child he edited together cut up cassette tapes to make his first \\"mixes\\". At age 16 he started DJing and made the transition from cassette to vinyl. His first residency was at the Ministry of Sound in Birmingham. Initially associated with the Asian Underground movement, then drum & bass, he is now a proponent of alternative and electronic music and curates festivals, radio shows, clubnights and soundtracks. Early life Nerm's passion for music and mixing started at the age of 10 whilst playing around with some D90 cassette tapes. Early career Nerm gained press and TV attention in 2000 as the dancer in the electro-punk band Charged, signed to Nation Records. Around the same time he became the headline DJ at London's underground clubnight, Swaraj. Swaraj was the platform on which Nerm pioneered Shiva Soundsystem, by amalgamating the live energy of a band with the dance floor by integrating musicians in his sets. Shiva Soundsystem began as a group, which then progressed into an extensive association of musicians, producers and DJs whose headquarters was a large warehouse space in Hackney, East London. Shiva Soundsystem helped introduce new, acts from across the world to clubbing audiences in London. Breakthrough Nerm, alongside Shiva Soundsystem, curated events, first running parties at their warehouse HQ with international guest performers, then, more legitimately, playing weekend residencies in East London's underground night clubs. Herbal in Shoreditch and Vibe Bar in Brick Lane were two such residencies which featured guests such as Aphex Twin, Commix, Andrew Weatherall, Logistics, Colin Dale, Moving Fusion and Sub Swara. New live bands and offshoot live projects of other acts also featured including Aziz, Ian Brown's guitarist and co-writer of his debut solo album. Shiva Soundsystem toured India and played Glastonbury every year from 2002. In 2005 Shiva Soundsystem became a record label to release production from the collective and other associated artists. The first drum & bass/bass mix album fashioned for India, titled India:One was mixed and released by Nerm. Shiva Soundsystem's releases obtained support from Pete Tong, Pendulum and Laurent Garnier. Media In tandem with Shiva Soundsystem came invitations for Nerm to host and share his passion for underground music with interest from TV and radio channels including E! Channel (Venezuela), Radio 1 MTV India and BBC 2 which led to Nerm's progression as a broadcaster, at first on the BBC Asian Network radio station with his weekly show Electro East. Electro East represented a wide spectrum of underground music from across the world with artists at the beginning of their ascents to stars as guests including Chase and Status, Noisia, Benga and Brookes Brothers and more specialist artists enduser, V.I.V.E.K (Deep Medi) and Amit (Commercial Suicide) In 2008, with label-mate D-Code, Nerm embarked on a two-year run on BBC Radio 1 featuring a range of underground music. Guests included a series of \\"vs\\" DJ battles: *Foreign Beggars vs Drum & Bass (production from Noisia and Alix Perez) *DJ Marky vs Norman Jay *Rusko vs John B *Appleblim vs Filthy Dukes *Matt Helders (Arctic Monkeys) vs London Elektricity *Sub Focus vs The Count & Sinden Nerm & D-Code also stood in for Mary Anne Hobbs, Ras Kwame and for 1Xtra‚Äôs Drum & Bass Mix Show and presented alongside Annie Mac and Zane Lowe.

He was an ardent supporter of the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Before the Civil War, Belasyse and his family had a long running confrontation with Sir Thomas Wentworth , a close advisor to King Charles I, primarily over local government issues in Yorkshire. This confrontation did not shake Belasyse's support for the monarchy and before and during the Civil War, he and his son Henry, were ardent supporters of the Royalist cause. Charles honoured Belasye in appreciation, but towards the end of the First Civil War, Belasye was forced to flee abroad. While he was in exile his estates were sequestered by Parliament because he was a known \\"delinquent\\", and on his return to England and as he refused to swear to the oath of abjuration he was convicted of recusancy. Biography Belasyse was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge in the early 1590s. He had Roman Catholic leanings, and married into a known recusant family, but stayed within the laws of the time and attended Anglican Church services. He entered Parliament in 1597 when he was elected to represent Thirsk, a seat his father had held, in the second from last Elizabethan parliament. He was knighted by James I and served as a justice of the peace in the North Riding. He remained active in national politics and represented Thirsk again in the 1614, 1621, and 1624 parliaments of James I.. During the early years of the reign of Charles I the Belasyse family sided with Sir John Savile, the custos rotulorum of the West Riding, against Sir Thomas Wentworth. The Savile's allied themselves with the Duke of Buckingham and it may have been through this political connection that on 25 May 1627 that Belasyse was raised to the peerage as Lord Fauconberg of Yarm.. After the assassination of Buckingham, Wentworth's influence at court grew and with it his power, while that of his political opponents Yorkshire waned. After Wentworths's appointment as president of the council of the north in 1628, Fauconberg and his son Henry were briefly imprisoned and they opposed the style of government that Wentworth's influence at court helped to foster. With the impeachment and execution of Wentworth, now 1st Earl of Strafford, in 1641 Fauconberg political fortunes waxed. Like many of the gentry and nobility with Roman Catholic leanings he supported Charles I in his struggle with Parliament. During the summer of 1642, in the months before the war started while Charles resided in York, Fauconberg and his sons Henry and John were prominent supporters. His elder son Henry a Knight of the Shire signed a treaty of neutrality with Thomas Fairfax, (but its terms were rejected by Parliament) and John his other son commanded a regiment of Foot. Fauconberg's loyalty to Charles was rewarded on 31 January 1643 he was granted the title of Viscount Fauconberg of Henknowle, county Durham (his second son, John, was made Baron Belasys of Worlaby in 1645). Fauconberg supported William Cavendish, Marquis of Newcastle, followed the fortunes of that nobleman in the siege of York, which held out three months against powerful Scottish and Parliamentary armies. When the Royalists garrison of York and a relieving army under the command of Prince Rupert lost the Battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644, Newcastle and Fauconberg escaped into exile, embarking at Scarborough, for Hamburg. While he was abroad his estates were sequestered for his delinquency, which he compounded by paying a fine of ¬£5012 18s. He returned to the North Riding in 1649 but refused to swear the Oath of Abjuration and was convicted of recusancy. He died on 18 April 1653, and was buried in the parish church of Coxwold, in the county of York. Family Fauconberg married Barbara Cholmley (c. 1575 ‚Äì 28 February 1619), the daughter of Sir Henry Cholmley of Roxby in Whitby Strand, a family noted for its recusancy. Their daughter Barbara Belasyse (1609/1610 ‚Äì 1641) married in 1631 Sir Henry Slingsby of Scriven, 1st Baronet.http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/familytree.html His eldest son Henry predeceased him in 1647, his eldest son, Thomas, Fauconberg's grandson, inherited the title. Unlike his grandfather and father Thomas supported the Parliamentary cause, and later married Mary, a daughter of Oliver Cromwell. Fauconberg's second son John was raised to the peerage by Charles II as Baron Belasyse.

He was the President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 1885. Family He was born into a Hungarian Catholic family of Walloon origin in Homonna, Zempl√©n County, Kingdom of Hungary (today Humenn√©, Slovakia). His great-grandfather worked as a lawyer in Belgium, his medical officer grandfather came to Hungary in the 1770s. √Ågoston's father was Ign√°c Trefort (1770‚Äì1831), a famous surgeon, and his mother was Tekla Beldovics (died 1829). They married in 1816, when Ign√°c's first wife died. They had three children: √Ågoston, Antal (died in his infancy) and Istv√°n (born 1825, year of death unknown).

Studies He already spoke on the time of his grammar school studies in German, in Latin and in Slovak. Trefort lost his parents during the cholera epidemic of 1831. He found his way under Countess Petronella Cs√°ky's guardianship. He studied on the Lyceum of Eger, then he started his higher studies on the Faculty of Law of the University of Pest. He learnt in English, in French and in Italian, thanking for his excellent gift for languages duly. Then he made his juridical practice at the district board on Eperjes. Trefort finished his studies at the age of eighteen. He started his first big Western European round trip by favour of the paternal heritage and the Cs√°ky family in April 1836. He returned to Hungary in February 1837. Trefort passed his lawyer's exam with a distinguished result on 22 December 1837. He stood into a state service then, and chamber president G√°bor Keglevich appointed him a free trainee at the Buda court chamber on 17 April 1838. Trefort became a member of the National Casino, where he made lot of friends and connections. Among others he got acquainted with J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s here. Political career Trefort's interest turned into the direction of the literature in this time. He suggested to foundation of a M≈±v√©szeti Egylet onto the nursing of the Hungarian fine arts. This was his first appearance before the publicity, and the work society, for which he was the first president, was the result of this. The centralist group formed in these times, notable members were E√∂tv√∂s, Trefort and historian L√°szl√≥ Szalay. Trefort became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at the age of twenty-four. He participated in the works of the Industry Society and the Hungarian Trading Company. He was member of the National Assembly of Hungary of 1833/1844 as a delegate of Z√≥lyom. He was selected to a member of a committee, which negotiated about the commercial affairs. He published for the Pesti H√≠rlap about actual political questions (credit bank, inheritance, tax, industrialisation). On 14 March 1847 Trefort married to Ilona Rostly, daughter of vice ispan Albert Rostly, so Trefort became E√∂tv√∂s' brother-in-law, because E√∂tv√∂s' wife, √Ågnes Rostly was sister of Ilona. On 16 March 1848 (one day after the revolution broke out) he was appointed to the Vice-regency council's interim press policing department. He received officer rank in the militia of Pest. In the cabinet of Prime Minister Lajos Batthy√°ny he served as state secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Trade. After murder of Ferenc Lamberg he emigrated to Vienna, after that M√ºnchen with his family. They returned to home in September 1850. He lived in B√©k√©s County separately, at the end of the 1850s he engaged in the county public affairs. Trefort founded the B√©k√©s County Economical Association. He appointed the county's first vice ispan on 11 December 1860, but he resigned from this position on 18 March 1861. In this same year he became a member of the National Assembly of Hungary again. Trefort supported the compromise with the Austrians, he was also between the promoters. After death of his wife he moved to Pest. When J√≥zsef E√∂tv√∂s, his closely friend died in 1871, the cabinet offered E√∂tv√∂s' ministerial position to him. He accepted the function with only second occasion, so Trefort became Minister of Religion and Education in 1872. He also served as Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Trade between 21 August 1876 and 5 December 1878. Minister of Religion and education He continued the development of the civil educational system. A ready program was not at his disposal, but he emphasized the importance of the educating the people. He created the ministry's ninth department, which dealt with the building cases. The commercial and industrial educational forms came into the foreground because of the development of the capitalism. The ministry preferred those types of school, which ones not onto human orbits, but foster onto industry, agriculture, trade. Trefort harmonized the public education with the social needs during second half of his ministerial term. E√∂tv√∂s and Trefort's multi-faceted politics yielded the birth of the modern Hungarian higher education. Social political transformation being equal to the capitalist economic development roamed together with this, and the pressure of the economic interests. The society set up his claims opposite the higher education in connection with this. It was the turn of new institutions', departments', laboratories' organization, the change of a curriculum, the increase of the vocational standard as a result of all these. √Ågoston Trefort In 1872 the Polytechnikum became Budapest University of Technology and Economics, and the country's second university opened in Kolozsv√°r. Furthermore, new departments came into existence, the scientific and medical faculty buildings were built, the artistic higher educational institutions organized. He ascribed extraordinary significance to the medical science, the medical training and the public health. With the increase of new buildings, new departments' foundation, the increase of the number of the laboratories, their equipment raised the modernisation (generally) of the higher education, particularly the standard of the medical training. The M≈±egyetem M√∫zeum's boulevard buildings, The University Library, the Faculty of Medical Science were made ready at this time, and along √úll≈ëi √∫t the buildings of the Clinical Quarter. He multiplied the departments' number in the course of his work made on the space of the question of the education. He created new educational and exam order, a disciplinary regulation, he standardize the universities' organization. Moreover, he provided the opportunities of the school founding, professors with outstanding knowledge. With regard to the Faculty's of Arts development important result creating the institution of the seminars and the study time from three raising it to four years. Trefort reformed the teacher- training system in 1873. He united the training of the grammar school and secondary school teachers' training. In the interest of the correction of the standard he organized the teacher examining commission, provided the foreign scholarships. He ordered the regular keeping of the methodological meetings in the schools in the interest of the improvement of the teaching methods. the Act of 1883 took action on the conditions of the teacher qualification and the general requirements of the examinations. Trefort regulated the transition between the civil schools, high schools and the training colleges in his orders. He regulated the commercial schools' organization. Suggested it the industry student schools and central Industry School's erection. In connection with the national question the Magyarization political sketching characterize him, which is after his death, getting stronger turned into really reactionary. He had attacks many times from the denominations' and the left wing. Trefort was struggling along equally to espouse and to develop all of the areas of his wallet. His triple password: public health, economy, public education. He saw the context of the development of the culture clearly with the necessity of the solution of the economic and social questions. Even his literary function served his cultural policy aims. Academic career In 1841 he became corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Later, in 1867 he was promoted full member. He was appointed President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1885, followed Menyh√©rt L√≥nyay in this position. His ministerial occupation limited his academic activity strongly.

The company was established to manufacture automobiles in the country, taking advantage of the advances of Aerotechnical Institute of C√≥rdoba Province.Historia de la f√°brica IAME on Club IAME website At its peak, IAME manufactured (apart from automobiles) airplanes, tractors, motorcycles, motorboats, and weapons. In 1956 it was renamed \\"Direcci√≥n Nacional de Fabricaci√≥n e Investigaci√≥n Aeron√°utica\\" (Spanish for National Directorate of Aeronautical Manufacturing and Research, abbreviated \\"DINFIA\\"). In 1967, it was established that DINFIA focused on aeronautics and aerospace, while the automotive division would be taken over by another company created with that purpose, \\"Industrias Mec√°nicas del Estado\\" (IME).  History = Constitution  After completion of the Five-Year Plans (\\"Plan Quinquenal\\"), the administration of President Juan Per√≥n had failed to establish a solid foundation for the growth of heavy industry. The trade balance in the automotive heading was unfavorable in 1951, imported around 20,000 units. Therefore, Per√≥n met with representatives of major foreign automakers to boost car production in the country. His proposal was rejected by the foreign manufacturers, arguing that Argentina they lacked the necessary expertise for the task and admitting only have a few autoparts Argentina invoice or final assembly in the country of foreign auto parts. In this situation, the Minister of Aviation, Brigadier Juan Ignacio San Mart√≠n, also attending the meeting, proposed to the President producing cars in the country using high industrial knowledge achieved by the Institute Aerot√©cnica.

The first directory was chaired by Juan Ignacio San Martin. Financing funds came from a loan from the Industrial Bank of Argentina of $53,000,000, guaranteed by the State under the doctrine of Peronism. The IAME had 12,000 workers and managers at the time. There were many projects, following a low-cost policy that allowed mass production to achieve low manufacturing costs. It also acquired licenses to produce locally European automotive models of low cost and easy maintenance- mainly Germans-to ensure expertise in the production and adaptation of use. When licenses were not acquired, projects initiated were highly influenced by the original models in question.  Models produced  Justicialista = Justicialista, the first car released by IAME in 1952 By the beginning of the 1950s, some of the most developed countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) were in process to substitute imports. Therefore, the local industry was revitalised in order to build automobiles. In 1949, President of Argentina Juan Per√≥n signed a decree to refurbish part of the Aircraft Factory, adapting it to start manufacturing automobiles. Jos√© Higinio Monserrat was appointed as the first director of the Automobile Factory while engineer Ra√∫l G√≥mez, who work at the Aerotechnical Institute of C√≥rdoba (\\"Institec\\"), was another key figure of IAME.As√≠ era el Institec by Carlos Manzoni, La Naci√≥n, 18 Aug 2018 The first car manufactured by IAME was the Justicialista model in 1952. This car had a body designed in Argentina but inspired on the Chevrolet models of those times. They were powered with Wartburg engines imported from Germany. The first prototype was developed and built in only 90 days, using national materials for manufacturing it. The Justicialista line included a sedan, the chatita (small pickup), van, and a sport coupe. They were sold at low prices, with a total of 3,730 units produced. After General Per√≥n was deposed by the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora in 1955, the Justicialista was rebranded as Graciela by the Military Government.Historia de Graciela W on Autos de Culto website The sport version was cancelled while the sedan and small pickup lasted until 1957. = Rastrojero = Rastrojero (here the pickup version) was the most successful model by IAME, with more than 60,000 units produced The most successful model by IAME was the Rastrojero, a small utility pickup truck with 60,000 units produced. The Rastrojero was originally thought as a tractor to replace some cheap units imported from the United States (a total of 2,500 that had been purchased at a low price but were dismissed after a brief period due to multiple failures). After the US tractors were retired, Brigadier San Mart√≠n (president of IAME) took those tractors to use some of their components to create a new and improved model. The results were two vehicles, the Gauchita ‚Äìa prototype similar to the Station Wagon by American manufacturer Willys‚Äì and a pickup (then named \\"Rastrojero\\"). Developed in 1955, the Gauchita was powered with a D4M18 Borgward diesel engine.Justicialista - prototipos on Coche ArgentinoC√≥mo un tractor inservible se convirti√≥ en leyenda on El Litoral, 24 Oct 2009 The Rastrojero had a chassis similar to the 1937 Ford with a body similar to the Turismo Carretera cars of the time. The load was built in wood, to optimize costs and time. The prototypes were released in May 1952, with a huge success so the initial limited production of 2,500 \\"tractors\\" became production series. In 1955 the Rastrojero was powered with a diesel engine by Borgward.

The Pampa was developed to provide agricultural machinery to satisfy the needs of local farmers. The project to manufacture tractors in Argentina stated in June 1952, with the idea of a vehicle that could be operated easily.Estudios sobre la Industria Argentina, published by Lenguaje ClaroPampa, el tractor peronista, La Naci√≥n The original idea for the development of an Argentine tractor was to use German Lanz Bulldog D 9506 tractor (produced by Heinrich Lanz AG) as inspiration. The D9506 was a simple vehicle that could be fueled with different combustibles such as gasoil, kerosene, raw oil, animal grease and even parafine. Two D9506 units were brought from Uruguay to analize their mechanism and components, nevertheless and due to the date stipulated by Per√≥n to release a prototype (90 days) was about to be reached, the development of a fully-manufactured tractor was dismissed. Instead, IAME used the tractors built in Germany with slight modifications on their fronts, releasing them as \\"new\\" products. The first prototype was finished in October 1952, and two months later, 15 Pampa tractors were tested in agricultural works. The local subsidiary of Fiat gave assistance for the manufacture of the vehicle through some cooperation agreements.Tractor Pampa on Pesados Argentinos, 3 Mar 2014 The Pampa tractor was produced in Estaci√≥n Ferreyra, C√≥rdoba Province, with the first models released to public (12 units) in 1954, offered at m$n85,000, lower than similar products by those times. A total of 3,760 were produced from 1953 to 1963, when the Government sold the factory to private company Perkins. = Puma = Puma forth series Manufactured in the plant of C√≥rdoba, devolopment of this motorcycle started in June 1952,Puma: La moto del pueblo on Gente de Moto with the purpose of manufacturing a simple and effective vehicle. In May 1953 the factory is established near Villa Carlos Paz in C√≥rdoba Province, with the first prototype being launched months later, inspired on a German G√∂ricke model that had been given to Per√≥n as a gift. The Puma was equiped with a Sachs engine and kick pedal. Due to its low price and good performance, the motorcycle was well received, encouraging IAME to produce more models. The second series was launched in 1956, with 56,928 units sold. The fourth series (no \\"third\\" series were released) came in 1959, with changes in its design. That series (consisting of two different models) sold 36,755 units, while the fifth (and last) generation was launched in 1963, with 1,936 motorcycles sold. The Puma had a total of five series, with the last two being the most popular among users. In general, the Puma was mostly used by low and mid classes, being regarded as a reliable product at an affordable prize. In 1966 the factory was closed, so the production ceased. At the time of the closure, IAME had sold a total of 105,675 Puma motorcycles.Puma, la celebraci√≥n de una moto ic√≥nica by Javier Ferreyra on La Voz, 27 May 2019 = Other = Production also included boating with tourism boats, fishing boats, a portable boat, the sailing school Tero (sailboat), a Canadian canoe and an outboard motor Surub√≠.

He was originally a commander of Arab irregular soldiers, known as the Hawwara tribe, in the service of the Ottoman governors of Acre. His influence in the Galilee grew as he strengthened his alliances with the powerful Beni Sakhr and Anizzah tribes of Transjordan, and recruited unemployed Bedouin irregulars from Egypt into his own band of irregulars, who thenceforth became known as the Hanadi tribe. He was known by his men and Western travelers to be courageous, cunning and charismatic, all qualities that contributed to his rise as the de facto ruler of Galilee.Van Der Steen, \\"Case Study 1: Akila Agha\\". Throughout his rule, Aqil remained at least nominally in service to the Ottoman Empire, which paid him for protecting the roads of northern Palestine from Bedouin raids and for maintaining the security of this region. He also exacted his own tolls on the local population in return for ensuring their security. His friendly ties with the European governments were partially due to his protection of the local Christian and Jewish communities in Galilee, including his protection of Nazareth from the 1860 massacres that occurred in Ottoman Syria. Aqil's relationship with the authorities was generally tense and he rebelled directly or indirectly against their local representatives. As a consequence of this frayed relationship, Aqil's employment would frequently be terminated when his activities or influence perturbed the authorities and then reinstated when his services were needed. By the time of his death, his influence had declined significantly. He was buried in his Galilee stronghold of I'billin. While Palestine had been under Ottoman rule from the early 16th century, direct imperial administrative rule was challenged by a series of local leaders who exhibited vast influence over local affairs between the 17th and 19th centuries. With the Empire embroiled in the Crimean War, the power vacuum created in the area in the wake of Zahir al-Umar's rule in the Galilee (1730‚Äì1775), Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar's rule (1776‚Äì1804), and Muhammad Ali's rule (1831‚Äì1840), was filled by Aqil.Sch√∂lch, 1984, pp. 459‚Äì462. Aqil's demise represented the end of the last local obstacle to Ottoman centralization in Palestine. Early life and family Besides anecdotes provided in the writings of European consuls, most of the information on Aqil's life indirectly traces back to a history of the man written by Mikha'il Qa'war, a Nazareth clergyman. Aqil was born into a Bedouin family,Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 199. known later as the Hanadi tribe. The actual Hanadi were an unrelated tribe that came to Palestine from Egypt during Egyptian rule in Palestine (1831‚Äì1840) and around 1840 joined Aqil's Hawwara tribesmen, who also had migrated from Egypt. The name \\"Hanadi\\" translates in Arabic as \\"Indians\\" and the Hanadi irregulars were referred to as such by the inhabitants of Palestine because of their dark skin.Finn 1878, p. 414. Aqil's Hawwara tribesmen in Galilee were not related to the well-known Hawwara tribe of Upper Egypt, who were noted for their \\"bravery, horsemanship, and equipments\\" according to the Palestine Exploration Fund.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. 222 The Hawwara of Galilee were actually from the Ainawiyeh tribe of the Lower Egyptian desert region who had entered the service of Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar while the latter was based in Egypt in the late 18th century. They came with al-Jazzar to northern Palestine when al-Jazzar became the powerful Acre-based Ottoman governor of Sidon after the death of the Arab strongman of Galilee, Zahir al- Umar, in 1776. Al-Jazzar honored the Ainawiyeh tribesmen by giving them the name \\"Hawwara\\" to associate them with the famed Hawwara of Upper Egypt. Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, himself a commander of Hawwara irregulars in the service of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 462. He was not directly related to the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige. Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya).Abujaber, 1989, p. 35. Likewise, James Finn, the British consul in Jerusalem (1846‚Äì1863), claims Aqil's family was of Algerian or North African origin. Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a Turkmen woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area. According to historian Adel Manna, Aqil was born in Gaza.Mattar, 2005, p. 347. Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, pp. 222-223. Musa died in Gaza in 1830. Aqil's power base consisted of his tribesmen and alliances with other Bedouin tribes, who inhabited both sides of the Jordan River. Aqil's brother, Salih Agha, held substantial influence in the Haifa region. Mary Rogers, the sister of the English vice consul, described in detail a banquet in Shefa-'Amr and a gazelle hunt at the invitation of Salih Agha,Rogers, 1865, p.196 ff.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 201, note 576 while another traveler witnessed the lavish wedding between a son of Salih Agha and a daughter of Aqil Agha on \\"the plains of I'billin\\", in circa 1857.Farley, 1858, p.317 ff. Aqil married off another of his daughters to a Bedouin sheikh (chieftain) in Gaza, paying the highest dowry registered at the time in Gaza: 11,000 piasters.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 206. The governor of Hebron was reported to be a brother-in-law of Aqil.Saulcy, de 1872, Vol. 1, p.159 Strongman of Galilee=Consolidation of influence Like his father before him, Aqil served various masters, among whom was Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Aqil defected from Ibrahim Pasha's army and joined local rebels in the 1834 peasants' revolt against Egyptian conscription and disarmament measures, leading his Hawwara irregulars in the Galilee. At some point during the revolt, Aqil helped save the mostly Druze village of Isfiya from being destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's troops after its inhabitants paid Aqil for protection.Trisdam, 1865, p. 112. As the revolt was suppressed, Aqil and his men left Palestine for Transjordan, where they sought the protection of that region's major Bedouin tribes. During his time in Transjordan he strengthened relations with these tribes.Manna, ed. Mattar, 2005, p. 199. When the Ottomans regained control of Palestine in 1840‚Äì1841, Aqil returned to the Lower Galilee and was commissioned as a captain of ten mounted irregulars.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. 287 He recruited Egyptian irregulars from the Hanadi tribe and others who were left unemployed following the Egyptian withdrawal. Together with Aqil's Hawwara, they became a formidable local force. In 1843, Aqil became the chief of irregulars, known as bashi-bazouk, in northern Palestine,Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 462. and his command was expanded to fifty horsemen. Aqil's irregulars became known in the area as the Hanadi, although the group's tribal composition was mixed. Aqil angered the kaimakam (district governor) of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his intervention in a dispute between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth. One of the leaders of the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe. Aqil secured a durable alliance with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas on both sides of the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 463. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security. In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a protection racket. Encounter with William F. Lynch William F. Lynch In 1848, Aqil assisted an expedition headed by US Navy captain William Francis Lynch to the Dead Sea, and became known in the United States and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length in the works of Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the divan of Said Bey, the Ottoman kaimakam of Acre, and is recorded as follows: > But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage > enveloped in a scarlet cloth pelisse richly embroidered with gold. He was > the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever > seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his > hair a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and > the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. > With the tarboosh upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he > reclined, rather than sat upon the opposite side of the div√¢n, while his > hand played in unconscious familiarity with the hilt of his yataghan. He > looked like one who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with > the fair.'Lynch, 1849, p. 127Finn 1878, p.415. In this meeting, Said Bey had attempted to dissuade Lynch of his plans to travel to the Dead Sea, with Aqil remarking that the Bedouin of the Ghor (Jordan Valley) would \\"eat them up\\". Lynch's reply was that \\"they would find us difficult of digestion,\\" but he suggested that as Aqil seemed to hold influence with these tribes, he would be prepared to pay him to make the trip a more peaceable one. After the meeting ended, Lynch pursued Aqil to speak with him alone. He showed him his sword and revolver, which Aqil examined and declared to be the \\"Devil's invention\\". Lynch described the weaponry at the disposal of his men and asked Aqil if he thought it sufficient to make the journey to the Jordan, and Aqil replied that, \\"You will, if anyone can.\\" Lynch later secured Aqil's accompaniment on the trip to the Dead Sea, through the intervention of an ex-Sharif of Mecca, describing the latter as \\"our counsellor, sagacious and prudent,\\" and Aqil as, \\"the bold warrior and the admirable scout.\\"Finn 1878, pp. 416‚Äì418.Lynch, 1850, p.130 Aqil and his Beni Sakhr allies quashed a party of 'Adwan Bedouin tribesmen when they attempted to rob Lynch's party. Lynch's record of Aqil's feat made him well known in Europe. Hauran rebellion, imprisonment and escape Aqil's irregulars attracted the membership of local individuals and small clans. Along with his alliance with the two powerful tribes of the region, the Beni Sakhr and the Anizzah, Aqil's autonomy in the Galilee was further strengthened, although he was nominally subordinate to the Ottoman authorities. He based himself in the Zaydani fortress of I'billin, a mixed Muslim-Christian village between Acre and Nazareth that was previously fortified by the family of Zahir al-Umar. By 1852, Aqil ceased residing in I'billin, preferring the traditional Bedouin lifestyle, dwelling in encampments and among his livestock. At this point, he ruled the area between Shefa-'Amr to Baysan. He and his Hanadi tribesmen characteristically dressed in brown-striped robes. In 1852, he was commissioned by the Ottoman authorities to prevent the spread of a Druze rebellion from Hauran to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. 288. Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a supply route which the Ottomans used to send ammunition to their troops in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully. Despite his successes during the Druze revolt, the authorities, with whom he always had a tense relationship, grew wary of his strength and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there he was sent to serve a prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling. Reinstatement and Battle of Hattin The Horns of Hattin where Aqil and his men decisively defeated a Kurdish force seeking to oust him from Galilee in 1857 At the time of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the Crimean War with the Russian Empire, which left a domestic security void in its provinces due to the large number of provincial troops deployed to Crimea. To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855. On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to serve with the Ottoman Army in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from Karak. In Aqil's absence, a garrison of Kurdish irregulars based in Damascus had been left in charge of security in the Galilee. They were commanded by Shamdin Agha, but their employment was terminated by Aqil in 1855. Meanwhile, scores of Bedouin tribesmen from Faiyum with kinship ties to Aqil's tribal irregulars had migrated to the Levant as a result of their suppression by Sa'id Pasha of Egypt. Aqil welcomed their membership into his tribal band and their numbers subsequently swelled. He consecrated his relationship with the new arrivals by marrying a daughter of one of their sheikhs. In May 1856, he defeated the Abd al-Hadi clan of Arraba in a major clash that ended encroachments by the Abd al-Hadis on Aqil's territory.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 466. In 1857, the Beirut-based governor of Sidon Eyalet agreed to Shamdin's request to eliminate Aqil, who, to the consternation of the Ottoman authorities, was ruling the Galilee autonomously by that time. Shamdin, who sought vengeance against Aqil for terminating his service in Galilee, had complained to the Sidon governor that Aqil was committing treachery by collaborating with the Bedouin tribes against Ottoman authority. The Ottomans, whose dependence on Aqil had decreased with the end of the Crimean War in 1856, found in Shamdin's request a convenient way to end Aqil's growing autonomy. When Aqil visited Beirut to pay his respects to the governor of Sidon, he traveled with \\"the air of a sultan\\", according to the American missionary Henry H. Jessup, bringing with him a large and heavily armed Bedouin entourage.Jessup, 1910, pp. 273‚Äì274. Shamdin's forces, amounting to 600‚Äì700 Kurdish irregulars, massed in Tiberias.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. 289. They were commanded by Shamdin's sons Muhammad Sa'id and Hasan Agha. Curious at this deployment, Aqil had requested an explanation from the kaimakam of Acre, but received no response. Thus Aqil concluded that the deployment was part of a conspiracy to upend his rule. In response, Aqil assembled his entire force of irregulars, amounting to some 300‚Äì400 men, and marched towards Shamdin's troops. Other Arab tribes volunteered their service, but Aqil declined their participation. On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the Horns of Hattin, near the village of Hattin. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern weaponry at the Ottoman military's disposal.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 470. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle. Aqil's victory entrenched his rule over Galilee and afterward he established stronger relations with the Europeans. After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced themselves from the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations with a grain of salt. In September 1858, Aqil was residing in Nazareth and decided not to intervene and put a stop to tribal clashes in the Jezreel Valley. 1860 events and protection of Christians Drawing of Nazareth, 1839 by David Roberts, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Aqil was honored by various European governments for protecting the Christians of Nazareth from the 1860 massacres Aqil had been previously courted by European powers to secure protection for their Christian and Jewish prot√©g√©s.Finn 1878, p. 421 During the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, anti-Christian animosity spread to Damascus where Christians were massacred by Druze and Muslim mobs. It appeared that the violence would spread to Acre as well, but Aqil issued direct orders to Acre's Muslim residents not to bring harm to the city's Christians, stating he would \\"chastise ... with his sword\\" anyone who violated the orders. Aqil also protected the Christian community of Nazareth from harm as their coreligionists elsewhere in Ottoman Syria faced massacres. Part of this protection included warnings to local Bedouin tribes to refrain from assaulting the town and warnings to its Christian and Muslim residents to prepare themselves militarily in case of attack. Aqil maintained a close friendship with Tannous Qawwar, a prominent Greek Orthodox resident of the town.Mansour, 2004, p. 262 In gratitude for protecting the Christians in Nazareth and Acre, Napoleon III of France presented Aqil a gun and the Legion of Honor medal in April 1861 aboard his French vessel docked at Haifa Bay.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 468. Edward, Prince of Wales (later King of the United Kingdom) personally visited Aqil two years later to show his appreciation. Aqil offered Edward four Arabian horses, but Edward politely declined. As a token of his appreciation, Edward gave Aqil a revolver. His protection of the local Christians and his reputed Algerian origins drew comparisons with Abd al-Qader al-Jaza'iri, the exiled Algerian rebel who saved many Christians from harm during the 1860 riots in Damascus, and with whom Aqil developed ties.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 471. Aqil realized that European protection would strengthen his position towards the Ottoman rulers. After 1860, he courted the French, once sending a tiger as a present to \\"his Emperor\\" through the French consul in Beirut.Thomson, 1861, p.444 According to Finn, Aqil was under special \\"French consideration\\".Sch√∂lch, 1993, p.201Finn 1878, p. 425 Decline of influence The Ottoman imperial government adopted its Tanzimat modernization reforms in 1862 and originally entrusted Aqil with enforcing the new law of the land in northern Palestine. Part of these measures were stronger efforts to suppress the Bedouin tribes and decisively end their raiding activities. Aqil was given orders to prevent them from setting up camps in the cultivated lands of Galilee and forbade the collection of khuwwa tolls from the local inhabitants. Aqil resigned from his post when he was informed that as part of his new assignment he and his men were required to don Ottoman uniforms. He objected to the requirement, insisting that as Bedouin, they were not accustomed to wearing uniforms. He was replaced by one of his Hawwara tribesmen, but Aqil compelled his successor to resign as well. Shortly after his resignation, the requirement of uniforms was canceled and Aqil resumed his assignment. Aqil's closeness with the Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His relations with the kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 49. The Tanzimat proved unpopular with large segments of the population and a Bedouin revolt broke out, with Transjordanian tribes launching raids against Tiberias and its countryside in the summer of 1863. Aqil was unable to stop the raids, and may have played a role in the revolt. In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha would back down and reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation. After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in the region of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a daughter of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. 291 Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa. Kapuli Pasha's successor, Kurshid Pasha, resumed the anti-Bedouin operations in Galilee in 1864 and sought to establish in the eastern Galilee four heavily armed forts as a bulwark against further raiding. Aqil entered into a conflict with the governor of Nablus and member of the Abd al-Hadi family, who tried to arrest Aqil. Kurshid Pasha dismissed Aqil by the end of the year. Fearing his arrest or death in light of the Ottomans' subsequent deployment of 200 Kurdish irregulars to Tiberias and the presence of military forces from Acre and Beirut in western Galilee, Aqil fled to Salt in the Balqa area of Transjordan. Aqil later moved to Egypt. Abd al- Qadir al-Jaza'iri and Isma'il Pasha lobbied the Ottoman government on Aqil's behalf and he was given permission to return to Galilee in 1866. He subsequently inhabited the area of Mount Tabor. Despite his return and the reinstatement of a government salary, he was not able to restore his semi- autonomous authority in the region. In late 1869 he was awarded a medal of honor from the Habsburg dynasty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Death and legacy Zaydani fortress in I'billin. Aqil temporarily lived in I'billin, and the village served as his rural headquarters. He was buried there in 1870. Aqil died in 1870, although his death was erroneously recorded by R. A. Stewart Macalister to have occurred in 1867. According to Macalister, Aqil died in the vicinity of Shefa-'Amr. He was buried in I'billin, his previous Galilee headquarters. As of the early 1980s, descendants of Aqil still inhabited I'billin.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 464. Aqil's son Quwaytin succeeded him as the chief of the Hanadi tribesmen who continued to inhabit the Galilee and its vicinity. In the late 19th century, Quwaytin's tribe had some 900 members and was based in the northern Jordan Valley. Quwaytin donned the honor cross medallions given to his father by various European governments.Shumacher, 1889, p. 86. However, Hanadi influence and strength in the region diminished under Quwaytin and was gradually suppressed by various Ottoman actors, eventually reducing the Hanadi to an ineffectual tribe. Quwaytin's son and successor Rida also entered into Ottoman service and held the title of agha like Aqil.Abujaber, 1989, p. 36 In the early 20th century, Rida Agha held the equivalent rank of a lieutenant and served as commander of police in the Balqa Sanjak in Transjordan.Abujaber, 1989, p. 268. For nearly two decades Aqil had been a major local power in northern Palestine.Sch√∂lch, 1993, pp. 207‚Äì208 He asserted to other tribal sheikhs that the land they roamed in belonged to the Arabs and that one day they would take it back from the Turkish Ottoman \\"conquerors\\".Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 465. According to Finn, Aqil may have ultimately envisioned forming an Arab confederation in the southern Levant independent of the Ottomans and backed by France. However, despite these perceived intentions, Aqil ruled under the auspices of the Ottoman authorities, was paid by them, and was at least partially dependent upon their support. His ties with France and Europe contributed to his power, but he lacked the necessary support from these countries to pursue any desire of independence that he had.Sch√∂lch, 1984, pp. 472‚Äì473. Aqil's death marked the removal of \\"the last obstacle to the implementation of full centralized Ottoman rule\\" in northern Palestine, according to historian Mahmoud Yazbak.Yazbak, 1998, p. 3 When full Ottoman centralization in the Galilee was realized, local powers permanently lost their influence over the region's development. That power was instead passed on to wealthy businessmen from Haifa and Beirut, ultimately leaving the Sursock family of Beirut as the new \\"masters\\" of the Galilee, according to anthropologist Alexander Sch√∂lch. One of the factors Sch√∂lch attributes to Aqil's failure to secure an autonomous rule similar to that of the Arab sheikh Zahir al-Umar was Aqil's refusal to accept a sedentary life.Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 472. While I'billin frequently functioned as a headquarters of sorts for Aqil, he did not take up permanent residence there, or anywhere. Instead it served as a symbol of his authority in the Galilee. Aqil was adamantly a Bedouin and once remarked to William Lynch that it would be a \\"disgrace\\" to \\"till the ground like a fellah\\". The nomadic, marauding lifestyle of Aqil ran counter to the modernization efforts of the Ottomans, which strongly encouraged settlement of the land and centralization. These processes were eventually embraced by the peasantry and the urban notables, but resisted by the Bedouin tribes whose traditional livelihoods were at risk. Sch√∂lch asserts that Aqil contributed little to the socio-economic development of Palestine, and was not a \\"benefactor of the peasants\\".Sch√∂lch, 1984, p. 473. However, Aqil is described in a mostly positive light by modern-day sources and in local tradition. In the Arab nationalist political atmosphere that followed the Ottoman Empire's fall in 1917, Aqil's Arab identity and his struggles against the Ottomans contributed to the prevailing positive commemoration of his life. Palestinian Christians in particular remember him fondly for protecting Christians during his rule.

Tas-Silƒ° is a major multi-period sanctuary site with archaeological remains covering four thousand years, from the neolithic to the ninth century AD. The site includes a megalithic temple complex dating from the early third millennium BC, to a Phoenician and Punic sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Astarte. During the Roman era, the site became an international religious complex dedicated to the goddess Juno, helped by its location along major maritime trading routes, with the site being mentioned by first-century BC orator Cicero. The original name of the hill where the site is found is Ta' Berikka, with the name Tas-Silƒ° deriving from a nearby Church of Our Lady of the Snows (Maltese: Knisja tal- Madonna tas-Silƒ°), built in the 1800s. Excavated as part of an archaeological project in the 1960s, the site was abandoned for several decades. In 1996, the University of Malta restarted excavations, uncovering Neolithic and Late Bronze Age remains, and substantial deposits associated with ritual offerings in the Punic era.  Topography and toponymy  The nearby Church of Our Lady of the Snows, from which Tas-Silƒ° takes its name. Tas-Silƒ° is found in the south-eastern part of the island of Malta, close to the harbour of Marsaxlokk. In reality the name refers to a small church dedicated to Our Lady of the Snows, which is found at the crossroads where the country road from ≈ªejtun forks out in two directions, to Delimara peninsula and Xrobb il-Gƒßaƒ°in to the south-east and to the village of Marsaxlokk to the south-west. Fort Tas-Silƒ°, a British-era polygonal fort, stands at the highest point of an elongated hill further south. The lower and smaller hill on which the excavations have been conducted is called Ta' Berikka, although the tradition of calling it Tas-Silƒ° is now well established. The site commands views of the Marsaxlokk harbour to the south and overlooks two other bays, Marsascala and St Thomas' Bay. The site is surrounded by man-made terraced fields. The archaeological remains of Tas-Silƒ° rest on a hilltop overlooking, and visible from Marsaxlokk Bay and St Thomas' Bay in south-east Malta. Archaeological remains prove activity by humans for millennia, with significant activity happening during the Phoenician and Roman eras. Over the past centuries, the Tas-Silƒ° remains were debated by various scholars, however archaeological studies carried out by the Missione Archeologica ltaliana in the 1960s linked the remains with the renowned temple of Juno mentioned by classical authors. The remains remained visible ever since the classical era, and were described by antiquarians and travellers since the Early Modern period. The archaeological remains sprawl over two large areas to the north and south of the ≈ªejtun to Marsaxlokk road (Triq Xrobb l-Gƒßaƒ°in). Fields in both areas were selected for investigation by the Missione Archeologica ltaliana. These were excavated between 1963 and 1970. Archaeological excavations were also resumed in the 1990s in both the northern and southern enclosures of the site.  History =Megalithic Temple and Bronze Age settlement The excavations of an Italian Archaeological Mission at Tas-Silƒ° in 1963-72 were designed to investigate the remains of the Punic and later temples identified on the site. However, during the excavations, archaeologists unexpectedly found a prehistoric site beneath the Ancient and Late antiquity levels. The area was first inhabited when a temple was built in the Tarxien phase of Maltese prehistory, sometime around 3000 to 2500 BC. Few remains from the original temple can be seen, but the scatter of megaliths over the hill suggests that there was a large complex with at least 3 temples and possibly a village surrounding it. A D-shaped setting of large blocks that was part of the four-apsed temple still exists as it was later incorporated into the other buildings on the site. In the Bronze Age, the temple was probably converted into a settlement, as had been done in other sites such as Borƒ° in-Nadur. In the deepest layer of deposits, archaeologists found various artifacts including pottery, lithics, and a standing fat lady. From the Bronze Age layer, some sherds, stone tools and pottery were found. Other evidence from the Bronze Age consists of the large amount of handiwork. Punic, Hellenistic and Roman temple After the Phoenicians took over Malta in around 700 BC, they built a Punic temple to Astarte incorporating upstanding remains of the earlier temple. A forward extension was added to the curved facade, and a monumental doorway flanked with two pilasters and topped by a huge stone slab was built. The sanctuary's importance eventually grew and a portico was added around 300 BC. Some parts of the temple, including a tower, might have been designed as a fortification to help defend it from possible invaders. Megalithic remains at Tas-Silƒ°.A threshold slab pierced by three libation holes that divided the eastern part of the temple and the western side, as well as a series of ashlar foundation walls for a platform built to the south of the main sanctuary still exist. Around this area, various remains were found including pottery, ash, animal bones, coins and shreds. Some of these shreds have votive inscriptions. It is claimed that the Cippi of Melqart might have originally been at the Tas-Silƒ° temple, but their origin is disputed. The presence of significant remains of pottery on the site found during the excavations suggests the existence of workshops nearby which produced ceramic ware intended to be used within the temple site. However, the presence of imported ware was also confirmed by the make-up of the pottery. Numerous Punic bronze coins were also found on site. In the Roman era, the Punic temple was converted into a sanctuary of Juno, which was the Roman equivalent to Astarte. In 70 BC, Cicero mentioned the temple in his In Verrem, in which he said that the temple was revered by everyone including pirates and Numidian princes, but the Roman Governor of Sicily had stolen some of its treasures. Some Roman material was discovered in various deposits around a well in the lower terrace of Tas-Silƒ°. Red Roman flooring, opus signinam, made from crushed pottery, lime and white marble tiles, still exists on site. Opus signinum with white marble cubes at Tas- Silƒ°. Large water storage areas under Tas-Silƒ° were recently found and mapped, and they probably date to the Punic or Roman eras. = Ancient Egyptian influences = During the 1969 excavations, many stone reliefs and objects with Egyptian influences were found on site, including sculptures of lotus flowers representing the Egyptian goddess Hathor and the sun god. Within the sanctuary remains, an ornament with palm volutes measuring around 7.6 cm and dating to the 7th - 6th century BC was also uncovered. Other limestone fragments, theorised to belong to some architectural design, were also found in the same area. Other similar elements were found in the Roman house at Rabat, and they are theorised to have formed part of a thymiaterion, due to their Egyptian funerary design. Byzantine church Remains of the Byzantine basilica at Tas-Silƒ°. During the Byzantine era, the temple was converted into a Christian basilica. The basilica was built in the porticoed courtyard of the temple, which was roofed over. The square building had three naves with an apse at the eastern end. The prehistoric megalithic temple was reused as a baptistery, with the font placed in the middle of the ancient structure. The church, or at least its structure, remained in use until the 8th-9th centuries. A fortified wall with at least one tower was built around part of the site, possibly as a response to the Arab threat. More than two hundred Byzantine coins were found in the drain of the baptismal font, dating from the mid-4th century, the reforms by Justinian (538-9) and a gold coin dated to Constantine IV. The basilica at Tas-Silƒ° was expanded, modified and reutilised to include a fortified settlement linked with Marsaxlokk harbour below. Ceramic remains from Tas-Silƒ° span from the sixth to the ninth century, evidence that the harbour and settlement had links over centuries with various parts of the Mediterranean. Some remains of sculpture were found, including a worn female marble head and an ivory capital with a hanging palmette. Pottery from this period was also found, including amphorae and locally made plates and other items. During the Byzantine period, it may be that the fat lady was deliberately defaced and buried in a hollow. In the 8th century, defensive walls were hastily built around the church. The church was abandoned soon after the Arabs occupied Malta in 870 AD. The site was turned into a quarry and stones from the original structure were removed. In the medieval period farms were built on the area, and rubble walls from this era still exist. The whole site was buried under a metre of soil before being excavated. There are claims that a mosque stood on site but not enough archeological proof is found to support this. It is proven, however, that the Christian building was burned down during the Arab period.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/41623/1/L-arkeologija_u_l- identita_nazzjonali_1989.pdf Early Modern history Tas-Silƒ° may only be visited by prior appointment. In the 17th century writers began to speculate the location of Juno's temple that was referred to in ancient texts, however the site was only discovered in the 20th century. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. A remain of a column from the temple at Tas-Silg, built in the Phoenician period, is today found at the 17th century Palazzo Marnisi in Marsaxlokk.Bonello, Vincenzo (1964).

The removal of the farmhouse's floors uncovered further important archaeological remains, including a succession of floors and walls, which mostly linked with extensions built in the Republican period. The new discoveries also identified a number of spoliation trenches. These were dug in modern times to exploit the building material of the ancient temple.  Archaeological remains  Fluted column remains at Tas-Silƒ°. An Italian Mission led the first excavations in between 1963 and 1972 and identified the sanctuary. From 1996 to 2005 the University of Malta and an Italian team started another excavation project to clean other layers of sediments. The site is shielded by a cover to protect it from further erosion. Heritage Malta runs the conservation of Tas-Silƒ°, although the site is closed to the public, it may be visited by groups on appointment. Efforts to conserve the site are ongoing, with curators hoping that the road bisecting the site in two will someday be re-routed.

History The foundation stone was laid on 24 January 1884 by Mrs. Henry Wright of Heath House, Hampstead, widow of the late Revd. Henry Wright. At the service which followed the laying of the stone, the preacher was the Dean of Ripon, Very Revd. William Fremantle. It was built to designs by the local architect Watson Fothergill. The nave was completed at a cost of ¬£5,000 () and consecrated on 27 January 1885 by the Bishop of Southwell, Right Revd. George Ridding. It was constructed of Coxbench stone and the interior was lined with red brick. The columns were made of Darley Dale and Gorse Hill stone in alternate courses. The contractor was Smith and Lunn of Newark, the ironwork was made by Mr. Hodgkinson of Coventry, and the heating apparatus was installed by Haden and Sons of Trowbridge, Wiltshire. There were 600 free seats, and a parish of 6,000. It was situated on Woodborough Road. The patrons of the church were an Evangelical charity known as Hyndman's Trustees, who gave ¬£2,000 to the building fund. The chancel and organ chamber were added in 1892-93 and consecrated by the Bishop of Southwell on 17 March 1893. It comprised a high dado of glazed Minton tiles, continued as a reredos over the altar, with ecclesiastical symbols executed in encaustic work. The new chancel was designed by Watson Fothergill and built by the contractor Enoch Kent of Nottingham. In the early 1970s it merged with St. Ann's Church, Nottingham and a new parish of St. Ann with Emmanuel, Nottingham was formed. IncumbentsOrgan The earlier church organ was given to Lady Bay church in 1903. A new 3 manual organ by Compton and Musson was installed in 1903.

It was owned by the BenRiach Distillery Company Ltd. The distillery was founded in 1826 by James Allardes (referred to often as Allardice) as the second distillery to apply for a licence to legally produce whisky under the Excise Act of 1823, which passed three years earlier and which allowed for the distilling of Whisky in Scotland. Other sources credit a consortium of farmers and businessmen for the foundation of the distillery though this could include Allardes. The Glendronach distillery was purchased by Teachers and Sons Ltd around 1960 who increased the number of stills from two to six. In 1996 the distillery was mothballed and reopened again in 2002 by Allied Distillers Limited. In 2006 the distillery passed into the hands of Chivas Brothers Ltd (part of the Pernod Ricard group) and in 2008 it was sold to the BenRiach Distillery Company. Other notable owners include Walter Scott, who acquired it in 1881 and Charles Grant, son of the founder of the Glenfiddich distillery, in 1920. The distillery draws its water from the Dronac burn within the distillery grounds. It has its own floor maltings and two wash stills in addition to two spirit stills. The distillery is protected as a category B listed building. In April 2016 Glendronach Distillery was purchased by the Brown-Forman Corporation.

The Escanjaques may have been identical with the Aguacane who lived along the tributaries of the Red River in western Oklahoma. If so, they were probably related to the people later known as the Wichita. Juan de Onate Juan de Onate, governor and founder of the newly created Spanish province of New Mexico, led a Spanish expedition to the Great Plains in 1601. He followed the route taken by an unauthorized expedition in 1595, by Francisco Leyva de Bonilla and Antonio Gutierrez de Humana. An Indian named Jusepe Gutierrez, from Culiacan, Mexico, guided Onate. Jusepe was a survivor of the Leyva and Humana expedition.Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito. Don Juan de Onate, Colonizer of New Mexico, 1595-1628, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1953, Vol. V, p. 416-419 Accompanied by Jusepe, more than seventy Spanish soldiers and priests, an unknown number of Indian soldiers and servants, and seven hundred horses and mules, Onate journeyed across the plains eastward from New Mexico. Departing June 23, he followed the Canadian River through the Texas panhandle into Oklahoma. Turning away from the Canadian, he journeyed cross-country in a northerly direction. The land became greener, with more water and groves of walnut and oak trees. Description of the Escanjaques Near a small river, Onate found a large encampment of people he called Escanjaques. He estimated the population at more than 5,000 living in 600 houses. The Escanjaques lived in round houses as large as ninety feet in diameter and covered with tanned buffalo hides‚Äîsimilar in form to the grass houses of Quivira. \\"They were not a people who sowed or reaped, but they lived solely on the cattle [bison]. They were ruled by chiefs....[but] they obeyed their chiefs but little. They had large quantities of hides which, wrapped around their bodies, served them as clothing, but the weather being hot, all the men went about nearly naked, the women being clothed from the waist down. Men and women alike used bows and arrows, with which they were very dexterous.\\"Bolton, Herbert Eugene, Ed. Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1542-1706. Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing, 2007 (reprint), p. 257-258 The Escanjaques led Onate to a large settlement of their enemies, the Rayados, about 30 miles away. The Rayados abandoned their settlement and Onate restrained with difficulty the Escanjaques from looting it. He sent them back to their own settlement. However, when Onate returned to the Escanjaque settlement the next day, the Indians had turned unfriendly and he estimated that 1,500 men attacked him. Onate fought a two-hour battle with them before retiring from the field and beginning his return to New Mexico. Onate said that several Spaniards were wounded in the battle and claimed that a large number of Indians were killed. A cause of the battle may have been that Onate kidnapped several women and children from the Escanjaques.Forbes, Jack D. Apache, Navaho, and Spaniard. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994, p. 101-102 Onate released ‚Äî or was forced to release ‚Äî several of the women but he \\"took some boys upon the request of the religious, in order to instruct them in the matters of our holy Catholic faith.\\" One of those kidnapped was named Miguel, a captive of the Escanjaques himself from a land he called Tancoa, possibly the Tonkawa of North Texas and Oklahoma. Miguel would later provide information for the first map of the region.Bolton, p. 264 The identity of the Escanjaques Some authorities have identified the Escanjaques as Apache, but Onate's account would seem to distinguish them from the Apache who were by this time well known to the Spanish.Hickerson, Nancy Parrott, The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1994, p. 71-72. They have also been identified as the Kaw, although not persuasively as the Kaw are not known to be on the Great Plains in 1601. It is possible that \\"Escanjaques\\" was not the name of the Indians, but rather a greeting . On meeting Onate, they extended their hands toward the sun and returned it to their breasts saying \\"escanjaque.\\" \\"Breth, Ronald W. \\"Kansa Cultural Traits and History\\". December 3, 2008. Wichita State University. Later, Miguel told the Spaniards that the Escanjaques were, in reality, a people called the Aguacane. His information enabled the Spanish to draw a map of the region in which the Aguacane seemed to be located in southwestern Oklahoma along the Red River and its tributaries. If so, it is likely the Escanjaques (Aguacane) were speakers of a Caddoan language and probably akin to the Wichita.Vehik, Susan C. \\"Onate's Expedition to the Southern Plains: Routes, Destinations, and Implications for Later Prehistorical Adaptations,\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 31, No. 111, 1986, p. 13-33. Given their geographic location, the Aguacane might also be identical or related to the people called Teyas by Francisco V√°squez de Coronado sixty years before Onate. There are a few more references in the 16th century to the Escanjaques. It has been suggested that their descendants were the Iscani, a Wichita tribe of the eighteenth century. Where was the Escanjaque settlement? The Escanjaque settlement Onate found was probably a temporary camp. Its size, 600 tents and 5,000 people, precludes if from being a hunting camp. Perhaps the camp was large because the Escanjaques intended to go to war with the Rayados, or possibly it was formed to trade with the Rayados for Florence-A chert, a flint favored for arrowheads over much of Oklahoma and Kansas.Vehik, p. 29 The site of the Escanjaque settlement has not been found and the geographical details in Onate's account of his journey do not permit a location to be determined with certainty. Two possible locations are suggested: the Ninnescah River about 20 miles south of the present site of Wichita, Kansas or the Salt Fork River near Tonkawa, Oklahoma. Archaeological data best supports the Tonkawa site. An extensive archaeological site at Arkansas City, Kansas is believed by many to be the site of the Rayado village. Extrapolating backwards a location near Tonkawa for the Escanjaque settlement fits with Onate's account.Vehik, p. 14-21, Bolton, p. 205 See also * Quivira Notes Category:Caddoan peoples Category:Kay County, Oklahoma Category:Native American tribes in Oklahoma Category:Plains tribes ","title":"Escanjaque Indians"},{"id":"26575605","text":"The Rastrojero Conosur was a car designed from the second generation utilitarian Rastrojero Diesel.

The experiment used significant amounts of a short- lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by a team led by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi. The tests were performed with 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) spheres of radioactive lanthanum, equal to about and later , located in the center of a simulated nuclear device. The explosive lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests. Some 254 tests were conducted between September 1944 and March 1962. In his history of the Los Alamos project, David Hawkins wrote: ‚ÄúRaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design‚Äù. Experimental setup Experimental setup for RaLa shot 78 on May 13, 1947, at Bayo Canyon. Each rectangular box contains eight cylindrical fast alt=A sphere in a cyclider in the ground, above which is wooden scaffolding and two large boxes. In the background are trees. The experiment was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The idea was to measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma ray source was located in the center of a metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment. The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, and they would be fully absorbed in the surrounding metal; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements. Lanthanum-140 was chosen because it emits gamma rays in the desired energy range (1.60 megaelectronvolts (MeV), with fraction of 0.49 MeV), and has very high specific activity, thus providing sufficient radiation intensity to produce usable signals from the ionization chambers. After a test, dispersed La-140 rapidly decays into stable cerium-140, reducing the radiation hazard for the operators after several half-lives. It was also potentially available in larger quantities because its parent nuclide barium-140 is an abundant fission product of uranium. As a consequence, lanthanum-140 samples contained traces of barium-140, caesium-140, and especially strontium-90, which still presents a radioactive contamination problem in the area of the tests. Lanthanum-140 has a specific activity of 5.57√ó105 Ci/g (20.6 PBq/g); a La-140 source therefore equals about 1.8 mg of lanthanum. A radiolanthanum sample, precipitated in a tip of a small cone, followed by a plug, was lowered into the center of the metal sphere of the experimental assembly with a device resembling a fishing rod. The cone and the plug were mated to the metal center of the assembly, together forming a metal sphere. A section of the explosive lensing was then returned to its place above the sphere. Several, typically four, ionization chambers were located around the experimental setup. Immediately after the detonation they generated signals that were displayed on oscilloscopes in a blast-proof shelter or a mobile laboratory in a tank, away, and the oscilloscope traces recorded on cameras. A calibration measurement was performed before and after each test. The ionization chambers and their preamplifiers were destroyed during the explosion, but their simple design allowed their production in sufficient quantities. The ionization chambers were cylindrical, in diameter, long, with a wire along the longitudinal axis. They were filled with a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide at . Eight chambers were arranged in a tray and connected in parallel; four trays were located in a tetrahedron around the experimental assembly, recording the gamma radiation around the sphere, sufficiently close to give a signal and sufficiently far away to not be destroyed by the blast before they could record the required information. The initiation of the explosives was initially performed by a multipoint Primacord system. The results were erratic, as the detonations weren't sufficiently synchronized. Much better results were obtained after February 1945, when exploding- bridgewire detonators, developed by Luis Alvarez's G-7 group, became available. As plutonium was not available, it was substituted with material with similar mechanical properties. Depleted uranium was used but was not optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or cadmium were other choices. Cadmium was the choice for most of the tests. The first shot was performed with an iron mockup of the plutonium pit. The resulting signal was a fast dip, corresponding to the compression of the cadmium sphere, followed by slower increase, corresponding to the decompression and following dispersal of the sphere and the lanthanum. The differences between the four traces on the oscilloscope display, each indicating the average compression in the direction of the detector, allowed the assessment of the required synchronization accuracy for the detonators. The RaLa sources were highly radioactive. They had to be lowered to the test apparatus by a long rod. The tests were initially observed from a sealed M4 Sherman tank; the mobile laboratory consisted of two tanks. Each experiment was expected to contaminate an area of about for about half a year. When radiobarium was removed from the radiolanthanum, the short-term contamination levels turned out to be insignificant. Tanks were then replaced with fixed shelters. One of the tanks was later lead-plated, sealed, equipped with self-contained air supply, and used for sampling of fission products in the post-blast debris after the Trinity test. The sources posed a considerable radiation exposure risk; the exposure rate of a source at was 1,130 R/h and 11,000 R/h at . Sources with activities up to were used in some tests. Radiation safety The system for remote handling of the samples had flaws; it took about six months to discover them all. The chemists, who operated on mixtures of fission products with batches reaching up to each, were frequently exposed (accidentally) to undesirably high doses of radiation. The group handling the experiments themselves was less at risk; they operated in close coordination with the Health Group, who was in charge of ensuring that radiation exposure of the people involved was survivable. The radioactive contamination posed a problem. The people working in the Bayo Canyon had to change their clothes and take showers after the work. Sometimes they would still trip detectors at security gates. alt=A shack surrounded by pine trees. There is snow on the ground. A man and a woman in white lab coats are pulling on a rope, which is attached to a small trolley on a wooden platform. On top of the trolley is a large cylindrical object. The experiments were performed in the Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA-10 (\\"Technical Area 10\\") (but more commonly referred to as the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos townsite. The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing the explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15). Large amounts of radioactive lanthanum were dispersed by the outdoor explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed when the wind blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10 mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while. Each test released a plume of dispersed radioactive lanthanum. Three tests in 1950 are documented where the released radioactivity was tracked by a B-17 aircraft. In one case radiation was detected over a town downwind. These tests were concurrent with the RaLa tests, and their aim was development of airborne detectors for tracking air burst nuclear tests. The size and altitude of the radioactive cloud was determined by the quantity of the explosive used. For the first 125 tests between 1944 and 1949, meteorology and fallout monitoring were rare, but between 1950-1954 closer monitoring was phased in, and was comprehensive afterwards. One cloud was reportedly tracked as far as downwind, over Watrous, New Mexico. Logistics and schedule To handle the logistics of the tests, Luis Alvarez was appointed by Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos laboratory, as the head of the RaLa program; his group was designated E-7, RaLa and Electric Detonators Group. Bruno Rossi and Swiss physicist Hans Staub built the ionization chambers and electronics by late spring. At first the work proceeded at a leisurely pace as the implosion was only a backup project; it was believed that the plutonium bomb would be of the Thin Man gun- type fission weapon design. This turned out not to be the case, as the first tests on reactor-produced plutonium in early summer 1944 showed unacceptably high spontaneous fission rates due to the presence of plutonium-240, precluding the use of gun assembly. On 17 July the Thin Man design was abandoned, and all effort was focused on implosion. To meet the challenge, the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized‚Äîthe X-Division (Explosive Division) and the G-Division (Gadget Division, or Weapon Physics Division) were formed. Rossi's group was assigned to G-Division as G-6, or RaLa Group; Alvarez's group was G-7, or Electric Detonator Group. On 25 July 1944 the first preliminary test was fired in the Bayo Canyon as a rehearsal, test of equipment, and measurement of collapse times and detonation and shock wave velocities. The program was delayed by about a month by late radiobarium shipments, as the test scheduled for 15 August was not conducted until mid- September. The first test with radiobarium was fired on 22 September. In late August and at the request of Rossi's group, the RaLa group was reformed under the leadership of Rossi, and Alvarez and his group took over the exploding bridgewire detonator research. At the suggestion of Robert Christy solid spheres instead of the originally intended hollow ones were chosen for the pit, in order to reduce the problems with jets and spalling. The first solid- sphere RaLa shot was performed in early December but the results were inconclusive. The shot from 14 December though, showed (in the words of Robert Bacher) \\"definite evidence of compression\\". The first tests using electric detonators and solid pits were performed on 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The electric detonators showed a significant improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these results, by the end of February the design of the Gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important. Radiolanthanum preparation=Barium-lanthanum preparation The half- life of La-140 is 40.224 hours; it undergoes beta decay to stable cerium-140. It was prepared from barium-140, a common fission product isolated from the spent fuel from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory X-10 Graphite Reactor, and later, after 1948, also from the Hanford Site plutonium-239 producing nuclear reactors. Barium was isolated in a purpose-built hot laboratory in Oak Ridge and shipped in a lead pig to Los Alamos, where it was used to extract lanthanum. The Oak Ridge laboratory was the first laboratory where remote manipulators were used for work with radioactive materials. The delivery was performed by a truck with a two-person crew, driving nonstop. At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were irradiated for 40 days, then left to cool down for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed. At first the barium isolation was performed in building 3026-C (706-C), where an existing laboratory was converted for this purpose in 5 months; the first run was finished in September 1944. The 3026-C was designed for work with sources between , but conditions forced it to be adapted to work with sources. Its capacity was insufficient as demand grew. In May 1945 a dedicated building 3026-D (706-D), adjacent to 3026-C and designed to process sources up to 1000 Ci, was completed. The first run in 3026-D was on 26 May 1945, the same day as the last run in the 3026-C facility. By March 1949, 31 shipments averaging over 2000 Ci each were produced there for Los Alamos. Demand continued to grow though; by July 1950 the production goal per shipment was , and by the early 1950s the requirements went up to . By 1954 the shipments went up to , and that year the AEC decided to build a new facility in Idaho National Laboratory for RaLa production. In October 1956, Oak Ridge completed their 68th and last RaLa run. In total, Oak Ridge processed over 30,000 uranium slugs and shipped over to Los Alamos. During preparation of RaLa volatile fission products were released. When dissolved, a batch of 50 slugs produced of xenon-133, of iodine-131 (high amounts, as the fuel had to be processed \\"fresh\\"), and a small amount of krypton-85. As few precautions were used for limiting the fission product releases, the RaLa production was a major contributor to radioactive contamination at Oak Ridge. The iodine emissions were an important factor in the decision to move the facility to Idaho. Later improvements allowed a reduction of iodine emissions to levels about 100 times lower. A serious accident with radioactivity release occurred in the 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After the dissolution of the third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels on the third floor of the building reached 100 roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100 mR/h by 7 am the next day. The highest exposure to a person was 1.25 R of hard radiation and 4.7 roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation. Lanthanum preparation After delivery of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that took a long time to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate. The process was improved again, to allow repeated separation of lanthanum from the barium solution, as the lanthanum built up. Initially, a phosphate process was used, where lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum phosphate. This was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed; lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then converted to a filterable precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride. The oxalate method had to be performed quickly, as the oxalate ion was susceptible to radiolysis and the lanthanum had the tendency to go back into solution. The oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices. The batches contained about of radiolanthanum, the highest radiation levels people had ever worked with at that time. Special tools had to be developed for remote handling of the hot materials. Lead bricks were used for shielding the sources. The radiation dose limit for the personnel was set to 500 mrem (5 mSv) per source preparation. Sometimes this limit was exceeded; once the received dose was 2 rem (20 mSv). The improved process that separated lanthanum from the barium chloride solution had the advantage that barium could be \\"milked\\" repeatedly, increasing radiolanthanum yield and allowing more experiments. The problems of radioactive contamination with barium-140, with its half-life of 12.5 days, were eliminated; the amount of contaminating strontium-90 was also significantly reduced. Use of purified lanthanum also allowed usage of a much smaller amount of material in the tests themselves. Semiautomatic equipment for \\"lanthanum milking\\" (the barium-140 isotope was nicknamed a \\"cow\\") was built in a sufficiently distant area, which avoided time-consuming construction of a heavily shielded building. Early on, the process hit a snag when impurities of iron and other metals, probably introduced from an irradiated shipping container, were found to impair the lanthanum phosphate precipitation by forming phosphate gels that clogged filters. This problem was solved with better shipping containers. A similar \\"milking\\" process is now used for preparation of technetium-99m, used in nuclear medicine, from a molybdenum-99 \\"cow\\" in technetium-99m generators. The separation process was performed in a dedicated facility in the Bayo Canyon, in the radiochemistry building, designated TA-10-1. The separated lanthanum was then shipped to the test site in a lead cask on the back of a truck. In 1951, the separation work was moved to TA-35. The tests were performed in a month-long series, as the barium source decayed and was periodically \\"milked\\" for lanthanum. Post-war progress The technology was improved, and by 1951 the four ionization chambers were replaced by twenty scintillation counters, each using five gallons of a liquid scintillator. The flashes from of burning scintillator were remarkably brilliant in the early morning times when the tests were usually performed. RaLa tests continued until 1962, after which they were replaced by more advanced methods. Currently several other methods are used for hydrodynamic testing. Long-term contamination Lanthanum-140 has a short half-life of some 41 hours, and is not a threat after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut in various parts of the Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects, and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighboring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.

Only a few weeks later, on 9 February 1846, the second section was completed to a temporary terminus at the site of present-day Duisburg Hauptbahnhof called the Cologne-Minden railway station, the first of three train stations built at the same place. The route of the next section to Oberhausen, Altenessen, Gelsenkirchen, Wanne, Herne and Dortmund to Hamm was chosen over a route close to the coal mines that were then located on the north bank of the Ruhr because it was cheaper to build as it largely avoided hills. Nevertheless, it still took well over a year until 15 May 1847 for this section to be completed and put into operation. On 15 October 1847 the last section was opened to Minden, thus completing the entire 263 kilometre long, single track railway. On the same day the Royal Hanoverian State Railways opened its Hanover-Minden Railway, completing a connection to Berlin and northeastern Germany. Development  The railway line between Dortmund and Hamm has been continually modernized since its opening reflecting its growing importance as an east-west link. It is now at least double track and was electrified in the late 1950s over its entire length. In 1986, a 20.1 kilometre long section between Nordb√∂gge (near Hamm) and Dortmund was cleared for scheduled operations at 200 km/h. Since the beginning of the 1990s, trains have been permitted to operate in this section over its remaining level crossings at more than 160 km. Meanwhile, some of the crossings have been replaced by over or underpasses. Between the 120.4 and 143.4 km marks, the German train protection system, Linienzugbeeinflussung has been installed. Services  There are hourly Intercity-Express train services on ICE line 10 from Cologne via Duisburg, Essen, Hannover to Berlin and other InterCity or ICE trains run on the line. Regional-Express trains run at hourly intervals on four lines: RE 1: NRW-Express (Hamm‚ÄìAachen, half starting or finishing in Paderborn), RE 3: Rhein-Emscher-Express (Hamm‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf), and RE 6: Rhein- Weser-Express (Minden‚ÄìHamm‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf) and RE 11: Rhein-Hellweg-Express (Hamm‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach). RE 6 trains only stop at Kamen and RE 11 trains only stop at Kamen and Kamen-Methler between Hamm and Dortmund.

It was built by Germany next to the town of the same name in the early 20th century after the annexation of the Moselle following the Franco- Prussian War. The Fort de Koenigsmacker was part of the Moselstellung, a group of eleven fortresses surrounding Thionville and Metz to guard against the possibility of a French attack aimed at regaining Alsace and Lorraine, with construction taking place between 1908 and 1914. The fortification system incorporated new principles of defensive construction to deal with advances in artillery. Later forts, such as Koenigsmacker, embodied innovative design concepts such as dispersal and concealment. These later forts were designed to support offensive operations, as an anchor for a pivoting move by German forces into France. The Feste Koenigsmacker, as Fort de Koenigsmacker was called by the Germans, with Fort de Guentrange and Fort d'Illange, assured the protection of Thionville against French attack. Positioned to the rear of the principal lines of combat in the First World War, the fort never saw combat in that war, but posed a significant obstacle to advancing American forces in World War II. Description The Fort de Koenigsmacker is located about to the northeast of Thionville on a hilltop overlooking the salient formed by the Cattenom forest and the northern crossings of the Moselle. It was defended by a garrison of 1180 men. Like the Fort d'Illange, Koenigsmacker features an armored battery, originally armed with four short 100mm guns in single turrets. Four separate fortified barracks housed troops, with underground galleries connected the battery, barracks, and infantry positions. A ditch, defended by a counterscarp and three caponiers, is located on the south and east sides. The dispersed, un-walled nature of the later Moselstellung was a significant innovation. Compared to the French S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system forts of the same era, later German fortifications such as Koenigsmacker were scattered over a large area and enclosed chiefly by barbed wire. While certain individual elements presented imposing walls to an attacker, these walls were not continuous. The dispersed nature is evidenced by the official French name: the Groupe Fortifi√© de Koenigsmacker (Fortified Group of Koenigsmacker). These arrangements were studied and improved upon by the French in the construction of the Maginot Line. Koenigsmacker's fairly compact arrangement includes four dispersed fortified barracks built into a hillside so that their rears are shielded by earth, while the tops and fronts are protected by three or four meters of concrete, and are surmounted by parapets. The south barracks was constructed as an infantry shelter, or abri, with no living accommodations. The single battery is similarly constructed and linked to the barracks by tunnels. The four 100mm guns in the battery were protected by Schumann turrets and controlled by an armored observation cupola on top of the western barracks. The whole was surrounded by deep networks of barbed wire, which were swept by fire from small perimeter blockhouses, also linked via the tunnel system. The interior of the position was equipped with trenches for infantry. The barracks and batteries were further armored with reinforced concrete and armored windows. A variety of blockhouses and infantry shelters were also built in the intervals between forts. the tunnels total in length. Two additional armored batteries were planned for the hill to the northeast of the fort, but were never built. The barracks were provided with central heat, while a central utility plant generated electricity using five 40 hp diesel engines. Operational concept From 1899, the Germans viewed Metz as a secure position that could provide an anchor for a pivoting movement into France from the Low Countries. This strategy, which would become known as the Schlieffen Plan, required that the Moselstellung deter an advance by French forces into Lorraine while the German forces mobilized. History Franco- German border, 1914 Begun in 1908, Koenigsmacker was incomplete at the outbreak of war in 1914. It saw no action during World War I, as Thionville remained well within German lines for the duration of the war. With the Compi√®gne armistice of 1918, Lorraine was returned to France and the fort became French property. The three Thionville forts became known as the Fortified Group of Thionville. :See Fortified Sector of Thionville for a broader discussion of the Thionville sector of the Maginot Line. The Fort de Koenigsmacker was integrated into the Fortified Sector of Thionville of the Maginot Line in the 1930s, serving as a sub-sector command post and backing up the newer Maginot ouvrages that were built about halfway between Thionville and the border with Luxembourg. The short 105mm guns were replaced by 105mm long guns removed from the German fortifications of Metz. The artillery range was thus increased from to . In 1940 Koenigsmacker was the command post for the 167th Fortress Infantry Regiment (RIF), which manned the nearby Maginot ouvrages. During the Battle of France the Thionville area was bypassed and encircled by German forces, with the Maginot and earlier fortifications seeing little action. Koenigsmacker overlooks the crossing of the Moselle at Cattenom. During the Lorraine Campaign of World War II, the U.S. 90th Infantry Division crossed the flooded Moselle early on 9 November 1944. Fire from Koenigsmacker destroyed bridging equipment and harassed boat-borne troops, but elements of the 358th Infantry Regiment established a lodgement on the east bank and infiltrated the area of the fort before daybreak. The initial American assault took the German garrison, manned by the 74th regiment of the 19th Volksgrenadier Division, by surprise, but German resistance quickly became more effective. American combat engineers took over the assault, using explosives to destroy or seal openings and ventilation shafts. The engineers used such a quantity of explosives that they ran out, and had to be replenished by an airdrop. The fort's 100mm guns could not be depressed to deal with the close-in attackers, but kept up fire on nearby U.S. formations. By nightfall the Americans had occupied a portion of the fort's surface. The next morning, Company C of the 358th attacked from the south, encountering a fortified ditch. Companies A and B meanwhile occupied the fort's surface and continued with attacks using demolition charges, while the fort kept up artillery fire on American units trying to pass by the fort. On the 11th much of the fort had been suppressed, but its guns continued to fire. A relief patrol of 145 Germans attempting to relieve the fort was ambushed and captured. On the 12th an assault by G Company of the 358th coincided with a decision by the German garrison to evacuate. Surrounded, the Germans surrendered. More than 300 Germans were captured or casualties, with 111 American casualties.Donnell, p. 53 After the war the site remained military property, but was not used. The fort is abandoned and partly stripped. Manning Under German occupation in 1944, Koenigsmacker was garrisoned by the 74th Volksgrenadier Regiment of the 19th Volksgrenadier Division. Present status A proposal has been made to clean up the site and make it accessible with paths and a parking area in the manner of the park at Fort d'Illange. The site remains dangerous and is not open to the public.Donnell, p. 60 ReferencesExternal links * Fort de Koenigsmacker at Les Amis du P√®re Scheil * Le Groupe Fortifi√© Koenigsmacker * The forts of Thionville * Plan of the Fort de Koenigsmacker Category:Fortifications of Thionville Category:Moselstellung Category:Maginot Line Category:Fortified Sector of Thionville ","title":"Fort de Koenigsmacker"},{"id":"26575728","text":"Shunz≈ç Sugimura(ÊùâÊùëÊò•‰∏â 1910-1994) wrote his lifework \\"leprosy and social welfare\\" through fieldwork.

She was reclassified as a corvette in 1852. She conducted important propulsion trials, finally proving the superiority of screw propulsion and served in West Africa, the Crimea, China, the East Indies and Australia.

Basilisk had started life as her sister ship when both were designed as sailing sloops, but while Niger received screw propulsion, Basilisk was fitted with paddles. Although previous trials, including a similar comparison between Rattler and Alecto in 1845, had shown that screw propulsion was broadly superior, the 1849 trials pitted two near-identical ships against each other. Since both ships had the same lines and steam engines developing almost identical power, the results confirmed the superiority of screw propulsion over the paddle-wheel once and for all. After the trials she formed part of the West Africa Squadron. She served in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War in 1854-1855.

Eplik was born in Rapla, Estonia, into a music-loving family. Eplik studied music at the Tallinn Music School, specialising in pop-jazz singing and also studied the guitar, which he now teaches. The British Council nominated Eplik for the International Young Music Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2008 in the following words: \\"Vaiko is a highly creative and engaging individual who is clearly passionate about music. He is obviously a highly influential figure in the Estonian industry. The judges appreciate his integrity and his thought- through artistic approach. He has defined his own business model that reflects his aspirations and expectations and that allows him to quietly champion a different approach.\\" He has been part of several collectives: Claire's Birthday, Ruffus and Koer. In 2006, Eplik started his solo project under the name Eliit. He has released eight albums, regularly reaching the top of Estonian album charts. In 2014, he released two albums in close sequence, \\"N√µgesed\\" (\\"Nettles\\") and \\"Nelgid\\" (\\"Carnations\\"). He has emphasised his aspiration to \\"earn enough money to get by, and keep being intelligent and free to be creative with music.\\" Eplik is a principled independent artist, producing his music at home and releasing it under his independent record label. In 2006 he commented on it in the following words:\\"Home-made music has no rival... From now on to in about five years time, record companies will be bankrupt.\\" He also co-wrote and produced the songs for the debut album of the Estonian singer Lenna Kuurmaa, Lenna, and recently composed music for the Estonian animation \\"Suur maalrit√∂√∂\\" (\\"The Great Painter\\"), based on the illustrations of Edgar Valter and released in 2013.

Lear started painting parrots in 1830 when he was 18 years old, and by 1832 he had published 42 paintings of parrots as lithographic plates bound together as a book. A total of 175 books were made of which about 100 survive today. He painted live parrots at the London Zoo and some in private collections. The quality of his paintings of parrots established his reputation as one of the best natural history artists of his time. The young Lear gained access to parrots in private collections through contacts he made while sketching at London Zoo. He met Benjamin Leadbeater, a taxidermist and trader in specimens, who is credited in the captions as possessing several of the birds depicted. Another primary source of specimens was the menagerie of Edward Smith Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby and then president of the Linnean Society (1828‚Äî1833). Lear met Stanley in 1831 and spent time studying the parrots amongst his large collection of animals. Noted as the pinnacle of his natural history productions, during the period before his eyesight began to fail, the illustrations are regarded as exquisitely accurate and appealing. The work was a forerunner to the major volumes of bird paintings by Gould and Audubon, who had both worked with Lear. Sketches and studies for this work are included in the major Lear art collection held at the Harvard University Houghton Library. The lithographic plates for Lear's publication were produced by Charles Joseph Hullmandel, a printer noted for his reproduction of fine art.

It was the Israeli song entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 where the Israeli entry finished 14th despite being one of the favorites. History \\"Milim\\" was selected to be the Israeli song entry for Eurovision after winning the Kdam Eurovision 2010 in March 2010, beating out three other finalists. The selection was decided by a combination of juries' and public votes. It received maximum points from all juries as well as the televotersIsrael in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 A special CD entitled \\"Eurovision 2010\\" was released by Skaat and contains all four songs featured in the KDAM. Both the CD and song are also available on iTunes (\\"Milim\\" is listed under the English title of \\"Words\\") Despite finishing in 14th place, Israel swept the Eurovision sanctioned Marcel Bezencon Awards. Adaddi and Horev won the Composer Award, while Skaat won the Artistic Award for best singer and Skaat and \\"Milim\\" won the Press Award for best entry. The awards are selected by participating composers, and accredited press and media, and commentators of the Eurovision contest. In contrast to the way most songs were presented at Eurovision, Israel opted for a simple presentation with Skaat in a black suit with Adaddi playing on a grand piano, and two backup singers to Skaat's left in the back of him. \\"Milim\\" has been described as a power ballad. The song shares similar qualities with some of Skaat's other songs, most notably his award-winning hit, \\"Veat\\". At the press conference after the second Eurovision rehearsal in Oslo, Adaddi said, \\"We didn't write the song for the Eurovision, as much as for Harel Skaat, who I think is an amazing singer and he interprets the song in a way that I don't know anybody else can do with such passion and also with a beautiful voice.\\" The song starts out quietly and builds throughout until it reaches a loud crescendo near the end of the song. In between the time the song was selected at the Kdam and the Eurovision contest, the Israeli team revised the song's vocal arrangement and re-recorded the song with a full philharmonic orchestra backing. Skaat released both a French and an English version of the song, as well as a music video.^ https://www.youtube.com/skaatharel The French lyrics are by former Eurovision winner, Anne Marie David It also has been reported that Skaat plans to record and release a Spanish version of the song, with the lyrics translated by Marta Gomez, who has previously worked with Idan Raichel. \\"Milim\\" was a hit on Israeli radio stations throughout the Spring of 2010 and spent a total of five weeks at number one on the Reshet Gimmel Chart, one of the major music charts in Israel, including that of the entire month of May 2010.http://www.charts.co.il/charts.asp?id=1 Retrieved 4 June 2010 In an interview prior to the Eurovision contest, Skaat explained what the song was about to him. He said, \\"The song 'Milim' is about separation of any kind. Separation of lovers, of a family. In Hebrew, 'Milim' means words. The words are the most memorable thing we have after a separation, words are very powerful and they are engraved in our minds and hearts. Sadly, my beloved grandfather suddenly passed away the week of the Israeli pre-selection competition, which gave the lyrics of 'Milim' a very personal and difficult meaning to me.\\" The song lyrics seem to suggest that the person singing the song has been left alone while his or her loved one has left, perhaps permanently.

The game was released, as a part of the PlayStation Portable Remaster series, on PlayStation 3. The game introduces new regions, monsters, and a revised Felyne combat system. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is not an update to Monster Hunter Freedom Unite or Monster Hunter Tri. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is instead separate to the rest of the series, and most of the game has been entirely remade. However, it is also a successor to Monster Hunter Freedom Unite as the third game in the Portable series. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD ver. is a high definition remastering of the game for the PlayStation 3, and is the first of Sony's \\"PSP Remasters\\" series for the PS3. The game was released in Japan on August 25, 2011 and features enhanced HD graphics, 3D support and shared save support with the PSP. Gameplay The new base of operations is Yukumo Village. This village has a feudal Japanese feel to it, both from its design to its residents. Now the Felynes train in the farm and have more training options like the marathon training in which the Felyne runs around the farm. The player can take two Felynes out with him/her on a single player quest, up from the single companion of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. When you take Felynes out on quests, monster attacks are divided between the player and the companions, making hunts easier. Also new to Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is the ability to customize the Felyne companions' equipment. Doing so will change the creature's physical appearance and properties. The player will be able to customize the Felynes in three areas: weapon, head parts and torso parts. A new field introduced in the game is . All the hunting fields in Monster Hunter Tri, along with the addition of the Mountain Stream field are included in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. Underwater quests, however, have been completely removed, therefore maps such as the Deserted Island and Flooded Forest have been revised to work around this. Not all monsters from Monster Hunter Tri are present in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd ‚Äì Lagiacrus, Gobul, and Ceadeus have been removed. Zinogre, the flagship monster of the game is shown on the cover art. The Guild Hall now features a hot spring, similar to the Felyne Kitchen from previous games, which can be upgraded by clearing special 'Hot Spring Quests' which upgrade the effects of the hot spring, as well as the Felyne Whim Skills, which can now be chosen and selected by the player. All weapon classes from previous games (Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword and Shield, Dual Blades, Hammer, Hunting Horn, Lance, Gunlance, Switch Axe, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun and Bow) are present in the game. The four classes which were not present in Tri (Dual blades, Hunting Horn, Gunlance and Bow) have been revised. The equipment creation and fortification systems received a variety of changes. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto claimed that this area of the game will keep what was good from Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Monster Hunter Tri and add new elements. Reception Famitsu gave the PSP version a score of two tens, one nine, and one ten, for an almost-perfect score of 39 out of 40. Sales The game was number one in the Japanese sales chart of 5 December 2010, replacing Gran Turismo 5. Within two weeks of release by December 20, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd sold 2.58 million units in Japan. According to the game's publisher, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd is \\"now the fastest selling PSP title ever in Japan\\" and \\"the fastest selling game in Capcom's history.\\" By June 2011, the game's sales in Japan had reached 4.8 million units; making it the third best-selling PSP game of all time.

During the Cultural Revolution, he was depicted as the archetype of the exploiter of peasant farmers. Biography Liu Wencai is considered one of the most colorful figures in the Sichuan province during the Republic of China (1912‚Äì49) period. He comes from a family of land owners and liquor merchants, and prospered under the patronage of influential family members in senior government positions. Liu had good relations with local politicians and military leaders, but was also said to have had connections with organized crime and secret societies. Under Liu, peasants were cheated in their lease so that they lived in a state of permanent debt. At the end of the lease, peasants are driven from their homes by Liu, with some being forced to sell their children, or recruited into the military. He died in 1949, shortly before the People's Liberation Army entered Sichuan. Reception Liu Wencai was portrayed the archetypal villain of feudal societies by communist party propaganda since the 1950s, with publications of his supposed deeds being distributed throughout the country. The authenticity of Liu's stories are questionable, and it is difficult to separate established facts with propaganda. Since Liu Wencai is still seen as a controversial figure in China today, there is little independent research on his life. Liu's grandson Liu Xiaofei has sought to rehabilitate his grandfather's image, as having contributed positively to the education and economic development of Sichuan, as well as having built key infrastructures in Dayi County Liu's reputation remained even after the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. In 1999, Sichuan author Xiao Shu wrote a book \\"The Truth on Liu Wencai\\" (Liu Wencai zhenxiang) which contained a more positive evaluation of Liu that deviated significantly from the official portrayal, and as a result was withdrawn from sale. In 2003, the Hong Kong television station Phoenix TV broadcast a similar portrayal of Liu, but the program has been censored in mainland China, although it remained available on the internet. Xiao Shu has since published a new, freely available book on Liu Wencai. In English, one article has been published which partially discusses the demonization of Liu Wencai's image by the Chinese government and how his grandson Liu Xiaofei tried to rehabilitate his grandfather's reputation. Museum The former residence of the Liu family in Dayi County was converted into a museum in 1958, and since 1980 has been listed as a historical site. It covers an area of 20,000 square meters, and houses an extensive collection of over 2,700 items, and more than 500 rooms. It houses the 1965 sculpture Rent Collection Courtyard, a work of socialist realism which depicted Liu as an evil landlord collecting rent from poor peasants. The Museum has been research as a site of collective memory, class education, and tourist memorabilia.

He was previously Deputy Director of Translational Research at Fox Chase Cancer Center, where he was also co-Leader of the Molecular Therapeutics Program. Career El-Deiry was formerly a Professor of Medicine and Chief of Hematology/Oncology at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. He also served as the Associate Director for Translational Research and Interim Cancer Center Director at Penn State University. Prior to his tenure at Penn State, he was an investigator in cell biology at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor of medicine, genetics, and pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. While at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. El-Deiry served as co-Leader of the Radiobiology & Imaging Program at the Abramson Cancer Center and as Associate Director for Physician-Scientist training in Hematology/Oncology. He held an endowed chair in hematology-oncology while at Penn State University: the Rose Dunlap Division Chair in Hematology-Oncology. At Fox Chase Cancer Center, he holds the William Wikoff Smith Chair in Cancer Research. El-Deiry earned MD and PhD degrees from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in 1987 and later delivered the Keynote presentation at the 9th Annual MD/PhD Student Research Symposium. Research El-Deiry is among the top 40 most-cited researchers of the 1990s, having authored 13 papers that have been cited over 6,000 times. His paper, \\"WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression\\", which has been cited over 9,000 times according to Google Scholar, is among the top 10 most-cited papers of the 1990s. El-Deiry discovered the genomic DNA binding site for the tumor suppressor p53. Nikola Pavletich later crystallized the DNA-binding domain of p53 with the DNA binding site and showed that p53 amino acid residues involved in mutations in human cancer normally touch the DNA binding site recognized by the p53 protein. El-Deiry made the discoveries of the consensus binding site for p53 and the discovery of WAF1 while working with Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University. p21(WAF1) was the first mammalian cell cycle inhibitor to be discovered, and was found independently by Wade Harper and Steve Elledge as a CDK2-interacting protein p21(CIP1), Yue Xiong and David Beach as a cyclin- CDK-PCNA interacting protein (p21), and as a senescence derived inhibitor by Noda. Multiple CDK inhibitors have become approved as cancer therapeutics, including palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib. In 2017, El-Deiry's group discovered a micro-RNA family that inhibits CDK4/6. In total, El-Deiry has >61,000 citations and an H-index of 114 according to Google Scholar. He was recognized through an award from the American Cancer Society in 2016. As an independent investigator at University of Pennsylvania, El-Deiry discovered TRAIL death receptor 5 (DR5) in 1997. His group was first to combine gene silencing with bioluminescence imaging in vivo and to use molecular imaging for drug screening. His group created a knockout mouse of death receptor 5 (DR5) that shows reduced apoptosis in vivo after exposure to gamma-radiation, and increased tumor susceptibility in tumor-prone genetic backgrounds. The mechanism by which cell death occurs in vivo after radiation or other DNA damage has remained an important question that has been studied by Michael B. Kastan, Scott W. Lowe, Karen Vousden, and others. El-Deiry's contribution was to define the role of the extrinsic cell death pathway through p53 regulation of death receptor 5. El-Deiry worked on drug synergies and discovered a potent cancer therapeutic interaction between TRAIL and sorafenib. In 2013, his group reported a TRAIL-inducing compound TIC10 as a novel cancer therapeutic and dual inhibitor of ERK and Akt. TIC10 (also known as ONC201) could cross the blood-brain barrier and treat glioblastoma brain cancer in mice. Glioblastoma is a difficult to treat cancer with a high mortality rate. ONC201 is being tested in the clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital and New York University with some evidence of response in patients with glioblastoma. By 2016, TIC10 was found to trigger an integrated stress response leading to anti-tumor effects. ONC201/TIC10 is active against cancer stem cells and blocks cancer stem cell gene signatures. ONC201 can bind a subtype of dopamine receptors. Unlike TRAIL which is active against a subset of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), ONC201 has preclinical anti-tumor efficacy against ER/PR+. Her2+ and TNBC. Analogues of ONC201, including ONC206 and ONC212 have been described and demonstrate some differential activities as compared to ONC201. ONC212 has preclinical activity in pancreatic cancer, liver cancer and melanoma. Professional activities As an American Cancer Society Research Professor, El-Deiry was introduced and spoke at a Relay for Life event in Pennsylvania in 2017. In 2001, El-Deiry became the Founding Editor-in-Chief of the peer- reviewed journal Cancer Biology and Therapy. El-Deiry is a member of the F1000 faculty. He serves as a Member of the Editorial Board of the oncology newspaper HemOnc Today. In 2005, El-Deiry became a member of the Interurban Clinical Club, and served as its President in 2013‚Äì2014. He is also a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (1999), the Association of American Physicians (2008), is a Fellow of the American College of Physicians (2012), and a member of the Johns Hopkins University Society of Scholars (2014). In June, 2015 El-Deiry described the developments in liquid biopsy for the American Association for Cancer Research's blog CancerResearch Catalyst. In August, 2015 El-Deiry gave an interview to Yahoo Lifestyle about former President Carter's melanoma that had spread to his brain. He also spoke with Health News Reporter Ali Gorman at Fox Chase in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 8-20-15 regarding President Jimmy Carter's Diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. In February, 2016 he spoke with US News and World Report about targeted cancer therapy for genetic discoveries. El-Deiry commented for the Washington Post in June, 2016 about the Cancer Moonshot spearheaded by then Vice President Joseph Biden, and organized an event in Philadelphia. El-Deiry advocated for broadening clinical trial enrollment criteria to be more inclusive. As a medical oncologist El-Deiry specializes in the care of patients with colorectal cancer. His clinical research demonstrated variability in 5-fluorouracil plasma levels in patients with colorectal cancer. El-Deiry showed that pharmacokinetically-guided dosing of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy is associated with lower levels of toxicity among patients with stage II/III as well as stage IV colorectal cancer. Toxicity from chemotherapy is associated with worse quality of life in patients with cancer. In 2017, his group showed that the tumor suppressor protein p53 represses the DPYD gene in 5-fluorouracil-treated cells and that tumor cells with mutated p53 have higher levels of DPYD thereby becoming resistant to 5-fluorouracil. DPYD is involved in the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil and patients with DPD-deficiency have predictable toxicity from 5-fluorouracil. El-Deiry advises adopting a healthy diet including cutting back on pro-inflammatory foods to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. He discusses in detail and endorses findings that tree nut consumption reduces the risk of recurrence and promotes improved survival in patients with stage III colon cancer. El-Deiry spoke about the benefits of tree nut consumption with a Philadelphia CBS local news station that shared the news. He further argues for the use of CEA as an inexpensive and useful blood-based marker to follow when possible to monitor colorectal cancer disease burden and progress after surgery or chemotherapy. He provides his perspective on the use of maintenance chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. El- Deiry is the scientific Founder of Oncoceutics. Personal life El-Deiry is a husband to wife Evelyn, and father to four kids James, John, Jennifer and Julie.

It differs from fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) in that it is frozen within 24 hours of blood collection, whereas FFP is frozen within 8 hours. The phrase \\"FFP\\" is sometimes used to refer to any frozen blood plasma product intended for transfusion. PF24 is stored, thawed, and infused with the same procedures used for FFP. Although it is technically a different product, most healthcare providers continue to refer to FFP when the actual component is PF24. History The production of PF24 began in response to an increase in reported cases of transfusion-related acute lung injury, or TRALI. The proposed mechanism of TRALI involves antibodies from donor blood components (predominantly plasma) that are directed against human leukocyte antigens (HLA).Transfusion-Related Lung Injury (TRALI). Karp, Julie Katz. NewsPath (College of American Pathologists online newsletter). Posted Jan. 1, 2010. These antibodies are most numerous in women who have been pregnant more than once. Thus, removing these women from the donor pool for frozen plasma was proposed as a solution to the TRALI problem (the women‚Äôs plasma could still be used for production of other components, including cryoprecipitate). However, removing roughly half of the donor pool was not a viable alternative, given the increasing need for plasma transfusion. The PF24 approach was pioneered in the United Kingdom beginning in 2004Mostly male plasma sends TRALI rates south. Paxton, A. CAP Today (lead article). College of American Pathologists. October 2009. and in the United States beginning in 2007.American Association of Blood Banks, Association Bulletin 06-07, November 2006. The use of PF24 has been accompanied by a decrease in the incidence of TRALI‚Äîa roughly 50% reduction in reported cases. Long-term studies on the effectiveness of PF24 in massive transfusion have not been conducted. This does not address the question of risk from plasma in other components, particularly apheresis platelets. Removing multiparous women from this limited donor pool would likely cause too great a shortage of platelets, resulting in more deaths (due to hemorrhage) than are seen due to TRALI after platelet infusion. PF24 has roughly 70% of the blood coagulation-factor activity of FFP. Given the fact that there is typically an overabundance of coagulation factors in normal plasma, the decrease noted in PF24 is not thought to be clinically significant. Production Much of the donor blood supply is obtained at \\"remote\\" blood donation events, such as blood drives at colleges, community events, etc., rather than at dedicated donation centers. The time required for transportation and processing often precludes production of FFP in such cases; that is the plasma cannot be separated and frozen within 8 hours of collection. However, the (male) donor blood can be separated into packed red blood cells and plasma within 24 hours (and usually less).
