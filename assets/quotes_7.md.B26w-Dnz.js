Her graphic novel Belonging: A German Reckons With History and Home won the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography, 2019 Schubart-Literaturpreis, and 2019 Evangelischer Buchpreis. She is also an Associate professor of Illustration at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. Early life and education Krug was born in 1977 in Karslruhe, Germany. Growing up, she attended a specialized middle and high school for classical music but chose to pursue a career in drawing at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. She returned to Europe briefly to study Visual Communication at Berlin University of the Arts but flew back to North America to earn her Master's of Fine Arts degree at the School of Visual Arts. While studying in New York, Krug said she began to feel ashamed of her home country because ‚Äúas soon as you answer someone who asks you where you are from, the association with the Nazi period is there. You are constantly being confronted with it.\\" Although she was confronted with negative stereotypes towards German cultural identity, she was simultaneously asked questions about her family history she had no knowledge of. Krug later recounted that she \\"felt a growing urge to tackle my country‚Äôs history in a new way. I realized that to overcome the collective, abstract shame I had grown into as a German two generations after the war, I needed to go back and ask questions about my family, my hometown.\\" Upon marrying into a Jewish family, she began to properly research and record her family's story during World War II. Career As an Associate professor of Illustration at the Parsons School of Design, Krug received a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship and 2014 Sendak Fellowship She also earned a gold medal from the Society of Illustrators for her book Shadow Atlas, an Encyclopedia of Ghosts. While approaching her late 30s, Krug returned to Germany to research archives and conduct interviews with her family members on their story during World War II. Krug said she was deeply disturbed to find Nazi propaganda in her uncle's grade school exercise books. Upon further investigation, she also found that her maternal grandfather Willi Rock was a driving instructor in Karlsruhe and became a member of the Nazi regime in 1933. Krug combined her knowledge and research into a graphic novel titled Belonging: A German Reckons with History and Home (German title: Heimat). She later stated she illustrated and wrote her graphic novel as a way to counteract the negative stereotypes she encountered in New York and educate the American public. Krug's graphic novel received the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award in Autobiography, 2019 Schubart-Literaturpreis, Evangelischer Buchpreis, Lynd Ward Graphic Novel Prize, Ludwig Marum Prize, Moira Gemmill Illustrator of the Year Award, and the British Book Design and Production Award for Graphic Novels.

During the era of the British Raj in India, the then president of the All-India Anglo-Indian Association represented the Anglo-Indian community of undivided India at the Round Table Conferences. At the time of the Indian independence movement, the All-India Anglo-Indian Association opposed the partition of India; its then president Frank Anthony \\"fought for the best interests of his community as Indians, not Britishers,\\" criticizing the British for \\"racial discrimination in matters of pay and allowances, and for failing to acknowledge the sterling military and civil contributions made by Anglo-Indians to the Raj\\". In September 1942, at the organisation's annual general meeting, the All India Anglo-Indian Association affirmed its love for and loyalty to India. The organisation's efforts under the presidency of Anthony led to Article 331 being included in the Constitution of India: \\"Notwithstanding anything in Article 170, the Governor of a State may, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community needs representation in the Legislative Assembly of the State and is not adequately represented therein, [nominate one member of that community to the Assembly].\\" The various branches of the All India Anglo-Indian Association arrange events throughout the year.

Biography  Mar√≠a Marcos Cedillo Salas was born in April 1910 in Rancho Palomas, in the Ciudad de Ma√≠z in the state of San Luis Potos√≠ to Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n Salas and Homobono Cedillo. Her paternal uncle was the politician and general Saturnino Cedillo, governor of the state of San Luis Potos√≠ from 1927 to 1931 through the Partido Nacional Revolucionario. Her father's family were involved in political and military activity around the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) and the Cristero War (1926 ‚Äì 1929), and several uncles and aunts were killed or imprisoned for their parts in the struggle. Details about her early life are sketchy, but family memories suggest she was adventurous and liked cars and planes.  Career as a pilot  Mar√≠a Marcos Cedillo Salas was inspired to become a pilot by the American Florence Lowe ‚ÄúPancho‚Äù Barnes, the first woman to pilot herself into the state of San Luis Potos√≠ in 1930. Maria Marcos Cedillo Salas joined the first Civil Aviation School in San Luis Potos√≠, founded by her uncle, governor Saturnino Cedillo. This was against the wishes of her relatives who considered it too dangerous. She was one of the earliest pupils. She owned a 549K biplane, designed by the leading aviation engineers in Mexico, Mexican Guillermo Villasana L√≥pez and Italian Francisco Santarini Tognoli who ran the Talleres Nacionales de Construcciones Aeron√°uticas, the national workshop for aeronautical construction. She named the plane \\"√Ångel del Infierno\\" (Angel of Hell) after her uncle Saturnino's description of planes as ‚Äúthose machines from hell‚Äù. He disliked aircraft, despite his having set up the aviation school. She personally painted the name on both sides of the plane. She was soon flying long distances on the established civilian air routes 7 and 8, between San Luis-Zacatecas-Torre√≥n and San Luis-Le√≥n- Guadalajara, respectively.  Death  On the morning of 6 June 1933, Mar√≠a Marcos took off in her plane accompanied by her student and mechanic, Jos√© Ram√≠rez, to perform aerial stunts. Within minutes, during the ‚ÄúBarrena‚Äù (spin) maneuver, her plane plummeted out of control and hit the Los Valentinos hill, killing both pilot and passenger. General Saturnino Cedillo later went to the scene and fired all the bullets from his pistol at the remains of the plane that he blamed for taking the life of his niece Mar√≠a, who he had cared for since the death of her father. Mar√≠a Marcos Cedillo Salas was laid to rest in the Pantheon of Saucito (Pante√≥n del Saucito). She is commemorated by a monument on the site where her plane crashed on Calle T√©cnica 144, in the University area. Members of her family gather at the monument every year on the 6th of June to remember her.

A member and previous leader of the Conservative Party, Duncan Smith was appointed to the Cabinet by Prime Minister David Cameron following the 2010 general election and the formation of the coalition government between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. He was reappointed after the Conservatives won a majority in the 2015 general election but resigned in March 2016 in opposition to disability benefit cuts. Under Duncan Smith, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) rolled out Universal Credit and a new Work Programme, as well as implemented a real terms cut in benefits and increased the number of benefit eligibility tests being carried out. During his time as Work and Pensions Secretary, the DWP was criticised for rises in food poverty and people being forced to use foodbanks and he himself was criticised for breaking the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.  Views  Outlining the scale of unemployment following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and previous Labour government, Duncan Smith said almost five million people were on unemployment benefits, 1.4 million of whom had been receiving support for nine or more of the last 10 years. In addition, 1.4 million under-25s were neither working nor in full-time education. He said; \\"This picture is set against a backdrop of 13 years of continuously increasing expenditure, which has outstripped inflation ... Worse than the growing expense though, is the fact that the money is not even making the impact we want it to ... A system that was originally designed to support the poorest in society is now trapping them in the very condition it was supposed to alleviate.\\"  Pension age  In June 2010, Duncan Smith said the government would encourage people to work for longer by making it illegal for companies to force staff to give up work at 65, and by bringing forward the planned rises in the age for claiming the state pension. Duncan Smith told The Daily Telegraph pension reforms were intended to \\"reinvigorate retirement\\". \\"People are living longer and healthier lives than ever, and the last thing we want is to lose their skills and experience from the workplace due to an arbitrary age limit,\\" he said. \\"Now is absolutely the right time to live up to our responsibility to reform our outdated pension system and to take action where the previous government failed to do so. If Britain is to have a stable, affordable pension system, people need to work longer, but we will reward their hard work with a decent state pension that will enable them to enjoy quality of life in their retirement.\\"  Universal Credit  In July 2010, Duncan Smith announced a far more radical series of reforms intended to simplify the benefits and tax credits scheme into a single payment to be known as Universal Credit. A major aim of welfare reform was to ensure that low earners would always be better off in employment. \\"After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair,\\" said Duncan Smith, citing examples of people under the existing system who would see very little incremental income from increasing their working hours due to withdrawal of other benefits. Outlining the scheme in more detail in November 2010, Duncan Smith promised \\"targeted work activity for those who need to get used to the habits of work\\" and sanctions, including the possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. He said welfare reform would benefit all those who \\"play by the rules\\" and ensure \\"work always pays more\\" by easing the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises.Duncan Smith unveils details of welfare 'contract' , BBC The next phase of welfare reform announced by Duncan Smith in late 2011 required benefits claimants with part-time incomes below a certain threshold to search for additional work or risk losing access to their benefits. \\"We are already requiring people on out of work benefits to do more to prepare for and look for work,\\" he said. \\"Now we are looking to change the rules for those who are in-work and claiming benefits, so that once they have overcome their barriers and got into work, in time they can reduce their dependency or come off benefits altogether.\\" He said that benefits were not a route out of child poverty but hundreds of thousands of children could be lifted out of child poverty if one of their parents were to work at least a 35-hour week at the national minimum wage. Duncan Smith argued a proposed ¬£26,000-a-year benefits cap would not lead to a rise in homelessness or child poverty. \\"The reality is that with ¬£26,000 a year, it‚Äôs very difficult to believe that families will be plunged into poverty ‚Äì children or adults,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"Capping at average earnings of ¬£35,000 before tax and ¬£26,000 after, actually means that we are going to work with families make sure that they will find a way out.\\" but added there would need to be \\"discretionary measures\\". Duncan Smith led the government's legislation in the House of Commons in January 2013 to cap most benefit increases at 1%, a real terms cut. In April 2013, he said he could live on ¬£53 per week as Work and Pensions Secretary, after a benefits claimant told the BBC he had ¬£53 per week after housing costs. In September 2013, Duncan Smith's department cancelled a week of \\"celebrations\\" to mark the impact of enhanced benefit sanctions. General secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) Mark Serwotka commented: \\"It is distasteful in the extreme and grossly offensive that the DWP would even consider talking about celebrating cutting people's benefits.\\" In the same month, the department was subject to an \\"excoriating\\" National Audit Office report, in which it was accused of having \\"weak management, ineffective control and poor governance; a fortress mentality, a \\"good news\\" reporting culture, a lack of transparency, inadequate financial control, and ineffective oversight\\" as well as wasting ¬£34 million on inadequate computer systems.\\"The moral certainty of Iain Duncan Smith\\", James Landale, BBC News, 5 September 2013 The Department for Work and Pensions had said that 1 million people would be placed on the new Universal Credit benefits system by April 2014, yet by October 2014 only 15,000 were assigned to UC. Duncan Smith said that a final delivery date would not be set for this, declaring \\"Arbitrary dates and deadlines are the enemy of secure delivery.\\" In 2014, it was reported that his department was employing debt collectors to retrieve overpaid benefits, the overpayment purely down to calculation mistakes by HMRC.  Work Programme  In June 2011, Duncan Smith announced earlier welfare-to-work programs would be replaced with a single Work Programme, which included incentives for private sector service providers to help the unemployed find long term employment. Further developments included the requirement for some long term recipients of Job Seekers Allowance to undertake unpaid full-time work placements with private companies. After the \\"workfare\\" element of this programmed was successfully challenged in the courts, Duncan Smith sought to re-establish the legality of the scheme through emergency and retrospective legislation. Legal experts were said to be \\"outraged\\" that the bill applied retrospectively, breaking a key standard of British law. In 2014, the High Court ruled the retrospective nature of the legislation interfered with the \\"right to a fair trial\\" under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Winter fuel payments  In April 2013, Duncan Smith called for wealthier people to voluntarily return winter fuel payments, given to all pensioners regardless of wealth, to help reduce the strain on public finances.Iain Duncan Smith calls for wealthy pensioners to hand back benefits , The Guardian, 28 April 2013, retrieved 30 April 2013 This suggestion prompted media comment, with some wealthier pensioners stating they had already tried to return their payments, for this same reason, but had this offer refused by the government because there was no mechanism in place to receive returned payments.Michele Hanson, I tried to hand back my winter fuel payment , The Guardian, 30 April 2013, retrieved 30 April 2013  Use of statistics  In July 2013, Duncan Smith was found by Andrew Dilnot, then Head of the UK Statistics Authority, to have broken their Code of Practice for Official Statistics for his and the DWP's use of figures in support of government policies. Dilnot also stated, following an earlier complaint about the handling of statistics by Duncan Smith's department, he had previously been told, \\"that senior DWP officials had reiterated to their staff the seriousness of their obligations under the Code of Practice and that departmental procedures would be reviewed\\". Duncan Smith's defended his department, saying: \\"You cannot absolutely prove those two things are connected ‚Äì you cannot disprove what I said. I believe this to be right.\\" This led Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, to accuse the Conservative Party of going beyond spin and the normal political practice of cherry picking of figures to the act of actually \\"making things up\\" with respect to the impact of government policy on employment and other matters. On World Food Day in October 2013, foodbank provider The Trussell Trust called for an inquiry to investigate the trebling in numbers of people using their foodbanks in the past year and the rise in UK hunger and food poverty which they described as reaching \\"scandalous levels\\". Oxfam commented: \\"These figures lay bare the shocking scale of destitution, hardship and hunger in the UK. It is completely unacceptable that in the seventh wealthiest nation on the planet, the number of people turning to foodbanks has tripled.\\" According to the BBC, the number of people given three days food by the Trussell Trust increased from 40,000 in 2009‚Äì10 to 913,000 by 2013‚Äì14. A letter signed by 27 bishops earlier in 2014 blamed \\"cutbacks and failures in the benefits system\\" for driving people to foodbanks.  Disability benefits policy  The Guardian reported Duncan Smith's department announced on the 2012 United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities forced work for disabled people who received welfare benefits, in order to \\"Improve disabled people's chances of getting work by mandatory employment\\". From this United Nations appointed day onwards, people with disabilities and illnesses ranging from cancer to paralysis to mental health would be forced by the UK government to work for free or else they could risk being stripped of up to 70% of their welfare benefits. In September 2013, leaked documents showed that Duncan Smith was looking at \\"how to make it harder for sick and disabled people to claim benefits\\". Duncan Smith was advised that it would be illegal to introduce secondary legislation, which does not require parliament's approval, in order to give job centre staff more powers to make those who were claiming Employment and Support Allowance undertake more tests to prove that they were making a serious effort to come off benefits and find a job. The powers being discussed also included \\"forcing sick and disabled people to take up offers of work.\\" DWP staff would also have the power to strip claimants with serious, but time-limited health conditions, of benefits if they refuse the offer of work. In June 2015, a judge ruled that there had been a \\"breach of duty on the part of the secretary of state to act without unreasonable delay in determination of the claimant's claims for PIP,\\" the replacement for Disability Living Allowance. One of the claimants, an ME sufferer with visual impairment was twice required to travel to attend an assessment, a request which the judge described as irrational. On 3 July 2015, a group of over \\"70 leading Catholics\\" wrote to Duncan Smith asking him to rewrite his policies to make them more in line with Catholic and Christian values. The writers stated that whilst they believed he wanted to improve lives, they believed his policies were having the opposite effect and they asked him to rethink and abandon further damaging cuts. In August 2015, he was criticised after the DWP admitted publishing fake testimonies of claimants enjoying their benefits cuts. Later the same month, publication of statistics showed 2,380 people died in a 3-year period shortly after a work capability assessment declared them fit for work leading Jeremy Corbyn to call for Duncan Smith's resignation. At his party's conference in October 2015, Duncan Smith said in a speech about the sick and disabled \\"we won't lift you out of poverty by simply transferring taxpayers' money to you.

It was the most important holding of the Amorite Yamutbal tribe.  Qarni-Lim  Qarni-Lim was the first known King of Andarig, who ruled from 1770-1766 B.C.E. He conquered Apum, and put his son Zuzu in charge of it, although Zuzu died shortly after falling off the city wall. After that, Qarni-Lim lost Apum to Elam. Qarni-Lim was initially an ally of Eshnunna but later sided with the Mariote King, Zimri-Lim. Who he later got into a feud with, resulting in a siege of the city. Andarig later voluntary become a vassal of the Assyrian King Shamshi-Adad, which lead to a revolution in the city resulting in the assassination of Qarni-Lim, who was beheaded in 1766.  Atamrum  Following the death of Qarni-Lim, troops from Eshnunna occupied Andarig and gave the throne to the populist leader Atamrum the son of Warad-Sim, king of Allahad. Andarig become independent under its new King who aligned himself with the Elamite King who had just launched a major offensive in Mesopotamia in 1765. Following this, Atamrum once again allied himself with Zimri-Lim who helped him take the city of Razama. Although any alliance with Mari ended when the kingdom was conquered by Hammurabi.  Himdiya  After Atamrum died, his son Himdiya succeeded him. He established an alliance with Hazi-Teshub, the King of Razama in opposition to a bloc formed by Mutiya and Shtamar-Adad the kings of Apum and Kurda respectively. Himdiya conquered Apum and ruled it for two years, however he was later defeated by Kurda, who incorporated Andrig into their kingdom.

The program airs live from Copenhagen's Central Station, with occasional segments recorded at Tivoli. It is currently hosted by Mikkel Kryger, Ida Wohlert, Adam Duv√• Hall, Louise Wolff, Steen Langeberg, and Puk Elg√•rd. The program's success has led to several spin-off news shows on the same channel, which are often presented by the same hosts. The spin-offs have included Go' Sommer Danmark, Go' Appetit, and Go' Aften Live (formerly Go' Aften Danmark).  History  Go' morgen Danmark first aired on December 2, 1996. It was originally hosted by an experienced news presenter, Michael Meyerheim, along with Cecilie Fr√∏kj√¶r, a young journalist student. Fr√∏kj√¶r was later awarded as female TV-host of the year in 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008 for her work by Tvprisen. In 1998 the program added two new hosts, S√∏ren Kaster and Synne Garff. The show has since maintained multiple regular hosts. In 1997, the program began being produced by the danish film studios in Lyngby. The studio, which had been staged as an apartment, was moved to the TV studios in Amager. By 2002, the show had again moved to Copenhagen Central Station and the program has aired from this location ever since. In 2009 the show was purchased by the studio Nordisk Film. Production and staff was largely changed by the new studio, though hosts Cecilie Fr√∏kj√¶r and Morten Resen were bought out of their contracts with Skandinavisk Film Kompagni.  Morning television in Denmark  Denmark's first morning television show, Morgenfilmer, aired from 1984 until 1991 on Kanal 2, a TV station in Copenhagen. A month before Go' morgen Danmark premiered, a similarly titled program named simply Go' morgen began airing on TV3. The program was produced by Nordisk Film, but was not as popular as the studio had hoped. The show was taken off the air in 1997. DR aired a morning show from 2001 to 2006 called DR Morgen, which focused on news programming. Since 2007, DR1 has aired Morgenh√•r along with cartoons to cater towards families with children.

Kill. Bluebeard. Imp. is a 2019 series of plays by British playwright Caryl Churchill that were premiered together.  Reception  After viewing the Royal Court Theatre premiere, Sam Marlowe of The Times lauded the plays as \\"crystalline in their grace and lucidity, audacious in their form. In these four short plays Churchill conjures the neurosis and fragility of our precarious modern lives and the patterns of behaviour and belief that govern them. [...] It‚Äôs all incredibly intricate, yet effortless, and James Macdonald‚Äôs impeccable production delivers it with playful vaudevillian swagger.\\" Aleks Sierz of The Arts Desk gave the performance four out of five stars and wrote, \\"Each of them is vividly distinct, being linguistically agile, theatrically pleasurable and emotionally dark\\". The critic argued that the \\"deeper point [of Kill] is that if the barbarity of ancient Greek revenge killings and brutal deities are at the heart of Western civilization then it's hardly surprising that today's murderous psychos can 'be so charming'.\\" Sierz called Bluebeard's Friends \\"gloriously gothic\\". David Benedict of The Stage awarded the performance a full five stars. Evening Standard's Jessie Thompson dubbed the plays \\"a thrilling reminder of why she‚Äôs our greatest living playwright. [...] Churchill spans everything from poetry to surrealism to tell four tales that feel both urgent to our current moment and like timeless, amber-cast fairytales.\\" The critic described Imp as \\"a poignant look at how our beliefs can comfort and trap us\\", and praised Bluebeard's Friends as \\"the most incisive dramatic study of our post-Weinstein mentality we‚Äôve yet to see\\". Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote, \\"The power of [Imp] lies in its suggestion that even a life of studied ordinariness conceals untold mysteries.\\" Billington argued that Bluebeard and Kill effectively make the point \\"that we are all haunted by a fascination with bloodshot fables\\", but described Glass as \\"somewhat opaque\\". In a five-star review of the premiere, Paul Taylor of The Independent lauded the \\"audacious, haunting and often horribly funny games the veteran dramatist is playing\\" in the series. Taylor wrote that \\"with remarkable stealth and economy, [Bluebeard's Friends] shows how a materialist, shameless culture allows this network of hangers-on to brazen out any tendencies to self-blame.\\" He also argued that with Imp, Churchill \\"creates a powerful sense of a fractured world where well-meaning people can turn in a trice against outsiders, and unnerved people fear everything\\". Andrzej Lukowski of Time Out wrote that while the work is lesser than Escaped Alone, \\"her almost supernatural powers of language remain entirely undimmed.\\" He described Bluebeard's Friends as the \\"most incisive\\" of the first three plays. However, Rosemary Waugh of New Statesman expressed disagreement with the praise of this third work as \\"the great #MeToo play we were all waiting for\\", saying that \\"Glass is by far the most intriguing thanks to how it resists interpretation [...] incredibly, piercingly sad at the end, despite the fact you‚Äôre still unsure about exactly what you‚Äôve just witnessed.\\" Susannah Clapp of The Observer argued, \\"Churchill‚Äôs elastic way with structure and the gauntlet of her ideas are so striking that there is a risk of overlooking just how comic a writer she is, and how powerful a creator of weird and credible dialogue. [...] There is a beautiful arc to the evening as the final line quietly touches on opening moments. It is a testament to these oblique, remarkable plays that a single word can provoke a murmur of recognition.\\" In Exeunt, Hannah Greenstreet said, \\"When I watched it, I found Glass frustratingly oblique and the conceit overstretched, but the writing rewards meditative, returning attention.\\" She argued that Imp \\"seems to suggest the power of the things we keep bottled up (desire, violence, a craving for companionship), but also expresses a note of hope in the possibility for relationships even in unlikely circumstances. [...] The combination of the four forms a kaleidoscopic meditation on the power of stories.\\" Conversely, Dominic Cavendish of The Telegraph gave the same performance three out of five stars, saying that Bluebeard and Imp are less compelling than the first two plays. The Spectator's Lloyd Evans criticized Kill and Bluebeard, writing, \\"The weakness of the script [for Bluebeard], as with sketch two, is that it‚Äôs a commentary on a drama rather than a drama itself.\\" He praised Imp, making a comparison to Alan Bennett and arguing that \\"these oddball characters are curiously engaging and full of realistic details.

He was allegedly arrested for not wearing a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. He died at a hospital with traumatic brain injury and with a gunshot wound to his leg. Public outcry over his death erupted one month later, due to a video of his arrest going viral on social media and inspired by the protests of the death of George Floyd in the United States. Protests against police brutality began in Jalisco on June 4, 2020, and have also spread to other areas in Mexico. The Attorney General of Jalisco has announced that three police officers from Ixtlahuac√°n de los Membrillos were arrested on June 5, 2020 for the murder of Giovanni L√≥pez. Giovanni L√≥pez Giovanni L√≥pez Ram√≠rez (1990-2020) was a thirty-year-old bricklayer who lived in Ixtlahuac√°n de los Membrillos. Arrest and death Giovanni's brother, Christian Daniel L√≥pez Ram√≠rez, recorded the moment when police arrested his brother on May 4, 2020. He was arrested in front of the L√≥pez family home, allegedly for not wearing a face mask. After his brother's arrest, Christian has stated that he and his neighbors called the mayor, who told them that they could pick up their brother the next day at approximately 10:00 a.m. The next day, on May 5, 2020, L√≥pez's family went to the municipal jail to get Giovanni, when they were told he was at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara. Giovanni's aunt has said that the police at the jail told her that Giovanni was at the hospital because \\"se les hab√≠a pasado la mano\\" (roughly meaning \\"they went heavy handed\\"), an expression in Spanish suggesting that the police had used excessive force. At the hospital, they were told that Giovanni had died of traumatic brain injury. He also had lesions and a gunshot wound to his left leg. Aftermath Giovanni's brother did not release the video of his brother's arrest until one month later. He has accused the mayor of Ixtlahuac√°n, Eduardo Cervantes Aguilar, of offering his family $200,000 pesos (approximately US$9,300) to not release the video of Giovanni's arrest and also claims that the mayor threatened to have his family killed if the video was released. The mayor has denied the accusations. In the following days of the arrest video being released, at least 28 people were detained for protesting. Reactions The governor of Jalisco, Enrique Alfaro Ram√≠rez, has stated that L√≥pez's arrest had nothing to do with a face mask. Mexican President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador has spoken about the incident, stating that he will \\"not interfere with the case to avoid partisan conflicts.\\" Mexican actress Salma Hayek posted a photograph on Instagram protesting against the murder of L√≥pez. Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro has also condemned the killing of Giovanni L√≥pez on social media. Other artists decrying the death of L√≥pez included the Mexican band Molotov and Mexican actress Zuria Vega. The Mexican branch of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has condemned L√≥pez's death and called for an independent investigation.

The Section 7 of the NVRA requires that publicly funded agencies which provide public assistance offer voter registration and related services with every core service in every way they offer their other core services GoVoteMiami supports their efforts to reach and maintain effective compliance with the 1993 NVRA. The list of agencies tasked under the NVRA is substantial and, to name some of them, includes all public libraries, all public agencies offering services to persons with disabilities, The Department of Children and Family Services, all Armed Forces, all branches of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Medicare. But also state or local government offices such as public schools, State colleges, universities and community colleges, city and county clerks offices, marriage license offices, fishing and hunting license offices, government revenue offices, and unemployment compensation offices. Additionally, GoVoteMiami works with local, state-wide and national non-profit organizations in supporting their efforts to create higher voter awareness and engagement by elevating the visibility of voter registration in many organizations. GoVoteMiami has been endorsed by City of Miami Mayor Francis Suarez  History  GoVoteMiami grew from a small volunteer group focused on voter registration and education in 2016. Incorporated in 2018, the organization declared March 2018 ‚ÄúVoter Registration Month‚Äù in Miami-Dade County. Countless participants came together for a one month long Voter Registration and Information Campaign. Volunteers created voter registration opportunities at local YMCAs, farmers markets, schools, at block parties, festivals, in their homes and at neighborhood parks, the Miami Zoo, near Courthouses, at PAMM, at Miami-Dade College and locations all over Florida.  Notoriety  In 2017 before GoVoteMiami incorporated, they started to work with NACA, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America. They provide VR for their 3000+ seminar participants, first at their seminars in Miami, then in other cities as well. They have 2.2 million members nationwide. Approximately 230k in Florida alone and 327k in Georgia. As a result of their work, applicants are provided training courses with the lending programs. In 2019 GoVoteMiami visited and trained all 50 branches of the Miami Dade Public library System and worked with Director Roy Baker on best practices for VR under the National Voter Registration Act. In 2020 The Miami Foundation designated GoVoteMiami as the ‚ÄúVoter Registration Support‚Äù for a donor funded campaign to raise voter awareness and voter turn-out. Twelve non-profits in Liberty City and Overtown are involved; all of them are being guided and trained by GoVoteMiami volunteers to understand proper voter registration guidelines. As of June 2020, GoVoteMiami is working with Community Health South Florida to design and execute a Voter Awareness Campaign for their 11 clinics, 700 staffs and about 60k patients.  Community Involvement  GoVoteMiami participates in the bi-monthly Ministry Alliance Meeting of Coconut Grove to inform the public about local elections, dates and deadlines.

The storm is remembered for the massive number of trees destroyed. At the time, it was the greatest loss of timber in the country, according to the Forest Service. In the twentieth century, only the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 was stronger. Description The storm started southwest of Washington and tracked northeast. Barometric pressure dropped, reaching a low of 979 millibars (28.90 inches) at which time winds were . Wind velocity quickly increased to . The wind hit at noon in Grays Harbor and moved up the peninsula. The North Head Lighthouse recorded sustained winds at and gusts estimated at before the anemometer was blown away. Inland, gusts reached in Seattle, in Tacoma, and as far inland as Walla Walla. An observer on the M. S. Sierra off the coast of Oregon reported: > At 9 a. m. on the 29th the wind, which previously had died down to force 3, > increased to force 5, SSE.; by noon it had increased to force 12 and changed > to S. and a little later to WSW., when it started to lose its force.

When the wind was at its highest force, between 11 a. m. and 12 noon, > the water of the sea was driven in the air in sheets just like heavy rain > driven by a strong wind. An observer for the Weather Bureau at North Head, thinking that the worst of the storm had passed, drove into town for supplies only to be caught by rapidly increasing winds. In his report, he states: > The southeast wind roared through the forest, the falling trees crashed to > the ground in every direction from where we stood. Many were broken off > where their diameter was as much as 4 feet. A giant spruce fell across the > roadway burying itself through the planks within 10 feet of where we stood. > Three tops broke off and sailed through the air, some of the trees fell with > a crash, others toppled over slowly as their roots were torn from the earth. > In a few minute there were but two trees left standing that were dangerous > to us and we watched every movement of their large trunks and comparatively > small tops. The center of the storm did not make landfall. Because the coast was sparsely populated, damage was to trees, animals, and structures; only one person died in the Great Olympic Blowdown. A weaker windstorm in 1934 killed twenty-one people, injuring more than 100, because its track took it over land. Damage Aerial photograph of wind-blown timber, 1921 Hurricane-force winds destroyed billions of board-feet of timber across the Olympic Peninsula. Over 40 percent of the trees on the southwest side of the Olympic Mountains were blown down. The Great Olympic Blowdown felled eight times more trees than the eruption of Mount Saint Helens. The old-growth timber that was destroyed created a fire hazard, and fire suppression crews were deployed by the U.S. Forest Service, the state of Washington, and the Washington Forest Fire Association (WFFA). Air patrols to support the fire suppression crews were provided by the U.S. Army at Camp Lewis, with the state and WFFA contributing money for gas. A herd of 200 Roosevelt elk were killed near Forks by tree branches and flying debris and hundreds of domestic farm animals were killed. Sixteen homes in La Push were destroyed. Power and telephone lines were downed. Moored boats were dashed on the beaches. Twenty-one barges were adrift in Puget Sound after breaking from their mooring lines. Smokestacks and chimneys collapsed. Chief engineer Alfred A. Anderson was killed at an Aberdeen mill when a collapsing smokestack filled the room with steam, scalding Anderson to death.

His playing career is best remembered for his role on the 1962‚Äì63 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team, which won the 1963 NCAA Championship. Egan was the lone white starting player on a team that broke racial barriers by starting four black players in an era when two or three was considered the maximum. After college, Egan played three years in the short-lived North American Basketball League before retiring from basketball to work as a lawyer. In 2002, Egan was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. The entire 1962‚Äì63 Loyola Ramblers team was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.  Early life  John Egan was born in the early 1940s and grew up in the South Side of Chicago. He was the second-oldest of nine children born to his parents, a police officer and a stay-at-home mother. Egan started playing basketball in elementary school. He played for St. Rita High School, but they never made it past the sectionals of the city tournament. In high school, Egan was scouted by the University of Iowa starting from junior year. The school ultimately offered him a one-year scholarship, but Egan felt he had outplayed others who were given full scholarships, and declined. He was later scouted by Loyola-Chicago coach George Ireland at a Catholic League All-Star game and eventually offered a full scholarship, which he accepted.  College career  Egan with the Loyola Ramblers in the 1963‚Äì64 season Egan played for Loyola-Chicago starting in the 1961‚Äì62 season. That season he played in 27 games and averaged 13.7 points per game. In the 1962‚Äì63 season, Loyola went 24‚Äì2 in the regular season, then went on to win the 1963 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament. Egan again averaged 13.7 points across 31 games. In the 1963‚Äì64 season, Egan averaged 18.5 points across 28 games. Loyola finished 22‚Äì5 but lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to Michigan, which Egan attributed to poor team chemistry.  After college  After graduating Loyola, Egan played three years in the short-lived North American Basketball League. From 1964 to 1967, he played for the Twin City Sailors along with his former Loyola teammates Jerry Harkness and Les Hunter. He also studied at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He worked in the Cook County State's Attorney's office in the late 1960s before starting his own criminal defense practice. In 1980, he moved to the Chicago-area village of River Forest, Illinois, having previously lived in the village of Riverside, Illinois. He has five children, two of them from his current marriage to Mary Egan, whom he met at the law office. Egan was one of several former Loyola players who was a fixture in the stands during the Ramblers' 2018 run to the Final Four.

Igniting on Saturday, June 6, within the rural confines of Quail Canyon, the fire ballooned to an estimated and destroyed three structures including one residential property. The fire was fully contained on Wednesday, June 10, 2020 and the cause still remains under investigation. Events The fire was first reported on the afternoon of Saturday, June 6, at around 3:30 pm, burning off of Quail Canyon and Pleasant Valley Road just outside the community of Winters. Predominantly fanned by dry vegetation and relatively strong onshore winds from the east that prompted several other smaller grassfires to quickly spread in the greater Solano and bay area that day, the fire was met with an aggressive immediate response by fire officials as it quickly jumped from a second-alarm to a four-alarm-plus vegetation fire. Within several hours, the Quail fire expanded from 150 to 500 acres as mandatory evacuations were put in place for over 100 structures in the Pleasant Valley area as the fire blew eastward through Quail Canyon and into the rural subdivisions on the outskirts of Winters. By 9:00 pm the blaze had swelled to 1,200 acres and was 5% contained as mandatory evacuations remained in place overnight for the areas of Quail Canyon Road between Pleasants Valley Road and Highway 128. Throughout the night, the Quail fire exhibited active fire behavior as it crept through the canyons northeast towards Putah Creek where it briefly threatened the Putah Creek State Wildlife Area as it continued to burn eastward towards the community of Winters. By that time, over 600 fire personnel from Woodland, Davis, Butte County and San Francisco were actively engaging the fire. Overnight the fire would continue to grow to some 1,400 before eventually halting at by early Sunday, June 7. Later that day, some evacuation orders were lifted for those living in the Quail Canyon area as containment of the fire rose to 40% despite red flag fire conditions that were expected to persist in the area over the coming days. After the next several days, containment was completed on the fire with no additional growth in acreage. Impact Evacuations were ordered Saturday, June 6, on Quail Canyon Road between Pleasants Valley Road and Highway 128 and an evacuation center was set up at Three Oaks Community Center in Vacaville for accommodations.

He is known as a close friend of the emperor Hadrian. His career is documented in two inscriptions. One is in Latin from Ephesus, erected by an imperial freedman named Hermes. = ILS 1449 The name of the subject is missing, but from the other inscription, erected in Syria and written in Greek, Eudaemon is confirmed as the subject.IGR III.1077 The date of his death is not known, although he may be the same Eudaemon Marcus Aurelius mentions in a list of dead men he looked up to, along with Demetrius and Aulus Claudius Charax.Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, VIII.25  Career  Eudaemon first appears in history when Hadrian appointed him , or \\"procurator of Emperor Hadrian for the administration of Alexandria\\". Anthony Birley provides context for this, placing the appointment at the time Hadrian was proclaimed emperor; Birley is certain that Eudaemon was present at the occasion (August 117), noting that Historia Augusta describes Eudaemon as , Hadrian's \\"accomplice in attaining the throne\\".Historia Augusta, \\"Hadrian\\", 15.1 \\"Eudaemon was evidently dispatched almost at once to Egypt\\", Birley writes, given a minor posting \\"to keep an eye on things there.\\"Birley, Hadrian: the Restless Emperor (London: Routlege, 1997), p. 79 Birley speculates that he arrived with a letter of dismissal for the current prefect, Marcus Rutilius Lupus. Birley further speculates that Eudaemon also encouraged Hadrian \\"to issue an edict confirming the privileges to philosophers, rhetors, , and doctors granted by Vespasian and Trajan.\\" His next recorded appointment was to manage the Greek and Latin libraries at Rome. This was followed by the , or overseer of the Emperor's Greek correspondence; Birley dates this to 126 or 127, after the emperor had returned to Italy and found himself busy attending to the petitions of the cities of Greece.Birley, Hadrian, p. 197 Further appointments followed. Eudaemon held a procuratorship in Asia Minor comprising Lycia, Pamphylia, Galatia, Paphlagonia, Pisidia and Pontus, with a salary of over 100,000 sesterces. Then followed and . This is an abnormal combination of two appointments, the first concerning Rome and the second in the provinces; Henriette Pavis d'Escurac explains this combination with the supposition that Hadrian took Eudaemon with him on his travels in the East.Pavis d'Escurac, La pr√©fecture de l'annone, service administratif imp√©rial d'Auguste √† Constantin (Rome: Ecole fran√ßaise de Rome, 1976), p. 341 Eudaemon then became , probably when Hadrian spent the winter of 129/130 in Antioch. The Greek inscription allows us to add more two posts to the career of Valerius Eudaemon, which includes a palatine secretariat. The Historia Augusta notes that Hadrian turned against many of his friendships by the last years of his reign, providing a list of names that includes Eudaemon, whom Hadrian \\"reduced to poverty.\\" However, after a space of several years Antoninus Pius rehabilitated him. We know that Eudaemon was appointed governor of Egypt, which he held from 142 to 143.Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), p. 289 Beginning with Arthur Stein and Hans-Georg Pflaum, it has been assumed he was appointed to one of these other two prefectures first: or . Pavis d'Escurac believes it was more appropriate that Eudaemon was , the immediate predecessor of Lucius Valerius Proculus. His primary concern as governor of Egypt was to safeguard the harvest and delivery of grain to the populace of Rome, but surviving letters from his administration show his responsibilities extended further. One concerns his investigation and grant of immunity from liturgy to a doctor who mummified corpses.Oxyrhynchus Papyri, 40. English translation in A. S. Hunt and C.C. Edgar, Select Papyri, II.

The mountains are laccoliths formed by intrusion of magma during the late Eocene through early Oligocene that have been historically important as a mining district.Maynard 2005 Description Sample of monzonite from the Ortiz porphyry belt The main belt extends from the Cerrillos Hills in the north through the Ortiz Mountains to the San Pedro Mountains () and South Mountain (). Cerro Pelon () is also geologically a part of the belt. Each of the clusters of mountains is a laccolith where magma intruded between sedimentary rock beds and cooled to form a dome-shaped body of rock. Magma preferentially intruded along bedding planes in the country rock, particularly in more ductile beds such as shales of the Chinle Formation or Mancos Shale. In some places, the magma broke through to the surface as volcanoes. The overlying volcanic rock and sedimentary beds subsequently were eroded away to leave the more resistant laccoliths. The laccoliths have been radiometrically dated as 33.2 to 36.2 Ma. This was during Laramide compression of the Earth's crust in New Mexico, which favored formation of sills and laccoliths instead of dikes. A second set of intrusions at 27.9 to 31.4 Ma took place after compression had reversed and the crust in the area was put into tension, and these took the form of dikes and stocks that are responsible for most of the metal mineralization of the mining district. The rock of the intrusions is fairly uniform over the entire belt and has been described as porphyritic andesite or monzonite. It typically consists of a roughly equal mixture of plagioclase and alkali feldspar with smaller quantities of quartz and considerable hornblende. Clasts of this composition make up most of the Espinaso Formation in the neighboring sedimentary basins, which is interpreted as fanglomerate from Ortiz volcanoes. Cieneguilla basanite Cerro Seguro, a large hill underlain by Cieneguilla Basanite and Ortiz quartz monzonite The younger intrusions in the belt are increasingly alkaline in composition, and include the 25-26 Ma Cieneguilla basanite. This is a small-volume extrusive unit exposed around the village of La Cienega that may represent the earliest stages of opening of the Rio Grande rift. The basanite is characterized by olivine phenocrysts in a matrix of clinopyroxene, magnetite, and nepheline, with a total silica content of 42.40-44.10 wt % and a high magnesium oxide content (11.50-13.50 wt %). This places the basanite among the most primitive magmas of the central Rio Grande rift. Isotope data suggests that the basanite came from mixed mantle source regions.Lindline et al. 2011 Economic geology Turquoise and precious and base metals have been mined from the Ortiz porphyry belt from prehistoric times. Native Americans worked the Cerrillos Hills for turquoise and galena beginning before 700 CE. The mines were particularly active at the peak of the Chaco culture around 1000 to 1200 CE and during the expansion of pueblo culture in the Rio Grande valley in 1350 to 1680 CE. Turquoise mining was centered at Mount Calchihuitl and Turquoise Hill, the former producing an open pit across and deep, and was all done with stone tools. Lead was mined for pottery glaze at Mina del Tiro, Bathsheba, and numerous other locations. Spanish mining began in the 1580s with emphasis on silver and lead ores, centered on Mina del Tiro and Bathsheba. Mina del Tiro continued to be sporadically worked until 1943. There was a brief mining boom between 1879 and 1881 that produced over a thousand mine claims, but most never developed beyond prospects and only a few dozen became working mines. Mining collapsed after the First World War.Kretzmann 2020 The Ortiz Mountains have been mined for gold since the 1830s. The Ortiz Mine Grant has produced some 350,000 ounces of gold, and remaining reserves are estimated at 1 million ounces of gold and 18,000 metric tons of copper, mostly in Carache Canyon and Lukas Canyon. Mining ceased in the 1980s and Santa Fe Gold, the current mineral rights owner, has encountered opposition to resuming mining from local land owners.Matlock 2013  Footnotes  References   * Category:Paleogene geology of New Mexico ","title":"Ortiz porphyry belt"},{"id":"64216983","text":"Kalonymos Joseph ben Joel of Heuberg (Hebrew: ◊ß◊ú◊ï◊†◊ô◊û◊ï◊° ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£ ◊ë◊ü ◊ô◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊û◊î◊ï◊ô◊ë◊¢◊®◊í) (German: Koloman Josef aus Heuberg; 1726 - 1763) was a German-Jewish rabbi and scholar.

The founder and director of the Kiknteatr company, she is the winner of 10 Peter Traves√≠ National Theater Awards, in addition to having received various distinctions and recognitions in her country and abroad. Her theater has been characterized by a contemporary style, in which performing and visual arts are mixed. Aramburo has spent much of her career abroad, being frequently invited to direct in theaters and independent companies in various countries in the Americas and Europe. In May 2018, the artist made her change of gender identity to female official, in an act that sparked intense public debate. Biography and artistic career The child of an architect, Diego Aramburo was born on 8 September 1971 in Cochabamba, the city where she began her acting career at age 17. With studies carried out in Brazil, Spain, France, Canada, and the United States, and apprenticeships with teachers such as Jerzy Grotowski, Declan Donnellan, Yoshi Oida, Jos√© Sanchis Sinisterra, , and Rafael Spregelburd, Aramburo quickly became the a well-known and controversial director in Cochabamba. In 1996, she founded the K√≠kinteatro ‚Äì later shortened to Kiknteatr ‚Äì whose name comes from the words k√≠kin (\\"similar to\\", in Quechua) and teatro (\\"theater\\", in Spanish). Her first play with the company was Tres fases de la luna, for which she won her first Peter Traves√≠ National Theater Award. Her subsequent plays, Feroz, Amataramarta, and Ese cuento del amor (written with Claudia Eid), quickly established Aramburo as the most awarded director in Bolivia and brought her invitations to festivals in other countries. Although from the beginning the Kiknteatr opted for its own dramaturgy, it also staged productions by other authors, as with Tierra (2003) by French playwright , 4.48 Psychosis (2004) by Sarah Kane, and Happy Days (2007) by Samuel Beckett. In 2004, Aramburo wrote and directed one of her best-known plays, Crudo, with performances by Pati Garc√≠a, Jorge Alaniz, Alejandro Mara√±√≥n, L√≠a Michel, and Daniel Larraz√°bal. Garc√≠a, Alaniz, Mara√±√≥n, and Michel have been part of the casts of several of Aramburo's shows. Other notable works in the company's history were Transparente (2009), Romeo y Julieta de Aramburo (2013),and the Bolivian Trilogy, comprising Ukhupacha, Morales, and Hejarei (2014‚Äì2015). Parallel to her work in Bolivia, Aramburo has been invited to direct plays in countries such as Canada, Argentina, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, France, and Romania. In recent years, her productions have also been selected for performance at festivals in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, Spain, and Estonia. Her plays Feroz, Ese Cuento del Amor, and Fragmentos L√≠quidos have been staged abroad. Aramburo's works have garnered nearly 30 national and international awards, including two Medals of Honor awarded by the Government of Bolivia, career awards from the Santa Cruz de la Sierra International Theater Festival and the Bertolt Brecht National Theater Festival, and her appointment as teacher of Latin American theater in Colombia. Gender change In May 2018, Diego Aramburo was legally recognized as a woman under Bolivia's Law 807 on Gender Identity. According to the artist ‚Äì who made no changes to her body or name ‚Äì the measure was adopted as \\"a way of fighting against the strict heteronormalization of Bolivian society\\" and \\"breaking with the cultural barriers around gender identity.\\" The process that the artist went through to legalize her new identity was documented in Genero (2018), an expanded work of art made in co-production with Ecuador and Brazil and with the backing of Iberescena. Although she received the support of various personalities related to the arts, teaching, and activism, Aramburo was also the target of criticism for the action, sparking intense debate on the subject. Style Diego Aramburo's works are framed within contemporary theater, with a strong influence of the visual and performing arts, and an interest in mixing different languages on stage, using audiovisual projections ‚Äì often recorded in real time ‚Äì live music, and exploration of new technologies. Considered an innovative and transgressive director, especially for the canons of the Bolivian theater ‚Äì which she frequently represents at international festivals, but moving away from the idea of \\"Bolivianity\\" understood as something folkloric, costumbrista, or autochthonous - Aramburo has a body of work in which it is possible to identify some recurring themes or concerns: sexuality, identity, ancestry, obscenity, Bolivian history, and vices and abuse of power.

History  The mosque was first built in the late 12th century under the Almohad dynasty, and is located in the Ain al-Kheil (\\"Spring of the Horse\\") neighbourhood. It is notable for its association with Ibn Arabi, the Sufi master from al-Andalus, who visited Fes multiple times and frequently retreated to this mosque for prayer and meditation in the late 1190s. The mosque has recently been the subject of a restoration and rehabilitation effort following the collapse of several adjacent houses in 2006 which killed 10 people and destroyed a part of the mosque. The restoration effort has been spearheaded by the Moroccan Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs in cooperation with the World Monuments Fund, with the intention of promoting the association of Ibn Arabi with Fes.  Architecture  The mosque is unusual in two respects. One is its octagonal minaret, which is rare in Fes and in much of Morocco where minarets with a square base are standard. Its other unusual characteristic is that it has two prayer halls on two different stories. The prayer halls are nonetheless in the usual hypostyle format with rows of columns supporting horseshoe arches. The mosque also has a courtyard with a fountain, like other sahns of Moroccan mosques.

In 1913, Baldwin was described as having \\"a sort of Howard Chandler Christy girl plus vaudeville sprightliness, the delightful American type we all fall for every time.\\" Baldwin and her first husband Percy Bronson performed together in an act known as \\"Bronson and Baldwin.\\" They performed together in the play So Long Letty at the Shubert Theatre, singing \\"Pass around the Apples Once Again.\\" Baldwin performed in Mercenary Mary at the Longacre Theatre in 1925. Don Carle Gillette wrote that Baldwin \\"helps the comedy along and puts over a couple of song numbers well.\\" She later partnered with Joe Morris; their act was called Morris and Baldwin. Baldwin performed at Loew's American Theatre in 1928. A review in The Billboard stated, \\"Her easy, winning manner suggests that Miss Baldwin with a newly written act would go over big. She is capable of rising to the summit, but never quite reaches the heights.\\" Baldwin wrote two plays, including House of Mander, also referred to as Mander's Sons, which played at the Apollo in Atlantic City, New Jersey in October 1929. A review read, \\"Despite its faults, the play has some dramatic force, and with the lustful emotions of its chief character, may have a chance, providing it gets by New York's equivalent to 'the watch and ward' society.\\" It was staged by Lawrence Marston.

Early life and education LeJean was born on November 12, 1984, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Growing up, she enjoyed playing basketball in school, which she did from grade 5 to grade 10. Following her junior year at Glace Bay High School where she had begun to play rugby, LeJean suffered a spinal cord injury in a motor accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down. Upon returning to school, she was pushed by former Olympian Sue MacLeod to return to sports and complete her rehabilitation in the pool. She began to swim competitively, with the goal of qualifying for Canada's national swimming team, but developed tendonitis in both shoulders and was forced to quit. LeJean enrolled in Cape Breton University for her undergraduate degree in political science and communications before moving to Halifax to work with Communications Nova Scotia. Career While living in Halifax, LeJean was encouraged by her friends to start playing wheelchair basketball due to her love of the sport. She attended the 2011 Canada Games and approached coach Steve Sampson about qualifying for the team. He told her she was out of shape and must push herself in her wheelchair at least five kilometers a day. After a month of training, she began playing wheelchair basketball competitively until her tendonitis flared up again. Her coach then suggested that she try track and field and throwing sports due her to wide wingspan. According to her, she threw the national standard on her first try. 2013 was a career- changing year for LeJean, who made her international track and field debut and was asked to join the Canadian Para-National Team. She trained in Edmonton before attending her first international tournament in Arizona where she won two silver medals. From there, LeJean drew attention from the Canadian national senior team after winning a gold and silver medal in the parashot put and para discuss events during the Canada Summer Games. While training in Ottawa, LeJean was made aware that she was named to Canada's senior national team and would be flown out to Lyon, France to compete with Canada at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships. In her national team debut, she won a bronze medal in shotput and was later named the Canadian Top Athlete of the Year. Leading up to the 2016 Paralympic Games, LeJean competed in international tournaments around the world including Dubai, Toronto, and Qatar. At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Qatar she earned a silver medal in the T53 shot put women's final and later took home a gold medal at the 2015 Parapan American Games. Prior to qualifying for the Paralympic Games, LeJean also set a new North American shot put record at the 2016 Aileen Meagher International Track Classic. At the women‚Äôs para-shot put event, she threw 4.48 metres to beat her previous personal best of 4.46 metres and win gold. On August 11, 2016, LeJean was one of 24 Canadians named to Team Canada's Track and Field roster for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Brazil. Competing in the women‚Äôs F53 shot put event, she missed the podium and placed fourth overall. She bounced back from the loss and by 2018, was ranked number 1 in shot put and javelin and number 2 in discuss. LeJean announced her retirement from the sport in August 2019, ending her career as the Canadian record holder in the F53 discus, javelin, and shot put. A few months later, she was announced as an inductee into the Cape Breton Sports Hall of Fame.

Background Walter Goldwater was born on July 29, 1907, in Harlem, New York. His father, Dr. Abraham Goldwater, was a radical and knew prominent black activists including W.E.B. DuBois. In 1927, after starting college at the City College of New York, he graduated from the University of Michigan. Career Early in his career, Goldwater worked for Alexander Trachtenberg (here, in Moscow, Fall 1922) of International Publishers. Initially, Goldwater took clerical jobs to support himself. In 1930, Goldwater joined International Publishers, \\"the most prominent communist publishing organization in the United States,\\" run by Alexander Trachtenberg. In 1931, Goldwater and his wife Ethel, who had joined him in studying Russian, traveled to Moscow, USSR. There, they helped set up the Cooperative Publishing Society of Foreign Workers. Both then worked there as translators and editors. Goldwater was a critic of Stalin, which landed him in trouble with authorities, after which the Goldwater's returned to New York in early 1932. In 1932, Goldwater opened University Place Book Shop on \\"Book Row\\" at 821 Broadway at 12th Street (or at 69 University Place) with a loan from his uncle Jack Biblo (of Biblo & Tannen bookstore) of $600 (or his uncle Abe Sugarman). The bookstore specialized in African, African-American, and Caribbean (West Indies) literature as well as used, old, and rare books. Other specialties included chess, Russia, and radicalism. In 1933, Arthur Spingarn, brother of NAACP founder Joel Spingarn, started a standing order for books by African-American authors. Around 1932 or 1933, Whittaker Chambers tried to recruit Goldwater to open a bookstore near Columbia University to serve as a meeting place for Communist (Soviet) underground agents as well as mail drop. Upon checking with the Communist Party USA at its headquarters on Union Square, he found the idea rejected by the Party because his knowledge of the Russian language looked suspicious. Others whom Chambers tried to recruit in the same period included: Herbert Solow, David Zabladowsky, Diana Trilling, and Robert Cantwell. Goldwater purchased an estimated ten thousand \\"little magazines\\" (e.g., Bibelot, Black Cat, Yellow Book, and Philistine) from nearby Pratt bookshop. Over time, he sold these to universities, including Yale University and the University of Connecticut. Goldwater helped found the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America and collected books printed in the 15th century. In 1950, Goldwater published a new edition of W.E.B. DuBois' Black Reconstruction. Goldwater helped found Dissent with Irving Howe (here, University of Michigan, 1967-1968) In 1954, Goldwater joined Irving Howe and others in founding Dissent magazine. He published the magazine for 15 years. He collected and wrote about collecting Incunabula, which he later had auctioned by Swann Galleries before his death.  Personal life and death Goldwater married Eleanor Lowenstein (died 1980) was also an antiquarian. She ran the Corner Book Shop (102 Fourth Avenue at 11th Street) which specialized in cookbooks. They had two children. Goldwater and his friend Dwight Macdonald formed the bases for two characters in Mary McCarthy's 1949 novel The Oasis. Goldwater was a \\"formidable\\" chess player who competed in New York tournaments and also served as president of the Marshall Chess Club in Greenwich Village. He proudly lost to chess champion Bobby Fischer. In later life, Goldwater helped broker manuscripts and collections regarding labor and the left to universities, particularly the Tamiment Library at New York University. In 1993, Goldwater gave a long interview to the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook, in which he recounted all the booksellers he had known in his life. Legacy In his will, Goldwater left University Place Book Shop to long-time employee William French, who ran the shop from 1985 to 1988. French had started working at the bookstore in 1960. He left books to the New York Public Library and its Schomberg Center. University Place Book Shop closed in 1995, mostly due to rising costs and a debt of $64,00 0 in unpaid rent. French sold remaining books to New York University.

About 1,000 residents in the area were evacuated for a time, and, some of the gasoline entered a nearby creek. * 1984 On March 27, a pipeline rupture destroyed a home, and, damaged 4 other buildings, in Mont Belvieu, Texas * 1984 On April 24, a contractor installing plastic drainage pipe on a farm near Rock Rapids, Iowa hit a petroleum products pipeline, spilling about 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel. * 1984 On June 19, six employees of a contractor working for Washington Gas Light Company (WGL) in Rockville, Maryland, were using mechanical saws to cut a section of 22-inch steel pipeline when residual gas at atmospheric pressure in the isolated section of the pipeline was ignited. A flash fire ensued, and four contractor employees who were operating the saws and a WGL superintendent were burned. * On August 14, a Plantation Pipeline line leaked near Ladysmith, Virginia, creating a gasoline mist in the area. * 1984 Two natural gas pipelines exploded and burned near Falls City, Texas. * 1984 On September 24, a failed gas main of ABS plastic caused an explosion and fire in Phoenix, Arizona. 5 people died and 7 others injured in the accident. Liquid in the pipe had caused it to break down. * 1984 A tugboat hit and ruptured a gas pipeline on the Houston Ship Channel on October 16.

One pipeline was owned by Mobil, the other pipeline was owned by Total S.A.. About of petroleum were spilled. * 1984 A Williams Companies 6 inch pipeline ruptured on November 18 in New Brighton, Minnesota, causing a spill of 40,000 to 50,000 gallons of jet fuel in an industrial area. There were no injuries. * 1984 On November 25, a 30-inch gas transmission pipeline, constructed in 1955 and operating at 1,000 psig pressure, ruptured at a location about three miles (5 km) west of Jackson, Louisiana. Gas blowing from the rupture fractured the pipe into many pieces and created a hole in the earth about long, wide, and deep. The escaping gas was quickly ignited by one of several potential sources of ignition. The resulting fire incinerated an area extending from the rupture about north, south, and to the east and to the west. Within this sparsely populated area, five persons involved with the pipeline construction work were killed, and 23 persons were injured. Additionally, several pieces of construction equipment were damaged extensively. Lack of proper ground support under the pipeline when a nearby section of that pipeline was upgraded and replaced was identified as a factor in the failure.

Biography = Ancestry  Stadion was a member of the noble Stadion family and was a son of Count Emerich Joseph Philipp von Stadion und Thannhausen (14 December 1766 ‚Äì 11 January 1817) and Charlotta Maria von der Leyen und zu Hohengeroldseck (4 April 1768 ‚Äì 12 January 1832).  Military career  After early military service in the Bavarian Army, Stadion joined the Austrian Empire‚Ä≤s Cuirassier Regiment No. 1 in 1823 with the rank of leutnant (lieutenant). In 1830 he transferred at the rank of oberleutnant to become adjutant to the infantry regiment F√ºrst Alois Liechtenstein No. 12. In January 1834 he served in a squadron of Uhlan Regiment No. 1, where he was promoted to major in 1839. In the same year he became wing adjutant to Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and rose in this position in 1842 to oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel). Appointed Colonel Treasurer of the Emperor in 1845, he moved to Schwarzenberg Uhlan Regiment No. 2, where he was promoted to oberst (colonel). In July 1848 during the First Italian War of Independence (1848‚Äì1849), Stadion took over a patrol column as part of the division of Archduke Ernest of Austria and was commissioned, in association with the brigade of General von Hahne, to disperse the followers of Giuseppe Garibaldi. In January 1849 he was promoted to generalmajor (major general) and took over a brigade under Feldmarschal (Field Marshal) Joseph Radetzky von Radetz in northern Italy. He took part in the Battle of Novara on 23 March 1849, in which he was seriously wounded. He received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Leopold and the Order of the Iron Crown Second Class for his service in the war. On 26 October 1852 Stadion was promoted to feldmarschall-leutnant (lieutenant field marshal) and took command of a division of the VIII Army Corps. In 1855 he was appointed commanding general of the V Army Corps and in 1856 to the Geheimrat (Privy Council). With the V Army Corps Stadion participated in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 against the French-Sardinian coalition in Lombardy. Together with his chief of staff, Colonel Josef Freiherr von Ringelsheim, his troops fought in the opening battle ‚Äî the Battle of Montebello, on 20 May 1859 ‚Äî and after retreating from that battlefield he fell back to the bridgehead at Vacarezza. In the Battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859, his troops were concentrated in the center, where they succumbed despite putting up a steadfast defense against the French. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria honored him with the Order of the Iron Crown First Class including war decoration. After the death of Archduke John of Austria in May 1859, Stadion succeeded John as inhaber (proprietor) of Dragoon Regiment No. 1, which was later renamed the 9th Cuirassier Regiment. In 1863 he retired as a cavalry general and in 1867 was appointed Landkomtur (National Commander) of the Teutonic Order in Austria. He died in Vienna in 1868 at the age of 69 and was buried there in the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery.

It is his feature- length film debut. Siberia and Him premiered at the 2019 NewFest film festival. Plot Dima, a policeman, and Sasha, a farm-hand, both live in a run-down town in Siberia where the local police make guerrilla-like raids against the local gay scene. The movie begins by showing Sasha attempting to commit suicide by hanging himself, which he fails to do successfully. Sasha is involved with Dima, his brother-in-law, in a secret relationship, which creates a secret tension between the two characters in their small town. When Sasha fails to contact his grandmother in a far-away village, Dima accompanies him on a days-long trek to see to Sasha's grandmother's well-being. During their days-long journey, much naturalistic cinematography is used to evoke the Siberian countryside. They reach their destination and see to Sasha's grandmother's well-being. Afterwards, Sasha and Dima during their return trek have a fight where Dima kills Sasha. Dima returns to his native village and eventually commits suicide. Cast * Viatcheslav Kopturevsky as Sasha * Ilya Shubochkin as Dima * Anastasia Voskresenskaya as Anna * Irina Novokreshennuh as Mother Critical reception The few independent critical reviews of the film have been generally positive.

Roger Walker-Dack, writing for Queerguru.com calls the film \\"an excellent, heart-wrenching drama\\".

Bea Nilsson was Finn's on and off girlfriend. Though she had been sceptical due to his controlling of her in the past, they had decided to recommence their relationship the previous year, to the shock of the Kennedys and Bea's sister Elly Conway. However, Finn had regained his feelings for Elly in the past few months after helping her give birth to her daughter Aster and he decided to eliminate Bea believing her to be the only obstacle for Elly and his relationship by pushing Bea into an old mine. Prue Wallace and Gary Canning, who were the actual victims, were initially suspected due to the former's return as a guest after a previous stint and the latter's history with Finn after Finn had manipulated and attempted to kill his daughter Xanthe Canning (Lily van der Meer). Finn was himself suspected of being one of the deaths due to his enumerating enemies from his previous time in Ramsay Street and after it was revealed his memories would come back prior to the show's celebration week. Promotion and broadcast In December 2019, Rob Mills announced that he had departed Neighbours and that his exit would air the following year. On 4 February 2020, it was announced that the show was planning a massive storyline for its 35th anniversary week with three deaths, five marriages and a central storyline with Mills' character Finn Kelly returning to his evil ways. They also revealed that at least nine characters from different eras of the show would be returning in the weeks leading up to or during the week. However the identities of the victims were kept a secret until broadcast and there were many trailers hinting at various characters being potential victims. Prior to Prue Wallace's (Denise van Outen)'s demise it was revealed by Greg Barnett that there were initially meant to be two deaths of two main characters who had reached their natural death, but a third death was added when they realised it would \\"put the '3' in the '35'\\". It was later revealed that the third and final death would take place the following week following a two-hander between Finn and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Reception In Australia the average rating for the regular episodes (Part 1) was 142,200 viewer with the peak on viewing on Thursday at 159,000 viewers. In the UK, the show failed to make the top 15 viewed episodes for that week. (User must select Channel 5 in the Channels field and then the appropriate date, device type and consolidation figures for the episode) Daniel Kilkelly called the drama a \\"game-changer\\", praising the fact that the deaths would have a long lasting impact on the show. Stephen Patterson described the week as being full of \\"love, laughter, tears, terror and all round unmissable drama\\" while noting that viewers could have many questions needing to be answered. Rose Hill of The Mirror described Gary's death as \\"brutal\\", Finn as a \\"cold-blooded killer\\" and even speculated how far Finn was going to go to cover his tracks during the next episode. Denise van Outen, who played Prue Wallace, praised the show for the \\"dramatic\\" nature of her character's death and told Digital Spy that she \\"wanted people to talk about it\\", while also hinting that Prue may still have survived as Neighbours bosses had not ruled out a return for her. Colette Mann and Chris Milligan, who play Sheila and Kyle Canning respectively, particularly praised Damien Richardson for his work on the show after his final scenes aired and wished him the best of luck for the future.

The station operated on channel 62 until 1971 and on channel 21 from 1971 to 1978. Owned throughout its existence by Thoms Broadcasting, WANC-TV was originally a network affiliate, though it gradually lost all of its affiliations. For most of the 1970s, it operated as a Christian independent by rebroadcasting some programs of WGGS-TV in Greenville, South Carolina. Facing financial difficulty and the loss of its transmitter site, the station shut down in 1979. The channel 21 license was sold to Pappas Telecasting, which began the lengthy reconstruction of the station as WHNS, a general-market independent station which launched in 1984. History=Early years as WISE-TV The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted radio station WISE (1310 AM) a construction permit for a new television station to broadcast on channel 62 in Asheville on October 29, 1952. WISE was owned by Harold Thoms alongside stations in Charlotte (WAYS), Greensboro (WCOG), and Durham (WSSB); it was the only applicant for channel 62, whereas VHF channel 13 was being fought for by radio stations WLOS and WSKY. The station plans were almost abandoned amid the first proposals to build a cable television system to import signals from Charlotte, which Thoms charged would have made his proposed channel 62 unviable. WISE-TV began telecasting on August 2, 1953 as Asheville's first television station. Channel 62 aired programming (on kinescope) from all networks, but reflecting the association of WISE radio with NBC, it was a primary affiliate of that network. The original studio facilities were on land leased from Asheville- Biltmore College, which received two hours a week in air time for educational programming; the channel 62 transmitter was located on Beaucatcher Mountain. Competition arrived the next year when WLOS-TV, operating on VHF channel 13, started up; the new station assumed the ABC and DuMont affiliations. WISE-TV attempted to get a VHF channel to improve its competitive position, proposing to operate on channel 2 instead of 62. The station in its initial years on air operated under special temporary authority at just 1,000 watts. It would not be until December 1957 that channel 62 broadcast at its intended effective radiated power of 24,000 watts. In 1964, Spartanburg CBS affiliate WSPA-TV improved its service to Asheville by building a translator on channel 72 at White Fawn Reservoir, which provided a stronger signal and reached homes shaded from its main transmitter at Hogback Mountain. During the application process, it was noted that WISE-TV aired little more than NBC network shows and \\"extremely limited\\" live programming. In 1966, the station received a construction permit to move from channel 62 to channel 21. WISE-TV became WANC-TV on February 3, 1967. Cable comes to Asheville Thoms expressed his interest in obtaining a cable television franchise for the Asheville area throughout the mid-1960s, being the first to file for the rights in 1964 and challenging city council decisions that would have granted the franchise to other applicants. Thoms backed a successful referendum to win the franchise in July 1967. When the system finally launched in 1968, it brought signals from NBC affiliates WFBC-TV in Greenville, South Carolina, and WCYB-TV in Bristol, Tennessee. At that time, WANC-TV disaffiliated from NBC. It was one of the last stations in a top-100 media market to not have color video tape equipment. It would not be until 1971 that channel 62 finally went silent to complete the conversion to channel 21, five years after receiving the original permit. The Christian years In 1974, the station began to air programs from the Christian Broadcasting Network in prime time hours. It also aired some programming from Christian independent station WGGS-TV in Greenville, including its local \\"Nightline\\" program. A 1976 profile of WGGS-TV described channel 21 as rebroadcasting it in the evenings, while the station was described as a satellite of the Greenville outlet in 1977. In June 1977, Thoms filed to sell WANC-TV to Carolina Christian Broadcasting, owner of WGGS-TV, for $60.000. The FCC opted to designate a hearing on the matter; it found that the sale of WANC-TV to Carolina Christian would be an inefficient use of spectrum, as there were available sites for WGGS-TV to relocate and begin covering Asheville. CCB opted to drop its bid to purchase the station and pursue other avenues of serving Asheville. Sale to Pappas Telecasting After the sale to Carolina Christian Broadcasting collapsed, Thoms lost its lease on the channel 21 transmitter site, forcing the station to go off the air. It then reached a deal to sell WANC-TV to Pappas Telecasting of Visalia, California, for $206,000 in June 1979. The sale became effective September 14, and twelve days later, on September 26, the call letters were changed to WHNS. Pappas embarked on a multi-year project to build a new channel 21 transmitter atop Slick Rock Mountain in Transylvania County, accompanied by a primary base in Greenville and studios in Asheville. After years of delays related to the transmitter change, channel 21 returned to the region April 1, 1984.

The Hebrew word for meal is seudah, with the plural version being seudos or seudot, thus the Friday night and Saturday day meals are often called seudot or seudos. The third meal, held on Saturday afternoon is called either shalosh seudos, seudah shlishit, or shaleshudus. Friday Night Meal Two whole-wheat challot The Friday night meal traditional begins with the singing of \\"Shalom Aleichem\\", a song welcoming the angels that the Talmud says visit every Jewish home on Friday night.Talmud, Shabbat 119b This is often followed by the singing of \\"Eishet Chayil\\" (Proverbs 31, also pronounced \\"eishes chayil\\"), a song praising the Jewish woman. In most communities, the singing of \\"Eishet Chayil\\" is followed by kiddush, the Jewish practice of sanctifying the Sabbath over a cup wine or grape juice. Following kiddush, the meal continues with handwashing before eating bread. The meal then begins, with the head of the household lifting up two challah breads, and reciting the blessing of Hamotzi. The challah is sliced, dipped into salt, and eaten. The meal continues with festive foods (often chicken), often with singing and sharing Torah thoughts. In many German-Jewish households, the washing for the bread is done before kiddush, instead of doing it right before the blessing of Hamotzi and the eating of the challot. This is so people don't wait around in between kiddush and handwashing, as people often do. Instead, they can eat the bread without getting up. It is customary at Ashkenazic Shabbos meals to eat \\"gefilte fish\\" at the beginning of the meal, a dish made of ground, deboned fish, commonly carp, whitefish, pike, and Nile perch. Chicken soup is also commonly eaten at the Friday night meal. Saturday Day Meal Cholent The Saturday morning meal traditionally begins with kiddush and Hamotzi on two challot, like the Friday night meal. It is customary to eat hot foods at this meal. During and after the Second Temple period, the Sadducees, who rejected the Oral Torah, didn't eat heated food on Shabbat (as heated food appears to be prohibited in the written section of the Torah). To express that they followed the Oral Torah, the followers of the Tannaim specifically ate heated food on Shabbat. The tradition of eating hot foods on Shabbat has lasted till today. In Ashkenazic communities, the custom of eating hot foods is observed by eating cholent, a stew made primarily of meat, potatoes, beans, barley and spices. Sauces, onions, carrots, hot dogs, kugel, and ketchup are often added. Sephardic Jews, including Moroccans and Iraqis observe the custom of eating hot foods by eating chamin (Hebrew for hot), a similar stew. Bukharian Jews eat a similar stew called Osh Sovo (or \\"ussvo\\"). Shalosh Seudos The third meal of Shabbat, called Shalosh seudos, Seudah Shlishit (which literally means \\"Third Meal\\" in Hebrew), or Shaleshudus, begins before sundown of Saturday night, although it may continue after. It begins with washing for bread and reciting the Hamotzi blessing on two challot. Dairy is sometimes eaten at shalosh seudos.

The railroad was originally constructed in 1865 between Oil City, Pennsylvania, a local oil transportation hub, and the boomtown of Pithole, Pennsylvania. Constructed under the charter of the Clarion Land and Improvement Company, it was informally known as the Oil City and Pithole Branch Railroad. Although it was generally supported by the broad gauge Atlantic and Great Western Railway, it was built to standard gauge. Conflict with the Warren and Franklin Railway over the right-of-way along the Allegheny River led to a lawsuit which, in 1866, declared that the Oil City and Pithole had no right to operate along the river from Oleopolis, Pennsylvania to Oil City. That part of the line was sold to the Warren and Franklin, leaving the Oil City and Pithole with a line running north from Oleopolis to Pithole along Pithole Creek. The loss of the line into Oil City, and economic issues in the Pennsylvania oil fields more generally, rendered the railroad unprofitable: it was sequestered in December 1866, and thereafter run by George V. Forman on behalf of its creditors. Forman worked with Jacob Vandergrift, a major investor in the railroad, to facilitate oil shipments originating on the railroad by the construction of a pipeline to Pithole and the operation of a tank car line. By 1870, however, the boom in the immediate vicinity of Pithole was over. The railroad was sold under foreclosure and reorganized in the following year as the Pithole Valley Railway. The new board included S. L. M. Barlow, a lawyer closely associated with the Atlantic and Great Western. The new management was also closely connected with the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad, chartered in 1882, which would have tapped the oil fields from the north for the benefit of the Atlantic and Great Western. The Pithole Valley would have been extended north through Pleasantville, Pennsylvania, another oil-producing town, to connect with the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad's main line. The Atlantic and Great Western sold a large bond issue to cover the construction and extension of these railroads, which was to be paid back from their revenues when completed. However, the money from the bonds was diverted to cover interest on the Atlantic and Great Western's existing mortgage bonds, so no extension of the Pithole Valley ever took place. Still unprofitable to operate, the rails and equipment were removed by 1876 and sold to the Shenango and Allegheny Railroad, another Atlantic and Great Western affiliate. The Pithole Valley remained in existence as a paper corporation through at least 1885, but was never rebuilt or operated again. Background The drilling of the Drake Well in 1859 demonstrated that petroleum could be extracted in commercially viable quantities from oil deposits in northwestern Pennsylvania, and stimulated a regional boom in oil extraction. The Pennsylvania oilfields were located in a remote region of the state, lacking an extensive transportation network; in the initial stages of the boom, the crude oil was generally shipped by water down the Allegheny River to be refined in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The unreliability of water transport (due to ice and low water levels in season) encouraged the construction of railroads into the oilfield. Three trunk lines, the Erie, the New York Central (NYC), and the Pennsylvania (PRR), were close enough to extend, via subsidiaries, into the oil region; together, they allowed oil producers to ship crude oil not only to Pittsburgh, but to the New York City area, where extensive refining capacity already existed from processing cannel coal in the 1850s. A rail link to the oil region made it possible for John D. Rockefeller and his partners to found the first oil refinery in Cleveland, Ohio in 1863, and the refining industry there soon came to rival that of New York or Pittsburgh. Map of the Venango County oil region, showing waterways, Oil City, and Titusville. The first railroad to reach the oil fields was the Oil Creek Railroad, which built from Corry, Pennsylvania south along Oil Creek, reaching Titusville in 1862 and Petroleum Center in 1863. Construction stopped here, although the railroad had charter rights to build south to the mouth of Oil Creek at Oil City, and then downstream along the Allegheny River to Franklin, Pennsylvania. The Oil Creek Railroad was initially built to a broad gauge compatible with the Erie system; a connection at Corry with the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, another broad gauge railroad, allowed oil from the region to move north over the Erie to New York, and from November 1863, to Cleveland as well. In 1863, it made its line dual gauge, allowing it to interchange cars with the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, a PRR subsidiary, which also connected with it at Corry. however, this line ran east from Corry only as far as Warren, on the Allegheny River, and would not be completed to a link with the rest of the PRR at Williamsport until November 1864. Until then, oil traffic on the Philadelphia and Erie could only move to the NYC at Erie and then to New York or Cleveland. The Oil Creek Railroad was independent, and coveted by all three trunk lines. (The PRR and NYC would join forces to detach it from the Erie system in July 1864.) Accordingly, each of the three sought to construct their own line into the oil field, to mitigate the consequences of losing the Oil Creek Railroad to a rival. The PRR chose as its vehicle the Warren and Tidioute Railroad, which had charter rights to build from the Philadelphia and Erie in Warren County southwest to Franklin. Such a railroad would naturally follow the Allegheny River southwest through Oil City on the way to Franklin. Surveys from Irvine on the Philadelphia & Erie to Oil City were made in the fall of 1863. Most of the land for the right-of-way was acquired in the following winter and spring, when its name was changed to the Warren and Franklin Railway, but due to labor and material shortages imposed by the American Civil War, construction did not begin until September 1865. Construction to Pithole As the oil boom continued, the Clarion Land and Improvement Company was chartered on August 10, 1864. The charter of this company granted it the right to extract oil or minerals or otherwise improve up to 5000 acres of land in the northwestern Pennsylvania counties of Clarion, Elk, Forest, Jefferson, Venango, Mercer, and Lawrence, and to build railroads to connect its lands with any road or navigable stream, provided that the railroad did not exceed 20 miles in length and was not broad gauge. The company was organized in December 1864. On January 7, 1865, an oil strike at the Frazier Well triggered a new oil boom along the valley of Pithole Creek, which entered the Allegheny River a few miles upstream of Oil City at Oleopolis, and led to the founding of the boomtown of Pithole, Pennsylvania. This new field, east of the existing fields in the Oil Creek valley, lacked good transportation outlets. The Clarion Land and Improvement Company obtained some scattered oil leases in the area, but its energies were focused on the construction of a railroad, as authorized by their charter, to serve the many new wells in the Pithole valley. A route was surveyed from Pithole south along Pithole Creek to Oleopolis and from there along the Allegheny to Oil City in July. It was informally named the Oil City and Pithole Branch Railroad. Construction began in August 1865. It may have been backed by the Atlantic and Great Western, which was building a new line into Oil City from the west, via Franklin. The gorge of the Allegheny offered little room for a railroad: if the Oil City and Pithole Branch Railroad occupied it first, there would be no room for the Warren and Franklin Railway to build a parallel line from Oil City to Oleopolis. Construction on the latter commenced in October, and the two railroads employed large construction forces, building towards each other at speed. The engineer of the Oil City and Pithole threatened to hold off the Warren and Franklin crew by force. In Oil City, the Warren and Franklin crew attempted to cover or tear up the roadbed being built by the Oil City and Pithole. Jacob Shirk, one of the Oil City and Pithole directors, drew a revolver and was mobbed by the opposing crew; he fled into town, where White, the leader of the Warren and Franklin work crew, was ultimately arrested and jailed. Ultimately, the Oil City and Pithole proceeded with its work and completed its line of rail into Oil City. By January 1, 1866, the line from Pithole to Oleopolis had opened. On February 7, the south end had been opened from Oil City to the Sumner and Pratt purchase, and through traffic from Oil City to Pithole commenced in early March 1866. Collapse of the boom Forman & Vandergrift and their improvements for transporting oil. The success of the construction crews was immediately followed by a series of disasters. On March 27, 1866, Charles Vernon Culver's banking companies failed, triggering an economic collapse in the oil region and a fall in oil prices. A major fire swept Oil City on May 26, 1866, and the Oil City and Pithole used freight cars to help residents evacuate their goods ahead of the fire. The Oil City and Pithole also faced a lawsuit filed in February by the Warren and Franklin, seeking to eject the Oil City and Pithole from its right-of-way along the river. The case reached the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which handed down a judgment on May 24, 1866: the Clarion Land and Improvement Company's charter gave it the right to build a railroad only as far as Oleopolis, where it reached navigable water and a connection with the Warren and Franklin. It was enjoined from interfering with the Warren and Franklin's efforts to construct and operate a railroad. The Warren and Franklin purchased the disputed line from Oil City to Oleopolis and opened its line from Irvine to Oil City on August 1, leaving the Oil City and Pithole with the 7-mile line from Pithole to Oleopolis. Oil originating at Pithole could move via the Oil City and Pithole and the Warren and Franklin to Oil City. It was not limited to further movement on the Warren and Franklin; the broad-gauge Atlantic and Great Western laid a standard-gauge rail on its track through Oil City, so oil tankers from the standard-gauge railroads could be moved to oil yards on the west side of Oil Creek and their contents transferred to broad-gauge cars. On December 10, 1866, George V. Forman was appointed sequestrator for the Oil City and Pithole. He continued to direct the operations of the railroad on behalf of creditors for several years. In the meantime, the oil wells around Pithole were rapidly fading out, and the area was becoming depopulated. Some work was done on an extension north 5 miles from Pithole to Pleasantville, where another local boom took place in 1868, but it is not clear that this was ever completed or opened. Forman joined Jacob J. Vandergrift, who had invested heavily in the Oil City and Pithole, to establish the Star Tank Line, which furnished tank cars for shipping oil from Pithole and was absorbed by Standard Oil in 1873. The two also constructed a 4-mile pipeline from West Pithole to Pithole to bring more oil traffic to the railroad. The Oil City and Pithole was sold under foreclosure on October 28, 1870. Reorganization and abandonment On May 13, 1871, the Pithole Valley Railway was organized to operate the Oil City and Pithole, now detached from the Clarion Land and Improvement Company. The Pithole Valley Railway Extension had been incorporated on February 27, 1871 to extend the line north from Pithole to Titusville, but never laid any track. Most of the officers and directors were Pennsylvanians: A. H. Steele, the president, and John A. Dale, the treasurer were both from Tionesta. However, directors S. L. M. Barlow and Charles Day were from New York. They represented the interests of the Atlantic and Great Western; Barlow was one of the American agents of James McHenry, the English financier who controlled that railroad. The Pithole Valley inherited two engines from its predecessor: a Baldwin 4-4-0 bought new in 1865, #1, and a 2-6-0T bought in 1869, #2. It bought another 4-4-0 new from Baldwin in 1871, which replaced the old #2, which was sold. Trains stopped regularly at Oleopolis, Bennett, Woods, Prathers Mill, and Pithole. The Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad was chartered in 1872, and its leadership largely overlapped with that of the Pithole Valley: Steele was president and Dale, Barlow and Day were directors. The new railroad proposed to build from Tidioute, on the Allegheny River upstream of Oleopolis, west through Titusville and northwest to the harbor at Erie to provide another outlet for the region's oil. The Pithole Valley was to be extended a short distance north of Pleasantville to reach the Pennsylvania Petroleum's main line at a point designated Colorado Junction. The project obtained the backing of the Atlantic and Great Western, which, in February 1873, leased those railroads, as well as the Shenango and Allegheny Railroad, and issued bonds secured by those lease payments to complete construction. In April, John H. Devereaux was hired by James McHenry to become general manager of the Atlantic and Great Western; he was an experienced railroad executive, and McHenry badly needed the involvement of a respectable figure to lend legitimacy to his projects. In September, he was informed by the company treasurer that the revenue from those leased line bonds had been diverted in March to pay interest on the second mortgage bonds of the Atlantic and Great Western. This lack of funds meant that construction was not completed on the Pennsylvania Petroleum and the Pithole Valley railroads. The Atlantic and Great Western's involvement with these leased lines meant that most of the Pithole Valley's officers and directors were replaced by those of the Atlantic and Great Western; Devereaux assumed the presidency, while Steele became vice-president. The misappropriate of the bond revenue testified to the particularly bad financial state of the Atlantic and Great Western, but speculative over-extension generally prevailed among American railroads. That fall, the Panic of 1873 took place as the speculative bubble collapsed, and generally deranged the state of railroad finance. The Pithole Valley had been operating at a loss for several years, and around late 1874 or February 1, 1875, the Atlantic and Great Western ceased to operate the line. It was sold at foreclosure on February 24 to satisfy a debt for railroad ties and bought by Henry S. Huidekoper, then the president of the company, for about $600, the money being furnished by Devereaux as receiver of the Atlantic and Great Western. The rolling stock (the two engines and about twelve freight cars) was removed and leased to the Shenango and Allegheny. Rails were removed from part of the line, although the corporation remained in existence, hoping for a resumption of the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad project. The remaining track was removed by 1876; the rails and the two Baldwin locomotives were sold to the Shenango and Allegheny in 1878. Bereft of track and equipment, the Pithole Valley Railway apparently continued to exist as a paper corporation. Steele re-assumed the presidency in March 1880, together with that of the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad. He held these offices as late as 1885. However, the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad was never completed, nor was the Pithole Valley Railway ever put into operation again.

In the wide-ranging conversation, which aired on HBO, the four comedians tackled subjects like race, crude language, the outside forces driving their comedy, their inspirations, and the comedy industry at large.  Cast  *Jerry Seinfeld *Chris Rock *Ricky Gervais *Louis C.K.  Content  Throughout the loose conversation the comedians debate various topics such as the merit of \\"stupid jokes\\" as well as crude language in their sets. They also compliment each other on specific bits they do. Seinfeld praised C.K.'s describing him as a comedian who \\"tap danced over six laser beams\\". C.K. described Seinfeld as a \\"singular comedian\\". He also reminisced about when he was a young comic opening for Seinfeld. Chris Rock mentions his heroes as being Prince and Woody Allen for their work ethic as they had new material every year. They also talk about the comedy industry at large, ticketing innovation, and their fears on stage.  Production  In an interview C.K. stated the initial conversation ran over 4 hours before being cut down to an hour long discussion. According to BBC the special was organized by Ricky Gervais who serves as an executive producer on the one off special.  Reception  The review aggregator website Metacritic gave the television special a 75% rating, indicating generally favorable reviews. Ben Wicks of BBC wrote, \\"Imagine Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, Don Rickles, and George Carlin all gathered in a room, circa 1979, musing wittily on the secrets of their success. This is the closest approximation to such a summit we‚Äôre gonna get\\". Critic Kevin Jagernauth from IndieWire gave a mixed review stating, \\"Neither as deep or delightful as it wants to be, ‚ÄúTalking Funny‚Äù shows us four guys having a great time hanging out with each other and makes us wish we were having as much fun watching it as they did making it.\\" Annie Barrett from Entertainment Weekly praised the show for its \\"intellectual discussion\\", and that she wished \\"wish this were a weekly series instead of a one-time special. Even a podcast would work.\\" She elaborated saying, \\"My favorite thing about the special was that these four guys have very different approaches to comedy.\\" Variety critic Brian Lowery, criticized the special for its loose nature, saying \\"[Talking Funny] isn't perceptive enough to stick in your head\\", however he praised the chemistry between the four comedians, saying \\"the special is interesting enough that again watching these four guys (or perhaps another assorted quartet) sit around bullshitting isn't an unattractive thought.\\"  References  Category:20th-century American comedians Category:20th-century American male actors Category:20th- century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American comedians Category:American stand-up comedians Category:21st-century American non- fiction writers Category:20th-century American male writers Category:American male comedians Category:American male comedy actors Category:Primetime Emmy Award winners Category:Comedians from New York City Category:American television writers ","title":"Talking Funny (television special)"},{"id":"64218654","text":"Fechtig is an unincorporated community in Hampton County, South Carolina, United States.

The winters are milder than in the cold desert to the north (the Central Asian northern desert ecoregion), and a large number of endemic species have adapted to living in the particular climate and soil of the region. As with sandy deserts in general, the region is notable for high numbers of endemic species of reptiles and insects.  Location and description  The ecoregion covers the arid territory from the Caspian Sea on the west, almost to the Pamir-Alay) Mountains to the east. Most of Turkmenistan and the eastern half of Uzbekistan is this region. Covered are the coastal plains of the Caspian, the Krasnovodsk and Ustyurt Plateaus of northwest Turkmenistan, the Karakum Desert ('Black Sand' desert) of central Turkmenistan, and the Kyzylkum Desert ('Red Sand' desert) of eastern Uzbekistan and a portion of southern Kazakhstan between the Syr Darya and Amu Darya Rivers. The ecoregion is bisected by the thin ecoregion of the Central Asian riparian woodlands of the Amu Darya River.

It has been serialized in Kodansha's Monthly Morning Two magazine since July 2016.  Plot  Coco is a kind and daydreaming daughter of a dressmaker who aspires to become a witch; however because only innate magical users can practice and use magic, she has to give up on her dream. One day she meets a Wizard named Qifrey and after she witnesses how he uses magic (by drawing magical runes and using magical ink), Coco accidentally casts a spell that turns her mother to stone. As Coco does not know which magic spell she cast and Qifrey is tracking the sinister coven that could be behind the incident, he takes Coco as his apprentice in order to undo the spell and allow her to fulfill her dream. As it is gradually revealed, the coven in question - the Brimhats - have taken an extraordinary interest in Coco, hoping that she will help them revive the free use of magic, which was outlawed because of the atrocities committed with it in past times, with some of their repercussions still enduring in Coco's world. Because rune magic can be effectively made by everyone, the Assembly carefully watches over any abuse of it, even going as so far as to erase the memories of any uninitiated (called \\"Unknowing Ones\\") when they discover this secret. Thus, as Coco immerses herself into this new, wondrous world, a sinister plot begins to thicken around her. Characters=Qifrey's Atelier ; :A bright, optimistic young half-orphan and dressmaker's daughter who dreams of becoming a witch, and sees her wish fulfilled at the horrid cost of her mother getting turned to stone. Subsequently, she is taken in by Qifrey and, instead of having her memory erased, is allowed to learn the ways of rune magic, which gains her a dubious reputation in the magic community. While initially clumsy and naive, she is very enthusiastic about learning all she can about magic, and with her background as an Unknowing One, she is able to conceive highly creative ways of using her new-found knowledge. ; :A reclusive witch and magic teacher specializing in water magic. His school is a haven for children who have magical talent but are considered outcasts because they did not - or refused to - fit into the rigid structures of the old established schools. While it is partly out of kindness that he takes Coco in, he has also taken note of the Brimhat's designs on her. In fact, he holds a very personal grudge against the Brimhats ever since his childhood, where they used him in a fell ritual that took his right eye away (which he now keeps covered by his hair). As a result of their attempts to prevent him from tracking his tormentors, he distanced himself from the Assembly, returning only for necessities. In his pursuit for vengeance, Qifrey is ruthless enough to employ forbidden mind control magic to prevent any hindrance. ; :A black-haired girl from the renowned Arclom family, one of the houses who established the vow to keep the magic arts a secret to the general populace. Agott was cast out during her test for apprenticeship when malicious rumors surfaced that the magic she was to present at her trial was someone else's. Upon becoming Qifrey's student, she became a bitter loner, obsessed with perfecting her magic skills under her own power, and distanced herself from the other students. Still, her preciceness in drawing rune circles makes her very popular with her schoolmates, who often approach her for help or advice. :Upon first meeting Coco, Agott initially treats her with scorn, even sending her off to a demanding test even though Coco had no practical experience with magic yet. However, owing to Coco's sincerity and imagination in devising new ways of employing magic, Agott gradually comes out of her shell and begins regarding Coco as a dear friend and equal, even though she is still reluctant to openly confess her feelings. ; :A bright, bubbly and constantly upbeat girl with curly hair. Her greatest desire is to create magical clouds on which people can float through the sky. ; :A gloomy, distant-looking young girl with a stubborn personality who is skilled in crystal magic and specialized in drawing very small rune circles. She became withdrawn when her beloved older brother Riliphin was the only person to appreciate her magic, and since refused to learn any new magic or submit to authority. Under Coco's encouragement and a magical test where she and her friends were imperiled by the Brimhats, she decided to move on and learn more magic to help her friends. ; :A blackhaired witch living as a partner and supervisor for the Assembly (a \\"Watchful Eye\\") at Qifrey's atelier. Despite his gruff demeanor, he is actually a caring soul, and the magical items he creates are commonly meant to increase the comfort of their users. He specializes in magic creating fire, light and heat. ; :A fluffy caterpillar-like creature who attaches itself to Coco during her test for apprenticeship (mainly due to his species' love for the smell of magical inks) and henceforth resides at Qifrey's atelier as a pet. It is frequently hinted that he has an intelligence and persona as complex as a human's. Brimhats ; :A high-ranking member - and possibly the leader - of the Brimhats, who characteristically wears a cone hat with a face mask shaped like an eye. Iguin is the one who gave Coco the spellbook which ultimately became responsible for turning her mother into stone, and it is hinted that he sees a potential in her which would allow the reintroduction of magic into everyday life. ; :A Brimhat who experimented with transformation magic which failed, giving him a feline appearance. In order to hide this, and to intimidate his victims, he has taken to remote-control an empty cloak and hat to impersonate his presence, leading to his nickname \\"Empty Cloak Witch\\". The Assembly The Assembly is the institution in Coco's world which governs the use of magic, its spreading (by regulating the enlistment and advancement of apprentices) and the maintenance of its secrecy. The seat of the Assembly is located in an underwater city called the Great Hall, which can only be reached by a certain stairwell descending into the depths of the earth, as well as special magic. ; :A dark-skinned senior witch and one of Qifrey's best friends, even after he left the Assembly to strike out on his own. ; :Known by the title \\"Sage of Instruction\\", Beldaruit is a high mage and member of the Three Sages, the Assembly's ruling council. He is disabled, forcing him to rely on a walking chair for locomotion, and likes to cloak his presence with illusions. His playful and seemingly scatter-brained personality hide a sharp intellect. He was once Qifrey's teacher and thus knows about his faults, and has offered to teach Coco to keep her out of her tutor's plotting against the Brimhats. ;Sinosia :A friendly and caring witch physician residing in the Great Hall. Because any magic directly applied to a living body - including healing magic - is considered forbidden lore, she is limited to using conventional healing methods to treat her patients. ;Couccoureaux :A disparaging, irresponsible sorcerer and Euini's former mentor. ; :Richeh's older brother. The Magic Security Council Also known as the Knights Moralis, the Security Council is subsidiary agency to the Assembly - basically, its law enforcement branch. Its members are assigned to track any abuse of magic and hunt down perpetrators and victims for memory erasure. ; :A leading member of the Knights Moralis, who is quietly stern but - contrary to some of her colleagues - very considerate. ; :A stern, by-the-book field leader of the Security Council. ; :A brash, easy-going member of the Knights Moralis. ; :A member of the Knights Moralis. ;Etran and Echo :Twin juvenile Knight apprentices who have yet to take their profession seriously. Others ; :An eldery maker of magical stationery (pens and inks) residing in the town of Karoon. ; :A young boy and apprentice to Nolnoa. He suffers from argentosis, a rare sight condition which makes him effectively colorblind and thus initially unable to use magic because certain effects rely on inks differentiated by their color. He becomes a dear friend to Coco, who helps him by teaching him magic with which to circumvent his disability. ; :A nervous young witch apprentice, and originally Couccoureaux's student. During an advancement test in which some of Qifrey's students were also participating, he is kidnapped by the Brimhats, who etch a magical sigil into his skin, permanently turning him into a scaled wolf. However, with the help of Coco, Agott and Richeh, he receives a talisman which reverses the transformation while worn. Because his tattoo makes him eligible for mind erasure by the Security Council - despite his victimization - he has gone underground with Alaira, who has become his new tutor. He has also formed a bond with Richeh, which has become her primary motivation to expand her studies in order to help him.

He won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Championships as a heavyweight, and competed at two editions of the World Championships. Amateur career Before boxing, Korving played association football in the youth systems of CVV Be Fair and VV Waddinxveen. However, a serious injury made him quit football and he eventually started boxing after doing a trial lesson. Korving represented his country in a continental competition for the first time at the 2013 European Youth Championships in Rotterdam. He moved up to the highest age group in amateur boxing, the senior division the following year. The 19-year-old immediately won a gold medal at the German Senior National Championships in the heavyweight class, defeating reigning champion Johan Visscher in the finals. After taking first at a tournament in Helsinki in March 2015, he won another gold two months later at the Algirdas Socikas Tournament in Kaunas, where he impressed by beating European Youth Championship silver medalist Adam Hamori in the semi-finals. He won two fights before falling to Tervel Pulev in the quarter-finals of that year's European Championships. He also participated in his first World Championships in Doha, but was eliminated by the eventual gold medalist, Evgeny Tishchenko, in his second bout. In March 2016, Korving won the prestigious Chemistry Cup in Germany. After a quick elimination from the 2016 European Olympic Qualification Tournament at the hands of the eventual winner Lawrence Okolie, his last chance at qualifying for the 2016 Summer Olympics was winning the 2016 World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Baku. He won his first two matches, decisions against Commonwealth Games medalists David Nyika and Efetobor Apochi, respectively, before he was defeated by Julio Castillo in the semi-finals. In 2017, he won a bronze medal at the European Championships in Kharkiv after losing his semi-final bout to Englishman Cheavon Clarke. This qualified him for another appearance at the World Championships five months later, although he lost in his second bout. In 2018, Korving defeated two-time European Championship silver medalist and international teammate Peter M√ºllenberg in the finals of the Senior National Championships. He repeated this feat the following year, decisioning Kilat Hallie for his fourth consecutive national heavyweight title. He was inducted into the 2018‚Äì2019 class of the Waddinxveen Hall of Fame. In April 2019, after 111 official amateur bouts, a 23-year-old Korving suddenly retired from the sport. He cited the difficulty of balancing boxing with his work as a fireman with the Royal Netherlands Air Force at Woensdrecht Air Base, as well as frustration with the NOC*NSF over a lack of financial support.

The treaty concluded the Poor Conrad revolt against Ulrich and annulled his recent taxes on the populace of the Duchy, while the Estates of his realm agreed to liquidate his substantial debts. Background W√ºrttemberg was a minor state in the Holy Roman Empire that had existed as a County from the late 11th century. Its rulers grew increasingly powerful over the Middle Ages by accumulating territory in Swabia and Imperial rights. By the 1270s, it was able to scuttle the efforts of the first Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph I, to restore the Duchy of Swabia. After acquiring Teck, seat of the defunct Duke of Teck and formerly a possession of the House of Z√§hringen, W√ºrttemberg had a case for elevation to ducal status. In 1495, at the Diet of Worms, Emperor Maximilian I made W√ºrttemberg a Duchy in what would be the final such elevation of an Imperial Count to a title other than \\"Prince\\" (F√ºrst). Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor from 1440 to 1493, made extensive reform to the medieval structure of the Holy Roman Empire by politically reorganizing it. One such reorganization was the ordering of its princes, prelates, and cities into the Imperial Estates, which shared power with the Emperor. This would be mirrored in several of its territories, like W√ºrttemberg, which established its own Estates in 1457. The Count at the time of W√ºrttemberg's elevation to ducal status was Eberhard V, who had reunited the County in 1480 after it had divided between two branches of the House of W√ºrttemberg. Eberhard V died in 1495, leaving the Duchy ‚àí and 300,000 florins of debt ‚àí to his cousin, Duke Eberhard II. Eberhard was not popular or a skilled administrator and was deposed in March 1498 by the personal intervention of Maximilian I. This left a nine-year-old, Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. The Estates formed a four-man regency council to rule for Ulrich until Maximilian I declared Ulrich of age in 1503, violating the 1492 's stipulation that the Duke reached majority at age 20. The young Duke opened his reign with a successful campaign during the War of the Succession of Landshut, but also began accumulating massive debts. By 1514, the Duchy owed more than a million florins. To repay that debt Ulrich legislated a 6% wealth tax, which was so unpopular it never passed into law, and then an indirect tax on consumables that badly affected the Duchy's lower classes. The 1514 Poor Conrad revolt was one of the Bundschuh peasant revolts in southwest Germany between 1493 and 1517. Aftermath Coat of arms of the city of T√ºbingen, with the Landsknecht arms bearing stag antlers Until its annulment in 1805, the Treaty of T√ºbingen acted as a kind of written constitution for the Duchy. The treaty, which transformed the Estates of the Duchy into a check on ducal power, was for a time regarded by scholars as a \\"W√ºrttemberger Magna Carta\\", though this comparison has been discredited. Theologian and historian Hellmut G. Haasis described the treaty as being a \\"shambles\\" (\\"Schandwerk\\") that made no real progress toward a democratic state. Because of T√ºbingen's role in ending the Poor Conrad revolt, Ulrich awarded the city the right to bear the Ducal stag antlers on its coat of arms above its blazon on 18 August 1514.

Ideraabdullah explores how maternal nutrition and environmental toxin exposure affect development through exploring epigenetic changes to DNA. She has found that maternal Vitamin D deficiencies can cause genome-wide changes in methylation patterns that persist for several generations and impact offspring health. Her international collaboration with the University of Witwatersrand represents the first time that metal levels in the placenta have been investigated in relation to birth outcomes in South Africa.  Early life and education  Ideraabdullah wanted to be a scientist from a young age. It was in her high school biology class that she learned that DNA is the blueprint for biology, and this idea fascinated her. She wanted to understand how this blueprint could generate and sustain a healthy organism, and became dedicated to science ever since. In 1997, Ideraabdullah pursued her undergraduate studies at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania. She majored in Biology with a concentration in Genetics and explored undergraduate research opportunities in the lab of Andrew Clark. She conducted genetics research in Drosophila, which spearheaded a continued career in genetics. Ideraabdullah graduated in 2001 with a Bachelors of Science. Following her undergraduate degree, Ideraabdullah moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to conduct her graduate research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2002. She worked under the mentorship of Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena in the Department of Genetics. She explored genetic diversity through a clear evolutionary framework. Her first work in the lab helped to elucidate the sequence diversity of 20 inbred mouse strains based on substitutions, insertions, and deletions. She found that deletions are more frequent than insertions and that sequence diversity is about two orders of magnitude higher among these strains than within the human population. Her thesis worked explored the genetic architecture of DDK syndrome and the genetic basis for embryonic lethality in mice. She found that the maternal and paternal components of the DDK syndrome are non-allelic based on characterizing the candidate intervals for the gene encoding the maternal and paternal factors. She also characterized the genetic modifiers that lead to a rescue phenotype for DDK syndrome. Ideraabdullah completed her graduate training in 2007. Following her graduate training, Ideraabdullah pursued postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Marisa Bartolomei at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Here, Ideraabdullah gained expertise in the study of epigenetics. She studied the molecular mechanisms of genomic imprinting, where gene expression is dependent on whether the gene was inherited from the mother or the father. Since regulation of imprinted genes was thought to be governed by the epigenetic modifications to the imprinting control region (ICR), Ideraabdullah explored whether there are regions outside the ICR that are important in the regulation of imprinted genes. She mutated different regions within the ICR for H19/IGF2 and this caused a loss of repression of the imprinted gene, yet the methylation patterns at the imprinted gene‚Äôs ICR and promoter region did not change. Her findings were the first to suggest that mechanisms outside the ICR are necessary to mediate the fully repressed state of an imprinted gene. Following this finding, Ideraabdullah generated and characterized a mouse model of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), a disorder caused by aberrations in gene imprinting. Using this tool, she explored how microdeletions in the imprinting control region for H19/IGF2 cause dysregulation of epigenetic marks and imprinted gene expression. She found that the deletion did not perturb DNA methylation, though it did impact gene repression and further that the impacts of the deletion on insulator function are tissue specific, in that only mesodermal tissues have disrupted insulator function. Ideraabdullah completed her postdoctoral training in 2012.  Career and research  In 2013, Ideraabdullah joined the Department of Genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as an Assistant Professor. She holds a joint appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Gillings School of Global Public Health and she is an Affiliate Member of the Nutrition Research Institute in Kannapolis, North Carolina. As of 2016, Ideraabdullah became an Honorary Researcher at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa within the MRC/Wits Developmental Pathways for Health Research Unit. Ideraabdullah is also a member of the Genetics Society of America. Ideraabdullah is the principal investigator of the Ideraabdullah Lab which studies the mechanisms by which the epigenome is modified by the environment during development. Her lab has a focus on investigating the epigenetic impacts of vitamin D deficiency, pesticide exposure, and hyperglycemia during pregnancy.  Nutritional impact on epigenetic landscape  One form of epigenetic modification is methylation, and thus methyl donor nutrients play a critical role in epigenetic modifications. Ideraabdullah was interested in exploring how maternal intake of methyl donors affects development of offspring. She found that the additive effects of a low methyl diet plus antibiotic treatment led to altered pup body weight, litter size and litter success. Vitamin D is another critical nutrient for methylation, and vitamin D deficiency is a global problem with unknown impacts on maternal and child health. Ideraabdullah explored how maternal vitamin D deficiency alters the methylation and imprinted loci. She found that deficiencies in vitamin D in mothers led to altered body weight and loss of DNA methylation in two subsequent generations of offspring in both somatic and germline tissues. To follow this study, Ideraabdullah‚Äôs team explored the genome-wide methylation patterns in mouse sperm in controls versus developmentally vitamin D depleted animals. They found that developmental depletion of vitamin D led to loss of methylation epimutations in regions enriched for developmental and metabolic genes. Overall, Ideraabdullah has established that vitamin D deficiency had substantial effects on epigenetic modifications to the adult male germline that span several generations.  Soweto first 1000 days cohort  Ideraabdullah collaborates with the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa to assess how high exposure to metal affects birth outcomes. Their first study in 2019 explored if metal levels in the placenta of this cohort were related to birth outcomes. They established that the cohort had higher cadmium levels than global cohort measurements, and lower essential elements such as nickel and chromium. They found that cadmium, selenium, and nickel were all related to placenta and birth outcomes and they are currently investigating the mechanisms by which this correlation manifests.

Photo by Koh Nguang How. The 5th Passage Artists Limited, commonly known as 5th Passage or 5th Passage Artists, was an artist- run initiative and contemporary art space in Singapore from 1991 to 1994. As a registered, artist-led non-profit organisation, it was one of the earliest of its kind for early-1990s Singapore, with its initial space located at Parkway Parade, a shopping centre in the east of the city. The \\"meteoric existence\\" of 5th Passage has been noted alongside other art collectives and alternative spaces existing in 1990s Singapore, such as The Artists Village, The Substation, Plastique Kinetic Worms, and Trimurti. 5th Passage was co-founded in 1991 by Suzann Victor, Susie Lingham, and Han Ling, later joined by Daniel Wong, Henry Tang and Iris Tan. The initiative's programming emphasised an interdisciplinary approach‚Äîit exhibited performance art, installation, music, photography, and design, also organising public readings and forums. Art critic Lee Weng Choy describes 5th Passage as an initiative that had \\"focussed on issues of gender and identity, and on the work of women artists\\". Preceding Amanda Heng's Women in the Arts (WITA) collective formed in 1999, 5th Passage could be considered an early non-institutional platform for contemporary feminist art practices in 1990s Singapore. Within the history of Singapore's contemporary art, 5th Passage is often associated with its role in staging the 1994 performance work by Josef Ng, Brother Cane. Sensationalised media coverage of the performance led to a ten-year suspension of funding for unscripted performance art in Singapore, and the eviction of 5th Passage from Parkway Parade.  History = Origins  In 1991, Singaporean artist Victor approached the corporate company that managed the Parkway Parade shopping centre, to enquire about a space to display art. She was offered a two-year, rent-free lease for the fifth-floor passageway between the Office Tower Block and the car park, which she proposed to turn into a contemporary art space. The initiative was thus named for the fifth-floor passageway that it occupied. Victor and Lingham would meet with Singaporean art critic T.K. Sabapathy, who served as an adviser to 5th passage, to discuss the objectives of their organisation. They sought to run the organisation without support from public bodies so other fundraising projects were organised, which included setting up stalls at shopping centres to sell artists' work. Structurally, 5th Passage did not impose a clear hierarchy between administrators and artists, with individuals taking on both roles. The initiative was envisioned as a platform for emerging artists at the time, exhibiting artists such as John Clang. 5th Passage also organised 12-hour long events that included local musicians and writers such as Stella Kon, Gopal Baratham and Philip Jeyaretnam. With their location at a crowded shopping centre, 5th Passage aimed to bring art directly to urban Singapore. This contrasted with another significant Singapore artist-run initiative, The Artists Village, which was located at a rural kampong area in Ulu Sembawang from 1988 to 1990. Victor's artist biography describes 5th Passage as having: It was usual for Singaporean artists returning from a Euro-American art education overseas to inform other Singapore-based artists about ongoing international developments in art, as exemplified in the late 1980s by artist Tang Da Wu and his helming of The Artists Village, TAV, or earlier in the 1970s with the group of artists managing Singapore's Alpha Gallery, which included Choy Weng Yang, for instance. Significantly, none of the artists involved in co-founding 5th Passage had been overseas for studies, and are self-described by Lingham as being literal \\"home-grown\\" artists.  The Artists' General Assembly From 26 December 1993 to 1 January 1994, the Artists' General Assembly, AGA, was held at the 5th Passage art space, an arts festival that the initiative co-organised with The Artists Village. During the 12-hour AGA New Year‚Äôs Eve show from 31 December 1993 to 1 January 1994, Josef Ng staged a performance work, Brother Cane, in protest at the arrest of 12 homosexual men during anti-gay operations in 1993, whose personal details were published in local mainstream newspapers. During the final minutes of the performance, Ng turned his back to the audience and trimmed his pubic hair, a moment photographed by The New Paper. Media coverage of the performance portrayed this as an obscene act. Following the public outcry, 5th Passage was charged with breaching the conditions of its Public Entertainment License, blacklisted from funding by Singapore's National Arts Council, and evicted from its Parkway Parade site. This was despite 5th Passage having secured the necessary permits and licences, and setting up audience advisory notices for the performances. Iris Tan, as the gallery manager of the 5th Passage, was prosecuted by the Singapore High Court alongside Ng. Described as one of the \\"darkest moments of Singapore‚Äôs contemporary art scene\\", the incident led to a ten-year no-funding rule for performance art, a ruling lifted only in 2003. In 1994, 5th Passage received a ten-month offer to curate shows at vacant shop units in the Pacific Plaza shopping centre, which the initiative took up. Here, Victor produced works such as a performative installation that grieved for the silencing of 5th Passage and all Singapore artists. Around a year after 5th Passage's programmes at Pacific Plaza, the founder-directors of the initiative left for further studies and the group disbanded.  Present-day  While 5th Passage is now considered defunct, the initiative continues to be consistently invoked as a significant artist-run initiative within the history of Singapore's contemporary art. 5th Passage is very often referenced in relation to the controversial 1994 Brother Cane performance and the subsequent decade-long suspension of funding for performance art in Singapore. Scholarship in 2019 notes the contrasting trajectories for 5th Passage and The Artists Village: While 5th Passage was essentially \\"rendered [the] scapegoat\\" with little data about the initiative circulating, \\"the persons of interest from TAV have since literally moved on and upward in the artworld\\". Pioneering Singaporean performance artist, Lee Wen, who was closely involved with The Artists Village's activities, would touch upon this disparity in 2013, apologising to Victor and Lingham in a written blog post: The initiative's artistic director, Victor and co-founder, Lingham, have continued to play significant roles within Singapore's contemporary art landscape. Noted for her installations, Victor was one of four artists selected to represent Singapore at its first national pavilion in 2001 at the 49th Venice Biennale, and as of 2020, remains the only woman artist to have shown at the Singapore Pavilion for the art biennale in Venice. From 2013 to 2015, Lingham would serve as the Director of the Singapore Art Museum, later taking on the role of Creative Director for the 5th Singapore Biennale in 2016. In 2019, the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival selected \\"Still Waters\\" as its theme, a direct reference to a 1998 performance by Victor. The work, Still Waters (between estrangement and reconciliation), was performed at the Singapore Art Museum, a rare publicly- staged performance work between 1994 to 2003, described by Victor as a work responding to the de facto performance art ban and the loss of the 5th Passage space.

He was one among the first princely officials to join the Odia unification movement and the Utkal Sabha. Biography Atharuddin Mohammed was born as the eldest son of Khwaja Pir Fazal Mohammed, a notable Persian philosopher and mystic of the Ni'matullƒÅhƒ´ order who later joined the service of Raja Bhagiratha Mahendra, the Raja of Denkanal. Fazal Mohammed was appointed as the Samanta of Madhi garh presently known as Kamakhyanagar and after his death, his son Atharuddin took over the position. Athar rose to prominence in the eyes of the king by displaying his bravery and wit. He was appointed as the Dewan by the newly crowned king, Raja Dinabandhu Mahendra in 1877. During his tenure Atharuddin organised the last elephant fair in Odisha. With the beginning of the Praja Mandal movement in Dhenkanal State, the peasants all over the kingdom started revolting against the repressive policies adopted by the new king, Raja Shura Pratap Bahadur. Atharuddin tried to pacify the situation by signing a temporary truce with the revolters. However, it did not last long. Inspired by the nationalists, he sent his son Sayeed Mohammed to Cuttack to attain formal education. Later in 1899, Atharuddin moved to Cuttack and joined the Utkal Sabha. He along with Madhusudan Das, Rev Shem Sahu, John Samson Rout, Bhagaban Chandra Das, Ramesh Chandra Mandal, and Gauri Shankar Ray attended the Congress sessions held at different places and a took keen interest in the activities of the Congress in its early years. Atharuddin acted as a pioneer in bringing the message of Congress and its liberal ideas to Coastal Odisha in the last two decades against the British authorities. He built the Fazal Mohammed Masjid (present- day Choti Masjid) in the memory of his deceased father near his residence at Dargaah Bazaar. He also donated lands for building jails in Cuttack.

History  Counterpropaganda such as leaflets, broadsheets (such as the first pages of the ), brochures, posters, and clandestine newspapers began to appear in France. In September 1941, German police in Paris reported discovering leaflets written in German and co-signed by the Communist Parties of Germany (KPD) and Austria (KP√ñ). On 10 July 1942, General Karl Oberg posted a notice in every town hall in the Occupied zone announcing penalties applicable to the families of anyone convicted of disseminating propaganda against the occupying force (writers, typographers, middlemen, distributors), recalling ancient German Sippenhaft-style collective punishment measures. These measures didn't stop the spread of information by the Resistance, and by 1944, 1,200 underground newspaper titles were being published with a total circulation of two million copies, totaling nearly twelve million copies over the course of the war. The first French underground newspapers emerged in opposition to German and Vichy control over French radio and newspapers. In the German-occupied zone, the first underground titles to emerge were Pantagruel and Libre France, which both began in Paris in October 1940. In Vichy France, the first title to emerge was Libert√© in November 1940. Few produced issues for both German and Vichy zones, though Lib√©ration was an early exception. In early newspaper issues, individuals often wrote under a number of pseudonyms in the same issue to convey the impression that a team of individuals was working on a newspaper. Initially underground newspapers represented a wide range of political opinions but, by 1944, had generally converged in support of Gaullist Free French in the United Kingdom. Cover of first edition of Le Silence de la Mer by Jean Bruller (1942) The four major clandestine newspapers during the German occupation were D√©fense de la France, R√©sistance, Combat and Lib√©ration. D√©fense de la France was founded by a group of parisian students in the summer of 1941. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, these were joined by a number of communist publications including L'Humanit√© and Verit√©. These newspapers were anti-Nazi propaganda, but practiced propaganda themselves by misreporting events, and glorifying and enlarging Allied victories. The reporting in these newspapers was often subjective, as they aimed to capture and shape public opinion rather than accurately represent it. The extent to which underground newspapers actually affected French popular opinion under the occupation is disputed by historians. Profession-specific newspapers also existed. Le M√©decin Fran√ßais advised doctors to immediately approve known collaborators for Service du travail obligatoire while medically disqualifying everyone else. La Terre advised farmers on how to send food to resistance members. Bulletin des Chemins de Fer encouraged railroad workers to sabotage German transportation. Unter Uns (\\"Among Us\\"), published in German for the occupiers, printed stories of German defeats on the eastern front. A small number of underground presses were also active in printing illegal books and works of literature. The most notable example of this was Le Silence de la mer by Jean Bruller published illegally in Paris in 1942. Its publisher, \\"Les √âditions de Minuit\\", became a successful commercial literary publisher in post-war France. The Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF) began a project in 2012 to digitise surviving French underground newspapers. By 2015, 1,350 titles had been uploaded on its Gallica platform.  Censorship and repression  Censorship in France was the enemy of the underground press during the Second World War. Under the German occupation and the laws of the Vichy regime, freedoms of the French people were suppressed, particularly with the end of freedom of the press. The decree-law of 24 August 1939 authorising seizure of newspapers and their suppression as well as the official establishment of censorship on 27 August led to the disappearance of newspapers which had been denouncing the German occupation. The only media that survived under the occupation were ones that served the propaganda needs of the German occupier and of Vichy. It also spelled the end of freedom of speech, and any citizen caught reading the foreign press or listening to foreign radio were judged as opponents and enemies of the regime. The occupying force and the police paid particular attention to counterpropaganda printed matter from the outset. One of the first missions of the police was to discover clandestine newspaper printing locations, and their leaders. The first arrests were therefore those of journalists involved in counterpropaganda such as Jean-Baptiste Lebas, who launched \\"\\" (The Free Man) and who died after being deported, or Claude Bourdet, director of the clandestine newspaper Combat arrested in March 1944. Out of 1200 workers 400 were killed (deported, decapitated, shot).  Printing and distribution methods  In the face of repression, underground newspapers faced many problems with supplies. Paper, ink and typewriters were scarce, expensive and their sale was meticulously controlled. Printing centres were also few and far between and were used for propaganda newspapers. The first clandestine newspapers were therefore handwritten with very few copies. However, two processes were useful for clandestine production: the \\"roneo\\" Gestetner and the spirit duplicator, which was small in size and therefore easy to transport and hide. It was operated by a small crank handle, and could print between 700 and 800 copies per hour. Everything was done with the utmost secrecy governments and also of people not involved in the clandestine work. The penalties for being involved in the printing and distribution of a resistance newspaper were very strict. For the delivery and distribution of newspapers, Resistance members assumed the risk of being arrested and imprisoned. From the beginning, railway workers played an essential role in long-distance transport. The bicycle was also one of the best means of transport for delivering printed material. Other means were also used to distribute newspapers, allowing the anonymity of the distributors to be maintained: slipping the issues into letterboxes, under doors, or in a pocket, or dropping them on a bench or table. In spite of strong repression and censorship nearly 1200 titles totaling over ten million copies of underground newspapers were printed between 1940 and 1944.  Radio Londres and the underground press  General Charles de Gaulle at his desk in London during the War After the Fall of France in 1940, the BBC opened its studio to the first members of the Resistance who fled Occupied France. was born and would become the daily rendezvous of the French people for four years. It opened its transmission with, \\"\\" (\\"This is London. The French speaking to the French...\\"), now a very famous quote in France. It was the voice of Free French Forces under Charles de Gaulle, who, on 18 June 1940, made his famous Appeal of 18 June, inviting his compatriots to resist the occupation, and rise up against it. The press was constrained on French territory to considerable supply difficulties and strong political repression. Radio, which broadcast mainly from abroad, was not subject to the same forms of repression. Radio Londres, broadcast by the French section of the BBC seemed better placed to make the voice of the French Resistance heard and to have a psychological influence on the French. Its broadcasts could be listened to both throughout the country and within the homes themselves, but in 1940 there were only five million receivers and the transistor hadn't yet been invented. Moreover, the broadcasts only provided a view of events from the outside, and had limited knowledge of what was happening within French territory. Radio London and the clandestine newspapers thus had complementary functions in their common objective of bringing as many French people as possible to the Resistance. The radio was able to reach the entirety of the French population, while the press had the mission of fighting directly on the home front until it was able to spread more and more to the territory as a whole.  Calling for resistance  The content of clandestine newspapers focused exclusively on the motivations and nature of the Resistance struggle, and why it was necessary. The duty to act is clearly stated in the first issue of Lib√©ration of July 1941 which stated that the newspaper per se is an action and that the situation can only be changed \\"by action and through action\\". Combat followed it by giving in January 1942 \\"guidelines for action\\". Plaque in Quimper commemorating a January 1944 act of sabotage against the STO office, destroying 44,000 files. There was only one cause common to all underground newspapers: to appeal to as many French people as possible to join the fight against the occupier, to \\"chase away the invader\\" as Lib√©ration wrote in August 1941, with the aim of liberating French territory. The first form of action targeted by the underground press was the call to read and circulate copies of the clandestine press. It also encouraged the reader to become a distributor. It was a form of \\"combat through words\\", as Combat wrote in December 1941. The situation at the time only allowed for resistance via verbal struggle. \\"We will take part in the crushing of Germany, even at the risk of our own lives,\\" wrote the August 1941 issue of '''' The clandestine press worked to counter the ideas of the Vichy regime and Nazis by taking up the key themes of the official propaganda. By 1943, the watchwords of the counterpropaganda struggle taken up by all of the underground press, were opposing the Service du travail obligatoire, the Nazi-imposed obligatory work program, and calling for demonstrations, strikes and sabotage of French-made goods destined for Germany.  Top-circulation titles = Combat  The (\\"Little Wings\\") appeared in the Forbidden Zone in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. In the Occupied and Free zones, it becamee known as . In August 1941, its title changed: in the northern, Occupied zone, to ; in the southern zone, to (Truth). The group in the north was destroyed. In the south, during the merger of the (MLN) with the Resistance group, became , a new newspaper common to all three zones; its title was adopted by the MLN group, thenceforth known as , whose first issue came out in December 1941 under the influence of and Henri Frenay. Production of was directed by Andr√© Bollier. Thanks to the structures put in place, circulation reached 1000 copies in 1943, and attained 5,000 with issue number 50 of 1 November 1943. and 30,000 in December 1943. After the Liberation, was led by Albert Ollivier, , and especially Pascal Pia, who dragged his friend Albert Camus there in the fall of 1943. Jean-Paul Sartre, Andr√© Malraux, and Emmanuel Mounier also contributed, and later Raymond Aron and .  D√©fense de la France  Issue of 15 December 1943 A few Parisian students decided to found a clandestine newspaper to denounce the occupation of France. Benefiting from the support of industrialists and printers, the young Resistance fighters managed to produce an increasingly professional newspaper which ended up having the highest circulation of any underground paper as of January 1944. The first issues were printed on a Rotaprint offset press hidden in the cellar of the Sorbonne, to which H√©l√®ne Viannay held the key as a volunteer fire fighter, with the following sentence from Blaise Pascal: \\"I only believe stories whose witnesses would have their throats cut\\". Initially focused on non-violent action, the Resistance segued into armed operations in 1944. Despite setbacks dealt by the German and French police, managed to print both its newspaper and those of other movements until the Liberation. Among the printers were , who was arrested in 1944, deported, and died in Lager Ellrich, a subcamp of Mittelbau- Dora concentration camp on 23 January 1945, and his son-in-law Robert, who died 27 December 1944 in the same subcamp. After Liberation, from 8 August on, the paper was printed in Rennes, on the presses of the newspaper Ouest-France, presenting itself as the \\"evening daily of the \\". Distributed by the networks Combat and T√©moignage chr√©tien in Grenoble, Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon and Bretagne, D√©fense de la France became the underground paper with the highest circulation, with 450,000 copies per day as of January 1944. In March 1944, after multiple moves, the newspaper was housed in a three-story industrial building on rue Jean-Dolent, behind La Sant√© Prison in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, with \\"Big Margot\\", a six-ton \\"double-jesus\\" machine, a linotype, a paper cutter, and a supply of paper, gasoline, food, water and two tons of coal for the foundry.  Le Franc-Tireur  Franc-Tireur was a movement of the French Resistance founded in Lyon in November 1940 under the name , and renamed in December 1941. is also the name of the movement's underground newspaper, which printed thirty-seven issues between December 1941 and August 1944. It became one of the chief newspapers of the Resistance, and continued to be published until 1957 after being renamed \\"Franc-Tireur\\" at Liberation, with the motto: \\"In the vanguard of the Republic.\\" From 1957 to 1959, it had the title and then from 1959 to 1972. MUR (February. 1944) The leader of the movement was . Under the aegis of Jean Moulin, the movement merged with Lib√©ration-sud and Combat to create the new Mouvements Unis de la R√©sistance (MUR). is a movement in the southern zone that has the most roots in Lyon. Founded in 1941 by a group of men from various backgrounds, it is a movement of personalities with the same political sensitivity, opposition to the armistice and, from the outset, to the Marshal P√©tain himself. = Birth of the movement = The initiators of the movement met at home or during card games at the Caf√© . The first members were , member of the Young Republic League political party and left-wing Catholic, , former city councillor, , and , former communists turned radicals. They and a few others got together at the end of November 1940 and founded a movement they called \\"\\" whose mission was to fight against government propaganda and to mobilize against defeat and the authoritarian order which was taking hold. The group began by writing leaflets against the Nazis and P√©tain, which were limited to small numbers of hand- typed copies due to lack of funds. = Birth of the paper = The group had its first wave of success with the arrival of Jean-Pierre L√©vy, an Alsatian refugee who brought a ron√©o in the spring of 1941 and launched the idea of expanding its influence by publishing a real newspaper. With the support of the printer , 6000 copies of the first issue were published in December 1941. They were printed on four pages of 21 x 27.5 cm (8 1/2 x 11 inch) format. The title \\"Franc-Tireur\\" is an allusion to the groups of volunteers who formed outside the normal military framework to defend their country and the Republic in the Franco-Prussian War. The tone of articles was humorous (the newspaper's ironic subtitle was, \\"monthly as far as possible, and by the grace of the Marshal's Police\\". then \\"monthly in spite of the Gestapo and the Vichy police\\" and took an offensive tone against the Marshal and the Germans. The main themes were opposition to the new order and the occupying Germans, denunciation of their misdeeds, and the call to resistance by all people of good will. Issue number one ended with the words, \\"There is only one task: to resist, to organize.\\".  L'Humanit√©  Article in the newspaper L'Humanit√© of 24 November 1944. On 27 August 1939, the √âdouard Daladier government banned publication of L'Humanit√© after it approved the German-Soviet Pact. L'Humanit√© then appeared clandestinely for five years (383 issues of 200,000 copies) and refrained from attacking the Germans until August 1940. Many of its journalists and manufacturing staff perished in the struggle against the Nazi occupier, such as Gabriel P√©ri (responsible for an international column, shot on 15 December 1941 at the Fort Mont-Val√©rien, and . The newspaper reappeared openly once more on 21 August 1944, during the Liberation of Paris.

It was entirely written by Father Gaston Fessard. \\"Christian Testimony\\" was originally due to be called \\"Catholic Testimony\\", but due to ecumenism and following the participation of Protestants in the secret cell initially made up of Jesuits theologians from the Theologate of Fourvi√®re (Lyon), the adjective \\"Catholic\\" was changed to \\"Christian\\".

Biography  Smetius was born in Aachen to Johann Smith of Kettenis, a textile merchant, and Mary Raets of Karken. In 1605, he began his studies with Johannes Pontanus, professor of physics and mathematics at the University of Harderwijk. He returned to Aachen in 1612 and found work as a Protestant minister. Following the Siege of Aachen, he left to study at the Academy of Sedan. He assumed the position as a lecturer of philosophy in 1615. He declined an appointment to the Academy of Saumur, preferring to follow his parents to Nijmegen in 1617. He began to preach at Saint Stephen's Church. Smetius developed a fascination with Roman artifacts. Much of his spare time and money was spent collecting and studying Roman archaeology in and around the city. He also cultivated a passion for Latin poetry. During the 1620s, the excavation of tuff foundations around Nijmegen revealed many Roman era antiques. This abundance of Roman finds enabled Smetius to lay an important foundation for his archaeological collection, known thereafter as the Smetius Collection. The residents of Nijmegen knew of his interest in antique objects and offered him finds found during excavations and construction work. His collection grew to contain 10,000 Roman coins, thousands of which had been previously undocumented, and around 4,500 miscellaneous artifacts. Smetius opened his collection for public viewing, attracting many distinguished visitors such as Johannes Gronovius, Nicolaas Heinsius, Constantijn Huygen, Franciscus Junius, Johannes Pontanus, and Claudius Salmasius.Hendrik Brunsting (2003) Johannes Smetius als provinciaal-Romeins archeoloog (= Museumstukken 1). Vereniging van Vrienden van het Museum Kam, Nijmegen 1989. Smetius' hobby of collecting antiquities was not unique at this time. It was quite common among the wealthy citizens of the Dutch Republic to build a private collection of Roman antiquities out of hobby or learned interest. Such a collection served as a status object for many people, but Smetius built his collection out of pure scientific interest. He selected not so much on the basis of rarity or beauty, but on the basis of historical value for the city of Nijmegen. Partly for this reason, Smetius is often seen as a pioneer in scientific archaeology in Nijmegen. With Lambert Goris, Smetius started the , which was a precursor to the old University of Nijmegen. On May 30, 1651, Smetius became unwell during his sermons and died later that day. He was buried with his parents at Saint Stephen's Church, where he had been active as a minister since 1618. Lambert Goris was the orator at his funeral. Legacy Tomb of Johannes Smetius and his parents at the Saint Stephen's Church, Nijmegen After his death, his collection, apart from a number of pieces that were donated to the city of Nijmegen, was purchased by Johann Wilhelm and relocated to D√ºsseldorf. The collection was slowly dismantled, and it is no longer possible to find the original pieces. Smetius was survived by a son, Johannes Smetius (1630 - 1710). The Smetiusstraat in downtown Nijmegen was named after him.  Select publications  *Oppidum Batavorum seu Noviomagum liber singularis, published in 1644, contains research on the origin of the Batavians. The opinion of Cluwer and other geographers was that the city of cited by Tacitus (Hist. V, 19) was Batenborch, a fortress located near the right bank of the Meuse, one league below Ravejleyn. Smetius argued that this city is Nijmegen. *Thesaurus antiquarius seu Smetianus, sive notitia elegantissim√¶ supellectilis Roman√¶ et rarissim√¶ Pinacothec√¶, etc., published in 1658, contains the description of his collection. It was reprinted with additions by his son in 1678, under the title of Antiquitates Noviomagenses, sive notitia rarissimarum rerum antiquarum quas in veteri Batavorum oppido comparaverunt J.

Allyship is part of the anti-oppression or anti-racist conversation, which puts into use social justice theories and ideals. Allyship can exist in terms of racism, ableism, xenophobia, or other types of oppression. Outcomes of allyship considered to be desirable by proponents include greater inclusion in the workplace and empowerment of outgroups. Behaviors that are part of allyship include activism, changing to more inclusive use of language, and combating forms of prejudice against perceived outgroups such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism and other forms of discrimination.  Praxis in different fields  Allyship is enacted in a range of areas of public and private life. One may therefore speak of a praxis of allyship among librarians, museum educators, social justice workers, social media users, university faculty, and more.

The libretto Wagner was motivated by his enthusiasm for the Romeo and Juliet symphony of Hector Berlioz to create a libretto which might serve for a production at the Paris Op√©ra, with music perhaps to be written by Berlioz Warrack (1979), p. 112 or by himself. The draft, which is mostly in prose, was written between December 1849 and March 1850.Millington (1992), p. 322 It was published as an appendix to Wagner's essay The Art-Work of the Future as an example of the ideals to which such art-works should aspire - \\"a glorious Saga which long ago the raw, uncultured Folk of old-time Germany indited for no other reason than that of inner, free, Necessity\\".Wagner (1993), p. 210 However it was never set as an opera by Wagner or any other composer before Bella. The opera Oskar Schlemm adapted Wagner's outline to a full libretto (in German) for Bella, who wrote the music for it between 1880 and 1890, during which period he was living in Sibiu (now in Romania). The opera was eventually produced in Bratislava at the Slovak National Theatre on 28 April 1926, conducted by Oskar Nedbal, in a Slovak translation by Vladimir Roy, under the title Kov√°ƒç Wieland.Elschek (2003), p. 265Jur√≠k (1998) p. 36 This was the first ever staging of an original opera in Slovak.

Story The original legend of Wieland is told in Old Norse sources such as V√∂lundarkvi√∞a (a poem in the Poetic Edda) and √ûi√∞reks saga. In them, Wieland is a smith, one of three brothers who had married swan maidens. Wieland is enslaved by a king. He takes revenge by killing the king's sons and then escapes by crafting a winged cloak and flying away. In Wagner's libretto, Schwanhilde is the daughter of a marriage between a mortal woman and a fairy king, who forbids his wife to ask about his origins; on her asking him he vanishes. Schwanhilde and her sisters are however able to fly as swans. But wounded by a spear, Schwanhilde falls to earth and is rescued by the master-craftsman Wieland, and marries him, putting aside her wings and her magic ring of power. Wieland's enemies, the Neidings, under Princess Bathilde, steal the ring, kidnap Schwanhilde and destroy Wieland's home. When Wieland searches for Schwanhilde, they entrap and cripple him.

During his early years as a curate he suffered a crisis following the death of his first child. One of his parishioners suggested he study a volume of sermons by the Rev John Hill. As he read his well-being improved and he started to question some of the doctrinal beliefs in the Church of England. He shared these ideas with his congregation, causing a split in the community and was asked by his rector to leave. Within a few years he became a Baptist minister and the pastor of John Street Chapel in Bloomsbury, where he remained for thirty years. After his death it was said of him that, he was to be admired in almost everything except his Nonconformity. Father Evans‚Äô father was Rev James Evans, who attended Wadham College, Oxford (matriculated 1777). In 1782 he was appointed rector of South Reston, Lincolnshire and from 1783 he was sharing duties with his brother, Rev John Evans, as the curates for the Wiltshire parishes of Teffont Evias, Fovant, Hindon and Pertwood. At about this same time he was also appointed the head of the Salisbury City-grammar School. He later became the domestic chaplain to the Earl of Malmesbury; the master of the grammar school in the Close, Salisbury, and one of the vicars‚Äô choral of Salisbury Cathedral. He lost his first wife Sarah Evans in 1804, and remarried the same year to Mary Ann Cooper, daughter of a linen draper. He died in 1825 and is buried with his first wife in the north transept of Salisbury Cathedral, commemorated by a white tablet on the east wall. His sister was Elizabeth, who married the Rev Isaac Hodgson, the curate of Bramshott, Hampshire. James Harington Evans, the early years James Harington Evans was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire on the 15 April 1785 and baptised October 1786. His father was head of the Salisbury City-grammar School and it was there that young Evans received his early education. He was an eager student and by the age of eleven had attained a high level of achievement. It was deemed appropriate for him to be removed from the school and placed with his uncle, Rev Isaac Hodgson, who was a clever and intuitive tutor. In later years Evans regarded the time he spent with the Hodgsons as the most pleasant of his youth, and remembered Hodgson‚Äôs wife, aunt Elizabeth, with great affection. In 1799 young Evans visited Oxford with his father and it was here that the fourteen year old gained a scholarship at Wadham College. His youth initially singled him out for some attention from the older boys, but he eventually fitted in, and for a period enjoyed the social side of university life. He eventually knuckled down to study and was awarded B.A in 1803, M.A. in 1808 and became a fellow in 1806. He was ordained a deacon in June 1808 and became a priest in December 1810. This was the same year that he married his first wife, Caroline Joyce, from Freshford, Somerset. Death of mother His mother had been ill for several years with a lung condition and Evans was repeatedly called home from the college as her condition worsened. When she finally died in February 1804 he became traumatised, suffered chest pains, lost weight and was sent to the Isle of Wight to recuperate. He stayed at Cowes and formed a lifelong attachment to the area. Early years as curate His first sermon was given at Worldham, Hampshire, where his uncle was the curate. His shyness made this an uncomfortable experience, and remained an issue with him for the rest of his life. To combat this he prepared his sermons in advance, reading these from the pulpit, and admitted that in his early days he carried a ‚Äúvial of wine‚Äù in his pocket to help with his nerves. In 1809 Evans began work as a curate at Worplesdon, Surrey, followed by Enville, Staffordshire. After his engagement to Caroline Joyce he returned to the south of England so that the couple could be closer to their families. Evans‚Äô father offered to buy him an advowson, but instead he took up a curacy at the coastal parish of Milford and Hordle, Hampshire. In June 1811 the couple‚Äôs first child was born, but died within a year. In their despair Evans questioned his own faith and religious commitment. A parishioner, aware of his troubled mind, offered him a volume of sermons by the Rev John Hill. Reading these came as a revelation to Evans, and as a result his well-being improved and the character of his ministry changed from that of pastoral to evangelical. He began taking his message to the local community by giving evening lectures, visiting people at their home and in the fields, giving bible readings and taking prayers. His sermons attracted interest from locals and outsiders; however, all was not well. His followers in the community were mainly from the working class sector, but amongst the gentry and employers there was enmity toward his ministry. Some walked out of his church before his sermons, or left and padlocked their pews. Resentment was such that farm workers and servants who attended his services at the vicarage were sacked. Evans later realised that during this period his enthusiasm had induced errors of judgement, which he afterwards regretted. One of his friends said of him that: This was demonstrated during a church service in Milford when he pointed a finger at Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, and thundered ‚ÄúI see the devil walking in the midst of you‚Äù. In protest the Admiral transferred to another church four miles away, not to return until Evans was replaced. Cornwallis owned Newlands Manor, Milford, and lived there with his companion Mary Anne Theresa Whitby and her daughter, Theresa John Cornwallis Whitby; she was later known as, Mrs West, mother of William Cornwallis-West. Mrs West wrote that the area was in the grip of \\"religious mania in which none was so mad as the Vicar\\". Her mother once visited an \\"evening conventicle\\" held at Rev Evans' vicarage: The situation in the parish came to a head in 1815 when his rector gave Evans six month notice to quit. It was then that Evans took the decision to secede from the Church of England and leave Milford. The reasons for his discontent with the established church included the baptism of infants and the union of the Church with the State. His relatives and those of his wife were ‚Äúgreatly displeased and wounded‚Äù by his actions. His decision to secede endangered the financial security and the reputation of his family. Evans needed an exit strategy to tide him over, and this was provided by Rev George Baring. Western Schism Rev Baring (1781‚Äì1854) was the son of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, co-founder of the Barings Bank. He was privately educated and worked for his father for some years before deciding to take holy orders in the Church of England. He attended Magdalene College, Cambridge 1813, ordained deacon the same year and ordained priest in 1814. From 1813 he was curate to, Rev Thomas Tregenna Biddulph, in Durston and Lyng near Taunton, Somerset. In 1815 he became the minister for the parish of Winterbourne Stoke, under the patronage of his brother, Alexander Baring, who was the Member of Parliament for Taunton. Walford House Within a few months Rev Baring seceded from the Church of England, moving to Walford House, Taunton where he purchased the Octagon Chapel in Middle Street, ministering as Trinitarian, or Particular Baptists. Other clergy who had seceded from the established church joined him in Taunton, including Rev Thomas Snow (1786-1867), Rev George Bevan (1782‚Äì1819) and James Harrington Evans. Several members of Rev Baring's family supported and encouraged him in this venture, including his sister, Harriet (Baring) Wall (1768‚Äì1838), and brother, Sir Thomas Baring of Stratton Park. Others drawn into this circle included Baring‚Äôs brothers-in-law, Thomas Read Kemp, and Philip Laycock Story, 1782‚Äì1843. Both Snow and Bevan, like Baring, were the sons of bankers; Snow‚Äôs father was George Snow of Snow, Statton and Paul, and Bevan‚Äôs father was Silvanus Bevan (1743‚Äì1830) of Barclay, Bevan and Bening. Before they seceded, Snow and his curate Bevan had been ministers in the parishes of Micheldever, East Stratton, Popham and Northington, under the patronage of wealthy banker, Henry Drummond (1786‚Äì1860) of The Grange, and Sir Thomas Baring.Munden, Alan; Thomas Snow and the Western Schism; Churchman Vol 125/4 (2011) Snow, had been the minister at Winterbourne Stoke preceding Rev Baring's brief tenure, and he was on affable terms with James Harington Evans, who officiated at his wedding. Baptisms at the Octagon Chapel were dispensed to those who professed faith, and it was administered by immersion. Evans and George Baring were baptised in this manner by George Bevan at the Chapel in June 1816. Evans then spent several months preaching in the surrounding area before moving with his family to London at the end of 1816. Rev George Baring continued with his ministry until 1819 when he left Britain. It seems that after this he had little involvement with religious affairs. Rev Snow was eventually accepted back into the Church of England after a period of ‚Äúatonement‚Äù. Rev Bevan remained in conflict with the Established Church over the doctrine of the Trinity and died in 1819. In the same year James Harington Evans published his views on this subject in a pamphlet titled A Series of Dialogues on Important Subjects. This work was considered by some to be heretical and he came to regret and feel ashamed of this period in his life. His ministry suffered and the congregation became just a handful. His response was to publish an unreserved retraction and buy up all the copies of the work that remained at the booksellers. In 1826 he published a more detailed explanation in a pamphlet titled Letters to a Friend. His views on the Trinity had been formed after he read the works of Dr Isaac Watts and this humiliating experience made him less trusting of others. It was said that after this ‚Äúhe walked softly all his years in the bitterness of his soul.‚Äù Chapel at Milford By the time Evans left Milford in 1816 he had a significant number of followers. His revival meetings had been held in homes and at the vicarage, but a dedicated place of worship was required. Evans and friends funded the building of a chapel in Milford and this was opened for public worship in January 1816. Evans appointed lay preacher James Turquand (1787-1836) as the minister, a position he held for the next twenty-one years. Turquand was baptised in August 1816 and the following day he baptised fourteen people. His background had been in agriculture, and he worked for many years as a land steward at Norman Court, the Hampshire estate of Harriet (Baring) Wall and her husband Charles Wall.The Baptist Magazine, November 1837. Evans continued to take an interest in the ministry at the Milford Baptist church, raising funds, visiting the area and corresponding. The church still remains in Barnes Lane, Milford, where it was built over 200 years ago. John Street Chapel When Evans moved to London in 1816 he preached in various places of worship before becoming the pastor of the John Street Chapel, Bloomsbury. The building had been leased to him for life by banker Henry Drummond, who was described as 'a disorderly force of intellect and character'. Drummond was a philanthropist, wrote numerous books, supported missionary work, became a member of parliament at the age of twenty-five, and helped found the Catholic Apostolic Church. This was a movement commonly known as Irvingism, based on Edward Irving‚Äôs prophesy that the Second Advent was imminent. Irving was a charismatic preacher from Scotland, who moved to London in about 1821 and became the minister of the Caledonian Church, Hatton Garden, London. The church later relocated to Regent Square, about half a mile from the John Street Chapel, where he occasionally preached in the early days. Many of those involved with the Irvingism cult were know to Evans, and some were his oldest most faithful friends, but he now considered them to be heretics and their friendship lost to him, including his patron, Henry Drummond. Evans remained friends with Harriet (Baring) Wall and occasionally stayed with her in her Lymington home, just a few miles from Milford. From there he was able to visit another old friend and mentor, Rev Richard Adams in Cowes, IoW. Robert Cleaver Chapman Deacons helped Evans run the chapel and in 1823 one of these, lawyer John Whitmore, invited a 20 year old Robert Cleaver Chapman (1803‚Äì1902) to hear Evans preach. This was a life changing experience for him and he asked to be baptised. In response, Evans told him to wait until he fully understood the implications and responsibilities of this action, but Chapman persisted and eventually Evans agreed. With mentoring from Evans, he became involved with the ministry of the John Street Chapel, giving sermons and helping with the poor in the surrounding area. In 1831 he was asked by his cousin, Thomas Pugsley ((1794-1834), to preach at a workhouse in Devon. This led to an invitation to become the pastor in a Particular Baptist chapel in Barnstable. He was unable to reconcile differences within the congregation and in about 1834 a split occurred. Chapman became the pastor of the Open Brethren in Barnstable, locating eventually to a chapel in Bear Street. In 1848, he with others tried to intercede in a dispute between two leading figures in the Brethren movement, John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Wills Newton. In this he failed, and a division occurred resulting in the formation of the Open Brethren and the Exclusive Brethren. Some of the Darby supporters were critical of Chapman, but Darby told them ‚ÄúYou leave that man alone, he lives what I teach‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWe talk of heavenlies, but Robert Chapman lives in them‚Äù. Chapman occasionally visited London, staying with Evans and preaching at the John Street Chapel. In 1842 Evans wrote of him: However, Evans was not so complementary about the Brethren, that he considered separated the family of God. Rev Charles Shepherd In about 1843 Evans started to suffer from head pains. A dozen leeches were administered by his physician but his condition failed to improve. His doctor then suggested that he rest and have a change of diet. This eased the problem for a period, but he was unable to continue full time work. Requiring assistance he appointed Baptist minister, Rev Charles Arundel Morice Shepherd (1806-1855), who he knew from his visits to the Barnstable area of Devon. He was pastor of the Baptist chapels in the local parishes of Eastacombe, Hiscott and Lovacott, built by Chapman‚Äôs cousin, Thomas Pugsley. Evans‚Äô health never fully recovered, although at times he was able to minister on a limited basis. In 1847 he had a bout of bronchitis brought on after he attended the funeral of his step-mother on a bitterly cold day. In 1849 Rev Shepard was indisposed and Evans pondered asking Rev Baptist Wriothesley Noel to minister temporarily. Noel had recently seceded from the Established Church and Evans was of a mind to offer him the chapel on the surrender of his own life interest. In August of 1849 Noel was baptised into the John Street Chapel by Rev Shepherd with Evans in attendance. Rev Baptist Wriothesley Noel The Hon. and Rev. Baptist Wriothesley Noel, M.A., (1799‚Äì1873) was the son of Baroness Barham and Sir Gerard Noel-Noel, Bart; one of his brothers was Earl of Gainsborough. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming one of the chaplains to the Queen in August 1841. For twenty-one years he was the minister of St John‚Äôs Chapel, Bedford-row, London, resigning in 1848 when he seceded from the Established Church. As a Dissenting minister he could have been prohibited from preaching within his former London diocese, but Bishop Blomfield took no such action. Noel swore an oath as prescribed by 52 Geo Vol III, before preaching his first sermon at Mr Binney‚Äôs, Congregational Weigh House Chapel, where he received the Lord‚Äôs Supper. Noel was looking for another chapel, having relinquished the lease on the St John‚Äôs Chapel. It was rumoured that he was interested in Mr Mortimer‚Äôs Chapel, Grays-inn Road but this came to nothing. Evans was in correspondence with Henry Drummond‚Äôs solicitor about him parting with the lease on his John Street Chapel, and it was his wish that Noel should take this on with congregational approval. In a letter, dated 7 August 1849, Evans indicated his belief that the deal for Noel to purchase the Chapel had gone through. However, in a letter of the 5 September 1849 he acknowledged that this information had been incorrect. Final days On this same day Evans was driving a hired phaeton with his wife and a friend in Scotland, where he had been staying since July of that year. Going downhill the horse bolted, and at a bridge one of the wheels struck the side, throwing Evans off. His wife and friend remained in the carriage and were safe, the horse being stopped some distance away. Evans claimed in a letter that although he lost consciousness, his only other injuries were severe bruising. But shortly an abscess formed on the arm that had been worst affected in the fall and a fever developed. He gradual weakened until on the 1 December 1849 he passed away in Stonehaven, Scotland. His remains were returned to London and he was buried in Hampstead cemetery on the 6 December. Rev Charles Shepherd and Rev Baptist Noel spoke at the funeral; Rev Octavius Winslow preached a funeral sermon at the John Street Chapel on the following Sunday. Winslow‚Äôs mother, Mrs. Mary Winslow, had been a congregant of the John Street Chapel since 1828. About this same time it was confirmed that Baptist Noel was the new minister at the John Street Chapel, a position he held until he retired in 1869. Family Evans first wife was Caroline Joyce (1787‚Äì1831) and they had three children who survived to adulthood: Rev James Joyce Evans (1813‚Äì1881); Caroline Evans (1815‚Äì1882) and Frederic Hodgson Evans (1821‚Äì1877). Evans married his second wife, Elizabeth Bird (1799‚Äì1878), in 1833. She was the daughter of Lucy Wilberforce Bird (1768‚Äì1847) and Robert Bird (1761‚Äì1842). Her brothers included Robert Merttins Bird and Edward Bird, father of Isabella Bird. There were no children from this marriage. Writings Evans was the author of several books and hymns; many are listed in the British Library Catalogue and several are available in the public domain.Scanned copies of books attributed to James Harington Evans References Category:1785 births Category:1849 deaths Category:English Baptist ministers Category:19th-century Baptist ministers ","title":"James Harington Evans"},{"id":"64220273","title":"Felix Film"},{"id":"64220287","text":"Dhruv Rathee is an Indian YouTuber and social media activist known for his political commentary.

The initiative to setup the TAI is attributed to having been driven by Nattapol Rangsitpol, one of the Thai government's officials most familiar with the Thai automotive industry and the Director General of the Office of Industrial Economics (as of June, 2020). In 1998, Nattapol recalls, \\"The Department of Industrial Works was my first workplace in the position of engineer but in that period, the government planned to establish the TAI, separately as a new agency from the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI), and I was assigned to draft the TAI's regulations and master plan for transport and environment in order to carry on the automotive policy in the country.\\" The mission of the TAI was to assist in the development and promotion of the Thai automotive industry so that it could better compete in the global market. The stated vision of the TAI is (to be) \\"The leading organization of automotive and auto parts industry development with environmental-friendly business ecosystem and modernization\\". Their stated mission has five parts: * To be knowledge center and expertise for automotive industry development * To support operation of organizations in testing standard, inspection and innovation development * To develop human resources in automotive, auto parts and related industry * To expand research & development and enhance competence of entrepreneur for more productivity * To collaborate among organizations in Thailand and international for automotive industry development Some of the areas the TAI has activities in are: * Engineering Development * Thai Automotive Industry Data Reporting * Training and Consulting * Entrepreneur Development * Organizing and conducting professional industry symposiums * Thai Government Policy Proposals and Coordination In 2005 TAI was involved in the Capacity Building for a Recycling-Based Economy in APEC project. In this project they co-organized a symposium for APEC Capacity Building on a Recycling-based Economy: Guidelines for Thailand where TAI's director, Mr. Vallop Tiasiri, gave a presentation on Overview of a Recycling-based Economy: System and Technologies in Automotive Sector in Thailand. In December of 2012, TAI issued their \\"Master Plan for Automotive Industry 2012 ‚Äì 2016\\" report. This report looked back at the past six decades of the Thai automotive industry as well as made projections to the year 2050 to include looking at the Thailand automotive industry within the context of total ASEAN motor vehicle production. It was reported on November 8th, 2016 that TAI, along with the 10 other independent organizations under the Ministry of Industry, were to be tasked to develop key Thai industries. This was part of the Ministry of Industry's proposed plan for a new venture capital fund to support startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in gaining access to funding. In 2018, TAI signed a letter of intent with Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro) for talks on next-generation vehicles to develop the EV industry in Thailand. In early September of 2019, TAI proposed a committee be established to drive the Thai government's electric vehicle (EV) scheme and increase sales as the market develops. The TAI stated it has a long-term roadmap for Thailand to become a production hub for EVs in Southeast Asia, with a goal to produce 2.5 million cars in 2030. Of the goal, 1.5 million cars are set for domestic sale.  Automotive testing, research and development center  TAI operates a testing research and development center which provides services and performs activities as follows: * Testing services for national standardization and customer needs in the five categories: ** Emission testing ** Mechanical and tire testing ** Environmental and corrosion testing ** Chemical testing ** Dimension measurement * Engineering services - consulting services for testing and testing design * International certification and homologation service * Standard/Regulations support Foundation for Industrial Development TAI, along with seven sister institutes, falls under the oversight of the Foundation for Industrial Development (FID), which is sometimes referred to in translation as The Industrial Development Foundation.

She was a pacifist who became convinced that Portugal should fight in the First World War. Life Portuguese Women and the European War - 1916 Pinheiro was born in Viseu in central Portugal in 1872. She and the poet Carlos de Lemos published an arts magazine in Viseu named Ave Azul (\\"Bluebird\\") which ran for twelve issues in 1899 and 1900. In the magazine they published revolutionary ideas about the rights of women. They thought that a woman should be able to create a dignified life for herself without the need of a man. She called on readers to champion the rights of women to compete in education on an equal footing with men and to gain their right to equal civil and political equality. She lauded Alice Pestana's Portuguese League for Peace founded in 1899. Pinheiro believed that educated women could contribute to creating world peace. These were revolutionary ideas. Pestana was also publishing her ideas but under a nom de plume of Cil in the newspaper Vanguardia. She became the representative of the Portuguese League for Peace and she used her writing to further its republican ideals in Viseu. She wrote for A Beira, Almanaque de Senhoras, Alma feminina or A Cr√≥nica. In time she and Carlos found it better to move to Lisbon. When the Republic was formed, on October 5, 1910, Beatriz Pinheiro was in Lisbon, participating in the campaign to approve the Divorce Law. In June 1913, she, Ana Augusta de Castilho, Ana de Castro Os√≥rio, Luthgarda de Caires, Joana de Almeida Nogueira and Maria Veleda were part of the Portuguese delegation at the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Budapest. During the First World War on 8 June 1916 she held a conference at Liceu Maria Pia where she was teaching. As a result she published A Mulher Portugu√™sa e a Guerra Europeia (Portuguese Women and the European War). This was a defining moment as Pinheiro who was a known pacifist and radical, defended Portugal's participation in World War I. Pinheiro died in Lisbon in 1922.

History The Plastics Institute of Thailand was founded by resolution of Thailand's Ministry of Industry on November 16, 2010. It was given the mission of supporting the long-term development of the Thai plastics industry through a three prong strategy: Strategy 1: Technology and management development Strategy 2: Increasing marketing capabilities Strategy 3: Creating a plastic industry database On July 25, 2015, it was reported that PITH was ordered by the Ministry of Industry to work out details for the initial plan to use 10,000 tonnes of rice from government stockpiles to produce environmentally friendly bioplastic products to coincide with an initiative of the Prime Minister of Thailand General Prayut Chan-o-cha. This was to be completed by July 29, 2020. It was reported on November 8, 2016 that PITH, along with the 10 other independent organizations under the Ministry of Industry, were to be tasked to develop key Thai industries. This was part of the Ministry of Industry's proposed plan for a new venture capital fund to support startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in gaining access to funding. PITH is involved in the public and private effort to control plastic waste. PITH Executive Director Dr. Kriengsak Wongpromrat reported in a July 1, 2019 article on Thailand's plastic waste problem that the production capacity of plastic beads in Thailand will be flat, staying at 8 million tonnes from 2018 to 2019, because the government's policy is promoting lower use of some plastic products and outright banning others. \\"In the past, the plastics sector expanded 1-2% annually, but this trend is expected to become a contraction in the future,\\" Kriengsak said. He went on to say other countries are also facing pressure to reduce plastic use as environmental concerns gain traction. \\"Plastic waste cannot be destroyed easily, so all authorities have to issue new policies to resolve the overwhelming waste problem,\\" he said. Kriengsak promoted the production of bioplastics in Thailand in an August 18, 2019 article. He stated that the strategy that he is trying to support is to covert bioresin made from sugar into finished and semi-finished plastic products. \\"We want to try to maximize the value chain of biopolymers but currently have to accept that Total Corbion is mainly exporting to EU and other countries,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe institute is working with small and medium-scale processors to support them in developing bioplastics conversion expertise. We‚Äôve worked with 82 converters to date in developing products such as bags and thermoformed trays and bowls, but we need more to participate.‚Äù Activities Some of the activities conducted by PITH are: *Support technology and management development of the Thai plastics industry *Support marketing of the Thai plastics industry *Create and maintain a database of the Thai plastics industry * Statistical gathering and reporting on the Thai plastics industry * Supporting Thai government plastic waste management efforts * Promoting the Thai plastics industry Foundation for Industrial Development PITH, along with seven sister institutes, falls under the oversight of the Foundation for Industrial Development (FID), which is sometimes referred to in translation as The Industrial Development Foundation. The Board of Directors of the FID provides oversight to the Board of Directors of the institute. The other institutes under the FID are: * Thai-German Institute (TGI) * Thailand Textile Institute (THTI) * National Food Institute (NFI) *Management System Certification Institute (MASCI) * Electrical and Electronics Institute (EEI) * Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) * Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand (ISIT) Ministry of Industry Network Industry Network Logo On 1 March 2019, the driving committee of the institutions under the Ministry of Industry aimed to create public awareness of its network of institutions. An Industry Network logo was created to be used in publicizing the mission of the institution networks as a symbol of their cooperation in driving Thailand's mission in the digital age.

Life and Works Dione Venables was born Dione Gordon-Finlay in Great Missenden, England 1930, second daughter of Alan and Florence (n√©e Gallagher). Her early childhood was dominated by a life at St. Leonard's boarding-school from the age of three, and then twice narrowly escaping with her life during The Blitz in London. She developed a relationship with Arthur Ransome during the 2nd World War, who encouraged her to write. Her first attempt featured a hedgehog called Edward Wigg, who was adapted by her cousin Jacintha Buddicom in support of the War Effort as part of the National Savings Movement. Venables wrote her own diaries, but it wasn‚Äôt until 1962 that she published her first articles for magazines and local newspapers reporting on her experiences in Africa, the Middle East and Pakistan, whilst providing relief flights for refugees in war torn states. In 1969, Venables began writing and presenting scripts for radioBFBS publicity photograph, circa 1972 and in 1978, she published her first novel, with its sequel a year later. In the 1980s, she published five more novels before switching her attention to publishing. Dione Venables at home, 2019 (photograph by Sally Devincenzi)In 2006, Venables created Finlay Publisher with the aim of promoting the life and works of the writer George Orwell. Finlay Publisher‚Äôs first act was to print a new edition of Eric & Us, adding a detailed post-script written by Venables based on a series of previously unpublished diaries, letters and documented interviews. In August of the same year, Venables created a website called Orwell Direct, a forum for academics and enthusiasts alike to exchange views about Orwell, which in 2008, began publishing a series of twenty articles written by eminent Literati, who between them had written at length about George Orwell. They included Sir Bernard Crick, Gordon Bowker, DJ Taylor, Professor Peter Davison and Orwell‚Äôs son, Richard Blair. Contributors encouraged Venables to institute a more formal collective of Orwell enthusiasts and on December 27th, 2010, The Orwell Society was inaugurated by Venables at Phyllis Court. In 2015, she compiled and published Orwell‚Äôs poetry, and in 2017, she published an account of her own war time experiences.

She was also a prominent feminist and an opponent of the Estado Novo authoritarian regime, for which she was imprisoned for three months. Background Cesina Bermudes was born on May 20, 1908, in Lisbon, Portugal in the parish of Anjos. She was the daughter of F√©lix Bermudes and C√¢ndida Em√≠lia Borges. Her father was an author and playwright as well as being a notable sportsman who represented Portugal in shooting at the Summer Olympics and was a financial supporter and president of S.L. Benfica, now one of Portugal‚Äôs leading soccer clubs. Her mother was a well-educated woman who taught her French and read Greek mythology to her at bedtime. Bermudes inherited her father‚Äôs athleticism and was a swimming champion, also taking part in skating, gymnastics and in bicycle and car races, being one of the first women in Portugal to obtain a driving licence. Like her father she was a member of the Theosophical Society of Portugal, where she served as secretary-general. She believed in reincarnation and was a vegetarian. After initially receiving a private education at home Cesina Mercedes attended the elite Cam√µes Secondary School. When she joined there were four other girls in her class, but by the time she left she was the only girl in a glass with 15 boys. She graduated from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon in 1933 and followed this with a General Internship and an Internship in Surgery with a speciality in Obstetrics. She worked as a doctor at the ‚ÄúCentre for Assistance to Maternity and Childhood‚Äù in Lisbon. This was followed by a period as Assistant Professor of Anatomy at a Lisbon hospital. In 1947 she became the first woman to obtain a Doctorate in medicine (with a score of 19 out of 20). The title of her thesis was Os M√∫sculos Radiais Externos Estudados nos Portugueses de Condi√ß√£o Humilde (The External Radial Musculature Observed in the Portuguese Low Income Population). However, as a result of her political activism the Estado Novo did not allow her to pursue an academic teaching career. As a result, she taught at a nurses‚Äô college. Her political awareness had been formed in the early 1940s and she became a supporter of the opposition to the Estado Novo. In 1945 she joined the Movement of Democratic Unity, a semi-legal umbrella organization of groups that opposed the Government. She supported the candidacy of Jos√© Norton de Matos in the 1949 Portuguese presidential elections and spoke in his support at several rallies. On October 14, 1949 she was arrested by the Portuguese Secret Police (PIDE) for being a member of the Central Commission of the Women's Democratic National Movement, and held in prison at Caxias, near Lisbon, for three months. In 1950, she was involved in developing the constitution of the National Committee for the Defence of Peace. Promotion of childbirth without pain In 1954 Cesina Bermudes travelled to Paris to study the psychoprophylactic method of childbirth, often known as the Lamaze technique after its founder the French obstetrician Fernand Lamaze. The technique aims to build a mother's confidence in her ability to give birth, through classes that help pregnant women understand how to cope with pain in ways that facilitate labour. In Paris she met three other Portuguese doctors, Joaquim Seabra-Dinis, Pedro Monjardino and Jo√£o dos Santos, who she subsequently worked with to develop new techniques that would have a great impact in the way labour could be approached, including the use of medicines to stimulate birth. Back in Lisbon she introduced these techniques to Portugal. Some of her ideas were considered almost heretical at the time. Painless childbirth was still an inconceivable idea, especially for Catholics who believed that a woman should suffer when fulfilling the role of mother. Only in 1956 did Pope Pius XII lift the Catholic condemnation of childbirth without pain. Bermudes rapidly became a highly respected figure in the medical field. She produced several articles in medical journals of which Scientific Bases of Childbirth without Pain (Bases Cient√≠ficas do Parto sem Dor) in 1955 and Notes on Childbirth without Pain (Notas Soltas sobre o Parto sem Dor) in 1957 are the best known. Following the 1958 elections, when the Estado Novo was again returned to office, she disappeared from political matters to enable her to provide medical assistance to pregnant women of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), who were forced to live clandestinely. Forbidden by the state from working in public hospitals, she worked in clinics in Lisbon and Cascais that were devoted to supporting single mothers. Cesina Bermudes died on December 9, 2001. Awards * In 1989 she was awarded the Portuguese Order of Freedom (), which rewards relevant services to the cause of democracy and freedom.

It was constructed beginning in 1936 by Edwin Howard Armstrong in order to promote his invention of wide-band FM broadcasting. W2XMN was the first FM station to began regular operations, and was used to introduce FM broadcasting to the general public in the New York City area. The station, in addition to being a testing site for transmitter and receiver development, was used for propagation studies and as an over-the-air relay station for distributing network programming to other FM stations in the region. W2XMN primarily operated on what became known as FM's \\"low band\\", mostly transmitting on 42.8 MHz until December 1946, and on 44.1 MHz thereafter. The station ceased operating in 1949, after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reassigned the \\"low band\\" frequencies to other services. At this point most of W2XMN's functions were inherited by Armstrong's \\"high band\\" FM station, KE2XCC, located at the same Alpine site, which had been established in 1945 as W2XEA, and remained in operation until 1954. History Armstrong was already a well known radio inventor when he developed \\"wide-band\\" FM technology in the early 1930s, which he considered to be such a superior approach to radio transmissions that it would soon make existing AM broadcasting stations obsolete. He initially sought the support of the largest U.S. radio company at the time, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), and quietly made some developmental transmissions from that company's testing site at the Empire State Building in New York City. RCA eventually decided that it was not interested in FM, instead concentrating on television development, and asked Armstrong to remove his equipment. Without RCA's support Armstrong faced a more difficult task in promoting FM, and began to recruit smaller electronics firms as allies. In addition, Armstrong was independently wealthy due to revenue from sales of his earlier patents, and could afford to spend large sums promoting FM himself. Because of the high transmitting frequencies in use, which tended to limit station ranges to \\"line-of-sight\\" distances, it was important to have signals broadcast from as high a point as possible. Armstrong arranged for the construction of a distinctive tower with three large cross-arms, located atop the Alpine, New Jersey Palisades overlooking the Hudson River a few kilometers north of New York City. On June 12, 1936 he was issued permission to operate an experimental station, with the call sign W2XMN, from the Alpine site. In 1938 this station was assigned to transmit on 42.8 MHz, which would be its primary frequency for the next ten years. (An additional temporary frequency assignment for 117.43 MHz was issued in 1941.)History Cards for W2XMN (1936-1950) (Federal Communications Commission) A 1939 article in Fortune magazine dramatically described the station as \\"When W2XMN, on 42.8 megacycles (approximately seven meters), opened fire in 1938, it was the last gun to crush even the most obdurate opposition.\\"\\"Revolution in Radio\\", Fortune, October 1939, page 121 (included as \\"Exhibit P-44\\", page 14a, in the lawsuit \\"Esther Marion Armstrong vs. Motorola, Inc\\", Seventh District Court of Appeals, No. 14830.) In 1948 testimony, Armstrong recapped the events as: Armstrong did his initial development with limited publicity, which led to a local newspaper referring to his highly visible tower as \\"Bergen County's mysterious 400-foot tower\\".\\"New Type Radio Perfected At Alpine Testing Station\\", (Hackensack, New Jersey) Bergen Evening Record, January 17, 1939, pages 1-2. In January 1939 he made a widely publicized announcement about his work and future plans, including the introduction of regular FM broadcasts in conjunction with John V. L. Hogan's New York City station, WQXR (now WFME), which had been promoting high-fidelity transmissions on the AM band.\\"At Long Last---Static-free Radio!\\", Radio Craft, April 1939, pages 588, 618-619. The first public W2XMN broadcast took place on July 18, 1939, which used a high- quality phone line link to rebroadcast a program from WQXR.Rebel in Radio by Elliot A. Sanger, 1973, page 50. W2XMN continued to be used as a test site for developing FM technology as well as for a broadcasting service which gave the public a chance to evaluate the potential of FM transmissions, and in early 1940 the station's broadcasting schedule was reported to be 4:00 to 11:00 p.m. weekdays.\\"W2XMN: Major Armstrong's Own F-M Station\\" section of \\"Frequency Modulation Stations Multiply\\" by Perry Ferrell, Jr., Radio And Television, March 1940, page 666. In May 1940, largely as the result of Armstrong's efforts, the FCC authorized a commercial FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42‚Äì50 MHz.\\"FCC Order No. 67\\", Federal Register, May 25, 1940, page 2011. W2XMN had been relying programs from CBS, but because that company was now making plans to establish its own New York City FM station, it was announced that W2XMN programming would be switching to 10 hours daily of playing \\"electrical transcriptions\\", which were high-quality phonograph records.\\"New FM Programs\\", Broadcasting, January 13, 1941, page 70. With the entrance of the United States into WWII in late 1941, civilian development of FM largely ceased, as Armstrong worked on developing FM communications for military applications. After the end of the war, on June 27, 1945 the FCC announced that due to interference concerns it was reallocating the current FM \\"low band\\" frequencies to other services, with 42‚Äì44 MHz going to \\"non-government fixed and mobile\\", and 44‚Äì50 MHz allocated to television channel 1. (The TV allocation was later reassigned as additional \\"non-government fixed and mobile\\" frequencies.) This in turn meant that existing FM band stations would be relocated to 88-106 MHz (later expanded to 108 MHz). Armstrong had strenuously objected to this move when it was still just a proposal, as being unnecessarily disruptive. However, at the time of its adoption he also announced that he had developed the technology needed for stations to simultaneously broadcast on both their original \\"low band\\" and new \\"high band\\" frequencies to help ease the transition.\\"FCC Allocates 88-106 mc Band to FM\\" by Bill Bailey, Broadcasting, July 2, 1945, pages 13-14.\\"FCC Allocations Order Text\\", Broadcasting, July 2, 1945, pages 64-68. He also applied for a \\"high band\\" station authorization, which was granted on August 6, 1945 as W2XEA, operating on 92.1 MHz. In July 1946 the FCC directed that FM stations currently operating on 42-44 MHz would have to move to new frequencies by the end of the year.\\"Filling in the Spectrum\\", Television Digest and FM Reports, July 20, 1946, page 1. Thus, in late December W2XMN's primary assignment was changed from 42.8 to 44.1 MHz, still operating with 40 kw. (An additional temporary frequency assignment for 92.5 MHz was issued in 1947, for \\"investigating problems of 400 kc separation of FM stations\\".) In the late 1940s the fledgling FM radio industry worked to establish high quality programming while containing costs. In 1947 the Continental network was established, centered on station WASH in Washington, D.C., which distributed programming to stations in the northeast United States. Some stations were linked to the network by special telephone lines, which were expensive and only available in limited areas. An alternate, and much less expensive, means of distribution used by Continental involved linking stations directly, by picking up other network station's transmissions. As of June 19, 1947, over-the-air transmissions from W2XMN and W2XEA provided the link to the Continental network for four additional stations.\\"Station Arrangement in the Continental Network as of broadcasts for June 19, 1947\\", FM and Television, July 1947, page 33. Armstrong continued to vigorously fight the pending move to the \\"high band\\" on the grounds that it was not technically needed, and also because the higher frequencies had less coverage. This was borne out by a series of observations comparing simulcasts of \\"low band\\" W2XMN with \\"high band\\" W2XEA. In early 1948 a Stromberg-Carlson executive testified that, listening from a location in upstate New York, \\"It has been my personal experience that the 44- to 50-megacycle band gives more reliable reception for rural and regional FM than the 88- to 108-megacycle band\\" and \\"reception from W2XMN, Alpine, N.

It was licensed from 1941 until around 1953 to inventor Edwin Howard Armstrong, and was co-located with two other Armstrong stations, W2XMN (until its suspension in 1949), and W2XEA/KE2XCC (1945-1954). However, for most of its existence WFMN was authorized for significantly lower power than the other two stations, and appears to have rarely been on the air. History In May 1940, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized a commercial FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42‚Äì50 MHz.\\"FCC Order No. 67\\", Federal Register, May 25, 1940, page 2011. (This was later changed to 88‚Äì106 MHz, and still later to 88‚Äì108 MHz, which increased the number of channels to 100.) At this time Edwin Howard Armstrong, the inventor of \\"wide-band\\" FM, was already operating experimental station W2XMN on 42.8 MHz, transmitting from a tower he had constructed a few kilometers north of New York City in Alpine, New Jersey. Under the new provisions he was granted an additional authorization for a commercial station broadcasting on 43.1 MHz from the Alpine site, which was issued the call sign W31NY.\\"Three FM Grants In New York Area\\", Broadcasting, June 23, 1941, page 18. The initial policy for commercial FM station call signs included an initial \\"W\\" for stations located east of the Mississippi River, followed by the last two digits of a station's frequency assignment, \\"31\\" in this case, and closing with a one or two character city identifier, which for New York metropolitan stations was \\"NY\\". Under the initial regulations, commercial FM frequencies were divided into three categories, with \\"Class C\\" stations having the greatest coverage.\\"FM Rules to Speed Up Applications\\", Broadcasting, October 15, 1940, page 30. W31NY was assigned to one of three Class C frequencies available to the New York City area,\\"FCC Sets Hearing On New York FM\\",Broadcasting, September 15, 1941, page 50. which had an estimated coverage area of 15,610 square miles (40,430 km2), corresponding to a radius of approximately 70 miles (110 km).\\"FCC Authorization For 53 Commercial FM Outlets Given\\", Broadcasting, August 18, 1941, page 54. There are very few reports of W31NY actually making any broadcasts, in contrast to W2XMN, which was assigned to a similar frequency but with higher power. However one example occurred in March 1942, when it was reported that W31NY had been used to rebroadcast a program relayed from station W43B near Boston.\\"Damm Is Elected At Meeting of FM Stations\\", Broadcasting, March 9, 1942, page 47. Effective November 1, 1943, the FCC modified its policy for FM station call letters,\\"Standard Broadcast Station Call Letters for All Outlets Starting Nov. 1, FCC Rule\\", The Billboard, September 4, 1943, page 7. and W31NY's call sign was changed to WFMN.\\"New Calls Named For FM Stations\\", Broadcasting, October 4, 1943, page 49.

(The TV allocation was later reassigned as additional \\"non-government fixed and mobile\\" frequencies.) This in turn meant that existing FM band stations would be relocated to 88-106 MHz (later expanded to 108 MHz).\\"FCC Allocates 88-106 mc Band to FM\\" by Bill Bailey, Broadcasting, July 2, 1945, pages 13-14.\\"FCC Allocations Order Text\\", Broadcasting, July 2, 1945, pages 64, 68. Armstrong had strenuously objected to this move when it was still a proposal under review for being unnecessarily disruptive.

E. H. Armstrong\\", Broadcasting, July 2, 1945, page 70. Armstrong immediately filed an application for WFMN to move to 92.1 MHz in the new FM band.\\"Industry Supporting Decision on FM Move\\" by Bill Bailey, Broadcasting, July 9, 1945, page 18. However, the station was instead assigned to 100.9 MHz, and designated as a \\"metropolitan\\" station, which was a classification that was limited to an Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of 20 kw and a Height Above Average Terrain (HAAT) of 500 feet (150 meters). Operating from the Alpine tower, WFMN's HAAT was calculated to be 795 feet (240 meters), so to maintain the same coverage it was restricted to an ERP power of 6 kw.\\"News of the Industry: Assignments and Standards for F-M\\", Electronics, November 1945, page 472. Armstrong quickly complained that WFMN's power was inadequate for sufficient coverage, especially compared to the 100 to 125 kilowatts in use by W2XMN.\\"FM Assignment Protests to be Heard\\", Broadcasting, October 8, 1945, page 77.

This resulted in WFMN being reassigned to 98.9 MHz.\\"Docket No. 6781: Table I\\" (October 26, 1945), Federal Communications Commission Reports (volume 11), page 1513. A subsequent reallocation in the fall of 1947 assigned WFMN to 93.1 MHz.\\"New Frequency Assignments for FM Stations in the United States\\", Broadcasting, June 23, 1947, page 38. There is little evidence that WFMN actually made any broadcasts after transferring to the new band, in part because it continued to be limited to a power of 6 kw.\\"Directory of FM Broadcasting Stations of the United States: New Jersey\\" (January 1, 1948), Broadcasting Yearbook (1948 edition), page 304. On August 6, 1945 Armstrong was issued an authorization for a third station at Alpine, W2XEA (KE2XCC after 1949), operating under an experimental grant on 92.1 MHz with 50,000 watts. In late 1948 W2XEA moved from 92.1 MHz to share WFMN's assignment on 93.1 MHz.FCC History Cards for W2XEA (1945-1949) / KE2XCC (covering 1949-1952) (Federal Communications Commission) Although some contemporary sources included notifications that there was a relationship by W2XMN and W2XEA with WFMN,\\"Commercial FM Broadcasting Stations in U. S.\\", Broadcasting, July 22, 1946, page 66. any broadcasts appear to have been conducted by the more powerful experimental stations. An example of this occurred in February 1951, when it was reported that WFMN was being used as a test relay station for daily facsimile transmissions,\\"Facsimile Relay\\", Broadcasting, February 5, 1951, page 41. however Armstrong quickly corrected this, reporting that it was actually KE2XCC that was conducting the tests.\\"Facsimile Facts\\" (letter from Edwin H.

His most well-known and documented work was the 1950 anti-war pamphlet titled \\"I saw Truth in Korea\\" which contained photographic evidence of mass killings of civilians by the South Korean police during the Korean War. The publishing of this leaflet led to the British government debating whether to have him executed for treason, though it was decided instead to make him stateless by refusing to renew his passport. After the Korean War he travelled to Norsu territory to record the lives of slaves and document the abolition of slavery by the Chinese Communist Party, becoming the first European to live within a Norsu community and return alive. His findings were published in the anthropological study \\"Slaves of the Cool Mountains\\". After 1960 he spent the remainder of his life as an author of crime-fiction and children's books in East Germany. His autobiography Breakfast With Mao was published posthumously in 1986 after his death in 1983.  Early career  Winnington became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) British Communist Party around the year 1934. He became a branch secretary in Walthamstow after finding the party through discussions with leading British communist Harry Pollitt. After earning a press pass with the National Union of Journalists, Winnington became the press officer of the CPGB and was appointed chief editor of the Daily Worker (later renamed 'The Morning Star') for six years. In 1948 Winnington travelled to China to advise the Chinese Communist Party's information services while he accompanied the People's Liberation Army in the final stages of the Chinese Civil War. Around this time he began worked with Xinhua news department in Beijing.  Korean War ‚Äì \\"I Saw Truth in Korea\\"  In 1950 Winnington became one of only two Western English-speaking correspondents to accompany communist forces in the Korean War, the other being Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett. Within his study of war correspondents, professor of Journalism Phillip Knightley wrote that \\"Burchett and Winnington were a better source of news than the UN information officers, and if the allied reporters did not see them they risked being beaten on stories\\". Despite a ban on communications with communist journalists such as Burchett and Winnington, many British and American journalists ignored the ban, as their reports from the communist side were considered too valuable and important to miss and more trustworthy than official UN sources. In August 1950 Winnington published a pamphlet titled I Saw Truth in Korea with photographic evidence of mass graveyards containing the corpses 7,000 civilians executed by South Korean police near Taejon. Embarrassed by Winnington's leaflet, the Cabinet of the British government debated whether they could charge him with \\"treason\\", which if found guilty could lead to a death sentence. He was also accused of being involved in the interrogation of British prisoners of war in Korea. Though Winnington met with many British POWs held by the communist forces in Korea as he interviewed them and helped to improve their conditions, none of them have confirmed that Winnington ever took part in interrogations. An investigation in 1999 leading to declassified US military archives later confirmed Winnington's claims that there was indeed a mass execution of civilians by South Korean forces near Taejon as was documented within I Saw Truth in Korea.  Study of slave owners and headhunters  In 1954 Winnington's passport expired and was not renewed by the British government authorities making him virtually stateless (though it was eventually renewed in 1968). Unable to return to Britain he decided to continue living in China. After hearing news of slave owning societies in south China which had been virtually untouched by the Chinese Civil War and Communist Revolution, he set out to investigate. During his journey to investigate slave owning societies he also travelled to the China-Burma border to interview head-hunters of the Wa people and the relatively peaceful Jingpaw (Jingpo). His findings were published in an anthropological study titled \\"Slaves of the Cool Mountains: Travels Among The Head-hunters and Slave Owners in South-west China\\".  Slavery  In Liangshan (literally meaning ‚Äòcool mountains‚Äô) in China's southwest between Sichuan and Yunnan, there existed a complex system of slavery and nobility among the Yi people (often called Lolo, Nuosu, though Winnington called them Norsu). The Yi people were split into three social classes; the nuohuo or Black Yi (nobles), qunuo or White Yi (commoners), and slaves. The White Yi were free and could own slaves and property but were bound to a lord. Other ethnic groups in Liangshan including Hans were held as slaves by the Yi. During the 1950s the Communist Party of China attempted to abolish the practice of slavery in rural China, a process which Winnington recorded in his writings. However, slavery as a way of life was so deeply entrenched within Yi society that it took years to convince the people, including many of the slaves themselves, that the system of slavery can be abolished. During his time in Liangshi, Winnington spent months interviewing Yi people from all social classes including slaves, slave owners, commoners and nobility.  Head-hunters  After months with in Liangshan, Winnington travelled to the border between China and Burma to meet the Wa people, many of whom practiced head-hunting and would keep decapitated heads in baskets in an attempt to promote crop growth. Winnington wrote that by the time he was able to interview and record the Wa, including numerous head- hunters, that the practice of head-hunting was already in the process of being abolished. Winnington found that many of the Wa he interviewed viewed head- hunting as an embarrassing and shameful practice that they would be happy to see end.  Life in Germany  Winnington arrived in East Germany from China in 1960 to start a new life in East Berlin as the Daily Worker's East Berlin correspondent. His family and children instead travelled to Britain without WInnington. He started a new family in Germany and married a woman called Ursula Wittbrodt, who later became Ursula Winnington in 1967. While in Germany he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Daily Worker and occasionally as an advisor on Asian politics for the East German government. He began writing fiction alongside his work as a journalist, mostly novels of the crime-fiction genre. In 1980 Winnington wrote his autobiography Breakfast with Mao which was published posthumously in 1986 after his death in 1983.  Works  * I Saw Truth in Korea.

History WNNJ was originally authorized as a Class B FM station on 103.5 MHz to Donald Flamm and James V. Cosman, who also owned AM station WPAT.

It lies in the town's central Conservation Area overlooking The Slopes. It is a Grade-II listed building. History The building was designed in the style of a French ch√¢teau (with a Mansard roof crested with iron railings, Venetian windows and a clocktower with a cupola) by Manchester architect William Pollard (who also designed Buxton College's Gothic-style 'new building' in 1880). After the Market Hall (designed by Henry Currey) was destroyed by a fire in September 1885, the site was selected for the new town hall. The fire brigade with the town's new fire engine was unable to control the fire started by a paraffin lamp in one of the shops in the Market Hall. A competition was held in 1886 for the design of the new town hall. William Pollard's design won the ¬£50 prize and James Salt's local firm was selected to build it at a tender of ¬£8,900 (Salt also built the Entertainment Stage theatre, which is now the Pavilion Arts Centre). The chairman of the governing Local Board, Edward Milligan, laid the foundation stone in June 1887 (Queen Victoria's Jubilee year). The Marquess of Hartington conducted the official opening of the town hall in June 1889. The clock on the clock tower was a gift from the Duke of Devonshire's tenants in 1889, in honour of Lord Frederick Cavendish, who was stabbed to death aged 45 in the Phoenix Park Murders in Dublin in May 1882 (shortly after arriving to take up his new post as Chief Secretary for Ireland). There is a bust of Lord Cavendish (son of the 7th Duke of Devonshire) on display inside the town hall. Buxton Market Hall 1857-1885 The previous town hall (known as Central Hall) was located in Eagle Parade on the Market Place in Higher Buxton. The old town hall had been a meeting place for the people of the town whereas the Local Board of Buxton met at the Old Courthouse to run the town's affairs. In 1894 the Local Board evolved into the Buxton Urban District Council (UDC). In 1917 Buxton and Fairfield were combined into a single borough, with the town hall as its headquarters. The town hall was built from high quality millstone grit from the local Nithen Quarry at Corbar Hill. The arches at either side were initially open arcades but were subsequently converted into internal rooms. The town hall contained first free public library in the town. There was originally a ballroom on the first floor, which is now offices. In front of the town hall is the 15th century market cross. During the 20th century the cross was moved from the centre of the market place to sit next to the 1840 drinking fountain (at the top of Fountain Street) and later to its current position. Before 1813 (when the town was granted a market charter) it had stood on Cockerd Hill (now Palace Fields). The market cross is a Grade II listed monument. Current use High Peak Borough Council, formed in 1974, presently has administrative centres at Buxton Town Hall and Glossop Town Hall. Full Council meetings are usually held in Buxton or at Chapel-en-le-Frith Town Hall.

Individuals providing violence interruption services are known as violence interrupters. Techniques used include mediation and measures to address underlying causes of violence such as poverty. The initiatives use a public health model to prevent violence and crime by treating them as diseases. As of 2018 initiatives were in place in Washington DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore and other US cities, as well as in London and Glasgow. Violence interruption is distinct from law enforcement as an approach to ending violence, although the two approaches can sometimes be regarded as complementary to one another. The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention is an organization that links violence interruption projects to medical resources. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, violence interrupters helped encourage social distancing, hand washing, and other measures to limit viral spread and helped distribute food and supplies in the areas they served.  History  In the 1990s epidemiologist Gary Slutkin noticed similarities between the AIDS epidemic in Africa and the violence occurring in Chicago at the time, noticing that violence was happening in \\"clusters,\\" seemed to be \\"replicating itself\\", and was increasing rapidly, just like disease epidemics did. He recognized these as the three classic signs of contagious disease and decided to treat it as that. He applied for funding and started a pilot program which eventually became Cure Violence. Using a sociological technique he and colleagues had developed fighting AIDS in Uganda, he recruited former gang members as \\"Violence Interrupters\\" to do outreach. According to the BBC, \\"The results were instant; crime in its pilot area, West Garfield, dropped significantly.

Building The museum is located in the architectural monument of local significance ‚Äì the Resurrection Church and Parish School (1904), built in the complex with the Church of the Resurrection ‚Äì the tomb of Hetman Kyrylo Razumovsky in the historic center of Baturyn. The building is rectangular in plan, one-storey, brick. The architect is unknown. During its existence, the building was used as a church-parish school and kindergarten. In 2005 it was accepted on the balance of the Reserve ‚ÄúHetman's Capital‚Äù. Restoration of the monument lasted in 2005-2008. Museum History The opening of the Baturyn Museum of Archeology took place on January 22, 2009, on the Day of the Unification of Ukraine, by President Viktor Yushchenko. Exposition Museum exposition. Things of the Cossacks in the exposition. The subject of the museum covers a considerable period of time - from the appearance of the first people in Baturyn to the death of the city on November 2 (13), 1708. The exposition of the Baturyn Museum of Archeology consists of three thematic directions: ‚ÄúAncientBaturyn‚Äù, ‚ÄúBaturyn of the Cossack era‚Äù, ‚ÄúBaturyn‚Äì the Hetman's residence‚Äù. In the hall ‚ÄúAncient Baturyn‚Äù you can see the bones of mammoths and other ancient animals that walked on our land 10 thousand years ago, stone tools of the Neolithic period, a large number of jewelry from the times of Kyivan Rus, which women loved to wear. The exposition ‚ÄúBaturyn of the Cossack era‚Äù is devoted to the Lithuanian-Polish and Cossack periods of Baturyn's history, covers the time from the 14th century to 1669. Here are the products of local artisans, Cossack derivatives and household items, copies of documents and maps of the time, which comprehensively characterize the history of Baturyn in Cossack period. Unique exhibits in the exhibition are a knight's belt with silver, a silver thaler from 1622, Cossack boots, insurgent weapons and other equally interesting things. Here are wooden logs, which are more than 300 years old, that were found during excavations of the moat of the Citadel of Baturyn Fortress. The exposition ‚ÄúBaturyn ‚Äì Hetman's Residence‚Äùis dedicated to the brightest, Hetman's period, in the history of Baturyn. From 1669 to 1708 the city was the residence of the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host ‚Äì Demyan Ignatovych, Ivan Samoilovich and Ivan Mazepa. Also it was the center of political, economic and cultural life of the Hetmanate. At the peak of its rise, the Hetman's Capital was completely destroyed by the Russian army under the command of O. Menshikov on November 13 (2), 1708. The personification of the tragedy of 1708 was the burnt icon of the Mother of God with the Infant on a copper plate with traces of gilding by masters of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra of the late XVII century, which lay in the grave of an elderly woman with a broken skull.Volodymyr Mezentsev, ‚ÄúArchaeological Research of Mazepa‚Äôs Capital Baturyn in 2013-2014‚Äù, Ukrainian Echo (Toronto), vol. 28, no. 26, November 25, 2014, pp. 1-2. Eloquent witnesses of the tragedy are a fragment of a mortar cannon standing on the walls of the fortress and a fragment of a church bell. The theme of Baturyn's destruction does not leave modern artists indifferent. The masters of the brush, Andriy Ivakhnenko and Mykola Danchenko, conveyed this eerie painting in their works of art. Thanks to the planned annual excavations, the Baturyn Museum of Archeology continues to be replenished with rare findings. The museum organizes temporary exhibitions, thematic classes for students and lectures. Literature * Saienko N. Museum of Archeology of Baturyn. Chernigov, 2013. 11 p.

April 2020  Repertoire  Sebastian Knauer, whose wide-ranging and extensive repertoire stretches from the Baroque to the modern era, often brings together a unique collection of works in his programmes for concert and CD, thereby enhancing the high repertoire value of even well known works. Furthermore, Arash Safaian has composed two concerto cycles especially for him: \\"√úberBach\\" (2016) and \\"This is (not) Beethoven - Variations for Piano & Orchestra\\" (2019). In 1998 Sebastian Knauer released his debut CD, dedicated to the entire solo piano works of George Gershwin, including the seldom-heard solo version of Rhapsody in Blue. In 1999 he threw light on the Mozart family by combining father and son and recording a hitherto hardly known piano concerto by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's son Franz Xaver. He has researched the three great American composers Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland and Samuel Barber in detail and introduced many little known works to the repertoire, as was the case with the Bernstein Anniversaries. In 2004 he recorded, together with the violinist Daniel Hope, a CD entitled \\"East meets West\\", on which he played a replica of an instrument invented by Maurice Ravel, the luth√©al. 2007 saw the release of a world premiere recording of a forgotten Schubert sonata, the \\"Sonate Oubli√©e\\", discovered by J√∂rg Demus. In 2009 he dedicated a recording to the piano works ‚Äì and thus the \\"songs without words\\" ‚Äì of Felix Mendelssohn, resulting in yet another CD featuring world premieres. On \\"Bach & Sons\\" and \\"Bach & Sons 2\\" he made a comparison of the keyboard concertos of Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons Carl Philipp Emanuel and Johann Christian. Through research he discovered that Mozart's last and Beethoven's first piano concertos originated in the same year ‚Äì a combination which he recorded and released ‚Äì a world first to this day.Unkonwn Author,Diskografie, retrieved 20 May 2020  Orchestras and Concerts  Sebastian Knauer has performed on stage at many famous venues such as the Berlin Konzerthaus and the Philharmonie in Berlin, Cologne and Munich, the Gewandhaus Leipzig, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, London's Wigmore Hall, the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es in Paris, the Zurich Tonhalle, Vienna's Konzerthaus, the Auditori Barcelona, Sala Verdi in Milan, and, further afield, the Lincoln Center in New York, the Koerner Hall Toronto, the Herbst Theater in San Francisco, Knight Concert Hall Miami, the Th√©atro Municipal in both Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the Oriental Concert Hall in Shanghai, NCPA Beijing, the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing, Toppan Hall Tokyo and the Performing Arts Center in Hong Kong.

The sprint car team won multiple championships between the 1950s and 1990s while their Indycar team was active from 1975 to 1989, winning three races. The team was owned by California businessman Alex Morales who sponsored the team with his Alex Foods brand in the earlier years and was managed by chief mechanic John Capels, who later served on CART‚Äôs board of directors. Early years and Sprint Cars Alex Morales, born in 1908, came from a family that had early success in the food industry with Tamale Carts in Los Angeles. Morales started entering sprint cars in California in the 1920s and continued for several decades. His ‚ÄúTamale Wagon‚Äù sprint cars (named after one of his most popular products) enjoyed tremendous success around the tracks of California for many years, with their first championship coming in 1959 at the hands of Chuck Hulse. Morales continued to run Sprint Cars into the 1990s. Indycars, 1970s In the Mid 70‚Äôs Morales got together with former Vel‚Äôs Parnelli Jones mechanic John Capels (who left the team when they downsized) to run an Indycar team for California-based drivers. The team made their debut with driver Jimmy Caruthers running an Eagle-Offenhauser at the 1975 California 500. Sadly Carruthers passed away from Cancer in late 1975, not long after recording the team‚Äôs best result of the season, a 4th place at Michigan International Speedway. The team pressed on in 1976 with a two car effort, running Eagles for rookie Bobby Olivero and veteran Bill Vukovich II however reliability issues saw only one top 5 finish by Vukovich at Texas World Speedway. In 1977 the team scaled back to one car for most races running Vukovich in early races before Olivero took over at Indy. A switch from Eagle to Lightning chassis starting at the Indy 500 saw an uptick in results with Pancho Carter coming on board in as second car at the season ending race in Phoenix and recording the team‚Äôs best finish to date, a third-place finish. Despite some solid results early in 1978, Olivero was replaced by Mike Mosley for the second half of the season but reliability concerns limited him to three top 10 finishes. Breakthrough and success in the 80s As a result of the 1979 USAC/CART split, Morales decided to race in the CART series with Carter running their now aging Lightning Chassis, however he was only able to manage 13th in the standings as the Offenhauser engines were becoming increasingly obsolete. In 1980 Morales continued with Carter but were able to upgrade to a Penske-Cosworth combination for which saw a significant improvement as Carter finished 5th in the points, with a best finish of third at Michigan. The success with the Penske continued into 1981 as Carter won the team's first race at the Michigan 500 and finished third in the CART standings. Carter followed that up with an impressive third-place finish at the 1982 Indy 500 as the Morales team became one of early adopters of the March chassis program but the next two seasons as a whole were not as successful, not recording a single top 5 finish in both the 1982 and 1983 CART seasons (the Indy 500 was not a CART points race in 1982). For 1984 Carter was replaced by Al Holbert who, despite an impressive 4th at Indy, only finished 18th in CART points. In 1985 Morales hired 3 time Indy champion Johnny Rutherford and obtained sponsorship from Vermont American. Rutherford had a successful first two seasons for the team, winning at Sanair in 1985 (albeit under controversial circumstances after Panco Carter passed him at the line under yellow) and finished 11th in the points. In 1986 Rutherford again was 11th in the points and won Morales‚Äô third Indycar race, the 1986 Michigan 500. The team retained Rutherford for 1987 but the March Chassis was not as competitive as in previous seasons and Rutherford slipped to 18th in the standings with a best finish of 7th at Portland. Rutherford and Morales went their separate ways and the team brought in Howdy Holmes for 1988 to drive their March 88C-Cosworth package but both suppliers were falling behind rival manufacturers such as Lola, Penske and Chevrolet. As a result, Holmes wasn't able to better Rutherford‚Äôs 18th-place finish from the year before. Alfa Romeo and the end Despite the death of Alex Morales in November 1988 the team forged on as the factory Alfa Romeo team for 1989 with specially designed March chassis. Unfortunately the engine development was behind schedule and they only made their debut at the fifth round of the championship in Detroit where driver Roberto Guerrero finished 8th in what would end up being the best result of the season for the Morales Alfa Romeo as unreliability and a horsepower deficit saw Guerrero only score points in one more race, a 12th- place finish at Mid-Ohio. At the end of the season the Alfa Romeo program and Morales CART franchise was transferred to Pat Patrick whose re-founded Patrick Racing team moved into the former Morales shop in Indianapolis.

Her music mixes Arabic and Western influences. She has worked with Toshiko Akiyoshi, Rufus Reid, John Zorn, the London Jazz Orchestra, and also recorded and performed with Radiohead (on The King of Limbs), Lee Perry, ABC, Swing Out Sister, Joan as Police Woman, Tarek Yamani and Amel Zen, and the band These New Puritans.  Childhood and jazz debut  Born in London to a British mother and a Bahraini father, Ahmed spent her childhood in Bahrain before returning to London at the age of nine. She started playing the trumpet at an early age, encouraged by her maternal grandfather Terry Brown, a jazz trumpet player. She completed a master's degree from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. During this time she formed her own group, with whom she recorded her debut album, Finding My Way Home, in 2011, which inaugurates her exploration of the fusion of Jazz and Arabic music. She represented Bahrain at the London Cultural Olympiad in 2012, where she collaborated with the musicians of Transglobal Underground. The resulting project, In Transit, was supported by the British Council in Dubai and London. Alhaan Al Siduri, a suite written with the support of Birmingham Jazzlines, was premiered in October 2015 at the CBSO Centre in Birmingham. The work is influenced by Ahmed's Bahraini roots, mixing the folk music of pearl divers and traditional wedding songs sung by women. Its second performance, at the Bahrain International Music Festival in 2016, marked Yazz Ahmed's debut in her native country. She was then commissioned by Tomorrow's Warriors, with support from the Women Make Music Foundation, to write a suite about \\"Powerful and Inspirational Women\\". This led to the London premiere of Polyhymnia in 2015, performed by an all-female cast of the Nu Civilization Orchestra, at the WOW! festival in London, on the occasion of International Women's Day in March 2015.  International recognition  In 2017, her album La Saboteuse earned her international acclaim. It was named Jazz Album of the Year by The Wire, and ranked 18th in Bandcamp's Top 100 Albums (all genres). Previously, during her year as a composer at the LSO Soundhub, she had a quarter-tone flugelhorn specially made, allowing her to use scales specific to Arabic music, and to get closer to the spiritual nature of the \\"blues notes\\". In August 2018, La Saboteuse Remixed was released, an EP of collaborations with three European electronic DJs: Hector Plimmer, DJ Khalab and Blacksea N√£o Maya. Four of the tracks of the original album (The Lost Pearl, Jamil Jamal, Al Emadi and Spindrifting) were reinterpreted and then reached a new audience. Shortly afterwards, The Planets 2018 was created especially for a tour of planetariums, on the occasion of the celebration of the centenary of Gustav Holst's suite The Planets and Modern Astronomy. Commissioned by the Ligeti Quartet, Saturn was presented and performed throughout the UK during October 2018. Continuing her explorations of space, Ahmed was then commissioned by the Open University to write a piece inspired by the moon, which was performed at Moon Night in December 2018. Ahmed released her third album, Polyhymnia, in 2019. Named after the Greek muse of music, poetry and dance, a character whom Ahmed describes as \\"a goddess for the arts\\", it is a six-movement suite devoted to \\"six women of exceptional qualities, role models with whom [she] felt a strong bond\\": Rosa Parks, Malala Yousafzai, Ruby Bridges, Haaifa Al- Mansour, Barbara Thompson and the Suffragettes. Since it was first created in 2015, the project has grown, Yazz Ahmed adding new elements and expanding the group of collaborators. The recordings took place in UK and Europe over a three-year period from 2016 to 2019.

Early Life  Born in Laurens County, South Carolina, John Bolt Culbertson was the sixth of thirteen children to John Dennis Culbertson and Lucia Bell Culbertson (nee Bolt). He attended the University of South Carolina, working as a waiter and as delivering papers to pay for tuition, graduating with his law degree in 1934. He worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for two years as a special agent in the Midwest during J. Edgar Hoover's \\"War on Crime\\" Culbertson would later say his time in Detroit, Michigan, helped shape his views and sympathies for the working class. In 1937, Culbertson started a law practice in Greenville, focusing on labor relations. He would work as an attorney until he was drafted into the Army in 1943, a period that also included an unsuccessful run for the South Carolina House of Representative. In the Army, he served in the infantry and as an investigator throughout World War II.  Career  In 1947, Culbertson served on a team of defense attorneys for the 28 men accused of lynching Willie Earle, who was accused of robbing and murdering a cab driver. This would be a turning point in Culbertson's struggle between his personal convictions against segregation and racism and his career. Later, Culbertson would say: > \\"I decided life wouldn't have any real meaning unless a man was willing to > make a sacrifice for the things he believed in and to stand up for his > convictions. ...If I was willing to give up my life - which I was - for the > idea of freedom in other countries, I ought to be willing as a citizen to > give real meaning to the slogans of democracy at home.\\" In 1948, Culbertson was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives where he served for one term in 1949 and 1950. He was involved in the passage of the first occupational disease law for the state. Culbertson would go on to run as a Democrat variety of races including for Greenville mayor (1951), U.S. Congress (1965 and 1980), U.S. Senate (1968, 1972, and 1978), and Governor (1974). Although his frequent campaigns did not result in his election, they reinforced his role as a champion for liberal causes in the state of South Carolina. Culbertson continued to work as an attorney in Greenville on cases of worker's compensation and labor unions in textile mills, including a case of worker's compensation against J.P. Stephens Co. Inc. (now WestPoint Home). While never on the payroll, Culbertson was a major player in the South Carolina NAACP. He traveled among South Carolina's 46 counties, calling for integration and for people to join the organization. He also worked to try and force the courts to admit African-Americans onto South Carolina's jury pools. In 1955, his membership drives saw 3,000 members join the state branch. Culbertson died of cancer in Houston, Texas on March 21, 1983, after seeking treatment at M.D. Anderson Hospital.

His family came to Brazil as a refugee because his father, a great leader of the Catholic movement, converted to Protestantism and suffered a lot of persecution from Catholic ecclesiastical authorities. He was the main precursor in Brazil of the Worship Movement. The singer has received several awards, such as Talento and Promessas Awards.  Biography  Quinlan's ministry in Brazil started mentored by the couple of American charismatic missionaries, Dan and Marti Duke, for whom he worked as a music minister and interpreter. Eight years later, he was sent by his leaders to continue his work independently, thus becoming the head of the \\"Fogo e Gl√≥ria\\" Ministry, later called \\"Paix√£o, Fogo e Gl√≥ria\\", through which he conducts praise conferences and worship in different cities. He is married to Bebel Quinlan, with whom he has two daughters, Danny and Angel. Guitarist and vocalist, he recorded translated versions of worship-style songs composed by English-speaking worship leaders such as Matt Redman, Martin Smith, Paul Baloche and internationally acclaimed worship groups such as Hillsong and Vineyard Music. On his albums, however, he has predominantly recorded his own compositions. Through his contract with the Som Livre label, in 2012 the singer recorded in the studio the album Um Lugar para Dois, which featured several special guest appearances. The duet with singer Ana Paula Valad√£o on the song \\"Vem Dan√ßar\\" became the most popular song on the album.

It was formed by Cassa Pancho in 2001 as a response to the lack of professional Black and Asian ballet dancers in the UK. The Company was to provide dancers and students of black and Asian descent with inspiring opportunities in classical ballet. Based in Marylebone, London, Ballet Black are a touring company with 8 dancers and an extensive repertoire of specially commissioned choreography from both established and emerging choreographers. Ballet Black achieved charity status in 2004. Its patrons are Thandie Newton OBE and Kwame Kwei-Armah OBE, and Althea Efunshile is the chair of the trustees. Arts Council England made Ballet Black a National Portfolio Organisation (NPO) for 2018-2022 and awarded them ¬£880,000. In addition to the professional performing company, Ballet Black also has a junior ballet school for ages 3 to 18. The classes are held in Shepherd's Bush, West London and the teachers include director Cassa Pancho and Senior Artist Cira Robinson. The junior school is a key part of the work of Ballet Black, and is essential to creating, building and sustaining the future of diversity in ballet. The company has made a list of actions resources available on their website so that other companies and dance schools can made active steps to become inclusive and anti-racist. Ballet Black have been nominated for several awards including The Critics' Circle National Dance Awards, Sky Arts, and Oliviers. In the 2012 National Dance Awards (announced Jan 2013) they won the Grishko Award for the Best Independent Company, and in the 2018 awards their dancer Jos√© Alves won Outstanding Male Dancer in Classical Performance, while Cathy Marston won Best Classical Choreography, both for work on The Suit. Other nominations included the company's Arthur Pita's nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance in 2014 for his choreography of A Dream Within A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the same piece receiving a nomination for the 2015 Sky Arts award for dance. Ballet Black have featured in documentaries including The South Bank Show in 2016 and BBC Four's Danceworks. A collaboration with dance shoe company Freed of London was announced in 2018. Freed added two new colours, \\"Ballet Bronze\\" and \\"Ballet Brown\\" to their range of pointe shoes. This meant that dancers with skin colours other than white would no longer have to pancake their shoes with foundation to make them match their skin tones. Over a year a professional dancer gets through many pairs of shoes, sometimes a pair per performance as well as those used for daily classes and rehearsals, so the saved labour and expense for many Black and Asian dancers is incalculable.

Near the bottom of the page are the names of seven legendary dukes, who came after P≈ôemysl, the Ploughman. The Chronica Boemorum (Chronicle of the Czechs, or Bohemians) is the first Latin chronicle in which the history of the Czech lands has been consistently and relatively fully described. It was written in 1119-1125 by Cosmas of Prague. The manuscript includes information about historical events in Czech land from ancient times to the first quarter of the 12th century. At the same time, the Chronicle is not limited to Czech national historiography, also revealing the relationship between various European states in the 10th‚Äì12th centuries. The author of the chronicle was the dean of the chapter of St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague Cosmas of Prague. Being a valuable historical source, especially as it relates to events whose contemporary was Cosmas, the Czech Chronicle in many respects set the direction for the subsequent development of the Czech annals. The chronicler worked on the chronicle until his death in 1125. Despite some inaccuracies and a vivid expression of the author‚Äôs own position, the scientific level is high for that era and the importance of the events described in it put Cosmas of Prague into one of the most significant chroniclers of medieval Europe. The Chronica was continued by various, collectively called Cosmas's continuators, down to 1300.

John Biddulph Martin (1841-1897) was an English banker and statistician. Early Life Martin was born on the 10th of June 1841, in Eaton Square, London, the second son of Robert Martin, of Overbury Court, Tewkesbury. He was educated at Harrow School and Exeter College, Oxford, graduating from the latter in 1862. Banking career Martin worked for the family business of Martins Bank from 1864. Publications His paper on \\"Our Gold Coinage\\", 1882, an able statistical inquiry into its defective condition at the time, with extremely careful statements showing the depreciation of the coinage from 1817, the date when UK gold coinage was resumed, was of great service in promoting the late 19th century reform of the gold currency. This paper appeared in the Journal of the Bankers' Institute, to which, as well as to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, he was a frequent and valued contributor. He was President of the last-named Society at the time of his death. His article on \\"The Evolution of our Banking System\\" in the Economic Journal for 1891 is a very able sketch of the growth of the business, written as it only could have been by a man who had an accurate knowledge both of the history of the past and of the practice of present times. The most important work by John Biddulph Martin was \\"The Grasshopper\\" in Lombard Street, a history of Martins Bank. The bank was at one time the property of Sir Thomas Gresham, whose crest, the Grasshopper, the name commemorates. Sportsman Martin played football for Wanderers F.C. between 1865 and 1870. He played for \\"London\\" in the historic London v Sheffield football match of 1866, scoring a goal and a touch down. At the time of his death, he was president of the London Athletic Club. Family Martin's elder brother, Richard B. Martin, was a Member of Parliament for Droitwich from 1892 to 1906. In 1883, Martin married American suffragist Victoria Woodhull.

Allan (January 19, 1861-August 13, 1938) was an American attorney and politician from Maine. Allan, a Republican from Portland, served five terms in the Maine House of Representatives between 1901 and 1938. He was elected in 1900, 1902, 1916, 1918, and 1936. He died prior to the completion of his fifth term and is buried at Portland's Evergreen Cemetery. Women's suffrage Allan was a prominent supporter of women's suffrage and either introduced or drafted bills to the Maine Legislature in support of women's suffrage on three occasions. In 1903, during his second term in office, he introduced a bill to give women taxpayers suffrage in state elections, which was defeated. In 1913, while out of office, Allan drafted a resolve in favor of full suffrage, which was introduced by Sen. Ira G. Hersey. This measure passed both the House and Senate but failed to garner the necessary two-thirds support to be sent to the voters for ratification. In 1919, Allan, then in his fourth term, prepared a law granting full suffrage in presidential election passed both the House and Senate later that month. Anti-suffragists organized a people's veto petition drive which forced a statewide vote on the measure. However, in August 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed granting women the right to vote nationwide which was ratified by Maine in November 1919. However, the petition drive had previously been deemed constitutional by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and a vote was held on Maine's amendment in 1920, which, with women now enfranchised, passed overwhelmingly.

The six-story building contains a French-inspired facade and mansard roof, as well as 276 panes of glass on the third through fifth floors, which comprise the only documented architectural work by Ren√© Lalique in the United States. The Coty Building forms the base of the adjoining skyscraper at 712 Fifth Avenue. Built as a brownstone rowhouse in 1871, it was redesigned in 1907‚Äì1908 by architect Woodruff Leeming. It was commissioned by owner and real estate investor Charles A. Gould, who, foreseeing the neighborhood shift from residential to commercial use, wished to replace the facade of the brownstone. Upon its completion in 1910, the building was leased to perfumer Fran√ßois Coty. Coty then commissioned Lalique to design large glass windows on the third through fifth floors. Though Coty moved out during 1941, the building would continue to be referred to as the Coty Building. Since 1985, it has been a New York City designated landmark.  History  Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and Central Park South (59th Street) was relatively undeveloped through the late 19th century. 714 Fifth Avenue was built in 1871 as a brownstone rowhouse, one of several on the western side of Fifth Avenue between 55th and 56th streets. By the early 1900s, that section of Fifth Avenue was becoming a commercial area. 714 Fifth Avenue was redesigned in 1907-1908 by architect Woodruff Leeming; the project was commissioned by owner and real estate investor Charles A. Gould, who, foreseeing the neighborhood shift from residential to commercial use, wished to replace the facade of the brownstone. In 1910, the 6-story building with its new French-inspired facade and Mansard roof was leased to perfumer Fran√ßois Coty, who would use the building as his headquarters in the United States. Coty commissioned jeweler and glass maker Ren√© Lalique to design a wall of glass windows. Lalique created a Art Nouveau- style composition of panes of glass decorated with flower vines, large enough to go from the third through fifth floors. The original lease extended till 1931 and was renewed until 1951, but after Coty‚Äôs death in 1934, Coty, Inc. remained at 714 Fifth Avenue only until 1941, when it moved operations to its other quarters at 423 West 55th Street. The building's 276 masterwork panes of glass were gradually covered by grime.  Architecture  The six-story Coty Building's facade is a glass wall surrounded by a frame. The first two stories have limestone-faced piers and a cornice supported by corbel brackets; they are treated as a single continuous section of the facade. The third through fifth stories are also treated as a single wall of glass, surrounded by a limestone frame with architrave motif at the top and bellflower pendants motifs on each side. Cast-steel spandrels are located above the third and fourth stories. There are five vertical window bays, separated by thin vertical steel mullions. The general articulation remains unchanged from its original construction, although the original casement windows were removed and replaced with the Lalique glass windows. Each bay consists of a multi-paned casement separated by a transom. The central bays contain clear glass, though decorative glass is located in the side bays. There is an arched, scallop- shaped pediment with small brackets above the third floor. Each pane is about thick, surrounded by metal frames; the exterior of each frame is raised. The third- through fifth-story facade contains intertwining vine and flower designs, which according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission are possibly poppies. The top floor is set off by a modillioned cornice with console brackets supporting a balustrade. The sloping metal- covered roof with its arched dormers allowed the building to harmonize with its neighbors. From the street, the windows (a modification from the original design) are the building's most striking feature. It is the only documented Lalique architectural work in the United States.  Preservation  In 1983, developer David S. Solomon began planning the construction of a new 44 story office skyscraper with entrances on West 56th Street and on Fifth Avenue. Since neither the Coty Building nor the adjacent Rizzoli Building at 712 Fifth Avenue were designated as official landmarks, his intent was to replace them. In 1984, architectural historian Andrew Dolkart noticed the grime-covered windows above an electronics store at 714 Fifth Avenue. Upon further research, albeit not signed, it was discovered that these windows were exquisite Art Nouveau work by Lalique and should be preserved on site rather than displaced into a museum. The Municipal Art Society advocated for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to give the building official-landmark status, and both were designated in early 1985. The Landmarks Preservation Commission also approved a Certificate of Appropriateness that allowed the new skyscraper, 712 Fifth Avenue, to be erected behind the existing buildings. The skyscraper thus had to be built with the Coty Building at its base, incorporating the old facades in the design. Steadsol Fifth Associates, which was developing the skyscraper, had its alteration permits for the Coty Building revoked following the landmark designations. In 1986, the Greenland Studio in Manhattan restored the 276 Lalique panels, measuring , which had been removed from the facade. Of these, 46 panels were replaced with replicas made by Jon Smiley Glass Studios in Philadelphia. In 1990, Beyer Blinder Belle restored the facade for the opening of new tenant Henri Bendel's flagship store in New York City. Inside, the former Coty offices were removed and a four-story atrium was added. Further restoration occurred in 2000, after water erosion had caused some of the steel frames to expand, cracking ten panes. One author wrote, \\"This type of hybrid preservation [...] with a balance between development and preservation is politically and economically essentiel in modern cities.\\"  References  Bibliography    External links  * Image of the block circa 1980, Collections of the Museum of the City of New York by Edmund Vincent Gillon Category:Fifth Avenue Category:Corporate headquarters in the United States Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan Category:Commercial buildings in Manhattan Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:Art Nouveau architecture in New York City Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1910 ","title":"Coty Building"},{"id":"64222671","text":"Otto Soltermann was a Swiss footballer who played as Striker.

Influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and her academia background, she wrote about citizenship, civil society, democracy, development, ethnicity, gender, globalisation, human rights, identity, nationality and the state in an African and Senegalese context by using a political insight. Diaw worked for the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA), Bellagio Study and Conference Center of the Rockfeller Foundation, National UNESCO Sub-Commission on Social Sciences and Humanities, West African Research Association, the National UNESCO Sub-Commission on Social Sciences and Humanities and the Philosophical and Epistemological Research Center of the Doctoral School Studies.

Diaw enrolled at the Lyc√©e Paul C√©zanne preparatory school in Aix-en-Provence and earned a dipl√¥me d'√©tudes universitaires g√©n√©rales in philosophy. The following year, she went to the Lyc√©e Mass√©na in Nice to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy and a DEUG 2 before earning a master's degree from the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in 1981. Diaw finished her studying with a postgraduate diploma and dissertation on the theory of conflicts of the political thinking of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which earned her the Tr√®s Bien distinction from the jury by a unanimous decision. She completed a doctorate degree with first class honours from the same institution in 1985.

In 1990, Diaw was made a lecturer and lectured for one year at the private Higher Management Institute school in Dakar. Two years later, she was appointed one of the first laureates of the first edition of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) on Democratic Governance, a Pan-African academic research organisation, publishing the monograph D√©mocratie et logiques identitaires en Afrique on behalf of the institute, In 1994, Diaw wrote L'invention de la politique en Afrique and Repenser la soci√©t√© civile in 1998.

She took part in the National Conference of Senegal from 2007 to 2009, defending with the politician Penda Mbow on retaining secularism in the constitution. and wrote Women Writing Africa in November 2005, which was published by Feminist Press in New York. She led the Philosophical and Epistemological Research Center of the Doctoral School Studies (CEREPHE) from July 2009 on. Diaw supported women's rights through being secretary general of the National UNESCO Sub-Commission on Social Sciences and Humanities (COSEF), and was a member of the Senegalese Women Association of University Graduates and African Women Workers Network. Her work with COSEF saw her discuss the democratisation and women's position within this movement and the debate on gender parity with the Senegalese Lawyers' Association. From June 2010, Diaw worked as a senior programme officer of CODESRIA's Training, Grant and Fellowship Division, and worked on its collaboration with UNESCO, UN Women and the UNESCO National Commissions on a project about the women's movement and gender-related violence in The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal from 2011 to 2012.

Diaw died from illness at the Hospital Center University De Fann in the night of 14 April 2017. Analysis and legacy According to Dior Konat√©, who wrote Diaw's entry in the Dictionary of African Biography, Rousseau's political thoughts and her background in academia influenced her to employ their theoretical insights to comment on Senegalese current affairs such as citizenship, civil society, democracy, development, ethnicity, gender, globalisation, human rights, identity, nationality and the state in an African and Senegalese context. She observed the connections between gender, politics and power in Africa from both a feminist and philosophical viewpoint. A ceremony to honour her life took place at the West African Research Center on 20 December 2017. On 3 May 2018, a second tribute for Diaw was hosted by three faculty members at a conference room in UCAD organised by its rectorate, the Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences, its Department of Philosophy, the Directorate of Cultural and Scientific Animation and the UCAD Foundation.

Many of his letters remain. He was born in Charleston, South Carolina to George and Mary E. Weston McKinlay. He studied at Avery Institute, West Point, Iowa College and the University of South Carolina. His years at the University of South Carolina during the Reconstruction era when it was opened up to African Americans ended when Democrats regained control. He was elected to serve in South Carolina's 1868 legislature along with numerous other African Americans and Republicans. He married Kate Wheeler and moved to Washington D.C. as conditions for African Americans deteriorated for African Americans in South Carolina. Washington D.C. became less inclusive in the years after their arrival as Democrats held power and Jim Crow era segregstion took hold. McKinlay was invited to attend the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922. He and other African American guests learned they were to be segregated in a separate section upon arrival.

It was the first nursing organization in America with this mission and existed from 1973 through the early 1980s. Pre-history and founding In 1972, a panel discussion on homosexuality was held at the American Nurses Association (ANA) convention. The panel focused on the need to overcome stigma against lesbian and gay patients and nurses. Speakers on the panel included two gay nurses and a sociologist, drawing an audience of 2500. Following that convention, E. Carolyn Innes and G. David Waldron co-founded the Gay Nurses Alliance (GNA) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in August 1973 to advocate for gay patients and nurses and educate health care professionals and others. Encouraged by her mentor Barbara Gittings, Innes approached Waldron with the idea of establishing a gay caucus within the American Nurses Association. Innes had volunteered for the influential lesbian publication The Ladder in the 1950s, and, in 1972, Innes organized the first gay pride parade in Philadelphia alongside Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin. Growth and response In October 1973, GNA members gave the presentation \\"Gay People/Straight Health Care\\" at the Pennsylvania Nurses Association conference. Although they were not officially recognized by the association or conference, response to the talk was so positive that they repeated it to another packed room the following morning. A 1974 letter to the American Journal of Nursing from Howard J. Brown, MD, a pioneer of LGBT health, praised GNA as \\"a beacon of hope to homosexuals\\". Chapters of the GNA were established in Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City. Chapter membership fees, combined with personal funds, enabled Innes and Waldron to attend the American Nurses Association Convention in San Francisco. They also began doing numerous speaking engagements, using a slide show created by member Jeri Dilno. Dilno was the photographer and graphic designer for the GNA newsletter THE SIGNAL and the designer of the GNA button. Other key members included Tony Amadeo, who was the head of the Pennsylvania caucus, and Bob Simco, GNA's business manager. GNA collaborated with other groups, including a conference in Boston on women and health in 1975 that attracted 1500 attendees. In 1977, GNA had its first annual conference and G. David Waldron, GNA's co-founder, was appointed to the ANA's Commission on Human Rights. Though the organization continued to grow, by 1978 the lack of member involvement prompted John C. Lawrence and Bob Miller, the president and secretary of the GNA, respectively, to consider disbanding unless others stepped forward. By the early 1980s, the Alliance had become defunct.

King Leopold II of Belgium was commemorated here as a benefactor of Ostend and the Belgian Congo. The inauguration was on 19 July 1931. The statue was vandalised in 2020 as part of the global Black Lives Matter movement after the death of George Floyd. A petition to remove such statues is ongoing until 30 June 2020, the 60th anniversary of Congo's independence from Belgium.  History  While Leopold was alive, Thomas Vin√ßotte produced a portrait bust which is now in the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken. L√©opold II by Thomas Vin√ßotte - Laeken Royal Greenhouses Shortly after Leopold died in 1909, plans started to honour him, as a benefactor of Ostend and the Belgian Congo. After the First World War, the city government started work on plans for a statue. Sculptor Alfred Courtens (1889-1967), was commissioned, together with his brother, the architect, Antoine Courtens (1899-1969). The City Council may have hoped to regain the dynasty as summer residents but after Leopold II's death, Ostend's status as a royal summer residence quickly crumbled. On 22 September 1981 the statue was declared a protected monument.  Description  The monument is known locally as \\"De Drie Gapers\\". The middle of the three passages was made on the sea side. The monument has an important architectural part that roughly consists of a voluminous upright column, with two horizontal bases on the left and right. This gives a form of a kind of double L monogram (two L's turned away from each other), the monogram that Leopold II often used. On top in bronze, Leopold II sits in military uniform on horseback looking over the North Sea. At the bottom left a larger than life sculptural group, also in bronze, depicting \\"Thanks of the Congolese to Leopold II for freeing them from slavery among the Arabs\\". On the right, a pendant, depicting \\"Tribute of the Ostend fishing population\\".  Controversy =Congo Free State Map of the Congo Free State, c. 1890 Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State; a private project was undertaken on his behalf. He used explorer Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorised his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improve the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, Leopold ignored these conditions and millions of Congolese inhabitants, including children, was mutilated and killed. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death. Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber. Under his regime millions of Congolese people died. Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration in 1908.  Vandalism  The Equestrian statue of King Leopold II has been vandalised in 2004 and 2020. In 2004 an activist group, De Stoete Ostendenoare, symbolically cut off a bronze hand from one of the kneeling Congolese slaves who, as part of the 'Gratitude of the Congolese' group in the monument, honours Leopold II. This was a reference to how Congolese slaves' hands were cut off if they did not produce enough rubber during Leopold's colonial regime. The activists were willing to give the hand back if a historically correct sign would be placed near the statue. On 9 June 2020, Ostend mayor Bart Tommelein said that the city council \\"takes the fight against racism very seriously\\" but \\"replacing or removing statues will not happen\\".

He is known for his pioneering research in the field of structural biology, especially studies on protein folding and the relationship between protein aggregates and diseases such as cancer, prion diseases and Parkinson's disease. Jerson is a Full Professor at the Leopoldo de Meis Institute of Medical Biochemistry (IBqM) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and Coordinator of the National Institute of Science and Technology in Structural Biology and Bioimaging (INBEB), as well as Emeritus Director of the National Center for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Jiri Jonas (CNRMN), which is part of the National Center for Structural Biology and Bioimaging (CENABIO). He is also the current president of the Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ).  Personal life  The son of a sergeant in the navy and a housewife who sold homemade sweets, Jerson Lima grew up in the suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His first contact with the scientific method came during high school, when he studied at the Federal Technical School of Chemistry in Rio de Janeiro (ETFQ-RJ) (current Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro). He is married to UFRJ researcher and professor Debora Foguel. Together they have had four children.  Education and scientific career  Jerson Lima graduated in Medicine at UFRJ in 1984. He began his scientific career while still undergraduate, having joined the laboratory team led by Professor Sergio Verjovski Almeida, in the Department of Medical Biochemistry, directed at the time by the physician and researcher Leopoldo de Meis. There he conducted studies on the structure and function of the calcium-transporting protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. In 1987, Jerson completed his PhD graduation in Physics at the Carlos Chagas Filho Institute of Biophysics, also at UFRJ, under the advisory of Verjovski Almeida. He focused his research on oligomeric proteins and icosahedral viruses. In his studies, he adopted different methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. Due to his experience in adopting fluorescence techniques, shortly after his MD graduation, Jerson also obtained a postdoctoral position at the University of Illinois, in Gregorio Weber‚Äôs laboratory, where he stayed from 1985 to 1986. Between 1991 and 1992, he returned to Weber's laboratory, this time as a visiting researcher and fellow at the Guggenheim Foundation. With Weber, he deepened his knowledge of proteins, including protein plasticity, supramolecular structures, and their physiological effects. At that time, in collaboration with Professor Jiri Jonas, he also perfected his techniques for advanced fluorescence and for nuclear magnetic resonance of proteins subjected to pressure.  Scientific contributions  Jerson Lima has made several scientific contributions to the areas of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, being a pioneer in the study of the prion-like and amyloidogenic behavior of the p53 protein and its relationship with different types of cancer. His work has led to advances in the understanding of protein folding, viral assembly, and the mechanisms responsible for the formation of protein aggregates and misfolding of proteins. He specifically showed how these last two are responsible for the pathophysiology of several diseases, including different types of cancer, prion diseases (such as the bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as Mad Cow disease, and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), and Parkinson's disease.  Academic management and leadership  Throughout his scientific career, Jerson Lima has exercised several academic management functions, in addition to integrating important scientific associations and institutions. He has been a professor at the Institute of Medical Biochemistry Leopoldo de Meis (IBqM) at UFRJ since 1988. He is a full member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (ABC) since 1998, having served on the board of directors of this institution from 2007 to 2010. He is also a member of the World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) for the Advancement of Science in Developing Countries since 2006, and of the Brazilian National Academy of Medicine (ANM), in the Section of Applied Sciences to Medicine, since 2011, when he became one of the youngest full members of the centennial Academy. In the 1990s, he coordinated the foundation of the Jiri Jonas Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Center (CNRMN), inaugurated in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1999. CNRMN was the first research center in Brazil to make NMR structures of macromolecules and today is part of CENABIO, the largest NMR center in Latin America. Between 2005 and 2008, he coordinated the Millennium Institute of Structural Biology in Biomedicine and Biotechnology (IMBEBB) and since 2008 he coordinates the National Institute of Science and Technology in Structural Biology and Bioimaging (INBEB), having participated in the creation of both institutes. From 2008 to 2012, he was president of the Brazilian Society of Biophysics (SBBF), and, from 2014 to 2016, president of the Brazilian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (SBBQ). In 2019, he became president of FAPERJ, his current position, having served as scientific director of the foundation from 2003 to 2018.  Awards and honors  For his contributions to science, Jerson Lima has been awarded numerous prizes and honors, such as: * John Simon Guggenheim Foundation (1991) * Howard Hughes Medical Institute (1997-2002) * National Order of Scientific Merit by the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil, in the class of Commander (2002) and Great Cross (2009) * TWAS Prize in Biology (2005) * Gregorio Weber Award for Excellence in Fluorescence Theory and Applications, from the American Biophysical Society (2018)  References  External links  * Lattes curriculum * Google Scholar * Leopoldo de Meis Institute of Medical Biochemistry * Orcid * Research Gate * Twitter Category:1960 births Category:Living people ","title":"Jerson Lima Silva"},{"id":"64223052","title":"One Day When I Grow Up"},{"id":"64223061","text":"Super Queeroes is a Canadian multimedia web project, which launched in 2019 on CBC Arts.

The blast claimed the lives of 45 people which later increased to 69 and leaving scores of people injured. Two residential apartments collapsed due to the explosion. Initially, media reports suggested that this blast incident was connected to the Bombay Serial Blast, which occurred just 4 days before. However, these reports were dismissed. According to some witnesses, the intensity of the blasts were so high that the sounds of explosions can be heard till 3 miles away. Background In 1993, Mohammed Rashid Khan, a local gambling don ran criminal business in Bowbazaar area. He had a secret workshop above his office to make small bombs and explosives. After the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 and the riots that followed, Khan, along with his Muslim brothers made plans to bomb parts of the city to kill Hindus residing in the city. So he began stocking up huge amounts of explosives. Preparations were made secretly until on midnight of 16 March, the entire stock blew up accidentally. Had the blast occurred in the daytime, the death toll would have been more. Also if Khan managed to succeed in his plans, then huge number of people would have died to the serial bombings. Aftermath The prime accused, Khan and five others were sentenced to life imprisonment under Terrorist And Disruptive (Prevention) Act (TADA) in 2001 by Calcutta High Court. In 2015, the State Government, under Mamata Banerjee planned to release Khan, then 62 years due to his good conduct in prison.

Beginning in the late 1990s, Urban Lounge became a prominent music venue in Edmonton with a weekly open mic and one of the largest stages for the city's local music scene. The venue was owned by Edmonton entrepreneur Tim Fuhr.  Construction and specs  The initial 8111 105 St building was a standalone west-facing structure with a patio. In 2005, Urban Lounge relocated to the second floor of Old Strathcona's 10544 82 Avenue building. The venue's original location was not as well-equipped for live music as the second location. For example, in December 2000, Canadian band Our Lady Peace was scheduled to perform at Urban Lounge as part of a \\"small club tour\\" promoting their album Spiritual Machines; several days before the concert however, the Edmonton Journal wrote that \\"according to Sony, the Urban Lounge was too small to accommodate the band's equipment and stage gear,\\" so the concert changed venues. The 10544 82 Avenue building was made of reinforced concrete and had four tenant businesses on the main floor. In March 2007, the roof of Urban Lounge collapsed requiring extensive repair and renovation. When Urban Lounge reopened in 2007 following renovations, owner Tim Fuhr stated \\"we brought in a $300,000 sound-and-light show. It's all state-of-the-art production.

Life and work  Alice Gruner was born in Estonia in 1846, moving to England with her sister, Joan, at the age of 18. She became a naturalised British subject in 1896. Between 1883-1886 she was a student at Newnham College, Cambridge. Gruner tutored Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones for the Girton College entrance exams, on the recommendation of Emily Davies. Joan Gruner, Alice's sister, had been a student at Girton 1874-1877, as well as at Trinity College, Dublin, and was a school principal. In 1887, Gruner was among the founders of the Women's University Settlement, Southwark. Alongside Gruner and other Cambridge University graduates, the original committee included educationist Helen Gladstone and social reformer Octavia Hill. Following the example of the growing University Settlement movement, their aim was to \\"promote the welfare of the poorer districts of London, more especially of the women and children, by devising and advancing schemes which tend to elevate them, and by giving them additional opportunities in education and recreation\\". For twenty years, Gruner was also Secretary to the Association of University Women Teachers, founded to protect the interests and improve the position of women teachers at the university level. Here, her 'experience and untiring devotion to the work made her a most valuable adviser both to those who offered and those who were seeking educational posts.' Her obituary in The Times noted that in this role 'she helped to raise the status of women teachers, and the standard of education in schools'. Gruner also worked for the cause of women's suffrage.

Raissnia manipulates cinema's structural elements in loop installations and live performances. She often alters and tunes the mechanical parts of her film projectors, relying on her hand and playing them similarly to the way musicians play instruments. Raissnia presented a solo exhibition in 2017-2018 at the Drawing Center in New York, and in 2016, her work was the subject of a solo presentation at the Museum of Modern Art, also in New York. Her work has also been featured in the 56th Venice Biennale, All the World's Futures, curated by Okwui Enwezor and has been included in group exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and at The Kitchen in New York, among others.  Early life and career  Raissnia grew up in Tehran during the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79. She cites her trips to the city center with her father, an amateur photographer, to document the protests against the Shah as a formative experience. In 1983, Raissnia and her mother left Iran and emigrated to Houston, Texas. She received a B.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1992, and a M.F.A. from Pratt Institute in 2002. From 1995-1999, Raissnia worked at the Anthology Film Archives. Her exposure to avant-garde filmmaking during this time has deeply influenced her practice. She held her first solo show there in 2002, followed by her first performance work, Systems in collaboration with Briggan Krauss at the Thomas Erben Gallery (New York) in 2004.  Work  Raissnia's paintings, drawings, films, and performances are interdependent, drawing equally from \\"the gestural and photographic, the figurative and abstract.\\"At key in her practice are qualities specific to still and moving imagery, which are often differentiated and combined. She renders \\"their boundaries ambiguous by manipulating and layering her source materials\\", and subsequently, her works have aspects of both but belong to neither. In describing her works, Raissnia has said: \\"My paintings brought abstraction to the vision I captured from the world on film and now the films are bringing elements of reality into my paintings.\\" In addition, Raissnia uses drawing to investigate how films and paintings influence one another. Amber Harper at The Drawing Center has remarked that Raissnia's work \\"speaks to the possibility of drawing, above all, as a way to revisit, abstract, question, and change the images we use to construct identity.\\" In this way, Raissnia's works continually generate levels of signification and interpretation that coexist. Music and sound also play a crucial role in Raissnia's practice, both inspiring and forming completed works. In BOMB magazine, Jeanne Liotta has commented that Raissnia \\"made a painting and bombarded it with light and sound\\", resulting in a \\"wild ephemeral synaesthesia\\". In another instance, Milton Cruz has described Raissnia's drawings as \\"intricate rhythms and musical modulations\\". Raissnia has stated that her work \\"aspires to music and develops like a musical piece.\\"  Major Works  In 2006, Raissnia held Stele, her first solo show at Miguel Abreu Gallery. Her gestural paintings were described as \\"sanded to an absolute smoothness, a silky finish at odds with the angularity of content\\", while the drawings were detailed as being \\"so packed, so thick, their shiny skein becomes almost reflective...\\" In her second solo show at the gallery, Raissnia presented Free Way, a film installation consisting of collaged 16 and 35 mm filmstrips with hand-processed, hand-painted, and manipulated materials pressed between glass slides. Accompanied by Charles Curtis's minimalist soundtrack, Free Way included segments of still life photograph with paint and ink drawings reworked and scratched into acetate sheets, as well as sections from human x-rays. The filmmaking process is developed by breaking apart the cinematic movements of film into three components: three slides are projected side-by-side and partly overlap in the middle, while an 18 frame per second 16mm film is superimposed over the left image. This results in a slow-moving montage that is both temporary and aleatory. The New Yorker noted that \\"the ghosts of Moholy-Nagy, the Russian Constructivists, and Stan Brakhage haunt[ed]\\" the show. Raissnia presented a film-performance installation Glean at Gallery Marta Cervera in 2010. The exhibition consisted of Glean, a footage shot with super 8mm film which was hand painted and transferred to 16mm film; a series of oil on canvas; and drawings on graphite. Reviewing the show for Revista Claves de Arte, Ana Folguera de la C√°mara observed: \\"Technique, in this case, is clearly displaced so as not to be recognizable...This artist seems to move between expressionistic vehemence and the self-containment of abstraction.\\" In 2013, at Miguel Abreu Gallery, Raissnia presented Series in Fugue, an exhibition with panels of oil and gesso, works on paper and films. The show marked a closer nexus being forged among her films, drawings, and paintings: each painting was a contrapuntal composition influenced by two visual quotations from the artist's film, which was transferred onto gessoed wood and guided the building up of oil paint, its sanding and reapplication. Likewise, her films were constructed from fragments of earlier work. At the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015, Raissnia showed Longing (2014), a three-part 16mm black-and-white and color film developed from a series of visits to East Harlem, New York. For the work, Raissnia hid her camera in her pocket, using her whole body to aim the lens instead. Consequently, the whirling movements create abstractions throughout the footage. In addition to positive-negative reversals, known as solarization, the work is accompanied by a soundtrack by Panagiotis Mavridis, who composed it using rolls of celluloid film mounted on gear motors. In 2017, Raissnia held her first solo museum exhibition, Alluvius, at the Drawing Center. The show displayed two series of densely- composed charcoal drawings, Alluvius (2016) and Canto (2017), specially made for the occasion. The drawings referenced images sourced from the artist's personal archives of both original and found photographs and films. The images ranged from photographic slides of mosques, iPhone films taken on walks, to photographs of friends, family, and strangers. They were then abstracted through a process of rephotographing, drawing, and transferring between paper and celluloid. The show was featured in Artforum as a critics' pick, with Zack Hatfield penning: \\"While a different artist might have used this backstory to evoke annihilative neglect concerning personal and national memory, Raissnia, through her process, suggests a more generative decay.\\" In a continuation from Alluvius, Raissnia presented Galvanization at Miguel Abreu Gallery in 2019. With Sultanate Architecture, a set of 35mm slides discarded by Brooklyn College, as the source material, the show interrogated \\"the camera's capacity to faithfully record subjects or to represent historical memory\\". The exhibition included a series of paintings and drawings alongside Alluvius, Aviary #3 (2018), Galvaniscope 1 (2018) and Galvaniscope 2 (Film A and Film B) (2018). In the Galvaniscope series, departing from her manipulation of analog projectors in real time, Raissnia set the projector to run automatically in a three-minute loop. Consisting of two projectors, Galvaniscope 2 (Film A and Film B) placed them on opposite ends of the gallery with a rectangular box in the middle. Each projector cast a series of images onto the box, and as its surface was transparent, the two projections blended and produced a distinctive combination of the two films. Galvaniscope 1 used the same two series of images, but combined them beforehand and showed them from a single projector. The Brooklyn Rail remarked that the show \\"animates the viewer's relationship with Raissnia's found photographs, and evokes the embodied perceptual experience of moving through an architectural environment\\".  Exhibitions (Selections)  Solo exhibitions of Raissnia's works have been held at Miguel Abreu Gallery (New York, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2019); Galeria Marta Cervera (Madrid, 2010, 2014, 2018); The Drawing Center (2017); Ab/Anbar Gallery (Tehran, 2015); Galerie Xippas (Paris, 2006 and 2009); Thomas Erben Gallery (New York, 2005 and 2004); Isfahan Museum of Contemporary Art (Isfahan, 2004); Court House Gallery at Anthology Film Archives (New York, 2002 and 2003); and Pratt Institute (Brooklyn, 2002).

Since 1989 they have responded to Eugene's mental health 911 calls. In most cities, police respond to such calls. According to the Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, VA, at least 25% of people killed in police encounters have serious mental illness. Other cities in the US and other countries have investigated or implemented the concept. In 2015 Stockholm a similar concept was implemented and considered a success. In the US as of 2019 CAHOOTS was working with Olympia, Denver, Oakland, New York City, Indianapolis, Portland, Austin, and Chicago to help implement similar programs.  Program  Calls to 911 that are related to addiction, disorientation, mental health crises, and homelessness but which don't pose a danger to others are routed to CAHOOTS. Teams of two responders include a medic and a mental health crisis counselor. Responders attend to immediate health issues, de-escalate, and help formulate a plan, which may include finding a bed in a homeless shelter or transporting to a mental health facility. Some calls require both CAHOOTS and law enforcement to be called out initially, and sometimes CAHOOTS calls in law enforcement or law enforcement calls in CAHOOTS, for instance in the case of a homeless person who is in danger of being ticketed. In 2018 they responded to 20% of calls in Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, up from 17% in 2017. In 2018, the program cost $800,000, as compared to $58 million for the police.

His coach was Italian Gabriele Rosa, who also trained Kenyan marathon runners Paul Tergat and Moses Tanui. In 2002, Kipkoech won the Enschede Marathon, and came second at the Los Angeles Marathon. He secured his place at the 2002 Berlin Marathon a week before the race, after running at altitude in Kenya. Kipkoech won the race in a final sprint with fellow Kenyans Simon Biwott and Vincent Kipsos. The top five finishers in the race were all Kenyan, and Kipkoech was an unexpected winner of the race. Kipkoech's finishing time was 2:06:47, which beat his previous personal best by over 4 minutes.

He has been described as having the \\"ability to do things with his voice no one else in this business can\\" by Jewish music producer Yitzy Waldner.  Biography  Mordechai Shapiro was born in 1990 in Monsey, New York. His father was a chazzan and his mother had a background as a trained opera singer. Growing up in a Modern Orthodox household, he attended Ashar Adolph Schreiber Hebrew Academy for elementary school, and the Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy for high school. Following his graduation from high school, Shapiro learned in yeshiva in Yeshiva Netiv Aryeh and Yeshivas Bais Yisroel. In 2010, Shapiro married Raquel Guenoun.  Career  Shapiro made his musical debut in 1997 as the star soloist of the Miami Boys Choir. As a child, he performed with Jewish entertainers such as Yaakov Shwekey even before he gained significant attention. He left Miami Boys Choir in 2003 when his voice became too deep to fit into a children's choir. After leaving the choir, Shapiro took a break from music until his voice transitioned sufficiently. He was a student of voice teacher William Riley, who also taught Celine Dion and Josh Groban. Eventually, he began performing at weddings and other Jewish events as an independent artist. Shapiro's solo career debuted in 2016 when he was signed by producer Yitzy Waldner, with the release of his album Kol Haderech, peaking at #15 on the Billboard World Music chart. The album was followed by Machar in 2017, peaking at #3, and Hakol Mishamayim in 2019, peaking at #7. Shapiro has cited Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Michael Bubl√© as his musical influences.
