Early life Taylor was born Pearl Frances Finkelstein in New York City on July 10, 1909. Her parents were Louis and Ida (Rich) Finkelstein. Her father, born in Romania, operated a drugstore. Her mother, born in Russia, was the daughter of a rabbi. The family name was later shortened to Fink. Taylor studied at the New Jersey College for Women at Rutgers University and graduated from the Columbia University School of Journalism with a bachelor's degree in literature in 1930. Career After graduating from Columbia, Taylor worked as a writer and reporter for the tabloid New York Evening Graphic. A Columbia classmate, reminiscing more than 50 years later, said that \\"Frankie Fink ... wrote lurid stories about the sex intrigues of the famous and the infamous of those roisterous times.\\" She may have written other kinds of stories for the Graphic as well; one article, in January 1932, for the paper's magazine was about defense attorney Samuel Liebowitz who a year later became defense attorney for the Scottsboro Boys. Taylor was a contributor to The Literary Digest in the 1930s. From 1934 to 1936 she was a reporter at The Washington Post, mostly covering motion pictures. In the early to mid-1960s Taylor wrote a music column for the Long Island Press. She interviewed Bob Dylan in the Manhattan office of his manager, Albert Grossman, in August 1965. Her column based on that interview was published in the Press on October 17, 1965 and has been frequently quoted, largely due to Dylan's disavowal in the interview of his early folk and protest songs. In 1965, inspired by her interviews with young singer- songwriters, Taylor began writing lyrics herself. Three of her songs were published in Broadside: The National Topical Song Magazine in 1966. The first of these, \\"Computer Love-Song\\" (with music by Irma Jurist) was a whimsical parody of computer matching services. In October 1966 Broadside published \\"Those Three Are on My Mind\\" with words by Taylor and music by Pete Seeger. The song begins \\"I think of Andy in the cold wet clay. Those three are on my mind. With his friends down beside him on that brutal day. Those three are on my mind.\\" The refrain says \\"But I breathe yet and for some the sky is bright. I cannot give up hoping for a morning light. And so I ask the killers: 'Do you sleep at night?' Those three are on my mind.\\" Broadside reported that Taylor first wrote the lyrics as a poem in 1965 and Seeger later set it to music. Seeger told Sing Out! magazine in 1995 that \\"Frances Taylor sent these words to me; all I did was put a tune to them.\\" Pete Seeger performed the song on The David Susskind Show on October 2, 1966. He recorded it on his 1967 album Waist Deep in the Big Muddy and Other Love Songs. That same year Harry Belafonte recorded the song on his album Belafonte on Campus. Belafonte has continued to sing the song over the years. He sang it at the memorial service for Carolyn Goodman, Andrew Goodman's mother, in 2007 and at the Many Rivers to Cross festival in Atlanta in October 2016. The song was also recorded by Kim and Reggie Harris and Magpie and was included on the albums Spoken in Love (1995) and on Where Have All the Flowers Gone? The Songs of Pete Seeger (1998). The November 1966 issue of Broadside included another song with words by Taylor and music by Seeger. Titled \\"Men of Principle,\\" it mocked government officials who talked about open and low-cost housing, integrated schools, jobs, and peace but did nothing about them. By 1968, Taylor was writing film reviews, which she continued to do until the demise of the Long Island Press in 1977. She was a member of the New York Film Critics Circle. Her reviews were widely syndicated by the Newhouse News Service. Personal life and death In 1933 Taylor married Michael Zala, a Czech-born motion picture theater operator. They were later divorced. In 1947, she married Joseph S. Taylor, another motion picture operator. Taylor died in Poughkeepsie, New York on December 8, 1979 at the age of 70.

In the south of Yunnan province the festival occurs during the first month of the lunar year and in the north eastern / central province the fifth day of the fifth month during the lunar year.  Festivities  Festivities begin with a toast to the participants, followed by the beating of gongs and drums mixed with firecrackers and gunshots. People sing and dance to reed-pipe music and enjoy themselves throughout the night.  History  A legend states ancestors of the ancient Miao fled after defeat in battle with a foreign land and fell into a deep sadness. One year later their ancestors' apparition advised them not to despair, advising them to go to the mountain and sing and dance. Then a flower fell from the sky and landed on a tree. The Miao sang and danced around the tree, and that year the crops grew well. The Miao attributed the successful growth of their crops to the ritual, and continued to practice it. Since then, every participant puts on their best attire and heads into the mountains to plant a flower. In celebration, they hold events such as bullfighting, lion dances and pole-climbing. The pole-climbing event is especially important to the Miao, and whoever wins is awarded a pig's head and good wine. In 2014, the festival was approved by the state council and listed in the fourth batch of national intangible cultural heritage as a kind of folk custom.

The building is noted as being one of the first purpose built department stores in Europe. As of today it forms part of Liverpool's biggest retail areas centred around Church Street. Rebuilt in 1867 after a fire destroyed the original building two year previously, Compton House was at the time the world's biggest store with 5 floors. After the store's closure in 1871 the building was converted into a hotel and renamed Compton Hotel. At its height the hotel was described as the finest and most central hotel in the city, catering mainly for American guests. A decline of Liverpool's economy in the early 20th century led to the hotel closing in 1927, Retailer Marks & Spencer subsequently moved into Compton House in 1928 becoming their flagship store in the city. History Today's Compton House stands on the site of a former building by the same name, having been destroyed by a fire in 1865. The original Compton House was owned by American brothers William and James Reddecliffe Jeffrey who set up their company Jeffery & Co in 1832. The premises contained within a clothiers, cabinet makers and Liverpool's largest drapers, with around 180 staff living in the upper floors. On the night of Friday 8 December 1865 at 10am two police officers walking their beat discovered smoke coming from the basement of the nearby Compton House cellar of Basnett Street. Local residents and staff in the building were quickly evacuated as a team of firefighters with a newly purchased steam-powered fire engine began to tackle the fire. News spread quickly about the fire with engines being called in from the West of England Fire Brigade as well as 40 men from the nearby HMS Donegal offering assistance. The building's floors gave way around midnight with blacken walls all that remained. left Although originally thought to have been an accident an investigation and later hearing at Liverpool assizes found that the fire was purposely started by 20 year old Thomas Henry Sweeting, an apprentice to Messrs Jeffery after accusation of stealing 6 months previously. A confession by Sweeting detailed how he had started the fire by throwing a lit match amongst goods in the building's cellar. In the aftermath of the fire the business was assessed for damages with a loss of ¬£200,000 for stock plus ¬£100,000 for the building. A further 1,200 jobs were also lost. Owing to much of the company's stock being insured James Reddecliffe Jeffery went ahead and bought Woolton Hall and made plans for Compton House to be rebuilt. A design for the new building was completed within just two weeks by architecture firm Thomas Haigh and Company. Construction of the building was fast and the business re-opened just 18 months later in 1867. After some time William Jeffery developed Apoplexy leaving his brother to run the store alone. Eventually the cost of running the store outran the income and in March 1871 the store closed. Compton House - Plaque In 1873 two years after being abandoned Compton House reopened as Compton Hotel under the management of William Russell. Although a hotel, the ground floor featured a number of different shops including a hatters, a hosiery and a drapers. The hotel itself consisted of 250 rooms with numerous more including a saloon, coffee room, billiard room, reading room, writing room, smoking room, dining room as well as adjoining ladies and gentlemen's drawing rooms. A main focus of the hotel was in accommodating for American guests arriving via Trans-Atlantic steamers at Liverpool's landing stage. This appeal to Americans is reflected by the inclusion of symbolic eagles within the building's architecture. In 1927 as Liverpool's economy began to decline the hotel closed and was replaced two years later by retailer Marks & Spencers' who til this day continue to occupy the building.

The family lived in Paris but originated in the Lorraine province in the north-east of France. The father of Henri was a tradesman. L√©vy was a pupil of F√©lix Barrias (1822-1907) and of Antoine Vollon (1833-1900). Henri L√©vy changed his name to Henri ¬´ Michel-L√©vy ¬ª by adding his father's first name to its surname.

He was a portraitist and often painted subjects going about their usual business,see for instance La Nourrice, Beaux-Arts Museum, Orl√©ans, France as often found as a common thread in Impressionist painting. L√©vy is known for Painting of Eug√®ne Boudin (1880) as the famous painter is himself sketching cows in the fields near Honfleur.Mima-lehavre.fr His subjects are not professionals but rather found in his social circle, like the wife of his friend, Edgar Degas or his own family. From 1868 to 1886, Henri Michel-L√©vy exhibited at the Salon in Paris, where he was awarded \\"honorable\\" mention in 1880 and a third-class medal in 1881. He won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1889. He participated in the Salon between 1868 and 1914.Oxford Index, Benezit Dictionary of Artists In 1878, he was represented by Edgar Degas in his atelier (see insert picture)\\"Only the Best: Masterpieces of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon\\", K.

Lehmbeck \\"Edouard Manet's portraits of women\\" ProQuest p253-254 (2007) As a landscape painter, Henri Michel-L√©vy focused on the peasant life away from the romantic views of the time. But a large portion of his exterior paintings dealt with the middle- class life of the 19th century. An example of that is a painting at the beach (Le Pouligen, la plage) that can be found at Museum Baron Martin, Gray, France in a style that is reminiscent of Boudin's work.

The railway is part of European TEN-T route E59 from Scandinavia to Vienna, Budapest and Prague. For this reason the classification of the PLK line is also in the \\"first-class\\" category. Opening The first section of the line from Szczecin to Goleniow was built as part of Line 402 to Gryfice was built by Altdamm-Colberger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (ACE), which put the line into use in 1882. Ten years later, the line was extended from Goleni√≥w to Wolin by the Preu√üische Ostbahn, or Prussian Eastern Railway in English. After the nationalisation of the Preu√üische Ostbahn in 1888, the next section was built under the banner of Preu√üische Staatseisenbahnen, before the end of the nineteenth century. In 1899, the line was extended to Miƒôdzyzdroje, and a year later to Swinoujscie. In 1901, the station in Swinoujscie (on the island of Wolin) was connected by a railway ferry crossing to the station Swinem√ºnde Hauptbahnhof (≈öwinouj≈õcie Main Station) on the island of Usedom. Between 1945 and 1948 trains could not operate between Rec≈Çaw and Wolin, because the bridge over the River Dziwna had been destroyed. Because of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, in the Potsdam Agreement the line came under the ownership of the Polish State Railways. Following the War a ferry service was started from ≈öwinouj≈õcie to Ystad in Sweden. In 1950 the railway line was extended a short distance to ≈öwinouj≈õcie Port, to the ferry terminal. Only a few trains travel to the port station, the majority finishing at ≈öwinouj≈õcie station. Electrification In December 1979, electrification of the line from Szczecin to Goleni√≥w was completed and in 1980 the rest of the line was electrified. Route Most of the route (93.5%), is double track. Between the signal boxes \\"SDA\\" (on the Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄìSzczecin railway from / to Stargard ) and \\"SDC\\" (Szczecin‚Äì≈öwinouj≈õcie) is a track, No. 857, which is used by trains between Goleni√≥w and Stargard without having to change direction in Szczecin. Modernisation In 2016 it is planned to modernise the Szczecin DƒÖbie - Kliniska and Rurka - Goleni√≥w sections, which will increase line capacity and increase line speeds to 160 km/h. Usage=Past The German train timetable for the line shows that in 1917 the line was served by five train pairs per day between Szczecin and ≈öwinouj≈õcie. In 1981, 12 train pairs of passenger trains, and 5 pairs of fast trains which operated during the holiday season, operated on the line. Only 1 pair of trains ran to the station ≈öwinouj≈õcie Port. One train pair operated to Kamien Pomorski and five train pairs operated to Gryfic from Goleni√≥w. Current The line is used by the following trains: *Intercity trains between ≈öwinouj≈õcie and Szczecin, continuing to various parts of Poland, including Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw, Katowice and Krakow. *Regional trains between ≈öwinouj≈õcie (Port) and Szczecin, with most of these continuing to Pozna≈Ñ.

The team entered the para mixed coxed four finishing last in their event. The team consisted of rowers Margret Bangajena, Michelle Garnett, Takudzwa Gwariro and Previous Wiri and their cox Jessica Davis. Managed by Davis' mother, Rachel Davies, the team captured the imagination of the press due to the unlikely story of the crew's formation and the hardships they faced on reaching the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. Formation Rachel Davies, a Canadian sports administrator from Cambridge, Ontario, was assigned to Zimbabwe in 1996 by her employers, F√©d√©ration Internationale des Soci√©t√©s d'Aviron (FISA), where her role was to improve the sport of rowing in Africa. The following year she married a Zimbabwean, had a family and settled down in the country. In 2012 Davis successfully coached and registered two Zimbabwean rowers for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Micheen Thornycroft and James Fraser-Mackenzie. When Thornycrofy decided to part company from Davis to train permanently with the South African team, it left Davis with free time to spare, which resulted in a new FISA request. In an attempt to widen the appeal of rowing the International Paralympic Committee assigned four berths for African teams in the rowing program at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. Kenya and South Africa had already taken three of the positions, and FISA now asked Davis to put forward a Zimbabwe team for the last slot. Davis had no experience in adaptive rowing, and Zimbabwe had no program either. With only two months before the Paralympic qualifying camp in Italy, Davis sent out a call on social media for people with disabilities who would be interested in rowing at the Paralympics. Eighteen people responded to her call, meeting at St. George's College, Harare where Davis taught. None had any rowing experience and most could not swim. The candidates had little understanding of competitive rowing, and one sixty year-old applicant arrived in her Sunday best, wearing a shower cap to protect her hair. Overwhelmed by the response, as Davis was expecting only a handful of responders, she decided to assemble a team rather than enter single scull events. Initially Davis was concerned about understanding how adaptive rowers were classified, but fortunately two physiotherapists turned up at the first meet hoping to help out the athletes for \\"Olympic trials\\", who were able to assess the volunteers. The initial meet gave Davis three members of her mixed cox team, but she needed a second male member. Noticing that Takudzwa Gwariro, a fellow PE teacher at the school, walked with a limp, she inquired if he would like to join the team. He accepted, giving the team just three weeks to train together before the trials in Italy. The team's preparations for Italy were far from perfect, training on a dam which was home to crocodiles with having to use antiquated boats. Further problems came after a public transit boycott meant the rowers couldn't travel to the dam. Competition The team that travelled to Italy consisted of Takudzwa Gwariro, Margret Bangajena, Previous Wiri, Chipo Zhento and Davis' daughter Jessica as their able-bodied cox. Their chances were almost dashed at the first hurdle after Zhento suffered a seizure. The team was asked to pull- out, but a Cameroon doctor, who knew the shame that would be brought onto Zheno's family if she caused the team to fail, cleared Zhento to compete. Although the team finished second to last, ahead of Japan, they qualified for Rio after being offered a bipartite invitation. After the team returned home Zhento suffered another seizure, and Davis was forced to find a replacement. With only a week before a World Cup race in Poland, an event the team had to compete in to show international competition experience, Michelle Garnett, was drafted in. At the Rio Games, Zimbabwe finished sixth from a field of six in the heats, with a time of 4:08.63. In the Final B, they again finished in last place, but Davis stated that she was satisfied with the team's performance considering the limited time they team had to train together. Team=Margret Bangajena Margret Bangajena (born 14 May 1977) answered the initial call for rowers, and rows in the bow seat. Bangajena had some experience in parasport having raced in wheelchair marathon events.

The traditional population is engaged in sustainable use of natural forest resources. It has been subject to illegal invasions by loggers and farmers. In 2014 an attempt was made to revoke the reserve. Location The Jaci Paran√° Extractive Reserve is divided between the municipalities of Buritis (21.29%) Nova Mamor√© (12.98%) and Porto Velho (65.73%) in the state of Rond√¥nia. It has an area of . The Jaci Paran√° River forms its western boundary. Altitudes range from above sea level. The reserve adjoins the Rio Pardo Environmental Protection Area to the east and the Bom Futuro National Forest to the northeast, separated from these two units by the Rio Branco, a tributary of the Jaci Paran√° River. The reserve would be included in the proposed Western Amazon Ecological Corridor, connecting it to neighboring conservation units. Economy The reserve is in an area of rubber concessions, generically called the Jaci Paran√° concessions, that had been used for more than a century. It is federally owned land. The traditional residents mainly collect native fruits sich as cupua√ßu, tucum√£, a√ßa√≠ and bacuri, collect Brazil nuts and extract rubber. Most of the people practice hunting and fishing to some extent, and some agriculture. The Jaci-Paran√° Rubber Tappers Association represents the residents in managing the reserve. The reserve has suffered from invasion by loggers and squatters, and large amounts of timber have been illegally harvested. According to Imazon between 2002 and 2007 the rate of deforestation in the reserve was 3.74%, second only to the Bom Futuro National Forest at 4.34%. By July 2007 , or 20% of the total area, had been deforested. History=Formation and later changes The Jaci Paran√° Extractive Reserve was created by state governor decree 7.335 of 17 January 1996 with an area of about as a territorial space for sustainable use and conservation of renewable natural resources. The reserve is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). Law 692 of 27 December 1996 altered the limits of the reserve, which now covered . The State Department of Environmental Development (SEDAM) was to work with the Rond√¥nia Institute of Land and Colonization (ITERON) to implement and manage the reserve. The deliberative council was created on 19 September 2001. Federal act 105 of 30 June 2004 gave preliminary approval for use of of federal property, part of the Gleba Capit√£o Silvio, for implementation of the reserve. State law 633 changed the limits of the reserve to exclude the area occupied by the Serra dos Tr√™s Irm√£os Ecological Station, Rio Madeira Environmental Protection Area and Rio Vermelho State Forest. It also excluded areas used for the Santo Ant√¥nio Hydroelectric Dam. The revised area of the reserve would be . Attempted revocation By 2014 there were about 200 illegal cattle ranches in the reserve, with over 44,000 cattle. On 16 January 2014 owners of cattle in the reserve were given 40 days notice to remove their cattle. In response, state legislative decree 506 of 11 February 2014 revoked decree 7.335 that had created the reserve. The decree to revoke the reserve, and decrees that also revoked the Rio Madeira Environmental Protection Area, Rio Madeira B State Forest and Rio Vermelho State Forest, were opposed by the traditional populations but supported by loggers, ranchers and farmers. Defending the decree, Deputy Ribamar Ara√∫jo (PT) said that the only development model that worked for Rond√¥nia was for forest to give way to agriculture and livestock. The decree was supported by 15 of the 16 deputies who attended the session. The Amazon Working Group, with more than 600 organizations representing farmers, rubber tappers, Indians, maroons, environmental organizations and human rights groups, published an open letter denouncing the state legislative decree. An injunction of 14 April 2014 by the state prosecutor suspended the decree. The state prosecutor noted that the constitution of Brazil gave government and society the duty to protect an ecologically balanced environment. It seemed that the area was being rapidly degraded, which justified fast and efficient measures. The case was tried by the court of Rond√¥nia, which upheld the decision of the state prosecutor on 2 May 2016. The judgement also upheld revocation of decrees that had revoked the Rio Madeira Environmental Protection Area and the Rio Madeira B and Rio Vermelho state forests.

Development  The semovente 20/70, captured by the Germans During 1942 the Royal Italian Army had ordered the development of a self-propelled anti- aircraft weapon to be used in the North African theatre of operations and provide protection to mechanised columns, which were often the target of the Royal Air Force (RAF), without credible air defence. To save time and materials, the hull of the M15/42 tank was used as the basis for the quadruplo: The original turret was removed and replaced with a polygonal welded open turret, containing quadruple 20 mm-Scotti Isotta Fraschini 20/70 guns, with -5¬∞ to + 90¬∞ elevation; the autocannon had been specially modified so they could use disintegrating link belt ammunition resulting in an increased rate of fire 600 rounds per minute per gun. The only other change involved the removal of the two Breda 38 machine guns in the hull, the openings for which were covered by armour plate; the crew was reduced to three, two in the turret and one in the driver position in the hull. The first prototype was completed by January/February 1943 and was presented for trials at the Centro Studi Motorizzazione dell'esercito: weighing at high, capable of operating up 60% slopes.  Combat History  In March 1943 it entered in service as the M15 / 42 Carro contraereo and was issued to VIII Reggimento Autieri stationed at Cecchignola in Rome, where German forces captured it. Used on active service by the Germans, by April 1945 and it was operating under the V SS-Freiwilligen-Gebirgskorps, who fought the last battle against the Red Army in Germany, in the area of Teupitz. Another source states that two prototypes were delivered: one of these was transported to Tunisia, where it was tested under actual combat conditions, remaining there after the surrender of the 1st Italian Army and the 5th Panzer Army in May 1943.

The history of Dagenham Greyhound Stadium is dominated by one the most infamous moments in greyhound racing history that was given the name 'The Dagenham Coup' or 'Operation Sandpaper'. On 30 June 1964 the 4.05pm race that left bookmakers owing huge sums of money and the news hit the headlines around the world. The plan Betting off course in betting shops became legal in May 1961 following the introduction of the Betting and Gaming Act 1960. In 1964 John Turner, a 37 year old Londoner, approached a bookmaker called Leslie Carey, who controlled twenty betting shops, and the pair hatched a plan that was funded by Carey. They selected a race, in which in Turner's opinion two of the greyhounds had no chance of winning, and then they recruited 170 people in three groups, who would be paid to assist them. The action The first group of helpers were tasked to place bets on the other four greyhounds in the remaining twelve combination bets at off course betting shops. The bets were placed shortly before the race got underway and crucially dividends (in 1964) would be paid out at the tracks odds. The second set of helpers blocked phone lines into the track to stop the off course bookmakers from phoning the track to lay off the bets. The third group of helpers attended the Dagenham track and monopolised the 31 tote windows throughout the stadium. They placed over 11,000 bets on the two outsiders (the greyhounds that Turner believed had no chance), which in turn produced massively better odds for the other four greyhounds and the combinations that had been placed in the betting shops. The result The result went, as Turner had expected, with the two greyhounds that Turner had discounted duly finishing down the field. The winner was a greyhound called Buckwheat, who won easily in 48.78 secs from Handsome Lass. Turner and Carey had to pay the 170 helpers and had lost money on 11,000 tote bets but this was all as planned, because the track dividends showed the combination odds of 9,217-1. Turner had one winning tote ticket worth ¬£987\\"One Dagenham Tote Winner May Be Paid.\\" Times [London, England] 2 July 1964: 8. The Times Digital Archive. 11s 9d but his helpers had placed the same combination bet 300 times in the betting shops so therefore creating 300 tickets at odds of 9,217-1 and netting Turner and Carey ¬£600,000 (equivalent to about ¬£11 million in 2015). Court case Five bookmaking firms, Ladbrokes, Coral, William Hill, Jack Swift and Arthur Stanley sued Dagenham Stadium for failing to operate their tote properly and Turner for procuring odds by unlawful means. They refused to pay out and waited for the result of legal proceedings. The court case dragged on from 1964 until 1966 before the courts and Mr Justice Paull finally settled on a ruling. *Turner was found not guilty of unlawful conspiracy and the coup was described by Judge Paull as brilliantly successful. *The legal costs incurred by Romford Stadium Ltd (owners of Dagenham) would be paid by the off course bookmakers. *Turner‚Äôs one ticket worth ¬£2,000 should be paid by Dagenham Stadium. *The off course bookmakers should return the stake money but should consider token payments to any punters that had bet the combination outside of the area (in other words, unknowing punters that had nothing to do with the incident). Postscript Turner endeavoured to collect the money that he felt he was owed (¬£600,000) because he felt that it was his racing knowledge that had allowed him to discount two greyhounds in the race but all he could do was write to the courts asking them not to renew the bookmakers licences due to welshing (oath-breaking). Within the racing industry it is considered extremely wrong if a party refuses to honour their bet (stake or winnings). The bookmakers did not pay Turner. Romford Stadium Ltd sold their controlling interest in the Dagenham greyhound track for ¬£185,000, and the track was closed in 1965.

First, Korean traditional patterns can be divided into four periods (The Three Kingdoms, Unified Silla, Goryeo, Joseon). Second, patterns can be categorized by shape such as character, nature, letter, geometric, etc. Due to Chinese cultural influences on Korea, both countries share similar legends of origin and meanings of patterns. Buddhism also had a large influence on Korea traditional patterns.  Korea traditional pattern  temple394x394px Association some world through a specific object or long for realistic desire on the basis of similar figures is thinking principle of charm. Traditional pattern can be shown as incantation pattern depended on realistic wish about the ideal life. So, Korea traditional patterns are visual art expressed by symbolic sign or second nature represented by Korea ethnic group's value emotion. Korean traditional patterns were involved awe about nature and long for utopia, fullness of affection, praying for good omen. For example, The bloomed peony pattern of main themes of Korean patterns means wealth and pomegranate or grape patterns in woman's living space means hoping for a son. Also, pattern has a feature like an appointed sign between group who use that. So, although people watch some pattern whose subject don't exist before their eyes, they respond. For example, if people watch pattern of dragon or phoenix, they recall story related to these pattern or symbol like a lucky sign. And if people watch peach pattern, they will meditate meaning of longevity recalling a mythical peach that is said to grow in Heaven(Xi Wangmu legend, ÏÑúÏôïÎ™® Ï†ÑÏÑ§). And if people watch carp pattern, they will meditate success in life recalling a gateway myth. These reactions are based on common awareness having painter who draw that pattern or people who see that. Since The Three Kingdoms Period, Korean traditional patterns generally involved Buddhism tendency. But affect of Confucianism and Taoism were often observed with Buddhism.  History = The Three Kingdoms Period  It was from the three kingdoms period that patterns showed distinctive korean styles. The patterns of this period were influenced by chinese culture and buddhist art. Because the three kingdoms were in the same cultural zone, the artifacts of the three kingdoms similar while showing respective differences. For example, Four Symbols (China)(ÏÇ¨Ïã†ÎèÑ) were the main theme in Goguryeo murals.The symbols are also observed in Silla earthenware. The 'Cheonma(Â§©È¶¨,literally translated to the horse of the sky)' drawings in Silla 'Cheonmachong' royal tomb(Ï≤úÎßàÏ¥ù) was quite similar to Goguryeo's mural paintings in a tumulus.  Unified Silla Period  In the mid 7th century,Silla unified the three kingdoms and created a new national culture. In this period, Buddhism art especially flourished. As trade with the countries bordering Western China, Unified Silla introduced new crafting technologies and styles.One of the examples of these new patterns was the floral medallion motif pattern(ÂØ∂Áõ∏ËèØÁ¥ã,Î≥¥ÏÉÅÌôîÎ¨∏). Floral medallion motif pattern was introduced from Persia to Korea and Japan in 7C.The fictional flower has eight leaves which have a sharpened end. Also interests regarding the matter of the afterlife increased during the period. These interests were reflected through geometric patterns such as comb-pattern, triangle, circle, and floral medallion motif.  Goryeo period  Since Goryeo endorsed buddhism as the state religion, and continued the legacy of the society of the prosperous Unified Silla aristocracy based on rich buddhist traditions, buddhist art flourished.Goryeo patterns tended to be more colorful. Goryeo celadon was painted with patterns such as clouds, lotuses, and cranes. In Goyeo lacquerware inlaid with mother-of-pearl, there was patterns like chrysanthemum, waterfowl. Crane pattern in Goryeo celadon  Joseon dynasty period  Joseon art was not a product of previous traditionally trained skills but was an independent development from previous traditions. Characteristic for the period was the 'gil sang' pattern, which are translated as lucky signs(Í∏∏ÏÉÅÎ¨¥Îä¨, ÂêâÁ••). Examples of gil sang patterns include Lotus pattern, 'man'(Âçç) pattern, the ten traditional Symbols of Longevity(ÂçÅÈï∑Áîü), letter pattern and so on. letter patterns are patterns using chinese characters (i.e. Î∂Ä(ÂØå)¬∑Í∑Ä(Ë≤¥)¬∑Ïàò(Â£Ω)¬∑Î≥µ(Á¶è)¬∑Í∞ï(Â∫∑)¬∑ÏòÅ(ÂØß)¬∑Ìù¨(Âõç)) which has the meaning of wealth, honor, long life, happiness and peace respectively and was used with decorative frames. This White celadon of Joseon Dynasty is painted 'gil sang' letter pattern at the center.  Usage  Korean traditional patterns were used to structure or daily goods or artifact for Buddhism temple to emphasize Buddhism. The main purpose for making patterns is decorative and additionally is used to protect the article. For example, 'Dancheong' is a Korean artifact painted with various patterns in wooden structure. The reason for making Dancheong was to protect the structure from decay by rain or wind. And Dancheong was well showed color peculiar to Korea. There were blue, red, black, yellow, white, black. Also at Court, the order of precedency and position were exposed through a court suit embroidered pattern. The King's suit named 'Gonryongpo(Í≥§Î£°Ìè¨)‚Äò was embroidered gold dragon. A civil official were suit embroidered crane and a military official were suit embroidered tiger. The number of animal showed rank. In living life, patterns used package and odd ends of cloth and embroidered pads attached to both sides of a pillow for decoration and a wooden rice-cake pattern maker. Generally a wooden rice- cake pattern was settled distinct pattern every family. The pattern was not changed and didn't lend other family.  Classification  Pattern can be classified by subject matter or meaning. For example, subject matter can be animals like dragon or phoenix and plants like lotus or bamboo. Or there are letter patterns like ‚ÄòÂçç‚Äô and geometry patterns. According to meaning, there are the ten symbols of longevity (Ïã≠Ïû•ÏÉù) and complex patterns that represent longing for bearing many sons or longing for success.  Character patterns  Character pattern refers to faces or shapes of humans, mountain gods, Buddha, the Four Devas.

Fish represents life's leisure, success in life, prosperity for descendants, and conjugal harmony for couples, but when seen with the reed, it represents longevity.

The ten symbols include: sun, mountain, rock, water, cloud, pine tree, elixir plant, turtle, crane, and deer. Each symbols in the shipjangsaengmun (ÂçÅÈï∑Áîü) stands for longevity, but when used together it strengthens their original meaning. The number ten (ÂçÅ) also represents completeness.

The railway was assigned part of the European TEN-T route E59 from Scandinavia to Vienna, Budapest and Prague in 1991. Opening Construction of the line was led by Breslau‚ÄìSchweidnitz‚ÄìFreiburger Eisenbahngesellschaft (BSF), which was created in 1841. The first section of the line opened on 1 October 1871 and was from Liegnitz (in Polish: Legnica) to Raudten (Rudna) and Glogau (G≈Çog√≥w). This means that the line originally started in Legnica. From the late 1860s the line was extended as follows: * December 1869: from Legnica to Lubina G√≥rniczego, * January 1871: to Rudnej Gwizdanowa, * October 1871: to Czerwie≈Ñska, * May 1874: to Rzepin, * January 1875: to Kostrzyn, * November 1876: to Chojna, * 15 May 1877 to Szczecin. In August 1874 the line between Wroc≈Çaw and Rudna, via Brzeg opened. The final stations to be built were Breslau-Freiburger Bahnhof (Wroc≈Çaw ≈öwiebodzki railway station) and Stettin- Breslauer Bahnhof (Wroc≈Çaw Station) in Szczecin (originally under the name of Stettin-Breslau-Freiburger Bahnhof). In the 1940s the Regalica bridge in Szczecin was destroyed, trains took a detour via Dabie station, where the locomotive had to run around to change direction. In the years 1945 to 2007, several stations on the route have been closed, with a few new stations opened. Station closed in the 1960s or 1970s are Krzyd≈Çowice between Rudna Gwizdan√≥w and Grƒôbocicami, around the same time closing a station near Orzeszk√≥w ko≈Ço Wo≈Çowa. In the mid 1970s, after opening the smelter in Glogow, the station Glogow Huta was opened. In the mid 1980s Czerna Ma≈Ça station was built in the village of Cerna. The end of the communist era brought the closure of the ≈öwiebodzki freight yard in Wroc≈Çaw and Chyrzyno station. In approximately 1991 Bƒôd√≥w station was opened between Czerwie≈Ñski and Rzepin. The last station closed was Szczecin Klucz in 1997. Due to the high popularity of freight traffic, Kostrzyn freight yard has never been a passenger station, despite the construction of the platform. For technical reasons trains were not allowed to handle passengers due to the position of the Overhead Wire masts on the platforms. Electrification In 1979 electrification of the line was started. The dates for electrification are: * 1979: Szczecin G≈Ç√≥wny - Szczecin Port Centralny * 1982: Wroc≈Çaw G≈Ç√≥wny ‚Äì ≈öcinawa * December 1982: ≈öcinawa ‚Äì Wr√≥blin G≈Çogowski * December 1983: Wr√≥blin G≈Çogowski ‚Äì Czerwie≈Ñsk and SPA ‚Äì Nowe Czarnowo (Dolna Odra) * December 1984: Czerwie≈Ñsk - Jerzmanice Lubuskie * May 1985: Czerwie≈Ñsk - Dolna Odra Modernisation On 29 May 2015, PKP PLK signed an agreement with the company Infra Silesia, in consortium with DB Schenker Rail Polska, on the modernisation of the second track between km 78.509 - 98.642 (Rudna - G≈Çog√≥w).

Built in 1903, it is a rare example in Vermont of an early railroad-related water pumping facility. In use until the 1940s, it provided water needed for steam engines at rail facilities elsewhere in Alburgh. It is now owned by the town, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The former Rutland Railroad Pumping Station stands on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, at the western end of Lake Street. It is a modest rectangular brick building, with a gabled roof and stone foundation. The north-facing front is three bays wide, with a doorway in the left bay and rectangular window openings to the right. All of the building openings have been boarded over. The window openings are set in what were once round openings for pipes, as evidenced by infill brickwork. The interior of the building is single open space with a poured concrete floor. Equipment, most dating to the mid-20th century, is located at the southern end. It includes a gasoline motor, electric motor, and water pump. with The Rutland Railroad, in a bid to expand service north of Burlington, capitalized on the financial difficulties of the competing Central Vermont Railroad to acquire rights to the railway crossing between Alburgh and Ogdensburg, New York in 1897. It then built a major railyard in Alburgh, a presence that is largely no longer evident. This pumping station was constructed about 1903 to provided water from the lake to the railyards, for use in the railroad's steam-powered locomotives. It also served as a water supply for parts of the town. During the first half of the 20th century, steam engines were supplanted by more efficient diesel and electric power, and the pumping station was functionally abandoned. The town acquired the building from the railroad in 1954; its modern water supply plant stands nearby.

He is known for his wildlife sculptures as well as his depictions of well-known figures, including Charles Darwin, Ian Fleming, and Alfred Russel Wallace. He has been awarded major public commissions including the design of a new ¬£2 coin for the Royal Mint, the first new statue for London's Natural History Museum in more than eighty years, and a life-sized statue of Charles Darwin for Christ's College, Cambridge. In addition to his sculpting work, he is also an award-winning photographer, specialising in wildlife photography. Biography=Early life and education Smith was born in 1984 in Glasgow, Scotland. He grew up in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates before returning to the UK at the age of eight. He later attended Winchester College, where he discovered his interest in both sculpting and natural history. Whilst still studying at school, aged eighteen, he began sculpting and exhibiting his first bronze sculptures. He went on to study Natural Sciences at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating in 2005 with a degree in Zoology (MA, hons). Career Upon graduating in 2005, he set up a studio in Cambridge and began sculpting full-time, specialising in wildlife and human figure subjects. His first major commission came in 2007, when he sculpted a portrait bust of Carl Linnaeus for the Linnean Society of London, commemorating the 300th anniversary of Linnaeus's birth. Other commissions soon followed, including a portrait bust of the famous author the James Bond novels, Ian Fleming. His first life-sized statue was commissioned for his old Cambridge College in 2009 to commemorate the bicentenary of its most famous alumnus, Charles Darwin. Smith was inspired to study zoology after first reading On the Origin of Species at the age of sixteen, and he was keen to depict Darwin as a young man, in contrast to the more common depiction of him as an elderly, bearded gentleman, as he was in later life. The life-sized statue was unveiled by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (then-Chancellor of the University) and was subsequently shortlisted for the Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture 2009. Unveiling of Anthony Smith's Young Darwin statue at Christ's College, Cambridge. Left to right: Alan Smith (benefactor); Frank Kelly, Master; Anthony Smith; Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Chancellor; Alison Richard, Vice-Chancellor. Smith's knowledge and interest in the life and works of Charles Darwin then led to him working on the television documentary series Beagle: In Darwin's wake by the Dutch broadcaster VPRO. This involved re- sailing Darwin's famous voyage aboard HMS Beagle, using the Dutch tall ship Stad Amsterdam. The voyage began in August 2009 and lasted eight months, with Smith as one of the show's presenters, discussing Darwin as well as the work of HMS Beagle's artist Conrad Martens. In 2012 Smith was awarded a Shackleton Scholarship to visit the Falkland Islands as artist in residence, and in 2013 he was invited by the South Georgia Heritage Trust to spend two months on the island of South Georgia as artist in residence. The photos and sketches that he made during this period went on to form the basis for his next series of sculptures. In 2012 he created the winning design for a new ¬£2 coin for the Royal Mint. The coin was issued to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the first minting of the golden guinea coin. The new coin went into circulation in the United Kingdom in 2013. Alfred Russel Wallace statue by Anthony Smith at the Natural History Museum, London In 2013 he sculpted a seven-foot tall statue of the 19th century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace for the Natural History Museum, London. This was the first new statue to be commissioned for the museum in more than eighty years. It was unveiled by Sir David Attenborough and subsequently shortlisted for the Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture 2014. Bronze Albatross bust by Anthony Smith In addition to his sculpting work, Smith is also an award-winning photographer. His first book was published in August 2015, and is a visual account of life aboard the Dutch tall ship Stad Amsterdam. Artistic style He states that his skills come from his studies of zoology, as well as the works of other artists such as Rembrandt Bugatti, Auguste Rodin, and Fran√ßois Pompon. He travels widely in order to observe animals in their natural environment, making observations, photographs and sketches which form the basis of his bronze sculptures.

The forest has been subject to a massive invasion of loggers, ranchers and farmers. Location The Bom Futuro National Forest is divided between the municipalities of Buritis and Porto Velho, Rond√¥nia. It has an area of . It adjoins the Rio Pardo Environmental Protection Area to the south, the Jaci Paran√° Extractive Reserve to the southwest and the Karitiana Indigenous Territory to the west. The forest would be included in the proposed Western Amazon Ecological Corridor, connecting it to neighboring conservation units. The forest holds the sources of tributaries of the Jamari River via the Candeias River, and of the Jaci Paran√° River via the Rio Branco. The forest was relatively intact in 1995. The original vegetation was mainly open submontane rainforest and dense submontane rainforest, with savanna/rainforest contact, open alluvial rainforest and pioneer alluvial formations. Land invasion From 2000 an invasion began first of loggers, then of squatters and land speculators, supported by local politicians. The urban settlement of Rio Pardo developed inside the forest, with more than ten sawmills and with associations to promote allocation of land to farmers and ranchers. The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) attempted to expel the invaders on at least two occasions, but was unsuccessful in part due to lack of funding from the headquarters of the agency. By 2003 some sawmills had been closed, but Rio Pardo was now a normal settlement with shops, a gas station, hotel, telephones and other public services. According to Imazon by 2007 about of the forest had been cleared, or 32% of the total area, at an annual rate of 4.34% deforestation from 2002 to 2007. In April 2007 IBAMA listed 236 ranchers operating illegally in the forest, with about 18,600 cattle. Legislative history  The Bom Futuro National Forest was created by federal decree 96.188 of 21 June 1988 with an estimated area of . It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). The objective is to support sustainable multiple use of forest resources, and scientific research with emphasis on methods for sustainable exploitation of native forests. On 15 July 2009 a working group was created with the objective of solving the social and environmental problems caused by the illegal occupation of the forest. Ordnance 3109 of 29 September 2009 authorized use of the national public security forces to support IBAMA in curbing deforestation. Law 12249 of 11 June 2010 amended the limits of the forest, reducing its area from to about . The road linking the settlement of Rio Pardo to BR-364 was excluded, as was an area of that had previously overlapped with the Karitiana Indigenous Territory.. Law 2894 created a program to compensate families relocated from the forest. Ordnance 138 of 15 December 2014 created the consultative council for the forest.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history LeClair Avenue is a short dead-end street on the west side of North Street between Union and West Spring Streets, in a residential area northwest of downtown Winooski. The street is lined with a small number of wood-frame and brick single and multi-family residences. Also included in the historic district are several buildings facing North Street, which formed part of the original development of LeClair Street. The buildings were all built between about 1880 and 1905, and are basically vernacular in style, with modest hints of popular architectural styles of the period. Most of the buildings have had some alterations made, from the construction of additions to the replacement of porches and the application of vinyl siding. with Francis LeClair was a successful businessman and real estate developer in Winooski, which was part of Colchester until 1921. The Winooski mills, lining the northern bank of the Winooski River, were a major economic success beginning in the 1860s, drawing French-speaking immigrant workers from neighboring Quebec. LeClair was known in the community for building moderately-priced housing suitable for occupation by the families of mill workers. The LeClair Avenue development was one of the last he began before his death in 1889. He subdivided a large parcel of land about 1880, and sold the smaller parcels off to immigrants or local residents of French-Canadian heritage, who then built on them. Most of the property owners and tenants of the time are described in census records as workers in the area mills.

Ute and Arapaho people subsequently hunted and camped in the area. In 1820, the Long Expedition, led by Stephen H. Long for whom Longs Peak was named, approached the Rockies via the Platte River. Settlers began arriving in the mid-1800s, displacing the Native Americans who mostly left the area voluntarily by 1860, while others were removed to reservations by 1878. Lulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver. The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims. The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road‚Äîa section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park‚Äîwas completed in 1904. The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938. Prominent individuals in the effort to create a national park included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania. The national park was established on January 26, 1915. Early history=Paleo-Indians Restoration of a Columbian Mammoth People have been visiting the area near Rocky Mountain National Park for at least 11,000 years, including the Lindenmeier and Dent Sites where projectile points were found that were used to hunt Mammoth and Bison antiquus. Both Clovis and Folsom projectile points have been found in the park, some near Trail Ridge. This indicates that there were early hunters, or Paleo-Indians, of large and now extinct mammals, like mastodons and bison antiquus, that traveled through the park. Their shelters were animal hide tents, brush huts, or rock shelters. They traveled into the Rocky Mountain National Park area using a trail that is now Trail Ridge Road. The Paleo-Indians began hunting smaller, modern bison and looked for many sources of food in nature when they adopted the lifestyle of the Archaic period about eight thousand years ago. Projectile points have been found at Fall River Pass, on Flattop Mountain, at Forest Canyon Pass, on a slope above Chapin Pass, near Oldman Mountain, and other places in the park. Archeologist Wilfred M. Husted said, \\"Evidence indicates intermittent occupation of the Park rather than continuous occupation. Travel back and forth across the Continental Divide was the primary reason why Indians entered the mountains. Small camps indicate seasonal hunting in the valleys and on the mountains.\\" Within the park there are archeological remains from about 3,850 to 3,400 B.C. of 42 low-walled stone structures or cairns, up to hundreds of feet in length, built for game drive systems. Remains of such structures were found on Mount Ida, Tombstone Ridge, and on Trail Ridge Road. These slight walls served as devices that permitted hunters to direct or herd game animals‚Äîlike bison, sheep, deer, or elk‚Äî toward men waiting with weapons. Up to twenty-five people may have been needed to execute the game drive. Hunters may have killed the animals using darts, atlatl, spear throwers, or spears tipped with stone projectile points. A game drive sites was used in this timeframe in an alpine area south of the park (like Mount Albion complex). Since they were temporary camping sites, it was assumed that people still came to the area to hunt and did not live in the mountainous region during the winter. Bows and arrows were used to hunt animals by 400 to 650 A.D., and pottery pieces have been found in the park that are dated to this period of time. The Paleo-Indians also continued to use game drives to hunt for meat until about 1000 AD. As hunter-gatherers, they also foraged for roots and berries for sustenance. Native Americans Ute man Between 1000 and 1300 AD, Ute people moved into the Rocky Mountain and western slope areas of Colorado, perhaps from the Great Basin of Utah. The Ute, who were hunter-gatherers, traveled along Ute trail. Their belongings were carried by the Utes or were pulled by dogs with travois, until they had horses. The Utes camped in bands or small family groupings and stayed in the park area during the summer months and in Estes Park for the winter. Their diet included bison, elk, bighorn sheep, jackrabbit, antelope, deer, berries and roots. When food was scarce, they ate tree bark. In the early 1800s, the Arapaho pushed the Utes out of Estes Park. In the early 1800s, the northern Arapaho entered into the Rocky Mountain regions of Colorado. At first, they sought lodgepole pines for their tepees from the Kawuneeche Valley. They then spent more time in the Estes Park and surrounding area. The Arapaho also pressed for access to the North Park, Middle Park, and South Park areas, which had been controlled by the Utes. There was a significant battle between the Arapaho and Ute at Grand Lake in which Ute women and children paddled a raft out to the middle of the lake for safety, but were drowned during a sudden storm. An old Arapaho camp was located at Marys Lake. They had names for many of the sites within the park, often based upon an event or residing animals, which was published in Arapaho Names and Trails. The Arapaho left before 1860 when the area was settled by people of European descent. By 1878, the northern Arapaho were forced into a reservation at Wind River Indian Reservation. An example of a modern cairn at Flattop Mountain There were three main trails used by the Ute and Arapaho people to travel between Middle Park and Estes Park. One was called Dog Trail, because the Arapaho had dogs pull travois over the snowy trail, is now called Fall River trail. Child's trail has a spot where children had to get off their horses due to the steep terrain; that trail is now Ute Trail and Trail Ridge Road. Big Trail, which went over Flattop Mountain to the Kawuneeche Valley, was used by fast-traveling warriors. Stone cairns were used by the Arapahos and the Utes to mark the forest trails. There are hundreds of sites with evidence of Native American visits, including Tepee rings found along the Thompson River and other signs of summer camps. Stone and bone tools used for hunting, butchering, processing hides, and cooking have been found in the park. Additionally, Native Americans carried river boulders to the top of Oldman Mountain, the site of their ceremonial vision quests. The Apache, Cheyenne, Sioux, and Shoshone periodically hunted or raided the area. Comanche people may have also hunted in the Rocky Mountains for hundreds of years. 19th-century explorers and settlers Little has been recorded of Europeans who might have seen or visited the Rocky Mountain National Park area before the 19th century. French fur trappers visited in 1700s and gave Native Americans firearms in trades. A couple of French trappers called Longs Peak and Mount Meeker Les Deux Oreilles (\\"two ears\\") in 1799. Don Pedro de Villasur led a group of one hundred men from New Spain up the South Platte River into Nebraska and may have seen the Front Range of Colorado. The Spaniards were attacked by unfriendly Pawnees, who killed 88 of the men, and the Spanish lost interest in traveling so far north again. American fur trappers came to Colorado in the early 19th century, but were seen as trespassers. James Pursley was trapping in the area, and he spotted gold in 1805. Joseph Bijeau‚Äîwho was later a guide for the Long expedition‚Äîlived, hunted and trapped in the Rockies for six years. There were other trappers who worked along the Front Range. A. P. Chouteau and Julius De Munn traded with Native Americans for furs from 1811 to 1817, but were subject to having the furs they had acquired confiscated by Spanish patrols. Besides the threat of running into Spanish military patrols, the men were also subject to hostile Native American tribes. Long Expedition Samuel Seymour, Longs Peak, 1820. Seymour, a member of Long's expedition, made a painting the first known depiction of the peak. Stephen Harriman Long of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was engaged by President James Madison in 1819 to lead an expedition into the western frontier to document the topography, fauna, and flora encountered on the voyage to the headwaters of the Arkansas, Red River, and Platte Rivers. The expeditionary team moved westward from the plains, following the South Fork of the Platte River towards the mountains and on the western horizon saw what Long identified the \\"highest peak\\" on June 30, 1820. By 1825, the name Longs Peak began appearing on maps. Rufus B. Sage Rufus B. Sage traveled to the mountains in September 1843 and is believed to be the first white man to enter Estes Park. For a month, he hunted the abundant wildlife. Sage described the area as a \\"concentration of beautiful lateral valleys, intersected by meandering watercourses, ridged by lofty ledges of precipitous rock, and hemmed in on the west by vast piles of mountains climbing beyond clouds.\\" At the time of his visit, Ute and Arapaho lived in the area. Sage published the earliest known description in Rocky Mountain Life, or Startling Scenes and Perilous Adventures in the Far West During an Expedition of Three Years. He was one of the first people to write about the fur trapper's experiences in the vicinity. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848) and during the gold rush, more people began to travel westward to the Rockies. Joel Estes In October 1859, while on a hunting expedition, Joel Estes and his son Milton discovered land where \\"no signs that white men had ever been there before us.\\" In 1860, Joel Estes moved his family‚Äîwhich had included his wife Patsey, six children, five Black slaves, and a few friends‚Äîinto two cabins that he built at the eastern edge of the park where Fish Creek, Lyons, and Loveland Roads converge. Estes brought his herd of cattle, that were raised in the green pastures of the park. He hunted deer and elk and sold their meat and hides in Denver. The Civil War broke out in 1861. During a trip that year to Missouri, where he was from, he freed his slaves. In 1865, Charles F. Estes, son of Milton and Mary Flemming Estes, was the first white child born in the park. The winters were too harsh for Estes and he left the area in 1866. Griff Evans moved into the area lived in the Estes cabin. Between 1868 and 1873, he added a gable and made improvements to the cabin. In 1926, the town of Estes Park erected a plaque in remembrance of the Estes family at the site of their cabin. William Byers William Byers, editor of the Rocky Mountain News, visited Estes in 1864, and, climbed Mount Meeker when he was unable to find a route to the summit of Longs Peak. His newspaper articles about his visit led to the naming of Estes Valley. Byers, John Wesley Powell, and five other men made the first recorded ascent up Longs Peak in 1868. Joseph Wescott Joseph Wescott moved to Grand Lake in the late 1860s after visiting Hot Sulphur Springs in Middle Park in the hopes of curing his crippling rheumatism. He built a cabin and hunted and fished for food. In the winter of 1867, though, the deep snows made it difficult for him to get the food he needed. He boiled the leather from a chair and supposedly from a pair of shoes for sustenance. He was saved by a hunting party. Westcott was the first permanent resident of the area. Prior to Wescott, Philip Crenshaw built a cabin in 1858 and trapped animals for fur. In 1868, tourists began arriving at Grand Lake. Growth Estes Park became a tourist town beginning in the 1870s. Byers and other adventurous writers came to the area and their published accounts of the area encouraged others to visit for its hunting, fishing, and scenery. Frederick H. Chapin explored the area and published the book, Mountaineering in Colorado: The Peaks about Estes Park in 1889. A peak in the Mummy Range is named for Chapin and his wife named Ypsilon Mountain. People who moved to the area engaged in mining, ranching, and lodging. Some were also involved in the lumber industry. The Griffith Sawmill that operated near Bierstadt Lake and a sawmill was established near Hidden Valley. Mining rush Lulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came to the area in search of gold and silver. Joe Shipler staked two silver claims on Shipler mountain in 1879 and built two cabins along the Colorado River and the Lulu City trail. The town of Lulu at one point had 40 houses and a hotel, but the low-yield ore was unprofitable. The boom had ended by December 1883 when miners deserted their claims. Dutchtown was abandoned by 1884. Lord Dunraven Lord Dunraven (1841-1926) Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, a famous sportsman, visited the area for the first time in 1872 to hunt elk. Two years later, he decided to purchase 8,000 acres along streams, which gave him access to a total of 15,000 acres, for a private game reserve or cattle ranch. He implemented a fraudulent scheme in which drifters made claims for 160 acres each under the Homestead Acts and acquired additional land through pre-emption rights. Dunraven then purchased the property from them for a nominal amount of money. Dunraven's land grab outraged locals. Realizing that the private game reserve in Estes Park was not going to be a viable effort, Dunraven established a game park and hunting lodge in what is now Dunraven Glade, north of Estes Park. He established a cattle ranch in Estes Park called the \\"English Dairy\\", which had Swiss cattle that he brought into the area. In July 1877, Dunraven opened the Estes Park Hotel, with a good view of the mountains. Dunraven visited the area for the last time in the mid-1880s and abandoned much of his vast Estes Park claims. In 1885, he was made Undersecretary for the Colonies, which created increasing responsibilities to Queen Victoria. He also may have lost interest in Estes Park for a number of personal reasons. Dunraven sold most of his lands and interests in the area in 1908 to F.O. Stanley and B.D. Sanborn. Albert Bierstadt Albert Bierstadt, Estes Park and Longs Peak, 1876, Denver Art Museum was commissioned by the Earl of Dunraven Albert Bierstadt, who may have been the first European to visit the summit of Mount Evans, Bierstadt was commissioned in 1876 by the Earl of Dunraven to make an exceptionally large canvas painting of Longs Peak and Estes Park for $15,000, . He traveled throughout the area with Theodore Whyte, the earl's associate, and created sketches and paintings. The two men also looked for a suitable site, with a great view of Longs Peak, to construct an English hotel for the earl. Bierstadt took a particular interest in a lake, now called Bierstadt Lake. Harold Marion Dunning, an early historian, said \\"that Bierstadt's favorite place for mountain sketches and material for some of his famous paintings was on the shore of the lake that now bears his name\\". Bierstadt's painting of the lake is now in the Denver Art Museum's collection. Founding a national park The Denver, Utah and Pacific Railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881; and the Big Thompson Canyon Road was completed in 1904. Automobile stage lines offered transportation to Estes Park from Loveland in 1907 and from Lyons in 1909. Enos A. Mills, circa 1915Dedication of Rocky Mountain National Park in 1916. (l to r): Stephen T. Mather, Robert Sterling Yard, Acting Superintendent Trowbridge, First Park Service Photographer Herford T. Cowling, and Horace M. Albright. The movement to establish a national park in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado succeeded in 1915 because of the combined efforts of multiple groups of people over many years. Prominent individuals in the effort included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania. Each of these men performed essential work for the cause. Enos Mills Enos Mills, then a 14-year-old boy, moved to Estes Park in 1884. He explored the mountains of the area and wrote many books and articles describing the region. A resort owner, naturalist, and promoter of the conservation of nature, Mills pitched the idea of an \\"Estes National Park\\" in 1909, quickly earning the support of his fellow local businessmen in the form of the Estes Park Protective and Improvement Association. He wrote essays predominantly for popular national magazines like The Saturday Evening Post, and these were published in book form during the more than five-year park campaign, promoting Colorado's Rocky Mountain region to the reading public: Wild Life on the Rockies (1909); The Spell of the Rockies (1911); In Beaver World (1913); and Rocky Mountain Wonderland (1915). Mills also toured the country speaking to audiences of the wonder and beauty of the Estes Park area, and gathered the support of influential friends as he went. Arapaho place names The Colorado Geographical Society arranged for two Arapaho elders to return to the park in 1914 and share their names of places before the U.S. Geological Society printed maps of the park. Some of the places in the park that bear Native American names are Nokhu Crags (\\"rocks where the eagles nest\\"), Kawuneechee (\\"coyote\\") Valley, and Mount Neota (\\"mountain sheep's heart\\"). Bill signed The bill passed Congress and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on January 26, 1915. A formal dedication ceremony was held on September 4, 1915 in Horseshoe Park. The park has expanded over the years, with the largest parcel ‚Äî the Never Summer Range ‚Äî added in 1929. Developing a national park The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938. The Civilian Conservation Corps handled several building projects during the Great Depression and remnants of their camps can be found in the park today. Rocky Mountain National Park was a place for downhill skiing. Hidden Valley (Ski Estes Park) operated between 1955 and 1991 along U.S. 34, west of Estes Park. The area had been skied by locals long before it opened as a ski area. Agnes Vaille Not all leave Longs Peak alive and safe. There is a stone gazebo at the Keyhole formation with a plaque memorializing Agnes Vaille, a well-known climber in the 1920s. In January 1925, Vaille fell while descending the North Face. Vaille survived the fall with minor injuries, but was unable to walk. Her climbing partner, professional mountaineering guide Walter Kiener, went for help; but when rescuers arrived, Vaille had died of fatigue and hypothermia. One of the rescuers, Herbert Sortland, froze to death after breaking his hip while trying to rescue her.Nesbit, Paul. Longs Peak. 1990 21st-century environmental events On June 24, 2010, a wildfire burned over of the park in Larimer County near Estes Park. Estes Park Fire Department believed that lightning may have started the fire. In September 2013, both the park and the town of Estes Park were heavily damaged by a significant 500-year rain event. The park was closed to visitors September 12‚Äì19, 2013, and all roads leading to the park entrance from the east were closed for several days to several weeks. At one point, the only way to leave the town of Estes Park was via Trail Ridge Road, the park's scenic byway leading to the town of Grand Lake on the western side of the Continental Divide. The most lasting impacts inside the park were in the Alluvial Fan area, where flood waters, rocks, and debris washed away parking areas, and much of Fall River Road. After repairs, the road reopened on July 2, 2015.

He was a specialist miler who won four of his fifteen races between May 2006 and March 2009. Originally trained in Ireland by Jim Bolger he showed promise without winning in two races as a juvenile in 2006. In the first half of 2007 he won the Leopardstown 2000 Guineas Trial and the Tetrarch Stakes and went on to finish second in both the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He was then bought by Godolphin and won the Joel Stakes before being narrowly beaten in the Hong Kong Mile. In May 2008 he recorded his biggest success when he won the Group One Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury Racecourse. He then suffered a serious leg injury and made only one subsequent appearance before being retired from racing in 2009. He has had limited success as a breeding stallion. Background Creachadoir is a bay horse with a white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by Frank Dunne. He was from the third crop of foals sired by King's Best who won the 2000 Guineas in 2000. His other progeny included Workforce, Proclamation, Eishin Flash (Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho), Sajjhaa (Dubai Duty Free Stakes) and King's Apostle (Prix Maurice de Gheest). Creachadoir's dam Sadima won a maiden race over ten furlongs at Roscommon Racecourse on her racecourse debut but failed to win in four subsequent starts. Her dam, Anima, was a half-sister to Pilsudski. Sadima herself was a successful broodmare, also producing Youmzain who finished second in three consecutive runnings of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a yearling in September 2005 Creachadoir was consigned to the Tattersalls Ireland sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨83.000 by the trainer Jim Bolger. For most of his racing career Creachadoir was trained by Bolger in County Carlow and owned in partnership by Jackie Bolger and Ray Corcoran. Creachad√≥ir is an Irish word meaning predator. Racing career=2006: two-year-old season Creachadoir made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at the Curragh on 28 May. Ridden as in all of his early races by Kevin Manning he started at odds of 4/1 and finished third of the fourteen runners, a length behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained winner Eagle Mountain. Despite his defeat, the colt was then stepped up in class for the Group Two Railway Stakes over the same course and distance on 2 July and finished fourth behind Holy Roman Emperor, Drayton and Excellent Art. 2007: three-year-old seasonSpring & summer= Creachadoir was highly tried by European standards in the spring of 2007, running six times before the end of May. After finishing third in a maiden at the Curragh on 25 March he contested the Group Three 2000 Guineas Trial over the same distance at Leopardstown Racecourse two weeks later. The Aidan O'Brien-trained Admiralofthefleet (winner of the Royal Lodge Stakes) was made favourite with Creachadoir starting a 12/1 outsider in a nine runner. He raced in second before taking the lead entering the straight and accelerated clear of his rivals to win by three and a half lengths despite being eased down by Manning in the closing stages. Two weeks later at the same track he was moved up in distance for the ten furlong Ballysax Stakes and finished fourth of the nine runners behind Mores Wells. On 7 May the colt was dropped back in distance for the Group Three Tetrarch Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh and started the 11/4 favourite against ten opponents. After chasing the leaders he took the lead in the final furlong and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from the British-trained Mr Napper Tandy. On 13 May, six days after his win at the Curragh, Creachadoir was moved up to Group One level as he was sent to France to contest the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting at 6.5/1 in a fourteen-runner field he tracked the leaders before going to the front approaching the last 200 metres. He was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten half a length by the 33/1 outsider Astronomer Royal with Honoured Guest and Excellent Art in third and fourth. Less than two weeks later he started third favourite behind Cockney Rebel and Duke of Marmalade in the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh. After being sixth at half-way he made steady progress in the straight and finished second, beaten a length by Cockney Rebel. In June he was sent to England for the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot but failed to reproduce his best form and finished sixth of the eight runners behind Excellent Art. =Autumn= In the late summer of 2007 Creachadoir was sold privately to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. On his first appearance for his new owners the colt contested the Group Three Joel Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 October and started the 11/4 joint-favourite alongside the filly Tobosa. Ridden by Kerrin McEvoy he took the lead a furlong out and pulled away to win by three lengths from the 66/1 outsider Tell, despite hanging to the right in the closing stages. Two weeks later he was moved up in class and distance for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at the same track and finished fourth of the twelve runners behind the French colt Literato. For his final appearance of the year, Creachadoir was sent to Hong Kong for the Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin Racecourse and started an 18/1 outsider. Ridden as on his previous start by Frankie Dettori he made strong progress in the straight but failed by a short head to overhaul the local champion Good Ba Ba. The other beaten horses included Darjina, Excellent Art and Able One. Godolphin's Racing Manager Simon Crisford said \\"Creachadoir will be a lovely horse for next year and we might return here for the Champions Mile. He ran his race and the wide draw made no difference today. He has run a fantastic race.\\" 2008: four-year-old season In the winter of 2007/ 2008 Creachadoir was trained at Godolphin's base in Dubai. On his seasonal debut he started 5/1 joint second favourite for the Dubai Duty Free Stakes over nine furlongs on turf at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 29 March. He never looked likely to win and finished eighth of the sixteen runners behind the South African outsider Jay Peg. On his return to Europe the colt was one of eleven horses to contest the Group One Lockinge Stakes over the straight mile course at Newbury Racecourse on 17 May. Rideen by Dettori he was made 3/1 favourite ahead of the seven-year-old gelding Cesare (Royal Hunt Cup, Summer Mile Stakes) whilst the other runners were Astronomer Royal, Haradasun, Majestic Roi, Phoenix Tower, Tariq (Lennox Stakes), Rob Roy (Sandown Mile), Al Qasi (Phoenix Sprint Stakes), Arabian Gleam (Park Stakes) and Barshiba (Sandringham Handicap). Creachadoir was amongst the leaders from the start and went to the front a quarter of a mile from the finish. From that point on he was \\"always in control\\" and won by three-quarters of a length and a neck from Phoenix Tower and Tariq. After the race Dettori said \\"His form is rock-solid and he is a force to be reckoned with this year. I had the box seat and managed to get some room at the two. I pressed go and he responded immediately... he was idling a bit in front\\". Creachadoir was being prepared for a run in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot when he broke his right foreleg in training and missed the rest of the season. Simon Crisford explained \\"The injury to his right-front cannon came to light when he cooled down after working very well yesterday. He's already had surgery and we'll make a decision on whether he races on next season in a few weeks' time\\". 2009: five-year-old season As in the previous year, Creachadoir spent the winter in Dubai and began his campaign in the Dubai Duty Free. On this occasion he started a 25/1 outsider and finished fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind Gladiatorus. He picked up another injury in the race and did not run again. Stud record Creachadoir was retired to become a breeding stallion, starting his stud career in 2010. He has sired several minor winners on the flat but no top-class performers. He has had immediate success however as a sire of jumpers, with his son Footpad winning the Grade I Prix Alain du Breil. In 2016 he was standing at the Haras de Lonray in France at a fee of ‚Ç¨2,000. Pedigree *Through his dam, Creachadoir was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generation of his pedigree.

He served as clerk of the North Carolina Supreme Court, having been elected January 18, 1869, and holding that position until his death, a little more than 17 years thereafter. He was appointed to the post of superintendent of the United States Mint at Charlotte, but could not accept the appointment as he did not qualify for it. He served as state senator for North Carolina's First Senatorial District. Biography Bagley was born in Perquimans County, North Carolina, on 5 July 1833, and was a son of Colonel Willis Bagley. In 1852, Bagley was elected register of deeds of his native County, and held that position for several years. In 1855, he removed to Elizabeth City, in the adjacent county of Pasquotank, and there engaged in journalistic work as editor of the Sentinel. He also studied law, and was licensed to practice in 1859. In 1860, he was associated in the editorial management of another paper, the State, with James W. Hinton. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, Bagley entered the Confederate service, and was commissioned First Lieutenant of Company A, Eighth North Carolina Regiment, on May 16, 1861. This regiment being sent to join the forces engaged in the defenses around Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, Bagley was engaged in numerous actions in that vicinity until February 8, 1862, when he was captured by Burnside's expedition against Roanoke Island, where he was stationed. Shortly after the Eighth Regiment reassembled, Bagley was promoted to the rank of captain, October 25, 1862, and assigned to his former company. He probably did not rejoin his company immediately, as about this time he had been elected state senator from the First Senatorial District, composed of the counties of Pasquotank and Perquimans. On April 15, 1864, Bagley was commissioned Major of the Sixty-eighth Regiment. He did not remain with this regiment long, however, but resigned on June 11 in the same year. He again became a member of the State Senate in 1864. In July, 1865, President Andrew Johnson appointed Bagley to the post of superintendent of the United States Mint at Charlotte, but the recipient of this appointment could not qualify as he was unable to take the \\"iron-clad oath\\" alleging that he had borne no part in what was then officially designated \\"the late Rebellion.\\" On December 15, 1865, Jonathan Worth became Governor of North Carolina. Bagley was appointed private secretary by Governor Worth, and served in that capacity for some time. In 1866, he married the Governor's daughter, Miss Adelaide Worth. One of the children born to this marriage was Ensign Worth Bagley, killed in the War with Spain, and in whose honor a statue now stands in the Capitol Square at Raleigh. William Henry Bagley, second son, was engaged in newspaper work. A third son was Commander David Worth Bagley, of the Navy, who saw active service. One of Major Bagley's daughters was Addie Worth Bagley Daniels, herself a patriotic welfare worker. Bagley held highest honors in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He was initiated into this order in 1857 as a member of Achoree Lodge, No. 14, of Elizabeth City. In 1865, he transferred his membership to Seaton Gales Lodge, No. 64, of Raleigh, and became a member of McKee Encampment, No. 15, in the same city. He represented the Grand Lodge of North Carolina in the Grand Lodge of the United States (afterwards known as the Sovereign Grand Lodge) from 1874 until 1886, and was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina from May 1873 until May 1874. Bagley's death occurred at his home in Raleigh on February 21, 1886. Funeral services were held two days later at the First Presbyterian Church in Raleigh. In attendance were the officers of the State Departments, the Justices and officers of the Supreme Court, the Raleigh Bar in a body, numerous representations of Odd Fellows, among others.

During the period of the United Netherlands he was a member of the Second Chamber in the States General (national parliament). He was also, between 1828 and 1830, the last mayor of Bruges before 1830, when the southern part of the country broke away to form the separate state of Belgium.Yv. Vanden Berghe en F. Simon, Philippe Veranneman de Watervliet. Een politiek publicist in de revolutietijd, in Biekorf 1966 Aristocratic provenance Philippe Jean Ignace Veranneman de Watervliet was born in Bruges. The \\"Jonkheer\\" Veranneman came from a leading Zeeland family, known as the \\"Lords of Watervliet\\". The earliest surviving record of the family's nobility dates from 1731, when the titled status of Philippe Veranneman de Watervliet's ancestor was confirmed \\"to the extent necessary\\" (\\"voor zoveel als nodig\\") by the emperor Charles VI. Philippe's father was Jean-Charles Veranneman: his mother, born Em√©rance Colette Pardo de Fremicourt, was a surviving member of a Spanish family that had been powerful in Bruges during the seventeenth century. In 1817 he himself married Hortense de Peellaert (1800-1852). Thirteen years his junior, she was a daughter of Count Anselme de Peellaert. The marriage produced four recorded children and a large number of remoter descendants. Philippe Jean Ignace Veranneman de Watervliet should not be confused with his uncle and near-namesake, Philippe Joseph Jean Veranneman de Watervliet (1761-1815), the politician-philosopher author of \\"Trait√© de la souverainet√©\\". Biography Veranneman reached adulthood during the later years of the United Netherlands as a region within the First French Empire, and seemed destined for a leading political career within it. In March 1814 he became a member of the provisional administration (forerunner of the Provincial Council) in the Department of Lys. The next year, with the Napoleonic empire widely believed to have been consigned to history, he became a member of the States-Provincial (regional parliament) of West Flanders, a post he would retain till 1828. In 1817 he became a member of the local council for Bruges, but he resigned from that position the next year, serving as district commissioner for the nearby Torhout district between 1818 and 1820. In 1820 he was appointed a permanent delegate/member of the Provincial-Executive \\"(Gedeputeerde Staten\\"). Between 1823 and 1828 he served as district commissioner for Bruges. In October 1827 he was nominated as mayor of Bruges in succession to . The appointment became effective early in 1828. That same year the Bruges region nominated him as a member of the Second Chamber in the States General (national parliament), where he represented the West Flanders district between 21 October 1828 and 18 October 1830. During the crucial days in August and September 1830 he was present not in Bruges, but in The Hague, participating in the parliamentary session of the Second Chamber. When he did return, his loyalty to the new state was doubted in some quarters. His mayoral responsibilities in Bruges had been transferred to his deputy, . Although the transfer of powers had been viewed as temporary, Veranneman de Watervliet made no attempt to win them back. He resigned on 22 October 1830 and retired to his manor in Hertsberge, where he later died, aged 56. Evaluation It has been suggested that Veranneman was condemned by the Belgian \\"revolutionaries\\" who identified him as an \\"Orangist\\" (in favour of a return to rule from The Hague). The West Flanders historians and Els Witte cast doubt in this interpretation. In the national Second Chamber Veranneman always remained on the opposition benches. It was on his own initiative, in August 1830, that he petitioned the Dutch king on behalf of the city of Bruges in support of an administrative separation between the northern and the southern Netherlands. Even in July 1830, he was reconfirmed as a member of the chamber by his voters in Bruges, appreciative of his opposition to the old status quo of domination by the north.Albert De Jonghe, Onuitgegeven bescheiden over de gebeurtenissen te Brugge in Augustus en September 1830, in: Handelingen van het Genootschap voor Geschiedenis te Brugge, Jaargang 1934. The failure to re-elect him as mayor in November 1830 was simply a response to a feeling among the voters (well-heeled citizens of whom, at this stage, there were fewer than 500) that it was time for a change. Veranneman's decision to attend parliament in The Hague during the summer of 1830, when there was revolution much closer to home, reflected his belief that he could be more useful to Bruges by representing his city in the Dutch capital, especially given his confidence in the abilities of his deputy, Jean-Baptiste Coppieters 't Wallant to administer the city in his absence.

The Viberti introduced since in 1941 a prototype based on the truck SPA Dovunque 35, however, technical doubts (the excessive weight of the armor on the chassis) and doctrinal questions on the use of such vehicle not turned the project into a contract.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. In the Olympic Games during the years, despite its approach of \\"peace through sport\\", there have been many expressions of antisemitism, most notably in the Munich Massacre of 1972, which ended in the death of eleven Israeli athletes. The first official commemoration in acknowledgment of the massacre happened in 2016. Because Israel is the only Jewish state, most of the manifestations of antisemitism have taken anti-Israel forms. The Olympic Games=Berlin - 1936 Athletics, 5000 m, Berlin 1936 *The 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin, Germany soon after Adolf Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, were subjected to boycotts and racial discrimination. Jews were banned from the German team. Critics claimed that Hitler used the Olympic stage to propagate his own political ideologies. Hitler was also heavily criticized for his racist attitude towards the Jewish participants in the games. Recognizing the exploitation of the Olympic Games for political purposes by Hitler, a number of organizations and leading politicians called for a boycott of the games. Munich - 1972 One of the Munich's terrorists * During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, eleven Israeli Olympic team members were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September who eventually killed them along with a German police officer. Shortly after the crisis began, they demanded 234 prisoners jailed in Israel and the German-held founders of the Red Army Faction (Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof) be released. The attack was motivated by secular nationalism, with the commander of the terrorist group, Luttif Afif, having been born to Jewish and Christian parents. German neo-Nazis gave the attackers logistical assistance. Police officers killed five of the eight Black September members during a failed rescue attempt. They captured the three survivors, whom West Germany later released following hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615 in October. Mossad responded to the release with the 1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon and Operation Wrath of God, tracking down and killing Palestinians suspected of involvement in the massacre. On 3 August 2016, two days prior to the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee officially honored the eleven Israelis killed for the first time. Moscow - 1980 * Israel was one of the countries that boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but also because of Soviet anti-semitic and anti- Israel policies.TIMELINE: Jews in the Summer Olympics Atlanta - 1996 * The French synchronized swimming team agreed to change their Holocaust themed performance for the Atlanta Olympic Games after protests from French Jews. Athens - 2004 * Iranian judoka Arash Miresmaeili was to fight the Israeli Ehud Vaks but was disqualified for being over the weight limit. In order to avoid implicit recognition of Israel, Iran forbids its athletes from competing against Israeli athletes. An Iranian National Olympic Committee spokesman said it was Iran's \\"general policy\\" not to face Israeli athletes. He earned public praise from the Iranian government. Beijing - 2008 * Iranian swimmer Mohammad Alirezaei refused to race in the same heat as Israeli Tom Beeri, who finished 4th, leaving his lane empty during the heat. At the 2009 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Alirezaei refused to race in the same heat as Israeli competitor Mickey Malul. London - 2012 Remembering the Munich massacre, London 2012 (1) * At a ceremony for memory of the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches that were killed at the 1972 Summer Olympics, top Olympics' official Jacques Rogge came under attack over the refusal to honor the dead with a minute‚Äôs silence at the opening ceremony of London 2012. Instead, a week before the official opening of the Games, Rogge held a minute of silence during a minor ceremony in the Olympic village. Rio de Janeiro - 2016 * Media outlets published a story about Palestinian swimmer Mary Al-Atrash, claiming she was unable to use an Olympic- sized pool for training. ‚ÄúThere is no Olympic-sized swimming pool in the Palestinian territories that Palestinians are allowed to use, so Atrash practices at the YMCA in Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem\\", Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. ‚ÄúThe pool is 25 meters long, half the length of the facility she‚Äôll compete in at Rio\\". Israeli officials said she refused to apply for a permit to travel to Jerusalem to use their facilities. Liel Leibovitz of Tablet Magazine pointed out that there are several full-sized pools within the Palestinian territories she could have used. * Lebanese Olympians refused to ride on a bus with Israeli athletes to get to the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics. When the Israeli delegation of athletes and coaches tried to board the bus to Maracana stadium, the head of the Lebanese delegation blocked the entrance. * A Saudi female judo competitor forfeited her first round match at the Olympic Games to avoid going up against a rival from Israel, it has been claimed. Joud Fahmy was supposed to have taken on Christianne Legentil from Mauritius for the right to take on Israel‚Äôs Gili Cohen in the next round. But before the clash, Saudi officials tweeted that she had injured her arm and leg during training and that medics had told her to pull out. Afterwards, media outlets in Israel reportedly suggested that 22-year-old Fahmy was not injured. According to the Times of Israel, Channel 2 broadcaster said she had dropped out to avoid a fixture against an Israeli. * After losing a judo match, Islam El Shehaby, a fighter from Egypt, refused to shake his Israeli opponent‚Äôs hand ‚Äî a major breach of judo etiquette. After beating him, Israeli fighter Ori Sasson extended his hand to El Shehaby. In response, the Egyptian fighter backed away, refusing to reciprocate the gesture. * In an Olympic qualifying match, Ala Ghasoun, a boxer from Syria, refused to fight an Israeli athlete. Ghasoun said competing with an athlete from Israel ‚Äúwould mean that I, as an athlete, and Syria, as a state, recognize the state of Israel\\". * Facebook placed Israel last on its list of competing countries without its flag. A Facebook feature, called Profile Frames, allowed users to add a flag and the Rio 2016 in their profile photo. The Israel option was placed at the bottom of the countries list after Zimbabwe, which was the last country alphabetically on the list. Also absent was the Israeli flag in the option. Instead, the flag of the Israeli Olympic Committee was available.

Background A Nord Noratlas aircraft of the Hellenic Air Force photographed in 1979. Since the 1950s, Greece had established a foreign policy favoring the union of Cyprus with Greece. In 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was established with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots being its two founding communities. Archbishop Makarios was elected as its first President. Makarios came to believe that unification of the island with Greece was not possible and pursued a policy of non-alignment. After a military coup in April 1967, a right-wing military junta seized power in Athens. The Greek juntists suspected Makarios for not being truly in favor of unification and prepared five plans to overthrow him between 1971 and 1974.Haralambos Athanasopulos. Greece, Turkey and the Aegean Sea: A Case Study in International Law, McFarland & Co, 2001. . p. 152 Eventually, on 15 July 1974, a military coup d'√©tat orchestrated by the Cypriot National Guard and the junta of Athens succeeded in deposing Makarios and replacing him with nationalist Nikos Sampson. On the pretext of a peacekeeping operation, Turkey took military action code-named Operation Atilla and invaded Cyprus on 20 July 1974.Andreas Constandinos. America, Britain and the Cyprus Crisis of 1974: Calculated Conspiracy or Foreign Policy Failure?, AuthorHouse, 2009. Preparations and departure The Greek leadership in Athens was largely taken by surprise. The political situation deteriorated rapidly due to the Turkish invasion and the junta was soon at the verge of total collapse. Despite an initial order for implementation, the existing military plans for the reinforcement of the defenses in Cyprus were cancelled. In a climate of confusion and indecision, it was eventually decided to send one commando battalion by air. An initial plan to airlift a battalion based in northern Greece from Thessaloniki airport using requisitioned Boeing 720 aircraft of Olympic Airways was cancelled.Œ£Œ¨Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÇ Œî. ŒíŒªŒ¨œÉœÉŒ∑œÇ.

Later, it was decided to airlift another unit from Souda airport, using almost the entire transport fleet of the Hellenic Air Force at the time. The unit chosen was the Alpha Raider Squadron reinforced with men from the amphibious-capable Gamma Raider Squadron. Thus, in the late afternoon of July 21, a fleet of 20 Noratlas and 10 C-47 aircraft were relocated to Souda airport, base of the 115 Combat Wing. According to orders, the transport aircraft would secretly take off at night with five minutes separation and fly without fighter escort. To avoid detection, they would fly at low altitudes below 200 ft in full radio silence with minimum lights and no visual contact between them. They would land in Nicosia, unload the force and take off immediately for the return to Greece under the cover of darkness. Each aircraft would carry four airmen (two pilots, a flight engineer and a navigator) and approximately 30 commandos with their weapons and ammunition.Œ£. ŒöŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒ≠œÑœÉŒ∑œÇ.

It was estimated that the 750 km flight to Cyprus would last around three hours. As a result, the latest time at which an aircraft could take off, fly to Cyprus, unload and depart before dawn was 24:00. The first plane departed Souda at around 22:35 and the departure plan was followed by the first five aircraft. Afterwards, several delays resulted in only 13 Noratlas aircraft of the 354th Sqdn. \\"Pegasus\\" managing to take off before the midnight time limit. Two more aircraft, the second of which carried the unit's heavy weapons and ammunition but no troops, ignored orders and took off at 00:20 and 00.23. These planes were numbered in the order of their departure, receiving codes Niki-1 to Niki-15. The remaining five Noratlases and all the C-47 did not take off. Arrival in Nicosia The Cypriot National Guard lacked an air force, hence Turkey had full air superiority over the island. Turkish Air Force had bombed Nicosia airport and only one third of the runway was usable. Of the 15 Noratlases that took off, 13 made it to Cyprus and the remaining two landed on Crete and Rhodes due to mechanical problems. Upon arrival at Nicosia International Airport at around 02:00 AM, the aircraft were engaged by Cypriot National Guard anti-aircraft gunners of the 195 MEA/AP battalion, who were uninformed about their arrival and mistook them for a Turkish airborne assault. As a result, the 4th Noratlas (Niki-4) received heavy fire and was shot down two miles short of the runway with the loss of four crew and 27 commandos. Two more commandos were killed and 10 wounded on-board Niki-6, which landed with both engines severely damaged. One more Noratlas aircraft (Niki-3) was badly damaged and could not take off again. Another aircraft (Niki-12) did not have sufficient fuel for the return flight. These aircraft were destroyed on the ground by Greek- Cypriot forces, following orders of the Hellenic Air Force Headquarters. The rationale for doing so was that Greece was not officially at war with Turkey, thus any evidence of Greek involvement in the operations in Cyprus should be erased. The remaining nine aircraft managed to return safely to Greece after unloading their troops. Return of remains The remains of Niki-4 and the bodies of most of the men it carried were hastily buried on a hill, which is now a military cemetery and war memorial known as Makedonitissa Tomb. In summer 2015, excavations started at Makedonitissa with the aim to recover any human remains.Cypriot officials say they may have found Greek aircraft shot down in 1974, The Guardian, 6/8/2015. After 14 months, DNA identification of those on board was completed and the remains of 16 Greek soldiers were handed over to their relatives in early October, 2016, 42 years after their death.Waiting for answers for 42 years, Kathimerini, 18/10/2016. Aftermath Operation Niki has been characterized as suicidal. It was ill-prepared and used unreliable, ageing aircraft that flew very low with nothing but a gyrocompass to guide them. Most aircraft crews and commandos were unfamiliar with the terrain at their destination. Ground forces at Nicosia had not been notified in time about their arrival. The operation had no tactical justification but merely a symbolic and morale-boosting character. The rationale of an airlift instead of an airdrop operation has also been criticized. Nevertheless, the transported Greek commando unit who was given the Greek Cypriot designation 35 Raider Squadron (35 MK), fought gallantly during the second Turkish invasion of August 1974 and contributed decisively to saving Nicosia from falling into Turkish hands. Ironically, the unit had no casualties in the battlefield. With the exception of the order to Lt Cdr E. Handrinos to turn back his vessel (L-172 Lesvos) and disembark the ELDYK troops he had picked up the previous day, Operation Niki marked the only Greek attempt to reinforce the defense of Cyprus during the invasion. No military investigation was ever ordered regarding the circumstances of the tragic loss of Niki-4 and neither anyone was held responsible. The Greek junta collapsed on 23 July 1974, mainly because of the events in Cyprus.

There are two parts, designated \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", originally with about in total. Both were later reduced in size, with parts allocated to other conservation units. The status of the forest has been the subject of extended negotiations between the state and the federal government related to the Jirau hydroelectric plant and the illegal occupation of the Bom Futuro National Forest. It was incorporated in the Mapinguari National Park in 2010, but that has been appealed. Early history The Rio Vermelho \\"A\\" State Forest was created by state decree in 1990 with an area of . The forest was not demarcated and no management plan was created. Part of it was incorporated into the Serra dos Tr√™s Irm√£os Ecological Station. The Rio Vermelho \\"B\\" State Forest was created by state decree in 1990 with . It was to have been a pilot project for forest management under the World Bank's PLANAFLORO program. However, only were demarcated in 1995 to receive World Bank funds. In 1996 some of the remaining area was included in the Mujica Nava Ecological Station. A large part of the state forest was converted into agricultural zones. The Rio Vermelho state forests were on land that is still owned by the federal government, and has never been transferred to the state. Jirau hydroelectric plant negotiations In June 2009 the state of Rond√¥nia and the federal government agreed to break up the Bom Futuro National Forest into three parts: a environmental protection area, a state forest and a federal protected area to be run by the federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). This would recognize the de facto occupation of much of the national park by squatters. The state would also transfer the Rio Vermelho A and B state forest and the Serra dos Tr√™s Irm√£os and Mujica Nava ecological stations to the federal union to create a fully protected federal unit of . The deal was related to the state agreeing to allow the Jirau hydroelectric plant to proceed. State governor decree 14405 of 16 July 2009 established a special commission to study the social and environmental impacts of the uncontrolled occupation of the Bom Futuro National Forest, to monitor the process of releasing land from the national forest, and to study the transfer of the Rio Vermelho forest and the ecological stations to ICMBio. In August 2009 the Federal Public Ministry and the Public Ministry of the State of Rondonia asked the Federal Court set aside the agreement. They argued that the agreement was purely political, and would cause further environmental damage. Federal law 12.249 of 2010 altered the boundaries of forest areas in Rond√¥nia. The Bom Futuro National Forest was reduced in size from , with the excluded areas transferred to the state of Rond√¥nia. In return, the state government would withdraw objections to environmental licensing of the Jirau hydroelectric plant, which would flood of the Rio Vermelho forest. The Rio Vermelho A and B State Forest and the Serra dos Tr√™s Irm√£os and Mujica Nava ecological stations, totalling about would be transferred to ICMBio. The boundaries of the Mapinguari National Park were modified by law 12249 of 11 June 2010 which added about but excluded the area that would be flooded by the Jirau Dam to create the reservoir for the Jirau Hydroelectric Power Plant. In July 2013 the Attorney General again challenged this law on the basis of unconstitutionality. On 16 January 2014 owners of cattle in the Jaci Paran√° Extractive Reserve were given 40 days notice to remove their cattle. In response, state legislative decree 506 of 11 February 2014 revoked the reserve. This decree, and decrees that also revoked the Rio Madeira Environmental Protection Area, Rio Madeira B State Forest and Rio Vermelho State Forest, were opposed by the traditional populations but supported by loggers, ranchers and farmers. An injunction of 14 April 2014 by the state prosecutor suspended the decree. The case was tried by the court of Rond√¥nia, which upheld the decision of the state prosecutor on 2 May 2016. The judgement also upheld revocation of decrees that had revoked the Rio Madeira Environmental Protection Area and the Rio Madeira B and Rio Vermelho state forests.

Released for free on YouTube, the film retells the story of WWE professional wrestler Triple H. Like Landis's 2012 short The Death and Return of Superman, it consists of an unscripted monologue by Landis on the subject matter, accompanied by sequences with actors performing the parts in the story. Plot In response to the common criticism that professional wrestling is \\"fake,\\" Max Landis attempts to defend the sport as a legitimately compelling form of fiction. To make this point, he points out that modern professional wrestling contains multiple overtly unrealistic elements that hinge on willing suspension of disbelief, and notes that the scripted nature of wrestling matches doesn't make their stunt-work and choreography any less spectacular. In an effort to prove that wrestling can be as entertaining as any other form of fiction, Landis recounts the story of his favorite wrestler Paul Levesque, better known by his ring name \\"Triple H.\\" His retelling of Triple H's wrestling career starts with his early days as the wealthy and snobbish \\"Hunter Hearst Helmsley,\\" continues with his friendship with Shawn Michaels and his co-founding of the rebellious and rambunctious \\"D-Generation X,\\" and ultimately recounts his reign as World Heavyweight Champion, his time as the brutal and paranoid leader of \\"Evolution,\\" and his reinvention as a powerful corporate strongman. In recounting the evolution of Triple H's in- ring persona, Landis presents the interpretation that all of the wrestler's various gimmicks are different facets of the same character: an arrogant but deeply insecure man with an inferiority complex, who never got over the pain of being overshadowed by better wrestlers. The retelling ends with Triple H's ascension to Chief Operating Officer of the WWE following his marriage to Stephanie McMahon; Landis suggests that Triple H sought power behind the scenes of the company because he could never achieve the glory that he truly desired in the ring.

It features a cast of close to a hundred extras, with most people involved working for free. Ron Howard was intended to make a cameo appearance, as he did in The Death and Return of Superman, but was unavailable for filming. In a Reddit \\"Ask Me Anything\\" Landis mentioned that his father John Landis was initially hesitant to appear in the short due to an aversion to being involved in his son's work, but ultimately agreed once he saw the finished product. Reception Writing for the Wall Street Journal, Michael Calia said that Landis's characterization of wrestling as \\"packed with the stuff of fiction, both good and terrible\\" was \\"not exactly a new insight\\", but said that Landis \\"defends wrestling in a fun, inventive way\\". Writing for Progressive Boink, Bill Hanstock praised the short for not only serving as a comprehensive history of the Triple H character, but for delving into the \\"subtext, motive and narrative arc for a character that didn't really occur to me in precisely this way before.\\" Users on Letterboxd currently rate the film 3.7 out of 5. Initially, it was reported by Bryan Alvarez that employees of the WWE were told not to publicly comment on the video. Max Landis himself, however, responded to this on Twitter and clarified that this was simply due to the videos non family friendly content. The video was eventually praised by Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, both of whom it depicts as characters. The short earned Landis a position as a creative consultant on WWE Raw.

IFTRAN had these basic structured programming constructs: IF...ELSEIF...ENDIF, DO...ENDDO, FOR...ENDFOR, and CASEOF...CASE...ENDCASE statements that transliterated into pure-FORTRAN. IFTRAN was bootstrapped through multiple stages from a hand- build parser that added IFTRAN language constructs one at a time. Eventually the IFTRAN preprocessor was converted entirely into IFTRAN and a pure-FORTRAN version of IFTRAN pre-processing its own code was used to transfer the tool to other computers. A pretty-printing capability provided automatically indented source program listings as an output of the IFTRAN pre-processor in addition to the pure-FORTRAN code that was sent to the underlying FORTRAN compiler. According to the instruction manual for IFTRAN, a General Research report suggest this rationale for the use of a FORTRAN pre-processor: \\"While the newer structured languages such as PASCAL are enjoying an unusual popularity, particularly in educational institutions, the workhorse language of scientists and engineers is still FORTRAN. FORTRAN can be argued for as the only truly transportable language; when going from site to site, FORTRAN is always expected to be available. Since this is not true of ALGOL, PASCAL, ADA or other structured languages, there is a good motivation for users and authors of code which may be transported to write in FORTRAN.\\" References Miller, E.

History  The ancient village of Cunziria at Vizzini. Cunziria is situated in an open valley adjacent to hills covered with prickly pears. The buildings' structure and architectural details make it an example of the rural agricultural style of 18th-century Sicily. The ruins of the church of Saint 'Egidio, which may date from Roman times, are located in the village. Due to Cunziria's proximity to a spring, tanning was once a successful local industry, using tannins extracted from sumac. The village huts were created from an iron-colored local stone and were strategically positioned on the surrounding hills to increase sun exposure and hasten the drying of animal skins. Skins were cleaned in large tanks dug into rocks, some of which were later dug into the ground. Several have been uncovered in recent excavations. The tanning industry began to decline around the end of the 1920s, although it continued until the 1960s  Legend  Cunziria is the setting for a famous duel, which Giovanni Verga described in his short story Cavalleria Rusticana. According to the legend, the married Lola and her paramour, ex-soldier Turiddu, secretly met in Cunziria under the light of a full moon to consummate their love. Lola's husband, Alfio, a mule-driver had been away working in Francofonte. Lola and Turiddu's affair was shortly discovered and rumors spread around the village, reaching Alfio. Feeling dishonored, Alfio challenged Turiddu to a duel \\"in the prickly-pear grove of Cantina.\\" The combatants walk to Cunziria together, where they exchange blows before Alfio kills Turridu. In Verga's telling, the location of the lovers' assignations is not stated. The affair is betrayed by Santa, Turiddu's jealous ex-lover, whom he wooed to make Lola jealous when Lola first spurned his advances.  Popular culture  The contribution of the marines in the renovation project of Cunziria In 1983, the film adaptation of the Cavalleria Rusticana, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, was filmed in Cunziria. The director displayed the splendor of the place, which was described as \\"a strange mixture of theatrical fiction and reality of rural life, a flow and a reflux of the theater in the truth and of the truth in the theater.\\" In 1996, Gabriele Lavia's film La Lupa was filmed in Cunziria. Cunziria's well-preserved buildings allowed Lavia to show an archaic society in which men and women worked continuously in the fields. His movie had a dark meaning; this city was haunted by ghosts and everybody was possessed, but acted normal. These ghosts possessed more and more people to create an uprising. Soon the whole world would be under the possession of the Cunzirian ghosts. Lorenzo Muscoso began to use Cunziria as the setting for a scenic outdoor theater. Muscoso believes that his theatrical productions can redevelop the village. Muscoso first took a part of the Cavalleria Rusticana and turned it into the opera The Duel, which was performed on April 25, 2014, on the occasion of the Festa Dei Sapori e Saperi, with the participation of nearly 2000 people. The Duel is the first example of an artistic experiment called Motion Theater. It combines cinema and theater through the use of giant screens, a soundtrack, and actor movements in front of the scenery. Additional productions included Marines meet Verga and, two years later, Marines Revisit Verga, a collaboration between his association and the American base at Sigonella, the municipality of Vizzini, and a local forestry company. The productions received reviews in Rai, The Republic and Ansa. In a solemn ceremony organized at Sigonella, Muscoso received a commendation from the General of the Marines. Another show was Romanzo Verghiano, an itinerant journey through the neighborhoods of the village where the audience meets the characters of the famous operas of Verga and finally the Presepe Verghiano, the original staging of the Nativity in the world of Giovanni Verga.

Biography Born in Valencia, Beneyto moved with her family to Madrid at age three, a city where she remained until 1937. After receiving an education in Castilian, in the first years after the Spanish Civil War she encountered an environment where, for the first time, Valencian occupied a prominent position. It was in these years that her dedication to writing solidified, in an especially self-taught manner which was common to a great number of writers of her generation. She also began a relationship with literary groups of Valencia. This education, straddling the two cultures of the Castilian learned in Madrid and her native Valencian, explains Maria Beneyto's literary bilingualism. Maria Beneyto died on 15 March 2011. Work Beneyto's earliest work was in Castilian: Canci√≥n olvidada (1947) and Eva en el tiempo (1952). During the 1950s she published her first two poems in Valencian: Otra voz (1952) and Rayas al aire (1956). In 1958 she produced her first prose work, the Castilian novel La prometida. She did not return to publishing in Valencian until the 1960s, with the novels La gente que vive al mundo (1966) and La mujer fuerte (1967). In 1977 she published the poetry collection Vidrio herido de sangre, and then began a long period of silence. This continued until the 1990s. In 1993 she published her Antolog√≠a po√©tica and the collections Tras sepulta la ternura and Poemas de las cuatro estaciones, as well as three collections in Castilian: Archipi√©lago (unpublished poetry 1975‚Äì1993), Nocturnidad y alevos√≠a y Hojas para alg√∫n d√≠a de noviembre, and an Antolog√≠a po√©tica. In 1994 a new collection appeared: Para desconocer la primavera. 1997 was again a prolific year in terms of publications, with a reissue of La gente que vive al mundo, the anthology Poes√≠a (1952‚Äì1993), and a new collection: Eleg√≠as de la piedra quebradiza. Her last collection was published in 2003: Bressoleig insomnia anger. Throughout her literary career, Beneyto's work had been anthologized in several poetry collections, including Las voces de la medusa (1991), Paisaje emergente. Treinta poetas catalanas del siglo XX (1999), Contempor√°neas. Antolog√≠a de poetas de los Pa√≠ses Catalanes (1999), and Homenaje a la palabra. Veinticinco a√±os de poes√≠a al Pa√≠s Valenciano (1999). This places her as one of the main figures ‚Äì along with Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s, , and Joan Fuster ‚Äì of the Valencian poetic generation of the 1950s.

Practice BiP produces work internationally as a large-scale muralist, street artist, and an occasional animator. Because graffiti artists focus on perfecting lettering styles, spreading their brand and other common characteristics of graffiti, BiP does not consider his spray-painting, stenciling, and wheat-pasting to be traditional graffiti. According to BiP, ‚Äútraditional graffiti writers would be infuriated to hear his work called ‚Äògraffiti‚Äô‚Äù.MacMillan, Thomas. \\"Believe in People Strikes Again\\". New Haven Independent, 24 May. 2012 Likewise, BiP has claimed publicly that his work is not committed to graffiti for graffiti‚Äôs sake but rather, dedicated to a spirit of resistance to skepticism and estrangement, so as to positively change the way people interact with their environment.Chow, Kimberly. \\"Meet Believe in People.\\" Yale Daily News, 22 April. 2011 Inspiration In 2011, BiP allowed Kimberly Chow, a 2009 Yale University alumnus and former Yale Daily News reporter, to interview him and witness him in action painting a piece that visualizes the origins to his creative work. According to Chow, the name, \\"BiP\\", is a manifesto in response to a theme the artist discovered repeated throughout his deceased childhood friend's journals.Chow, Kimberly. \\"Meet Believe in People.\\" Yale Daily News, 22 April. 2011 East Coast Period BiP's spray-paint and stencil murals began popping up overnight around New Haven beginning in Oct. 2010. Early in his career, BiP illegally painted buildings and spaces around Yale University in New Haven.MacMillan, Thomas. \\"Believe in People Strikes Again\\". New Haven Independent, 24 May. 2012 One of his highest-profile paintings in New Haven is a large smiling portrait of Anne Frank located outside of Partner's Cafe, a bar on Crown Street, a nightlife district. During this time, reactions to BiP's work were polarizing. While his illegal work was frequently celebrated by city residents and journalists, city officials condemned his works as acts of vandalism. Abigail Rider, real estate manager for Yale University says: City spokeswoman of New Haven Elizabeth Benton on \\"Encurbagement\\" project of BiP says: Despite these reactions, BiP gained a cult following in Connecticut, with news sources such as NBC Connecticut openly speculating BiP's identity and intentions.  West Coast Period  In what is confirmed from news articles to be 2013 or 2014, BiP relocated to a permanent residence in San Francisco, California. After re-location, BiP discontinued painting illegally (citation needed, not confirmed) and began to paint gigantic murals with permission. In 2015, BiP completed a 7-story mural in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, depicting a man examining his own heart under a microscope. The following year, BiP created a 5-story mural in downtown Oakland, California, of an elderly Oakland resident listening to a heavy metal album. BiP followed this growth with a string of large buildings throughout the Bay Area and by 2018 had become synonymous with the West Coast street art revival. BiP's most well known mural is a 2017 5-story building for the San Francisco Westfield Centre, known as \\"No Ceiling\\", depicting a young African-American resident with artificially large muscles. In 2018 BiP announced plans to continue with up to ten additional buildings in San Francisco.  International/Touring Period  Starting in 2015, BiP began to travel aggressively, painting for international museums and public art festivals while maintaining total anonymity. Beginning with an 8-story mural for the Museum of Krasnoyarsk, Russia, BiP followed with a tour of South America sponsored by Montana Colors Spraypaint as well as a 4-story mural for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Taipei, Taiwan (citation needed). Throughout this time, BiP continued to wear a mask that has become synonymous with his public performances. In an interview with reporter Jonathan Curiel of San Francisco Weekly, BiP reflected on the changes brought on by international success as a young artist.

Damage was estimated between 400,000 and 1 million scudi of the time. The next 14 October there was a strong aftershock. Many inhabitants fled to the countryside, where tents were set up, while others found refuge in the church of San Domenico. Among the buildings destroyed or badly damaged, there were: the princes Orsini's palace (that at the time of the earthquake they were out of town), the Palazzo del Reggimento (Regiment's palace), the church of the Holy Crucifix, and other houses. Rosaries and processions were organized by the people to invoke the end of earthquakes. There were also heavy losses of the cattle (the main source of income at the time), which forced the population to migrate to Rome and Ascoli Piceno. The effects of the earthquake were described in detail in a report published by Carlo Tiberi in 1639, subsequently revised and updated in a second edition of the same year.

It was their 30th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945‚Äì46. They played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. F√©lix Musfeld was club chairman for the sixth consecutive period. Overview Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the eleventh consecutive season. There were a number of changes in the team during the pre-season. Goalkeeper Marcel Kunz would have liked to have stayed for another season, but his contract was not prolonged, so he moved on to Nordstern Basel one tier lower for one season before he retired from active football. Kunz had been with the club for 12 seasons. Between the years 1963 and 1975 he had played a total of 373 games for Basel, exactly 200 of these games were in the domestic league. He had won the championship five times, the Swiss Cup twice and the Swiss League Cup once. Karl Odermatt would have stayed with the club, but the board of directors refused to pay the desired wages, so he moved to Young Boys. Odermatt had been with the club for 13 seasons. In that time he played a total of 534 games for Basel, 296 of these in the domestic league scoring 92 league goals. He had also won the championship five times, the Swiss League Cup once, but the Swiss Cup three times. After four seasons with the club Ottmar Hitzfeld moved on to VfB Stuttgart, for him this was a large step forward in his career. Hitzfeld had played 177 games, of these 92 in the league with 66 league goals. Walter Balmer retired from active football, he had been with Basel seven seasons, had played 306 games, 156 in the league scoring 65 goals. Roland Paolucci was also reaching the end of his career, but he decided to add another season with Nordstern Basel. Between the years 1965 and 1975 Paolucci played a total of 133 games for Basel's first team and 65 of these games were in the Nationalliga A (four goals). During this time Paolucci also played for Basel's reserve team. In the other direction Swiss international Peter Marti signed in from Swiss champions Z√ºrich, Serge Muhmenthaler signed in from Young Boys and Walter Geisser joined from local club Nordstern Basel who played one tier lower. As seen in the previous years Benthaus relied on young players who came up from the reserve team to help, when needed in the first team. Basel played a total of 56 games in their 1975‚Äì76 season. 26 in the domestic league, seven in the Swiss Cup, two in the Swiss League Cup, four in the Cup of the Alps, five in the Cup of the Alps, two in the 1975‚Äì76 European Cup Winners' Cup and 17 were friendly matches. The team scored a total of 129 goals and conceded 96. Basel won six friendly games, drew six and lost five. The Swiss Football Association was reforming the Swiss football league system this year, reducing the number of teams in the Nationalliga A from 14 to 12 and increasing the Nationalliga B teams from 14 to 16. Therefore, three teams were being relegated and only one promoted. These 14 teams were the top 12 teams from the previous 1974‚Äì75 season and the two newly promoted teams Biel-Bienne and La Chaux-de-Fonds. The champions would qualify for the 1975‚Äì76 European Cup. Basel played a good season. But reigning champions Z√ºrich ran away with the title, they won the championship with 44 points, five points clear of second placed Servette and ten points clear of third placed Basel. The second and third placed teams were to have qualified for UEFA Cup, but because Z√ºrich won the double the cup runners-up Servette advanced to the 1976‚Äì77 Cup Winners' Cup and the third and forth placed teams advanced tp the 1975‚Äì76 UEFA Cup. Lugano and the two newly promoted teams, Biel-Bienne amd La Chaux-de-Fonds, suffered relegation. Basel started in the Swiss Cup tournament in the round of 32 on 25 September 1975 away against lower tier Grenchen and won this game 2‚Äì0 to qualify for the round of 16. Here they were drawn away against Young Boys and here the competition came to an end because they were defeated 1‚Äì3. In the Swiss League Cup Basel started in the round of 32 on 9 August away against St. Gallen and won 4‚Äì1. In the round of 16 Basel played away against second tier Young Fellows Z√ºrich and won this easily 8‚Äì1. Lower tier Grenchen were drawn as hosts for the quarter-finals and Basel won this easily as well 6‚Äì2. Basel were drawn as hosts in the semi-final against Young Boys. There was no revenge for the defeat in the Swiss Cup earlier this season because YB won this clash as well, in overtime 3‚Äì5. As Swiss Cup winners in the previous season, Basel were qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup. In the first round of the 1975‚Äì76 European Cup Winners' Cup Basel were drawn against Spanisch Cup 1974‚Äì75 runners-up Atl√©tico Madrid. Atl√©tico had been beaten in the final by Real Madrid 3‚Äì4 after a penalty shoot out, but because Real became Spanish champions they thus entered the 1975‚Äì76 European Cup and Atl√©tico competed in this competition as runners-up. The 1st leg was played in St. Jakob Stadium in front of 33,000 spectators and Basel took an early lead through Roland Sch√∂nenberger in the third minute. But a double strike from Jos√© Eulogio G√°rate and Rub√©n Ayala in the 65th and 68th minute turned the game and Basel were defeated 2‚Äì3. In the return leg in Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium, with over 25,000 spectators, Heraldo Bezerra put Atl√©tico in the lead in the 74th minute, Otto Demarmels leveled the score, but this was not enough to stop Atl√©tico advancing to the next round. In the Cup of the Alps Basel were in a goup with Stade de Reims, Olympique Lyonnais and Lausanne-Sport. Two wins and two draws were enough for Basel to qualify for the final. But here they faced Servette in the Charmilles Stadium and lost 0‚Äì3.

Life Panton was born as Jane Ellen Frith in Regent's Park in 1847. Her father, William Powell Frith was a successful painter and Panton reports that he showed very little interest in his children. After her mother, Isabelle Jane, died in 1880 she found out that her father had a mistress and further children. At this point her father married his former mistress. Panton appeared as a model in the 1859 painting trilogy Past and Present by Augustus Egg which incidentally deals with a spouse being unfaithful. She also appeared in other two paintings; one by her father and the other by Alfred Elmore. Her father's house would host visits by Charles Dickens and John Ruskin.Charlotte Mitchell, \\"Panton , Jane Ellen (1847‚Äì1923)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Accessed 30 October 2016. She married James Albert Panton\\"Obituary: Mrs. J. E. Panton\\", The Times, 1923 at All Saints' Church in Kensington on 10 August 1869. Her husband was a partner in a family brewery business and he was bought out by his brother's widow in 1882. During that period she lived in the Dorset market town of Wareham, which featured in her memoir of 1909, Fresh Leaves And Green Pastures, the domestic print run of which was destroyed in settlement of a libel action brought by local squire Guy Marston, who contested the claim that he had wantonly destroyed records of the Rempstone estate upon his inheritance. The memoir was, however, published in the USA. The couple briefly lived in Bournemouth before settling in Bromley for four years, where Panton befriended the writer Dinah Craik who lived nearby. During this time they awaited payment for the sale of their share in the brewery, and Panton decided to write to raise money, pitching the idea of articles on home furnishing to the Ladies Pictorial magazine. She showed originality in her articles and in the idea of writing about interior design. In addition, Panton earned substantial sums as an interior design consultant. Panton's novels were numerous, but \\"undistinguished\\". They included Having and Holding. A Story of Country Life, which deals with rural politics in a fictional Southern English county, and The Cannibal Crusader: an Allegory for the Times (1908), in which a noble savage exposes the folly of modern society.

Mann Family Mann Axe Factories at Boiling Spring & Paradise (1861 H.F. Walling map). William Mann Jr. first arrived in Bellefonte in 1823, and together with his brother Harvey built an axe factory at Boiling Spring on Spring Creek‚Äôs Logan Branch. For the next 100 years, members of the Mann family would establish and operate axe factories at four main locations in central Pennsylvania: Axemann-Bellefonte in Centre County (Spring Creek); Reedsville-Yeagertown and Lewistown in Mifflin County (Kishacoquillas Creek); and Mill Hall in Clinton County (Fishing Creek). Affiliated operations occurred at Paradise, Unionville, Tyrone, Mackeyville, and Flemington, PA. Throughout this lengthy period, the businesses endured despite personal illness, early deaths, family disputes, financial difficulties, and fire and flood disasters that often struck axe works. Axemann & Bellefonte, PA (1825-1892) ‚Äí Harvey Mann & Son Boiling Spring, PA, postcard view (ca. 1910). William Jr. and Harvey Mann started production of axes in 1825 in Bellefonte. They were only 23 and 21 years of age. Prior to this venture, they were living near Johnstown, New York, where William Sr., their father, made edge tools. Three years later in 1828, they moved to Boiling Spring (now Axemann) and built a modern forge on land purchased from Judge Thomas Burnside. Two dams and mill ponds were constructed to provide water power for trip hammers. Axe production at the time was largely a calling of blacksmiths, and the factory was among the first to employ machinery. Axe production in the 1800s was a laborious process, even with the aid of machines. Early axes were made from two pieces of metal. The poll or head of an axe was formed by folding a bar of heated wrought iron, which also creates an eye. High carbon steel was used for the bit or cutting edge. Two methods existed for attaching a bit to the iron scarf. An early ‚Äúinlay‚Äù method inserted a bit into a V-shaped cleft or ‚Äúlip‚Äù in the scarf, welded in a forge, and then drawn using a trip hammer. The overlay method ‚Äì patented by Harvey Mann in 1862 (no. 35,480) ‚Äì welded steel on the outside of the scarf, which exposed more steel on the cutting edge. Around 1900, all-steel heads came into use. An online video from 1964 captures the effort required to make axes, including steeling the head and hanging (\\"hafting\\") a handle or haft. Initially, output was limited to felling (‚Äúchopping‚Äù) axes and soon grew to over 300 axe heads per day.Fagley, Paul T. (1997, at 8). Man‚Äôs second tool: Mann‚Äôs first tool. The story of the Mann Family and their axe-making dynasty. Canal History and Technology Proceedings, v16, 1-52 (National Canal Museum, Easton, PA). The main building was 350 feet long and 70 feet wide.Magargel, March 3, 1938. Production in 1855 was carried out by a workforce of fifty men. Wages were only $2.50 to $3 per day, but this was greater than the $1 wage received by local iron furnace workers.Fagley, at 11. An axe-finishing shop at Thomas Mill in Bellefonte was established in 1832 through partnership with Franklin Smith, but this venture failed after only a year. Its failure caused a split between the brothers, with Harvey assuming the debts. Later, a finishing plant was added near Paradise (now Fisherman‚Äôs Paradise; lower left on map above). Shed from the Harvey Mann Axe Co., Axemann, PA. The brothers‚Äô partnership did not survive and in 1834 William sold out to Harvey, who carried on as the Harvey Mann Axe Co. Another brother, Stephen, would join Harvey, but illness limited his involvement. Upon Harvey‚Äôs death in 1870, he was succeeded by a son, Harvey Jr., but a railroad accident in 1875 resulted in the son‚Äôs early death at age 37. Factory supervision was transferred to J. Fearon Mann, a nephew and a son of William Jr., through a lease with Jane Burnside Mann, the widow of Harvey Sr.Several reports had the Axemann plant leased by Robert Mann and J. Fearon Mann as its manager; see, e.g., The Pittsburgh Commercial (Apr 21, 1875). This arrangement is not mentioned in Robert Mann‚Äôs autobiography or in the last will and testament of Jane Mann. After her death in 1885, Jane Mann left 16 acres of axe-works land and her house to J. Fearon Mann, and 80 acres at Paradise to Thomas R. Mann. Business slowed in the 1880s as the use of cross-cut saws expanded. Around this time, steam power was added,Magargel, March 4, 1938. and J. Fearon patented (no. D-2961) the ‚ÄúRed Mann‚Äù axe brand.A ‚ÄúRed Mann‚Äù axe is on display at the Clinton County Historical Society. However, in 1890 a ‚Äúmonopoly-trust‚Äù movement swept the country and ‚Äì as described below ‚Äì consolidation included the axe industry. American Axe and Tool Co. purchased the factory and in Oct 1892 after 64 years of operation, it was closed. Today, a few structures remain as reminders of past activities. Axemann Spring still flows and Mann Road crosses the creek opposite the spring. A shed at the crossing was part of the factory. A large stone house, Mann‚Äôs Edgefonte, sits near the spring house. Nearby stands the United Methodist Church, built in 1882 and paid for by Mrs. Mann as tribute to her late husband.Linn, John Blair (1883, at 437). History of Centre and Clinton Counties, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: Everts. Reedsville & Yeagertown, PA (1835-1903, 1901-1923) ‚Äí William Mann Jr. & Sons Axe Works at Mann Narrows (ca. 1885). Mann Narrows (ca. 1885). Mann Axe Factory Workers, Reedsville (ca. 1885). After leaving Axemann, William Jr. first relocated to Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe), and built an axe works. This operation failed due to weather or fire. In 1835 he returned to Mifflin County and built a factory in the narrows of Kishacoquillas Creek (now Mann Narrows), at the base of Jacks Mountain between Reedsville and Yeagertown.Early names for Mann Narrows included Short Narrows, Jack‚Äôs Narrows, Logan‚Äôs Gap, and Brown‚Äôs Narrows. Around 1840 a second shop was acquired in Yeagertown, mainly devoted to finishing of axe heads and making of other edge tools.Mann, at 28. Maps for 1877 and 1886 show a ‚Äúgrind shop‚Äù and mill pond, near today‚Äôs Meadowfield Drive. An 1884 Mann catalog refers to this site as ‚ÄúWillow Grove.‚Äù This was the site of the Hall and Rawle mill, purchased by William Mann on Nov 20, 1847 (Fagley, at 13). Mann‚Äôs Station was located on the river-left bank of Kish Creek. The plant was dismantled around 1970. William Mann Jr.‚Äôs residence sits at the end of Rosemont Ave, above the former works site. A short distance downstream was a second mill pond. Further downstream was Logan Iron and Steel Co. (now Standard Steel). Two of William‚Äôs brothers ‚Äì Harris and Robert ‚Äì were put in charge of the Lower Shop as part of William Mann & Co. Harris would disappear on a business trip to Philadelphia in 1840. With his opportunities limited by William‚Äôs sons, Robert left in 1847 to start his own business at Mill Hall. A flood in Oct 1847 hastened his departure.Mann, at 35. About 1845, Robert had a small shop in Reedsville where he employed two men to make edge tools, which was damaged by a flood. When William Jr. died in 1855, the Reedsville works were left to his sons, James H. and William III. They were only 22 and 18 years old. While on a business trip in 1876, William III would die tragically in a boiler room explosion of a steamboat on the Ohio River. Several of James‚Äô sons ‚Äí Frank, Walter, and Percy ‚Äí would later join the business. William Mann Jr. Axe Works (ca. 1900). The large building with smokestacks in the photo was added after 1877. An 1884 Mann catalog refers to the site as the ‚ÄúHollis Works.‚Äù Factory capacity in 1855 was 500 axes per day.Mann, at 9. Brand names included ‚ÄúWilliam Mann Superior‚Äù and ‚ÄúWilliam Mann‚Äôs Celebrated Axes.‚Äù In March 1868, James added a trademarked label (no. D-2948), ‚ÄúThe Red Warrior,‚Äù which became a prominent name in the industry. Location was indicated by the wording, ‚ÄúManufactured Near Lewistown Penna.‚Äù James also pioneered use of colorful paper labels. By the 1880s, the Reedsville factory was turning out an average of 1,400 axes per day.Ellis, at 640. In November 1880 the plant was damaged extensively by fire. It took three months for production to resume. In 1881, James acquired the Pennsylvania Axe Co., located at Cold Springs Forge near Tyrone in Blair County. This factory could produce about 400 axes per day and employed 40 workers. The Reedsville plant was expanded and steam power was added. Total capacity was now 2,000 axes per day.Fagley, at 16. Around 1889 the plant was damaged again by a flood, and then in 1890 the factories were purchased by the Axe Trust. The Reedsville plant continued to operate and James was made treasurer, while Frank was appointed plant superintendent. The plants at Yeagertown and Tyrone were closed as the Trust attempted to reduce overall industry capacity and increase prices. Production was consolidated at Beaver Falls and Glassport, near Pittsburgh. The Reedsville factory was finally closed in late 1903. Remnants of the works are still visible along the banks of Kish Creek, including portions of a mill race, protective stone walls, and footings of the dam and railroad spur. Above the creek sits the Mann Mansion, built in 1858. Downstream are remains of bridge foundations for a trolley-line that operated between Lewistown and Reedsville from 1900 to 1932. On the second floor of the Mifflin County Courthouse hangs a large painting (dated 1905) of the once active plant. Around 1901, James left the Trust and built a new plant in Yeagertown. Early brand labels used by James H. Mann Co. included the ‚ÄúJuniata Axe‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue Juniata.‚ÄùFagley, at 42. A fire destroyed the plant in 1911, but it was rebuilt using structural steel. After James died in 1904, his sons operated the plant until 1923, when it was sold to Collins. Reports are that Collins continued to produce axes at Yeagertown until 1927 or possibly as late as 1940.Lamond, at 10. Mann Ave exists today as a reminder of the town‚Äôs industrial past and at the end of Rosemont Ave sits the William Mann Jr. Mansion. Mill Hall, PA (1849-1890, 1891-1926) ‚Äí Robert Mann & Sons Operations in Mill Hall area were started around 1840 by Willis Mann, who rented a blacksmith shop near Mackeyville and made axes on a small scale.Mann, at 37. An 1862 map of Clinton County shows the factory location, along with two nearby houses or buildings labeled ‚ÄúR. Mann.‚Äù The Eddie [sic] & Loveland Axe Factory near Clintonville (now Lamar) also is shown on this map. This operation was terminated and Willis joined the Reedsville works as a factory superintendent. After several failures at other locations, Robert relocated to Mackeyville in 1847 to work in a retail store owned by Willis.Fagley, at 17. A number of Mann axes are stamped with the date ‚Äú1847‚Äô or bear a label indicating ‚ÄúEst. 1847.‚Äù Promotional literature and catalogs also indicate that Robert Mann considered this as the starting date for business. The exact significance depends on the company; it indicates both the year that Robert Mann struck out on his own and the year when James H. Mann joined his father, William Jr., in the axe-making business. In early 1849, Robert undertook a project to build an axe factory on Big Fishing Creek at a site owned by Saul McCormick.Mann, at 40. The important clauses of the agreement were its duration for five years, that we were to be equal partners, each putting in two hundred and fifty dollars. S. McCormick was to put up the buildings at an annual rent of one hundred and fifty dollars, fully equipped with machinery for making axes. He was to furnish goods for the supply of the employees at ten per cent, discount. Mr. McCormick was to have the sale of the axes and the management of the finances, and to receive twenty-five dollars per year and expenses for his services. I was to have the entire management of the manufacture, and was allowed three hundred dollars a year for my services. If I remember rightly, with the advantage of some extra work, my living expenses did not exceed my salary for the first five years. The cash capital I actually put in did not exceed sixty dollars, the amount I received for school-teaching; the balance I put in stock after Willis Mann's failure, as he owed me for a consignment of goods I sent him from Mifflin County, and I got this out of the wreck of his fortunes. Robert was now 25 years old.Robert Mann was born on June 13, 1824, meaning that he was 20 years younger than Harvey and 22 years younger than William Jr. Production started with only four employees, and just one remained after the first year.Mann, at 49. When McCormick died in 1857, he was found to be insolvent and had placed a mortgage on the property. The factory was purchased by Robert at the sheriff‚Äôs sale for $6,000, paid for partly by sale of 100 acres of factory-owned land. In 1866, following the death of three children due to diphtheria, Robert decided to retire to farming and sell the Mill Hall works to James, who wanted to leave Reedsville over a family dispute.Mann, at 52. The transaction was never finalized. Robert was often in poor health and next enlisted management help from nephew Robert C., son of Willis. This relationship also was unsuccessful. Mann Edge Tool above Mill Hall (ca. 1910). View of Mann Edge Tool, Mill Hall (ca. 1910). In fall of 1877, the factory was entirely destroyed by fire. Some production was replaced by agreement with a nearby works in Lamar, the Loveland Axe Co.Fagley, at 21. Fire losses were partially covered by insurance and the factory was up and running again in May 1878.Linn, at 573. By 1879, three of Robert‚Äôs sons had joined the business. Growth prompted the next move, construction of a second or Lower Plant devoted to double-bit axes (located in Mill Hall on Water St.). A site in Flemington (on Walnut Dr.) also was acquired, which was part of Ricker & Sons Iron Works.Lamond (at 20) suggests that the Ricker Works was adjacent to the site used for the Lower Plant in Mill Hall (the old Diamond Cement Works), but Fagley (at 21) places it in Lock Haven. Lamond (at 20) states that Ricker did not make axe heads, but did supply iron bars to an axe works located in Beaver Falls, PA (possibly Hubbard). In 1881, Robert decided to retire, with management of the Lower Plant entrusted to son Thomas, while Joseph and Alfred operated the Upper Plant. Both operations shared a common title, Robert Mann & Sons. The Upper Plant had a capacity of about 800 axes per day and employed 100 men; the Lower Plant made 400 axes per day and employed 65 men; and the Flemington works employed about 30 men, making 300 axes per day. In 1884, another son, William H., joined the business. Eventually, Alfred and William H. were given control of the Upper Plant. The Lower Plant was sold to Thomas with the youngest son, Robert Jr., as a partner. Joseph, however, withdrew for a time to try his hand at farming.Mann, at 61. All axes were to carry the brand of Robert Mann, Mill Hall. A flood in June 1889 destroyed portions of both plants, existing inventory, coal and other supplies. Shortly thereafter, the family decided to sell-out to the Axe Trust.Mann, at 68. Alfred and Thomas were made plant superintendents, with Joseph appointed as general superintendent. These arrangements did not survive and in 1892, Joseph was discharged from American Axe and Tool Co. The Axe Trust ‚Äí American Axe and Tool Co. (1890-1921) In the late 1800s, industrial combinations took several forms. Some were loose price-fixing or market division agreements, cartels or pools that often enjoyed only short-term profits due to cheating. Others were more formal trusts or mergers of formerly independent competitors. Franchises were a third form of early trust consolidation. Transformed by improvements in transportation, communication, and finance, numerous corporations discovered that once geographically-isolated markets were now subject to vigorous price competition. A financial panic and worldwide depression in 1893 also resulted in slack output and excess capacity in many industries. The trust movement was the consequence. Estimates are that 3-5,000 independent firms disappeared through mergers between 1895 and 1904, and over 150 industries were transformed into near monopolies, including such vital industries as petroleum, steel, copper, railroads, ship building, farm machinery, telephone, telegraph, beef livestock, salt, and sugar. By standards of the day, the Axe Trust was a fairly modest affair. (It doesn‚Äôt even appear in the famous volume by John Moody, The Truth about the Trusts, 1904.) Formed by consolidation of 14 companies in 1890, American Axe and Tool (AAT) controlled about half of axe production.The Engineering and Mining Journal, v52, at 273, Sep 5, 1891. Later, in 1902, an attempt was made to consolidate the virtually the entire axe industry through formation of the International Axe and Tool Co. See ‚ÄúPossible Axe and Tool Consolidation,‚Äù The Age of Steel (Jul 5, 1902) at 33. Fagley (at 37) and Lamond (at 46) discuss the involvement of Joseph Mann in this short-lived attempt. All three Mann operations signed-on, with sale to AAT of all assets and equipment at Axemann, Reedsville, Tyrone, and Mill Hall. As a cost-reducing measure, these and other acquired plants were quickly closed. However, a number of axe producers were excluded from the Trust, including Kelly Axe (Charleston, WV); Warren Axe (Warren, PA); Dunn Edge Tool (Oakland, ME); Collins Co. (Collinsville, CT); Plumb Co. (Philadelphia, PA); and many others.Fagley, at 24. Possibly the Trust believed these competitors were too small to worry about or could be forced into bankruptcy through cut- throat practices. Reflecting quality issues, some manufacturers‚Äô advertising and labels indicated they were not part of the Trust (e.g., James Mann‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnti-Trust‚Äù label). The history of the Axe Trust has never been fully reported, but government antitrust actions may have restrained it.Fagley, at 26, notes that AAT was declared an illegal trust in 1904, but does not provide a reference. The famous Sherman Act, Section 2 monopoly case from 1904 is Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1904). However, price competition was clearly present in the axe industry; see, e.g., The New Nation (Jun 20, 1891), at 337. Several accounts also indicate AAT was troubled by internal operation and management problems. The end of the Trust came in 1921. All assets of AAT were sold and transferred to Kelly Axe Mfg. Co., whose operations continued to expand.Lamond (2016), web site description of Kelly Axe. Further, members of the Mann family found that subordinate supervisory roles were not to their liking and either resigned or were discharged from AAT. Two of the Manns ‚Äì James and Joseph ‚Äí started new businesses. Mann Edge Tool Co. at Lewistown (1893-2003) & Mill Hall, PA (1904-1926) ‚Äí Joseph R. Mann Mann Edge Tool in Lewistown, postcard view (ca. 1910). After dismissal from AAT, Joseph moved to Lewistown and set-up shop in an old mill on Water St., near where Kish Creek empties into the Juniata River. A local business development group helped finance acquisition of the mill. Officers of Mann Edge Tool Co. included Joseph as president and Robert Jr. as secretary.Fagley, at 27. Production began in Feb 1893. Plant capacity was 1,000 axes per day, with a workforce of over 100 men. In Apr 1893, a fire completely destroyed the new factory. By Sep 1893, the factory was again up-and-running, with a capacity of 1,200 axes per day.Fagley, at 30. Attempts were made to improve the work environment. Around this time, Joseph developed a method for high- quality tempering of axe heads (patent no. 561,409, issued Jun 2, 1896).Lamond, at 36. MET‚Äôs Double X axes carried patent labels such as ‚ÄúThe XX Axe,‚Äù ‚ÄúMann‚Äôs XX Warranted Quality,‚Äù and ‚ÄúXX Guaranteed.‚Äù Joseph in late 1903 purchased the Mill Hall plants from AAT. William H. was made superintendent and Alfred (A.C.) was made general manager.Fagley, at 38. The Upper Plant was renovated and improved, while the Lower Plant was leased for other purposes. The Mill Hall plant was damaged by fire in Sep 1926, and not rebuilt by MET. Today, the Upper Plant site along Fishing Creek is a grassy field with a parking lot for fishermen. Footings of an early dam are visible and Axe Factory Run dumps into the creek at the factory site. One would never suspect that this was the site of a substantial industrial complex, but a historical marker in the parking lot accurately recounts what once existed at Mill Hall. Mann Edge Tool Co. (ca. 1925). MET catalog. Mann Edge Tool, Lewistown, PA. In a series of misfortunate events, Joseph and A.C. were removed by actions of the MET board of directors.Fagley, at 39-41. The directors first tried to remove Joseph in 1909 due apparently to a drinking problem, but this directive was unsuccessful. Another fire at the Lewistown plant occurred on Jan 23, 1910. Two days after the fire, the board voted to remove Joseph as President and terminate A.C.Fagley, at 39; Lamond, at 22. Robert Jr. was appointed as general sales manager, but he would die on a business trip in Sep 1910 at age 44. By 1920, the remaining Manns were no longer with the company that carried their family name.Fagley, at 41. Joseph Mann died at age 70 in East Weymouth, MA on Aug 20, 1929. The last surviving son of Robert Mann, William H., died at age 72 in Lock Haven, PA on Aug 19, 1935. Percy Mann, son of James, died at age 73 in Lewistown, PA on Aug 12, 1949, and was probably the last of the family to have been directly involved in axe-making. Descendants of James Mann donated a number of family artifacts to the Mifflin County Historical Society, which are on display in its museum. Along with various ownership and management changes, MET continued to produce axes in Lewistown until 2003, when the company was sold to Truper, a Mexican concern. The great plant was capable of producing 2,000 edge-tools per day, but equipment was removed and the plant was razed in 2012. Legacy Today, the factory site on Water St. is a senior citizen housing complex ‚Äì Mann Edge Terrace. A replica of MET‚Äôs office signage is placed outside the housing agency offices. After 175 years of entrepreneurial vigor, all Mann factories in central Pennsylvania disappeared from public view: Axemann (1828-1892); Reedsville (1835-1903); Yeagertown (1840-1927); Tyrone (1881-1890); Mill Hall (1849-1926); and Lewistown (1893-2003). Many axes produced by the Mann Family live on as items prized by collectors. > \\"And the wisest are those who make the best tools . . . and on merit alone > for your orders compete\\" (verse in a Mann Edge Tool catalog). Other local and major axe producers in Pennsylvania Many companies produced axes under aliases or for private brand labels (e.g., hardware stores). Others were producers on a small scale as, for example, local blacksmiths. As a result, the number of axe producers listed or found for Pennsylvania exceeds the number of actual producers of interest or importance. Given all of the mergers, brand-name acquisitions, name and location changes, alias companies, and other marketing gimmicks in the industry, it is often difficult to discern where and when an axe or hatchet was actually produced. For example, top-of-the line labels often differed from second- and third- quality, with latter marketed through hardware stores and other independent retailers. Relatively few axes carry a date-imprint. Broad Axe due to Mann Axe of Axemann, PA.

Axe producers in Centre, Clinton, and Mifflin Counties  Collins Co. (1923-1927?), Yeagertown, PA ‚Äì Collins was established in Connecticut in 1826 and later built what is regarded as the first genuine axe factory. In 1923 Collins acquired James H. Mann Axe Co. of Yeagertown. It was closed in 1927 or possibly as late as 1940.Lamond (2016). In 1966, portions of Collins were acquired by Mann Edge Tool Co. Its great plant at Collinsville, CT was closed and equipment was moved to Lewistown. After MET purchased Collins, it used Collins name on many of its products, with the exception of fire axes. Essington and McMullen (1841-1851)/C.K. Essington Jr. & Co. (1851-1880?), Milesburg, PA ‚Äì C. Kephart Essington was initially a hammerer at General Miles‚Äô iron works.Linn, at 370. The axe works employed seven men and could produce 200 axes per week. In 1851, McMullen left the business, and Essington and his sons continued on. James Hayes (ca. 1834-1840?)/ Hayes Axe Works (1841-1846?), Mackeyville & Lamar, PA ‚Äì mentioned in J. Marvin Lee as an employee of Harvey Mann.Lee, J. Marvin (1975, at 22). From Juniata Iron to the Space Age. An industrial history of Centre County, 1793-1975. State College, PA: Privately published. About 1834, James Hayes left this employment and set-up a blacksmith shop at Mackeyville on Big Fishing Creek. This operation was apparently taken over by Willis Mann around 1840 and Hayes moved to nearby Belles Springs (now Lamar). A site on Fishing Creek in Lamar operated as an axe works, run by James and Nelson Hayes from about 1841 to 1846.Kagan, Nov 18, 2007; Lamond (2012, at 47). Also spelled ‚ÄúHays.‚Äù Loveland Axe Co. (1838-1846)/ R. Loveland Axe Works (1846-1893), Milesburg & Lamar, PA ‚Äì Reuben Loveland and Thomas Eddy worked for Harvey Mann from 1832-1838.Linn, at 264. They came from Connecticut. About 1838 they built a shop on Bald Eagle Creek near Milesburg, and then in 1846 moved to Clinton County and purchased the Hayes Axe Works. Production by Loveland reached 180-240 axes per day, with a workforce of 30-40 men. The dam at the factory site was destroyed by flood in 1889 and a fire occurred in 1893. After the fire, the factory may have been sold to a concern affiliated with Joseph Mann ‚Äì International Axe and Tool Co. ‚Äí and its equipment possibly was transferred to Mill Hall.Lamond (2012, at 47). William Mann Sr. (1828-1860), Unionville, PA ‚Äì William Sr. made edge tools and axes in Johnstown, NY area and relocated to Bellefonte in 1828, with his wife and four younger children.Mann, at 7. Around 1832, he moved to a small farm near Unionville and leased a shop in Unionville (possibly on 1861 Walling Map as a ‚Äútin shop‚Äù). It is not known if he made axes in Unionville, but he did pass on these skills to his sons.Mann, at 16. O.A. Norlund Co. (1968-1986?), Lewistown, PA ‚Äì Norlund was a separate brand name of Mann Edge Tool Co. and its axes were produced in its Lewistown factory. A high-quality axe, many Norlund hatchets have a distinctive Hudson Bay (‚Äútomahawk‚Äù) pattern. These are much prized by collectors. The brand name was sold in 1992 to a California concern, although MET may have continued to make the axes. Ricker and Sons Co. (ca. 1854-1879), Flemington, PA ‚Äì Ricker and Sons Iron Works is listed in the Pennsylvania Iron Furnace Sourcebook, but some reports include ‚Äúaxe‚Äù also in the company name. Furey notes an iron works that was located on Walnut St. (now Walnut Dr. in Flemington), near Bald Eagle Canal.Furey, at 175. Probably this was this location that was purchased by Robert Mann in 1879, but it seems likely that Ricker never produced axes.Lamond (2012, at 20). Ricker is not mentioned in Robert Mann's autobiography. James Whitehill (ca. 1800-1821), Lemont, PA ‚Äì mentioned in J. Marvin Lee and other historic accounts of Centre County.Lee, at 21. Sometimes credited with making the first double-bit axe in North America.Linn, at 54.  Major Axe Producers and Factories in Pennsylvania (operating after 1900)  American Axe and Tool Co. (1889-1921), Beaver Falls & Glassport, PA ‚Äì AAT was formed in 1889 and constructed a large plant at Glassport, near Pittsburgh. This plant eventually employed 700-800 men. After the Trust formed in 1890, operations were progressively consolidated at Beaver Falls (site of the former Hubbard Axe Co.) and eventually at Glassport. Due to mergers, AAT axes were produced under many names and labels, including the Manns. A ‚ÄúGlassport‚Äù imprint is an easy identifier. The president of AAT in 1912-1915 was James P. Kelly, a grandson of William C. Kelly, founder of Kelly Axe. In 1921, all assets of AAT were purchased by Kelly Axe Mfg. Co. of WV. Barco Industries (1983-2016+), Reading, PA ‚Äì established in 1983, Barco acquired Kelly‚Äôs dies and brand names in 1987. Barco is now part of Phoenix Forge Group of companies. Barco‚Äôs tool catalog lists the following PFG products: light duty camp axe; light duty hatchet; Kelly Perfect Axes; Kelly Woodslasher Axes; fire axe; sport/camp axe; half hatchets; and other specialty hatchets (broad, lathing, box, rig builder, wall board). Except possibly for Kelly axes, production locations are unknown. Wm. Beatty & Son(s)/ Beatty Edge Tool Co. (1806-1924), Chester, PA ‚Äì early production occurred at Waterville and Springfield, near Philadelphia. In 1870, a large plant was built at Chester, with a workforce of 30-40 men and capacity of over 700 edge-tools per day, including axes and hatchets. The operation was known as ‚ÄúChester Edge Tool Works.‚Äù Beatty axes are distinguished by a stamped trademark of a bovine ‚Äústeer.‚Äù Excellent articles on Beatty appear in Mar 1995, Jun 2007, and Sep 2007 issues of The Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association. Reproductions of Beatty‚Äôs labels are in Lamond, Thomas C. (2011). Philadelphia axe manufacturers and related articles. Lynbrook, NY: Privately published. C. Hammond & Son (1869-1920?), Philadelphia & Ogontz, PA ‚Äì relatively little is known about this producer. Brand names included ‚ÄúC. Hammond,‚Äù ‚ÄúOgontz Tool,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTacony Solid Steel.‚Äù Mack Axe Co. (1913-1920), Beaver Falls, PA ‚Äì following a fire in 1909, AAT sold its Beaver Falls plant to Kelly, who in turn sold it to John Mack (a former AAT employee). He re- equipped the plant to produce edge tools of all types. It was a large operation, with a workforce of 135. In 1920, Mack was acquired by Winchester Repeating Arms Co., and its equipment was moved to New Haven, CN.Klenman, Allan and McPhail, Larry (2006, 2nd ed, at 46). Axe makers of North America. Blaine, WA: Privately published (available from Larry McPhail). Fayette R. Plumb Co./ Plumb Co. (1856-1910, 1910-1986?), Philadelphia, PA ‚Äì initially founded by Jonathan Yerkes in Frankfort, PA, the company moved to Church St. in Philadelphia around 1869. In 1887, Yerkes was bought out by a partner, Fayette Plumb, and a name change occurred around 1897. Yerkes & Plumb (Y & P) and Plumb products were often marketed under ‚ÄúAnchor Brand,‚Äù with a distinctive ‚Äúanchor‚Äù imprint. From 1910 to 1960, Plumb products were produced in St. Louis, MO. After 1960, production may have occurred in WV, NC, and Lewistown, PA. Plumb is now part of Apex Tool Group. Standard Axe and Tool Works (1892-1912), Ridgway, PA ‚Äì Standard completed construction of a new plant in 1892 to produce all types of axes, mining picks, etc. One product was ‚ÄúBlack Eagle,‚Äù marketed as a ‚Äúchemical process‚Äù axe and painted black. In 1894, the plant was destroyed by fire, and rebuilt. In 1912, Standard was acquired by Warren, and the equipment was moved to St. Catherines, Ontario.Klenman and McPhail, at 68. Warren Axe & Tool Co./ Sager Chemical (1893-1958), Warren, PA ‚Äì founded by William Sager in 1893. In 1895, Sager received a patent (no. 547,361) for a chemical process to treat axe heads as a means of preventing rust and to increase durability. The brand name ‚ÄúSager Chemical‚Äù was widely employed on its products. Warren expanded through a series of acquisitions of nearby producers: American Drop Forge (1907, Wayland, NY); Standard Axe & Tool Works (1912, Ridgway, PA); and Romer Axe (1916, Dunkirk, NY). Warren was acquired by Collins in 1950, but the plant continued to operate up to about 1958. Warren and Sager brand names may have continued to be used by Collins after 1958. White Axe Co. (1836-1928), Honesdale, PA ‚Äì established in 1836 by Ezekiel White, an axe factory was built in 1846 by a son, Ephraim, in Seelyville, near Honesdale.Klenman and McPhail, at 79. Some reports list Ezekiel as producing axes and edge tools as early as 1820. Destroyed by a fire in 1894, the factory was rebuilt and operated until about 1928. White Axe was sold in 1913 to L.J. Eddy. After 1928, MET may have purchased all assets and continued to market White‚Äôs brands. The company employed a number of euphemistic names, including ‚ÄúCommon Sense Axe,‚Äù ‚ÄúOld Reliable,‚Äù and ‚ÄúStub & Twist.‚Äù Bibliography * Africa, J. Simpson (1883).

It reflects an individuals estimated genetic predisposition for a given trait and can be used as a predictor for that trait. Polygenic scores are widely used in animal breeding and plant breeding (usually termed genomic prediction or genomic selection) due to their efficacy in improving livestock breeding and crops. They are also increasingly being used for risk prediction in humans for complex diseases which are typically affected by many genetic variants that each confer a small effect on overall risk.  History  An early (2006) example of a genetic risk score applied to Type 2 Diabetes in humans. Individuals with Type 2 diabetes (white bars) have a higher score than controls (black bars). One of the first precursors to the modern polygenic score was proposed under the term marker-assisted selection (MAS) in 1990. According to MAS, breeders are able to increase the efficiency of artificial selection by estimating the regression coefficients of genetic markers that are correlated with differences in the trait of interest and assigning individual animals a \\"score\\" from this information. A major development of these fundamentals was proposed in 2001 by researchers who discovered that the use of a Bayesian prior could help to mitigate the problem of the number of markers being greater than the sample of animals. These methods were first applied to humans in the late 2000s, starting with a proposal in 2007 that these scores could be used in human genetics to identify individuals at high risk for disease. This was successfully applied in empirical research for the first time in 2009 by researchers who organized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia to construct scores of risk propensity. This study was also the first to use the term polygenic score for a prediction drawn from a linear combination of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, which was able to explain 3% of the variance in schizophrenia.  Methods of construction  A polygenic score (PGS) is constructed from the \\"weights\\" derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In a GWAS, a set of genetic markers (usually SNPs) is genotyped on a training sample, and effect sizes are estimated for each marker's association with the trait of interest. These weights are then used to assign individualized polygenic scores in an independent replication sample. The estimated score, \\\\hat{S}, generally follows the form :\\\\hat{S} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m} X_{j} \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{j}, where the \\\\hat{S} of an individual is equal to the weighted sum of the individual's marker genotypes, X_j, at {m} SNPs. Weights are estimated using some form of regression analysis. Because the number of genomic variants is usually larger than the sample size, one cannot use OLS multiple regression (p > n problem). Researchers have proposed various methodologies that deal with this problem as well as how to generate the weights of the SNPs, \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{j}, and how to determine which {m} SNPs should be included.  Pruning and thresholding  The simplest so-called \\"pruning and thresholding\\" method of construction sets weights equal to the coefficient estimates from a regression of the trait on each genetic variant. The included SNPs may be selected using an algorithm that attempts to ensure that each marker is approximately independent. Failing to account for non-random association of genetic variants will typically reduce the score's predictive accuracy. This is important because genetic variants are often correlated with other nearby variants, such that the weight of a causal variant will be attenuated if it is more strongly correlated with its neighbors than a null variant. This is called linkage disequilibrium, a common phenomenon that arises from the shared evolutionary history of neighboring genetic variants. Further restriction can be achieved by multiple-testing different sets of SNPs selected at various thresholds, such as all SNPs which are genome-wide statistically-significant hits or all SNPs p < 0.05 or all SNPs with p < 0.50, and the one with greatest performance used for further analysis; especially for highly polygenic traits, the best polygenic score will tend to use most or all SNPs.  Bayesian methods  Bayesian approaches, originally pioneered in concept in 2001, attempt to explicitly model preexisting genetic architecture, thereby accounting for the distribution of effect sizes with a prior that should improve the accuracy of a polygenic score. One of the most popular modern Bayesian methods uses \\"linkage disequilibrium prediction\\" (LDpred for short) to set the weight for each SNP equal to the average of its posterior distribution after linkage disequilibrium has been accounted for. LDpred tends to outperform simpler methods of pruning and thresholding, especially at large sample sizes; for example, its estimations have improved the predicted variance of a polygenic score for schizophrenia in a large data set from 20.1% to 25.3%.  Penalized regression  Penalized regression methods, such as LASSO and ridge regression, can also be used to improve the accuracy of polygenic scores. Penalized regression can be interpreted as placing informative prior probabilities on how many genetic variants are expected to affect a trait, and the distribution of their effect sizes. In other words, these methods in effect \\"penalize\\" the large coefficients in a regression model and shrink them conservatively. Ridge regression accomplishes this by shrinking the prediction with a term that penalizes the sum of the squared coefficients. LASSO accomplishes something similar by penalizing the sum of absolute coefficients. Bayesian counterparts exist for LASSO and ridge regression, and other priors have been suggested and used. They can perform better in some circumstances. A multi-dataset, multi-method study found that of 15 different methods compared across four datasets, minimum redundancy maximum relevance was the best performing method. Furthermore, variable selection methods tended to outperform other methods. Variable selection methods do not use all the available genomic variants present in a dataset, but attempt to select an optimal subset of variants to use. This leads to less overfitting but more bias (see bias-variance tradeoff).  Predictive performance  The benefit of polygenic scores is that they can be used to predict the future for crops, animal breeding, and humans alike. Although the same basic concepts underlie these areas of prediction, they face different challenges that require different methodologies. The ability to produce very large family size in nonhuman species, accompanied by deliberate selection, leads to a smaller effective population, higher degrees of linkage disequilibrium among individuals, and a higher average genetic relatedness among individuals within a population. For example, members of plant and animal breeds that humans have effectively created, such as modern maize or domestic cattle, are all technically \\"related\\". In human genomic prediction, by contrast, unrelated individuals in large populations are selected to estimate the effects of common SNPs. Because of smaller effective population in livestock, the mean coefficient of relationship between any two individuals is likely high, and common SNPs will tag causal variants at greater physical distance than for humans; this is the major reason for lower SNP-based heritability estimates for humans compared to livestock. In both cases, however, sample size is key for maximizing the accuracy of genomic prediction. While modern genomic prediction scoring in humans is generally referred to as a \\"polygenic score\\" (PGS) or a \\"polygenic risk score\\" (PRS), in livestock the more common term is \\"genomic estimated breeding value\\", or GEBV (similar to the more familiar \\"EBV\\", but with genotypic data). Conceptually, a GEBV is the same as a PGS: a linear function of genetic variants that are each weighted by the apparent effect of the variant. Despite this, polygenic prediction in livestock is useful for a fundamentally different reason than for humans. In humans, a PRS is used for the prediction of individual phenotype, while in livestock a GEBV is typically used to predict the offspring‚Äôs average value of a phenotype of interest in terms of the genetic material it inherited from a parent. In this way, a GEBV can be understood as the average of the offspring of an individual or pair of individual animals. GEBVs are also typically communicated in the units of the trait of interest. For example, the expected increase in milk production of the offspring of a specific parent compared to the offspring from a reference population might be a typical way of using a GEBV in dairy cow breeding and selection. Some accuracy values are given in the sections below for comparison purposes. These are given in terms of correlations and have been converted from explained variance if given in that format in the source.  In plants  The predictive value of polygenic scoring has large practical benefits for plant and animal breeding because it increases the selection precision and allows for shorter generations, both of which speed up evolution. Genomic prediction with some version of polygenic scoring has been used in experiments on maize, small grains such as barley, wheat, oats and rye, and rice biparental families. In many cases, these predictions have been so successful that researchers have advocated for its use in combating global population growth and climate change. * In 2015, r ‚âà 0.55 for total root length in maize. * In 2014, r ‚âà 0.03 to 0.99 across four traits in barley.

In humans  For humans, polygenic scores can be used to predict future disease susceptibility and for embryo selection. As of 2019, polygenic scores from well over a hundred phenotypes have been developed from genome-wide association statistics. These include scores that can be categorized as anthropometric, behavioral, cardiovascular, non-cancer illness, psychiatric/neurological, and response to treatment/medication. * In 2016, r ‚âà 0.30 for educational attainment variation at age 16. This polygenic score was based on a GWAS using data from 293,000 people. * In 2016, r ‚âà 0.31 for case/control status for first-episode psychosis. * In 2018, r ‚âà 0.67 for height variation in adulthood, resulting in prediction within ~3cm for most individuals in the study.  Non-predictive uses  In humans, polygenic scores were originally computed in an effort to predict the prevalence and etiology of complex, heritable diseases, which are typically affected by many genetic variants that individually confer a small effect to overall risk. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a such a polygenic trait is able to identify these individual genetic loci of small effect in a large enough sample, and various methods of aggregating the results can be used to form a polygenic score. This score will typically explain at least a few percent of a phenotype's variance, and can therefore be assumed to effectively incorporate a significant fraction of the genetic variants affecting that phenotype. A polygenic score can be used in several different ways: as a lower bound to test whether heritability estimates may be biased; as a measure of genetic overlap of traits (genetic correlation), which might indicate e.g. shared genetic bases for groups of mental disorders; as a means to assess group differences in a trait such as height, or to examine changes in a trait over time due to natural selection indicative of a soft selective sweep (as e.g. for intelligence where the changes in frequency would be too small to detect on each individual hit but not on the overall polygenic score); in Mendelian randomization (assuming no pleiotropy with relevant traits); to detect & control for the presence of genetic confounds in outcomes (e.g. the correlation of schizophrenia with poverty); or to investigate gene‚Äìenvironment interactions and correlations.

Palmer was recognized for her field/doctoral study on veneracean lamellibranches, (reprinted in Geological Society Memorials 17:1-4. 1986 a class of bivalve mollusks that include clams, scallops and oysters. Palmer was a director of the Paleontological Research Institution in New York. At this position, Palmer oversaw the publication of numerous Bulletins of American Paleontology as well as several issues of Palaeontographica Americana.  Early life  Palmer was born to Jacob Van Winkle and Edith Van Winkle in Oakville, Washington, where she spent her youth. In 1918, she received her bachelor of science degree at the University of Washington,. She was a member of the Alpha Delta Pi chapter.The Adelphean of Alpha Delta Pi, April 1921, vol. 13(2), p. 135. She wrote her thesis on the Oligocene fossils found in the Chehalis Valley in Washington. At the University of Washington, she worked as the laboratory assistant to Charles E. Weaver, who focused his study on Tertiary fauna. After graduation, Palmer continued her education at Cornell University where she received her Ph.D in 1925. During her studies there, Palmer met and married Ephraim L. Palmer, who was a Professor of Rural Education and Nature Study. At Cornell, Palmer worked closely with professor Gilbert Harris, helping him create the Paleontological Research Institution.  Career  Palmer and Harris established the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI) together in 1932, and in 1952 she replaced Harris as director, a post she occupied until 1978. While at this position, Palmer oversaw the publication of 150 Bulletins of American Paleontology as well as 20 issues of Palaeontographica Americana. As well as founding and overseeing the two publications, Palmer was a life trustee of both. The same year that Palmer died (1982), she published the first history of the PRI, securing her own, as well as the PRI's, legacy in print. Palmer's research produced more than 150 publications, including Gastropoda of the Claibornian Mid-Eocene of the Southern United States (1937), The Mollusca of the Jackson Eocene of the Mississippi Embayment (Sabine River to Alabama River) (1946), and Catalogue of the Paleocene, and Eocene Mollusca of the Southern and Eastern United States (1965), to name a few. As well as conducting field studies in the United States, Palmer conducted research in the Gulf of Mexico, New Zealand, and the West Indies. In 1935, Palmer was appointed Fellow of the Geological Society of America. Palmer was also president of the Malacological Society, an organization dedicated to the research and preservation of mollusks. Palmer received the Paleontological Society Medal in 1972 as well as the Western Society of Malacologists Award in 1974 in honour of her lifelong contribution to geology.

Her work ranges from still life to landscape via portrait and is notable for its combination of a traditional painterly style with an almost abstract approach to her subject matter. She was named as one of the 'Top 20 New British Art Talents' by Tatler magazine in 2008, describing her as ‚Äòthe new Paula Rego. Based on footfall (3,329 per day), Nancy Cadogan's solo show Mind Zero at the Saatchi Gallery was one of the top 100 most popular exhibitions in the world in 2019. Life and career Born in Cincinnati, United States, Cadogan led a peripatetic early childhood, including stints in Crete and Cyprus with her father, the eminent archaeologist Gerald Cadogan. The family settled in the UK and Cadogan attended Oxford High School followed by City and Guilds of London Art School before graduating from Canterbury Christ Church University with Degree in Fine Art Painting in 2002. She moved to New York shortly after, sharing a studio in the Starrett-Lehigh Building with artist Franco Ciarlo. Success came quickly with sell-out solo shows at Frost & Reed, New York in 2005 and 2006, the former featuring ‚Äúa series of dramatic paintings depicting the vast Utah landscapes.‚Äù In 2008 Cadogan returned to the UK and followed her early success with another solo show at Sladmore Contemporary, London. With breaks for motherhood, she continues to paint from her studio in Northamptonshire and most recently featured in shows with Art Bastion. Miami, in Miami and Southampton, USA and The Blue Edition in London. In 2017, along with Tracey Emin, Rachael Whiteread and Cornelia Parker she was one of 93 women artists chosen to exhibit their work in The Ned, London, in its permanent Vault 100 exhibition highlighting the disparity between women and men CEOs. Artistic style Mind Clutter, 2019 Cadogan's paintings are characterised by a contrast between a traditional painterly style, a strong design element, and landscapes filtered through the imagination to become almost abstract. She was taught by the school of Euan Uglow and her painting style shows the influence of his work. Other influences include early David Hockney, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Paul Cezanne and Georges De La Tour. She predominantly works with oil on board, linen and canvas. Much of her earlier work focused on portrait and landscapes, and \\"demonstrate[s] a skillful and purposeful use of colour, balanced with planes and spaces that draw your eye out into large vistas.\\" In more recent work, which can be seen on Artsy and Art Sales Index, Nancy turns to the concepts of stillness and place, both in the sense of a still life and the various emotional connotations held semantically. Her works are deceptively simple but require deep reading. She has stated, \\"I am interested in stillness, not only in the sense of a still life and how that tradition explores the passing of time, but actual physical stillness.\\" Critics have also noted her strong use of colour, particularly blues. Cadogan's subject matter has included Morocco, Utah and Lake Como. In recent work Cadogan has focused on still lives, almost exclusively books. In one sense, the works are typical of the still life genre and record a sense of time passing. In another, they reflect on the concept of stillness more widely, as a rare condition within our hyper-networked contemporary reality, and instead celebrate quiet reflection. As Cadogan has stated, ‚ÄòThe book ‚Äì the actual physical paper bound object full of words ‚Äì is a treasure in this modern era. A book contains an entire universe you can only bring to life in your imagination, if you agree to give it time. It is a tribute to privacy, an honouring of the interior life.' In recent works Cadogan has chosen to focus on large-scale pieces reflecting the beauty of the every day and the inner life of the mind. Saatchi Gallery Director Philippa Adams stated, \\"‚ÄúNancy‚Äôs works delightfully capture the sensation of being lost in one‚Äôs own thoughts.

Grandm√®re was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 180 The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Grandm√®re had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. The minesweeper was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt gun mounted forward. The ship was also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII aft and were eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 46 Those ships assigned to convoy duty were armed with two depth charge launchers and four chutes to deploy their 40 depth charges. Grandm√®re was equipped with SA and LL minesweeping gear for the detection of acoustic and magnetic naval mines. Operational history=War service The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1940‚Äì41 building programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 2 June 1941 by Canadian Vickers at their shipyard in Montreal, Quebec. Named for a town in Quebec, Grandm√®re was launched on 21 August 1941. The minesweeper was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 December 1941.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 182 While making her way to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Grandm√®re broke down in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on 21 December and was towed to Sydney, Nova Scotia by the corvette . While undergoing repairs at Sydney following the breakdown, the ship suffered damage to the No. 2 boiler. To repair that damage required being towed to Pictou, Nova Scotia. The repairs were not completed until May 1942. Grandm√®re arrived at Halifax on 5 May 1942. The minesweeper was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force as a convoy escort followed by an assignment with Sydney Force, the local patrol and escort unit operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. On 14 October 1942 while with Sydney Force, Grandm√®re was escorting the Newfoundland Railway ferry on its weekly passage in the Cabot Strait from North Sydney to Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland. The two vessels were spotted by the German U-boat with the minesweeper off the starboard quarter of the ferry. The submarine fired one torpedo at the ferry which caused the boilers aboard Caribou to explode. The vessel sank in minutes.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, pp. 462‚Äì63 The minesweeper closed with the sinking ship and spotted the U-boat away. Grandm√®re attempted to ram U-69, but the submarine dived beneath the site of the sinking, expecting the minesweeper to not drop depth charges among the survivors. The minesweeper continued hunting the German submarine for two hours before returning to the site of the sinking and picking up survivors. 101 passengers and crew of the ferry were recovered. The minesweeper then transferred to Halifax Force as a convoy escort and the Halifax Local Defence Force as a patrol vessel. In July 1943, Grandm√®re underwent a refit at Louisburg, Nova Scotia that took seven weeks to complete. In September 1944, a second refit was performed in Sydney and completed in Halifax. The ship was paid off on 23 October 1945 at Sydney and placed in reserve at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Postwar service The vessel was sold to private interests in 1947 and converted to a yacht.Colledge, p. 270 Renamed Elda and operated by Saguenay Terminals Ltd, the vessel was registered in Montreal. In 1951 Elda was sold to Three Bays Corp Ltd and converted to a cargo ship and renamed Jacks Bay. The ship was registered in Nassau, Bahamas. Ownership was transferred to Victorene Nav Co Ltd in 1959 and again in 1960 to Caribbean-Hamburg Ltd. In 1961 the cargo ship was sold to Proton Corp and renamed Proton. The registry was changed from Nassau to Panama. In 1968 the Jacks Bay was sold to Pinto Island Metal Co and broken up in Mobile, Alabama.

As director of Denison House in Boston from 1893 to 1912, she was an influential leader in the early settlement movement, and aided thousands of poor and working-class immigrants at a time when government relief programs were lacking. Appalled by the working conditions in local sweatshops, which she learned of through her settlement house neighbors, she became increasingly active in the labor movement. She helped organize the Women's Trade Union League in 1903, and supported the Bread and Roses strike in 1912. After World War I she worked to promote the League of Nations, and for many years she was a leading member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.  Biography = Early life  Dudley was born in Florence, Nebraska, the only child of Judson H. and Caroline Bates Dudley. Her father was one of the original settlers of Denver, Colorado, and made a fortune in silver mining and real estate. During Helena's childhood her father's financial situation fluctuated dramatically and the family moved from place to place around the Western United States. At the age of 26 she entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied for a year before transferring to Bryn Mawr College. As a biology major, she helped pay her way through school by working as a laboratory assistant, graduating in 1889 with the first Bryn Mawr class.Davis (1971), pp. 526. After graduating, she taught biology at the Pratt Institute and the Packer Institute, both in Brooklyn.Bryn Mawr obituary, p. 23. In May 1890 she joined the College Settlements' Association (CSA), a group of college-educated women who operated settlement houses in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. In 1892 she gave up her teaching career to become the first \\"head worker\\" at the CSA settlement house in Philadelphia. When Emily Greene Balch resigned as head of Denison House in 1893, Dudley moved to Boston to replace her.Williams (2015), p. 251.  Denison House  Dudley served as head worker, or director in residence, at Denison House from 1893 to 1912. Arriving during the Panic of 1893, she immediately set to work organizing the house as a relief agency that could distribute such basic necessities as milk and coal. In December she started a sewing room, which employed 324 women over the winter. The Wells Memorial Institute provided the workrooms rent-free, and Dudley raised funds for materials and other expenses. For a flat wage of 75 cents a day, the women manufactured undergarments, hospital gowns, bed linen, and the like for institutions such as the Red Cross and Boston City Hospital. In her written account of the project, Dudley was careful to note that the women were not competing with local businesses; for example, hospital gowns were usually made by nurses in their spare time at work.Dudley (1894), p. 63. Under her direction, Denison House became an important neighborhood center, offering classes in nursing, English literature, crafts, cooking, and carpentry, as well as sports and a summer camp for children, and clubs for adults. It had a library, a gymnasium, and a clinic. Later, Dudley cooperated with Robert Archey Woods and other residents of South End House--Boston's first settlement house, located just a few blocks away--to hold art exhibitions, conduct housing investigations, and campaign for public bathhouses and gymnasiums. Along with Woods and other movement leaders such as Jane Addams and Mary Simkhovitch, she helped organize the National Federation of Settlements in 1908.  Labor activism  Most settlement workers were upper-middle- to upper-class women who, as Dudley acknowledged, had at least as much to learn from the community as they had to give to it.Dudley (1898), p. 495. In a speech at Wesleyan Hall in 1895, Dudley said that the college women had learned, through their work at the settlement house, \\"of the conditions which press upon the wage earners. We have found women making shirts for 37 and a half cents a dozen...and it is because of this knowledge that we have become interested in trade unions.\\" Increasingly, Dudley came to believe that settlements, useful as they were to the community, could not provide what working people needed most: a living wage. She was no doubt influenced by Mary Kenney O'Sullivan and her husband, both labor activists, who lived at Denison House in the 1890s. Another colleague, Vida Scudder, helped organize the Federal Labor Union (FLU), a group of \\"professional people\\" affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.National Cyclopaedia (1897), p. 469. Dudley joined the union and served as its delegate to the Boston Central Labor Union for several years. Through the FLU, she and other Denison House residents organized Boston's garment workers in 1894. It was one of several unions that held regular meetings at Denison House during Dudley's tenure.Davis (1971), p. 527. In 1903, all three women--Dudley, O'Sullivan, and Scudder--helped organize the Women's Trade Union League. O'Sullivan became secretary of the organization, and Dudley served for a time as vice president of its Boston branch.Williams (2015), p. 261. A few years later, all three women suffered professional consequences for supporting the 1912 Lawrence textile strike. Scudder gave a speech to the strikers that was widely publicized, and nearly lost her teaching position at Wellesley. Dudley and O'Sullivan were mentioned in the Boston Globe when they paid the bail of $500 each for Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, strike leaders who had been arrested on trumped-up charges. O'Sullivan subsequently lost her job at the WTUL, and Dudley and Scudder were forced to resign from Denison House.  Later years  Helena Dudley became Cornelia Lyman Warren's friend. Warren bought the location for the first Denison House. When Dudley retired in 1912, Warren built her a house at her family estate, Cedar Hill. Dudley lived at Cedar Hill until Warren died in 1921. After retirement Dudley focused her volunteer efforts on the cause of world peace. She joined the board of the Massachusetts branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and remained involved with that organization for the rest of her life. After World War I she worked to promote the League of Nations, making several trips to Europe. In the 1920s she joined the Socialist party. A devout Episcopalian, Dudley was also a member of the Companionship of the Holy Cross, and volunteered at Adelynrood, the society's retreat center in Byfield, Massachusetts. During the last decade of her life, she lived with her close friend Scudder in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In 1932, she and Scudder attended the seventh congress of the Women's International League in Grenoble, France. Shortly afterwards, while visiting friends in Geneva, Switzerland, Dudley was taken ill and died at the age of 74.Bryn Mawr obituary, p. 24. Dudley is remembered in connection with Denison House on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

In June 2011, he founded the Alliance for Change party, which later became Human Shield. He was a member of Croatian Parliament from the 2016 elections to May 2020, having been elected in the 6th electoral district on the joint party list of Human Shield, Let's Change Croatia and Youth Action. On 5 June 2019, he announced that he left the Human Shield party that he founded in 2011 as a reason for his decision, that the president of the party Ivan Vilibor Sinƒçiƒá and his wife turned into a private property. On 6 June, at a press conference held in the Croatian Parliament, he stated that he had requested the deletion of the Human Shield membership and that he would set up a new party on 7 July 2019. The party is called Party of Ivan Pernar. He ran for president in the Croatian presidential election that were held in December 2019, finishing 7th after winning 2.31% of votes. Personal life Pernar finished 10th Gymnasium in Zagreb and then enrolled at University of Applied Health Sciences in Zagreb, where he earned Bachelor of Nursing degree. Pernar has a son, Mathis Ivan Alexis, with a German woman named Friederike. His grandfather's uncle, also named Ivan Pernar, was a member of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for the Croatian Peasant Party and was one of several Croatian politicians wounded by People's Radical Party MP Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá on June 20, 1928. On 11 August 2019, Ivan and his long term partner Viktorija welcomed their first son named Noa. The child was born healthy but due to the parent's views, the child was not vaccinated. Political career=Green List Pernar joined the Green List in 2009. However, he was expelled from the party in November 2010. In February 2011, Vlasta Toth, the party's president at the time, told Veƒçernji List that Pernar was expelled due to his political beliefs. She claimed that while Pernar was a council member of the Green Party in Stenjevec, he told an audience of around 150 people during a panel on urbanism that \\"intellectual gossip doesn't lead to anything\\" and that \\"he read Mein Kampf from which he learned how to influence the masses.\\" Pernar responded to the Veƒçernji List piece, admitting his reference to Mein Kampf. 2011 protests against Jadranka Kosor Pernar was one of the organizers of massive \\"Facebook protests\\" in 2011 aimed against the government under the administration of Jadranka Kosor. The protests started in Zagreb, and then spread to all major Croatian cities such as Pula, Split, Rijeka and Slavonski Brod. Despite initial success in mobilizing and leading as many as a thousand people, he soon came to the verge of being physically attacked by the same protesters in Osijek, for mongering people to burn a flag. After the protests, he founded his own political party \\"Alliance for Changes\\", which soon changed its name to Human Shield. Along with other members of his party, Pernar soon engaged in passive resistance to forced evictions in Croatia, for which he was, according to his own account often arrested by the police. Election to the Croatian Parliament In the Croatian parliamentary election, in September 2016, Pernar won 15.66% of preferential votes of his constituency and thus entered the Croatian Parliament for the first time. After one month of work, he became credited as the most active MP in Croatian Parliament by the Croatian media. On November 29, 2016, Stjepan Vujaniƒá, president of political party \\"Alphabet of Democracy\\", announced that Pernar would become a member of his party. Pernar later explained that he made this move as a revolt because Croatian Ministry of Public Administration refused to register his new political party \\"The Only Option\\". On October 11, 2016, he was criticized by parliament speaker ≈Ωeljko Reiner for eating pizza during a session. On December 14, 2016, Pernar accused Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts of being \\"a decorative office, cultural poseurs and quasi-intellectuals\\" for not dealing with issues of relevance for Croatian society. On January 20, 2017, Pernar and his party colleague Ivan Vilibor Sinƒçiƒá became the first MPs to have been forcibly expelled from the parliament since Croatia's independence, after Pernar refused to leave the session on order of speaker ≈Ωeljko Reiner. Views=Criticism of the Catholic Church in Croatia In January 2017, Pernar declared that he no longer identified as a Roman Catholic, and accused the Catholic Church in Croatia of being \\"the long arm of Croatian Democratic Union\\". He criticized the Catholic Church for \\"banning marriage of clergy members, worship in front of statues, and the infallibility of the Pope\\". In an interview with Total Croatia News, Pernar stood against the funding of the Catholic Church from the state budget, indicating that it caused a perverse incentive for the Catholic Church to participate in partisan politics: When he was asked about his alleged impartiality to the Serbian Orthodox Church, Pernar said that the Orthodox Church \\"realized its mistake from the time when it advocated for nationalism, and it is not longer advocating that in Croatia.\\" Referring to the Republika Srpska Krajina as \\"the insurgency\\", Pernar added that \\"Orthodox priests took part in the insurgency, which ended catastrophically for the Serbian people.\\" Pernar and the Serbian Orthodox Church became a focus of the local press again on January 6, 2017, when he attended a Badnjak ceremony after having been invited by a Serbian Orthodox Church. He later wrote on his Facebook page that \\"the Serbian Orthodox Church does not have the goal of bringing the Croatian Democratic Union to the government, and does not interfere with our politics and deals with religious questions. That cannot be said for the Catholic Church\\". Index.hr reported that Pernar's writings received a series of chauvinist Facebook comments and that he was also called a \\"communist\\" by many readers. Former Yugoslavia In a discussion with Boris Malagurski in December 2016, when Pernar was asked who he thought was responsible for the breakup of Yugoslavia, Pernar replied, \\"all the peoples equally, but most of all Milo≈°eviƒá who wanted to lead a dictatorship, instead of a loose confederation, which actually made a new co-existence of Yugoslavia impossible since he wanted Serbs to govern over all the others.\\" Pernar also gave a mixed assessment about Josip Broz Tito for whom he said, \\"[Tito] built factories, defended workers' rights, for this I take my hat off\\". However, he criticized Tito on the grounds of the Bleiburg repatriations, to which he referred when he said, \\"after World War II he liquidated tens of thousands of Croats, for that I would take off his head.\\" When Pernar was asked whether he is for the reunification of Yugoslavia, he replied that \\"for an economic [Yugoslavia] yes, but co-existence in the sense of a united state is thoughtless.\\" In an interview with Moja Hercegovina, Pernar elaborated his views on Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time. He stated that \\"Serbs in Republika Srpska, although they have their own entity, do not have anything of it. People are moving out, children are not being born, and all of that is a consequence which leads to the disappearance of Serbs in this region.\\" He argued that Bosnia and Herzegovina should be more united, and spoke against Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina having their own entity, adding that Serbs \\"would not get anything\\" from Republika Srpska gaining independence. In November 2016, Pernar published a Facebook post exploring the reasoning behind Srebrenica genocide denial, and began with, \\"I noticed that some Serbs are afraid to be labeled as a genocidal people if they admit there was genocide in Srebrenica.\\" In the same piece, he wrote that the Independent State of Croatia (using the term \\"Croatian government\\") was responsible for genocide in Jasenovac, and that Operation Storm was an act of ethnic cleansing. However, he distinguished the Croatian people from the government, asserting that the responsibility was that of a \\"genocidal group of people and those who were manipulated by their politics.\\" His party, Human Shield, subsequently published a statement distancing from Pernar's statements about Jasenovac and Operation Storm, saying that \\"...in the case of assessing events from the Croatian past he didn't only not put forward opinions of the party, moreover, he put forward opinions which are the opposite of the overwhelming majority of the membership of Human Shield.\\" Foreign policyEuropean Union= In an interview with Croatian news site 4Dportal, Pernar said that his party is \\"against entry into the European Union because it is ruled by unelected banker cartels and bureaucrats, there is no democracy [in the EU].\\" In another interview, he stated that his party would only consider a coalition with other parties if they challenge or terminate Croatia's membership of the European Union. =NATO= In an October 2016 discussion with Sputnik, Pernar stated that \\"NATO supports overthrowing legitimate governments through bombings instead of advocating democracy.\\" On November 23, 2016, Pernar spoke to the Croatian Parliament against the ratification of Montenegro's accession to NATO, reading a letter written by Montenegrin activist Marko Milaƒçiƒá. YouTube: Ivan Pernar u Saboru ƒçita pismo Marka Milaƒçiƒáa poslanicima Hrvatske (in Croatian). November 23, 2016. Accessed April 22, 2017. =Israel and Palestine= In a guest appearance for Bosnian channel OSM Televizija's talk show called \\"Face of the Nation\\", Pernar said that Israel was responsible for ethnic cleansing in the 1948 Palestinian exodus. In November 2016, Pernar wore a Palestinian scarf to the Croatian Parliament. = Gulf of Piran Dispute = In his interview to Novi List, Pernar advocated deployment of Croatian Navy vessels to Gulf of Piran, adding that Slovenia has no navy and that by doing so, Croatia would send the message to Slovenia - \\"ours is bigger\\". Social issues In September 2016, Pernar participated in a discussion with LGBT portal Crol.hr about the LGBT community in Croatia. Pernar said that \\"homosexuals are not an endangered group\\", but stated that they are \\"one of a long series of groups which the clerical right turned their backs on.\\" Pernar gave a mixed assessment of gay activism in Croatia, saying that \\"unfortunately, some gay activists reduce their struggle to a narrow spectrum of society\\". However, he did say that homosexuals should have protection from the state, saying \\"so that if their parents throw them out of their homes they don't have to prostitute themselves in order to not become homeless, so that they can have normal jobs, pay, and so they don't live in fear of [law] enforcement or the cutting off of electricity and water.\\" In December 2016, Pernar argued for the legalization of marijuana in Croatia. He suggested that it would reduce emigration from Croatia if it were legalized because of the huge economic benefits legalisation brings.  Major construction projects in Croatia  Pelje≈°ac Bridge = Pernar described the construction of the Pelje≈°ac bridge as \\"madness\\", adding that the project is too expensive, while at the same time putting Croatia into conflict with Bosnia and Herzegovina. He went on to say that this bridge is only being built to provoke Bosnia and predicted that it will surely become a failed investment. Controversies In October 2016, Pernar was a guest to TV personality Vesna Kljajiƒá on Z1 Television. Pernar claimed he had met Freemasons while visiting the Czech Republic. He alleged that the Freemasons offered him power and media exposure, under the condition that he \\"does not bring into question the process of making money\\". He said that he rejected this offer in favor of going his own way, and recommended to all viewers to turn their hearts towards Jesus. In the same interview Pernar said that some MPs in Croatian parliament aren't loyal to the state, but to the secret societies instead. In October 2016, Pernar accused Croatian lawyer and media magnate Marijan Han≈æekoviƒá of \\"being a Freemason of the 33rd degree who sold his soul to the devil and attacks everyone who opposes him using his disgusting yellow journalism\\". Han≈æekoviƒá responded by raising a lawsuit for libel against Pernar and asked the Croatian parliament to relieve Pernar of his immunity. Pernar commented on the lawsuit, saying, \\"Han≈æekoviƒá is Satan's delegate which insults him for the last five years\\", and stood by his earlier allegations on Han≈æekoviƒá and Freemasonry. He also said that he puts \\"his parliamentary mandate into the hands of Jesus Christ\\". The Credentials and Privileges Commission of Croatian Parliament concluded that Pernar's immunity should be left unchanged, but warned him not to use foul language and hard words anymore. After Han≈æekoviƒá passed away on January 28, 2018., Pernar dubbed Han≈æekoviƒá \\"a human form of garbage\\" on his Facebook page and announced that he will celebrate Han≈æekoviƒá's death with a pizza. Following day, Facebook temporary blocked Pernar's profile. In November 2016, Pernar was a guest for Croatian talk show Nedjeljom u 2. After fifteen minutes, he abandoned the studio and accused TV host Aleksandar Stankoviƒá of not allowing him to finish his talking points. He later uploaded a video to social media, in which he threatened to fire Stankoviƒá should his party come to power. Stankoviƒá responded by filing a lawsuit against Pernar, stating that he started to receive threats as a result of the Pernar conflict. The Credentials and Privileges Commission did not challenge Pernar's immunity, but instead expressed criticism towards Pernar's behavior. After civil lawsuit Stankoviƒá won the case in court and Pernar was ordered to pay the compensation of 50,000 kunas. In December 2016, the Credentials and Privileges Commission decided to relieve Pernar of his parliamentary immunity for spraying a graffiti in Sesvete. In his defense, Pernar referred to a passage from the Bible known as Pericope Adulterae, after which the Speaker of the Parliament ≈Ωeljko Reiner remarked that Pernar compared himself to Jesus. Pernar denied that he compared himself to Jesus, calling himself \\"not worthy even to wash his legs.\\" However, in regards to the accusations of Jesus comparisons, Pernar did say, \\"I have a similar role to his. We are both victims of false political processes.\\" On December 26, 2016, Pernar expressed his doubts on the Berlin terrorist attack in a Facebook post. In his post, he shared a video by Gerhard Wisnewski which claimed that there were no proven victims or evidence of the attack. Pernar subsequently claimed that he deliberately published \\"de facto fake news\\" to see if his post would be covered more by Croatian publications Index.hr and Telegram than the affairs surrounding Ivo Sanader and the arbitration of Tomislav Karamarko. On January 9, 2017, Pernar wrote a Facebook status claiming that pharmaceutical companies make poisoned vaccines which \\"mark people like livestock\\". Furthermore, he asked his followers why. \\"such small needles leave such big marks\\" and why \\"vaccined children develop autism\\". Such claims drew criticism from the local media ranging from calling Pernar a conspiracy theorist, to referring to the MMR vaccine controversy case in order to dismiss his claims. Croatian Children's Ombudsman Ivana Milas- Klariƒá and certain pediatricians also expressed outrage for Pernar's claims. Milas-Klariƒá accused Pernar that by publishing such status, he violated the Article 24 of UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child which guarantees children the \\"highest attainable standard of health\\" and described his actions as \\"sad\\". Later that month, three different schools from Zagreb reported Pernar to the police due to unauthorized entry, ignoring warnings of their employees, and taking selfies with minors without parental permission. In his text messages to one of the students, Pernar asked a student to skip class to meet him. Croatian Children's Ombudsman Ivana Milas-Klariƒá, called the text messages \\"concerning\\", and criticized Pernar for using the students for political and self-promotion. Later, Pernar criticized her behaviour during Parliament debate, voted for her removal from office and new Children's Ombudsman became Helena Pirnat Dragiƒçeviƒá. In March 2017, Pernar interviewed English conspiracy theorist David Icke. Later he shared a Facebook photo with Icke and the two men briefly walked together near Croatian Parliament. In his Facebook post, David Icke described Pernar as: \\"a politician worth listening\\", while he described Pernar's political party as party inspired by his work. In turn, in his interview in 2011, Pernar described Icke as a man: \\"who speaks many truths but also has to insert in some fiction, otherwise his messages would be too dangerous for political and financial elites.\\" Serbian film director Boris Malagurski also supported Pernar by making a video of Pernar's anti-NATO speech in Croatian Parliament. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia, Pernar expressed opposition to the measures introduced as a measure to deal with the pandemic, suggesting among other things that the economic toll of the measures imposed by the government is too great of a price to pay for the only benefit of prolonging the lives of some old people who only had a few more years to live in any case.

As such, Candidalysin is a rare fungal example of a classical virulence factor. Hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans is associated with damage to host epithelial cells; during this process Candidalysin is released. Candidalysin promotes damage of oral epithelial cells by inducing lactate dehydrogenase release and calcium ion influx. It is unique in the fact that it is the first peptide toxin to be identified in any human fungal pathogen. C. albicans produces the protein Ece1 (extent of cell elongation 1) during the formation of hyphae. Cleavage of Ece1 at arginine/lysine residues by Kex2 and Kex1 releases several peptides, including the toxin Candidalysin. Consequently, Candidalysin is also known as Ece1-III62‚Äì92K. C. albicans strains missing Candidalysin do not damage epithelial cells and are said to be avirulent with respect to mucosal infections. The toxin is also responsible for the activation and propagation of a cellular immune response.  Epithelial Damage  As Ece1-III62‚Äì92K levels accumulate, it evokes direct tissue damage. Candidalysin promotes damage of oral epithelial cells by inducing the release of lactate dehydrogenase and calcium ion influx which are characteristics of membrane destabilization and cell damage. Candidalysin is able to cause epithelial damage through permeabilization, pore formation, and membrane intercalation. It can cause IL-1Œ≤ production and is a driver of inflammasome activation in macrophages.  Immune response  Epithelial immunity can recognize Ece1-III62‚Äì92K without harming cells. Epithelial cells have evolved to particularly recognize the peptide, which indicates that during mucosal infection the fungus secretes this toxin. Immune cells can either be exposed extracellularly or intracellularly and this is due to the fact that phagocytes can be exposed to the fungal hyphae pre-phagocytosis or post-phagocytosis. Epithelial immunity is achieved predominantly through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, more specifically the p38 pathway. The p38 pathway leads to the activation of AP-1 transcription factor c-Fos and the ERK1/2 pathway. The ERK1/2 pathway then leads to the activation of the enzyme MAPK phosphatase 1 which regulates the immune response.  p38 MAPK Pathway  The p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is similar to the JNK pathway but differs from the ERK pathway. The p38 MAP kinase, JNK MAP kinase, and ERK MAP kinase are all types of mammalian MAP kinases. The p38 MAP kinase is activated by two other MAP kinases known as MKK3 and MKK4. MKK4 is also known to activate the JNK MAP kinase, however, MKK3 is unique to the p38 MAP kinase. The p38 MAPK pathway is required to be activated by dual phosphorylation of the amino acids: tyrosine and threonine and also environmental stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Examples of environmental stress than can activate the p38 MAP Kinase include UV radiation and osmotic stress. Examples of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can activate the p38 MAP Kinase include tumor necrosis factor, Interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The p38 MAP kinase plays an important role in regulating Interleukin-10 synthesis and toll-like receptor signaling.  MAPK Phosphatase MKP1  MAPK Phosphatase 1 negatively regulates the activity of mitogen activate protein kinase (MAPK) activity. A deficiency of this phosphatase leads to a prolonged and continual activation of the p38 MAP kinase and JNK MAP kinase. MAPK phosphatase 1 is the founding member of the family of MAPK phosphatases which is a group of 11 phosphatases. The N-terminus of MAPK phosphatase 1 is responsible for the localization of the nucleus. The p38 MAPK and JNK pathways are preferred to be dephosphorylated over the ERK pathway.

It has rough scaly or fibrous bark on the lower part of its trunk, smooth bark above, glossy, lance-shaped adult leaves, prominently corrugated flower buds arranged in groups of three in leaf axils and ribbed, conical to cup-shaped fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus corrugata is typically a tree that grows to a height of , sometimes a mallee, and forms a lignotuber. The bark on up to of the lower part of the trunk is rough, fibrous or flaky, dark brown to greyish. The bark on the upper part of the trunk and on the branches is smooth and grey over salmon pink. Leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are glaucous, long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, the same glossy green on both sides and lance-shaped to curved. They are long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to more or less spherical, long and wide with prominent corrugations along the side. The operculum is rounded or flattened, long. Flowering occurs between October and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with ribs along the sides and valves that extend well beyond the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus corrugata was first formally described by the botanist Johann George Luehmann in 1897 in The Victorian Naturalist, from a specimen collected from the Golden Valley near Bullfinch. The specific epithet (corrugata) is a Latin word meaning ‚Äúwrinkled‚Äù or \\"ridged\\", referring to the ribbed operculum of the buds. Distribution and habitat The rough-fruited mallee is distributed through the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Murchison biogeographic regions of Western Australia, especially between Westonia, Mount Jackson, Kalgoorlie and Marvel Loch.

The siege resulted in a Venetian victory and Lastovo became part of the Venetian Republic for a while.  Background  After the death of Croatian King Stjepan Dr≈æislav in 997, an ally of the Byzantine Empire, who ruled in the last three decades of the 10th century and was recognized by Byzantine emperor as the king of Croatia and Dalmatia, his eldest son and successor Svetoslav Suronja continued the pro- Byzantine policy, but his younger sons Kre≈°imir and Gojslav started to organize a rebellion. With the aid of Bulgarian emperor Samuil, Kre≈°imir and Gojslav managed to remove Svetoslav Suronja from the Croatian throne in 1000 and forced him to seek refuge in Venice. At the same time, Doge Pietro II Orseolo prepared Venetian forces to take control over Dalmatian cities that were part of the Byzantine Empire, Croatia, and Narentines. Since the maritime city populations were mostly Latin, the majority of cities welcomed the Venetian ruler, but some of them did not. In particular, the island of Lastovo fiercely resisted the Venetian incursion.  Siege  Before the siege, the island of Lastovo was part of the Theme of Dalmatia, ceded from the Byzantine Empire to the Kingdom of Croatia. The exact date of the siege of Lastovo is not known. According to John the Deacon, Orseolo's chronicler, the doge attended the Holy Mass on Ascension Day (9 May 1000) in Venice. Then he led his fleet towards Grado to visit the patriarch and on 11 May he sailed southwards. As the fleet reached Lastovo, the residents of the town did not welcome it, but waited behind the city walls, ready to resist. Orseolo ordered them to surrender but they refused, so he started to attack the town. His troops besieged it, trying to break the town gate as well as to seize the towers of the wall. They succeeded in capturing the tower with the water cistern, which was a big setback for the remaining defenders. Finally they were forced to surrender and to lay down their weapons. The doge spared their lives, but gave the order to his soldiers to destroy the defensive walls and to burn down the town. The citizens were moved away to the other side of the island, where they built a new settlement.  Aftermath  Pietro II Orseolo subjected Lastovo to Venetian authority. Then he moved further with his fleet towards Dubrovnik, whose dignitaries showed loyalty to him, and returned subsequently to Venice. He started to carry the title of Dux Dalmatianorum (Duke of the Dalmatians). For the next few decades, the island of Lastovo remained a Venetian possession. It came back and stayed under Croatian rule during the reign of King Stjepan I (ruled 1030-1058) and his successors. In 1252 the residents of Lastovo decided to join the Community of Dubrovnik (ital. Ragusa), (later Republic of Dubrovnik).

It is the largest library in Plymouth County and has been in operation since 1876.  History  The Carnegie building, former location of the Le Mars Public Library and listed on the NRHP. The library was created by a group of citizens on the evening of March 11, 1876. Their first meeting was held at the office of Mr. A. H. Lawrence, during which the Le Mars Library Association was formed. Several local women were elected to library association leadership positions. In the beginning, the library's collection was only available to those who purchased a membership. The library eventually eliminated memberships and began charging 10 cents per book, with a check-out period of 2 weeks. The library's collection of books was housed in various commercial buildings around town. For example, in April 1880, the library was moved to Tom Dodson's new store on upper Main Street. Discussion about transferring the library into the keeping of the city of Le Mars began in 1881. By 1885, the city had taken over the operation and support of the library, and the books were housed in rooms above the city offices. with The community approached the Carnegie Corporation of New York for a grant to build a library building, and its application was accepted on January 22, 1903. The total grant paid by the Carnegie Corporation was $12,000. John Werling designed the single-story Renaissance Revival building. The exterior walls are of pink-buff brick and the high basement walls are of rock-faced granite. The main entrance protrudes slightly from the main facade, and it is capped with triangular pediment. Within the tympanum are the initials \\"A.C.\\" for Andrew Carnegie. The Carnegie building was dedicated on January 1, 1904, and housed 3,885 books. It continued to serve the community until it was deemed too small. The old building was eventually rededicated as the Le Mars Civic Center and housed the Le Mars Arts Council and Le Mars Chamber of Commerce. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The chamber moved out in 1991, and the building is currently known as the Le Mars Arts Center. Upon outgrowing the Carnegie building, the library board began to investigate new locations. A former 7,600-square-foot Red Owl Supermarket building was proposed as a new home for the library. After some contention and a lengthy renovation, the new location was approved and the library moved in 1976. In 1986, a totem pole was presented to the library from the Le Mars Area Woodcarvers. It features mascots from the town's high schools, the Tonsfeldt round barn, a corn stalk, and more. In 2018, the totem pole was relocated to the Le Mars Art Center, the Carnegie building which formerly housed the library.

The new library features a special children's space, which includes The library reopened to the public on December 20, 2017.

McLernon was an American transportation executive who served as general manager of the New York City Transit Authority and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Lehigh Valley Railroad McLernon was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. He spent the first thirty years of his career with the Lehigh Valley Railroad. He began with the railroad in 19200 as a messenger and then served as a clerk, yardmaster, freight agent, and finally as the superintendent of all stations. In 1934 he organized and was elected president of the Lehigh Valley Railroad's first local of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks. New York City In 1955, McLernon became the general manager of the New York City Transit Authority. During his tenure, McLernon was able to eliminate the system's deficit. He also ordered the installation of automatic coin turnstiles in the New York City Subway. Boston In May 1960, McLernon was named general manager of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. He was given an 11-year contract and took office on July 1. During his tenure, McLernon battled the MTA's advisory board, the Massachusetts General Court, and the Carmen's Union, which went on strike twice during McLernon's time in office. On August 4, 1964 the MTA was taken over by the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. McLernon was chosen to manage the new system. On December 30, 1964, the MBTA board of directors elected to terminate McLernon. Director Robert P. Springer criticized McLernon for having \\"no concept that the job of management is not the job of a dictator\\", for mismanaging authority personnel, and for having a \\"vendetta with the Carmen's Union\\". He stated that the board chose to terminate McLernon after \\"his own subordinates disagreed with him and came to the board\\". McLernon in turn criticized the MTA/MBTA board for not giving him a \\"free hand to run the system\\", which prevented him from addressing the major problems besetting the MTA/MBTA. He also criticized the MBTA employees for being loyal to the Carmen's Union and not to \\"the organization that pays them\\". New Jersey After leaving Boston, McLernon moved to South Orange, New Jersey. He worked in the railroad division of the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the New Jersey State Department of Commutation. He retired in 1970 and that same year moved to Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey. Following his retirement, McLernon worked for many years as a transportation consultant. McLernon died on May 14, 1986 at his home in Spring Lake Heights. He was 80 years old.

Jelly-falls are marine carbon cycling events whereby gelatinous zooplankton, primarily cnidarians, sink to the seafloor and enhance carbon and nitrogen fluxes via rapidly sinking particulate organic matter. These events provide nutrition to benthic megafauna and bacteria. Jelly-falls have been implicated as a major ‚Äúgelatinous pathway‚Äù for the sequestration of labile biogenic carbon through the biological pump. These events are common in protected areas with high levels of primary production and water quality suitable to support cnidarian species. These areas include estuaries and several studies have been conducted in fjords of Norway. Initiation Jelly-falls are primarily made up of the decaying corpses of Cnidaria and Thaliacea (Pyrosomida, Doliolida, and Salpida). Several circumstances can trigger the death of gelatinous organisms which would cause them to sink. These include high levels of primary production that can clog the feeding apparatuses of the organisms, a sudden temperature change, when an old bloom runs out of food, when predators damage the bodies of the jellies, and parasitism. In general, however, jelly-falls are linked to jelly-blooms and primary production, with over 75% of the jelly falls in subpolar and temperate regions occurring after spring blooms, and over 25% of the jelly- falls in the tropics occurring after upwelling events. With global climates shifting towards creating warmer and more acidic oceans, conditions not favored by non-resilient species, jellies are likely to grow in population sizes. Eutrophic areas and dead zones can become jelly hot spots with substantial blooms. As the climate changes and ocean waters warm, jelly blooms become more prolific and the transport of jelly-carbon to the lower ocean increases. With a possible slowing of the classic biological pump, the transport of carbon and nutrients to the deep sea through jelly-falls may become more and more important to deep ocean. Decomposition The decomposition process starts after death and can proceed in the water column as the gelatinous organisms are sinking. Decay happens faster in the tropics than in temperate and subpolar waters as a result of warmer temperatures. In the tropics, a jelly-fall may take less than 2 days to decay in warmer, surface water, but as many as 25 days when it is lower than 1000m deep. However, lone gelatinous organisms may spend less time on the sea floor as one study found that jellies could be decomposed by scavengers in the Norwegian deep sea in under two and a half hours. Decomposition of jelly-falls is largely aided by these kinds of scavengers. In general, echinoderms, such as sea stars, have emerged as the primary consumer of jelly-falls, followed by crustaceans and fish. However, which scavengers find their way to jelly-falls is highly reliant on each ecosystem. For example, in an experiment in the Norwegian deep sea, hagfish were the first scavengers to find the traps of decaying jellies, followed by squat lobsters, and finally decapod shrimp. Photographs taken off the coast of Norway on natural jelly-falls also revealed caridean shrimp feeding on jelly carcasses. With increased populations and blooms becoming more common, with favorable conditions and a lack of other filter feeders in the area to consume plankton, environments with jellies present will have carbon pumps be more primarily supplied with jelly-falls. This could lead to issues of habitats with established biological pumps succumbing to nonequilibrium as the presence of jellies would change the food web as well as changes to the amount of carbon deposited into the sediment. Finally, decomposition is aided by the microbial community. In a case study on the Black Sea, the number of bacteria increased in the presence of jelly- falls, and the bacteria were shown to preferentially use nitrogen released from decaying jelly carcasses while mostly leaving carbon. In a study conducted by Andrew Sweetman in 2016, it was discovered using core samples of the sediment in Norwegian fjords, the presence of jelly-falls significantly impacted the biochemical process of these benthic communities. Bacteria consume jelly carcasses rapidly, removing opportunities of acquiring sustenance for bottoming feeding macrofauna, which has impacts traveling up the trophic levels. In addition, with the exclusion of scavengers, jelly-falls develop a white layer of bacteria over the decaying carcasses and emit a black residue over the surrounding area, which is from sulfide. This high level of microbial activity requires a lot of oxygen, which can lead zones around jelly-falls to become hypoxic and inhospitable to larger scavengers. Research challenges Researching jelly-falls relies on direct observational data such as video, photography, or benthic trawls. A complication with trawling for jelly-falls is the gelatinous carcass easily falls apart and as a result, opportunistic photography, videography, and chemical analysis have been primary methods of monitoring. This means that jelly-falls are not always observed in the time period in which they exist. Because jelly-falls can be fully processed and degraded within a number of hours by scavengers and the fact that some jelly-falls will not sink below 500m in tropical and subtropical waters, the importance and prevalence of jelly-falls may be underestimated.

History William Halling in 1776 The building was originally built in the 1730s. The property was in 1772 acquired by William von Halling who had just returned from India where he had been in British military service. He altered and expanded the building in 1773 - 1776. It is believed that the architect was Hans N√¶ss, a student of Nicolas-Henri Jardin. In 1774, he married Christine Linde Hvas de Lindenpalmm the only daughter of J√∏rgen Hvas de Lindenpalm. He received the two estates Tirsb√¶k and Bryckesborg as dowry, renaming the latter Willamsborg. In 1776, he ceded Tirsb√¶k to count Caspar von Moltke in exchange for Dronninglund in Vendsyssel.

Professional wrestling career=Early career Richard Charland became a wrestler with the encouragement by Mad Dog Vachon. The mat legend had met Charland, as a youngster, who was studying judo, and told him to consider professional wrestling as an option. Charland listened, and took up amateur wrestling for a few years before turning pro in 1972, at the young age of 16. He debuted in the Montreal-based Grand Prix Wrestling, and beat Pat Gerard Jr. in his first match. In 1974, he wrestled his first overseas tour for International Wrestling Enterprise in Japan, under the name The Tempest. In 1975, he would move to Toronto, to wrestle for Maple Leaf Wrestling. After a year in Toronto, he went to the United States in 1976, wrestling for The Sheik's Big Time Wrestling in Detroit, under the name Mauler Malone. He would remain in Detroit for nearly two years, before returning home to Montreal in 1977, and made a brief return to Detroit in 1979. Lutte Internationale (1980-1987) In 1980, Charland joined the upstart Lutte Internationale in Montreal. Soon after, he won his first title, the Canadian International Tag Team Championship, with Len Shelley. A year later, he and Shelley would lose the titles to Swede Hanson and Le Bourreau, but regained the titles the next year. However, their second reign wouldn't last as long as their first, as they lost the titles months later to Gino Brito and Rick McGraw. In 1984, Charland would return to Japan to wrestle for the shoot-style Universal Wrestling Federation. While there, he would wrestle the likes of Mach Hayato, Rusher Kimura, Ryuma Go, Kazuo Yamazaki, and Super Tiger. After a single tour, he returned home to Montreal. In May 1985, Charland won his third Canadian International Tag Team title, this time with King Tonga. However, his reign lasted over two weeks, before losing them to The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. In August 1985, he wrestled a World Wrestling Federation house show in Toronto, losing to Dino Bravo. In October 1986, he regained the Canadian International Tag Team title for the fourth time, this time with Sheik Ali. His reign would last nearly four months, before losing them to Armand Rougeau and Dan Kroffat. Two months later, he regained the titles for the fifth and final time, with Chuck Simms. He and Simms would be the final champions, as Lutte Internationale closed down in June 1987.  World Wrestling Federation (1988-1990)  From 1988 to mid 1990, Charland wrestled for the WWF as a jobber on Canadian and occasionally New York house shows. He made his only television appearance on the July 24, 1988, episode of Wrestling Challenge, losing to Terry Taylor. Later career In August 1990, he returned to Japan to wrestle a tour for All Japan Pro Wrestling, teaming with Eric Embry to take part in a tournament for the vacant All Asia Tag Team Championship, the team lost all four of their matches. On September 7, Charland lost to Haruka Eigen in his final match. Returning to the Montreal independent circuit, Charland adopted the moniker \\"Blast\\" in late 1991 in an attempt to resurrect the Demolition name and gimmick with Bill Eadie as Ax, but were eventually sent a cease and desist letter by the WWF. Charland also served as the french commentator with Marc Blondin for WCW for a time. After 1991, Charland began to cut back on his wrestling schedule, as he began working in construction, but still remained semi-active. In February 1994, he wrestled a WWF house show in Toronto, losing to Owen Hart. In July 1995, he wrestled a couple independent shows, wrestling Abdullah The Butcher. In April 1997, he wrestled a Montreal house show for World Championship Wrestling, teaming with Jacques Comptois in a loss to Martin and Serge Rolland. In 1999, Charland joined Jacques Rougeau's Lutte Internationale 2000, where he remained active until the promotion's closure in 2003.

It affects hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), or quahogs, both cultured and wild. Parasites similar to QPX were first observed in New Brunswick, Canada, in 1959, when a mass death of hard clams was observed. Outbreaks have also occurred in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia, always only in quahog clams. Symptoms of QPX include chipping of the shells, mantle swelling, stunted shell growth and the development of nodules.  Biology  The life stages of thalli, endospores, and sporangia have been observed. It somewhat resembles the unrelated protist haplosporidian parasite Haplosporidium nelsoni (MPX), a pathogen of the eastern oyster.'' QPX was originally considered a chytrid, but has now been provisionally assigned to the phylum Labyrinthulomycota in either the families Thraustochytriidae or Labyrinthulidae, based on the organism having a \\"uninucleate biflagellate zoospore stage, a loose multilaminar cell wall, and particularly an intracellular sagenogen-like structure\\". However, much about it is still unknown. QPX-like organisms also may not be all of the same species. Molecular phylogenetic on the SSU rRNA of QPX was able to produce the same phylum-level identification, and more precisely down to the family Thraustochytriidae next to Thraustochytrium pachydermum. A PCR primer targeting this region that detects QPX infection has been constructed. QPX can be cultured in laboratories, with the optimal temperature being 20 to 23 ¬∞C. It produces a mucus that causes inflammation in the clam and shields itself from clam immune response.  Control and epidemiology  Genetics  The partial genome of QPX has been sequenced by the shotgun method in 2013, along with the transcriptome to identify genes important in stress response (mainly temperature). A few interesting proteins and a wide range of genetic polymorphisms have been identified. It expresses some genes involved in the synthesis of antibiotics that are also toxic to clams. Further experimental characterisation in 2018 of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms shows variations in genes related to virulence and environmental (salinity and temperature) adaptation.

PB is not a single disease with a defined mechanism that explains the cast formation in all conditions. Examples of diseases associated with expectoration of casts, and which sometimes are labeled PB include tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and asthma. When casts are very large with many branches, an abnormal communication or leakage of lymphatic fluid into the airway is often the cause. This entity is termed lymphatic plastic bronchitis (LPB). LPB is a lymphatic flow disorder characterized by the recurrent formation of branching, rubbery bronchial casts composed primarily of proteinaceous and sometimes chylous material and lymphocytes. Lymphatic fluids deposited into the airspaces become gelatinous as they cool, forming large string cheese-like casts of the airways, which can obstruct airflow. Attempts to expectorate casts can be quite frightening, leading to fears of asphyxiation.  Signs and symptoms  The clinical presentation of plastic bronchitis beyond expectoration of casts includes a productive cough, dyspnea, fever and wheezing. Focal wheezing is a characteristic, if not specific, physical examination finding. If the casts completely obstruct the airway, breath sounds will be decreased and dullness will be present with percussion. With partial obstruction, a ‚Äúfan sound‚Äù or ‚Äúflag flapping‚Äù sound can be heard during auscultation. Bronchial casts can sometimes fill the airways of almost an entire lung, and present as an acute, life-threatening emergency.  Pathology  The majority of PB cases are associated with an underlying disease. Several systemic illnesses have been associated with plastic bronchitis: * Cardiac: constrictive pericarditis, congenital heart disease * Pulmonary: asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergillosis, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and bronchocentric granulomatosis * Disorders of lymphatic drainage: lymphangiectasia, lymphangiomatosis * Miscellaneous: acute chest syndrome/sickle cell disease, amyloidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, membranous colitis, inhaled irritants, neoplastic (lymphoma) The most common form of plastic bronchitis follows cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease, especially the Fontan procedure. Systemic blood flow is diverted to pulmonary flow, elevating pressures in the pulmonary venous system, and promoting leaks of proteinaceous and lipid-rich fluids from the lymphatics into the bronchial tree.  Diagnosis  Plastic bronchitis cast The diagnosis of plastic bronchitis is confirmed by recovery of casts that have been coughed up or visualized during a bronchoscopy. There is no specific cytologic, pathologic or laboratory test that is diagnostic for casts due to lymphatic PB.  Imaging  Simple chest x-rays may reveal collapse due to airway obstruction. The contralateral lung may be hyperinflated. Casts can be visualized within the major airways using computerized axial tomography scans. Heavy T2-weighted MRI, and, as appropriate, intranodal lymphangiogram and/or dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography may be useful for identifying pathological lymphatic tissue or lymphatic flow.  Management  Acute therapy for PB is often focused on removal or facilitated expectoration of the casts. This is followed by short and long term efforts to identify and remediate the underlying condition resulting in the excessive airway leakage or inflammation that is causing the casts to form. PB can present as a life threatening emergency when the casts obstruct the major airways resulting in acute respiratory distress. Intervention by a skilled physician experienced with foreign body removal from the lungs is essential. Evaluation by means of bronchoscopy can be difficult and time consuming and is best performed under general anesthesia. Casts can be removed mechanically by bronchoscopy or physical therapy. High-frequency chest wall oscillation can also be used to vibrate the chest wall at a high frequency to try to loosen and thin the casts. Inhaled therapy using bronchodilators, corticosteroids or mucolytics can be used to try to disrupt the cast formation. Guaifenesin syrup or tablets can assist in loosening existing casts for expectoration. Recently, heavy T2-weighted MRI has revealed that occult lymphatic anomalies that represent developmental remnants or subclinical GLA are present in adults who present with expectoration of large multiantennary, branching casts. Intranodal lymphangiogram and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography have been used to more precisely image the leaks, and in the small number of patients who have been treated to date, embolization of the thoracic duct has been highly successful in controlling cast formation. Cannulation of the thoracic duct followed by embolization should be considered in those patients who are shown to have leakage of lymphatic fluid into the airway. Medications Therapeutic interventions with medium-chain triglyceride-enriched low-fat diets, intratracheal heparin, inhaled tissue plasminogen activator, and steroids have also been reported and have met with variable success. Expectorants such as guaifenesin increase thinner secretions and lubricate the airways, allowing loosening and possible self-expulsion of casts. Inhaled mucolytics: Potassium iodide and acetylcysteine inhaled therapy are often used to help the patient cough up the casts by breaking down the thick mucus formations. Inhaled and oral steroids: If PB is associated with asthma or an infection, inhaled and oral steroids have been shown to be effective.  Prognosis  Patients with plastic bronchitis that is being caused due to a co-morbid condition generally have a good prognosis once the underlying disease is treated.  Epidemiology  To date, about 420 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Given its unusual nature, the true prevalence of PB is unknown, and it is likely that many patients are undiagnosed. PB does affect patients of all age groups and both genders.

She goes to a magic school and summons a ghost that steals her spellbook. Momo fights ghosts and bosses throughout five levels, taking place in the school's library, a cafeteria, a classroom, a gymnasium, and on the rooftop. Ghosts are defeated by clicking and swiping the mouse in certain directions, pertaining to the symbol atop the ghosts' heads. The swiping directions include an horizontal line, a vertical line, a \\"v\\" shape, a \\" å\\" shape, and a lightning bolt, the latter-most of which summons lightning that destroys onscreen enemies. On occasion, the player will be allowed to swipe in a heart-like shape to regain health. Development The creation of the game was coordinated amongst four different design groups, relating to art design, engineering, production, and music. The original concept for the game involved Momo making soup that resurrects dead spirits. The game's development involved many rejected concepts and ideas, including elaborate symbols to draw (such as a \\"Cat Hat\\" spell), as well as boss enemies like a chef ghost and a Venn diagram ghost.

Basketball is played year-round by men and women and various levels of competition. Several professional basketball leagues have teams based in Canada. History James Naismith, a Canadian who moved to the United States, invented basketball in Springfield, Massachusetts in the 1890s. This new sport soon became popular as an indoor sport that needed a minimal equipment, gaining popularity at high schools and colleges in Canada. The Toronto Huskies were co-founders of the Basketball Association of America, a forerunner of the NBA, but disbanded after the first season. In Canada, the sport has long lived in the shadow of ice hockey, but in the early 21st century the sport saw a rise in popularity, partly due to the Toronto Raptors, an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise established in 1995. The Vancouver Grizzlies was another NBA expansion franchise that was based in Vancouver, British Columbia from 1995 to 2001, when it was relocated to Memphis, Tennessee. The National Basketball League was played for one and a half seasons in 1993 and 1994. In 2011, a new domestic league was formed, the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada), with the London Lightning won its first two national titles. NBL Canada presently operate 10 franchises throughout Canada. The league was the first fully domestic professional basketball league to operate in Canada since the National Basketball League, which operated from 1993 to 1994. The Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL) is a professional tier 1 basketball league which began play in 2019 season. The Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship in 2019, the first champion outside of the United States. Collegiate basketball Students in Canada may participate in varsity basketball teams in colleges and universities throughout Canada. U Sports is the national sports governing body for university sports in Canada, whereas the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association is the national governing body for colleges. The winners of U Sports' annual men's basketball championship are awarded the W. P. McGee Trophy, whereas the winners of the women's annual basketball championship are awarded the Bronze Baby trophy. There is also a growing number of both Canadian men and women playing in the United States' National Collegiate Athletic Association. Professional basketball The Toronto Raptors play the Milwaukee Bucks at Scotiabank Arena. The Raptors is the National Basketball Association's only team based in Canada. Presently, only one team in the NBA is based in Canada, the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors also operate a minor league professional team, the Raptors 905 of the NBA G League. Both Raptors franchises are based in the Greater Toronto Area. In addition to the NBA, there are three other professional basketball leagues which have a team based in Canada, the National Basketball League of Canada, Canadian Elite Basketball League, and the American Basketball Association. However, a number of Canadians play in the NBA including Andrew Wiggins, Cory Joseph, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, Jamal Murray, Kelly Olynyk, Nik Stauskas, Tristan Thompson, and Trey Lyles. In addition, four Canadians are playing in the Women's National Basketball Association including Adut Bulgak, Kayla Alexander, Kia Nurse, and Natalie Achonwa. Canadian collegiate athletes playing basketball may choose to play professionally overseas after university or college. In addition, there are several Canadians playing professionally for various professional basketball organizations throughout North America. The most prominent player is Steve Nash, 2-time NBA Most Valuable Player and 2-time FIBA AmeriCup Most Valuable Player. Notable Canadians in the Women's National Basketball Association include Tammy Sutton-Brown, Kayla Alexander, Stacey Dales, Natalie Achonwa and Adut Bulgak. National competition Canada has competed in a number of international competitions contested by national teams, most notably the Summer Olympics, and tournaments organized by FIBA, including the Basketball World Cup, and the Women's Basketball World Cup. The Canadian men's national basketball team has made nine appearances at the Summer Olympic basketball tournament, winning silver at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The men's national team has also made 13 appearances to the FIBA World Cup. The Canadian women's national basketball team have made six appearances to the Summer Olympics, and 10 to the Women's World Cup. The women's national team won bronze in the 1979 and 1986 Women's World Cup tournaments. In addition to the national team, Canada Basketball also manages a number of youth teams, including the women's under-17, men's under-17, women's under-19, and the men's under-19 teams.

The user must log into that IP telephone with a username and PIN. Once logged in, the phone has the user's profile information, including their extension number (the reason for calling it ‚Äòextension mobility‚Äô), dial permissions and other feature settings (e.g. call forwards). Extension mobility is often by people who frequently travel between different company locations. They can use any fixed-line phone in the company as if it is their own telephone by logging in. Extension Mobility is also useful in situations where people don‚Äôt have a dedicated desk of their own. In a flex-office where people just enter and pick a desk, they can easily register on that desktop phone and use it as theirs. It is convenient since people can use their own features, but also it makes people reachable. The number of missed calls will be minimal.  The Login Complexity  There are a few issues with the use of extension mobility. One must to log into the telephone via the telephone keypad. However, if the username is easy and the PIN is short, this may not be the biggest problem. However, in organizations that use services such as Active Directory (where the username is shared across multiple applications), the user must enter their email address via the telephone keypad.  Login Alternatives  In general, this login issue sometimes results in suboptimal usage, such as when people ‚Äòforget‚Äô to log in or log out. The consequence is that they are either not reachable, or that a telephone can be used unauthorized after the employee leaves his desk. One option that users have is the possibility to configure the so-called one-click login. Certain user profiles are pre-configured for certain telephones and the user can simply select their profile using a single button. This provides a solution in small teams where people require the flexibility to use their own profile but can completely trust each other. However, in other situations a software solution like the Active Login Manager may be the solution. Using this client software, the login procedure for the telephone is synchronized with the login of a user's laptop or PC. Whenever the user opens their laptop, the telephone on that same desk is automatically logged in.

She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Bellechasse had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. Bellechasse was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. This was later replaced with a 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun.Macpherson, p. 19 For anti- aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. The 2-pounder gun was later replaced with a powered twin 20 mm Oerlikon mount. As a convoy escort, Bellechasse was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1939‚Äì40 building programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 16 April 1941 by Burrard Dry Dock at their yard in Vancouver, British Columbia. Named for a county in Quebec, Bellechasse was launched on 20 October 1941 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 13 December 1941.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 168 Bellechasse spent the entirety of the Second World War on the West Coast of Canada. Assigned to the patrol units Esquimalt Force (operating out of Esquimalt, British Columbia) or Prince Rupert Force (operating out of Prince Rupert, British Columbia), the main duty of Bangor-class minesweepers after commissioning on the West Coast was to perform the Western Patrol. This consisted of patrolling the west coast of Vancouver Island, inspecting inlets and sounds and past the Scott Islands to Gordon Channel at the entrance to the Queen Charlotte Strait and back.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, p. 349 Following the end of the war, Bellechasse was paid off on 23 October 1945 at Esquimalt.

The facility held up to 32 high-risk youths at a time who were serving sentences for crimes such as assault, robbery, forcible confinement, escape, and weapons charges. Youth serving sentences for crimes such as murder, arson, and sexual assault were not eligible for admission to Project Turnaround. History Project Turnaround operated on a boot camp approach, part of a tough on crime response to increasing youth incarceration rates by the government of Premier Mike Harris. Solicitor General Bob Runciman stated that Project Turnaround was \\"about getting people up at six o'clock in the morning [and] reducing the kind of privileges [young offenders] have currently across the system.\\" Harris' campaign in the 1995 provincial election explicitly used the term \\"boot camps\\" to refer to plans for strict youth detention facilities, but the provincial government and Encourage Youth Corporation both later objected to that label being applied to Project Turnaround. Youth held in the facility were subjected to high-intensity daily activities that lasted approximately 16 hours under a program of military- style discipline. The program‚Äîdesigned to be \\"more than a boot camp\\" according to Project Turnaround owner Sally Walker in a 2003 interview‚Äî was meant to instill respect and accountability, build productive skills, and offer educational and vocational programming to those who were predicted to re- offend. The provincial government touted the program as a success, reporting that the rate of recidivism among youth who had been through Project Turnaround was 33 percent compared to 50 percent at public youth centres, and Public Security Minister Bob Runciman announced a plan in 2003 to expand the strict-discipline youth detention model across the province. Other researchers, such as University of Toronto criminologist Anthony Doob, stated those claims were not shown by the government's own data and that youths passing through Project Turnaround were not any less likely to re-offend. On February 2003 the establishment had a mould outbreak. Following the change of government in the 2003 provincial election, new Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services Monte Kwinter announced that the contract for Project Turnaround would not be renewed. Kwinter cited the high cost and small population of the program as the reason for the decision and stated that youth correctional services would be better provided through government-run programs. In a December 2003 interview, Walker disagreed that the program did not provide value for money and claimed that Project Turnaround was under- capacity due to judges being more lenient on youth following changes to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. All youth at Project Turnaround were relocated to public youth detention centres on December 5, 2004 and the facility was formally closed on January 31, 2004. In January 2005, several missing children cases were filed, and extensive search were held in the facilities around Project Turnaround due to its closure.

The term does not replace any individual diagnoses or disorders, but rather describes a category of mental health concerns linked to the particular challenges that these military members or first responders encounter in their service. There is not yet a single fixed definition. The term was first conceptualized within the Canadian Armed Forces to help foster understanding of the broader mental health challenges faced by military members who have been impacted by traumatic experiences and who face difficulty as a result. OSI encompasses a number of the diagnoses found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classification system, with the common thread being a linkage to the operational experiences of the afflicted. The term has gained traction outside of the military community as an appropriate way to describe similar challenges suffered by those whose work regularly exposes them to trauma, particularly front line emergency first responders such as but not limited to police, firefighters, paramedics, correctional officers, and emergency dispatchers. The term, at present mostly used within Canada, is increasingly significant in the development of legislation, policy, treatments and benefits in the military and first responder communities. History Military members experiencing wartime trauma may suffer debilitating psychological effects from their experiences, and historical research has found literary references to these psychological packs throughout recorded history. During the First World War era, psychological symptoms suffered by soldiers in war came to be referred to as \\"shell shock\\". This progressed by the Second World War to being called \\"battle fatigue\\", or \\"combat stress reaction\\". As research continued and the understanding of psychology and psychiatry advanced, it gradually became more understood through the 20th century that experiencing trauma could have a variety of psychological and emotional impacts that were genuinely medical in nature. Increasingly, research focused on developing clinical definitions and exploring options for treatments and therapies. The term 'posttraumatic stress disorder' (PTSD), was developed for inclusion in the DSM-III in the 1980s. While not a condition limited to those who had experienced wartime trauma, PTSD is often associated with soldiers returning from wartime. In 2001, Canadian Forces Lieutenant Colonel St√©phane Grenier coined the term 'Operational stress injury' to describe a mental or emotional injury suffered by soldiers in the course of their service. The term was designed to expand the understanding of mental health disorders related to service beyond just PTSD, and to include other clinical diagnoses linked to trauma. The word 'injury' was chosen to help shift the view of these disorders in order to extend to them the same legitimacy in discourse as physical injuries, and to help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health. Not a diagnosis itself, operational stress injury was described by the Canadian Forces as a ‚Äúgrouping of diagnoses that are related to injuries that occur as part of operations\\", most commonly PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety. By 2016, the Canadian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security recognized OSIs as an issue faced by all first responder organizations, not just the military. As of late 2016, the Parliament of Canada is exploring a national strategy to address OSIs within the various public safety professions. The term does not as of yet have any regular use outside of Canada. Commonly included diagnoses The concept of operational stress injury is still emerging and evolving, and does not as of yet have a commonly accepted fixed definition. Research within the Canadian military has nonetheless identified several disorders most commonly associated with traumatic service-related experiences, and which have generally been accepted as included in the term. The same psychiatric conditions are the subject of considerable study and public policy discussion among the first responder professions. Two or more of these diagnoses may be comorbid, and comorbidity may also exist with physical injuries or illnesses. Posttraumatic stress disorder Posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is among the most common individual diagnoses linked to traumatic exposure in military or first responder service. PTSD is related to anxiety disorders, and is linked to the intrusive and unwanted re-experiencing of traumatic events. Those suffering from PTSD will often seek to avoid and may be triggered by stimuli that cause recollection of their traumatic exposures. Symptoms may include inability to sleep, anger, irritability, fear, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. A study of over 30,000 Canadian soldiers following deployments to Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia found 8.9% of the study cohort to be suffering from PTSD after an average follow-up period of nearly four years. Depression Depression refers, generally, to major depressive disorder or related mood disorders. Depression is widely believed to be the most prevalent mental health diagnosis faced by military members and first responders, accounting for a significant portion of those who are unable to work fully or at all due to mental health reasons. Research within the Canadian Armed Forces has found that at least 8% of full-time members of the Canadian Military exhibit symptoms of major depression. Anxiety disorders Anxiety disorders, including general anxiety disorder, acute stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and other related diagnoses are also frequently found in the military and first response community. While PTSD falls under the larger category of anxiety disorders, it is often considered distinctly due to its greater prevalence than other anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders frequently manifest in the form of debilitating stress and anxiety experienced by a victim in the presence or anticipation of triggering stimuli. Anxiety may be disabling in that it may render someone incapable of coping well or at all with a situation that would normally be within their capabilities absent the clinical anxiety. Military research has found anxiety disorders to be more prevalent in those who had deployed to active conflicts. When PTSD is totalled with other anxiety disorders, this category of mental health diagnosis is the most prevalent among Canadian military personnel with deployments Adjustment disorder A lesser known but not uncommon diagnosis among military personnel, adjustment disorder (sometimes referred to as situational depression) is characterized by an individual's inability to adjust to external stressors, or major life events. Although presentation will vary, it may include a combination of depressive, anxious, or post-traumatic stress symptoms that do not meet the clinical threshold for those related named disorders. Adjustment disorder often abates once a person is able to adapt to new circumstances. Military members and first responders may potentially face significant life changes in their careers, including geographic relocations, exposure to very different cultural norms, and potentially the life changing impact of injury or illness and the inability to continue with their career. Substance-related disorder Substance-related disorder, or the abuse of alcohol or drugs, may also be included in the operational stress injury umbrella. The various psychological effects of different substances, particularly the depressive effects of excess alcohol consumption, often serve as a form of 'self medication' for those dealing with other stressors or traumas. Alcohol or drug addictions can often mask or complicate the treatment of symptoms of other disorders, and may need to be addressed before treatment for underlying disorders can be effective. Suicide There is a well established link between operational stress injury symptoms, and a heightened risk of suicide. While suicide and suicidality data for military and public safety professions is not comprehensive, these professions are not exceptions to established links between the various mental health disorders and a greater risk of death by suicide. Treatment  The various disorders that are broadly called 'operational stress injuries' each have their own bodies of research into various treatments and therapies. Most treatments can either be considered pharmacological, such as antidepressant or antianxiety medication, or psychosocial therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. For many patients a combined approach is used, with medications helping to stabilize moods and symptoms while behavioural therapy helps to address underlying memories, cognitions, situation appraisals, and other thinking patterns. The military and public safety professions vary widely among differing jurisdictions as to what is available in terms of therapy. Military members in western nations typically are covered to some extent by their respective military health services, or by governmental departments dedicated to providing services to veterans, such as Veterans Affairs Canada or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Police, firefighters, paramedics, and other related professions will each have differing health care arrangements and benefits depending on the health services an insurance arrangements in their respective country, state, province, territory, or municipality. In addition to formal healthcare settings, numerous grassroots or state-funded peer support organizations have emerged. Many of these organizations help affected veterans or first responders to connect with each other in physical or virtual peer support settings. Increasingly these organizations have played a role in crisis intervention, suicide prevention, and ongoing support. While informal peer support efforts do not substitute for proper clinical care, they help some affected personnel to begin accepting that they are suffering from traumatic or other stress linked to their occupations, and to begin accessing clinical resources.

The Bathing Women focuses on the lives and personal growth of several characters as they live in the turbulent times of The Cultural Revolution and the economic boom of the 1980s. The plot focuses on several feminist themes such as gender inequality, misogyny and sexual liberality.  Plot summary  The Bathing Women focuses on the main character Tiao, a Beijing publisher who on chance begins an affair with the older married actor Feng Jing, her sister Fan and her long term friend Fei, as they grow up in the chaos of The Cultural Revolution. The novel is set simultaneously in the 1960s and 1980s China. The novel confronts the themes of misogyny, gender roles and double standards of Chinese culture. The novel opens with the protagonist Tiao, a successful executive for a Beijing publishing company, entering into an affair with the married actor Feng Jing. Feng Jing is internationally acclaimed for his portrayal of the hardships of the victims of the Cultural Revolution based on his own experiences in a labor camp at the time. Throughout their relationship Feng Jing promises Tiao that he will leave his wife to marry her. The setting of the novel flashes back to a moment in Tiao's youth, in which she witnesses the public denouncement of one of her school's teachers, Tang Jingjing. Ms. Tang had recently had a daughter out of wedlock and is labelled as a \\"female hooligan\\". As punishment for her transgression she is given a choice: either reveal the name of the father of her daughter or be forced to consume feces, Ms. Tang not wanting to humiliate her daughter, chooses the latter. Chapter 2 of The Bathing Women focuses on Tiao and her sister Fan's early childhood, in particular their relationship to their father Yixun and their mother Wu. Yixun, a successful architect is denounced as a class enemy and sent to the labor camp Reed River Farm to be \\"reeducated through labor.\\" During this time Wu develops an illness in which she suddenly becomes dizzy and collapses, which allows her a brief period of leave from the camp to return to her family. Wu, frightened by the idea of returning to the camp seduces her physician Doctor Tang, who reciprocates by turning in a false diagnosis to the government that Wu suffers from a chronic heart condition, thus allowing her to be spared from returning. Despite returning to her children, Wu routinely ignores them in favor of pursuing her relationship with Dr. Tang, enraging Tiao who sees her mother as betraying her father. The tension between mother and daughter reaches a climax as Fan develops a serious illness while her mother is visiting her lover, leading to Tiao to scream at her mother, claiming that Fan's illness is entirely the fault of her mother. Tiao befriends Dr. Tang's niece, Fei, an attractive and luxuriously dressed high school girl. Despite Tiao's animosity to Dr. Tang for having an affair with her mother, Tiao soon finds Fei to be her closest friend, often spending hours with her and Youyou, reading prohibited Soviet magazines for recipes. During this time Wu becomes pregnant with her third daughter Quan, the pregnancy is immediately regarded with suspicion by all members of the family, who believe that Dr. Tang had fathered the child not Yiuan. Quan is routinely mistreated by both Fan and Tiao who view her as an example of their mother's infidelity. While the sisters watch Quan play in the street one day, they witness her fall into an open sewer, dying instantly. This moment would act as a strong motivator for both Fan and Tiao who feel as though they had both murdered their mistreated sister. Characters *Tiao ‚Äì Central character of the novel. Born in the city of Fu'an, Fei grows up during The Cultural Revolution. Later she is introduced as literary agent for a large Chinese book publishing company that specializes in memoirs of Chinese celebrities. * Fan ‚Äì Tiao's younger sister.

Throughout her life Fei enters into several abusive relationships. *Youyou ‚Äì Friend of Tiao's and Fei's. An amateur chef, Youyou takes pride in cooking new recipes she learns from prohibited Russian magazines.

Feng is extremely callous manipulating Tiao with a promise to marry her once he divorces his present wife.  Reception  The Bathing Women generally received mixed to positive reviews from Western critics. Julia Lovell of The Guardian wrote, \\"...compared with recent offerings by writers such as Mo Yan or Yu Hua, Tie Ning's command of psychological realism is practically Jamesian. Her portrait of the conceited Fang Jing is agreeably sharp. She is an acute, sympathetic observer of Chinese society, skilled at capturing the discomforts, hypocrisies and uncouthness of everyday life, and the way that guilt and grievance corrode relationships.\\" Though Lovell also notes that she considers the book to be conforming with the historical interpretation of China as established by the Chinese Communist Party. Japanese Nobel Prize laureate Kenzaburo Oe praised the novel stating,\\"If I were to pick the ten best literary works in the world of the past ten years, I would definitely rank The Bathing Women among them.\\" In contrast, DAWN contributor Zara Khadeeja Majoka gave a far more negative review of the book stating, \\"On the whole, the reader is neither able to muster any great empathy for the characters nor relate to them in any significant way. The novel is cluttered with many ‚Äòalmost‚Äô moments; moments when you almost feel something for a character or almost understand their motive but then soon enough an unnecessary tangent, a gross magnification of the obvious or a dreaded clich√© rears its head and you're back to feeling frustrated.\\"  References  Category:Fiction set in 2000 Category:Books about Maoist China Category:Chinese historical novels Category:Novels set in the 1960s Category:2000 novels Category:Books about the Cultural Revolution Category:Feminist novels Category:Novels about communism Category:Novels set in the 1990s Category:Novels set in China Category:Novels by Tie Ning Category:Chinese novels adapted into television series Category:20th-century Chinese novels Category:Novels about misogyny ","title":"The Bathing Women"},{"id":"52145035","text":"The Black Diamonds were an Australian garage rock and band from Lithgow, New South Wales, who were active under different names from 1959 to 1971. They became one of the most popular groups in their region of New South Wales and signed with Festival Records, where they recorded two singles. They have particularly become regarded for the song \\"I Want, Need, Love You\\" which appeared on the B-side of their first single. It featured a desperate vocal over a pounding rhythm section, along with Alan Oloman's fast guitar breaks, and became a regional hit. The band toured with several top name acts such as the Easybeats. In 1967, their second single became a hit in the Sydney area. In 1968 the group changed their name to Tymepiece and evolved into a more eclectic and progressive act, releasing a version of the Tokens' \\"Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" and an album, Sweet Release, in 1971. They broke up later that year. History=Origins The band that eventually became the Black Diamonds was founded in Lithgow, a mining town in New South Wales. In 1959, Alan Stuart Oloman and Allen Michael Keogh, who were both twelve year's old, learned to play guitar from a friend, Brandt Newton, who was a couple of years older. The three started playing together regularly, doing primarily instrumentals. They found a drummer, Johnny Kett, but had no bassist at this point. Alan Oloman's father, Bill Oloman, became the group's manager and provided space at his family house for the band to rehearse. He came up with the name for the band, \\"Johnny Kett's Black Diamonds\\", as a reference to the mining industry in their home town and drummer Kett, who at the time was their leader. The group started playing live gigs, and got a Saturday night residency at Scottish Reunion Dance, a local dancehall. In 1963, Brandt Newton departed and Alan Oloman's brother, Neil Oloman joined on guitar, while Allen Keogh switched over to bass, filling out their sound, which now largely consisted of surf instrumentals. With the onslaught of the Beatles and the British Invasion in 1964, they recognised that they would need a lead vocalist, and chose Glen Christopher to fill the role. Glen Bland joined the group on rhythm guitar, allowing Alan Oloman to concentrate on his lead parts. The group's leadership role shifted from drummer Kett to Alan Oloman, whose increasingly virtuosic lead guitar playing was emerging as a key feature in the band's sound. Christopher later departed and Bland took over on lead vocals (and harmonica). Recording and touring 1965‚Äì1966 In 1965, Kett departed and was replaced by Colin McAuley a brilliant drummer whose flair complemented Oloman's leads. At this time, the group shortened their name to \\"the Black Diamonds\\" and had become the biggest band in the New Mountains area. Record companies eventually started expressing interest. Alan Oloman was working as a part-time announcer at the local radio station 2LT, where he got to know programming director Bob Jolly, who arranged for the group to record demos in the radio station's broadcasting studio, and sent them to various record labels, such as Festival Records's Pat Aulton, who were particularly impressed with the demo, \\"See the Way\\", written by Alan Oloman, and arranged to have the group re-record it for the release of a single. \\"See the Way\\" was the A-side, and it was characterised by Alan Oloman's \\"spacey\\" sounding guitar parts, which were put through an ape delay to get the effect. Even more striking was the B-Side, for which the group had originally intended to record a cover of a Rolling Stones song. But, when producer Pat Aulton heard the band members practising a riff, he recommended that they build a song around it, which resulted in \\"I Want, Need, Love You\\", an intense and groundbreaking slab of hard rock and proto- punk, that featured an overdriven instrumental interlude replete with pounding jungle rhythms and a lightning-fast guitar solo by Alan Oloman. The single was released in November 1966. Though it failed to break the national charts, it became a huge hit around Lithgow and much of New South Wales. It went to No. 15 at station 2BS in Bathurst. The Black Diamonds, who now had up to thirty original songs in their repertoire as well as covers, became an opening act on tours for big-name acts such as the Easybeats, who were Australia's most popular group, several of whose members have mentioned the Black Diamonds as the best opening band they ever shared the bill with. They appeared on ABC's Be My Guest television programme, where they appeared in two featurette segments showing the band members lip-synching to \\"See the Way\\" and \\"I Want, Need, Love You\\" while standing on a rocky beach. The also appeared on Saturday Date programme. The group encountered difficulties typical of 1960s rock groups. Live shows could be gruelling‚Äîat certain gigs the band was expected to play for up to four hours, late into the night, promoters and club owners ripped the band off on several occasions, and once while on tour they got into a scuffle with reactionary hoodlums. According to vocalist Glen Bland: :On one occasion we did a show at a civic centre in St Mary's, a western suburb of Sydney, where a gang of hoods turned up. They saw our long hair and fancy clothes, so they stood outside until the show finished and the security had gone home and yelled from outside the hall for us to come out so they could give us a beating. Neil got fed up with this, and walked through the middle of mob to his car and opened the trunk, whereupon he produced a .303 rifle which had been left from a hunting expedition he had made a few days earlier. The hoods quickly scattered. 1967 and beyond Their second single was released in March 1967. Pat Aulton selected J. J. Cale's \\"Outside Looking In\\" for the A-side, a decision that the band members felt was a mistake. The B-side was the Who-influenced power pop of \\"Not This Time\\", which found band more in their element. For \\"Not This Time\\" Alan Oloman played a homemade 12-string guitar. The single made the top 30 in Sydney, but failed to break nationally. Later that year, rhythm guitarist Niel Oloman departed and was replaced not with a guitarist but a keyboard player, Brian \\"Felix\\" Wilkinson. At the end of the year the band moved their base of operations to Sydney. When they got there, they secured residencies at the Caesar's Palace and Hawaiian Eye discoth√®ques. In 1968, bassist Alan Keogh departed and was replaced by Darcy Rosser. At the urging of Pat Aulton and Festival Records, they changed their name to Tymepiece, and they signed an extended contract to record under the new name. As Tymepiece, they recorded three singles featuring songs such as \\"Bird in the Tree\\" and a version of the Tokens' \\"Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". In 1971 they released the album, Sweet Release, which featured an eclectic blend of psychedelic, progressive, blues, and country influences. Later that year the band broke up. In 1973, Alan Oloman joined the Executives. In he died of cancer at the age of 61. Legacy In recent years the Black Diamonds' work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts around the world. Songs such as \\"I Want, Need, Love You\\", \\"See the Way\\" have appeared on various vinyl and CD anthologies. \\"I Want, Need, Love You\\" was included on the Down Under Nuggets: Original Australian Artyfacts 1965‚Äì1967 compilation issued by Festival Records in conjunction with Warner Bros. Records and Rhino Records. \\"See the Way\\" was included on the Obscure 60s Garage, Volume 5: Australian Edition compilation. The Black Diamonds have become recognised as a trailblazing and innovative group. According to music writer Ian McFarlane, \\"the Black Diamonds will be remembered as one of the most ferocious garage punk outfits Australia ever produced in the 1960s\\".

He fought at the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74, the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-92, the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792 as well as the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. Career Nikolay Arsenyev was born around 1739, but according to Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze, the exact date of his birth is unclear. He started his military career in 1760, when he enlisted into the Preobrazhensky Regiment, one of the oldest guard/elite regiments of the Imperial Russian Army. Several years later, he would fight his first war, namely the Russo- Turkish War of 1768-74, and engaged at the battles of Kafa (1771) and Obashtu (1773). In 1780, he was promoted to colonel (polkovnik), seven years later, in 1778, to brigadier, and lastly on 16 February 1790 to major general. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74, he participated in the siege of Izmail, and fought at Tulcea as well. For his deeds at the successful siege of Izmail, he was awarded the Order of Saint George (3rd class) on 5 April 1791. Soon after, he was moved to participate in the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792 and the relatively shortly ensuing Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, led by Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. In these two years in Poland (1792-1794), Arsenyev fought at several battles, namely those at Nesvizh, Slutsk, as well as Brest-Litovsk. For his deeds at this front, he received the Order of Saint Vladimir (2nd class). However, on 20 April 1794, he was captured by the Poles.

It was formed in June 1916 with the role of preparing soldiers for combat with the AIF's infantry battalions. From September that year until the battalion's disbandment in October 1917 it was used as a tunnelling unit. History The 1st Anzac Entrenching Battalion was formed at La Motte in France on 6 June 1916. Like the other British Empire entrenching battalions, the unit was initially used to hold reinforcement infantrymen for I ANZAC Corps. Soldiers were posted to the battalion after completing initial infantry training in the United Kingdom and further training at the base depots of the AIF divisions in France. The role of the 1st Anzac Entrenching Battalion was to accelerate and improve the training process by providing reinforcement infantrymen with exposure to combat conditions while undertaking engineering works near the front line. The battalion initially provided all infantry reinforcements for the I ANZAC Corps, but all of its personnel were posted to combat units as part of the response to the heavy casualties suffered by the Australian units involved in the Battle of Pozi√®res between July and September 1916. While it ceased to provide training to infantrymen, the 1st Anzac Entrenching Battalion's headquarters and staff were retained and the unit absorbed the surplus reinforcements for the AIF's tunnelling companies; these comprised 9 officers and 203 other ranks. The battalion subsequently operated as a tunnelling unit on the Western Front alongside Canadian tunnellers. It was disbanded on 20 October 1917.

Yemenite Jewish woman in Saada 1986, Yemen Yemenite Jews in Saada in 1986, Yemen According to Rabbi Yahya Yousef Salem who is the rabbi of a Jewish community that has lived in the northern province of Saada, The community is very old in his words ‚ÄúJewish settlement in Saada could be as old as the Torah‚Äù. According to A report made in 1999 by the US state department, Approximately 500 Jews are scattered in a handful of villages between Sana'a and Saada in northern Yemen. David carasso who was a Jewish merchant from Thessaloniki, spent his years 1874‚Äì9 in Yemen, and described the Saada Jews as a ‚Äúwarrior Jews‚Äù, he also mentioned the good relationship between the Arabs of the area and the Saada community Jews. The Jews from that area were to be found strong and tall, they were belong to a bellicose race, and were always armed in the Arab way with a curved djambi and the rifle. In 1908 a group left the remote areas of Saada, they made their way to Palestine through the coast of Ashir, with a boat from there. A homemade alcohol was made by the Jews in the area and was consumed with khat, as a social aspect of life it was consumed in a small group, and described in a testimony from the early 1900s as a \\"delightful time\\". An example for a Muslim prosecution was describe in 1992 as Jews from the Saada area were not allowed to put burial stones on their graves, it was forbidden. Another prohibition from 1992 was that a cooking utensils cannot be shared by Jews, if it has been used by Muslims. Sanaa's Jewish community lives in a guarded district under the protection of the central government, after fleeing to the capital from the town of Saada following Houthis threats in 2007. ‚ÄúWe warn you to leave the area immediately... Ignore this message, and we give you a period of 10 days, and you will regret it,‚Äù a Houthi representative warned the Jewish community of Saada at the time. They sought refuge in the night with Sheikh Bakhtan ‚Äì Jews have traditionally been protected by tribal sheikhs. It was Sheikh Bakhtan who drove the rabbi's family to the capital, where the community of 70 remains under the president's protection. According to a report made by The U.S Department Of State in 2008, Jews in Yemen are the only indigenous non- Muslim religious minority. Nearly all of the once-sizable Jewish population has emigrated. Fewer than 400 Jews remain in the northern part of the country, primarily in Amran Governorate. Since January 2007 the historic Saada Governorate community of 45 Jews has lived in Sana'a, under the protection and care of the Government, after abandoning their homes in the face of threats from al-Houthi rebels. The community has abandoned its synagogues in Saada. There is at least one functioning synagogue in Amran Governorate. In the year 2015, only 70 Jews from Saada remain.

She fought against Indian baby marriages, pleading that the marriageable age of girls be raised to 14 years. Biography Nancie Monelle was born in 1841 in New York City. Her paternal ancestors belonged to the ancient family of Monelle, of the province of Tours, France. Her great-grandfather came to America with the young Marquis de Lafayette, and, admiring the country very much, did not return to France. Her father, an accomplished scholar, died while she was an infant. Monelle was the second physician sent out by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and Lucknow was the second city in India occupied by a woman medical missionary, at least of the Methodist Church. She had graduated from the Vassar College, and in 1872 from the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, taking first prize in surgery. After a year of hospital and private practice in New York City, she was sent to India in 1873 and appointed to Lucknow. Her profession opened the way into houses that had never been entered by a Christian. At the end of the first year she accepted an invitation to Hyderabad, Deccan, having withdrawn from the Mission, and refunded her passage and outfit money. She was the first lady doctor who ever went out alone into a Princely state. The ruler of the province furnished elephants, a regiment of sepoys, and a band of music to escort her to the palaces of the various noblemen of the city. At the expiration of three years, having established a dispensary and hospital, and treated over 40,000 patients, besides having an important private practice among the nawabs and nobles, she married Rev. Dr. Henry Mansell, of the General Missionary Society, and returned with him to the Northwest Provinces. In 1880, they removed to Moradabad. The year 1890 will be memorable for the great agitation regarding baby marriages. Such revelations of inhumanity had been brought to light that Dr. Mansell drew up a petition, which was cheerfully signed by 55 woman physicians, and was presented to the Viceroy and Governor-General, pleading that the marriageable age of girls be raised to 14 years. The 13 instances‚Äîonly a few out of many hundreds‚Äî given in the petition, of cruel wrongs, deaths, and maimings for life received by helpless child-wives at the hands of brutal husbands, which had come under her personal observation or that of her associates, were horrible almost beyond belief. While the Government was flooded with petitions and memorials from native Christians, Hindu women, and missionaries, it is stated that nearly all the speakers in the Legislative Council referred to the facts presented in this memorial, which had great influence in bringing about the change of raising the age to 12 years (not 14, as asked), \\"possibly the most important step taken in the domestic and social life of the people since the abolishment of suttee, in 1829.\\" References * * Bibliography * * Category:1841 births Category:American women physicians Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Female Christian missionaries Category:Methodist missionaries in India Category:Physicians from New York (state) Category:Year of death missing Category:American Methodist missionaries Category:American expatriates in India Category:Christian medical missionaries ","title":"Nancie Monelle"},{"id":"52145378","text":"Sue City is an unincorporated community in Macon County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

The Health Agency was established to coordinate and streamline the County's physical health, public health, and behavioral health care services, programs, and policies under a single integrated system of care. The Health Agency is presently led by Fred Leaf as interim director.https://healthagency.lacounty.gov/leadership/ In FY 2015-16, the three departments comprising the Los Angeles County Health Agency had a combined annual budget of , constituting about 25% of the County's total annual budget. The County Health Agency employs 31,887 employees. History From 1972 to 1978, the Los Angeles County Department of Health (now the Department of Health Services) provided the full continuum of physical, mental and public health services and functions. However, in 1978, the County established the Department of Mental Health to provide behavioral health services, amid concerns that funding for mental health services was being diverted to the County's hospitals. In 2006, the Department of Public Health was separated from the Department of Health Services, during a major budget deficit. On January 13, 2015, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors publicly directed the Chief Executive Office to assess the feasibility of consolidating the County's three health departments into a single unified health agency. This was preceded by correspondence between the Board and Mitchell Katz, the then current director of Health Services, who had submitted a confidential proposal to integrate the three departments on January 2, 2015. On October 6, 2015, the Board adopted an ordinance to create the Health Agency, effective November 5, 2015. The proposal was criticized by community advocates, providers, and labor unions, who have argued that physical health services would be prioritized above mental and public health services, and potential conflicts of interest. The Health Agency is led by the Health Agency Director, who oversees, manages, coordinates, monitors and evaluates the Agency's programs and services. During the COVID-19 pandemic the department was criticized for its handling of nursing homes.

It was serialized in the publisher Kadokawa Shoten's magazine Monthly Sh≈çnen Ace from April 2004 to September 2005. The series individual chapters were compiled into four collected volumes and published from November 2004 to October 2005 by Kadokawa Shoten. It was later licensed in Northern America by Tokyopop for an English-language publication, which was released from March 2010 to April 2011. It has been republished by Kadokawa Shoten in 2011, and Viz Media released it in digital format in English. The series tells the story of Daisuke Aso, a private detective who investigates paranormal cases involving Japanese urban legends that come to exist because of people's belief. Manga critics considered this concept interesting, although most of them did not find the series to be as unsettling as a horror series could be. Some argued it was more comedic than horrific, and its pacing was mostly criticized. Its art was met with divergent opinions, but the overall consensus is that while human characters are not well drawn, Esuno's monsters are very well done and horrifying. Plot is a former police officer who is known as the allegory detective because he investigates allegories‚Äîurban legends that manifest physically and possess people who believe in them. Daisuke himself is possessed by two. The first is the belief that he will die if he hiccups more than 100 times in a row. When an allegory is closer, Daisuke hiccups, so it is his way to detect an allegory but in every case he runs the risk of dying of the hiccups. The second is , a girl who in the legend haunts girls' school restrooms but now helps Daisuke to run his agency. She provides technical support by creating the \\"anti-allegory program\\" that can \\"de-visualize\\" the allegories, revealing their real form to its believers. Daisuke and Hanako are also accompanied by the human girl , who works with them since they helped to solve her allegory problem and she had no money to pay for it. Publication Written and illustrated by Sakae Esuno, the chapters of Hanako and the Terror of Allegory appeared as serial in the monthly manga magazine Sh≈çnen Ace from April 26, 2004 to September 26, 2005. Kadokawa Shoten collected its 19 chapters into four tank≈çbon volumes, and published them from November 1, 2004, to October 26, 2005. Later, on September 26, 2011, Kadokawa started to re- release the series in a kanzenban edition, which spawned three volumes, with the last one being published on November 26, 2011. An English translation was done by Tokyopop that published the four volumes between March 9, 2010, and April 26, 2011. As Tokyopop closed its North American publishing division in May 2011, its rights returned to Kadokawa Shoten. In October 2015, Viz Media relicensed it and published the first three volumes in digital format from October 27 to December 22. Hanako and the Terror of Allegory has also been translated into Chinese by Kadokawa Hong Kong, and in French by Casterman. Volume list=Reception Most reviewers found its premise to be interesting, but there was no consensus on Esuno's ability to explore it properly. While Ash Brown of Experiments in Manga concluded \\"Esuno does some interesting things with it\\", Shaenon Garrity wrote for About.com that the concept \\"is intriguing, but it's been done better‚Äîwith creepier creatures, more atmospheric artwork, and cleverer twists on the basic premise‚Äîin manga like Eiji Otsuka's and Housui Yamazaki's Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service and CLAMP's xxxHolic.\\" Thomas Zoth of Mania considered that the first volume \\"fails to take full advantage of its potential\\" because of its episodic nature and lack of characters development. In a review of the whole series, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku dubbed it \\"great fun\\" and said it \\"gets a lot of mileage out of its premise\\", praising how it interchanges between horror, action, comedy and romance and how in \\"each case you learn about a different Japanese urban legend and get hints about the deeper motivations and personal histories of each of the three main characters.\\" Both Carlo Santos of Anime News Network and Chris Zimmerman of Comic Book Bin also praised its mix of action and horror, and Santos called it \\"the perfect horror-suspense blend\\". Lori Henderson of Manga Xanadu said \\"it's the human elements of the stories, and their resolutions that [she] found to be the most interesting\\". Oliver Ho of PopMatters considered it is full of aspects that were worth \\"a ponderous and academic exercise\\", saying that the series \\"seems to be a meditation ... on the relationship between storytelling and psychology.\\" He compared the fact that in the manga \\"characters must confront personal demons and fears in order to overcome evil spirits\\" to an affirmation by Bruno Bettelheim's on The Uses of Enchantment, where he writes that \\"a myth, like a fairy tale, may express an inner conflict in symbolic form and suggest how it may be solved.\\" Overall, characters attracted criticism like those by Sean Gaffney of A Case Suitable for Treatment, who affirmed they are \\"rather colorless\\". Kanae's role in the first volume was especially criticized by Garrity, who said her reasoning to become Daisuke's assistant is \\"more or less random\\". Danica Davidson for Graphic Novel Reporter and Henderson also viewed negatively that Kanae's role was to be someone for Daisuke to rescue. Bill Sherman of Blogcritics was more positive, saying in a volume two review that the main trio \\"remain appealing enough ... to get most readers wanting to find out what happens in the next book\\". Although Snow Wildsmith of ICv2 dubbed the characters \\"forgettable\\", she appreciated the first volume because it shows that Daisuke has \\"a potentially interesting backstory.\\" Henderson also praised some of his backstory revelations, while Zoth commented the mention of his special power in the first volume was a positive indication \\"that there is more depth to the world and characters than Esuno has thus far revealed.\\" Indeed, when this power was revealed, Santos affirmed \\"the most remarkable thing about Hanako that it still has the capacity to surprise\\", and Zimmerman stated it was a \\"page turner\\" that \\"show[ed] exactly what Esuno is capable of when given the opportunity to explore his imagination.\\" The series' horror was mostly criticized; Henderson asserted \\"it isn't really a horror title ... It's more of the psychological horror\\", while Wildsmith considered the stories not \\"scary enough to make this collection horror\\", nor \\"thought provoking enough to make it a psychological thriller\\". Sherman said it \\"isn't as unsettling as it could be: there are terrors, after all, which reflect the characters' primal fears, yet Esuno doesn't delve as deeply into 'em as he could\\". Most reviewers agreed it was not that scary, but at least featured \\"creepy\\" and \\"spooky\\" moments. Santos felt that it \\"would probably be a lot more horrifying ... if it didn't keep trying to be cute and funny with the characters\\", especially criticizing Hanako's role who \\"make[s] annoying quips that derail the creepy mood of the series\\". Zack Davisson of Japan Reviewed remarked that when it \\"is playing with straight horror, it really shines\\" so the second and third volumes were considered an improvement over the first as they relied less on \\"cheap gags\\" and \\"panty-gags\\" and \\"deliver[ed] some actual horror\\". Ho also said it has \\"an incredibly goofy sense of humour\\", and while Garrity concluded that \\"promising blend of comedy and horror\\", the manga \\"doesn't quite work as comedy or horror\\", some reviewers appreciated this humor and horror mix. Ed Sizemore of Comics Worth Reading affirmed it is a good reading for those who \\"like light horror with sense of humor\\", and Henderson said it is \\"a light read with just a touch of the shiver factor\\". Esuno's art and its adequacy to a horror series received very discrepant opinions. Garrity commented the art is not \\"horrific\\" and that \\"most of the art is flat and generic, with vaguely cute big-eyed characters, bland backgrounds and a paucity of detail\\". However, \\"horrific\\" was precisely the word used by Gaffney to describe it, and Davisson wrote he has not \\"seen anyone draw horror as well as Esuno\\". Zimmerman affirmed it is \\"downright creep at times\\", and Sherman found \\"some effective visuals\\" like for the kuchisake-onna. Scott Green of Ain't It Cool News, who said Esuno \\"isn't great at horror\\", praised the same scene and pondered that large-scale panels like those \\"manage [to provide] some creepy spectacles\\". More consensual was that Esuno's monsters were better drawn his human characters. For example, Zoth praised backgrounds and monsters but called human designs \\"generic and unmemorable\\" and that \\"looks to be a half-finished state.\\" Henderson said, \\"It's fairly average in the portrayal of the humans, but the monsters are ... creepy and sometimes downright disturbing\\". Santos commended Esuno's \\"striking supernatural imagery\\" as exemplified by how \\"classic creatures ... take on new levels of terrifying\\". He also praised its \\"straightforward paneling [that] brings the story to the forefront and minimizes distractions\\", but he said \\"some of the character designs look like the work of a rookie\\". Zimmerman asserted that \\"though not quite as polished as fans have come to expect, [it] is fitting with his otherworldy designs and outlandish characters.\\" More negative was Wildsmith who called the art \\"ordinary: cute character types clash with uninspired horror images\\". More positive was Sizemore, saying mood and emotions are well conveyed, and monsters are well crafted. Another aspect cited as a drawback to its horror was its pacing and the third story was especially criticized. Green said it \\"frequently suffers when the reader engages it\\" and that the twists in the first volume \\"are obvious or aggravating\\", considering the Human-Fish story \\"trampl[es] ground that will be very problematic for some audiences\\". Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock criticized this story because of Esuno's treatment of rape, saying the girl saving her rapist vindicates his abuse. Zoth considered the Human-Fish story \\"a complete misfire\\" and its twists \\"completely ridiculous\\". Similarly, Santos and Zimmerman felt it was \\"convoluted\\", while considered the first chapter was \\"rushed\\", attributing it to Esuno's lack of pacing. Nonetheless, both Santos and Zimmerman were mixed regarding the pacing. Although stated it was \\"so frequently sloppy in its execution\\", Santos praised it because \\"the deadpan, Twilight Zone-esque introductions to each chapter set the perfect tone, and the tension builds up at just the right pace‚Äîyou know when those shocking moments are going to hit, but it doesn't make them any less terrifying when they happen\\". Zimmerman commented that \\"if the series has one weakness, it would have to be its pacing\\", but \\"still, horror fans will find much to like about the series\\" as \\"the stories will have readers guessing the whole way through\\". On the other hand, Henderson said the second and the third stories had \\"a nice twist\\", and Gaffney affirmed \\"the pacing is excellent\\", commending the \\"balance between cute innocent victims, poorly communicating boyfriends, and complete jerkass monsters.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Action anime and manga Category:Horror anime and manga Category:Kadokawa Shoten manga Category:Occult detective anime and manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Viz Media manga ","title":"Hanako and the Terror of Allegory"},{"id":"52145687","text":"Reverse smoking is a kind of smoking where the burnt end of a hand rolled tobacco leaf is put in the mouth rather than the unlit end of the cigar.

He is director of The Center for Regenerative Medicine, which he founded in 2000 in order to pursue pioneering regimens in the treatment of arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. He coined the term \\"orthopedic regenerative medicine\\" to characterize his groundbreaking work. Since the center's creation, he has limited himself to non-surgical orthopedics and sports medicine. For the 2012 London Olympics, Farshchian served as consulting Orthopedic Regenerative Medicine physician for the Team USA track-and-field team. Education and early career Farshchian earned his M.D. degree from Spartan Health Sciences University in St. Lucia in 1987. The following year, he joined the research staff at the State University of New York in NY, and New York Research Foundation. He completed his internship at The University of Tennessee College of Medicine. In 1994, he relocated to Philadelphia and completed additional medical education in a program affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. He began his private medical practice in Hawaii in 1997. Two years later, he relocated to Miami. In 2000, he founded The Center for Regenerative Medicine. He received Board certification in 1997. He is a member of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. Innovative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases Since July 2016, Farshchian has focused on developing innovative new treatments for major neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. Parkinson' stem cells project is a non-invasive treatment he has developed uses the re-injection of stem cells taken from the patient. Preliminary research indicates the therapy can possibly improve the debilitating symptoms caused by neurodegenerative diseases. Since 2011, Farshchian has integrated the use of T'ai chi, Yoga and Qigong into his treatment plans for patients suffering from arthritis and sports injuries. His results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the additional, non-traditional therapies for many patients. Treatment of Michael Jackson Farshchian is best known on a worldwide basis for his treatment of pop superstar Michael Jackson from April 2001 until December 2003. He initially treated Jackson for an ankle injury that hampered his ability to perform, but after a close personal friendship developed, Farshchian attempted to intervene and cure Jackson of his addiction to Demerol. Farshchian convinced Jackson and his family that an implant chip of the medication Naltrexone, which inhibits the effects of narcotics such as Demerol, could help the singer wean himself off Demerol. The treatment was successful. During his treatment, Jackson traveled multiple times to Miami, where he stayed in a private room created for him in Farshchian's garage.

He was the director of Tipograf√≠a Nacional de Guatemala (National Typography of Guatemala), minister of promotion, editor of La Locomotora (a magazine from the ministry of the government, its purpose was to direct the people), and he was the Guatemalan ambassador to the United States government. He represented Guatemala and as representative he signed the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war. __TOC__  Biography  President Jos√© Mar√≠a Reina Barrios placed Joaqu√≠n M√©ndez as the director of Tipograf√≠a Nacional de Guatemala (National Typography of Guatemala) and he was still in that position when the president was assassinated on February 8, 1898. The acting president, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, asked him to command the completion of a booklet that was very important for the new leader. The booklet was Or√°culo nov√≠simo (Newest Oracle) or libro de los destinos (Book of destinies). From the moment on a friendly relationship was made that lasted until the end of Cabrera's time as president. This was in large part due to Joaquin's friendly personality. Joaquin's career inside Cabrera's administration advanced, mostly due to his gift with people. After La Locomotora stopped publishing in 1909 he continued working with the government. In 1911, when the administration of the President of the United States, William Howard Taft, wasn't able to make the Guatemalan government commit to accept an onerous loan, he served a very important diplomatic mission to the Secretary of State, Philander C. Knox. The purpose of his mission was to avoid the removal of Estrada Cabrera from the Guatemalan presidency. As a reward for his excellent labor, Estrada Cabrera named his as the Guatemalan ambassador. This took place in Washington on November 4, 1911. Joaquin remained in this position until April 1920, which was the end of the Cabrera administration.

He recorded with the guitarists Curley Weaver and Buddy Moss in 1933, after which there is no definitive documentation of his life or whereabouts. McMullen was born in Florida sometime in 1905. Little else is known about his life prior to his recording sessions with Weaver and Moss, except that he spent time incarcerated at a convict camp in DeKalb County, Georgia. McMullen, who may have settled in Macon after being released from prison, was a regular performer at the 81 Theater in Atlanta, where he first encountered Weaver and Moss. According to Kate McTell in an interview, McMullen was responsible for introducing Moss to her husband, the guitarist Blind Willie McTell, initiating later collaborations between the two. She also suggested that Georgia White wrote songs for McMullen while in Atlanta. From January 16 to 19, 1933, McMullen joined Weaver, Moss, and Ruth Willis for recording sessions in New York City. Providing bottleneck guitar accompaniment tuned in open G, McMullen also sang lead on \\"Joker Man Blues\\" and \\"Next Door Man\\", which was released by Vocalion Records and credited to \\"Jim Miller\\". He was also the main guitarist on several tracks, including \\"Wait and Listen\\", a song with a striking resemblance to Tommy Johnson's style, and \\"Roll Mama\\", in which McMullen and Weaver played simultaneous guitar solos. On the final day of the sessions, McMullen joined Weaver and Ross to record as the Georgia Browns, releasing \\"It Must Have Been Her\\" and \\"Who Stole De Lock?\\" McMullen apparently moved on after the sessions concluded, never to record again. The Atlanta city directory listed him once, in 1932, filing his name as MacMullin. Moss recalled very little about McMullen but speculated that he returned to Macon. No record of his death is known, but the blues historian Bob L. Eagle hypothesized he could be the same Fred McMullen who died in February 1960. Much of his work has appeared on the compilation albums Country Blues Classics, Volume 1, Georgia Blues 1927‚Äì1930, Some Cold, Rainy Day, and Bottleneck Blues Guitar Classics 1926‚Äì37.

Early life Broadbent was born in 1984 with HIV. She was adopted at 6 weeks old, and her adoptive parents, Loren and Patricia Broadbent, found out she had HIV three years after her adoption. Not much was known about Hydeia, as her birth mother left her at a Las Vegas hospital. The hospital called Hydeia's adoptive parents, as Hydeia's birth mother had given birth at the same hospital to another child and left him there, and both mother and child tested positive for HIV. The Broadbents tested Hydeia soon after, and she tested positive for HIV. Her adoptive mother signed her up for a research trial to hopefully find a treatment that would work for Hydeia. Growing up, Hydeia regularly had brain and blood infections, pneumonia, and fungal infections in her brain. It was predicted that she would not survive childhood, and would die at the age of 5. She survived, however, but when she was five she developed AIDS. Life and activism Broadbent began her activism at age 6, by speaking about living with HIV/AIDS. She first got involved with speaking on the subject through Elizabeth Glaser, creator of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The two met while Hydeia was undergoing treatment at the National Institutes of Health. Glaser asked Hydeia's mother to let Hydeia speak publicly about having HIV/AIDS, and she acquiesced. Hydeia went on to speak at many events, including AIDS benefit concerts, documentaries, college campus education events, and talk shows. She appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1996. Recently, she appeared on Oprah's Where Are They Now, as she was one of the most-requested guests to be revisited. She appeared on a Nickelodeon special along with Magic Johnson. Two years after the special, she established the Hydeia L. Broadbent Foundation and received a Black Achievement Award from Jet magazine. She also appeared in Essence, and on The Maury Povich Show, Good Morning America, and at the 1996 Republican National Convention. At the Republican National Convention, she famously stated \\"I am the future, and I have AIDS.\\" In 2002, her family published a book entitled You Get Past The Tears, and the family appeared in 2004 on Extreme Home Makeover. Broadbent currently speaks on the behalf of the Magic Johnson Foundation and other AIDS activist organizations in order to educate people about HIV/AIDS, raise awareness, and fight discrimination against those living with HIV/AIDS. She also is involved in screening drives, along with actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. Broadbent has traveled extensively both nationally and internationally to speak to others. Broadbent currently takes three antiretroviral pills a day, and the majority of her medical payments come out of pocket. According to her, \\"HIV is not a death sentence, but it's a life sentence...[y]ou'll be taking pills forever, going to the doctor and fighting for insurance forever.\\" She hopes that by sharing her story, things will begin to change.

He owned the Brigad√©r Halling House in Copenhagen and Dronninglund in Vendsyssel. Early life Halling was born in the rectory in H√•rslev on Zealand, the son of the local vicar Mogens Halling and his wife Elisabeth Marie n√©e Olivarius. The family came from the Halling Valley in Akershus, Norway. In 1859 he became an assistant in the Danish Asia Company in Copenhagen. Years in India He travelled to Tranquebar in 1760 and a few years later continued to College on the Malabar Coast. He was promoted to senior assistant (overassistent) but fell foul of opperhoved P. Scheel and returned to Tranquebar in 1766 from where he continued to Bengal to enroll in the British army. He served under Major-General Robert Clive, was promoted to captain, and, probably in Spanish service, took part in the conquest of Manila. Return to Denmark The Brigad√©r Holling House in Copenhagen, now housing the Maltese embassy Halling achieved considerable wealth during his years in India. On his way back to Denmark, on board a ship to the Netherlands, he was captured by pirates and brought to Algiers where he was sold as a slave. He finally made it back to Denmark in about 1772. In 1773, he purchased the Brigad√©r title for 1,000 Danish rigsdaler. He was given the rank of Major-General and became part of the board of directors in the Danish Asia Company. He purchased a house in Lille Strandstr√¶de and commissioned the architect Hans N√¶ss to undertake a comprehensive refurbishment of the property. He also acquired the Bryskesborg estate in Jutland, renaming it Qilliamsborg. In January 1774, he married Christine Linde Hvas de Lindenpalmm the only daughter of J√∏rgen Hvas de Lindenpalm. As part of the marriage agreement, with effect from 1 May 1774, he received the estate Tirsb√¶k at a low price as well as 10m000 rigsdaler in the gand as dowry. Landowner in Jutland Dronninglund Castle In 1776, he ceded Tirsb√¶k to count Caspar von Moltke in exchange for Dronninglund in Vendsyssel. Here later constructed a large town mansion in Aalborg (now Hotel Ph√∏nic). He also acquired Petersholm at Vejle and K√¶rg√•rd in the parish of Hunderup. He also purchased a property in the Vesterbro area of Aalborg and constructed a large town mansion (now Hotel Ph√∏nix). In 1776 he became a White Knight at a cost of 10,000 rigsdaler and was ennobled by letter patent in 1783. Legacy Halling has a reputation for being a brutal ruler of his estate and for leading a somewhat bizarre lifestyle. The rough treatment of tenant farmers was, however, a common phenomenon at the time. He had an Indian servant and brought and had acquired an oriental taste for splendor during his years in India. His marriage was unhappy and the couple lived apart at times. Halling constructed 21 residences for soldiers on the Dronninglund estate. He launched a programme which taught boys a craft and hired a physician on the estate in 1790. In 1796, he created a trust for indigent residents of the Dronninglund estate. Halling died in 1796. His widow sold Dronninglund in 1806. She then settled at Keldk√¶r where she died a very wealthy woman in 1817.

Montreal Gazette, February 13, 1992. History Steele's early years were spent singing in more of the classical and folk vein. She participated in several choirs and operas in her hometown of Comox and later in Victoria (both on Vancouver Island). At the age of 19, she moved to Vancouver to become a professional singer, but found she was too inexperienced to front a band. She returned to Victoria and after she answered an ad in the local newspaper she joined her first band Room Service in 1984 where she performed in various rock clubs and on TV in the CBC competition Rock Wars, which was televised nationally. A year later, she accepted a gig playing with the hard rock band Reform School. The band gave her a foundation to hone her skills as a front person playing clubs in B.C and Alberta with several bands including Blu, and the first incarnation of the Chrissy Steele Band with several members including Burk Ehmig, Rick Smook, Matteo Caratozzolo and Brian McConkey .\\"Despite sexy album cover, B.C. sunger Chrissy Steele rejects sex-symbol image\\". Ottawa Citizen, January 16, 1992. In 1989 Brian MacLeod, after hearing about her talents through the grapevine, invited her to join his band Headpins, which had been looking for a new singer since Darby Mills left the band in 1986.\\"Brian 'Too Loud' MacLeod refuses to let cancer come between him and his passion...rock'n'roll\\". The Province, October 6, 1991. However, with the rest of the original Headpins having moved on to other projects, MacLeod was unable to convince them to reunite, and instead decided to record a new album with Steele. (As a side note: The Headpins name would not prove to be successful as the label Chrysalis Records they eventually signed with were not interested in the Headpins brand). The majority of songs were written by Brian MacLeod and Tim Feehan. MacLeod and Steele with the help of their manager Sam Feldman, and also Bruce Allen would be shopped to labels finally hooking Chrysalis Records/EMI. With an introduction to New York Chrysalis executives John Sykes (President) and Joe Keiner (CEO), and flying out to see the band live, Macleod and Steele were signed to a multi-million multi-album record deal. Sadly, during production of the album and a warm-up tour, MacLeod became ill, and after the release of the album he succumbed to cancer on April 25, 1992. During his illness, and incapacitated, it was thought best by the label for Steele to continue on as a solo artist after signing with American label Chrysalis Records/EMI. The album, Magnet to Steele, was released in 1991,\\"Hard rock belter prefers coffee to sex\\". Edmonton Journal, August 3, 1991. and spawned the hit singles \\"Love You 'Til It Hurts\\" and \\"Love Don't Last Forever\\". With a touring band consisting of Joe Wowk (replacing Brian MacLeod) on guitars, Tim Webster on keyboards, Anton Vogt on bass and Rick Fedyk on drums, Steele supported the album first playing with Bryan Adams in Revelstoke in 1991, then with a cross-Canada tour as an opening act for Bryan Adams,\\"Adams wakes up the Metro Centre\\". Halifax Daily News, January 15, 1992. and in the United States as an opener for Jethro Tull's entire Catfish Rising American Tour . Steele also played as part of the line up at Thunderbird stadium in Vancouver for Molson's Great Canadian Party on July 1, 1992 featuring (in order of appearance) Eugene Ripper, The Grapes of Wrath, SkyDiggers, Rita Chiarelli, Crash Test Dummies, Chrissy Steele, Colin James, The Tragically Hip, and Spinal Tap. In addition to her Juno nomination for Most Promising Female Vocalist, Magnet to Steele was a nominee for Rock Album of the Year. After the album had run its course commercially, her record label flew her to Los Angeles to record demos for her follow-up album, but Steele felt the material was subpar. She was no longer comfortable with the \\"sexpot biker-chick\\" image she was being marketed under, but instead wanted to adopt a more introspective and adult style. With Grunge dominating the airwaves, her label waning, and being bought out by the Chrysalis Group with the bottom falling out of it, Steele took her cue, and quit the music business. As an avid environmentalist, she worked a term for Greenpeace in Vancouver - eventually returning to University in Victoria. She performed a few isolated concert dates with a new all-female backing band in Quebec City, and Montreal in 1994 and sang guest vocals on Feehan's 1996 album Pray for Rain, but by 1997 onward she was working as a graphic designer and communications professional in Victoria, BC.

Smick, a financial market consultant, non-fiction author, and Chairman and CEO in the consultancy company of Johnson Smick International (JSI). This book opposes the views of Thomas Friedman's The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century. Smick considers the potential negative ramifications of a constantly fluctuating global economy and analyzes possible solutions to these challenges. End of global economy Globalization has achieved unprecedented economic development.chapter1,41p However, the global economy is unstable and sometimes badly agitated. Also, the era of massive wealth creation has led to the era of financial crises.chapter1,42p Even though there was a problem, globalization was an effective means of producing wealth. Even though it has been a long time, we do not fully understand the meaning of globalization. People tend to regard the economy as static, but the global economy is very dynamic. Unlike earlier systems that large corporations and regulators have controlled to maintain their power, the new global economy is rapidly changing the way it operates through the Internet, boosting the business value of large-scale collaboration over the Internet.chapter1,46p~47p We have no choice but to embrace the ever- changing global market and steer the market to avoid unintended consequences and side effects. The most important thing to stabilize the market is the 'trust'. There is no way to maintain stability since the size of the financial market has relatively grown.chapter1,50p~51p Danger of tremendous financial resources The U.S. financial system was once closed, but the United States soon changed into a part of the interconnected global network. The international migration of saving funds redefined the global economic outlook and reshaped the structure.chapter2,74p~75p Since the 1980s, the international financial system has developed a new set of risk management techniques and new advanced financial instruments, and these efforts have led to various ways of success. Among them, asset securitization has been a great source of funding for the global financial revolution, which can significantly reduce the scope of global investment and split the stakes into a wide range of revenue sources. But the financial process of asset itself had a new problem. Asset securitization has allowed widespread funding to induce widespread changes in the economy, allowing widespread financing to take place, but it has spread to a huge problem if it suffers from itself. Asset securitization provided another major vulnerability to today's financial systems. The banks that lend loans do not cling to the danger of borrowers taking loans. The lender no longer needs to cling to compensate for its efforts to avoid danger in any case, as it is divided into the risk of loan. However, it is not only possible to talk about asset securitization as in black and white. If we ban asset securitization, the overall lending of the U.S. and the China will severely decline and the economy will shrink greatly.chapter2,81p~83p Since 1980, there has been a significant increase in global capital.chapter2,82p Therefore, foreign investment in the United States has been increased. And it was good for U.S. The notion that the U.S. economy depends on foreign capital may sound dangerous. But the situation is not that serious. The savings fund is still based on the U.S. dollar, as its size is so large that only two kinds of the assets denominated in dollar and Euro assets are properly invested to cover the large amounts of capital. What European policymakers do not want to face the world's excessive saving funds is flowing in to Europe and it makes Euro more valuable. Because it means that Europe's product lower position in the world's market. The dollar is still an essential commodity for the commodity, currency, and derivatives of the world. The value of the dollar, which reflects inflation, is too high compared to other Asian currencies. It is necessary to implement coordinated efforts to resolve the exchange rate gap. But if the U.S. financial system fails to restore trust or if the Federal fails to respond to inflation expectations, the debate will end and the dollar will fall into turmoil.chapter2,94p The Asian central bank will not deliberately carry out anything that could undermine the dollar as well as the sale of U.S. treasuries. That is because they are degrading the entire value of the enormous dollar they hold.chapter2,97p The United States should maintain its position as an attractive target for investment, and its fiscal imbalances should be resolved quickly.chapter2,108p Private equity funds and hedge fund companies who have fallen to the problem. Today, hedge funds and private equity companies have become increasingly new worries for international financial systems.chapter3,115p The hedge fund has a very significant as an actor who is historically appearing in a drama titled \\"Great Globalization\\". Hedge fund investors are the first ones to use the new global financial structure to devise and market differences. Based on the macroeconomic assessment of the global economy, they began to form a diversified investment portfolio by studying many international markets. Despite criticism that the hedge fund is irresponsible, it is helping to focus on the market and make it more efficient, rather than relying on global financial uncertainties.chapter3,118p In the meantime, the word \\" entrepreneur \\" always meant something negative.chapter3,127p But they have improved our lives. And as they repeat success and failure, they learn objective lessons.chapter3,129p While existing companies are important to try to reform and improve the global market, it is important that new companies are willing to create new ideas that are willing to taking risks. However, there is a problem with corporate capitalism, which is extremely difficult to manage the wealth redistribution without a negative effect on the negative economy. It means that one should be able to tolerate some degree of unfairness with some degree of wealth and job creation. The corporate capitalism, which achieves continued innovation in a society, prevents people from staying there for a long time.chapter3,134p~135p Finally, the New York City financial community could have decayed because it failed to grasp the mobility of the dangerous species. Today, risk abusers can easily list new companies in the London Exchange as well as in New York City. It is even possible in Hong Kong. That is why they can make troubles in competitiveness if you increase regulatory barriers or treat rough in choosing rate of compensate compare to risk. And that's why entrepreneurs are perceived as being dangerous beings.chapter3,138p In order to sharpen competitiveness in today's global economy, it must develop a competitive idea that will enhance the atmosphere of existing companies and change the atmosphere of new growth and change.chapter3,139p Tony Soprano, a Chinese dragon. Conventional belief today is that China dominates the 21st century. Rapid growth in China threatens the entire world with economic bubble and financial bubble.chapter4,144p The fundamental problem with China is that it lacks reliable information about the nation's economic situation. However, a huge amount of foreign capital has poured into China even if the lack of transparency.chapter4,157p One of the reasons why it is very difficult to operate a broad range of macroeconomic operations is due to the massive imbalance in China. While the GDP of Shanghai is higher than that of Malaysia, the standard of living in many other regions is similar to that of Bangladesh.chapter4,164p But the real interest rate in China is increasing the economic bubble and the financial bubble. Since no one believes that bubbles will burst, they borrow as much as possible and buy lots of assets. However, bubbles always burst.chapter4,,167p Another problem with China is the question of population composition. Europe, Japan, and the United States are under heavy pressure of the population. However, the problems of these countries are very simple compared to China, which has caused population problems in terms of its one-child policy. In 2045, one out of every three Chinese people is old enough to be retired, and when the workforce declines, it will also decrease the standard of living, and this will cause a serious chain effect.chapter4,172p What happens in China is affecting the world. The problem is that China is growing too big. Therefore, the problem that bubbles occur is more serious than we think.chapter 4, p. 176-177 European strategists pointed out that in the 1970s, Germany experienced a strong growth rate and a higher capital inflow in the 1970s. The only way to prove that it was effective to safely land the economy at the time was a currency value. Other methods did not work. On the basis of this, European bureaucrats argued that curbing inflation is the only way to control inflation. To date, aside from some currency revaluation, the revaluation of the Chinese yuan, which is further dramatic revaluation, is not a simple issue. Now, the U.S. and China are faced with a dilemma. Surely, local governments will prefer to grow investment through investments, which will likely bring more control and increased possibility of corruption. And if Beijing stops the intervention of the central bank, the yuan will be highly appreciated and the price competitiveness of foreign goods sold in China will be higher. However, as the yuan is rising, the inefficient and incompetent state-owned firms will collapse, resulting in massive unemployment. However, through artificially lowering the value of the yuan, the U.S.'s current account deficits and the U.S. account deficits are surging to more than 5 percent of GDP, and this imbalance is not beneficial to either China or the United States.chapter4,180p~181p China's revaluation of the yuan will take longer than we think. China's producers oppose the prospect of a revaluation of the yuan because they believe that the profitability of Korean companies is too low to dampen exporters \` profitability.chapter4,183p However, the United States and China will have to solve current-account imbalances as a way of rebalancing and spending money together.chapter4,184p Japan's housewives, take the initiative. Japan is a representative example of the most complete and objective of the new global economy.chapter5,196p Japan's famous ' bubble economy ' has become an important event. At that time, the price of Japanese stocks, including stocks and real estate stocks, skyrocketed, and finally burst into a huge bubble in Japan.chapter5,199p It is inconceivable that Japanese policy failures have frustrated ordinary citizens' lives, and Japanese housewives have started to move.chapter5,204p Starting in the early 2000s, Japanese housewives started running directly to earn more money from their savings. Surprisingly, in the process, stay-at-home moms have emerged as powerful forces in the global foreign exchange market overnight. Currently, nearly one-fifth of all foreign exchange transactions are produced by Japanese individuals, many of which are occupied by Japanese housewives. They are increasing direct investment through the Internet, And if the housewives move together, they may be able to drop the global currency market by just two percent.chapter5,205p One of the biggest problems right now in Japan is the history of bureaucracy. Corporate capitalism - beset by capricious, persistent failure in global financial systems - does not consort with formal bureaucracy. In Japan, there is a slight bias toward the whims of free financial markets. Japanese bureaucrats are encouraged to avoid failure, ironically because the Japanese economy has fallen apart. Japanese bureaucrats do not know how to deal with entrepreneurial uncertainty and business failures that are essential to economic success.chapter5,207p~208p Japan's system of effectively managing bureaucracy and its essence is now facing a period of bending and brittle. Now, millions of stay-at-home mothers and other types of doctors no longer care about bureaucracy and its essence. They only care about the facts and insights that reflect future revenue and risks. Officials in Tokyo proposed a major overhaul of the banking and small business laws to encourage entrepreneurs to promote entrepreneurship. Also, Japanese political leaders understand the need for higher returns on the savings rate of housewives. Clearly, the Japanese economy requires entrepreneurial innovation.chapter5,216p 1992, the British pound sterling crisis: there is nothing in it to stay Our thoughts are fixed to the status quo, not many changes. We think that the current state always be the same. Institutions and the freedom of our times will keep forever give our financial assets, and will always be a belief that economies flourish because they've been far and institutional arrangements confidence never change.chapter6,232p But we also can not be avoided by changing the stereotypes that hold firmly the phenomenon will be maintained. All major participants active in the financial sector are aware that the level of common sense, as well as the global economic instability, and the structure continues to change. However, the vulnerability of the financial system in their minds is extremely ideological. Their eyes, as is currently seen as a change in the vaguely distant future threat, but is invisible to the eye in front risks encountered. Thus, they act as if there is a system of the global economy and the current institutional arrangement for the time being remain.chapter6,233p But ignorance of the realities of a changing world can be very dangerous. Europe's currency crisis in 1992 is a case to underestimate the power of the financial markets caused by human judgment and a political mistake this huge crisis due. Since ignorance of the changing world, the British pound has experienced a tremendous value plummeted this change the currency systems of Europe, given the continued strong shock to the global economy. These events show that this causes any risk to the folly does not recognize the changes in the global financial environment.chapter6,234p If you do not open your eyes to the threats in today's financial leaders have emerged over the horizon will lead to similar results as in the case of the United Kingdom. We do not need the current financial system has been thinking of course that managed to survive by silver bullet. However, in highly liquid capital of the world, like the 1992 UK case there is nothing which can of course here. There is nothing to stay in the same state that nothing in the world.chapter6,266p The central bank can avoid shrinking all believe People often think that the central bank had magical powers. No matter how the financial crisis occurs, I think the central bank lowered the interest rate financial market will return to normal. This is thought to be exaggerated, but the image of the central market than it actually is.chapter7,268p When the financial crisis occurred in the past, the present time response of the central bank measures that have worked can not exert more force. Now, aggressive central banks have been more difficult to rely on monetary policy. While the huge capital using the leverage is not a limit. The most recent case revealed the limitations of the central bank was in the early years of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis occurred the first time 2008. At the time the Federal Reserve central bank was faced with rising inflation and house prices collapse, banks lending crisis, the risk to the US economy fall into the weak dollar. Policy makers in the US are afraid there is no obvious solution to the risk of disappointing some policies were also aware of the fact that there can only lead to negative results. Also, look the United States who the US central bank is hardly a worldwide central bank had presided over the financial world of the dollar oriented, the sub-prime mortgage crisis has complete control of interest rate policy in the global financial system like anymore, while generating as globalization begins also it showed.chapter7,294p But the more serious problem is that the huge financial crisis, when there happen next, and no one is not sure whether the central bank will be and how many days to solve the financial crisis. Subprime mortgage crisis is nothing more than a side issue compared to the interruption of trade war with China and Asian capital flows caused by the aftermath.chapter7,298p The reality is that the global trade and financial capital to move freely in the siege being in the world can not deny anyone. And Democrats and Republicans in the US has been gradually move away from policies that constitute a tremendously explosive prosperity. The same is true in Europe and other countries. The market started to notice it, and it also noted the central bank troubled people. I am aware of the fact that a series of policy mistakes that caused the loss of long-term costs can be a huge disaster better than anyone. This was creating huge wealth and reduce poverty system in danger. This system has revolutionized the world to produce the goods in the global market in charitable donations. However, central banks, while solving the debt as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis was much more accurate understanding of the system. And the central bank began keeping the place they convince a new global monetary policy for the 21st century. The US Federal Reserve also avoiding that which severely damaged the US financial sector very carefully so that you can restore the world's confidence in the global financial markets, it is necessary to desperately try to restructure.chapter7,301p Class struggle and global politics Fragile banking system, and shrink all central banks face the global financial markets is difficult to predict the political change through the uncertainty of it all. In fact, globalization started in the 1970s and the depression action on the free capital market can be called a political product. Therefore, whether the global economy has indeed gotten to survive in the 21st century will depend on how the political world accepted for defects in the global economy. But whether the survival of today's global economy is being increasingly questioned. Today, a huge global capital has noted the introduction based political risk. Capricious and future-oriented commercial capital moves even slightly negative change in symptoms over the border to another country.chapter8,304p Country abandoned by the movement of capital in the process falls in financial panic. Excessive interference of the signals is the government claiming the class struggle and the trade protectionism of the negative changes that lead to this situation, and good intentions, but include changing financial and regulatory aspects of figured counterproductive. In fact, the world today can be bent because the political and financial markets were increasingly able to understand each other. And this phenomenon has been shown most strongly, particularly in the United States. The political movement who want to get away from the current capital market liberalization and free trade has been visible in the United States. Therefore, the United States lies in the critical time in terms of the private economy of the United States. Politicians have experienced economic success of both parties for 25 years. And it could watch the wealth creation and poverty reduction in the global economy moving toward a pure utopia in the late 1970s. But now they are inciting the public protectionism and waging the class struggle and controversy.chapter8,306p Because the future of the global economy is currently based essentially owns the financial and political capital is too small, it is impossible to predict. On the one hand, the income gap has been exacerbated. Therefore, the political base of support for the global economy is very weak. Over the past 25 years, people have believed the illusion of globalization since, no matter how policy-makers, even if the measures that continue to create a situation that can cause shock and disillusionment low unemployment would last forever. However, instead of looking for political leaders is how to attract more people into the corporate capitalist system, most are eager to grab this political masterpiece. Among people blame globalization for half the directors and present the class struggle, reckless protectionism and policies that can put the financial system at risk. If the proposed policy as it applies to their moving process of the last 25 years of global wealth creation and poverty reduction would be reversed. These claims are inciting the public has already destroyed the stability of financial markets.chapter8,334p~335p Therefore, in recent years in order to maintain political irresponsibility based on the global banking sector and against the political demagoguery that suggests a stupid way to support the new global economy, policymakers should focus on the role of human capital and growth.chapter8,340p Survival in changing times In today's dangerous world finance leaders have eyes wide open to face this risk. Before the rise in recent jidojaeun should establish an effective operational plan to reduce global imbalances. Also we have deep discussions in order to prepare for the terrible things that have just started to emerge. In particular, it must be equipped with a broad understanding of the global strategy and international monetary relations width in relation to China has emerged as a giant monster in the financial and manufacturing sectors. In addition, leaders must create the means to better understand the conflict and tension between the need to maintain a global trading system and the need to respond effectively to climate change. Leaders must create a reliable approach that reflects the opportunities and risks of investing these funds, contraction of liquidity around the world and we need to stop the reckless policy of trade protectionism and the class struggle, the fall of the dollar.chapter9,343p However, there is another problem beyond all this. It is that system to assess the credit risk and the need to adjust the distribution and flawed financial structure. While up the 2007 sub-prime lending crisis debt default, the financial system structure has changed enough to solve the problem was the worst of the financial crisis. destruction of the financial system is severely damaged an important political basis of globalization, threatened the livelihoods of millions of homes worldwide. Over time, the financial markets have been gradually stabilize underlying issues that are still unstable world situation just below the outwardly exposed.chapter9,344p Subprime mortgage crisis is regarding the government's ability to understand the market continues to evolve exposed the inherent vulnerability.chapter9,345p Therefore, there is a need to develop new systems that allow traders to assess the global market value more easily. Never, because no economy can develop without rebuilding your credit in today's new asset allocation system.chapter9,358p In the new global economy, policymakers should consider the concerns about the future as a collective property and the general risks of the global financial safety net.chapter9,369p Therefore, policy makers, and move a few years to get the global financial system has higher transparency and confidence in the future, and as a result we need to be more clearly that to achieve a high productive results. Out of the wrong faction attention of today's innovative monetary policy to focus on the big picture strategist it must work in close relationship with the private sector. We live in an age that can save a new global economic policy-makers need to properly capture important moments. And right now, this moment is an important historical moment.chapter9,383p~384p Unlike the past, today's brave policy leaders need a little more aggressive, have an effective agenda to avoid a disaster to move forward. Through good leadership, we can continue to be made to continue the remarkable development of the past 25 years. Otherwise, we will once again experience a new economic pain. The second of the Great Depression is unlikely to happen, it is not only absurd idea completely. Because the world is because fully curved.chapter9,385p  Reviews  Publishers Weekly reviewer Greg Alexander wrote: \\"Smick brings expertise and lucidity to many difficult subjects, and while his book's appeal will likely be limited to those with some background in the field, it will undoubtedly stir interest and debate amongst investors, policymakers and strategists alike.\\" In Foreign Affairs, Richard N. Cooper said that \\"This book is a rambling and anecdotal but enjoyable account by a participant-observer of the vital role the financial system has played in the huge growth in global prosperity over the past 25 years. Smick is unambiguous in holding private-sector players responsible for the emerging debacle.\\" Book review website Kirkus Reviews opined: \\"A supremely useful book for portfolio planning, though not the thing to give someone who's inclined to worry about the state of the world.\\" Forbes contributor Bret Swanson expressed disappointment that Smick lays little responsibility at the feet of the inflationary weak-dollar policy of the Federal Reserve. but he said that Smick ably identifies most of the crucial protectionist policy curves that threaten global prosperity. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said, \\"Economist David Smick had it right in The Post this week when he said the administration had a three-pronged strategy: delay, delay and delay.\\" in 2009. Columnist Michael Gerson of the Washington Post mentioned that \\"‚ÄòIt's not smart to say this economy can‚Äôt recover,‚Äô says economist and author David Smick.

McCabe joined the FBI as a special agent in 1996 and served with the bureau's SWAT team. He became a supervisory special agent in 2003 and held management positions of increasing responsibility until he was elevated to Deputy Director of the FBI in February 2016. From May 9, 2017, to August 2, 2017, McCabe served as the Acting Director of the FBI following James Comey's dismissal by President Donald Trump. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on March 16, 2018, 26 hours before his scheduled retirement. Sessions announced that he based his decision on reports from the DOJ Inspector General and the FBI's disciplinary office saying that McCabe had improperly authorized releases of information to The Wall Street Journal about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation and had misled agents who questioned him about it on four occasions, three of which were under oath. McCabe disputed these charges and alleged that his firing was politically motivated. In September 2019, federal prosecutors recommended McCabe be indicted for actions relating to the leak. On February 14, 2020, the Justice Department informed McCabe's attorneys that it had declined to prosecute McCabe. In August 2020, George Mason University announced McCabe would be joining the faculty of the Schar School of Policy and Government as Distinguished Visiting Professor. Early life McCabe was born in 1968. He graduated from The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1986. He graduated from Duke University in 1990 and obtained a J.D. degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1993. He was also a brother of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. During law school he interned in the criminal division of the United States Department of Justice. Because of a hiring freeze, McCabe spent three years in a private law practice in Philadelphia before joining the FBI in 1996. Professional career McCabe as speaking in 2015 McCabe began his FBI career in the New York Field Office in 1996. While there, he was on the SWAT team. In 2003, he began work as a supervisory special agent at the Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force. Later, McCabe held management positions in the FBI Counterterrorism Division, the FBI National Security Branch and the FBI's Washington Field Office. In 2009, he served as the first director of the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, a program to research interrogation techniques that was created after the Department of Defense Directive 2310 ban of waterboarding and other interrogation techniques. McCabe was part of the investigation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. McCabe secured the arrest of Ahmed Abu Khattala for suspected involvement in the 2012 Benghazi attack. FBI Director James Comey appointed McCabe as Deputy Director of the FBI on January 29, 2016, and he assumed those duties on February 1, 2016. Crossfire Hurricane, Jeff Sessions investigation, and James Comey's termination On July 31, 2016, the FBI opened its Crossfire Hurricane investigation into whether the Trump campaign was collaborating with the Russian government. Both Comey and McCabe were briefed on the Investigation. After Trump was elected, he was also briefed on the investigation. In March 2018, it was reported that, upon receiving a referral from Congress in 2017, McCabe had authorized a criminal investigation into whether Sessions had lied to Congress in 2017 about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak; the investigation was later closed. On May 9, 2017, McCabe became acting director of the FBI after Trump dismissed Comey as director. In the absence of a Senate-confirmed director, the deputy director automatically becomes acting director. Statute allows the president to choose an interim FBI director (acting director) outside of the standard order of succession. That process began on May 10, 2017, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein interviewed four candidates to serve as interim FBI director. Sessions said that McCabe was \\"also under consideration\\". Shortly after Trump fired Comey, McCabe visited the White House for an introductory meeting in the Oval Office with the president, during which time the president reportedly asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 election. However, no interim director was named, and McCabe remained as Acting Director. Christopher A. Wray was ultimately nominated as the new Director on June 7, 2017 and confirmed on August 1, 2017, at which point McCabe reverted to his position as Deputy Director. In a February 2019 interview with Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes McCabe said that, during the days after Comey was fired, he ordered the probe of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, taking action to protect the Russian-interference investigation from successors who might terminate it, because he or Robert Mueller could be removed from their positions. He said \\"I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision.\\" McCabe also had concerns about whether Trump \\"had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests\\" causing \\"the highest levels of American law enforcement [to try] to figure out what to do with the president\\", including the possibility of advocating Vice Presidential and Cabinet use of the 25th Amendment to have Trump suspended from office, and ultimately removed by Congress. Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who had previously been reported but denied having discussed such matters with his colleagues, denied McCabe's assertion as \\"inaccurate and factually incorrect\\". McCabe's revelation prompted Senate Judiciary Chairman, Chuck Grassley, to promise investigation of the claims. Wall Street Journal articles and aftermath McCabe speaking in 2016 The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published on October 23‚Äì4, 2016, regarding an investigation of the Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, suggesting that McCabe had a potential conflict of interest caused by donations to his wife's campaign as a Democrat for the Virginia State Senate. On October 24, 2016, the WSJ reporter emailed an FBI official following up on McCabe's involvement in the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation which had begun in 2015. Four FBI field offices ‚Äî New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock ‚Äî were pursuing the investigation, with some field agents advocating that it be aggressively continued, while some supervisors and prosecutors believed there was insufficient evidence and that the investigation was too expansive. In July 2016, McCabe decided that the New York FBI office would continue investigating, with assistance from Little Rock. The Journal reported that a senior Justice Department official called McCabe to express his disagreement with this decision, with McCabe reportedly asking, \\"Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?\\" to which the unnamed official replied, \\"Of course not.\\" The contents of this phone call was included in the follow-up article that was published on October 30, 2016. Although the existence of the FBI's investigation in the Clinton Foundation had been leaked, the FBI up until that point had not officially confirmed the investigation. In January 2017, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee investigated McCabe over concerns that he should have recused himself from the investigation of the Clinton email scandal. The investigation ceased one year later, in January 2018, with the release of FBI documents showing that McCabe had followed FBI protocol regarding potential conflicts of interest. In 2015, before his wife ran for political office in Virginia, McCabe had notified the FBI about his wife's plans and consulted with the FBI about how he would avoid a conflict of interest. McCabe did not oversee the Clinton email server probe while his wife was running for office, and he was excluded from FBI investigations into public corruption cases in Virginia. According to USA Today, \\"the internal documents, published on the FBI's website, support what the bureau has asserted previously: that McCabe had no conflicts when he assumed oversight of the Clinton investigation. His role began in February 2016, following his appointment as deputy director and three months after his wife, Jill McCabe, lost her bid for a state Senate seat.\\" However, starting in July 2017 while McCabe was the acting Director, Trump repeatedly attacked McCabe in Twitter comments, suggesting that Sessions should dismiss McCabe because of the potential conflicts being investigated, and taunting McCabe about \\"racing the clock\\" until his retirement. In May 2017, an investigation by the FBI Inspection Division into the leaks regarding the investigation in the Clinton Foundation was expanded to include the leak of the contents of the phone call that was published on October 30, 2016. McCabe was interviewed twice by the Inspection Division, in May and August 2017, and the conflicting information in those interviews, led the OIG to open an investigation in late August 2017.https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/us/politics/20180413a-doj-oig-mccabe- report.pdf This was a separate investigation from the ongoing one for conflict of interest. Political pressure In January, 2018, the Nunes memo, which alleges improper activities in seeking a warrant to surveil former Trump associate Carter Page, was prepared by the House Intelligence Committee. It asserted that McCabe \\"testified before the [House Intelligence] Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier\\", a document many Trump supporters insist is completely false. However, McCabe's testimony was in classified session and no public transcript is available to confirm the Nunes memo assertion; disclosing contents of the classified testimony would be unlawful. Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo \\"seriously mischaracterizes the testimony of Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\\" The Nunes memo also asserts that a text message from Peter Strzok discusses \\"a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an 'insurance' policy against President Trump's election\\". However, The Wall Street Journal reported on December 18, 2017, that Strzok associates said the \\"insurance policy\\" meant the FBI continuing its investigation into possible collusion between Trump and Russians, in case Trump won the election. By January 2018, it was also reported that Attorney General Sessions had been pressuring FBI Director Wray to fire McCabe. However, Wray refused and reportedly threatened to resign if McCabe was removed. In February 2018, the OIG finished its second investigation into the FBI leaks. The result of the investigation was: \\"As detailed in this report, the OIG found that then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions in connection with describing his role in connection with a disclosure to the WSJ, and that this conduct violated FBI Offense Codes 2.5 and 2.6. The OIG also concluded that McCabe‚Äôs disclosure of the existence of an ongoing investigation in the manner described in this report violated the FBI‚Äôs and the Department‚Äôs media policy and constituted misconduct.\\" The report was not publicly released for another two months, but on March 1, 2018 The New York Times and The Washington Post, stated the report concluded that McCabe was \\"responsible for approving an improper media disclosure\\", relating to the October 2016 WSJ article that reported on disagreements between the FBI and Justice Department over an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. In regards to the Crossfire Hurricane Investigation, the Justice Department inspector general report published on December 9, 2019 did not find McCabe engaged in politically biased actions against Trump. After the report was published, McCabe said being accused of treason and being subject to years of personal attacks from Trump was \\"quite honestly terrifying\\", particularly as Trump had insinuated the proper punishment should be the death penalty. Resignation and firing After meeting with Director Wray concerning the pending OIG report on the 2016 leaks and a possible demotion, McCabe announced on January 29, 2018, that he was stepping down as deputy director, effective immediately. He then went on paid leave until his scheduled retirement date of March 18, 2018, his 50th birthday, at which point he would be eligible for a retirement pension. McCabe did not lose his entire pension. On March 14, 2018, it was reported the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, citing the inspector general's conclusions, had recommended that McCabe be fired, although McCabe had been notified of the recommendation on March 8. According to Office of Personnel Management regulations, McCabe was entitled to a 30-day notice prior to dismissal, however that period could have been shortened to seven days if there is reasonable cause to believe an imprisonable crime was committed. Attorney General Sessions announced at 10 p.m. on Friday, March 16, 2018, that he was taking the recommendation and firing McCabe, eight days after he had been notified of the recommendation to fire him. He cited the inspector general's report, which had not yet been publicly released, saying that \\"Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor ‚Äî including under oath ‚Äî on multiple occasions.\\" McCabe told The New York Times, \\"The idea that I was dishonest is just wrong. This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.\\" It was unclear if Sessions knew at the time he fired McCabe that McCabe had authorized the criminal investigation of him in 2017. McCabe was dismissed less than two days before he would have collected a full early pension for his FBI career. He may have to wait until age 57‚Äì62 to begin collecting pension benefits. Trump immediately celebrated on Twitter, saying \\"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI ‚Äî A great day for Democracy.\\" On March 17, Democratic Congressman Mark Pocan of Wisconsin offered McCabe a security post in his congressional office. With McCabe short by two days of work for a federal agency to receive his benefits, Pocan said that \\"Andrew McCabe's firing makes it clear that President Trump is doing everything he can to discredit the FBI and undermine the Special Counsel's investigation\\" and described his job offer as a \\"legitimate offer to work on election security\\". Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton was also reported to be considering offering McCabe a position in his office. On March 21, 2018, FBI Director Christopher Wray stated that McCabe's firing was not politically influenced but done \\"by the book\\". Also on March 21, immediately after McCabe's firing, a parallel situation was noted and reported: that just as Jeff Sessions had fired McCabe for lacking \\"candor\\", McCabe had, nearly a year previous to his own firing, authorized a criminal investigation into \\"whether Sessions lacked candor when testifying before Congress about contacts with Russian operatives\\". On March 29, 2018, McCabe opened up a Go Fund Me site to collect money for the legal costs arising from defending himself from the various investigations. The site raised $213,000 in five hours, and by the time it was shut down on April 2, 2019, had raised more than $538,000. On April 13, the OIG report was released to Congress and obtained by the Associated Press, which then published it. McCabe issued a response to the report, disputing its conclusions. The report found that McCabe lied to or misled federal investigators at least four times, with three of these instances occurring while he was under oath. The report also stated that his approval of disclosures to the media was within his power, but was a policy violation because it was done \\"in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of Department leadership\\". McCabe's lawyer Michael R. Bromwich responded that the investigation and report had been politicized by pressure from Trump, and announced that McCabe intended to sue the Trump administration and senior officials for \\"wrongful termination, defamation, Constitutional violations and more\\". McCabe filed suit in August 2019. In September 2020, federal district court judge Randy Moss denied a Justice Department motion to dismiss the suit, allowing the case to proceed to the discovery phase. Legal proceedings On March 19, 2018, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) with the FBI requesting documents related to McCabe's termination. The FBI said it would post the documents on its website, but failed to do so. Instead, beginning in July 2018, the Justice Department brought the case before a grand jury attempting to indict McCabe for his actions outlined in the OIG report released in April, 2018. False statements made during the course of internal DOJ investigations (administrative investigations) are typically punished by administrative discipline, rather than criminal prosecutions, and McCabe's attorneys asserted he was being singled out. The grand jury apparently declined to indict McCabe, and in September 2019 former DOJ inspector general Michael Bromwich, representing McCabe, wrote a letter to Jessie Liu, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, stating \\"It is clear that no indictment has been returned\\" by the grand jury, based on press reports and a discussion he'd had with the prosecutors involved in the case, Joseph Cooney and Molly Gaston. Such an outcome would be highly unusual, as grand juries return indictments for nearly all cases brought to them. Consequently, a failure to secure a grand jury indictment‚Äîwhich may require only a simple majority decision based solely on evidence presented by the government‚Äîcould prove embarrassing to the DOJ, as it suggests the government's case could not win a unanimous trial jury verdict. McCabe's attorneys asserted the DOJ should drop the investigation if the grand jury did not return an indictment. The New York Times reported that two prosecutors on the case had recently left the DOJ, which is unusual in a case nearing an indictment, with one of the attorneys expressing reservations about the merits of the DOJ case. The Times also noted political undertones of the case, as McCabe had authorized the investigation into whether President Trump had obstructed justice, and as a result he had become a frequent target of Trump's ire. McCabe filed a wrongful termination suit against the DOJ in August 2019, asserting his firing was intended to remove officials who had been deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump. In August 2019, McCabe filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the DOJ, saying his firing, which took effect only hours before his scheduled retirement, was the result of improper political interference by the president. His suit says he is \\"entitled to his full law enforcement pension and all other benefits, privileges, and rights currently being withheld\\". Also in August 2019, McCabe was hired by CNN as contributor, drawing criticism from media critics and conservatives. In early 2019, Attorney General Bill Barr assigned prosecutor John Durham to conduct an inquiry into the origins of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. On September 30, 2019, it was reported that Durham had offered McCabe a plea deal that McCabe had rejected. McCabe and his attorneys denied having been offered the plea deal. In a court proceeding the same day Federal Judge Reggie B. Walton heard arguments stemming from a July 30, 2018 lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington because the FBI had been unresponsive to its March FOIA. The DOJ had requested an exemption from the FOIA because \\"records or information could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.‚Äù Judge Walton told federal prosecutors that they needed to either file charges against McCabe or drop the investigation, saying \\"This is just dragging too long.\\" The judge gave prosecutors a November 15, 2019 deadline to file charges, saying he would order the release of the documents after that date if no charges had been filed. In a November 14, 2019 hearing, Walton excoriated prosecutors, suggesting they were stalling a decision whether to charge McCabe by using a \\"smoke screen\\" to deceive the judge and continue the hold on the release of the documents, which he released. In December 2019, Trump nominated the DOJ official with oversight on the case, Liu, to serve as an undersecretary in the Treasury Department. The next month Liu determined there was insufficient evidence to indict McCabe, and on February 1, 2020, she was transferred to the Treasury Department to await her confirmation, as Barr replaced her with his close advisor Timothy Shea. Hearings for the confirmation were scheduled to begin on February 14. On February 11, Trump abruptly withdrew her nomination and she resigned from the government the next day. On February 14, 2020, the DOJ advised McCabe's attorneys that he would not be prosecuted. Later that day, The Hill stated: \\"(S)ome have questioned whether the decision Friday to drop possible charges is an attempt to quell controversy surrounding the Justice Department's recommended sentencing for longtime Trump aide Roger Stone, which was reduced after complaints by the president.\\" and also quoted McCabe himself, who stated: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be free of this President and his maniacal rage that he‚Äôs directed towards me and my wife since October of 2016 for absolutely no reason whatsoever,\\"https://thehill.com/policy/national- security/fbi/483215-mccabe-i-dont-think-i-will-be-ever-be-free-of-this- president-In a February 15, 2020 tweet, Trump stated: \\"IG RECOMMENDED MCCABE‚ÄôS FIRING\\" The OIG made no such recommendation, having stated at the end of its report: \\"The OIG is issuing this report to the FBI for such action that it deems to be appropriate.\\" Personal life McCabe is married to Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, who was a Democratic candidate for the Virginia state Senate in 2015. They have two children, a son and a daughter. He is a triathlete who biked to work from his home in Virginia.

Thai Fabric is hand-woven fabric produced in Thailand. It is a cultural heritage and unique culture to the Thai culture and now has been famous throughout the world. Background of Thai fabrics Thai people known weaving since prehistoric. Culture and society in the countryside is regarded as weaving is a woman's leisure after her main job, rice planting or farming. This is common to all regions of the country. Product development, design, pattern and color of the fabric inherited a weaver's imagination and the influence of other factors. Thai fabrics is a core material in a cloth and it is indicative of social status including position of the wearer in society. Hence, weaving can classify three main types for people. The first type for public people or citizen. The whole fabric used in daily life and the fabric used on special occasions related to the faith traditions such as fabrics religious ceremony, carnival, festival and important ceremonies. The second type for privileged class, royalty and majesty. This type used a significant fabric such as the ancient embroidered cloth and different extraordinary types of fabric. And the third type for monk and Buddhist Scriptures. Thai fabric has many styles and local identity in each region which has evolved over many generations, such as: * The 14th ‚Äì 16th century AD - The Northern Thailand is the location of The Lan Na or Lanna Kingdom. They said that the Lanna people are skilled in weaving, particularly cotton. There is weaving widespread to distribute to the neighboring kingdom. The colorful of cottons in this era are extremely outstanding. * The Kingdom of Sukhothai - Around 755 years ago, The Sukhothai weaved both cotton and silk fabrics. And especially cotton called \\"Benjarong Cotton\\" is a traditional Thai five-colored famous cotton in the Rattanakosin period. The general public is use a common cotton whereas a top grade cotton is used in royal court that has royal tailors and some of fabric order from abroad such as silk, satin from China. Moreover, fabrics are used to decorate houses or made products, for instance mattresses, pillows, curtains, etc. * Ayutthaya Kingdom - Around 400 years ago, fabrics are important in the trade and economic in the country, it is also used as currency instead money. King used them for reward or maybe the royal salary per year which is embroidered clothes and woven with silk and the center is patterned by fabric. For the general public, men often use loincloth and Commer band (Kamar band in Persian language) and women wear shawl. * Early Rattanakosin Kingdom - Local weaving in Thailand has spread to almost all regions, but there are specially the Northeast and the North of Thailand. The pattern of the fabric will vary based on ideology, beliefs and traditions of each ethnic group. Thai fabrics in regions of Thailand The local Thai fabrics were divided by region. * Fabrics in the north of Thailand Woven fabrics in the north of Thailand or Lanna kingdom, but nowadays they are Chiang Rai, Phayao, Nan, Phrae, Lampang, Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son and some of the land in Myanmar, China and Laos. Tai Yuan people of Thailand in the past had their own culture, they use of fabric since weaving, creating the pattern and wearing. For example, men would wear such apparel hiked through thigh to show off a tattoo above the knee up to the thigh, and they did not wear shirt or T-shirt but had a fabric across the shoulders, meanwhile elite wear shirt and cummerbund. Women wear Sinhs or Lao skirt fabric striped body. It has a linear pattern and, they wore a fabric chest strap instead shirt. And often have hair bun in the middle of the head, and then pin connector pins or flowers. This dress also appeared on the mural paintings, such as the mural paintings at Wat Phra Sing Waramahavihan in Chiang Mai. * Fabrics in the northeast of Thailand In general, the northeast has a farming social. Most major occupation is farming. It takes about 7 ‚Äì 9 months from planting until harvest in each year throughout the rainy season and winter. In summer time is about 3 ‚Äì 5 months, the northeast will spare time to prepare equipment and tools used in everyday life includes the tradition of philanthropy and relaxation. This is the cycle of life in the every year. Local fabrics in the northeast are well known since ancient times. There are two types of woven fabrics from cotton and silk. Nevertheless, they bring polyester mixed such as thread and Toray silk. This is characterized by native weaving same people are doing every step. Since cotton planting and mulberry planting (Mulberry in Thailand) to feed silkworms. Remove the cocoons to the line until they purify and dyed cotton. * Fabrics in the central of Thailand Immigration Tai - Laos to settle in various localities in the central region. As a result, they dispersed among various places. Most of these communities are still woven fabric for clothing like typical and popular tradition handed down since predecessors. There are important local weaving, for instance the Tai Puan weaving group, in Sukhothai Tai province and the Tai Puan from Laos. In the era of King Rama III, some groups have dispersed settlements in some areas of the province of Suphan Buri, Maha Sarakham and so on. The central region has woven fabrics in many local authorities. But when the industry into the weaving. Many local weaving decays. Although some are still woven together in a way, but the pattern is often changed to meet the needs of consumers. The pattern of fabric in central of Thailand. * Fabrics in the south of Thailand Movement of people from political. Not only Muslims, but Malay moving settlers in the provinces in the South. And the family had to move into Thailand some settlements in a land which originally belonged to Thailand by such communities were evacuated to Thailand in Kelantan and Thairaburi. This behavior can cause the mixture of races ago. Also caused by a combination of cultural pressure. The weaving of Southern culture. Firstly begins to Nakhon Si Thammarat and then it spread to the other.

He had an emotionally hurtful event in his life, which led him to write his feelings down, creating them into lyrics, and producing his first song the same night. From then on he started writing about life-altering moments, to humorous and witty lyricism as the foundation of his music.http://kollaboration.org/artist/mike-b/ Career Talented producer and close friend of Mike B., Matt Merisola (aka LoDef), produced many of Mike's music and as a team have worked together to unveil the unique album \\"Dear Michael, You‚Äôre Welcome\\". (Released nationwide, 12.12.12) The collaboration of the innovative fuse of hip-hop, electronic, and soul-jazz beats that are carefully pieced together by LoDef and the versatile yet relatable lyricism that Mike B. offers only one result to the outcome. Mike B.'s first solo project prior to this album was his mix tape album; \\"Better Late Than Never.\\" This project's focus was to express his personal emotions and the enthusiasm he had and still has for music. With the great outcomes of the first album, Mike B. was driven by success and passion to continue his dream to be an artist. Although both albums may seem to have the same focal point, Mike B.'s newest album is definitely a story to hear through his music. This album includes a lot more of Mike B.'s song-writing forte, where he was able to incorporate them into the hooks of his tracks. There are also featured artists like, Breezy Lovejoy, Jazz & The Giant, and Toestah. \\"Dear Michael, You‚Äôre Welcome\\", contains 12 songs that tell a journey of Mike B. and his constant battle with his passion to pursue his music career but sacrifice time with the family and friends that support him through his trek. In 2013, Mike B. was a performer and finalist in Kollaboration, a performing arts organization with an annual showcase produced by a diverse group of students and working professionals. He believed that there was not many platforms for Asian Americans in the entertainment industry as pop culture has not fully accepted them. Being an Asian American and recently becoming an independent artist, he auditioned for Kollaboration in hopes to showcase his talent and get his name and music out to the public. Style and influences In an interview, he mentioned that he listens to a wide array of different genres such as jazz, acoustic, R&B;, electronic, and indie rather than just hip hop. As far as individuals, he said he received influence from artist such as Jay Z, Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Pharrell Williams, John Mayer, and Frank Ocean.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMAy5aptGwY In another interview he stated that being born and raised in Los Angeles, California, he had a big west coast influence listening to artists such as Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8b0PaVKbew Mike B., like other hip hop artists, has a lyrical flow, but also slows it down which has a big appeal to R&B; fans.

Description The appearance of this animal was vaguely similar to that of a particularly robust, large felid, but the skull resembles that of a canid or an ursid, like that of many amphicyonids. Unlike most other amphicyonids, Magericyon had teeth associated with those of a hypercarnivore, with laterally flattened canines, the third premolar having a single root, the absence of second premolars and a metaconid on its lower molars, with a reduction in the second upper molar. The scapula and the front leg showed primitive features such as an acromion in the shoulder with a reduced caudoventral projection and post scapular pit.Peign√©, S., Salesa, M. J., Ant√≥n, M. & Morales, J., 2008: A new amphicyonine (Carnivora: Amphicyonidae) from the upper Miocene of Batallones-1, Madrid, Spain. Palaeontology: Vol. 51, #4, pp. 943Siliceo, G., Salesa, M. J., Ant√≥n, M., Pastor, J. F., Morales, J. 2015. Comparative Anatomy of the Shoulder Region in the Late Miocene Amphicyonid Magericyon anceps (Carnivora): Functional and Paleoecological Inferences. Journal of Mammalian Evolution, 22: 243‚Äì258. Magericyon was roughly equivalent to a large leopard in size, weighing around . Classification Magericyon was described for the first time in 2008, based on fossils found in Cerro de los Batallones in Spain. The type species is Magericyon anceps, but a second species has also been attributed to the genus as M. castellanus, described in 1981 and initially attributed to the genus Amphicyon. Magericyon is part of the family of amphicyonidae, a group of very common carnivores ranging from the Eocene to the Miocene, and which occupied many different ecological niches. Magericyon is the last amphicyonid known from Western Europe, but its features are mixed; on one hand the teeth were very specialized, while on the other, front limb and morphology of the scapula was more primitive. Evidence also indicates that Magericyon was closely related to Amphicyon. Paleobiology Magericyon occupied a different ecological niche than other amphicyonids, such as the larger Amphicyon and Ysengrinia (which had lifestyles more akin to bears) or Daphoenodon and Temnocyon of North America, which were more capable runners. Magericyon probably lived in a similar manner to that of modern felines, being an ambush hunter of large prey. Studies by Gemo Siliceo et al also revealed that Magericyon had powerful jaw and neck muscles that helped to stabilize its head and jaws during a bite. The amphicyonid was particularly adept at side- to-side movements and rotations of the head. This feature allowed Magericyon to swiftly and efficiently process the meat on a carcass, allowing the bear- dog to devour sufficient amounts of flesh before scavengers arrived to steal the predator's hard-earned meal. Paleoecology As a carnivore at Cerro de los Battalones, Magericyon shared the apex predator position with two saber- toothed cat species, the leopard-sized Promegantereon ogygia and the tiger- sized Machairodus aphanistus. Evidence indicates that the large carnivores may have co-existed using niche partitioning. A carbon-13 bone analysis matched isotope profiles in prey species with their predators, showing both cats hunted prey that typically live in closed woodland habitats, such as pigs (Microstonyx) and perhaps occasionally young of the gomphotheriid mastodonTetralophodon. Magericyon ate medium-sized prey that live in more open habitats, with the antelope Austroportax being an important food source and hipparionine horses also present in the diet. Because the site attracted all three species as a predator trap, Magericyon must also have taken carrion or injured animals of various kinds, though its teeth show it was specialized as a hypercarnivore without the bone-cracking adaptations of many other bear- dogs. Magericyon may have competed at times with large omnivorous bears such as Agriotherium and Indarctos, but these genera focused more on vegetable food. As well as Austroportax and Hipparion, its prey could have included young of the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium and possibly the calves of the large silvatherid giraffes and boselaphine antelopes. Since its choice of prey suggests life in open country, but its legs were not designed for speed, Magericyon probably would have wasted no time in stealing a meal from any of the smaller carnivores in the region or in scavenging when the opportunity presented itself.
