In Second International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR (Vol. 19). for modeling the pixel intensities of natural images. As such, it defines a proper probabilistic counterpart for the commonly used binary cross entropy loss, which is often applied to continuous, [0,1]-valued data.Larsen, A. B. L., Sønderby, S. K., Larochelle, H., & Winther, O. (2016, June). Autoencoding beyond pixels using a learned similarity metric. In International conference on machine learning (pp. 1558-1566).Jiang, Z., Zheng, Y., Tan, H., Tang, B., & Zhou, H. (2017, August). Variational deep embedding: an unsupervised and generative approach to clustering.

This practice amounts to ignoring the normalizing constant of the continuous Bernoulli distribution, since the binary cross entropy loss only defines a true log- likelihood for discrete, {0,1}-valued data. The continuous Bernoulli also defines an exponential family of distributions. Writing \\\\eta = \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\lambda/(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\right) for the natural parameter, the density can be rewritten in canonical form: p(x  \\\\eta) \\\\propto \\\\exp (\\\\eta x) .  Related distributions = Bernoulli distribution  The continuous Bernoulli can be thought of as a continuous relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution, which is defined on the discrete set {0,1} by the probability mass function: : p(x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}, where p is a scalar parameter between 0 and 1. Applying this same functional form on the continuous interval [0,1] results in the continuous Bernoulli probability density function, up to a normalizing constant.  Beta distribution  The Beta distribution has the density function: : p(x) \\\\propto x^{\\\\alpha - 1} (1-x)^{\\\\beta - 1}, which can be re-written as: : p(x) \\\\propto x_1^{\\\\alpha_1 - 1} x_2^{\\\\alpha_2 - 1}, where \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 are positive scalar parameters, and (x_1, x_2) represents an arbitrary point inside the 1-simplex, \\\\Delta^{1} = { (x_1, x_2): x_1 > 0, x_2 > 0, x_1 + x_2 = 1 } . Switching the role of the parameter and the argument in this density function, we obtain: : p(x) \\\\propto \\\\alpha_1^{x_1} \\\\alpha_2^{x_2}. This family is only identifiable up to the linear constraint \\\\alpha_1 + \\\\alpha_2 = 1 , whence we obtain: : p(x) \\\\propto \\\\lambda^{x_1} (1-\\\\lambda)^{x_2}, corresponding exactly to the continuous Bernoulli density.  Exponential distribution  An exponential distribution restricted to the unit interval is equivalent to a continuous Bernoulli distribution with appropriate parameter.  Continuous categorical distribution  The multivariate generalization of the continuous Bernoulli is called the continuous categorical.Gordon-Rodriguez, E., Loaiza- Ganem, G., & Cunningham, J. P.

It was convoked by the Armenian catholicos John of Odzun and attended by many Armenian bishops and six bishops of the Syriac church sent by Patriarch Athanasius III. It took place in Manzikert (Manazkert).Krzysztof Stopka, Armenia Christiana: Armenian Religious Identity and the Churches of Constantinople and Rome (4th–15th century) (Jagiellonian University Press, 2016), pp. 89–91.Edward Mathews, Armenian Commentary on Genesis Attributed to Ephrem the Syrian (Peeters, 1998), p. xlvii–xlviii. Both the Armenian church and the Syriac were miaphysite in their theology and rejected the Council of Chalcedon (451). In the canons of the council, the Armenians anathematized both the aphthartodocetists (who believed that Jesus' body was incorruptible) and the followers of Severus of Antioch (who held a contrary doctrine) in favour of the moderate formulation of Cyril of Alexandria. The council formally withdrew the Armenian church from communion with the Greek Orthodox church. It affirmed that Christ was true God, only-begotten Son, a single hypostasis and a single nature of the incarnate Word. While his human body was capable of pain and suffering, \\"of his divine nature he was above suffering\\". This formulation was arguably consistent with Chalcedon. The council also addressed the rise of the Paulicians.Simon Payaslian, The History of Armenia: From the Origins to the Present (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), p. 56. The Syriac church, which disagreed with many distinctive Armenian customs, was not entirely pleased with the outcome at Manzikert, but accepted communion with the Armenians nonetheless. The canons of Manzikert are often credited with confirming the Armenian church in its distinctive non-Chalcedonian theology and setting it apart from other churches. After the council, Armenian Chalcedonism was suppressed.

She was an apprentice to George Collie RHA for 2 years and then attended the National College of Art and Design, graduating in 1969 before moving to Coventry, England where she continued her studies in fine art and set up a studio with sculptor John Letts. She returned to Ireland in 1981, moving to Ballylickey, near Bantry in County Cork, where she established the Rynhart Fine Art gallery and workshop. Rynhart and her husband, Derek Rynhart, had 2 children: a daughter, Audrey, and a son, Barry. Career Rynhart created the Molly Malone statue for the 1988 Dublin Millennium celebrations. The statue was controversial at the time of its unveiling due to the revealing dress the statue wore. Registrar of Aosdána, Adrian Munnelly wrote to the An Bord Fáilte criticising it. The statue was defended by the Lord Mayor of Dublin Ben Briscoe. Rynhart herself wrote in The Irish Times that the clothing and appearance were accurate for women of that era. The statue has since become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Dublin and is fondly regarded by locals. Rynhart also sculpted a statue commemorating the original Rose of Tralee, Mary O'Connor, which stands in Tralee Town Park. In 1993, she produced 2 statues in honour of Annie Moore at Cobh Heritage Centre in Cork and Ellis Island in New York City. The Ellis Island statue was dedicated by the then-President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. In 1994, Rynhart's daughter Audrey joined the business.

Matthew McKnight was a criminal prosecution of Matthew McKnight on thirteen charges of sexual assault between 2010 and 2016. On 10 August 2016, Matthew McKnight was charged with two counts of sexual assault, one count of sexual assault causing bodily harm, and one count of unlawful confinement. Following a public statement from the Edmonton Police Service, more complainants emerged. On 16 January 2020, McKnight was found guilty on five of thirteen counts of sexual assault. The case drew considerable public attention in Canada due to the fact that McKnight was a prominent entrepreneur and promoter at several nightlife establishments in the City of Edmonton including Oil City Roadhouse and the Old Strathcona Rack. The Globe and Mail referred to the trial as \\"the first major Canadian case of the #MeToo era.\\"  Prosecution attorneys  R v. Matthew McKnight was prosecuted by Mark Huyser-Wierenga and Katherine Fraser. The Globe and Mail described Huyser-Wierenga as \\"one of the city’s most senior Crown prosecutors\\" and Fraser as \\"a young lawyer with an interest in sexual-assault prosecutions.\\" Mark Huyser-Wierenga was called to the Bar of Alberta in 1989 and has worked the majority of his career in the Family Protection Unit within the Edmonton Crown Prosecutors’ Office, primarily prosecuting cases involving adult victims of domestic violence and child victims of sexual abuse. The Globe and Mail stated that \\"although Huyser-Wierenga was an experienced lawyer, the McKnight trial would be one of the largest and most complex of his career.\\"  Defence attorneys  Lawyers Dino Bottos and Peter Sankoff defended the accused. The Globe and Mail referred to Bottos as \\"a prominent defence lawyer who’d been involved in a number of controversial and high-profile cases, including representing Bradley Barton in the death of Cindy Gladue in 2011.\\"  Judge  The Honourable Doreen A. Sulyma was selected as judge. Sulyma graduated from the University of Alberta Faculty of Law in 1975.  Pre-trial  On 15 August 2016, McKnight was released from the Edmonton provincial law courts on $20,000 bail with conditions that he was to stay home from 21:00h each night until 7:00h the following morning. Additionally McKnight was prohibited from frequenting any businesses that serve alcohol and he was to regularly meet with an assigned police officer. Initially there were 26 charges of sexual and physical assault from 21 different victims; however, some of the complainants decided they did not want to continue legal proceedings, and there were other charges on which the Crown decided not to proceed. Additionally, the Globe and Mail stated that \\"one woman couldn’t be located, and two cases would be heard separately.\\" Thus McKnight was only tried on 13 of the original 26 charges.  Jury selection  The trial of Matthew McKnight initially had a jury of 12 jurors; however, in the Globe and Mail, Jana G. Pruden wrote that \\"by the time closing arguments began in January, the McKnight trial had gone more than a month longer than planned, and the jury was down to 10. Losing another juror could put the case in serious jeopardy and even cause a mistrial.\\"  Prosecution's case  The prosecution questioned the accuracy of McKnight's memory; McKnight vividly described minute details of events that had taken place sometimes more than half a decade prior. Additionally, the Crown asked how McKnight could have \\"been struck by lightning 13 times,\\" employing a metaphor for the 13 complainants. The Globe and Mail summarized that \\"the women didn’t know each other and had no connection to McKnight or any apparent reason to make up accusations about him. Many immediately told friends, family or boyfriends, and some searched for information about date-rape drugs, called the police or initiated sexual-assault examinations in the hours and days after leaving his apartment, even if they ultimately decided not to proceed.\\"  Defence's case  The Globe and Mail wrote that defence lawyer Dino Bottos \\"went over and over how many drinks [the complainants] had, what they said or didn’t say in earlier statements, questioning every detail they recalled and didn’t. He asked them about their lives, their bodies, even whether it was possible they showed signs of arousal that McKnight could have construed as consent. He zeroed in on gaps in their memories and inconsistencies in their stories, pulling at each detail and thread, picking at small holes until they gaped and glared.\\"  Expert witness testimony  Expert witnesses were called by the Crown including RCMP toxicologist Gillian Sayer and multiple sexual- assault nurse examiners. Sayer testified about the effects of the date rape drug GHB, specifically discussing memory loss, blackouts, and physical impairment.  Closing arguments  In a longform piece in the Globe and Mail, Jana G. Pruden stated that the Crown's closing arguments \\"urged the jury to believe the women. Any inconsistencies or lapses in memory, they said, were entirely consistent with people who had experienced trauma and who were drinking and, in some cases, drugged. They argued the detailed and impeccable recollections of McKnight and his friends were not believable and were fabricated around the women’s testimony at the preliminary hearing.\\" In contrast, the defence stated \\"went again through each allegation in minute detail. He argued a woman who had been telling people in the bar scene that McKnight drugged and raped women had become “patient zero” in a dangerous rumour, which exploded in the #MeToo environment, fuelled by gossip, social- media mobs and a shoddy police investigation. He said the announcement of the first three charges established McKnight as a threat and that the women who came forward after that were either lying or recasting their experiences, having 'buyer’s remorse' about an encounter with a man now publicly accused of being a predator.\\"  Jury instructions  Jana G. Pruden reported that the jury was instructed on \\"myths and stereotypes around sexual assault,\\" and told that \\"factors such as how someone was dressed and what they did or didn’t do after the assault are no longer acceptable ways to discredit someone. It is to be accepted that there’s no one way a 'real victim' would act.\\"  Jury verdict  The jury found Matthew McKnight guilty of five charges and not guilty of the other eight charges.  Sentencing  Matthew McKnight’s sentencing hearing began on 8 July 2020. The crown sought 22.5 years in jail. The defence presented their argument the week of 12 July 2020 arguing for five to nine years in jail. On 31 July 2020 McKnight was sentenced to eight years in jail.  Public response  Edmonton Journal columnist Jonny Wakefield stated that \\"McKnight's case was Edmonton's highest-profile sexual assault trial of the Me Too era.\\" Following the announcement of the guilty verdict, communication scientist Kristen Hedley responded via Twitter, asking \\"Am I missing something? Why hasn't anyone in the #yegmedia asked Urban Sparq Hospitality to make a comment re: Matthew McKnight's guilty verdict? Don't tell me that a culture of complicity wasn't a factor in the number of women impacted by this case.\\" In July 2020, the Globe and Mail's Jana G. Pruden called the trial of Matthew McKnight \\"the first major Canadian case of the #MeToo era\\" and John Doyle referred to Pruden's profile of the case as a \\"must read... superb.\\"  See also  * Me Too movement  References  *  External links  *Court documents and evidence **R v.

Early life and career  Toussaint grew up on Long Island, New York where he was raised by his father, Martial, a machinist mate in the Navy, and his mother, Judith, a doctorate in education. As a child, Toussaint was sent to Wentworth Military Academy & College in Lexington, Missouri from the sixth grade due to \\"behavioral issues.\\" Toussaint attended college at New England Institute of Technology, where he studied audio and video production. After a year and a half, someone broke into his car, sending him on an emotional spiral that resulted in him dropping out of college. He found a job as a maintenance worker at a Flywheel cycling studio in East Hampton, New York. He had never been on a spin bike before, but was able to observe how the instructors taught their classes. Eventually, Toussaint asked Flywheel co-founder Ruth Zukerman for an instructor audition. It was through her mentorship that he transitioned into the role of a spin instructor at their East Hampton studio. and would also teach in their Manhattan and Dubai studios. In late 2015, he was approached by Peloton to join their team of spin instructors after Peloton's chief content officer, Fred Klein, took one of Toussaint's classes at Flywheel and was struck by his instructing style and deep voice.

It is located on the fourth floor of 29 Olof Palme Street () in the central Stockholm district of Norrmalm, across from Norra Bantorget. Although the current embassy dates from 2020, the Philippines also maintained a previous resident embassy in Sweden between 1978 and 2012. History Prior to its closure in 2012, the Philippine Embassy in Stockholm was located at Skeppsbron 20 in Gamla stan The Philippines did not initially open a resident mission in Sweden when diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on January 17, 1947. An honorary consulate was first opened in 1970, and on November 9, 1978, Jose E. Stilianapolous, then Philippine Ambassador to the United Kingdom, was accredited as the first non-resident Philippine ambassador to Sweden. The first physical resident embassy opened around a week later, headed by chargé d'affaires Rolando Libas, in Gamla stan, Stockholm's old town. In 1982, Consuelo Arranz was appointed as the first resident Philippine ambassador to Sweden, serving until 1986. The Philippine Embassy in Stockholm at the time was the first Philippine diplomatic mission in the Nordic states, and when it opened it exercised jurisdiction over Denmark, Finland, Norway, and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in addition to Sweden. On April 30, 2007, jurisdiction over Denmark and Norway was transferred to a newly-opened embassy in Oslo, while jurisdiction over Finland was transferred to a newly- opened embassy in Helsinki on November 12, 2009, opening the same year as new embassies in Ireland and Portugal. After a massive expansion of the Philippines' diplomatic presence abroad during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, in 2010 Senator Franklin Drilon questioned the need for embassies in countries with small Filipino communities, including a number of countries in Europe, and called for a review of the Philippines' diplomatic presence worldwide. This would lead to the closure of ten posts under Arroyo's successor, Benigno Aquino III, and ultimately to the closure of the Embassy on October 31, 2012. At the time, the Embassy exercised jurisdiction over the Baltic states, which was subsequently transferred to the Philippine Embassy in Warsaw, and Sweden was placed under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Embassy in Oslo, which conducted monthly consular outreach visits. While there was no resident embassy in Sweden, relations were conducted through a reopened honorary consulate, led by Erik Belfrage, who led efforts to reopen the embassy. In 2019, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced that the Philippine Embassy in Stockholm would reopen, part of an expansion of the country's diplomatic presence under Aquino's successor, Rodrigo Duterte. Later that year, a landing team arrived to set up the new embassy, and on May 15, 2020, the Embassy was reopened to the public, four years after Sweden reopened its embassy in Manila. The Embassy's reopening, however, was overshadowed by Belfrage's death the month before due to COVID-19 amidst a pandemic of the disease. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Stockholm is provisionally headed by a chargé d'affaires, pending the appointment of a new ambassador by the Philippine government. The current chargé d'affaires is Raul H. Dado, who had previously served as consul general at the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait City. The last resident ambassador was Maria Zeneida Collinson, appointed in 2007 by President Arroyo. The Embassy currently serves 15,000 Filipinos in Sweden and over 4,000 Filipinos in Finland. While it now handles most consular transactions, passport renewals are still provisionally handled by the Philippine Embassy in Oslo, ostensibly due to delays in receiving passport issuing equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It also was the closing night film of the 2019 Slamdance Film Festival. Plot A French Muslim woman (Hafsia Herzi) travels to New York City from the rough neighborhoods outside of Paris to visit her childhood best friend Zahra (Sarah Kazemy). Hafsia finds that Zahra was not the girl she knew growing up in Paris. She now goes by Sarah and has completely assimilated into Western culture. Sarah explains to her much older boyfriend (Gabe Fazio) that Hafsia stinks and she doesn't want her to stay there anymore, which Hafsia overhears. Hafsia steals Sarah's credit card and identity, then disappears to a remote cabin upstate. Deep in the woods and alone for the first time in her life, she experiences a divine revelation. Sarah arrives and tries to convince Hafsia to return with her, which she refuses. An animal breaks Hafsia's cabin and steals all the food. Initially a couple, teacher Rose (Lucy Walters) and policeman Darren (Kevin Kane), help her. But Hafsia begins to see intolerance and suspicion which reflects back to an Islamophobic America. This third act explores themes such as the inherent racism and naivety that comes along with being a white American, that most white Americans don't even know they have or the rampant Islamophobia that has overtaken most of the world, and the difficulties of being a Muslim, particularly a Muslim woman, in a post-911 world.'This Teacher': Film Review, Hollywood ReporterLorry Kikta.

He wrote editorials for the Belleville Tribune in defense of Stephen A. Douglas, the principal backer of the legislation, and then took a partnership in the newspaper. In 1856 he edited the Sterling (Illinois) Times and also worked actively for James Buchanan, the successful Democratic candidate for president. He next went to Springfield, the state capital, in the hope of being elected clerk of the Illinois House of Representatives. Instead, on January 8, 1856, he became the correspondent there for the Missouri Republican while also being a committee clerk. He was said to have been the first reporter west of the Mississippi River to receive and send a news message on the wires.\\"Personal and Literary,\\" Nashville (Illinois) Journal, October 14, 1881, image 2] In 1859, he made a notable trip in a balloon with three other men, from St. Louis to Jefferson County, New York, an estimated eight hundred miles, a distance flight that was not bested for half a century.

Promotion In February 1992, Pepsi Philippines (PCPPI) announced that they would print numbers, ranging from 001 to 999, inside the caps (crowns) of Pepsi, 7-Up and Mirinda bottles. Certain numbers could be redeemed for prizes, which ranged from 100 pesos (about US$4) to 1 million pesos for a grand prize (roughly US$40,000 in 1992), equivalent to approximately 23 years of earnings at 118 pesos per day, the minimum wage in the Philippines at the time. Pepsi allocated a total of US$2 million for prizes. Marketing specialist Pedro Vergara based Pepsi Number Fever on similar, moderately successful promotions that had been held previously in Vergara's geographic area of expertise, Latin America. Pepsi Number Fever was initially wildly successful, and increased Pepsi's market share from 4% to 24.9%. Winning numbers were announced on television nightly. By May, 51,000 prizes had been redeemed, including 17 grand prizes. Number 349 On May 25, the nightly Channel 2 News broadcast announced that grand prize number for that day was 349. Grand prize-winning bottle caps were tightly controlled by PepsiCo; two bottles with caps with that day's winning number printed inside of them, as well as a security code for confirmation, had been produced and distributed. However, because of a computer error, 800,000 regular bottle caps had also been printed with the number 349 (but without the security code). Theoretically, these bottle caps were cumulatively worth US$32 billion. Thousands of Filipinos rushed to Pepsi bottling plants to claim their prizes. PCPPI initially responded that the erroneously printed bottle caps did not have the confirmation security code, and therefore could not be redeemed. After an emergency meeting of PCPPI and PepsiCo executives at 3:00a.m., the company offered 500 pesos ($18) to holders of mistakenly printed bottle caps, as a \\"gesture of good will\\". This offer would be accepted by 486,170 people, at a cost to PepsiCo of US$8.9 million (240 million pesos). Many irate 349 bottle cap holders refused to accept PCPPI's settlement offer. They formed a consumer group, the 349 Alliance, which organized a boycott of Pepsi products, and held rallies outside the offices of PCPPI and the Philippine government. Most protests were peaceful, but three PCPPI employees were killed by a grenade thrown into a warehouse in Davao, and a mother and child were killed in Manila on February 13, 1992, by a grenade thrown at a Pepsi truck. PCPPI executives received death threats, and as many as 37 company trucks were damaged by being pushed over, stoned or burned. Some accused PepsiCo of hiring mercenaries to stage the attacks, in order to frame the protestors as terrorists; then-senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo however suggested that the attacks were being perpetrated by rival bottlers attempting to take advantage of PCPPI's vulnerability. Legal action About 22,000 people took legal action against PepsiCo; at least 689 civil suits and 5,200 criminal complaints for fraud and deception were filed. On June 24, 1996, a trial court awarded the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits 10,000 pesos (about US$380) each in \\"moral damages\\". Three dissatisfied plaintiffs appealed, and on July 3, 2001, the appellate court awarded these three plantiffs 30,000 pesos (about US$570) each, as well as attorneys' fees. PCPPI appealed against this decision. The suit would reach the Supreme Court, which in 2006 ruled that \\"PCPPI is not liable to pay the amounts printed on the crowns to their holders. Nor is PCPPI liable for damages thereon\\", and that \\"the issues surrounding the 349 incident have been laid to rest and must no longer be disturbed in this decision.\\" See also *McDonald's Monopoly *Hoover free flights promotion ReferencesExternal links * TV commercials for Pepsi Number Fever Category:1992 in the Philippines Category:PepsiCo advertising campaigns Category:Sales promotion Category:1992 controversies Category:Corporate scandals Category:Controversies in the Philippines Category:Consumer boycotts ","title":"Pepsi Number Fever"},{"id":"64251343","text":"Rogstad is a surname.

The deposit is located east of US Highway 29 between the towns of Chatham and Gretna, Virginia, divided into a north and south ore body. A part of Virginia's Western Piedmont Province, the uranium deposit is bounded by the Chatham fault to the east, where it borders the Triassic Danville basin. Uranium minerals are found in the footwall of the Chatham fault, in healed fractures where apatite crystallized from high-temperature hydrothermal water in the Leatherwood granite mylonite. The site was discovered during uranium prospecting in the 1970s, inspired by the Ambrosia Lake deposit in Canada, with exploration led by the Marline Oil Corporation. Uranium is found within a structural trap, surrounded by biotite gneiss, with staining from hematite overlying the Fork Mountain schist. Hematite staining on the ground surface is related to the weathering of the Fork Mountain schist. The exact origin of this uranium deposit is unclear. One model suggests that uranium was dissolved and \\"mobilized\\" from the neighboring Triassic basin by rainwater, while a different interpretation suggests mineralization occurred because of hydrothermal fluids flowing through the rock during the emplacement and cooling of the Leatherwood granite. https://www.godanriver.com/news/pittsylvania_county/supervisors-deny-rezoning- request-by-virginia-uranium- president/article_03c40d14-a5a5-11e8-8d4b-9f3a69098b8a.html References Category:Geology of Virginia Virginia ","title":"Coles Hill uranium deposit"},{"id":"64251370","text":"Jas Waters was a writer for the hit movie What Men Want.

The murals have been a source of controversy in recent decades for their romanticized portrayal of Columbus and his relationship with Native Americans. University founder Edward Sorin commissioned Gregori, an Italian artist who had previously worked for the Vatican, to paint the series, which he completed from 1881 to 1884. Columbus was chosen as the subject because he was seen by Americans as a heroic figure at the time, particularly by Catholics who were facing Anti-Catholic sentiment. As such, Columbus is painted in a saintly manner, while the natives are shown as submissive and filled with awe. In recent decades, however, the murals have faced criticism for their historical inaccuracies and prominent position in Notre Dame's primary administration building, and in September 2020 they were covered with removable prints showing local flora and fauna. History Gregori's sketch of Columbus Coming Ashore, black ink over graphite on tracing paper In 1874, founder and former university president Edward Sorin visited the Vatican and hired Luigi Gregori, an artist-in- residence there, to be an art professor at Notre Dame. An 1879 fire destroyed the campus's Main Building, but it was rebuilt during that summer; two years later, Sorin commissioned Gregori to create a collection of artwork to decorate the first floor of the new Main Building. In the nineteenth century, Americans thought of Columbus as a heroic figure and a symbol of independence, progress, and faith, which went along with the manifest destiny movement. Columbus was also an appealing figure to Notre Dame's faithful population, as Catholics had rallied behind the him as a rare Catholic contributor to the mostly Protestant history of the US. The figure also helped fight the nineteenth-century nativism movement, particularly against Italian Americans, and anti-Catholic sentiment—stemming from the view that Catholics were loyal to the pope before their country. Gregori began the first painting, called Christopher Columbus, Explorer, in mid-November 1881 and finished it before the end of the year. He painted the other eleven murals from 1882 to 1884, completing each one as funds were donated by faculty and other private individuals. He used pigment with casein paint to do his work on the plaster walls. However, the plaster was dry, so they are not true frescoes. At the time, scholars disputed Columbus's physical appearance, and no authoritative portrait existed, so Gregori used then-current president Thomas E. Walsh as the model for Columbus's face in all but one mural and Sorin for Columbus on his deathbed. Notre Dame faculty, Congregation of Holy Cross members, benefactors, and Gregori himself also served as models for other people in the murals. Contemporary accounts and descriptions of the murals are complimentary and reflect the positive image of Columbus. An account in the New York Freeman's Journal, published in 1886 in the Notre Dame Scholastic, says that \\"some of [the] students are young and careless; but the pictures are treated with respect, almost with reverence, and no boyish hand has attempted to deface the walls\\". \\"Columbus Presenting Natives\\", a Columbian Issue postage stamp based on The Reception at Court In honor of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the Columbian Issue, a set of sixteen commemorative postage stamps, was created, and the 10¢ stamp was based on The Reception at Court mural. Description The murals are each tall, ranging in width from . They are all located in a hallway south of the central rotunda of the Main Building. The twelve paintings are: # Christopher Columbus, Discoverer or Christopher Columbus, Explorer—It shows Columbus standing tall next to a globe, in an akimbo posture with his hand on his hip, suggesting importance and influence. He points to North America on the globe, although he never recognized that he had landed on the continent. # Isabella the Catholic, Protectress of Columbus # Columbus at the Gate of the Convent of La Rabida # Father Perez Blesses Columbus before He Embarks—It depicts Juan Pérez with Columbus before departure from Palos de la Frontera. # The Mutiny at Sea # Discovery of Land, Friday, October 12, 1492 or Sighting of Land, Friday, October 12, 1492 # Taking Possession of the New World or Columbus Coming Ashore # Return of Columbus and Reception at Court # Bobadilla Betrays Columbus—Francisco de Bobadilla in Columbus' cottage # Death of Columbus, Valladolid, May 20, 1506 # Father Diego de Deza, Protector of Columbus at Salamanca—It depicts Diego de Deza, the son of Ferdinand and Isabella, who helped Columbus gain access to them. # Luis de Santangel, Treasurer of Aragon—Luis de Santángel helped Columbus secure funding for his voyage. The murals portray Columbus in a saintly light, and Gregori painted scenes showing Columbus as doing God's work. The Reception at Court depicts Columbus presenting treasures of the New World to King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I of Spain: pineapples, nuts, spices, gold figurines, a parrot, as well as several Taíno people. The presence of a large number of clergy indicates that the natives are to be baptized. A large crowd watches behind them, and in the background is a fleet of ships. There are numerous historical inaccuracies in the murals. In The Reception at Court, for example, the natives are depicted holding shields which northern Plains Indians would use and wearing Mandan clothes, whereas Columbus actually encountered the Taíno of the Caribbean. The inaccuracies are attributed to a combination of ignorance (at the time, Native Americans were seen as a monolithic group, rather than a diverse group of tribes) and intentional symbolism (Notre Dame's founding Holy Cross missionaries encountered Plains Natives). Furthermore, Gregori may have drawn inspiration from Notre Dame's own collection of artifacts. Controversy In 1997, a faculty committee created a brochure to offer historical context to the murals, saying that \\"the University of Notre Dame recognizes that the Columbus murals reflect 19th-century white European views of race, gender and ethnicity which may be offensive to some individuals\\". A 2017 letter to the editor of Notre Dame's student newspaper, The Observer, signed by over 300 students, employees, and alumni, called for the murals to be removed. In January 2019, university president John I. Jenkins announced a plan to cover the murals. In September 2020, the paintings were covered with fabric decorated to resemble tapestries of plants and animals, although the coverings can be removed for faculty and other uses.

It is well- known for being the site where Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh disembarked from a royal barge in 1959 during the first-ever British royal visit to Chicago.  History  Queen's Landing is visible on the lakefront at the bottom of the image, just to the right of Buckingham Fountain.  Royal visit  Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley invited Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to Chicago after the Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in the summer of 1959. The monarchs traveled through the seaway on the royal yacht HMY Britannia, which was escorted by seven warships, many other small craft, and two Chinese junks. On Monday, 6 July 1959, more than a million people gathered at the lake shore to see the royal couple. Mayor Daley's special events director, Colonel Jack Reilly, sent over 700 invitations to the reception. Elizabeth gave a short speech after disembarking, and she was greeted by Mayor Daley and his wife, as well as Illinois Governor William Stratton and his wife, Shirley. Elizabeth reviewed some troops that were posted at the lakefront, and the monarchs moved on to a thirteen hour tour of the city. The royal entourage headed west to Michigan Avenue, where the parade turned right and headed north through the Loop and over the Chicago River until reaching Navy Pier. Elizabeth and Philip went to the International Trade Fair, where they walked down the world's longest red carpet, which spanned 2,300 feet. The monarchs proceed to visit the Ambassador Hotel for lunch, after which they toured the campus of the University of Chicago as well as the Museum of Science and Industry. The couple then went to the Art Institute of Chicago for a brief visit and attended a reception at the Drake Hotel, where they were greeted by Midwestern governors and mayors. However, the tour experienced one delay: Elizabeth II had to receive an emergency tooth filling. Afterwards, the monarchs traveled to a banquet at Conrad Hilton Hotel, which was hosted by Mayor Daley. Almost 1,000 people participated in the dinner service, with attendees including Etta Moten Barnett and John H. Sengstacke. Elizabeth told the diners that \\"Ever since we landed this morning we have not ceased to be impressed by the massive dignity of your city…We shall carry with us…a memory of the generous hospitality of Chicago which will long warm our hearts.” Later that evening, fireworks were displayed at the lakefront, and Elizabeth told Mayor Daley “This is an unforgettable day – a day I will never forget.”  Lake Shore Drive crosswalk  In 1988, a crosswalk was created at Lake Shore Drive between Queen's Landing and Buckingham Fountain to facilitate pedestrian traffic. In 2005, this crosswalk was removed, meaning that pedestrians wanting to cross the street towards Queen's Landing had to travel a quarter-mile north or south to Jackson Drive or Balbo Drive respectively if they wanted to use a marked crosswalk. Despite the removal of the crosswalk, pedestrians kept crossing Lake Shore Drive at the same location in order to save time. The crosswalk was eventually restored in 2011 at a cost of $125,000.

Bradford City of Film  In 2007, Steve Abbott was appointed as the Chair of the world's first UNESCO City of Film committee. James Bridge, head of the National Commission for UNESCO, said Abbott's work advising cities worldwide, including Qingdao in China, had made Bradford a Best Practice model, “bringing jobs and investment to the city and, most importantly, pride and self belief.” He added: “Being the world’s first City of Film is part of Bradford’s identity. Out there in UNESCO there are 180 Creative Cities, all talking about Bradford.” Lord Mayor of Bradford Councillor Doreen Lee, who presented Mr Abbott with a ‘Brafta’ award, said: “This city is famous for producing stars and you’re up there with the best. We are extremely proud of you.” After 10 years as the Chair leading successful bids for Bradford City of Film, Abbott resigned from the chairman position, in his words, to make way for \\"new, younger, more diverse blood\\". He was honoured a \\"Brafta\\" at a civic reception presented by Lord Mayor of Bradford Councillor Doreen Lee, for his work in making Bradford the first City of Film in the world.  Recognition  In 1998, Abbott was given an Honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Bradford. He was also awarded an Honorary Fellow from the Bradford College on December 5, 2012.  Personal life  Steve Abbott is a long-time cricket fan. An NME journalist quoted that Steve Abbott is known for his amazing hair.

It travels parallel to Pike Street between Downtown Seattle and the retail core to Capitol Hill, the Central District, and Madrona. Street description Looking west on Pine Street from 1st Avenue near Pike Place Market Pine Street consists of several discontinuous sections that run between Olive Street and Olive Way to the north and Pike Street to the south. Its westernmost section is one block long and begins at Alaskan Way near Pier 62 on the city's waterfront, a block north of the Seattle Aquarium. It terminates at the former site of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which led to a public staircase called the Pine Street Hillclimb, which provided access to Pike Place Market. The main section of Pine Street in Downtown Seattle begins at Pike Place Market, intersecting the eponymous Pike Place and traveling northeast and uphill to 1st Avenue. The bi-directional street then switches to westbound- only traffic with a protected bicycle lane along its south side. Pine Street is the center of Seattle's downtown retail district, passing several major retail buildings from west to east: the former Bon Marché flagship store between 3rd and 4th avenues; the Westlake Center shopping mall and Westlake Park between 4th and 5th; Nordstrom's flagship store between 5th and 6th; and Pacific Place mall between 6th and 7th. This section is also home to the Westlake station of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which is served by Link light rail. Pine Street reverts to bi-directional traffic at 8th Avenue on the north side of the Washington State Convention Center and continues northeast. The street then passes the Paramount Theatre and the former site of Convention Place station at 9th Avenue and continues to an intersection with Boren Avenue that sits over Interstate 5. Pine Street turns due east as it enters Capitol Hill, passing apartment buildings and local restaurants as it climbs the hill. The street intersects Broadway on the south side of the Seattle Central College campus and Cal Anderson Park, becoming East Pine Street. The continuous section of Pine Street ends beyond 16th Avenue, where the road dives southeast to intersect Madison Street. East Pine Street resumes at 17th Avenue adjacent to a trio of television antennas on the north side of Cherry Hill. The street travels east through a predominantly residential area with several small traffic circles, crossing into Madrona after intersecting Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The street ends at 37th Avenue and continues east down a public staircase and bridge, ultimately terminating at 40th Avenue a block west of Lake Washington Boulevard. History Looking east on Pine Street from 3rd Avenue, 2000 Pine Street was named by Arthur A. Denny in his Third Addition plat, which was filed on April 5, 1869. The section between 7th Avenue in Downtown Seattle and Boylston Avenue on Capitol Hill was regraded between 1907 and 1909 to improve its accessibility and increase the value of nearby property. The regrading was also used to bury several sections of old boardwalks that were later unearthed during tunnel construction in 2005 and 2011. A section of East Pine Street was known by various names, including Gould, Mastick, and Warren streets, prior to a 1895 realignment of street names in the city. A downtown section of Pine Street between 4th and 9th avenues was closed on April 27, 1987, for construction of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. The cut-and-cover tunnel under Pine Street included Westlake and Convention Place stations and cost $74.5 million to construct. Excavation was completed in August 1987 and the street was temporarily backfilled to reopen to traffic for the Christmas shopping season at the request of downtown merchants. Pine Street was fully re-opened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the opening of Westlake Center and Westlake Park. The mezzanine level of Westlake station, running under two blocks of Pine Street, was opened on August 11, 1989, while the tunnel opened for bus traffic in September 1990. A one-block section of Pine Street between 4th and 5th avenues was converted into a pedestrian zone in July 1989, after the city government began repairing decorative paving stones that were installed at Westlake Park and damaged by heavy traffic. The Seattle City Council had previously voted in 1988 to keep Pine Street open to all traffic, at the urging of the Downtown Seattle Association, but reconsidered a permanent closure after the repairs began. Outgoing mayor Charles Royer ordered that Pine Street remained a permanent pedestrian zone, but councilmember and mayor-elect Norm Rice led a 5–4 majority of the city council in supporting a reopening plan. Rice later endorsed the pedestrian zone and also rejected a proposal to allow trolleybuses to use the block. The renovation of the vacated Frederick & Nelson flagship store for Nordstrom in the mid-1990s re-ignited the Pine Street debate. The company made the re-opening of the block a key demand in its renovation proposal, which was of high priority for the city government. A city-commissioned study found that the closed block on Pine Street had made no difference in traffic congestion around Downtown Seattle, due to mitigation measures in other areas to accommodate a 6 percent increase in automobile traffic. The city council endorsed the re-opening plan but placed a ballot measure for the March 14, 1995, election to decide the issue. The ballot measure to re-open Pine Street passed with 60 percent in favor across the city amid a higher than usual voter turnout. The one-block section of Pine Street was reopened on January 6, 1997, with one lane of through traffic and a widened mid-block crosswalk. A three-block section of Pine Street near the Seattle Police Department's East Precinct on Capitol Hill was closed during the June 2020 George Floyd protests. After several days of demonstrations, the precinct was vacated and the blocked section of Pine Street was occupied by demonstrators as part of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (later Capitol Hill Occupied Protest). On June 11, a mural reading \\"Black Lives Matter\\" was painted on a block-long section of Pine Street between 10th and 11th avenues, which was renamed \\"Black Lives Matter Way\\" by demonstrators. The protest zone was dismantled on July 1, 2020, and was replaced by a police barricade from Broadway to the East Precinct. Pine Street was reopened to traffic three days later with barriers on surrounding streets. A permanent version of the mural was painted in October 2020 with recessed letters. Transit service Pine Street is a major transit corridor in Downtown Seattle that is used by several King County Metro bus routes. Route 10 uses Pine Street for its inbound trips to Downtown Seattle between 2nd Avenue and Bellevue Avenue. Route 11 travels along the street from Downtown Seattle to Madison Street, continuing northeast to Madison Park. Route 49 runs on Pine Street from 4th Avenue to Broadway, turning north towards the University District. Sound Transit's Link light rail system stops under Pine Street at Westlake station, which has several entrances between 3rd and 5th avenues. The Seattle Center Monorail terminates at Westlake Center on the north side of Pine Street, but had a terminal that spanned the street until 1986.

Goal-oriented care. 2015:1-19 He defined a goal as a desired outcome that is essential to the patient and proposed that four major goal types are relevant to health care: 1) prevention of premature (i.e., preventable) death and disability; 2) maximization of current health-related quality of life; 3) optimization of personal growth and development; and 4) improving the chances of a good death.

Goal-oriented patient care - an alternative health outcomes paradigm. New England Journal of Medicine. 2012;366(9):777–9. The uniting factor of this conceptual framework is that the goal is formed in a discussion involving both the patient and the health care providers prior to the development of a plan of care that is based upon the patient's goals and priorities, resources and abilities, values and preferences. Prevention of premature death and disability Preventing premature death is a basic tenet of medical and health theory. Chene, G. \\"Prevention of the causes of premature illness and death: making it happen.\\" Lancet Public Health. Feb 2017; 2(2):e69-e70. doi: 10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30005-1. Epub 2017 Jan 14. All human beings want to stay alive as long as possible up to the point when life becomes unbearable, when death becomes a preferable alternative. For each person that point is different and must be determined and reviewed periodically. Tinetti ME, Bogardus ST Jr, Agostini JV. Potential pitfalls of disease- specific guidelines for patients with multiple conditions. N Engl J Med. Preventing premature death and disability can best be accomplished by preferentially implementing preventive strategies with the highest potential impact. A goal- directed approach therefore emphasizes the prioritization of preventive strategies. That process of prioritization includes consideration of all measures that a person might be willing to take to extend their life or prevent disability including primary, secondary, and tertiary preventive strategies. Maximization of current quality of life Health-related quality of life is the ability to participate in both necessary and meaningful activities, defined broadly to include physical, cognitive, and interpersonal activities. The specific components of quality of life for each person are unique, and so measures taken to preserve and enhance quality of life will also differ. Purkaple, BA, Mold, JW, and Chen, S.

This tenet is fundamental to the fields of Occupational Therapy and Sports Medicine and is routinely applied in palliative care, which utilizes a goal directed approach for patients with serious, chronic illnesses that balances prevention of death with optimizing quality of life. Optimization of personal growth and development Growth and development are most often emphasized during childhood. Piaget J. The Psychology of the Child.

The assailant used a car bomb to attack the Riot Control Police checkpoint of the district's Police Department. In the attack, a total of 13 people died, 12 of them police officers along with the assailant, and 78 people were injured, including three civilians.  Attack  The attack took place at 06:45 (UTC+03:00) local time on the street where the Cizre District Police Headquarters and the Riot Control Branch Office buildings are located in the Konak neighborhood of Cizre. The attacker approached the police checkpoint with the 10 ton explosives loaded on a truck, following which a conflict broke out. When the assailant could not cross the police checkpoint located about from the police buildings, he exploded the bomb loaded vehicle there.  Later events  As a result of the explosion, the assailant and 11 police officers died and 78 people were injured. On 29 September 2016, with the death of police officer Safa Altınsoy at Gülhane Military Medical Academy, who was injured during the incident, the number of security personnel who lost their lives rose to 12. In addition, Cizre District Governor Ahmet Adanur and a seven-month-old baby were reported among the injured. Due to the severity of the explosion, the district police headquarters building was destroyed and damage occurred in many houses and workplaces. On the side of the building, the sections where the police were staying were destroyed and the material warehouse lit up. Part of the retaining wall of the Cizre Garrison Command was damaged. Reinforcement police teams, TOMAs and fire trucks were dispatched to the scene. After the attack, the Governor of Şırnak banned the entrance and exit to Cizre district, and the Cizre-Şırnak highway was closed to transportation. Within the scope of the investigation made after the attack, it was claimed that the dump truck used was owned by Şırnak Municipality and rented and used by Cizre Municipality. The PKK, who took responsibility for the attack on the same day, announced the name of the attacker as Mustafa Aslan, whose code name was Fırat Pirsus.  Broadcasting ban  The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) stated that with the letter of the Prime Minister, a temporary broadcasting ban was imposed on the attack in Cizre. In the written statement made by RTÜK, it was stated that in article 7 of the Law No. 6112 on the Establishment and Broadcasting Services of Radio and Television, that \\"temporary broadcasting prohibition can be imposed when national security is clearly required or when the public order is likely to be severely impaired.\\"  Perpetrators  The military arm of the PKK, HPG, took responsibility for the attack that was carried out during in Cizre as well as the attack that occurred during the passage of a convoy in Şavşat, which also included the leader of the Republican People's Party Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, and in which a soldier was killed.Official Journal of the European Union (PDF file) In a statement made by HPG, it was stated that the Cizre attack was carried out in revenge for people killed during the Şırnak clashes (2015–2016).  Reactions = National  President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan issued a written message addressing the attack in Cizre. In his message, Erdoğan said \\"Turkey will never give passage to the dirty ambitions of subcontractors.\\" Stating that the attack has increased the determination to fight terrorism even more, Erdoğan made the assessment that \\"No one should doubt that our struggle against terrorist attacks targeting our children in Gaziantep and the leader of the main opposition party in Artvin will be successful due to our understanding of their mobilization.\\" Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım, who was on an official tour of Bulgaria, held a joint press conference with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov in which he said \\"We have fought a total war against all terrorist organizations.

Lesions in that pathway cause a variety of visual field defects. In the visual system of human eye, the visual information processed by retinal photoreceptor cells travel in the following way: Retina→Optic nerve→Optic chiasm (here the nasal visual field of both eyes cross over to the opposite side)→Optic tract→Lateral geniculate nucleus→Optic radiation→Primary and secondary visual cortices. The type of field defect can help localize where the lesion is located (see picture given in infobox). Optic nerve lesions The optic nerve, also known as cranial nerve II, extends from the optic disc to the optic chiasma. Lesions in optic nerve causes visual field defects and blindness. Causes Causes of optic nerve lesions include optic atrophy, optic neuropathy, head injury etc. Signs and symptoms Visual field-tubular vision Visual field-central scotoma * Lesions involving the whole optic nerve cause complete blindness on the affected side, that means damage at the right optic nerve causes complete loss of vision in the right eye. * Optic neuritis involving external fibers of the optic nerve causes tunnel vision. * Optic neuritis involving internal fibers of the optic nerve causes central scotoma. lf unilateral central scotoma is detected, careful observation of the temporal visual field of other eye is essential to rule out the possibility of compressive lesions at the junction of optic nerve and optic chiasm. * Other symptoms include absence of direct light reflex, afferent pupillary defect, defective colour vision, decreased contrast sensitivity, generalized decrease in visual sensitivity etc. Optic chiasm lesions The optic chiasm, or optic chiasma is the part of the brain where both optic nerves cross. It is located at the bottom of the brain immediately inferior to the hypothalamus. Signs and symptoms associated with optic chiasm lesions are also known as chiasmal syndrome. Chiasmal syndrome has been classified into three types; anterior, middle and posterior chiasmal syndromes. Another type is lateral chiasmal syndrome. Causes Causes of chiasmal syndromes may be classified into intrinsic and extrinsic forms. Intrinsic causes are due to thickening of the chiasm itself and extrinsic implies compression by another structure. Other less common causes of chiasmal syndrome are metabolic, toxic, traumatic or infectious in nature. Compression of the optic chiasm is associated with pituitary adenoma, Craniopharyngioma, Meningioma etc. Signs and symptoms Visual field-bitemporal hemianopia Visual field-binasal hemianopia * A lesion involving complete optic chiasm, which disrupts the axons from the nasal field of both eyes, causes loss of vision of the right half of the right visual field and the left half of the left visual field. This visual field defect is called as bitemporal hemianopia. * Anterior chiasmal syndrome, the lesions that affect the ipsilateral optic nerve fibres and the contralateral inferonasal fibres located in the Willebrand knee produce junctional scotoma, i.e., a combination of central scotoma in one eye and temporal hemianopia defect in the other eye. * Middle chiasmal syndrome, the lesions involving the decussating fibres in the body of chiasma produce bitemporal hemianopia. * Posterior chiasmal syndrome, the lesions affecting the caudal fibres in chiasma produce paracentral bitemporal field defects. Homonymous hemianopia on the contralateral side may occur when posterior chiasmal lesions involve the optic tract. * Lateral chiasmal lesions may produce binasal hemianopia. * Lesions at the junction of the optic nerve and chiasm may produce an ipsilateral monocular temporal scotoma known as 'junctional scotoma'. Scottish ophthalmologist Henry Moss Traquair first identified and named this field defect. Lesions of optic tract The optic tract is a continuation of the optic nerve that relays information from the optic chiasm to the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), pretectal nuclei, and superior colliculus.Optic tract. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/430336/optic-tract (accessed Nov 1, 2013). The optic tract represents the first stage in the visual pathway in which visual information is transferred in a homonymous nature. Main characteristic feature of lesion involving whole optic tract is homonymous hemianopsia. A lesion in the left optic tract will cause right-sided homonymous hemianopsia, while a lesion in the right optic tract will cause left-sided homonymous hemianopsia. Causes The optic tract syndrome is characterized by a contralateral, incongruous homonymous hemianopia, contralateral relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), and optic atrophy due to retrograde axonal degeneration. Causes of optic tract lesions are also classified into intrinsic and extrinsic forms. Intrinsic lesions include demyelinating diseases and infarction. Such lesions produce optic tract syndrome type II. Extrinsic or compressive lesions are caused by pituitary craniopharyngioma, tumours of optic thalamus. Other causes include syphilitic meningitis, gumma and tubercular meningitis etc. Signs and symptoms Visual field-homonymous hemianopia * Incongruous homonymous hemianopia. * Wernicke's pupillary reaction- No pupillary reaction when light shown to the blind half of retina, but if light is shown to seeing half, pupil shows reaction. Lesions of lateral geniculate nucleus  The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the nucleus in the thalamus that receives visual information from the retina and sends it to the visual cortex via optic radiations. A lesion of this nucleus produces moderately to completely congruent visual field defects. Isolated lesions of the lateral geniculate nucleus are rare, it may be diagnosed by distinctive patterns of visual field loss. Causes Pituitary adenoma compression may cause LGN degeneration. Lesions affecting the anterior or lateral choroidal arteries may affect the lateral geniculate nucleus. Signs and symptoms * Incongruous homonymous hemianopia. * Pupillary reflexes are normal, as fibers for pupillary reflexes from the optic tract are diverted to pretectal nucleus and do not reach the LGN. * Optic disc pallor may occur due to partial descending atrophy. Lesions of optic radiations The optic radiation are axons from the neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus to the primary visual cortex. Causes Middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery infarcts may affect the optic radiations, and can cause quadrantanopias. Signs ans symptoms Visual field-right superior quadrantanopia * Lesions of right temporal lobe (meyer's Loop) of the optic radiation on one side produces a loss of the upper, outer quadrant of vision on the same side in both eyes, known as homonymous superior quadrantanopia or superior quadrantic hemianopia. This is also known as pie in the sky disorder. * A lesion in the right parietal lobe cause inferior quadrantic hemianopia. It is also known as pie on the floor disorder. * Complete homonymous hemianopia is produced when total fibres of optic radiations are involved. * Pupillary reflexes are normal. * Optic disc atrophy does not occur in lesions of optic radiations, as the second order neurons synapse in the LGN. Lesions of visual cortex The visual cortex located in the occipital lobe of the brain is that part of the cerebral cortex which processes visual information. Cortical blindness refers to any partial or complete visual deficit that is caused by damage to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Unilateral lesions can lead to homonymous hemianopias and scotomas. Bilateral lesions can cause complete cortical blindness and can sometimes be accompanied by a condition called Anton-Babinski syndrome. Causes Stroke, head injury or gunshot injuries, infection, eclampsia, encephalitis, meningitis, medications, and hyperammonemia can cause cortical blindness. Signs and symptoms * Occipital cortex lesions tend to cause homonymous hemianopias of variable size,with or without macular involvement. * Congruous homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing is a feature of occlusion of posterior cerebral artery supplying the anterior part of the visual cortex. * Bilateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing producing a picture of ring scotoma is seen in bilateral occipital lobe lesions. * Pupillary reflex is nornmal * Optic atrophy does not occur. * Dyschromatopsia. Diagnosis=Visual field testing Measurements of visual field defects can be done by visual field testing. It can be performed by various methods, including confrontation technique, amsler grid, tangent screen, kinetic perimetry, or static perimetry. Cost common is automated perimetry. =Confrontation test= Confrontation visual field testing is a simple and quick visual field assessing method. A confrontational field test requires little or no special equipment and can be performed in any room, which is well illuminated. Patient sitting straight in front of the examiner, is asked look directly at the examiner's eye during the test. The target eye should be the one directly across from the patient's eye. When the patient's right eye is being tested, closing the other eye, patient is instructed to look directly at the examiners left eye. Examiner closes his/her left eye, and then conduct finger movements, bringing his/her fingers or any other into your visual field from the sides. Since the test is basically comparison of the patient's visual field with the examiner's visual field, it is not an accurate measument of visual field. =Perimetry= Modern computerized perimeters like humphrey field analyser (HFA) give more comprehensive and accurate reports than finger testing methods. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain and orbit helps to find the exact site of a lesion. Computed tomography scan CT scan is also used for investigating cause of visual pathway lesions. Treatment Tumours and other compressive lesions could often present with visual impairment and/or visual field defects. Careful clinical assessment could aid in accurate diagnosis of the cause of the visual field defect and loss of vision. Compressive lesions of the visual pathway, especially lesions affecting optic nerve require a multi-disciplinary approach involving neurosurgeon, physician as well as the ophthalmologist. Treatment is given according to the cause.

His death was widely reported to have been the first of its kind in the US since the 1940s, with the military testing of atomic bombs (i.e. the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, N.M.), and is notable for being the only US death attributable to an unknown source of radiation, along with being the only known case in the US of a suspected suicide undertaken via radiation exposure. Personal life Prior to injury, Crofut was a 38 year old unemployed Industrial radiographer who specialized in X-raying pipeline wields. Crofut was reported to have last worked with sources of radiation in October 1980, when he was employed with a Houston pipeline inspection firm. Some of Crofut’s neighbors described him as a “loner”. Injury On January 22, 1981, Crofut was brought to Okmulgee Memorial Hospital by his sister, who noticed that Crofut was suffering from radiation burns and external bleeding coming from Crofut’s left arm and torso. Crofut’s sister reported that the burns were of such severity that Crofut’s left nipple had been burnt away. Doctors determined that Crotfut had suffered a massive exposure to an unknown source of radiation. In late January, Crofut was transferred to another hospital (St. Francis in Tulsa) due to his serious medical state as a result of his severe radiation burns. By mid-march of that year, Crofut appeared to show some signs of improvement. His medical status was upgraded to ‘fair’, and it was reported that skin grafts were being considered. However, doctors were uncertain of Crofut’s ultimate prognosis. It was believed that the radiation Crofut had received was “probably lethal”. Crofut's deep burns continued to worsen, requiring intermittent hospitalization over the next six months. Officials reported that Crofut’s radiation injuries had “destroyed [Crofut’s] bone marrow, burned off his left nipple, and ate deep into his body like a cancer.” Death Crofut continued to undergo treatment for the burns to his chest and left arm in the months following his initial injury. On June 1, 1981, Crofut was admitted to a local hospital and placed into intensive care due to an ongoing infection, where he died. Due to the \\"extremely rare\\" circumstances of Crofut’s injury, his story was followed by the media, who reported his death to be “agonizing”. One doctor stated that Crofut’s “Cells were degenerating before our very eyes\\". Following his death, Crofut's attorney, Richard Gibbons, described the radiation burns as “grotesque” and “painful”, saying “the area that I looked at was the left side of his chest and it was the most of the left side from his belt line up above his breast. The meat was just completely eaten out and gone for a depth of at least 2 inches”. Gibbons said the radiation burns kept growing, finally “eating away until it got to a vital organ - probably his heart. The man was in such obvious pain.” Karl Seyfrit, who was director of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) office in Arlington, VA at the time of Crofut’s death, stated that he knew of no other deaths directly attributable to a radioactive source, and Crofut was believed to be the first American to die of radiation injuries since the early days of atomic bomb experimentation. Investigation Shortly after Crofut first sought medical care, when it was determined that he had been exposed to a powerful source of radiation, Crofut’s injuries were investigated by the NRC. Initially, officials were concerned that other individuals may have been injured by the same source as Crofut. Both Crofut’s sister and ex-wife were tested, with neither showing signs of radiation poisoning. NRC tests performed on Crofut indicated that had been exposed to gamma rays, either from Iridium-192 or Cobalt-60. The estimated the dosage was believed to be 356 rads or 405 rads, respectively (at around 400 rads, roughly 50% people exposed will die). The NRC believed that Crofut’s Injuries were consistent with radiation exposure occurring between Dec 15, 1980 and Jan 10, 1981. One particularly unusual circumstance concerned the difficulty in determining the radioactive source which had caused Crofut’s injuries. The NRC discovered that on December 30, 1980, an industrial radiographic device (along with its protective container) had been reported stolen from a locked truck belonging to a pipe- line inspection company. This incident occurred at the residence of a second radiographer, only a half-mile away from Crofut’s home in Henryetta, OK. The stolen source contained a capsule of Iridium-192, such as that suspected of causing injury to Crofut. The NRC believed the device was unlikely item to have been intentionally stolen, citing that there was no known personal use for such a device, nor was there a market to sell it to (without the seller raising suspicions). Ultimately, the stolen Iridium-192 source turned up on the back porch of a third radiographer also living in Crofut’s neighborhood. Neither of the two other radiographers were believed to have been involved in the theft or Crofut’s injuries. Crofut himself denied any knowledge of the stolen radiographic device, and a NRC spokesman stated that Crofut had never been employed by the company from whose truck the iridium disappeared, and that Crofut had not been directly tied to the theft. No other potential sources of radiation were identified by the NRC, and ultimately the source of radiation which injured Crofut still remains unknown. The NRC investigation was eventually closed without drawing any conclusions. An NRC official reportedly described the situation as “weird”, and “one with a lot of quirks in it that so far defy explanation.” Suicide theory Following Crofut’s injury and eventual death, a number of NRC investigators and other officials commented to the media that they suspected that Crofut may have intentionally self-inflicted his radiation injuries. Some investigators speculated that Crofut could have removed the iridium capsule from its heavy lead shielding and placed it into his shirt pocket for at least 5 minutes, receiving what ultimately proved to be a fatal dosage of radiation. The NRC further suggested a possible self-harm theory after looking into Crofut’s personal and professional background. One past example which was cited, occurred on December 13, 1979, when Crofut was fired from Tulsa Gamma Ray Inc. (now TGR Industrial Services) for alcohol intoxication. Crofut was reported to have been found intoxicated, kneeling over a radiation-emitting device and exposing himself to its hazardous rays. However, this incident was reported to have left Crofut with no documented injuries. On another occasion, a neighbor claimed that Crofut had been witnessed dousing gasoline over his body with a rag and then making an unsuccessful attempt to ignite himself with a match. Additionally, NRC officials believed Crofut to be an alcoholic who was deeply in debt and had difficulty keeping a job. Crofut was reported to have a record of 16 arrests between 1974 and 1980, with most being liquor law violations, such as public intoxication. Accidental exposure theory Following his death, Crofut’s attorney stated that he would consider potentially taking legal action as a result of Crofut’s radiation exposure. Gibson mentioned Crofut’s last workplace in New Mexico as a potential source of exposure, as well as the possibility that Crofut could have unknowingly come into contact with the stolen Iridum-192 device at some point in Henryetta.

Early life  Davis was born in 1907 in Melbourne, where she resided for all her life. She began performing in 1916 as a nine year old, playing the piano and xylophone at various venues around Melbourne. In 1921 her five year old sister Olga joined her for \\"Baby Olga and Edna Davis\\" which featured at The Tivoli, and other venues in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. In 1929 their mother took them to London and Cairo to perform the show, perhaps as a result of their parents separation and subsequent divorce.  Career  Davis was trained in pianoforte and opera singing, and a self- taught xylophone player. She was a natural performer, and earned much success as a teenager doing elaborate stage presentations before film showings in silent movie theatres. Her remarkable skill earned her billings at theatres all over Melbourne, including the Victory in St. Kilda, the Renown in Elsternwick, and the Regent in Thornbury. Known as \\"Little Edna Davis: the Celebrated Child Xylophonist\\", her popularity led to her touring interstate in 1922, at just fifteen years old. As she got older and her popularity as a child performer waned, Davis enjoyed further success as a composer. She wrote a number of marches for public performances, including the \\"Centenary March\\" in 1934 for the Duke of Gloucester's visit to Australia, while he sailed up Port Phillip Bay. In later life she would compose a march for the West Gate Bridge opening in 1978 entitled \\"Mighty West Gate Bridge March\\". Dressed in sequins and heavy makeup and accompanied by the RAAF band, she sung and danced her way through the opening and was described as being \\"totally nuts.\\"  Legal \\"career\\"  Edna Davis and John Isaacs on their wedding day. In 1938 Davis married her first husband John Isaacs, brother of Sir Isaac Isaacs, the former Governor-General and Chief Justice of Australia. John was a solicitor and forty-four years her senior; undoubtedly captivated by her vivacity. However their marriage was a tumultuous one, with Davis' hectic social calendar and frequent outbursts interfering with the quieter life appreciated by the older Isaacs. Their final dispute was over John secretly changing the sole ownership of his house to a joint tenancy with his brother, which meant she wouldn't inherit the house upon his death. She left the house the next day. The breakdown of his brother's marriage with Davis led Sir Isaac to use his connections to legally pursue and diminish her up until his death. Davis tried to return to their home but was advised by her husband's solicitors that upon her doing so her maintenance payments from him would be reduced. Due to a lack of funds, she pawned the wedding ring John had given her, which had belonged to his mother Rebecca. This spurred on Sir Isaac to cut all amenities to the home and have the furniture removed. She responded by taking legal action over the loss of the ring, and suing the removalists who took the furniture. Davis' inability to let matters lie and Isaacs' determination to fight for his brother led to a battle of litigation which favoured Sir Isaac and his vast influence and left Davis penniless. After having many days in court he used his influence to have her declared a \\"vexatious litigant\\" preventing her from pursuing any further legal action without leave of the Court. Sir Isaac Isaacs, Edna Davis, and John Isaacs at the piano  Russian interest  Davis married her second husband Geza \\"Fred\\" Laszloffy, twenty three years her junior, in February 1954 at the Catholic Sacred Heart Church in St. Kilda. Her new husband's income from factory work allowed Davis to further her career of musical composition and receive significant publicity. Davis enjoyed linking her music to events in contemporary life, composing with Laszloffy Under the Sputnik With You in tribute to the Russians' successful launch of two unmanned satellites into space in 1957. The song was a smash hit in Russia, leading to several other musical pieces for the Russian market and winning them a Lenin medal. This Russian interest also earned the couple special attention from ASIO, with security files monitoring them for a decade.

Ice Box ranks as ninth-highest in the Entiat Mountains, and 147th of Washington's highest 200 peaks. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Maude, to the north, Spectacle Buttes are set to the northeast, and Chilly Peak is to the southeast. Ice Box is situated south of Ice Lakes in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains east into Ice Creek, or west into Box Creek. This peak is postioned between these two creeks, hence its name. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Ice Box is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Ice Box can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology Ice Box (right) from trail to Ice Lakes, (Peak 7919 to left) The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Ice Box, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Ice Box, volcanic ash and tephra is common in the area. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. See also View from Mt.

(BAVI), also known as Bounty is a poultry company based in Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines. As the main company of the Bounty Fresh Group of Companies, it manages roast chicken retail chains Chooks-to-Go and Uling Roasters, and Adobo Connection. History Bounty Agro Ventures, Inc. was established in 1997 as a family business of Tennyson Chen. The company initially started as a supplier of dressed whole chicken and chicken parts under the Bounty Fresh brand to retailers. Chen has been involved in the poultry business as early as the 1980s, who began with a layer farm in Santa Maria, Bulacan with 5,000 chickens. The company was threatened by the gradual implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area of the late-1990s and faced fiercer competition from other producers in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, which could offer larger chicken at the same price Bounty offers. The implementation of the free trade area led to Bounty's later expansion to sell cooked chicken. By 2002, Bounty started serving its chicken products under vacuum packaging, being the first company to do so in the local market. At around that time Bounty has a ten percent share of the market. In 2008, Bounty launched the Chooks-to-Go rotisserie chain, which was initially known as Bounty Fresh Oven Roasted Chicken. It set up a second brand, Uling Roasters which sells charcoal-roasted chicken. Sports Bounty Agro Ventures has been involved in Philippine 3x3 basketball sponsoring events under its Chooks-to-Go brand. It has organized the Manok ng Bayan–SBP 3X3, a youth tournament meant to garner FIBA ranking points as part of the 3x3 national team's qualification bid to the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Chooks-to-Go Pilipinas 3x3, a 3x3 league sanctioned by the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, the Philippines' national governing body for basketball.

History  The funduq was built in 1711 CE (1123 AH) during the reign of the Alaouite Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif, probably by the initiative of powerful local merchants or officials. Like other buildings of its type, it served as a center of commercial activity and merchant dealings, and became one of the most important ones in Fes. The ground floor of the building was devoted exclusively to commercial activities, while the upper floors were taken up by artisan workshops and used for the storage of merchandise. In the early 20th century, it was particularly known for the sale of tea. The funduq recently underwent a major restoration between 2013 and 2017 within the framework of an initiative to rehabilitate 27 historic monuments in Fes. During the restoration process, archaeological excavations were also carried out and revealed the remains of Marinid-era (13th-15th century) houses with zellij decoration, some of whose foundations had been reused for the foundations of the funduq.  Architecture  The architecture of the Funduq Sagha is very similar to that of another funduq founded in the same year (1711), the Funduq an-Najjariyyin (), which is used today as a museum and tourist attraction. Like the latter, it also faces a small square (known as Place Sagha) which is equipped with an old fountain. The funduq is entered via a monumental entrance portal decorated primarily with tilework painted with arabesque motifs and calligraphy. Above these tiles is a band of sculpted stucco decoration in traditional motifs, and above this a canopy of sculpted wood. Right above the summit of the doorway's arch is an Arabic inscription in tilework which records the date of the building's foundation: > .الحمد لله وحده والصلاة والسلام على من لا نبي بعده، وضع هذا الباب المبارک > عام ثلاثة و مائة وألف وعشرون \\"Praise to God only, may God bless the one > after whom there will be no more prophets. This blessed door was built in > the year 1123.\\" Inside, the building is centered around a large courtyard with a disposition similar to the interior of the Funduq al-Najjariyyin. The building has three floors (including the ground floor). On the southern wall of the ground floor, opposite the entrance, is a monumental decorative niche covered in zellij, carved stucco, and sculpted wood, reminiscent of decorated street fountains. The courtyard is ringed by a gallery which stretches across all three floors and whose pillars are adorned, in their upper parts, with more carved stucco decoration. This gallery in turn grants access to over two dozen rooms distributed across the three floors.

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), Direct Current (C), Passenger traffic (P) engine, 1st generation (1). They entered service in 1930. A total of 22 WCP-1 was built at England between 1928 and 1929. The WCP-1 served passenger trains for over 50 years. With the introduction of more modern types of locomotives and 25 KV AC electrification, all were withdrawn by early 1980s. Today one locomotive is preserved with the remainder of the units scrapped.  History  The electrification of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway began in 1922. Powerful locomotives were required to transport the express trains on the mountain railway to overcome the Western Ghats. They also had to be able to reach speeds of 85 miles an hour (137 km / h) \\\\- a very high speed at that time, which was not even the case with the E 501 and 502 of the Paris-Orleans Railway had been requested.

The research resulted in a feature film, exhibition and book.  Austro Sino Arts program  Birk studied Digital art and Photography at the University of West London and after completing his Bachelor’s degree in 2005, he moved to Beijing. Alongside Austrian artists and professor Karel Dudesek, Birk co-founded the Austro Sino Arts Program (ASAP). ASAP operated out of Beijing between 2008 and 2014, organizing exhibitions, film festivals and publications. The program showcased the work of non-Chinese artists who worked in China and produced artists’ perspectives on China. The project received major support from the Austrian Arts Council. During his years in China, Birk founded a commercial photography studio, taught photography and exhibited his artworks widely. He also produced a series and monograph titled Polaroids from the Middle Kingdom.  SewonArtSpace  In 2011, Karel Dudesek and Birk founded SewonArtSpace in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. SewonArtSpace is a non-profit art space and residency program hosting primarily Austrian artists and connecting them to the local art scene in Yogyakarta, one of South East Asia’s most thriving art cities. The project received funding from the Austrian Chancellery office.  Afghan Box Camera project  In 2011, Birk returned with his colleague Sean Foley to Afghanistan to investigate the last remaining Box Camera photographers working on the streets of Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan and Peshawar, Pakistan. They conducted research trips between 2011 and 2014 resulting in an online archive, the book Afghan Box Camera (Dewi Lewis, UK, 2013) and the book Photo Peshawar (Mapin, India, 2017). Birk and Foley coined the terms Afghan Box Camera and Kamra-e-Faoree, two descriptions for Box Camera photography. This was primarily through the widespread media coverage, open-source films and ‘how to build an Afghan Box Camera’ manual published on social media and on their own platform.  Myanmar photo archive  Birk started collecting photographic material and conducting research on photographic history in Myanmar in 2013. Since then, he has founded the first public photographic archive focusing on local Myanmar Visual History, the Myanmar Photo Archive (MPA). MPA is organizing exhibitions with the materials in the archive – currently comprising 20,000 images – and has started a photo book publishing program in Yangon. The books are published in English and Burmese and distributed internationally. The archive has received major funding from the British Library, the Goethe Institute Myanmar and the European Union in Myanmar.

These kinds of slides can be catastrophic as they sometimes occur near communities of people, often being triggered by weather or human interaction. This form of landslide has attracted the attention of anthropologists, news media, and politicians as a result of incidents that have severely damaged communities and killed hundreds of people since the 1990s.  Causes  People and weather can cause garbage landslides by impacting the weight distribution of mounds in landfills, which are sometimes poorly regulated and open to those seeking recyclables for profit. Human interaction can destabilize precarious mounds of garbage as people walk atop them or attempt to remove valuable materials. Such dangerous mounds are frequently found on slopes and hillsides, where landfills often exist due to the lack of value for other development. Impoverished communities may be drawn to build homes near such landfills for extant recycling opportunities, and informal neighborhoods have developed in high-risk areas as a result. People collecting garbage are thus commonly both triggers and victims of garbage landslides, but these events can also be caused by landfill workers driving heavy machinery nearby or adding too much trash to the mounds. Weather is a common agitator and cause of garbage landslides. Mounds may collapse if they become heavier from rain and disturbances like strong storms can both trigger sliding and start fires if lightning ignites combustible gases from the landfill. Weather may also induce soil erosion, making landfills more vulnerable to sliding events.  Government mismanagement  Landfill mismanagement and public corruption have featured as significant factors to devastating garbage landslides. If layers of garbage are not properly buried, they remain loose and can gradually separate from the effects of weather and people. Poor waste management policies of different governments at local and national levels contribute to a lack of regulation enabling irresponsible dumping and hazardous access to landfills. Poverty in a society is a very important risk factor as the lack of more stable income can motivate people to collect recyclables from or live in such hazardous sites. As of 2017, around 15 million people lived and worked within such landfills.  Notable examples  Cranes were used to remove debris after the 2015 Shenzhen landslide. Several garbage landslides have occurred worldwide since the 1990s in which nearby infrastructure was destroyed or mass casualties occurred. Examples from the 90s include a 1993 methane explosion at a landfill in Istanbul's Ümraniye district, which triggered a landslide that killed 30 people, and a 1996 garbage slide in Ohio at the Colerain Township landfill which destroyed an adjacent limestone quarry. The latter landslide resulted in a 35-acre fire after lightning ignited combustible waste fumes. These accidents have become more common and more deadly in the twenty-first century. On 21 July 2000 a garbage mound at the Payatas Sanitary Landfill collapsed and slid through the barangay of Payatas outside Quezon City, Philippines, which resulted in the deaths of over 300 people. The tragedy resulted in the Philippine Congress banning all open-air garbage dumps throughout the country. Urban settings can also be affected by these events: During the 2015 Shenzhen landslide a 100-meter tall garbage mound collapsed into a slide and destroyed 33 buildings, some of them multistoried concrete structures, in the Hengtaiyu Industrial Park of Shenzhen in addition to rupturing part of the West–East Gas Pipeline. 45 individuals ultimately faced charges for the disaster and 20 public officials who oversaw the creation and management of the Shenzhen landfill later received prison sentences for corruption. Incidents such as the aforementioned slides attracted local and international outcry, but many smaller events occasionally strike communities with fatal results and attract little media attention. As populations rise, the volumes of waste that need to be managed grow with them and raise the risk of deadly accidents occurring. The development of communities around poorly-managed landfills has left some populations increasingly vulnerable to garbage landslides, which accounted for 15% of landslides not involving soil or rocks from 1993-2004.

Sawyer was a secondary player for the Cardinals when they made the Final Four of the 1959 NCAA Tournament but improved to become credited as the primary reason for the team's success during his junior season. Sawyer's height of led to an intimidating presence, such as when Western Kentucky Hilltoppers head coach Edgar Diddle remarked before a game that Sawyer was \\"the biggest man I ever saw\\" and must be \\"6 feet 13 or 14\\". During his senior season, Sawyer made a pledge he would not wash his socks until the Cardinals lost a game – a challenge that survived 12 games. Sawyer was selected in the 1961 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers as the 13th overall pick. Lakers head coach Fred Schaus considered Sawyer to \\"be a couple of years away\\" from playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) but expected Sawyer to join the team during the following season. Sawyer began his professional career in the American Basketball League (ABL) with the Hawaii Chiefs during the 1961–62 season.

It was announced on 5 August 2020 alongside the Samsung Galaxy Note 20, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7, the Galaxy Buds Live, and the Galaxy Watch 3. Samsung later revealed pricing and availability details on 1 September. Its the third foldable phone in Samsung's current lineup and arguably an important one as it fixed many problems with the original Galaxy Fold.  Specifications = Design  Unlike the original Fold which had an entirely plastic screen, the screen is protected by -thick \\"ultra-thin glass\\" with a plastic layer like the Z Flip, manufactured by Samsung with materials from Schott AG; conventional Gorilla Glass is used for the back panels with an aluminum frame. The hinge mechanism is also borrowed from the Z Flip, using nylon fibers designed to keep dust out; it is self-supporting from 75 to 115 degrees. The power button is embedded in the frame and doubles as the fingerprint sensor, with the volume rocker located above. The device will come in two colors, Mystic Bronze and Mystic Black, as well as a Limited Edition Thom Browne model. In select regions, users will be able to customize the hinge color when ordering the phone from Samsung's website.  Hardware  The Galaxy Z Fold 2 contains two screens: its front cover uses a 6.23-inch display in the center with minimal bezels, significantly larger than its predecessor's 4.6-inch display, and the device can fold open to expose a 7.6-inch display, with a circular cutout in the top center right replacing the notch along with a thinner border. Both displays support HDR10+; the internal display benefits from an adaptive 120 Hz refresh rate like the S20 series and Note 20 Ultra. The device has 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and either 256 or 512 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.1. The Z Fold 2 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+, which is used in all regions (unlike other Samsung phones that have been split between Snapdragon and Samsung's in-house Exynos chips depending on the market). It uses two batteries split between the two halves, totaling a slightly larger 4500 mAh capacity; fast charging is supported over USB-C at up to 25 W or wirelessly via Qi at up to 11 W. The Z Fold 2 contains 5 cameras, including three rear- facing camera lenses (12-megapixel, 12-megapixel telephoto, and 12-megapixel ultra wide-angle), as well as a 10-megapixel front-facing camera on the cover, and a second 10-megapixel front-facing camera on the inside screen.  Software  The Galaxy Z Fold 2 will ship with Android 10 and Samsung's One UI software; by means of an improved Multi Window mode, up to three supported apps can be placed on-screen at once. Apps open on the smaller screen can expand into their larger, tablet-oriented layouts when the user unfolds the device. Additionally, supported apps will now automatically get a split-screen view with a sidebar and main app pane. New to the Z Fold 2 is split-screen functionality, called \\"Flex Mode\\", which is compatible with certain apps like YouTube and Google Duo along with native Samsung apps.

The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019) Before the critical acclaim and blockbuster success of The Lego Movie, talks for a sequel were already in motion. On February 3, 2014, Jared Stern and Michelle Morgan were tasked to write a screenplay. On February 21, 2014, the studio scheduled the sequel for a May 26, 2017, release. On March 12, 2014, Deadline reported that the first film's animation co-director Chris McKay would direct the sequel with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as producers. Warner Bros. did not invite co- producer of the first film, Village Roadshow Pictures, to return as a participant in the sequel, due to Warner Bros. having now more confidence in the film and trying to keep as much profit as possible for itself. On April 10, 2014, McKay expressed that he would like to introduce more women in the sequel than men. On July 28, 2014, it was reported that on the internet, Chris Pratt expressed interest in reprising his role as Emmet for the sequel.

In February 2015, Warner Bros. announced that the title of the sequel had been changed to The Lego Movie Sequel, and that Rob Schrab, co-writer of Monster House replaced McKay as director since McKay went to direct The Lego Batman Movie. According to an interview at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the sequel will focus on Emmet and his sister, taking place in \\"weird, dystopian version of Bricksburg.\\" On April 20, 2015, Warner Bros. scheduled The Lego Movie Sequel for a May 18, 2018 release date. On June 17, 2016, the film's release was delayed until February 8, 2019. By July 2016, Raphael Bob-Waksberg had been hired to do rewrites of the script.

On September 6, 2017, it was announced that production of The Lego Movie Sequel would begin in Canada on October 2, 2017. It was also announced that Lord and Miller have returned to re-rewrite the script to tackle with gender issues on how a girl plays vs. how a boy plays.

Background For several years a campaign entitled Rhodes Must Fall had worked towards the removal of statues to Cecil Rhodes. A list of 60 statues, monuments and plaques considered by activists to \\"celebrate slavery and racism\\" was published online as an interactive map titled Topple the Racists by the Stop Trump Coalition. In addition to Rhodes, historical figures listed included Christopher Columbus, Sir Francis Drake, Oliver Cromwell, King Charles II, Admiral Lord Nelson, the prime ministers Earl Grey and William Ewart Gladstone. England The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, London, had graffiti sprayed on it over two successive days, including the phrase \\"Churchill was a racist\\"; this alludes to his controversial racial views. The memorial to Queen Victoria in Leeds was also vandalised. On 5 June, a group of protesters sprayed the abbreviation \\"ACAB\\", meaning All Cops Are Bastards, on the memorial to Earl Haig in Whitehall, London; when soldiers from the Household Cavalry in plain clothes scrubbed the graffiti off, protesters shouted abuse at them for doing so. The statue of Edward Colston in The Centre, Bristol, was toppled and thrown into Bristol Harbour on 7 June. On the same day, a protester climbed onto the Cenotaph in London and unsuccessfully attempted to set fire to the Union Flag. A sculpted head of a black man was removed from the 18th-century inn sign of the Green Man in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. The act was performed by residents of the town, who said that they had done so in order to protect it from vandalism. The sculpture was later returned to the local council, its legal owner. In Oxford, a crowd of protesters gathered outside Oriel College, demanding that its statue of Cecil Rhodes be removed. The statue of Robert Milligan on 9 June 2020, the day of its removal On 9 June the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced the formation of the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm, which would conduct a review of the capital's public landmarks. The Labour politician Lord Adonis asked the Government to begin a public consultation on the statue of Robert Clive outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. That evening the statue of Robert Milligan, a merchant and slave trader, outside the Museum of London Docklands was removed following a request from the Canal & River Trust. On 11 June the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, the Guy's and St Thomas' Charity and King's College London issued a joint statement announcing that the statue of Robert Clayton at St Thomas' Hospital and that of Thomas Guy at the hospital named after him would be removed from public view. A statue of an exoticised black man in a kneeling position was removed from the forecourt of Dunham Massey Hall near Altrincham in Greater Manchester. A statue of Robert Baden-Powell in Poole, Dorset, was slated for temporary removal after criticism over events during his army career and his comments of support concerning Adolf Hitler and Mein Kampf, but initial attempts to remove it faced technical difficulties and local people later protected the statue from both council workers and activists. The Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy raised concerns about the Empire murals (1914–1921) by Sigismund Goetze in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in a letter to the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab. The bust of Haile Selassie in Wimbledon, photographed in 2019 Following the toppling of the statue of Ras Makonnen, a functionary of the Ethiopian Empire, in Harar, Ethiopia, a bust of his son Haile Selassie was toppled in Cannizaro Park, Wimbledon, South West London. Demonstrations had spread across Ethiopia following the murder of Oromo singer and activist Hachalu Hundessa on 29 June 2020. The bust in London was destroyed by Oromo activists. The statue of Robert Clive in Shrewsbury was the subject of two petitions in favour of its removal and one against; the first two combined received a greater number of signatures than the third. Shropshire Council voted 28–17 against taking any action to remove the statue. Scotland There were protests against the Melville Monument in Edinburgh due to the disputed belief that Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, whom it commemorates, led to a delay in the abolition of slavery, and due to his long association with the slave trade. Graffiti was sprayed onto the monument and calls were made for it to be taken down. In a number of streets in Glasgow, activists placed new name placards under the names of streets named after individuals with connections to the slave trade. Among these is Buchanan Street, named after Andrew Buchanan, who owned plantations in Virginia, which was renamed to George Floyd Street. A statue of Robert the Bruce located at the Bannockburn Visitor Centre was defaced with graffiti on June 12. Wales Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council announced \\"an urgent review of all local authority-owned sites and buildings in the county borough to determine what statues, busts, plaques and memorials are present at these locations. If it is the case that any of these may be deemed inappropriate then we will be requesting officers to ensure that they are removed from those particular locations\\". A statue of Thomas Picton is part of a display of statues named \\"Heroes of Wales\\" in Cardiff's City Hall, unveiled in 1916. In June 2020 the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Dan De'Ath, and the leader of Cardiff Council, Huw Thomas, supported calls to remove the statue due to Picton's treatment of slaves. A campaign to remove Picton's monument in Carmarthen also arose. A plaque in Brecon dedicated to Thomas Phillips, the captain of the slave ship Hannibal, was removed by an unknown person. Brecon town council said in a statement that it would \\"...in consultation with the local community and interested parties will take time to consider what, if anything, should take its place\\". The plaque had been \\"under review\\" by the council before its disappearance but no decision had been made on its future.  Jersey  On June 10, 2020 a statue of Sir George Carteret, a 17th century bailiff, lieutenant governor of Jersey and first lord proprietor of the British colony of New Jersey, was defaced with white paint ostensibly having to do with his role as a trader of slaves for the Royal African Company: \\"the single most prolific trader of slaves.\\" The statue had only just been erected the statue in Saint Peter's Square in 2014 to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey. Thirty-six thousand pounds of public funds were used after a plea for public funds was made by former constable John Refault. While many calls were made to put the statue in a museum. St. Peter constable Richard Vibert committed only to discussing the possibility of place a plaque next to the statue explaining Carteret's connections with the slave trade. In August 2020, the statue was attacked again by vandals who covered it in red paint (symbolizing blood) and chains.

Photostress recovery time measurement procedure is known as photostress test. Normal recovery time is about 15-30 seconds. The photostress test is a simple, easy and quick clinical technique that can differentiate between retinal (macular) and postretinal (e.g.optic nerve) disease. Clinical significance The photo stress test is clinically useful in diabetes, glaucoma, macular degeneration etc. Diabetic retinopathy affects the microvasculature of the inner retina and causes neurodegeneration. Several studies reported that PSRT is elevated in people with diabetes. Recovery time is more in macular diseases (50 seconds or more) than postretinal (e.g.optic nerve) diseases. Elevated PSRT has also been found in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) which is characterized by progressive death of the retinal ganglion cells. Amblyopic eyes with normal fundus also have normal recovery time. Materials needed Ophthalmoscope or alternative source of light (e.g.penlight), stop watch, distance vision charts like a Snellen chart. Procedure * Testing is done monocularly. * Patient is asked to sit in front of an illuminated vision chart, at 6 meter distance. * Initial measurement of best corrected visual acuity should be done. * Locate fovea using ophthalmoscope. * Ask the patient to look at the bright light of the ophthalmoscope for 10 seconds. * Time taken to read any three letters of the pre-test visual acuity is noted. * Normal recovery time is 15-30 seconds. Disadvantages The main disadvantage of the test is that there is no standardization of the procedure. The effect of aging on recovery time is also thought as a disadvantage, but it is still under discussion since some studies found increased PSRT with age, and others did not find any significant effect.

As a member of the Communist Party, she was arrested on 16 occasions for her activities. Early life Virgínia de Faria Moura was born on July 19, 1915, in São Martinho do Conde, in the Guimarães municipality, in the Braga district of Portugal. Her mother, a primary school teacher, was unmarried. At this time in conservative Portugal there was a considerable stigma attached to unmarried mothers. Moura indicated that she was aware of this from an early age, as her extended family cut off contact with her mother. Schoolmates were forbidden to invite her to their homes and even at university she felt marginalised. She indicated that this stigma was a factor in the development of her revolutionary approach. Nevertheless, her mother was accepted by enough people in the community that she could earn a living teaching children during the day and her parents at night, in a part of Portugal where adult illiteracy was high. Moura attended secondary school in Póvoa de Varzim. At the age of 15 she took part in a student strike to protest against the murder of a young student, allegedly committed by the police. Three years later she joined the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and worked with the Socorro Vermelho (Red Assistance), an organization devoted to supporting political prisoners in Portugal and Spain. At this time she met the then architecture student António Lobão Vital, who would be her companion for 42 years until his death. In 1935, Vital was arrested for finding jobs for two Spanish refugees and was stopped from finishing his studies. Later, he did manage to graduate as an architect. She graduated from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto in 1948 becoming only the second Portuguese woman to qualify as a civil engineer. However, she could not obtain a job in the Civil Service, since she was already on police records as an opponent of the Estado Novo. Private engineering projects that she carried out were signed by others. She also studied Mathematics and Humanities, at the University of Coimbra and University of Porto, and in a private capacity carried out some teaching. Opposition to the Estado Novo From 1944 Moura was an active participant in the struggle against the Estado Novo. She was a member of the Movement of National Antifascist Unity (MUNAF), which was a political platform of groups opposed to the government that was strongly influenced by the Communist party; the Movement of Democratic Unity (MUD), which played a similar role; and the National Democratic Movement (MND), which supported opposition candidates for the National Assembly. She was also active with the National Council of Portuguese Women and the (Portuguese Women's Peace Association). The latter was dissolved by the Estado Novo in 1952. In an environment where women were subordinated to their husbands and in some cases still could not vote, and in a country which had the highest child mortality in Europe, women and their status in Portugal was a common theme of Moura's work. Her \\"Letter to a Modern Woman\\" (Carta a Uma Mulher Moderna) was a call to women to participate actively in political life. First arrested on 17 December 1949, Moura was tried for \\"treason to the Motherland\\" in 1951, for having signed a declaration that demanded that President Salazar negotiate with the Indian government regarding the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu. In total, she was arrested sixteen times by the PIDE, the Portuguese secret police, prosecuted nine times, convicted three times and also repeatedly assaulted by the police. The last arrest was in 1962. She became well-respected in Porto to the point that in 1950 women in Bolhão Market went on strike to demand her release from prison. At a trial in 1952 messages of support from Eugénie Cotton, a French scientist and President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and Irène Joliot-Curie, daughter of Pierre and Marie Curie and President of the World Peace Council, were read out in court. She, herself, was held in prison in Porto, in PIDE offices, and in Lisbon's Caxias Prison. Senior male Communist party members were also held in the Peniche Fortress, and Moura organised a protest by wives of political prisoners against the harsh conditions in which they were kept. Moura supported the Presidential campaigns of Norton de Matos in 1949, of Ruy Luís Gomes in 1951, and of Humberto Delgado in 1958 and was a charismatic speaker at public meetings. She became a member of the Central Committee of the PCP and remained in hiding, but also found time to write newspaper and magazine articles under the pseudonym of \\"Maria Selma\\". She was a founder of a magazine called O Sol Nascente (The Rising Sun). As an editor she was fined for having edited a book, Palavras necessárias (Necessary words), by the communist, Bento António Gonçalves. After the Carnation Revolution The Carnation Revolution took place on 25 April 1974, resulting in the overthrow of the Estado Novo. On April 26, she was invited by the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), which had instituted the peaceful Revolution, to accompany them in the release of political prisoners at the PIDE headquarters, in Porto. Inside, \\"some terrified agents burned all the papers they could\\". After April 25 she continued her political activity as a member of the PCP and stood for election on several occasions, being elected to the councils of both Porto and Gondomar. In 1985 she was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Liberty (). This was followed by the receipt of the Medal of Honor from Porto City Council in 1988. Virgínia Moura died on 19 April 1998, in Porto. The funeral of the lady known as the \\"Passionate Portuguese\\" was attended by thousands. In 1999, a bust of Virgínia Moura, by the sculptor Manuel Dias, was inaugurated. The sculpture was placed in front of the building where the political police were based when she was arrested for the first time and was unveiled 50 years after that first arrest. In Guimarães a group of schools bears her name and a street has been named after her, as have roads in several other locations throughout Portugal.

There are two teams, each with a bench, and one dodgeball or large soft ball. A flat rectangular surface is needed, marked with side lines such as those of a badminton court. The size of the teams is variable, but must be the same for each side. Each of them has a goalkeeper who stands on the team’s bench, while the other players take up positions around their half of the court. The ball is thrown into the centre of the court, and a player catches it to gain possession. The aim of the game is to pass the ball around a team five times, then pass it back to the goalkeeper, thus scoring a goal. If the ball is dropped or the other team gains possession, a new count begins. If the ball leaves the court, the team which was not the last to touch it has a throw-in from the side-line.Benchball at primaryresources.co.uk, accessed 12 June 2020 After a goal, the team which did not score it throws the ball in from behind the bench where the goal was scored.

In 1935, she founded the fashion house Kostio de War in Paris, specialising in high quality knitwear and crochet wear.  Life  Lyska Kostio de Warkoffska was the daughter of Serge de Warkoffska and Pétronille Geluyckens Around 1913, the »little Baroness« (French: la petite baronne), the »very pretty Russian« (French: fort jolie russe) or Mlle Lyska Kostio, as she was called until 1918, was introduced into the Parisian high society of the Belle Époque by the actress Louise Balthy. On February 4, 1914, she made her debut at the Théâtre Michel, which today is still located on the rue des Mathurins. In the revue La Sans-Gêne by Robert Dieudonné and René Bussy, she played the role of Lisoy alongside Louise Balthy. The show had more than 20 performances. She had already attracted attention a year earlier by promenading in public using her \\"belly forward and the umbrella under the arm\\" style with Jacqueline Forzane, the future film actress, on the Deauville esplanade. Another eccentric appearance is documented in an issue of the New York daily The Sun, with a photo showing her with her doll collection, with which she regularly appeared in public. She was also known as the “Queen of Tango” She had the walls of her apartment on the Avenue du Bois demolished to create a large dance hall, decorated with painted panels by Léon Bakst. At the beginning of August 1914, when general mobilization was ordered, her dance hall was transformed into a hospice where she and her maidservant nursed casualties of the war. Her daughter Vanina was born on June 2, 1919. Around 1920 she began to use her full name Mme Lyska Kostio de Warkoffska. Five years later, on July 30, 1924, her engagement to Baron Jehan de Tinan Neyevelt was announced in the Parisian daily Le Figaro. But it was not until November 4, 1940 that she actually married in Cannes Christian Charles Raymond Aymar de Rivals-Mazères, a descendant of Jean Racine. The marriage did not produce any children. In 1935, she adopted the final version of her name, Kostio de War, a combination of her middle forename and a shortening of her surname. It was under this name that she opened her first fashion store in at 18 rue Jean- Goujon in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Her first collections consisted of hand-knitted and hand-crocheted knitwear, couture, sports and also fur articles. (French: Trickots, Couture, Sports, Fourrures). In 1938, the store moved to 108 rue Lauriston in the 16th arrondissement. In the same year, she left the Société de War. Her daughter Vanina began to attract attention by producing her own creations and took over the fashion store on the rue Jean- Goujon. During the German occupation, she stayed on the French Riviera and on the Atlantic coast in Biarritz. She remained active and present on the fashion scene. With fashion houses like Worth, Heim and Henry La Pensée, she organized fashion shows such as in the Casino of Cannes. After the liberation of Paris at the end of August 1944, she returned to the capital, locating her fashion business on the 5th floor of a building at 14, rue Clément-Marot in the 8th arrondissement. Her last fashion shop was located until her death on the Avenue Marceau, which connects the 8th arrondissement with the 16th. Kostio de War died on March 13, 1986 at the age of 89 in the Hôpital Ambroise-Paré in Boulogne-Billancourt.  Fashion career  Her collections retain a sober, classic style, but she combined unusual elements with her knitted and crochet items, something that distinguishes her designs from those of other couturiers. The material of her coats and suits is so finely knitted that it looks like woven fabric. \\"Knitwear has long since been promoted into the ranks of the nobility, and its elegance only increases when it comes from the hand of Kostio de War.\\" (French: Le tricot a depuis longtemps conquis ses titres de noblesse, et son élégance ne fait que croître lorsqu’il est traité par Kostio de War.) – Comtesse de S. \\"Gold and blue embroidery (a pot of tulips) make both pockets remarkable by providing a very refined ornamental touch. Buttons of golden metal, scarf of gold thread... It's young, classical and very personal... These are qualities that are found in every costume made by Mme Kostio de War.\\" (French: Une broderie or et bleu (un pot de tulipes) fait à la fois poches et ornement très raffiné. Boutons de métal or, écharpe de fils d'or... C'est jeune, Classic et très personnelle... Ces qualités, tous les costumes de Mme Kostio de War les contiennent.) – Lucien Lelong She fashioned tight-fitting evening gowns from gold or silver yarns. One of her evening gowns is today in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. A similar piece made out of copper yarn can be found in the collections of the musée des arts décoratifs in Paris. \\"And evening gowns, knitted in silk, mixed with gold or silver, very simple, but nevertheless almost fairylike in appearance. You feel compelled to bend over to look closely, to feel the material... it is difficult to believe... difficult to believe… and yet you are forced to face the obvious; this miracle is indeed knitwear.\\" (French: Et des robes du soir, tricots de soie, mêlés à l'or ou l'argent, robes très simples, mais néanmoins d'aspect presque féerique. L'on se penche pour voir de près, pour palper la matière... on hésite... on hésite, et l'on est forcé de se rendre à l'évidence : ce miracle, c'est simplement du tricot.) – Denise Veber She also created suits, dinner jackets, hats, scarves and caps, sportswear (including clothes for cyclists), swimwear and gloves. At the beginning of 1937, Kostio de War found a small album of knitting samples dating from 1830 on which she based the designs of her own creations. Her designs and accessories were all knitted or crocheted by hand. They were showcased in various fashion magazines such as L'Officiel de la Mode, Elle, Marianne, Femina, Excelsior and Vogue. Her collections were photographed by photo studios such as Studio Franz, Juliette Lasserre's Studio, Studio Waroline and Studio Anzon. There are also images taken by Dora Maar, Jean Moral and Madame d'Ora; the latter took several portraits of the couturier herself. Among Kostio de Wars' contemporaries who shaped Parisian fashion between 1930 and 1950 were designers such as Anny Blatt, Elsa Schiaparelli, Vera Borea, Lola Prusac, Jean Patou, as well as Coco Chanel, Jeanne Lanvin, Marcel Rochas and Jacques Heim. Among her clients and the wearers of her clothes were Gary Cooper, Greta Garbo, Yves Montand, Jean Marais, Louis Jouvet, Claude Dauphin, Annabella and Suzy Solidor. In 2017, the Maison de War was reopened by Kostio de War's great-granddaughter, Sayana Gonzalez.  Theater and film costumes  For the play Baignoir B ou Toute la vérité by Maurice Diamant Berger that premiered at the Théâtre de Marigny in spring 1939, Kostio de War designed the costumes for the actresses Simone Renant, Betty Daussmond, Jany Holt and Germaine Bréty. Kostio de War designed the clothes, including a tight-fitting dark jacket with belt back, worn by the leading actor Marcel Dalio in Jean Renoir’s 1939 film La règle du jeu. In 1952, as couturier, she provided the costumes for Alex Joffé's feature film Lettre ouverte that featured Robert Lamoureux and Geneviève Page.

It was built around 1867 by retired customs officer and amateur astronomer Stephen Carkeek on his farm south of Featherston in the Wairarapa. The timber building was in two parts: an octagonal room with a rotating canvas dome, and a rectangular annex. Carkeek died in 1878 and the disused observatory became a farm equipment shed. As late as the 1980s it was still largely intact, but is now a partial ruin, although the annex and parts of the rotation mechanism can still be seen in place. It was added as a Category I historic place in the New Zealand Heritage List on 26 June 2020.  The astronomer  Stephen James Carkeek (1815–1878) was born in Swansea but emigrated to New Zealand with his family in 1841. He began a career in the Customs Service, and in 1849 moved to Wellington where he was appointed Collector of Customs, and later became the colony's first Inspector and Commissioner of Customs. After an early career at sea, Carkeek retained an interest in naval timekeeping and astronomy, which he pursued through the Wellington Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute. At his instigation the Government built a Provincial Observatory on the waterfront, which connected to a time ball on the roof of the Wellington Customs House. Carkeek retired in 1866 aged only 51, and moved to the Wairarapa to take up sheep farming. His farm, Torohanga, was just south of Featherston, and on it he built a private observatory to continue his hobby of amateur astronomy, for which he was widely known.  The observatory  Built around 1867, the observatory was modest in size and constructed mostly of locally-sawn tōtara planks with hand- made iron nails. It consisted of two parts: an octagonal room 4.57 m across topped by a dome, and a transit annex 4.24 by 3.45 m on its south-eastern side. The annex contained the entry door, and steps up to the dome room floor, which was elevated 84 cm above the ground. The \\"dome\\" over the observation room was likely in fact conical, and was made of canvas over a wooden frame, mounted on iron rollers so it could revolve to compensate for the Earth's rotation. The design of the observatory was a very common one for amateur astronomers, and it is often called a \\"Romsey-style\\" observatory, after the 1871 prefabricated observatory invented and sold by Reverend Edward Lyon Berthon (1813–1899), vicar of Romsey. Both designs – small, inexpensive timber observatories with a rotating sectional dome and an annex – were based on the famous Bedford Observatory, designed by Admiral W. H. Smyth (1788–1865). Smyth's observatory plans were published in his widely-available 1844 book A Cycle of Celestial Objects, which Carkeek may have owned. Carkeek likely housed two telescopes in the observatory: a 4 inch refractor in the dome room, and a transit telescope in the annex, probable 4.5–6.4 cm. The transit telescope would have been used to determine the latitude and longitude of the observatory, as well as regulating his chronometer by observing 'clock stars'; he may also have kept an astronomical clock. With his refractor telescope he could have observed eclipses and lunar occultations, monitored planets and comets, tracked separation and position of double stars, and searched for new variable stars – all common activities of amateur astronomers at the time with similar equipment. None of his records survive, however, and he published none of his observations.  Disuse and rediscovery  Carkeek died suddenly in 1878, and his chattels and livestock were auctioned on 17 December of that year, but the auction notice did not mention telescopes or astronomy books. The whereabouts of his papers and observation records is unknown. The observatory building remained when Torohanga was sold to William Hodder, whose family farmed the land for five generations. The observatory was converted into a storage shed for farm tools; the dome and two walls were taken down but stored nearby. Graham Hodder recalls exploring it as a child. \\"We were told we weren't to play in it or do anything to damage it…I think that's why there's still a presence of ruins there today.\\" For over 100 years it survived unremarked, until in 1987 Wellington amateur astronomer Sydney Cretney learned about it and visited the site with astronomers Tony Dodson and Garry Wilmshurst. Cretney and Dodson both published articles on the observatory, and in 1994 the Wellington Astronomical Society organised a field trip to see it. Although in 1987 the observatory was in relatively good condition, by 1994 the building was a partial ruin. The roof and two walls of the dome room were missing, but the rotation mechanism, consisting of a U-shaped channel and iron wheels, was still in place. The transit annex was mostly standing, as a mature walnut tree had grown up through it and out one of the observation slits. By 2014 the dome room had mostly collapsed, the iron base-ring had broken, and the wheels fallen.

The land that was Torohanga, off Murphy's Line south of Featherston, was purchased from the Hodder family in 2014 by the South Wairarapa District Council for the discharge of treated wastewater. The remains of the Carkeek Observatory was nominated in March 2020 by the Wairarapa Dark Sky Association for Category I status in the New Zealand Heritage List of historic places, as being of \\"outstanding historic significance\\". The proposal, supported by the South Wairarapa District Council, means protection of the observatory will become part of the South Wairarapa District Plan, part of a broader Dark Sky Reserve proposal for the area. The boundaries of the reserve had been expanded to the west of Lake Wairarapa to include the observatory site. Currently the plan is to stabilise and protect the observatory rather than restore it, perhaps building a replica beside it. The Dark Sky Association has also proposed an architect draw up plans so Wairarapa residents could build their own backyard observatories along the same lines. Heritage New Zealand added the observatory to the Heritage List as a Category I historic place on 26 June 2020, with effect from 15 July 2020.

After his first wife died in 1664, Bouttats married Caecilia Renata Stadler on 18 May 1665. In Vienna he worked on various publication projects often in cooperation with other artists and publishers from Flanders and the Dutch Republic. He also did some work for the imperial court including making an engraved calendar and an engraving representing one of the battles of the war with the Turks of 1663-64.Jutta Schumann, 'Die andere Sonne: Kaiserbild und Medienstrategien im Zeitalter Leopolds I.', Walter de Gruyter, 2012, p. 220-221 The martyrdom of father Sebastian Vieira in Japan He was possibly the father of J.

The place and time of his death are not recorded but it was likely in Vienna around 1668 as no information regarding Bouttats is recorded after that date. Work Bouttats worked as an engraver who produced mainly portraits, and to a lesser extent, allegories, some landscape and battle scenes, calendars and devotional works. Most of his works were made after designs of other masters. There have been some incorrect attributions of words to Gerard of works of his family member Gaspar Boutats who signed some of his works with G. Bouttats.

It describes the festive celebrations, including a horse ballet, that were performed in January 1667. Th event was directed by Alessandro Carducci, with floats designed by Carlo Pasetti and a text written by Francesco Sbarra. The book was published in 1667 in Vienna under the title Sieg-Streit Deß Lufft vnd Wassers ('Fight between air and water'). Bouttats designed and engraved some of the prints, including those depicting in detail the floats and a grotto, that were especially created by Carlo Pasetti for the festival.Sieg-Streit Deß Lufft vnd Wassers at Historické fondy Bouttats collaborated on the publication Historia di Leopoldo Cesare written by Galeazzo Gualdo Priorato and published in Vienna by the Flemish publisher from Antwerp Johann Baptist Hacque. The first and second volumes of the book were published in 1670 and a third one in 1674. The first volume described the political and military successes of Emperor Leopold I between 1656 and 1670. It was mainly illustrated with prints made by Flemish and Dutch printmakers after designs by other Netherlandish artists as well as artists from Germany and Italy. The illustrations mainly depict portraits of European monarchs and important aristocrats, castle scenes, battle scenes, maps and ceremonies. Apart from Bouttats, the Dutch and Flemish artists contributing were Frans Geffels, Jan de Herdt, Franciscus van der Steen, Cornelis Meyssens, Adriaen van Bloemen, Sebastian van Dryweghen and Jacob Toorenvliet.

The three pieces were composed by Henry Cow, Fred Frith and John Greaves, and Fred Frith respectively. They were recorded in May and June 1973, and released on Henry Cow's debut album, Legend by Virgin Records in September 1973. Development In 1970 Frith and Greaves began developing a piece that grew out of instrumental fragments and ideas the two had been working on. Henry Cow then experimented with these ideas to create \\"Teenbeat\\". Some of these fragments took on a life of their own and evolved into free-standing compositions. One of them was Frith's \\"With the Yellow Half-Moon and Blue Star\\", an extract of which appears on Legend; the other was Frith's \\"Ruins\\", which was later released on Henry Cow's second album, Unrest. Glenn Kenny opined in Trouser Press that \\"Teenbeats title, and the title of Frith's \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" (also from Legend), reflected Henry Cow's humour at the time. Henry Cow began playing \\"Teenbeat\\" in 1971. Initial performances of the piece exploited its fragmented nature: elements were shuffled around and often interspaced with spells of open improvisation. On the John Peel Show in February 1972 an extended guitar solo by Frith and several free improvisation segments were added. Frith said the band \\"continued to mess with ['Teenbeat'] for years\\", and he called the piece \\"a beautiful living and breathing beast that was always fun to play and had all kinds of hidden subtleties.\\" Recordings of early versions of \\"Teenbeat\\" before its release on Legend appear on Volume 1: Beginnings in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set. They are two undated rehearsals of the piece, and a 10-minute performance on the John Peel Show in February 1972. The \\"Teenbeat\\" suite was recorded at The Manor in Oxfordshire, England in May–June 1973, and released on Henry Cow's first album, Legend in September 1973. It was later remixed by Tim Hodgkinson and Frith at Cold Storage Studios in London in May and August 1980, and released by East Side Digital Records on the first CD release of Legend in 1991. All subsequent CD releases of Legend by East Side Digital and Recommended Records restored the original mix. Composition and structure The \\"Teenbeat\\" suit begins with \\"Teenbeat Introduction\\", a saxophone improvisation duet played by Hodgkinson and Geoff Leigh that leads on from Hodgkinson's \\"Amygdala\\" on Legend. About half way through the track, the rest of the band joins in and it continues until the main \\"Teenbeat\\" piece begins. The music increases in intensity, augmented by a wordless chorus of Maggie Thomas, Sarah Greaves and Cathy Williams (three of Henry Cow's road crew), and culminates in \\"Teenbeats opening tune. Henry Cow use different metres simultaneously in \\"Teenbeat\\". counterpoint sometimes features a bassline. Benjamin Piekut wrote that \\"metrically ... [the piece] skitters all over the place\\" He described the composition's \\"winking 'dance' theme\\", which Frith, tongue-in-cheek, called \\"the inner core of the piece\\", as follows: > The snippet has the guitar and saxophone playing a melodic phrase of 10 > beats, subdivided into 3 + 3 + 4; they sound this swinging tune three times, > with the third extended via Cutler's drum fill into a full 12 beats before > launching into the next section of the piece. Meanwhile, the bass plays a > walking line in four straight 8-beat phrases that cycle independently from > what's happening on top; on drums, Cutler accentuates this 4 + 4 feel rather > than the 3 + 3 + 4 division in the melody. Taken together, these two parts > traverse the same 32-beat interval of time, but segment it into smaller > cycles in two different ways. \\"Teenbeat\\" also features a number of fragments from other Frith and Greaves compositions. These include Frith's \\"With the Yellow Half-Moon and Blue Star\\" and \\"Came to See You\\", plus tunes from Greaves's \\"Would You Prefer Us to Lie?\\" (played on the organ by Hodgkinson) and a piece that would later become \\"Kew. Rhone.\\" (played by Frith on guitar). \\"Teenbeat Reprise\\" follows Frith's \\"Extract from 'With the Yellow Half-Moon and Blue Star on Legend. It begins with variations of themes used in \\"Teenbeat\\", then an extended guitar solo by Frith, which Udo Gerhards said brings to mind Robert Fripp's guitar work in King Crimson. Once again Henry Cow mixes their metres: for example, guitar chords playing at are accompanied by the bass at . Towards the end of the track, the guitar solo winds down and is replaced by the \\"Teenbeat\\" tune on Frith's violin, after which, Piekut wrote, \\"the song wraps up quickly with a bounding bridge to nowhere.\\" Reception and analysis In a review of Legend in The Wire, Philip Clark wrote that the fanfare in \\"Teenbeat Introduction\\" \\"arrive[s] like a bucket of icy water\\". He said \\"Teenbeat\\" follows with \\"pointillistic splashes of sound\\" that become \\"a harmonically secure chorale\\", reaching a crescendo before \\"dissolv[ing] into a collage of rapidly looming jump-cuts\\". Sean Kitching referred to \\"Teenbeat\\" in The Quietus, as \\"uplifting and epic\\". Bradley Smith wrote in The Billboard Guide to Progressive Rock that \\"Teenbeat\\", with its \\"ominous\\" drums and chorale that open the piece, and \\"Teenbeat Reprise\\", with its \\"raging\\" guitar solo, are some of the highlights of Legend. In a review of the album in the Anderson Herald in 1974, Michael Graham Main commented that \\"Teenbeat\\" and \\"Amygdala\\" give the album \\"a unique jazz-rock blend\\". He said Henry Cow \\"explodes with electrical energy\\" on \\"Teenbeat Reprise\\", and called it \\"the album's most developed number\\". Paul Stump stated in The Music's All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock that the placing of the organ and guitars in the stereo mix in the opening of \\"Teenbeat\\" is a good example of the \\"pointillist effect\\" Henry Cow achieved in many of their recordings. He suggested that Frith's \\"blistering and initially conventional-sounding\\" guitar solo in \\"Teenbeat Reprise\\" illustrates the band's incorporation of techniques they learnt from exploring their instruments while improvising. Stump added that the \\"irregular downbeats\\" of \\"Teenbeat Reprises rhythm section \\"encourage[s] a harmonic elasticity\\". Live performances \\"Teenbeat\\" was performed live by Henry Cow a number of times between 1971 and 1978, including: *28 February 1972 on the John Peel Show in London, broadcast by the BBC on 14 March 1972 **Released in Volume 1: Beginnings of The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set *21 October 1973 at the Rainbow Theatre in London with a number of guests *9 June 1974 at the Theatre Royal in Sheffield, England while on tour with Captain Beefheart **Released on Ex Box – Collected Fragments 1971–1978, a bonus CD in The Henry Cow Box Redux: The Complete Henry Cow *13 February 1977 at the Wandsworth Town Hall, London **Released in Volume 7: Later and Post-Virgin in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set *May and June 1977 in Sweden and Southend-on-Sea, England *17 September 1977 with the Orckestra at Festival Nazionale dell’Unità in Modena, Italy *9 November 1977 in Bourges, France *16 December 1977 at Melkweg, Amsterdam **Released in Volume 7: Later and Post-Virgin in The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set *10 January 1978 in Geneva, Switzerland NotesReferencesWorks cited  * Category:1973 songs Category:Rock instrumentals Category:Henry Cow songs ","title":"Teenbeat (instrumental)"},{"id":"64254076","text":"Major General Anders Gösta Hökmark (14 June 1920 – 15 April 1993) was a Swedish Army officer.

Origins  Popley was the son of a Bristol merchant, John Popley, mayor of The Staple in Bristol in the early years of Henry VIII, and was admitted to The Staple himself in 1511. In 1525 he had a share in a Bristol ship but he seems to have been a lawyer by training as he can be found acting in legal cases involving Bristol citizens, and he worked with Thomas More during his Lord Chancellorship. This combination of commercial connections and legal expertise made him suitable for minor diplomatic errands, such as acting as a courier to William Knight, the ambassador to the Netherlands. Early in his career he was investing in land; a will dated 1527 records that he had purchased the manor of Hinton Blewett (Som.) and he also had interests at Felton near Bristol. Three proceedings for debt contracted in the late 1520s suggest that cash flow was a problem at this stage in his career. He secured patrons among the local aristocracy including the Stafford family, holders of Thornbury Castle, Gloucestershire, the Nevill family, lords of the manor of Bedminster and Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, who had property in Bristol. His marriage to Katherine, daughter of Giles Basset of Uley will also have increased his range of contacts.  Relationship with Thomas Cromwell  In the early 1520s Popley formed an association with Thomas Cromwell, who acted on Popley’s behalf in London, and when Cromwell rose to prominence in the 1530s Popley became what has been described as Cromwell’s \\"principal man of business\\". The fruits of patronage followed, such as the grant of the right of presentation to a prebend in Wells jointly made to Cromwell, Thomas Wriothesley and Popley. Above all he was well-placed to benefit from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He was on hand to receive, for example, the moveable property and plate of the Austin Friars near Temple Gate in Bristol and the Franciscans in Lewin’s Mead, and through his influence with Cromwell was eventually able to buy the Austin Friars. The relationship between the two men seems to have been cordial; in a letter of 1522 Popley asks to be remembered to Cromwell’s wife and mother and when Popley returned to Bristol to recover from an illness in 1537 Cromwell told him to \\"do as he thought best for his health\\".  Later career and death  After the fall of Cromwell Popley continued to be much involved in the land market, buying and selling property at Cirencester and Somerton, and he was leased the prebendal holding at Bitton. He also secured the lease of Llanthony Priory’s lands in Wiltshire and was still investing in urban property in Broad St Bristol. Occasional references show him managing his property portfolio into the 1550s. By now in his sixties he also undertook legal commissions including a survey of the manor of Barton Regis, which had been sold by the crown in 1553, and he made a witness deposition about it in 1569. In the 1530s he had lived in Cirencester, moving in the 1540s to Chitterne in Wiltshire and the pardon roll of Elizabeth I reveals a series of residences: \\"late of Thornebury, late of Bytton, late of Chitterne All Saints, late of London, late of Bristoll\\". He was still alive in 1572, when he was acting on behalf of Edward Lord Stafford. The date of his death is unknown.

Finances were slim and the theatre closed for three months in 1937 and 1938 but the following year they created Scotland'd first Theatre Festival just before the second world war started. During the war the theatre was organised and staffed by the company. The actors lived in the theatre and they undertook all the jobs necessary to keep the theatre running. The theatre made a profit and those profits were shared equally with the company. She was a Justice of the Peace and in 1952 she was made an MBE. She died in 1966 in Perth. Under the terms of her will the theatre was offered to the city of Perth for the fixed price of £5,000. This was equal to the original investment in the 1930s.

This internationally accredited NGO was established in 2004 for the purpose of providing life- saving services along the beaches of Karachi (Pakistan). It is the country’s only privately run (free public service), near-shore drowning prevention and rescue body. It employs around 250 trained lifeguards that belong to the neighboring coastal fishing communities.  History  Karachi’s coastline stretches around 40 kilometres (25 miles), covering beaches that include Clifton (Seaview), Sandspit, Hawkes Bay, French Beach, Kanupp Point, Paradise Point, Ras Muari (Cape Monze), Sunehri and Mubarak Village. The Arabian sea which meets Pakistan coastline of Karachi and Balochistan, is extremely rough during the monsoon season which starts from mid-May to mid-August. This is also the time which draws the largest number of beach visitors during the year. Before PALS Rescue inception, there were only 30 designated lifeguards for the Karachi’s 27 kilometre (17-mile) long beaches with 18 to 20 active lifeguards at any given day. Karachi beaches are hazardous because of undeveloped topography. The beach surface is not leveled and modified to minimize hazards. The strong currents have no hindrance due to absence of coral reefs that usually break these currents. Some of the beaches along the coastline have “dumping’ waves” that occur in seemingly calm and low tide sea but hit the beach with strong force. There are also some beaches along the coastlines that have sudden dips and slippery surfaces. The sea is most dangerous in the monsoon season which coincides with summer vacations for schools. It is the time when Karachi beaches see major footfall. The beach goers are mostly unaware of water safety and do not have swimming skills. The lack of water safety knowledge and scarcity of lifeguards resulted in large number of drowning cases yearly. Eventually in 2004, PALS Rescue was formed as an NGO registered under the Directorate of Social Welfare, Government of Sindh (Pakistan). Initially PALS worked towards forming a comprehensive lifesaving setup along the most visited beaches of Karachi, Pakistan. PALS approached the established Life Saving Institutions around the world for guidance, support and assistance. Surf Life Saving New Zealand’s Northern Region (SLSNR), offered to help PALS in set up a surf lifesaving establishment along the beaches of Karachi. In 2003, SLSNR sent an 8 member delegation/team to train PALS’ lifeguards. In addition to training, they also donated essential lifesaving equipment. The SLSNR trained 175 lifeguards including Pakistan Navy and City Government Divers. At the end of the 2 week intensive training period, 64 life guards were issued SLSNR Awards and 41 were issued Certificates. In 2005, PALS became an independently established surf lifesaving service.  International Affiliations  PALS Rescue is an internationally accredited life guarding establishment, representing Pakistan in the International Life Saving Federation (ILS) as a Full Member. It is also closely associated with Surf Life Saving New Zealand (SLSNZ) and holds a membership at the Royal Lifesaving Society (RLSS). SLSNZ delegations usually visit PALS on a yearly basis.  Local Affiliations and Support  PALS Rescue is operating with support and collaboration of the following local agencies: * The Pakistan Navy (PN) – who donated 3 of their lifeguard towers to PALS * The City District Government, Karachi (CDGK) * Commissioner Karachi * Station Commander Karachi  Patrol Statistics  PALS Lifeguards cautioning people against rough waves on Sandspit Beach, Karachi Before 2004, there used to be on average 250+ cases of drowning annually on Karachi beaches. PALS Rescue has been able to contain this drowning rate to ‘near zero’ to date. According to the PALS Rescue available data, they have saved almost 5,500 people from drowning along Karachi’s beaches. They also conducted over 7,000,000 preventive actions providing advice, guidance or direction to people that mitigated against the risk of drowning. It has provided first-aid to over 6,000 people. Its presence along Karachi’s beaches has provided protection to over 8 million beach visitors every year. In 2019, PALS lifeguards saved 176 people from drowning in the monsoon season.  Safe Canal Project  PALS Rescue initiated the ‘Safe Canal Project’ that will encompassed four of Khairpur’s villages. The pilot project was inaugurated in 2019 by Dr. Nafisa Shah who is a Member of the National Assembly (MNA). Under this project, Khairpur’s villagers were provided with safety equipment to safeguard themselves, especially women and children against accidents which had earlier been prevalent along canal banks. This pilot project which is part of an planned, large scale development, connects a buoying net across the width of the canal with supporting poles. Life Jackets are placed along each side. Anyone going close to the canal is required to wear these jackets which safeguards them against drowning and the net will not allow a person to get swept away by the water.  PALS Outdoors  PALS Outdoors is the commercial wing of PALS Rescue. It was established in 2010 and focuses on providing recreational activities and adventure tours to various locations in Pakistan ( focusing mainly in Karachi and Balochistan areas).

The Association's founders were of Upper Hungarian ancestry or committed to the Hungarian community of the historical region, located in modern-day Slovakia.  Objectives  Serving the Hungarian people in the Carpathian Basin and the wider world, the organization seeks to promote the cause of Hungarian culture, the Hungarian language and Hungarian communities. The Association's activities are directed primarily at Hungarian youth.  Membership and organizational network  The Association boasts close to 30 000 members and over 500 local branch organizations throughout the Carpathian Basin, of which some 300 operate within secondary school institutions, close to 200 are tied to localities and approximately 30 are active within universities. The organization's head office in Budapest operatives with 19 full-time, young members of staff and a number of committed volunteers. In the year 2019, the close to 80 activities held by the Rákóczi Association reached out to over 100 000, mostly juvenile participants.

In the interest of this, the organization reaches out to newborns, children in nursery school and those entering primary education. Up to 9000 newborns are welcomed annually by the Association with an infant diary under the \\"Gólyahír\\" Programme. In the Advent period, the organization routinely sends a present, together with thoughts encouraging parents to choose a Hungarian-language educational institution for their child, to over 20 000 kindergarten-age Hungarian-speaking youngsters living outside of the country's borders. During the spring, children enrolled to Hungarian-language schools are provided with a schoolbag, followed by a scholarship symbolizing Hungarian unity handed over personally to some 10 000 Hungarian first-graders at over 400 locations following the start of the curricular year in September. The recognition of nursery and primary school teachers, who play a key role in school choice, also commands an important position on the Association's agenda. The wide-scale social collaboration established in favour of the Hungarian School Choice Programme has seen five hundred Hungarian municipalities, as well as several private individuals and public figures join forces to promote the cause.  Youth activities  The organization's activity focuses on secondary school-age youth, with special view to the fact that a significant proportion of identity and relationship networks are established between the age of 14 and 18. In this period, the Rákóczi Association seeks to expose young people to as many impulses as possuble to help them value their Hungarian identity and build a multitude of inter-Hungarian relationships among each other. In the course of the Association's Student Travel Programme in the year 2019, some 22 000 students from over 600 secondary schools visited another Hungarian community by crossing at least one state border to mark a Hungarian national holiday or memorial day. The age group is served by secondary school students' meetings, weekend trips appealing to pupils from both sides of a state border, summer camps, the \\"Gloria Victis\\" and \\"Cultura Nostra\\" history competitions, as well as support granted to hundreds of grassroots initiatives in local school communities. In 2019, the 17 summer camps held by the Association were joined by 4500 young participants. Based on the request of the Hungarian Diaspora Council and with support from the government of Hungary, the Rákóczi Association has announced its Diaspora Programme each year since 2016 with the aim of providing young people with Hungarian roots living throughout the world an opportunity to take part in camps and educational excursions in Hungary. to build relationships and strengthen their identity through immensing themselves in the Hungarian language and culture. Since 2016, the opportunities provided by the programme are enjoyed by 1000 young people from diaspora communities each year. The organization's activity includes marking commemorative days celebrating the cult of Prince Francis II Rákóczi and the memory of the martyr Upper Hungary politician János Esterházy, as well as concerning the fate of the over 100 000 Hungarians deported and expelled from Czechoslovakia due to the Beneš decrees. the Rákóczi Association was able to purchase the \\"Várhegy\\" holiday resort in Sátoraljaújhely, northeastern Hungary, thanks to support provided by the Government of Hungary.

The lower part of this small valley is served by Chemin Royale (route 368) which bypasses all of Île d'Orléans. Besides the area near the main road, agriculture is the main economic activity in this small valley. The surface of the Moulin river is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March, except the rapids areas; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  The Moulin river takes an agricultural area in Saint-Pierre- de-l'Île-d'Orléans, south of a marsh area which is also drained on the north side by the rivière Pot au Beurre (île d'Orléans) and on the east side by a stream on the side of the Maheu River. This marsh straddles the boundary of the municipalities of Sainte-Famille-de-l'Île-d'Orléans and Saint-Pierre- de-l'Île-d'Orléans.

It burned until it was finally put out on July 23, 2020. A lightning strike from a storm the evening of June 5, 2020 caused the fire. The fire was named after the mountain Bighorn Mountain, which is where the lightning struck and the fire began. The fire threatened hundreds of homes and multiple evacuations occurred. The first evacuations occurred in the Catalina Foothills neighborhood in Northern Tucson. The following day, residents in the Oro Valley section of the Catalina Foothills were ordered to evacuate. On June 16, Mount Lemmon and Summerhaven were evacuated. The main reason for how long the fire lasted was due to the rough terrain in the mountains where the fire was at. Additionally, the dry hot weather of the area made it even more difficult to fight the fire. The first monsoon of Tucson’s monsoon season is credited with helping emergency crews help the fire get under control to eventually put it out.

It stands on a plot between Dinghurst Road and Front Street, and is a prominent landmark at the entrance to the village. Designed by Joseph Foster Wood of Foster & Wood, Bristol, the tower is made of local stone and is of perpendicular Gothic style. The tower has a cast iron clock face on each of its four sides with one mechanism driving the clock hands. The escapement and clockwork mechanism is still in use and was supplied by J. B. Joyce & Co in 1898. The bell chimes on the hour and quarterhour and the mechanism is wound every three days by volunteers. Responsibility for maintenance of the clock tower transferred to the parish council after the original trust could no longer afford to maintain it. The whole structure, tower, walls, and railings, was designated as a Grade II listed building on 19 January 1987, nearly 90 years after the tower was built. History=Inception In 1897, Sidney Hill, a local businessman and benefactor, purchased the old turnpike house, near the Nelson Arms pub in Churchill, and also a house and plot of land between Dinghurst Road and Front Street, near the entrance to Churchill village. Both sites were in a state of disrepair and were unsightly. Hill planned to clear the old buildings and debris, plant ornamental shrubs, and enclose the plots with iron railings; similar in design to the then plantation in front of the nearby Methodist church and schoolroom that Hill had built in Front Street, Churchill, in 1881. Furthermore, his intention was to build a clock tower on the Dinghurst Road and Front Street site to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Design Sidney Hill engaged Joseph Foster Wood , of Foster & Wood, Bristol, to design the clock tower. Hill had engaged the same firm of architects to design the Wesleyan Methodist chapel and schoolroom. Foster & Wood was a busy architectural practice in Victorian Bristol and many landmark Bristol buildings were designed by them, including Fosters Almshouse (1861), Colston Hall (1864), the Grand Hotel on Broad Street (18641869), Bristol Grammar School (1875), as well as a large number of Wesleyan chapels throughout the city. Build The tower was built by the end of 1897, and the bell and clock mechanism were installed the following year by J. B. Joyce & Co. On 31 July 1901, Sidney Hill gifted the clock tower, along with the old Wesleyan schoolroom next to the tower, to the Churchill Memorial Chapel and School Trust. Graham Clifford Awdry , Joseph Foster Wood's former business partner, wrote in Wood's obituary, \\"A charming memorial tower at Churchill, Somerset, is a good specimen of his originality\\". Restoration By March 1974, the wall surrounding the tower was crumbling, and the tower stonework required pointing and cleaning. The clock's winding mechanism was also in a poor state of repair and it would have cost a thousand pounds to mechanise it. The Churchill Memorial Chapel and Schools Endowment Trust, the trust in charge of the tower, had an annual income of £500 and was paid £12 pounds per year by the parish council to maintain the tower. The trust had asked for more help from the parish council, as they had concluded that it was not possible to maintain the tower and the other church properties for which they were responsible. It was recognised that the longterm future of the tower lay either with listing the tower as an historic monument or that the parish council take over the maintenance of the tower. By September 1976, the trust had applied to the Charity Commissioner to have its responsibilities transferred to the parish council. In the same month, John Edgar Howard Smith, the managing director of Smith of Derby Group and the owners of J. B. Joyce & Co, wrote to the parish council offering to carry out a free survey of the clock, although at the time of Smith's letter, the trust had recently refurbished and renovated the mechanism at a cost of £211. In 1977, for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, the tower was cleaned by Arthur Raymond Millard (\\"Ray Millard\\") , former chairman of Churchill Parish Council, and a team of volunteers. In 1979, a plaque was affixed to the west side of the tower to commemorate the work of Millard and the volunteers. Maintenance The Open Spaces and Allotments committee of Churchill Parish Council is now responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the clock tower. A bench has been installed outside the Reading Room in the clock tower enclosure and a new pathway constructed to provide disabled access. Features Commemoration plaque attached to the clock tower. The drinking fountain on the east side of the tower with cast iron tap and water pump fittings. The tower has a cast iron clock face on each of its four sides, with Roman numerals indicating 12 hours on each face. The clocks are attached to a square tower that has buttresses to the first floor. One mechanism drives the faces on all sides of the of the tower. The second floor holds the clock mechanism and bell. A drinking fountain, with a cast iron tap and water pump fittings, is built into a niche on the east side of the tower.

It ran between 1891 and 1911, closing down in September 1911 before the start of the planned 1911–12 season. History The league was formed in 1891. Treharris were the first champions after a disorganised first season which was concluded by the top three clubs playing off for the championship. The next three seasons were affected by unplayed matches; and at the completion of the 1893–94 season, the management committee announced the winding up of the league. For the next two seasons, the league trophy was played for as a junior cup competition. The league restarted for the 1896–97 season and grew in numbers, eventually adding a second division, which operated without promotion or relegation. In 1904 another league formed in South Wales, the Rhymney Valley League, which later became the Glamorgan League, eventually becoming the Welsh Football League. The new league was effectively a junior league, with many South Wales League teams having teams in both leagues. During the 1909–10 season, some of the older teams left the league and the 1910–11 season was problematic. The league announced that 11 clubs would play the 1911–12 season, but the management committee cancelled the season in September 1911 with an initial plan to take a season off. The league never returned.

He was born in Sorn parish at Montgarswood, Ayrshire, Scotland. His father, Henry Richmond, was a merchant in Mauchline and owned Montgarswood Farm that lies near Sorn. This farm passed to James, John's brother, having once been farmed by William Fisher, Burns's Holy Willie. John eventually became a writer or lawyer in Mauchline after for a time being a clerk working for the lawyer Gavin Hamilton, a good friend of Robert Burns and also for an Edinburgh lawyer, William Wilson. Life and character The Kilmarnock Edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect John, the younger son, born in Sorn parish, was educated at Newmilns school having been sent to live their with friends of the family. He finally married Jenny or Janet Surgeoner at Netherplace in Mauchline on 5 August 1791, having fathered an illegitimate daughter with her in November 1785. For this sin of fornication John and Jenny had to face the Mauchline kirk session and the congregation in 1785. He abandoned Jenny having taken a job in November 1785 at Edinburgh with William Wilson, a writer to the signet, an act that Burns strongly disapproved of. Richmond was in poor health at one point whilst in Edinburgh as revealed in letter by Burns and he also refers to him as .. \\"a son of Misfortune. I shall be extremely anxious to hear from you how your health goes on; ..\\". After the death of William Wilson in July 1787 he shortly after returned to Mauchline and a letter shows that he was working as a lawyer or writer in the town by 7 September 1787. John and Jenny lived at No.3, High Street, a house that still stands. Their daughter became Mrs. Alexander who was the source of a story that Robert and Jean were married in the Loudoun Street hostelry of John Ronald, publican and carrier. He died in 1846 aged 82 and was buried in Mauchline churchyard. Association with Robert Burns Burns is thought to have first met John Richmond in 1784 when he was working at Gavin Hamilton's lawyer's office as a clerk. Richmond introduced Burns to James Smith and together with William Hunter, a tanner, the four became close friends \\"Unco pack an' thick thegither\\" and formed the notorious 'Court of Equity' at the Whitefoord Arms, as described in Burns's \\"Libel Summons, The Fornicator's Court or The Court of Equity\\".Libel Summons Burns was the Perpetual President; James Smith the Pocurator Fiscal; William Hunter the Messenger at Arms and Richmond the Clerk of the Court. The court met to debate and discuss the scandals in the village and the punishments that each crime merited. Burns received a mock-summons to stand before the court, the Libel Summons. Richmond, Smith and Burns would often meet at the end of the day and pay a visit to the reading club at Loudoun Inn, then John Maclelland's Inn; discuss politics and events over an ale at John Dow's or attend the debating society. Richmond, Smith and Burns are thought to have been in Poosie Nancie's Inn at Mauchline when the scenes of enthusiastic revelry amongst a group who were beggars by day inspired the poet to write his cantata Love and Liberty or The Jolly Beggars. Richmond was the source of the information that early drafts contained three extra characters, viz Racer Jess, a Sailor and a Sootyman. The Jolly Beggars by Isaac Cruikshank John Richmond's gravestone Richmond was the source of the story that Address to a Haggis was first recited at the Haggis Club in 1785 at the home of David Shaw, a Kilmarnock Solicitor, who lived at Craigie Kirkdyke. The final verse, since modified, belonged to a previous dinner at the home of John Morrison, a Mauchline cabinet-maker. The complete text was printed on 20 December 1786 in the Caledonian Mercury, the first time that a poem by Robert Burns had appeared in a newspaper. Richmond also pointed out that haggis was something of a novelty as a food item at the time. When on 28 November 1786 Burns first arrived in Edinburgh he had made prior arrangements to share a room with Richmond, his 'Mauchline' friend, in Mrs Carfrae's Baxter's Close flat at the Lawnmarket at 3s a week, up from 2s 6d a week that Richmond had been paying. They shared the rent and had the use of a chaff bed, a sanded floor and a deal table. When Burns first arrived in Edinburgh he suffered from a headache and stomach complaint to such an extent that he spent much of his time in bed and Richmond would read to him until he fell asleep. Richmon helped Burns transcribe hos poems and songs in preparartion for publication. John Richmond's house in Mains Street Tradition states that Burns and Richmond argued and that Burns left the flat, however two friendly letters around this time suggest otherwise and Burns may simply have moved to better accommodation and at the time he was anyway planning his Highland tour and spending therefore some significant time away from Edinburgh. Richmond wrote an article for the Train Manuscript which recorded how Burns's friends had informed him of Mary Campbell's infidelity with James Montgomerie of Coilsfield House, brother to the Earl of Eglinton. In December 1817 Richmond was interviewed by Mr. Grierson and related that James Montgomerie and Mary Campbell met frequently in the 'Elbow', a small Mauchline ale house. On one occasion Richmond and some other friends of Burns took him to the 'Elbow' knowing that James and Mary were there together. They waited and eventually Mary exited from a private room, followed a little while later by James. Burns blushed and muttered damn it and suffered much good natured banter. It made no difference and a few days later he returned to her like the dog to its vomit. Unsurprisingly these details of Mary Campbell's behaviour was very unpopular once exposed. A nephew of Richmond is on record as having said that his uncle was an inveterate liar. Burns sent Richmond with a copy of his 'Kilmarnock Burns' with the instruction \\"you must bind it in the neatest manner and never lend it, but keep it for my sake\\". It is not clear whether he autographed it and considering that he didn't have enough copies even for his own family at Mossgiel it was a generous act of friendship. Correspondence In February 1786 Burns wrote to his friend Richmond saying \\"My chief patron is Mr Aiken in Ayr who is pleased to express great approbation of my works\\". He added that \\"I have some very important news with respect to myself, not the most agreeable, news that I am sure you cannot guess, but I shall give you the particulars another time\\". He was referring to his intentions of an irregular marriage with Jean that, although enacted, came to nothing. See Gavin Hamilton for the full details. The Abbot's Tower and Gavin Hamilton's house at Mauchline. On 9 July 1786 he shared with Richmond the news that \\"I have waited on Armour since her return home, not by -- from any the least view of reconciliation, but merely to ask for her health; and to you I will confess it, from a foolish, hankering fondness very ill-plac'd Indeed. The Mother forbade me the house; nor did Jean shew that penitence might have been expected. However, the Priest, I am inform'd will give me a Certificate as a single man, If I comply with the rules of the Church, which for that very reason I intend to do\\". On 30 July 1786 Burns wrote to Richmond from Old Rome Foord where the poet was hiding from the warrant that James Armour had taken out against him in regard of Jean Armour's pregnancy. My hour is now come. You and I will never meet in Britain more. --., have orders within three weeks at farthest to repair aboard the Nancy, Captain Smith from Clyde, to Jamaica, and to call at Antigua. This, except to our friend Smith, whom God long preserve, Is a secret about Mauchline. Would you believe it? Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail till I find security or an enormous sum\\". Full view of the Naysmith portrait of 1787, Scottish National Portrait Gallery On 1 September 1786 Burns expressed his displeasure at the way that Richmond had treated Jenny saying \\"I saw Jenny Surgeoner of late, and she complains bitterly against you. You are acting very wrong, My friend; her happiness or misery is bound up in your affection or unkindness. Poor girl! She told me with tears in her eyes that had been at great pains since she went to Paisley, learning to write better; just on purpose to be able to correspond with you; and had promised herself great pleasure in your letters. Richmond, I know you to be a man of honour, but this conduct of yours to a poor girl who distractedly loves you, and whom you have ruined, forgive me, my friend, when I say it is highly inconsistent with manly INTEGRITY that I know your bosom glows with\\". By 1 September Burns also wrote that he felt that the warrant for his arrest would not be acted upon and that having missed 'The Nancy' he would take 'The Bell' to Jamaica, a ship whose master was Captain Cathcart. Jean Armour gave birth to twins on 3 September 1786 and Burns wrote to Richmond saying \\"Wish me luck, dear Richmond! Armour has just brought me a fine boy and girl at one throw. God bless the little dears!\\" Burns, on the 27 September 1786 wrote that \\"I am going perhaps to try a second edition of my book. If I do, it will detain me a little longer in the country; if not, I shall be gone as soon as harvest is over\\". 7 February 1787 saw Burns writing from Edinburgh commenting that \\"I have not got, nor will not for some time, get the better of my bruised knee; but I have laid aside my crutches. A lame Poet is unlucky; lame verses is an every day circumstance. I saw Smith lately' hale and hearty as formerly. I have heard melancholy enough accounts of Jean; 'tis an unlucky affair\\". 7 July 1787 saw Burns writing that \\"I have lately been rambling over by Dumbarton and Inverary, and running a drunken race on the side of Loch Lomond with a Wild Highlandman; his horse, which had never known the ornaments of iron or leather, zigzagged across before my old spavin'd hunter, whose name is Jenny Geddes, and down came the Highlandman, horse and all, and down came Jenny and my Bardship; so I have got such a skinful of bruises and wounds, that I shall at least be four weeks before I dare venture on my journey to Edinburgh\\". On 25 October 1787 Burns wrote a somewhat strangely worded letter to Richmond at Mauchline, back home during the long summer recess, from Edinburgh saying \\"I long much to hear from you, how you are, what are your views and how your little girl comes on. By the way, I hear I am a girl out of pocket and by careless, murdering mischance too, which has provoked me and vexed me a great deal. I beg you will write me by post immediately on receipt of this, and let know the news of Armour's family, if the world begin to talk of Jean's appearance any way\\". He was concerned that Jean's second pregnancy would create a new round of difficulties with her parents.

It was the first of a series of lighthouses that were built in the 19th century on the Aran Islands, but it was poorly positioned and was eventually replaced by the Inisheer Lighthouse and the Eeragh Lighthouse. Its deactivation also resulted in the construction of another lighthouse on Straw Island. History Inishmore was the first lighthouse built on the Aran Islands and was completed in 1818 in the centre of the island near Dun Oghil. Located on a hill 122m above sea level, it was designed to guide shipping past the island chain, but it became apparent that it was poorly positioned. Firstly, because it could not be seen at the hazardous ends of the Aran Islands chain, where the North and South Sound approaches were located, and secondly, its location on the highest point of the island also meant it could be obscured in poor weather conditions. Requests from the Revenue Commissioners to the Ballast Board, the predecessor of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to relocate the light went unheeded. Evidence collected for the Port of Galway in 1845 by a Royal commission on Tidal Harbours, included that from Captain White of the Royal Navy, who complained that \\"The light at Arran is perched too high; it is 413 feet above the level of the sea. Captains of vessels often see the rocks before the light.\\" Another Captain, James Price stated \\"that running in, in a gale of wind, the present light on Arran is no good, but ought to be placed on Brannagh Island\\". There were also concerns about the colour of the tower \\"The lighthouse is painted white, which, seen against the sky is the least distinct that could be adopted for hazy weather, or any weather, except when the sun shines bright\\". In 1850 the Galway Harbour Commissioners asked the Board to construct a new lighthouse at the north-west end of the islands. To meet this request, it was determined that the best approach was to construct two lighthouses, one on Inisheer and the other, the Eeragh Lighthouse, on one of the Brannock Islands to the north-west of Inishmore. They were commissioned on December 1, 1857, with the Inishmore light being deactivated that same date. Prior to its deactivation, there were representations by the islanders about the impact the loss of the light would have on safe passage into Killeany Bay and the harbour at Kilronan. It was not until 1878, after numerous requests for a new lighthouse were denied, that one was finally commissioned on nearby Straw Island. Operation It had a rotating optic that gave it a flashing characteristic in order to differentiate it from Loop Head and Clare Island, which were both static lights. In his 1831 book, The British Pharos, Alan Stevenson noted that \\"This light revolves and is seen at the distance of five or six leagues, or at lesser distances in hazy weather, The light appears once in every three minutes in its brightest state, like a star of the first magnitude, and, gradually becoming less luminous, is eclipsed.\\" This was achieved by having an \\"optic [that] had three faces each with seven oil lamps and catoptric reflectors which when revolved gave a 30 second flash every three minutes.\\". Although no longer an aid to navigation, the tower is still clearly visible to mariners and mentioned in a description of sailing directions for the West coast of Ireland. Listed buildings Aerial view of the ring fort and lighthouse in the middle distance The lighthouse tower is listed within the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, where it is noted \\"Unusually sited inland, this lighthouse dominates views in the middle of Árainn\\". Access Positioned at the mid-point of the island, the tower is located next to a Napoleonic era signal tower with the Ring fort of Dún Eochla nearby. Visitors have found the compound and tower open.

She won the Uttar Pradesh Sahitya Akademi Award as well as the Soviet Land Nehru Award. Early life Razia Dilshad was born in Ajmer, Rajasthan on 15 October 1918 in an academic family. Her father was the principal of Ajmer Islamia College. She received an undergraduate degree in Ajmer. She married Sajjad Zaheer, a poet and communist activist, when she was 20. He was one of the founders of the Progressive Writers Association (PWA), and was not interested in pursuing a career in law that he had trained for. Shortly after their marriage, he was arrested by the British for his revolutionary activities and imprisoned for two years. Razia obtained a postgraduate degree from Allahabad University. In the 1940s, Razia and her husband were in Bombay, where they were active in the cultural sphere, organising weekly PWA soirees. She acknowledged the influence of the PWA in radicalising her politics, and was among the activist women who were beginning to question \\"Gandhian ideologies of women's nature and place.\\" By 1948, Razia had four daughters, and her husband was in Pakistan at the behest of the Communist Party of India, which had supported the Partition of India. She moved to Lucknow with her daughters. Career In Lucknow, Razia began to teach, write and translate in order to earn a living. She translated about 40 books into Urdu. Her translation of Bertold Brecht's Life of Galileo to Urdu was called powerful. She translated Siyaram Sharan Gupta's Nari (published as Aurat (Woman) by Sahitya Akademi), and Mulk Raj Anand's Seven Years (Saat Saal, 1962). In 1953, her novella Sar-e-Sham was published, Kante (Thorns, a novel) was released in 1954, while Suman (another novel) came out in 1964. She edited and published her husband's letters to her from prison, Nuqush-e-Zindan (1954). She worked on a novel on the poet Majaz Lucknowi, which remained unfinished. Along with her literary endeavours, she also edited and copied her husband's writings. Her short stories have been characterised as having a socialistic purpose. For example, in Neech (Lowborn) she explored class differences between a privileged woman and a fruit-seller, and the prejudices the former has to set aside to obtain strength from the latter. Moreover, given the revolutionary ideology of the PWA, her works - as those of her colleagues in the group - explored gender relations and women's oppression by men and other women, the development of a modernist identity among women, as well as the more deleterious effects of poverty and ostracism on marginalised women. Zard Gulab (The Yellow Rose, 1981) and Allah De Banda Le (God gives, Man takes, 1984) were two of her short story collections published posthumously. Later life Razia's husband was in prison in Pakistan until 1956, whereupon he returned to India and joined his family in Lucknow. In 1964, they moved to Delhi. Sajjad died in USSR in 1973.

A teacher by profession, she first served in the Second Assembly as a representative for Aveiro in 1980 as a member of the Socialist Party of Portugal (PS) and was re-elected at all subsequent elections. During her time in the Assembly she was a representative of Portugal to the Inter- parliamentary Union (IPU), and was vice president of the IPU’s Democracy and Human Rights Commission. She also served on many of the committees of the Assembly, including those looking at Foreign Affairs, National Defence, and Agriculture and the Sea, where she advocated strongly for protection to be given to the use of traditional fishing gear. Her resignation from the 13th Assembly in 2018 was slightly controversial. She announced that she was leaving because her daughter had given birth to triplets and supporting this large extension of her family was inconsistent with her parliamentary work. However, she was at the time encountering heavy criticism from her party and others for the number of times she had been absent from the Assembly in December and was in danger of being sanctioned by her party. She replied to the accusations by saying that her absences in December 2018 were because she had to assist her daughter and that, at that time, she had already initiated the necessary steps to retire.

It is located in General Roca, province of Río Negro (Mendoza and Perú). It has got 800 students, but with the Department of Foreign Languages for Specific Purposes (DIEPE), located in the city of Neuquén, gives services to the over 35,000 active students attending its courses in any of the 76 undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas offered in the different academic units in the provinces of Río Negro and Neuquén.  History  The School of Languages was founded in 1962 by Prof. Haydeé Massoni to commemorate the creation in 1962 of the Higher Institute of Teacher Training, dependen ton the Higher Counsel of Education of the Province of Río Negro. The courses of studies offered were Training of Teachers of English, Training of Teachers of French, Pedagogy, Training of Teachers of Spanish and Literature. In 1972, with the creation of the National University of Comahue, the Higher Institute of Teacher Training became part of the general structure of the National University of Comahue as the School of Teacher Training, dependent on the School of Education Sciences. It was situated in General Roca and it offered two diplomas, namely Training of English Teachers and Training of French Teachers. In 1973, the School of Humanities starts exercising administrative and academic control over the STT. Two years later, the Training of English Teachers is incorporated by the School of Modern Languages and starts depending on the Regional University Centre, located in General Roca. This department lacked legal and academic status because it had been created by an internal regulation of the School of Social Sciences. However, this did not prevent neither the start of lessons nor the beginning of activities of academic research and extension. This led to the creation of the Higher School of Languages on the 25th of August in the year 1977, dependent on the Rector's office. In May in the year 2010 the Higher School of Languages became the School of Languages (Res. AU 0001/09).  Undergraduate diplomas= Sworn Translator of English Training Course  One of the undergraduate diplomas awarded at the Department of Languages is the Sworn Translator of English Diploma, Syllabus 499/2001. This diploma is five years-long and consists of 35 subjects and 2 workshops. Any student willing to be awarded this degree must pass all thirty-four subjects and both workshops. The current syllabus (499/2011) came into full force and effect in 2011. There is no entrance exam to start attending this program. The only requirement is to have been awarded a secondary school diploma.  English Teacher Training Course  The other undergraduate diploma awarded at the School of Languages is the English Teacher, Syllabus 430/09. This diploma is four years-long, and consists of 31 subjects and 6 workshops. Any student willing to be awarded this degree must pass all thirty-one subjects and six workshops. The diploma awarded enables graduates to teach English at kindergarten, primary schools and secondary schools, as well as in tertiary schools and universities, both public and private.  Translation Service  The Translation Service is made up of teachers of the Department of Translation, advanced students and alumni of the Sworn Translator of English Training Course. It was created to provide services of interpreting and written translation to all academic units within UNCo, the Rector's office, the Academic Secretary and particular individuals. On the other hand, it offers a means of training for advanced students of the Sworn Translator of English Training Course of the University, and it aims at being a link among graduates, their first steps of their career and the environment. Among the services offered, we can mention: written translation of commercial and legal documents; technical, scientific and literary texts; consecutive interpreting; correction of written texts: correcting style and reading, correcting text structure, text rewriting; transcription of oral texts; among others. The Translation Service was created to give translation and interpreting services of teachers, researchers and other members of the university community; giving translation services to companies and public and private organisations within the Comahue region; contributing to the training of advanced students; being a link among graduates and the environment during their first steps in their careers; and creating a database containing the terminological research undertaken during each completed task.  CELU (Certificate of Spanish: Language and Usage)  CELU The School of Languages hosts the exam with international validity CELU (Certificate of Spanish: Language and Usage).  Research  Between 1978 and 1985, the Higher School of Languages (now School of Languages) began its research activities. The School of Languages, according to the Open Access Act Nº 26,889, has got an institutional digital book repository of open access to host the technological and scientific production financed with public funds, which are the result of the research activities unertaken by teachers and researchers of the university. This repository includes institutional production (technical reports, biographical data, et cetera) research projects, and information on the researchers.  Centre of Translation Studies (CET)  In 2012 the \\"Centre of Translation Studies Bernabé Duggan\\" is created. The translators and the teachers from the Department of Translation of the National University of Comahue submitted a proposal for the creation of a CET and it was approved by the Higher Counsel at an ordinary meeting on June 8, 2012. The main goal of the CET is to contribute to the strengthening of the institutionalisation of translation studies in Argentina.  Academic events  Translation session in 2019  National Congress El Conocimiento como Espacio de Encuentro (Knowledge as a Gathering Place)  Since 2010 the School of Languages organises this congress in its General Roca location. To date, 5 editions have been organised. The goal of this congress is to create a space where professionals and advanced students from the university community from UNCo, from other universities, from primary and from secondary schools can share their experiences.  JOIN FadeL  Since 2017, advanced students from the undergraduate diplomas of the School of Languages organise and take part in the Jornadas de Jóvenes Investigadores de la Facultad de Lenguas (Sessions of Young Young Researchers of the School of Languages). Their aim is to create a space for exchanging research papers produced during their training. For this reason these events are a first approach to the research work, one of the features of the profile of university graduates.  Patagonian Sessions of Formal Linguistics  Since 2011, the Master's Degree of the School of Languages coordinates the Patagonian Sessions of Formal Linguistics in General Roca. These are aimed at undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as researchers. The latest edition took place in April 2019 and the organising commission was made up of Andrea Bohrn (UBA/UNGS), Gonzalo Espinosa (UNComahue/IPEHCS-CONICET) and María Mare (UNComahue/IPEHCS-CONICET).  Translation Sessions of the Comahue  Since 2017, the School of Languages of the UNCo hosts the Sessions for Translators. These sessions aimed at translation professionals, students and teachers were created to visibilise the realities of translation within professional and academic circles.

Ultimately, Markle learns from each of the women and undergoes a personal evolution.

Toronto Star, June 8, 2020.  Critical response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 77% rating, based on 13 reviews. The film received highly mixed response from film critics, however, with both favourable and unfavourable reviews. Kim Hughes of Original Cin writes “Brutally candid and frequently hilarious, indie filmmaker Steve Markle’s documentary Shoot to Marry, about his novel search for everlasting love — or more specifically, his search for marriage which may or may not be everlasting — is a balm for the broken-hearted and a great diversion with unexpected gravitas in its conclusion. It’s also a cautionary tale about expectations and how we pile them on ourselves at our peril. What follows is equal parts quest and catharsis.” John Doyle of The Globe and Mail reviewed the film and writes: “It shouldn’t work, but it does and exudes an uncanny charm that makes it highly, perversely enjoyable.” He concluded that “What should be an off-putting premise is nothing of the sort; Markle’s sad- sack act is really just an excuse for an observational doc that illuminates how terribly ordinary and a little lonely most people are.\\"John Doyle, \\"Unsettling but necessary viewing: HBO’S I May Destroy You\\". The Globe and Mail, June 4, 2020. Film writer Raquel Stecher of Quelle Movies writes, \\"Shoot to Marry is a heartfelt documentary that is equal parts introspective, quirky, funny, sad and joyful. Usually in a review like this I would refer to the filmmaker by his or her last name. But this is such an intimate documentary that in a weird way I felt like I really got to know Steve and through his film I made a new friend. I found myself rooting for him from the very beginning and even felt second hand embarrassment at his failures and sheer joy at his accomplishments. Steve is genuine and funny.” Critic Allen Adams of The Maine Edge writes of Markle “And there’s something to be said for the evolution he himself undergoes along the way; even as the rejections mount, he learns about what it takes to be a good partner. Each of these women teaches him something real; they bring forth their respective passions and allow him to view the world through the lenses they provide.” The UK film critic Musanna Ahmed writes in Film Inquiry “Markle provides lots of laughs. With this delightful film, a real-life rom-com, he proves to be a natural storyteller with a gift for finding comedy in every moment. It’s a lightweight premise with heavyweight emotions, underscored by a very effective soundtrack which mixes 90’s rom-com nostalgia with a catchy leitmotif that signals a new start (which happens a lot) in his path to a blessed union.” Writing for Film Threat, Chris Salce stated that \\"when watching Shoot To Marry, I kept asking questions that, oddly enough, Markle also brings up. He questions if his tactic of finding women to be in his documentary while also trying to date them is ethical. He does ask for permission to record their dates, but it just seems like a bizarre request. Markle even compares what he’s doing to a “casting couch.” If you don’t know what that is, Google it with the safe search on as NSFW material may come up. I also noticed that he was attracted to just about every woman he interviewed and wanted to date them all. It comes across as weird and creepy.\\" For Point of View, Pat Mullen wrote that \\"Shoot to Marry might have seemed like a great idea in 2015, but despite Markle’s best efforts to make himself the punchline of his own jokes, the film has a tone-deaf representation of women. Markle acknowledges that his conceit is problematic, and that trying to score a wife by making a documentary about dating isn’t entirely fair to the women who consent to sharing the views about the subject. The interviewees genuinely seem surprised when Markle either goes in for a kiss or asks them for a date before the interviews abruptly end. With all that has happened in the years since Markle began production, Shoot to Marry might have benefitted from a bit more little soul-searching about the women in the film. In a post-#MeToo environment, one has to read the room.\\"Pat Mullen, \\"Canadian Film Fest Review: ‘Shoot to Marry’: Dating documentary is amusing but tone deaf post-#MeToo\\". Point of View, June 5, 2020. Chris Luciantonio of Film Pulse wrote that the film \\"takes on a distinct incel vibe that taints all the awkward comedic moments with antipathy\\", but wrote that \\"however, the trouble with condemning this film hinges, as most documentaries do, on its claim to be reality, and Shoot to Marry’s claims are tenuous at best. By nature all documentaries consist of some editorializing and construction to achieve their verisimilitude, but Markle’s film seems to overtly do so. Mockumentary might be a better distinction, as one too many of his interviews end with a whacky comedic moment that a bad comedian like Markle would write. A blind date ends with her confessing her coprophagia fetish; a grade-school crush has a rant about how she blames her husband for their autistic son; a journey to a sex club sees him mostly talking to other dejected men. All of these are limp punchlines to jokes he forgot to deliver, but Markle tries to maintain an air of reality to his inane experiment that’s more insulting than it is creative.\\"Chris Luciantonio, \\"Slamdance 2020: SHOOT TO MARRY Review\\".

It marks the first episode in soap opera history to be filmed solely using mobile devices, and was self-shot by cast members from their homes as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down production of Doctors. The episode centres around the colleagues of the fictional Mill Health Centre and St Phils hospital dealing with lockdown, and features appearances from relatives of the characters. The scenes take place after the colleagues have been to work, where they discuss the professional and personal impacts of the pandemic on their lives via video chat. The episode also covers regular character Ruhma Carter (Bharti Patel) suffering from coronavirus. Plot Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan) calls Kira Hyde on video chat for a counselling session, while Ruhma Carter (Bharti Patel) chats with son Shak Hanif (Sunjay Midda) online. Ruhma then catches up with Bear Sylvester (Dex Lee), Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers), and Emma Reid (Dido Miles) about events at The Mill Health Centre and St Phils Hospital due to the COVID–19 pandemic. Ruhma tells Emma about her illness symptoms, and Emma suspects it could be coronavirus. Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh) confides in Emma about the anxiety she is feeling due to the pandemic, as does Karen Hollins (Jan Pearson). Ruhma calls Daniel, where she displays further symptoms of coronavirus, and she is later admitted to hospital. Valerie Pitman (Sarah Moyle) lip-syncs to music to cheer Al Haskey (Ian Midlane) up. Karen talks to daughter Imogen (Charlie Clemmow), where Imogen reveals that she has lost her job, and has been unemployed for three weeks. Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) reveals that domestic violence rates in Letherbridge are up, while Shak worries about the fate of Ruhma. All of the team join a zoom call to celebrate Ruhma surviving coronavirus, and Al hosts a quiz for them. Cast and characters * Adrian Lewis Morgan as Jimmi Clay * Matthew Chambers as Daniel Granger * Elisabeth Dermot Walsh as Zara Carmichael * Dido Miles as Emma Reid * Ian Midlane as Al Haskey * Bharti Patel as Ruhma Carter * Dex Lee as Bear Sylvester * Jan Pearson as Karen Hollins * Sarah Moyle as Valerie Pitman * Chris Walker as Rob Hollins * Sunjay Midda as Shak Hanif * Charlie Clemmow as Imogen Hollins * Caoimhe Farren as Kira Hyde Production On 18 March 2020, it was announced that filming of Doctors had been postponed as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, production was suspended indefinitely, and cast and crew members were sent home for their own safety. On 22 May 2020, despite having the government's permission to recommence production, Doctors announced that a lockdown episode was being filmed at cast members homes using their mobile phones. Doctors is the first soap opera to directly address the effects of the pandemic, and the first to film an episode using mobile devices. The official Twitter account shared a photograph of cast member Elisabeth Dermot Walsh holding a clapperboard stating that her scenes in the episode had been filmed using an iPhone X. Despite fellow BBC soap opera EastEnders announcing plans to return to filming in June 2020, Doctors producer Peter Eryl Lloyd stated: \\"I wanted to capture the strange times we are experiencing and present it to our audience.\\" He added: \\"The very specific demands of producing an episode of this nature was a challenge for everyone involved, especially the cast as they were acting straight to camera, with only my voice performing all the other characters, so that certainly required a lot of imaginative work on their part. It was a real team effort.\\" Cast members Elisabeth Dermot Walsh and Sarah Moyle expressed their nervousness at filming the episode. Walsh stated that due to having two young children, she had to completely clean the room shown in her scenes. She moved all furniture out of view, as she felt that her character, Zara Carmichael, would not have such pieces, drawing on their differences. Moyle stated that she was excited to take part in the episode as it was something to do during lockdown, but found the filming aspects daunting, such as lighting and camera angles. She also found getting into character difficult, as she got used to going on set and feeling like character Valerie Pitman. Moyle also found it strange filming by herself, and added that Verie is accustomed to being around other characters. Moyle stated that filming from home was entertaining, but added that her scenes were filmed in a room in her flat that she hadn't yet decorated. Lloyd conceived the idea for the episode in late March, during the first week of lockdown, and stated that the episode took three weeks to complete, with filming itself taking five days. The production team ensured that strict social distancing measures were followed through the making of the episode. Executive producer Mike Hobson commented: \\"We're never afraid to push the format on Doctors as our loyal viewers know, but this episode has been a challenge of a very different kind. To turn it around at this speed has meant coming up with new ways of working and totally rethinking how to make the programme. I'm incredibly proud of the work everyone has put into this episode, especially our brilliant cast who have had to learn new skills, while still giving outstanding performances.\\" Lloyd stated that the cast enjoyed filming the episode, as it \\"gave a real focus after weeks of uncertainty. Everyone was very enthusiastic, and though some were daunted by the set up and the technical know-how, we managed to pull it off\\", and that they were pleased to be working towards something \\"concrete\\" that was guaranteed to be broadcast. Doctors take an annual transmission break during the summer to accommodate the BBC's coverage of sport ceremonies and other daytime dramas, which typically starts in late June, but due to production on set being suspended, the transmission break began after the episode aired on 12 June 2020. Reception When the episode was announced, head of BBC Daytime and Early Peak Carla-Marie Lawson commented: \\"Doctors recently celebrated their 20th anniversary and this unique episode demonstrates why the programme continues to innovate, and remains so popular with viewers. I think lockdown has presented challenges for everyone but it's been wonderful to see the ingenuity within the creative sector and I'm delighted that Doctors is the first British continuing drama series to bring this very exciting format to fans.\\" Lewis Knight of the Daily Mirror said that the episode \\"will make some highly topical viewing\\", while Stephen Patterson of Metro described it as \\"groundbreaking\\" and \\"something of a revolutionary instalment not only for the daytime soap, but for continuing drama as a whole\\". On the BBC review series Points of View, the series received praise from viewers. One stated that they initially dreaded the style of the episode, but that it surprised her, adding that it \\"captured every aspect of this pandemic\\". An ITU nurse said that the episode was well written, and that it accurately portrayed the pressures and struggles that the ITU doctors and nurses are facing, and that it highlighted that a lot of their BAME colleagues are falling ill.

It was founded in 1986 by German Turkish entrepreneur Ismet Koyun. KOBIL Systems employs approximately 200 people, 80 of which are located in Worms. KOBIL specializes in the creation, delivery and management of trusted digital identities, authentication, secure data technology, one-time passwords (OTPs), cryptography and smart card solutions. It provides both software and hardware security measures. These include a banking as a service (BaaS) platform known as mIDentity.one, secure communication and digital signature systems, and multi-factor authentication and transaction authorization devices.  History  \\"KOBIL\\" is a portmanteau. It derives from a combination of founder Ismet Koyun’s surname and bilgisayar, the Turkish word for computer. KOBIL's first development, in 1986, was a personal computer that featured a small additional keyboard. The additional keyboard enabled the user to trigger an encryption or decryption of the hard disk. In 1994, the company had started to develop chip card terminals and offered a range of class 1-3 card readers. In 1996, KOBIL received the world’s first patent relating to digital signatures. It also developed SecOVID and Smart Key, two new authentication and public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions. In 2005, two years after the launch of KOBIL mIDentity (the world’s first installation-free smart card terminal), Microsoft founder Bill Gates referenced its positive impact during a speech in Munich on internet security. KOBIL was awarded the Platinum European Seal of e-Excellence at the 2009 European Multimedia Forum Awards. Three years later, in 2012, it released its first application security technology. This technology took over the mIDentity name in 2014. In 2016 it started work on a secure communication platform incorporating binding and non-anonymous communication, digital signatures, and business process flows. This was eventually released in 2019 under the name mPower. In the same year, KOBIL also released signPod, the world’s first online PKI-based transaction verification device to include a machine to machine (M2M) eSIM card. The inclusion of an eSIM, alongside other software and hardware security measures, meant signPod could be used anywhere in the world. KOBIL participation in Cebit 2012 By the end of 2019, the company’s transaction authentication number (TAN) app was used by up to 30 million people.

Panhellenic sanctuaries were places of neutrality, and were therefore used as neutral places of political meetings between different Greek city-states, places where Panhellenic Games were held, and well as places were different Greek powers could keep their treasuries.Robin Hagg, Nanno Marinatos: Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches Known Panhellenic sanctuaries were: * Athens: Parthenon, dedicated to Athena. * Claros: Temple of Apollo, Claros, dedicated to Apollo. * Delos: Temple of the Delians, dedicated to Apollo. * Delphi: Sanctuary of Apollo, site of the Oracle of Delphi, dedicated to Apollo. * Didyma: Temple of Apollo, Didyma, dedicated to Apollo. * Dodona: Temple of Zeus, Dodona, dedicated to Zeus. * Eleusis: Telesterion, the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, dedicated to Demeter and Persephone. * Epidaurus: Temple of Asclepius, Epidaurus, dedicated to Asclepius. * Isthmus of Corinth: Temple of Isthmia, dedicated to Poseidon. * Olympia, Greece: cult center of Zeus. * Oropos: Amphiareion of Oropos, dedicated to the hero Amphiaraos. * Magnesia on the Maeander: Temple of Artemis Leucophryene, dedicated to Artemis. * Nemea: Temple of Zeus, Nemea, dedicated to Zeus. * Samothrace: Samothrace temple complex, dedicated to several deities; the Great Mother, Hecate, Hermes, the Dioscuri, and Hades and Persephone.

It was formerly known as LAUTECH Library and was established in July 1990, some months after the inauguration of the university. It was set up as one of the academic units in the university. Olusegun Oke Library was renamed after Professor Olusegun Oke, the first Vice-Chancellor of the university. It serves as the nerve center of academic activities in the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso in Oyo State, Nigeria. It houses different sections and units such as the Readers Service Unit, Technical Service Unit, Acquisitions Unit, Serials Unit, Reference Section and Virtual /E-Library. The library allows a large proportion of its materials on open access. Hence, it plays the crucial role of providing users with all the materials and services for the continued support of current research academic priorities. It is a complex of libraries comprising the main library and Faculty/College libraries such as the Medical Library, which is located in Osogbo; Faculty libraries; departmental libraries and the Olusegun Oke Library Annexe.  History  Olusegun Oke Library was established in July 1990, after the establishment of the university with the major aim of supporting the vision and mission of the university in the area of teaching, learning and research activities. At inception, it occupied a small space in the building, now referred to as Bookshop and Internal Audit. The OOL has witnessed impressive physical developments, starting from a building that provided 82 seats between 1990 and 1999, to a building complex with 2,400 seats in 2002, comprising various offices, conference room, store e.t.c. The library moved to its present site courtesy of the then Vice-Chancellor Prof. A. M Salau, JP. FIN. The library, in its bid to serve as the university's main hub for all electronic resources and management, established a virtual and electronic library in 2007 and 2012 respectively. The Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF), an arm of the Nigerian Communication Commission, supported the establishment of the full- fledged virtual library and electronic library in the university. In 2018, library spaces evolved to meet campus needs by the setting up of an Annexe Library referred to as the Olusegun Oke Library Annexe. The aim of the Annexe Library was to meet the academic needs of the medical community. The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) through its commitment to implementing the National Information Technology Policy, assisted OOL Annexe with the Library Software Management System, Ebscohost database and electronic gadgets in March 2018. The maiden edition of the World Book Day (WBD), designated by UNESCO, was marked on March 1, 2018 which was co-sponsored by the library in collaboration with Information Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP) and OXFORD OXION, England. On 1 May 2019, Dr. (Mrs.) Modupe Aduke Aboyade, was appointed as the current and first female University Librarian by the Governing Council of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso.  Collections  The library holds over 42,000 volumes of print collections and 10 million electronic resources in different databases, relating to almost all fields of knowledge within the community. It has collections in the form of monographs, newspapers, periodicals, magazines, journals, inaugural lecture series, reference books, students’ projects, dissertations and theses. OOL acquires volumes of books covering all programs being offered periodically in the university. Currently, the library is subscribed to fourteen different electronic databases.  Administration and staffing  The University Librarian (UL) heads the library. The UL is responsible for the day to day coordination of the library and is assisted by other librarians who are in charge of the different sections and units. The staffing has three categories: professional, para-professional and non-professional staff. While the professional staff include those with at least a master's degree in Librarianship, the para-professional staff include those with a Diploma in Librarianship. On the other hand, the non-professionals in the library include those without any formal library training and qualification in librarianship.  Automation  The library operates an automated system using Koha Integrated Library Management Software. It is used for cataloguing and classifying books and journals while most of the routine activities such as registration of users and charging and discharging of library materials are done manually. Bibliographic details of the library collections are held in digitized formats accessible through computer terminals in the main library. The library maintains the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) representing the holdings of the library and its subsidiaries. The OPAC allows information searchers to access all the library resources.  Major services rendered  The library renders numerous services to its users and community. The services rendered in the library include but not limited to reference services, research support services, twenty four hours reading room services during examinations, charging and discharging of library materials, user education/orientation, photocopying service, reference services, user-driven acquisition services, technical services, serials, internet services, Virtual /E-Library services, information retrieval and literature search services, selective dissemination of information/ current awareness services amongst others.

His studies of bird migration included the identification of flyways along which a majority of shorebirds migrated as well as the phenomenon of leap-frog migration. He established the first bird ringing station in Finland by purchasing a piece of land in the village of Tvärminne. Palmén was born in Helsinki to law professor (Baron) Johan Philip Palmén and his wife Johanna Charlotta Bonsdorff who also came from a family of academics. His mother died when he was less than two years old and his father married again. He went to study at the Helsingfors Lyceum and became interested in science at a young age with encouragement from his uncle Evert Julius Bonsdorff who was a well-known zoologist and educationist. He became especially interested in insects as a schoolboy. He joined university to study zoology in 1864 and worked as an extraordinary amanuensis at the zoological museum. He became a member of the Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica in 1865. He became a curator of the zoological collections of the society in 1867. He travelled with other students to northern Savonia in 1865 and western Lapland in 1867. He graduated in 1869 and joined for postgraduate studies in the faculty of medicine. He made a collection trip to Austria-Hungary in 1870 and helped in editing a book on Finland's birds by Magnus von Wright. This made him shift to ornithology and with the thesis Om foglarnes flyttningsvägar he received his doctorate in 1875. He studied comparative anatomy at Heidelberg under Carl Gegenbaur and took an interest in insect anatomy. In 1876 he developed his ideas on bird migration in a German paper Über die Zugstrassen der Vögel [On the migratory flyways of birds]. He noted the phenomenon of leap-frog migration but based on his experience at some locations where shorebirds congregated along narrow migration routes, he assumed that birds continued along narrow routes throughout their migration. He returned to Finland and taught zoology, replacing the anti-evolutionist F. W. Mäklin after his death. He clashed with ideas on bird migration with the German ornithologist E. F. von Homeyer and published further clarifications and rebuttals to criticism in a 100 page publication. He popularized natural history study in schools. In 1887 he went on an expedition to the Kola Peninsula along with several other scientists including Oswald Kairamo. He established a field research station in 1901 in the village of Tvärminne. He retired in 1908 and was involved in ringing birds until the outbreak of World War I. He was involved in nature conservation and was instrumental in the nature conservation laws of Finland passed in 1917. He was unmarried and died from bronchitis at his brother's home in Forssa. He bequeathed the Tvärminne research station and most of his possessions to the University of Helsinki.

It is named after Sidi Abdelkader al-Fassi (also spelled Abd al-Qadir al-Fassi), a highly important 17th-century Muslim scholar, mufti, and Sufi saint of the city who is buried in the zawiya. The building is located in the Qalqliyin neighbourhood in the south of Fes el- Bali, the old medina of Fes. It was one of several zawiya sites in the city and across the country which were associated to the al-Fassiya tradition of Sufism.  History  The first \\"Zawiya al-Fassiya\\" was first established by Abdelkader's ancestor, Abu al-Mahasin (died in 1604), a Muslim scholar from Ksar el-Kebir and from a bourgeois family of Andalusi origin. Before coming to Fes, Abu al-Mahasin won some favour with the Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur thanks to the warriors he sent to fight in the Battle of Ksar el-Kebir (also known as the Battle of the Three Kings) in 1578. He moved to Fes in 1580 and started a zawiya by teaching in his own house in the al-Mukhfiya neighbourhood (in the Andalusiyyin quarter of the city), which quickly developed into an important center of scholarship on its own. Abu al-Mahasin purchased neighbouring houses to accommodate its expansion and in 1596 converted one of the houses into a mosque for his zawiya, designating his son Abu al-Abbas Ahmad al-Hafiz as imam. The zawiya's teachings followed al-Jazuli's school of thought (itself within the Shadhili order) and those of Abd al-Rahman al- Majdub (died 1569), an earlier Sufi sheikh who spent time in Fes and who was Abu al-Mahasin's teacher. Abu al-Mahasin's younger brother, Abd al-Rahman al-'Arif al-Fassi (died 1626), became his spiritual successor. He established a second zawiya in the Qalqliyin neighbourhood in the Qarawiyyin quarter of Fes. This second site was devoted to initiating new disciples and to more esoteric practices like the sama', while the original site in the Andalusiyyin quarter became associated with more public and institutional aspects of their order. During the 17th century century the Zawiya al-Fasiyya dominated the spiritual life of Fes and took on added sociopolitical importance. Some of the other disciples of Abu al-Mahasin also founded new branches of the zawiya across Morocco, the most important of which was in Ksar el-Kebir. One of them, Muhammad al-Ma'an, established his own zawiya in the al-Mokhfiya neighbourhood, the Zawiya al-Ma‘aniyya. Abdelkader al-Fasi (full name: Abu Mohammed, Abu Sa'ud Abd al-Qadir al-Fasi ibn Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Abu al- Mahasin Yusuf al-Qasri al-Fasi) was Abu al-Mahasin's grandson and was born in Ksar el-Kebir, before moving to Fes to study under Abd al-Rahman al-'Arif al- Fassi (his grand-uncle). After the latter died, he took over the Zawiya al- Fassiya in the Qalqliyin neighbourhood while becoming a disciple of Muhammad al-Ma'an. Abdelkader's learning and influence grew, however, and he came to be regarded as a reformer and reviver of Sufism in Fes during a troubled period for the city in the early reign of Moulay Ismail (late 17th century). He was a complex figure who, in addition to promoting Sufism, devoted himself also to the study of hadiths and became acknowledged as a master scholar of conventional Islamic sciences too, earning him the title of Shaykh al-Jama'a (\\"Master of the Community\\"). His teachings included a critical perspective on the political elites of his time (who nonetheless admired him) and an emphasis on intellectual or scholarly Sufism which was passed down to the generations after him. Particularly towards the end of his life, he acquired the reputation of a saint who accomplished miracles. Abdelkader died in 1680 and was buried in a tomb in his zawiya in the Qalqliyin area, which has since been known as the Zawiya of Sidi Abdelkader al-Fassi. (The older \\"Zawiya al-Fassi\\", in the Mukhfiya neighbourhood, remained known as the Zawiya of Abu al-Mahasin al-Fassi, after its original founder.) The zawiya building was expanded by Sultan Moulay Isma'il who ruled between 1672 and 1727 and was also responsible for expanding the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II in Fes. The zawiya was held in such high regard that, like the more famous Zawiya of Moulay Idris II, it became a sanctuary (horm or hurm) where Muslims were able to claim legal asylum from authorities. It maintained good relations with the makhzen (royal government) and with the common people, allowing it to sometimes play a mediator role between political forces in the city.

History = 1966-1967: The Red Roosters  The history of the group began in September 1966, when Sergey Danilov and Gennadiy Barikhnovskiy were both eighth-graders at School No. 216 in the Kirovsky District of Leningrad. In the midst of Beatlemania and the popularity of rock and roll, they decided to start their own group. In one of their early performances as a duet, they played music from the film Lyudi nad oblakami () at a school event. Soon after, Dmitry Zadvornov, then a freshman, joined the group as a vocalist. In the summer of 1966, the group was joined by bassist Pyotr “Pete” Bezdudnov, a student of the neighboring School No. 501, and drummer Valeriy Sorokin, a classmate of the group’s founders. Zadvornov suggested naming the group “The Red Roosters” after Willie Dixon's blues standard “Little Red Rooster”, which he knew from The Rolling Stones' rendition. The group's only performance with this name and line-up occurred at School No. 216 on December 29, 1966. Soon after, Vyacheslav Legzdin replaced Bezdudnov on bass and the group changed their name to Mify (). The band's first performance under the new name took place on November 7, 1967.  1967-1974: Early years of Mify  Before the members graduated from school, the group performed at their own school, School No. 501, and at the Seltso sovkhoz. Drummer Valeriy Sorokin was replaced by Sergey Petrov, who had previously played in a group at School No. 501. Zadvornov left the group and Barikhnovsky took over the vocals. At the end of 1967, Mify took the second place in a district-wide competition of school ensembles. They went on a city-wide tour and came fourth in that competition. A portion of their performance was played in a radio program dedicated to the competition. The members of Gorizont (), the group that won the competition, advised the members of Mify to join the choir at the Pioneers Palace. Danilov, Barikhnovsky and Legzdin followed this advice and learned to sing vocal harmonies. Mify and Gorizont went on to hold several joint performances. In the fall of 1968, Mify performed in the competition \\"Listen to the music of our city\\" () at the Gaza Palace of Culture and were named the winners. This success gave them access to the rehearsal base at the Pioneers Palace, and the group gradually acquired its own equipment. In the summer of 1969, Yuri Il'chenko joined the group. The first performance in the updated line-up (Danilov, Barikhnovskiy, Il'chenko, and Petrov) took place in October, in the club of the village of Pargolovo. Mify played at dance parties in Pargolovo and Toksovo, performing the English-language pop-rock standards that were popular at that time. Their repertoire included songs from The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and others. The group's few original songs at the time included \\"Ya padayu, padayu\\" (), several instrumental compositions, and a couple of English-language sketches. The group's second full-fledged composition, \\"Sny\\" (), appeared later and was written by Barikhnovsky to the words of his friend Vladimir Pokatov. In early 1970, guitarist and singer Yuri Bushev joined the group. In the same year, Yuri Il'chenko was drafted into the army, and the group was left without a main vocalist. Mify dissolved and the former band members joined VIA acts. After serving the requisite two years in the army, Il'chenko returned and Mify reformed with new members in 1972. From this point on, the group performed original songs in Russian while remaining a non-professional act. In 1973, Danilov and Barikhnovsky attempted to write and stage their own rock opera, Vremya (), about the generation gap. The opera remained unfinished, but some of the songs from it entered the group's repertoire. At the end of 1973, Sergey Petrov left for the army and Viktor Gukov replaced him as drummer. The group's first success came in January 1974, when Mify shared first place with Evgeny Myasnikov's group Zemlyane — Atlas () in a contest of amateur bands in Leningrad, and Sergey Danilov was named the best guitarist. At a contest for amateur bands in Moscow in the same year, Mify performed on equal terms with such groups as Mashina Vremeni and Tsvety, which were already popular at that time. In this competition, Barikhnovskiy was recognized as the best bass player and Il'chenko was recognized as the best vocalist.  1974-1975: Lyudi Levenshteina  During 1974 the group went through several drummers: Victor Gukov, Andrey “Kuznechik” Alekseev, and Victor Dombrovsky. In the summer of that year, Mify fell apart again as Il'chenko left the group. The members began to perform separately again: Il'chenko worked at the Philharmonic, and Danilov and Barikhnovsky played at dances at the White Hall in Pushkin, in a group led by Vsevolod Levenshtein. In March 1975, Mify were invited to participate in several concerts in Tallinn. Danilov and Barikhnovsky hastily assembled a touring line-up, with Aleksandr Ivanov from Letuchiy Gollandets () on drums and Oleg \\"Alik\\" Azarov from Rossianye () on keyboards. The Estonian concerts were considered a great success, and the group took first place in the competition. Following their success in the Tallinn Festival, the group recorded their hit “Madison Street” () for Estonian television. The clip was broadcast in the Baltic states. It was decided to extend the existence Mify for another season, with yet another line-up change. At this point, the group was composed of Barikhnovskiy (bass, vocals), Danilov (guitar, some vocals), Il'chenko (guitar, vocals), Mikhail \\"Michael\\" Kordyukov (drums), Vsevolod Levenshtein (saxophone), and Yuri Stepanov (grand piano, vocals). Levenshtein participated in the group not only as a musician, but also by conducting the group’s affairs, organizing concerts, and performing other production duties. Before joining Mify, Levenshtein had led the VIA Dobry Molodtsy () for two years. Mify existed for some time under the unofficial name Lyudi Levenshteina (). However, the group only performed under this name once: at a jazz concert organized by jazz expert Grigory Frank, the sound engineer of Leningrad television, in the spring of 1975. For this occasion, Levenshtein invited a couple of familiar professional jazz players to play along with the group. At rare underground concerts, the group performed under its real name. In November 1975, having left Mify, Levenshtein also left the Soviet Union.  1975-1979: Yuri Il'chenko, Mashina Vremeni, and Voskreseniye  Yuri Il'chenko returned to the group in the autumn of 1975. Mify adopted a jazz-rock sound, introducing a brass section with Oleg Kuvaitsev and Albert Rachkin on saxophone, Yuri Gantsev on trumpet, and Viktor Musorov and Valery Zavarin on trombone. Sergei Petrov also returned, replacing Mikhail Kordyukov, who had left to join Aquarium. In the spring of 1976, Mify participated the competition for amateur ensembles “Spring Key” in the Gaza Palace of Culture and subsequently toured Moscow, without much success. At around the same time, Mify gave a concert at the Krupskaya Palace of Culture in Leningrad. This concert also marked the debut of the Moscow group Mashina Vremeni on the Leningrad stage, and Mify's set left a strong impression on Andrei Makarevich, the leader of Mashina Vremeni. A couple of months later, Mashina Vremeni again visited Leningrad. After one concert, Il'chenko decided to join Mashina Vremeni and go back to Moscow with them. For eight months, Il'chenko lived in Andrei Makarevich’s apartment and performed with Mashina Vremeni. Several of Mify's compositions entered Mashina Vremeni's repertoire. In particular, the song “Shock” was later published on the disc Eto bylo tak davno (). During this time, Danilov played with the jazz-rock band Dve Radugi () and Petrov played with Yuri Morozov. Barikhnovsky played with his own group in the Leningrad cafe “Surprise”, popular with local music lovers. In early 1977, Il'chenko returned to Leningrad with the rest of Mashina Vremeni. Il'chenko attempted to organize a new supergroup called Voskreseniye () with members of Mify. However, this group did not last long and disbanded after giving several concerts. In the same year, Danilov went to prison on charges of possession and use of drugs, and Mify again dissolved. Over the next few years, Il'chenko participated in a variety of projects. In 1977, Il'chenko took part in the creation of the Soviet Union's first underground rock magazine Roksi (), acting as an editor and journalist. When Mashina Vremeni broke up in the following spring, its members Evgeny Margulis and Sergey Kavagoe decided to call Il'chenko again. Il'chenko saw this as a chance to resurrect his group Voskreseniye, but due to illness, he was not able to take part in the project. The former members of Mashina Vremeni thus formed the Moscow group Voskreseniye. In 1978 Il'chenko recorded an acoustic album Dozhd (), which was included in Roksi's unofficial hit parade. At the end of 1979, Il'chenko joined the official pop ensemble Zemlyane (), replacing Igor Romanov. Ilchenko remained in Zemlyane for a year before moving on to Integral ().  1980-present: Debut album and later tours  In 1979, Andrei Tropillo had started his underground recording studio \\"AnTrop\\" and decided to begin full-fledged studio recordings of Leningrad rock bands. Tropillo conducted his first studio experiments with Mify's keyboard player, Yuri Stepanov, and Olga Pershina. In 1980, Danilov was released from prison and Mify was revived. The reunited \\"golden line-up\\" of Mify (Danilov, Barikhnovsky, Petrov, Stepanov) recorded several of Stepanov's songs at the newly opened studio. This recording, \\"Proschai, chyornaya subbota\\" (), was Tropillo's first serious studio work. On March 7, 1981, Mify performed at the opening ceremony of the Leningrad Rock Club, alongside Rossianye and Picnic. In the same year, they performed at a festival in the Nevsky Palace of Culture and completed the recording of their debut album Doroga domoi () on AnTrop. In 1983, Mify and Aquarium tied for second place at the first Leningrad rock festival, with Manufaktura taking first place. Mify also received a prize for the anti-war song \\"Otvetny udar\\" (). The group continued to perform, with changed line-ups and occasional hiatuses, over the next few decades. As of 2019, Mify were still active.

BitFunnel uses bit-sliced signatures instead of an inverted index in an attempt to reduce operations cost.  History  Progress on the implementation of BitFunnel was made public in early 2016, with the expectation that there would be a usable implementation later that year. In September 2016, the source code was made available via GitHub. A paper discussing the BitFunnel algorithm and implementation was released as through the Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2017 and won the Best Paper Award.  Components  BitFunnel consists of three major components: * BitFunnel – the text search/retrieval system itself * WorkBench – a tool for preparing text for use in BitFunnel * NativeJIT – a software component that takes expressions that use C data structures and transforms them into highly optimized assembly code  Algorithm = Initial problem and solution overview  The BitFunnel paper describes the \\"matching problem\\", which occurs when an algorithm must identify documents through the usage of keywords. The goal of the problem is to identify a set of matches given a corpus to search and a query of keyword terms to match against. This problem is commonly solved through inverted indexes, where each searchable item is maintained with a map of keywords. In contrast, BitFunnel represents each searchable item through a signature. A signature is a sequence of bits which describe a Bloom filter of the searchable terms in a given searchable item. The bloom filter is constructed through hashing through several bit positions.  Theoretical implementation of Bit-String Signatures  The signature of a document (D) can be described as the logical-or of its term signatures: \\\\overrightarrow{S_D}=\\\\bigcup \\\\limits_{t \\\\in D} \\\\overrightarrow{S_t} Similarly, a query for a document (Q) can be defined as a union: \\\\overrightarrow{S_Q}=\\\\bigcup \\\\limits_{t \\\\in Q} \\\\overrightarrow{S_t} Additionally, a document D is a member of the set M' when the following condition is satisfied: \\\\overrightarrow{S_Q} \\\\cap \\\\overrightarrow{S_D} = \\\\overrightarrow{S_Q} This knowledge is then combined to produce a formula where M' is identified by documents which match the query signature: M'={ D \\\\in C  \\\\overrightarrow{S_Q} \\\\cap \\\\overrightarrow{S_D} = \\\\overrightarrow{S_Q}} These steps and their proofs are discussed in the 2017 paper.

It contains 23 tropical and subtropical species that mostly grow on bark. Neoprotoparmelia is in the subfamily Protoparmelioideae of the family Parmeliaceae, along with the morphologically similar genera Protoparmelia and Maronina. Taxonomy Neoprotoparmelia was circumscribed in 2018 by lichenologists Garima Singh, H. Thorsten Lumbsch, and Imke Schmitt. Its species were formerly placed in Maronina, a genus with a somewhat controversial taxonomic status prior to the advent of modern molecular phylogenetics. Maronina was created in 1990 to contain two species with multispored asci: M. multifera, and the type species, Maronina australiensis. Based on a similarity of ascus characters in Maronina and Protoparmelia, the authors suggested a close relationship between the two, considering Maronina a multispored derivative of Protoparmelia. Later, molecular data confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship between Maronina with Protoparmelia and the former was subsumed into the latter. In 2017, Kraichak and colleagues proposed the use of a temporal banding approach for a consistent classification of taxa at higher taxonomic levels (at family and genus level) for lichen-forming fungi. This approach identifies a divergence time of about 102–112 Ma for families and 29–33 Ma for genera. Because the divergence between Maronina and Protoparmelia is estimated to have occurred about 70 Ma, the genus Maronina was resurrected for use. Molecular analysis revealed that the type species of Maronina, M. australiensis, is sister to a clade containing Protoparmelia and Maronina, demonstrating the circumscription of Maronina to be polyphyletic. To resolve this, Singh and colleagues proposed restricting Maronina to two Australian species (M. australiensis and M. hesperia), and created Neoprotoparmelia to contain the former Maronina species. These species had been previously recognized as an independent lineage, and termed the \\"tropical Protoparmelia clade\\" in a prior phylogenetic analysis. Neoprotoparmelia originally contained 14 species – eight newly described and six new combinations, including the type species, N. corallifera. Two new combinations and six new species (mostly from Brazil) were added to the genus in 2019. Neoprotoparmelia, Protoparmelia, and Maronina are all part of the subfamily Protoparmelioideae in the family Parmeliaceae. The genus name combines the Greek νέος (néos, meaning \\"new\\") with Protoparmelia, alluding to its close relationship with that genus. Description Neoprotoparmelia has a crustose thallus. Its apothecia are lecanorine, and are broadly adnate to sessile, with a distinct thalline margin. The proper margin (referring to an apothecial margin lacking algae and derived from apothecial tissue) is cup-shaped (cupulate), and translucent (hyaline). The asci are eight-spored to multispored, club-shaped (clavate), and variations of the Lecanora-type. The paraphyses are sparingly branched and anastomosing with tips that are clavate and brown-pigmented. Ascospores range in shape from ellipsoid to fusiform (spindle-shaped) to elongated, and are not surrounded by a transparent coat (non-halonate). Pycnidia are immersed and spherical. The conidia have a bacilliform shape. Neoprotoparmelia species mainly produce depsidones of the alectoronic acid chemosyndrome, including dehydroalectoronic acid and β-alectoronic acid . Neoprotoparmelia is morphologically similar to Maronina but can be distinguished by containing depsidones instead of depsides as found in Maronina; additionally Maronina has branched paraphyses. Neoprotoparmelia is also morphologically similar to Protoparmelia. Habitat and distribution Neoprotoparmelia lichens occur in open habitats. Mostly species grow on bark, although a few species are saxicolous on siliceous rock. The genus has a pantropical distribution and has been recorded from Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Thailand, and south-eastern USA.

He has been named by the High Court of Ireland as a senior figure in organised crime on a global scale. The Criminal Assets Bureau has stated he \\"controlled and managed\\" the operations of the Kinahan Organised Crime Group (commonly referred to by the media as the Kinahan Cartel), a criminal organisation which smuggles drugs and firearms into Ireland, the UK and mainland Europe and \\"has associations that facilitate international criminal activity in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America\\". The Kinahan Cartel is party to the Hutch–Kinahan feud, which has resulted in 20 murders, most of which have taken place on the streets of Dublin. Kinahan was reported to have fled his \\"safe-haven\\" of Dubai on 9 July 2020 as a result of the EncroChat probes. Early life Kinahan was born in 1977. He is the eldest son of Christy Kinahan, a convicted drug dealer widely reported to be the founder and leader of the Kinahan Cartel. In 2001, Kinahan was one of five people arrested in connection with a \\"vicious attack\\" on two members of the Garda Síochána outside Shelbourne Park greyhound stadium in May of that year. He was charged with assault and refused bail by Dublin District Court in July 2001. In January 2002, the charges were dropped.  Kinahan Cartel  In a 2009 diplomatic cable sent from a US embassy in South America to The Pentagon, Kinahan was described as a \\"suspected international drug-trafficking figure\\". Kinahan was arrested in Spain in 2010, during a joint SpanishIrishBritish operation, in which SOCA, the predecessor to the UK's National Crime Agency, deployed more than 200 officers in the arrest phase of the multinational drug trafficking inquiry. Kinahan was the reported target of the 2016 Regency Hotel Shooting in which three people were shot, including Kinahan associate David Byrne (32), who was shot dead. It was reported that the Garda Síochána believed Kinahan fled the attack by jumping out a window. He has also been the target of at least one more assassination attempt. In 2018, a Spanish police officer told a court in Marbella that Kinahan had ordered the murder of gang rival Gary Hutch on the Costa del Sol in 2015. As of 2019, Kinahan lives in Dubai with brother Christopher Kinahan Jr. He is banned from entering the US, having been placed on a list of \\"narco terrorists\\", compiled by the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration. There are 27 other associates of the Kinahan Cartel who are also banned from entering the US. His father, Christy Kinahan, and brother Christopher Jr, are also barred from entering the US. Kinahan is reported to be a target for the UK's National Crime Agency. DEA documents sent to the Dutch police exposed what would be a super drug cartel headed by Daniel Kinahan, Raffaele Imperiale (Camorra's drugs and arms dealer), Ridouan Taghi (former Dutch most wanted criminal, now in jail) and Edin G. (Bosnian drug trafficker). The group was observed by the DEA having meetings in the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, where is the base of the alleged cartel. The meetings took place in 2017, however, it only reached the Dutch media in October 2019. The DEA regards this as one of the world's fifty largest drug cartels, with a virtually monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine and would control around a third of the cocaine trade in Europe. Yet, according to the DEA documents, the destination for all the drugs shipments would be the Dutch ports. Boxing promotion controversy In 2012 Kinahan founded MTK Global (originally named MGM) with Irish boxer Matthew Macklin in Marbella, Spain. Since its founding, MTK Global has signed a host of world-class fighters, such as Tyson Fury. In 2017, in the wake of the shooting of David Byrne of which Kinahan was considered the main target, MTK Global cut its ties with Kinahan. However, he has remained a prominent figure in the international boxing world, including as an advisor and matchmaker for Fury. Despite cutting ties with MTK Global in February 2017, Kinahan remained an active figure in global boxing. On 10 June 2020, it was reported that Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua had reached an agreement in principle for a two-fight deal, which pundits touted as the \\"biggest fight in British boxing history\\". Fury publicly thanked Kinahan for helping to broker the agreement. \\"Big shout-out Dan, he got this done, literally over the line, two-fight deal, Tyson Fury versus Anthony Joshua next year.\\" He said. \\"One problem, I’ve just got to smash Deontay Wilder’s face right in in the next fight and then we’re going to the Joshua fight next year.\\" In June 2020, the Irish government expressed its \\"outrage\\" over the involvement of Kinahan in the brokering of the proposed boxing agreement, leading to Kinahan being named in the Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, and being singled out by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the country's prime minister.Government express ‘outrage’ to UK sports minister over Kinahan boxing involvement Irish Times, 2020-06-11 The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs contacted authorities in the United Arab Emirates regarding Kinahan. BBC News reported that \\"politicians, police officers and the public in Ireland are keen that the outside world get to know what they call the real Daniel Kinahan.\\" Also in June 2020, Kinahan, who served as a \\"special adviser\\" to KHK Sports was dropped from the role after just a month. KHK Sports, owned by Khalid bin Hamad Al Khalifa, a son of the king of Bahrain, enlisted the assistance of the head of international media relations for the Bahrain government, in communicating the statement of Kinahan's termination in the role to media outlets directly. Later in June 2020 Tyson Fury ended his relationship with Daniel Kinahan according to Bob Arum.

After the death of the governor-general João de Castro, Sardinha returned to Portugal, studying Canon Law in Coimbra. In 1551, Pope Innocent XI established the Diocese of Brazil, under the Papal bull Super specula militantis ecclesiae. Sardinha was elected to act as its first bishop. He arrived in the city of Salvador in Bahia on February 25, 1551, at the age of 55. Sardinha was ordained a bishop by Dom Fernando de Menezes Coutinho e Vasconcellos, taking office on June 22, 1552. He resigned on June 2, 1556. On July 16 1556, he and his crew were shipwrecked and captured by the Caeté people in the Captaincy of Pernambuco, a Portuguese administrative district that covered the region north of Bahia. The shipwreck occurred in the present-day city of Coruripe in the state of Alagoas at the mouth of the Coruripe River. Sardinha indicated by nods that he was a great prelate of the Portuguese and a priest consecrated to God. He was slaughtered with a mace and devoured, along with his companions.

He interrupted his studies at Harvard University to serve in the United States Army Air Forces during World War Two. After graduation he studied for a doctorate at the London School of Economics and afterwards carried out field work with the university and McGill University in Mauritius and the Seychelles. He joined the University of California, Berkeley, in 1968 and spent the rest of his career there, rising to dean of social sciences. He was made director of the university's Lowie Museum of Anthropology and was responsible for securing additional funding from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. He was director when the museum was renamed after one of its founders Phoebe Apperson Hearst. After retirement in 1994 he continued to volunteer at the museum and at the Oakland Zoo.  Early life  Burton Benedict was born in Baltimore, Maryland on May 20, 1923. He was the son of a Hollywood producer and publicist. As a child Benedict had an interest in ornithology, read Shakespeare and watched many British films. He enrolled at Harvard University to study ornithology but interrupted his studies to join the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Benedict was deployed to New Mexico, where he interacted with the Pueblo Indians, sparking an interest in anthropology. After the war he returned to Harvard and switched his focus to anthropology. Among his classmates were Gregory Bateson and Florence Rockwood (Kluckhohn). Benedict graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology 1949. African field work After graduation Benedict, who described himself as a \\"terrific anglophile\\", went to the United Kingdom to study for a doctor of philosophy degree at the London School of Economics (LSE). While there he worked with Edmund Leach, Maurice Freedman and Raymond Firth. Benedict's thesis was a study of Muslim and Buddhist associations in London but he also carried out field work with the Indian community in Mauritius from 1955 to 1957, funded by the Colonial Social Science Research Council. He spent a year as a senior research fellow at the Institute of Islamic Studies of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, before returning to the LSE in 1958 as an assistant lecturer in social anthropology. Benedict visited the Seychelles in 1960 to carry out field work. He wrote the books Indians in a Plural Society (published 1961); Mauritius: the Problems of a Plural Society (1965) and People of the Seychelles (1966).  Berkeley  Benedict was promoted to lecturer and then senior lecturer before leaving the LSE in 1968 to return to the United States as professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. He had worked at Berkeley as a visiting professor from 1966 to 1967. Benedict initially worked in the university's South Asian studies programme but later collaborated with William Shack and Elizabeth Colson on Berkeley's nascent British social anthropology programme. Benedict served as chair of the Department of Anthropology from 1970 to 1971 when he was appointed Berkeley's first dean of social sciences. He held the position until 1974 and during this time established the Sherwood L. Washburn laboratories for the teaching of physical anthropology. Benedict had a seat on Berkeley's budget committee from 1978 to 1981 and, during his last year, served as chair. In 1982 he co-authored Men, Women and Money in Seychelles: Two Views with his wife Marion, whom he had married in 1950. The Berkeley News described the work as \\"groundbreaking\\" in the field of ethnography and called it a must read for anthropology students. Also in 1982 he put on an exhibition at the university's Lowie Museum of Anthropology about the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, which he described as \\"the last naïve view of a brighter and better world\\". The exhibition was one of the most successful in the museum's history and he afterwards wrote The Anthropology of World’s Fairs: San Francisco’s Panama Pacific International Exposition of 1915 (1983) which described the fair and also contained a study of all world's fairs from the 1851 Great Exhibition to the Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. In 1984 he wrote, produced and narrated The 1915 Panama Pacific Fair which won that year's Western Heritage Award for best television documentary.  Hearst museum  Benedict was appointed associate director of the museum in 1984, acting director in 1988 and director in 1989. In this role he transformed the museum, which had previously suffered from underfunding, by securing additional capital from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. Benedict was also director when the museum was renamed the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology after Phoebe Apperson Hearst, William Randolph Hearst's mother and a 1901 founder of the museum. In 1991 he put on an exhibition about money and in the same year was awarded the Berkeley Citation, the campus' highest award. Benedict retired from the university in 1994 but continued to be involved with the museum as a volunteer museum docent. He was also a trustee of Oakland Zoo where, in 2000, he put on an exhibition on early hominids. In 2004 he taught a course on museum anthropology for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes. Benedict also maintained a collection of Indian and African figurines, Native American and World's Fair artifacts.  Personal life  Burton Benedict married Marion MacColl Steuber. They had two daughters, Helen and Barbara who are both also university professors and authors. He died of heart failure at his home in Berkeley on September 19, 2010.

The sign in the foreground reads: . (in English: \\"Only another Pete and freedom of speech\\".) Kick Out Zwarte Piet (KOZP) is a Dutch activist organization that campaigns against the character (, in English: Black Pete, or Black Peter) in the culture of the Low Countries. Zwarte Piet is traditionally part of the annual Christian feast of (in English: \\"St. Nicholas' Eve\\") in the Netherlands, Belgium, Aruba, Curaçao and the Dutch diaspora on the evening of 5 December in the Netherlands and 6 December in Belgium. Saint Nicholas Day is also celebrated in the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Europe and the Middle East. In the folklore of the Low Countries, Zwarte Piet is portrayed as the dark-skinned Spanish Moor companion to Sinterklaas. Zwarte Piet is a controversial part of Dutch culture in part due to the perceived likeness to the now-disgraced blackface tradition in the United States. Because of this, efforts are made by KOZP and some members of the Dutch public in the form of meetings and protests to abolish Zwarte Piet from Sinterklaasavond, often met by opposition from traditionalists who generally argue that Zwarte Piet represents Dutch tradition and not racism.  Objective  Kick Out Zwarte Piet argue that Zwarte Piet glorifies the history of Dutch colonialism and slavery. The action group advocates a Sinterklaas event featuring only (in English: \\"Sooty Petes\\") or other solutions where possible references to racial characteristics do not play a role. According to KOZP, roles played by Roetpiet would support the celebration of Sinterklaas and no longer refer to a discriminating stereotypical appearance or behavior of dark-skinned people.  History  KOZP was founded in 2014 via the campaign \\"\\" (an initiative of the foundation), \\"Stop Blackface\\" and \\"\\". Zwarte Piet is Racisme was a 2012 art project by poet, artist and activist Quinsy Gario and poet and activist Jerry Afriyie. Gario has not been involved in the campaign since.'Geen mening hebben over zwarte Piet is niet meer mogelijk', OneWorld, 6 December 2019 Afriyie is the foreman of KOZP. He stated that he loved Sinterklaas and the processions as a child. KOZP first appeared just before the arrival of Sinterklaas in Meppel in 2015. Some anti-Zwarte Piet activists stated that KOZP are too soft. They believe that change is too slow and emphasize more and harder actions. On 11 November 2019, KOZP accused police of failing to protect its members' safety after four people were arrested for violently breaking up a meeting. On 20 June 2020, Jerry Afriyie and members of his family were the recipients of a death threat letter signed \\"\\" (in English: Pegida Division North), however Pegida Netherlands (the Dutch branch of the German far-right, anti-Islam movement Pegida) have distanced themselves from the letter. An Amsterdam police spokesperson stated that they are aware of the threat, that they have been in contact with Afriyie and that he has filed a complaint. Amsterdam police have begun investigating who the sender is and stated that they take the matter very seriously.  Threat assessment controversy  According to an article by Robert Toret in the Dutch regional newspaper Leidsch Dagblad, Jerry Afriyie stated at a 2016 KOZP meeting in Leiden that there are several strategies: \\"\\" (in English: \\"One goes singing at the Dam, the other goes to a procession with a bat. I think that they should both be given space.\\") However, this statement was denied by Jerry Afriyie. In 2017, KOZP was listed as an \\"extreme left-wing anti-racist action group\\" under the heading \\"\\" in the \\"\\" (DTN) (in English: Terrorist Threat Assessment Netherlands), which is being prepared by the security services. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism Dick Schoof emphasized that the group had not used violence. Schoof did not rule out the possibility that the movement was potentially extremist and violent. Following a complaint from KOZP, as of 2019 the group would be labeled as an activist organization that strives to achieve its goals within the limits of the law and not as a left-wing extremist or terrorist organization. KOZP was no longer included in later versions of the DTN but the Zwarte Piet discussion is generally mentioned under the heading \\"\\" (in English: polarization), with the blockade on the A7 motorway being mentioned in 2018.

Blue Origin is the lead contractor for the multi-element lunar lander that would include major components from several large US government space contractors including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper Laboratory. The lander concept was initiated in 2019, and in April 2020, Blue Origin won a contract from NASA for a 10-month design concept study to be completed in 2020-2021. NASA expects to subsequently issue build and test contracts to one or two of the three awardees in the April design competition awards in order to advance the human landing element of the Artemis Program. If the program remains on schedule, NASA hopes to land \\"the first woman and the next man\\" on the Moon in 2024. The National Team of Blue Origin/Northrop Grumman/Lockheed-Martin/Draper is just one of three organizations who are developing lunar lander designs for the Artemis program over a 10-month period in 202021 under the NASA HLS funding rubric. If the ILV team completes the milestone-based requirements of the design contract, then NASA will pay the combined contractors in design development funding. The other teams selected are Dynetics—with SNC and other unspecified companies with the Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS)—with in NASA funding, and SpaceX, with its Starship HLS concept, slated to receive in NASA funding. At the end of the ten month program, NASA will evaluate which contractors will be offered contracts for initial demonstration missions and select firms for development and maturation of lunar lander systems.  History  Initial design work for the Integrated Lander Vehicle began in 2019. ILV is being designed by \\"the National Team\\", consisting of Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper. Blue Origin is leading the combined integration effort, and will design the descent element. Northrop Grumman is designing the transfer element, for the initial engine firing to place the ILV on a trajectory out of NRHO (near-rectilinear halo orbit) and toward the lunar surface with an initial descent burn. Lockheed-Martin is designing the ascent element, that will depart the lunar surface and return the astronauts to the NASA space facility and capsule in lunar orbit.  Description  The ILV lander system is composed of three-elements: a transfer element, the descent element, and the ascent element. ILV is proposed to be used for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program. The Integrated Lander Vehicle (ILV)—also known as the \\"National HLS\\"—is being designed for long-duration in-space use, as well as long stays on the lunar surface. The Blue ILV system was proposed to NASA to dock in lunar orbit either with the Lunar Gateway or with the Orion crew vehicle.https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/30/blue-origin-wins-lions-share-of- nasa-funding-for-human-rated-lunar-lander/ If built, the ILV HLS variant would be launched to lunar orbit by one of several different launch vehicles—including, potentially, the Blue Origin New Glenn and the United Launch Alliance Vulcan Centaur—for the lunar transit to join up with the NASA Lunar Gateway and a NASA crew to be shuttled to the lunar surface. In the mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry the NASA crew to the lander where they would depart and descend to the lunar surface in the ILV. After lunar surface operations, the ILV ascent element would ascend and return the crew to the Orion.

Location The pond is about east of Itahari and west of Damak. Google Maps shows Kanepokhari in the forest area to the east of the section of the Kanepokhari–Rangeli Road that runs south from Kanepokhari village to Aitabare village. The pond is north of the Aitabare-Sukrabare Road, which defines the southern boundary of the forest area. In the past the pond was home to rare fishes, turtles and snakes, and the waters were used by migratory birds and forest deer. Name There are different stories about the origins of the pond's name. One is that an old woman who lived near the pond sold ear ornaments to the Dhimal people to wear during festivals, and the name comes from Kane Gahana, meaning \\"ear ornaments\\". Another is that people used to eat near the pond during festivals, and the name comes from Khajapokhari (food pond), which evolved into Kanepokhari. A third story is that in the Mahabharata period King Virata ordered a cattle herder named Kane to dig the pond to provide water to his cows, and the pond is named after the herder. Shrinkage In 2012 it was reported that lakes in Eastern Nepal were drying up, and some could disappear completely, due to a combination of climate change, deforestation, human activities and encroachment. Kane Pokhari was among the ponds that had been saved from the brink of disappearance due to local initiatives. In May 2019 it was reported that the lake had shrunk from five Bighas in area to just one Bigha. The local government allocated Rs. 1 million in 2018 to conserve the pond, but due to lack of an action plan the money was unspent. The President Chure Conservation Committee had allocated Rs. 1.5 million to conserve the pond, but internal problems in the committee meant that money was also unspent.

Of apparent remarkable keenness of perception, Rabbi Ephraim refused to recognize, either in the theoretical or in the practical field, any post-Talmudic authority, and often, therefore, came into conflict with his teachers and colleagues. Once, after a particularly heated dispute with the rabbis of Speyer, Rabbenu Tam answered Rabbi Ephraim sharply stating: \\"From the day I have known you, I have never heard you concede a point\\"Sefer ha-Yashar, no. 64. Rabbenu Tam, however, appreciating Ephraim's selfless motives, bore him no ill will, even referring to him affectionately as \\"my brother Rabbi Ephraim\\"Sefer ha-Yashar, no. 80. Another time, Rabbi Ephraim tried to introduce extensive modifications to the strict Passover regulations, in spite of the protest of Rabbi Ephraim ben Joseph, who's authority he refused to recognize. However Rabbi Ephraim is probably best known for abrogating established customs and religious regulations which had been long regarded as inviolable, because he saw no reason for their existence to be found in the Talmud. Despite his controversial nature, his halakic literature was still greatly respected and still achieved great success. He is considered by some as the greatest writer of piyyutim of his time. Over thirty two of his piyyutim are extant, many of which reflect the hardships suffered by the Jews of Germany in the Regensburg massacre of 1137 and during the Second Crusade. He later moved on to Worms, and then back to Regensburg, where he died in 1175.  Works  Ephraim wrote tosafot to various Talmudic treatises, some portions of which may be found in the printed tosafot as well as in other works. He wrote a commentary on Pirkei Avot and halakhic decisioning. He also apparently wrote \\"Arba Panim\\" a commentary on Seder Nezikin. Ephraim also employed the metric forms of Sephardi poetry and one of his seliḥot is in the Sephardi festival liturgy.

Eduard von Pestel (18 May 1821, Münster – 24 March 1908 Wiesbaden) was a Prussian generalleutnant. He is best known for his defense of Saarbrücken and Sankt Johann before and during the Battle of Saarbrücken on 2 August 1870, the first major engagement of the Franco-Prussian War. Regarded as a war hero by the local population, he was made an honorary citizen of Saarbrücken and Sankt Johann. Biography=Ancestry Pestel was born at Münster on 18 May 1821, a grandson of the Prussian Chamber Councillor Christoph Heinrich von Pestel (1736–1794), whose appointment as director of the County of Mark′s War and Domain Chamber in 1787 elevated the family to the status of nobility. Eduard von Pestel′s father was the government councilor Georg von Pestel (1783–1846), and his mother was Sabine Melusine Wilhelmine Magdalene Christiane, born Countess of Hardenberg (1781–1850). Military career After joining the Prussian Army as an officer candidate, Pestel first passed the Portepee Ensign examination. He joined the 11th Hussar Regiment as an ensign in 1838. In 1849 he participed in the Second Schleswig War. He was promoted to rittmeister in 1856. In 1866 he took part in the Austro-Prussian War and became a staff officer in the 7th Westphalian Dragoon Regiment. In 1869 he took command of the 7th Uhlan Regiment. The 7th Uhlan Regiment was stationed in Saarbrücken at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War on 19 July 1870. A week later, on 26 July 1870, Pestel was promoted from major to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel). In overall command of a combined force only 900 men of his regiment and the 40th Regiment of the Prussian 16th Division and without artillery support, he succeeded with the active participation of the city population in presenting the appearance of a secure defensive position that discouraged his 20,000-strong French opponent from attempting to take Saarbrücken for 14 days. After the French did take the city on 2 August 1870, they quickly retreated, sparing the civilian population from pillage. Pestel gained local fame for his defense of Saarbrücken and was given the popular title \\"Hero of Saarbrücken\\". As a thank you, he was made an honorary citizen of Saarbrücken in 1896. On 6 September 1870, Pestel and his 7th Uhlan Regiment redeployed to Metz to take part in the ongoing Siege of Metz.

Pellegrino Tibaldi, Dance of the Genii, 1554-1556, Palazzo Poggi, Bologna The Palazzo Sampieri frescoes are a set of paintings by Annibale, Agostino and Ludovico Carracci in the Palazzo Sampieri in Bologna. They form the last surviving collection of works by the three artists.  History  The scheme was commissioned by Astorre Sampieri, young abbot of Santa Lucia di Roffeno, member of a powerful family which had been promoted to senatorial rank in 1590Eugenio Riccomini, L'Ercole trionfante. I tre Carracci a Casa Sampieri, Bologna, 2006, pp. 9-38.. He had arrived back in the city shortly before commissioning the work from the three artists, already noted for their Life of Aeneas and Lives of Jason and Medea frescoes at the Palazzo Fava and their Scenes from the Foundation of Rome frescoes at the Palazzo Magnani, both in Bologna. Those schemes were all friezes, but at the Palazzo Sampieri they planned three large ceiling scenes and three large scenes over fireplaces in each room. The reasons for this choice are unknown - Astore Sampieri may have wanted something different from the norm or the low rooms may simply not have lent themselves to friezes. None of the three artists had previous experience of the \\"sottinsù\\" (upside-down) technique the scheme would require, but Annibale and Agostino had frequently seen and admired examples of it in palazzi and churches in Venice by artists such as Veronese and Tintoretto, artists personally known to Agostino. They also drew heavily on Pellegrino Tibaldi's mid 16th-century frescoes at Palazzo Poggi in Bologna, rare if not unique examples of \\"sottinsù\\"Anton W. A. Boschloo, Annibale Carracci in Bologna: visible reality in art after the Council of Trent, L'Aia, 1974, pp. 63-64., with his Dance of the Genii in a small room next to his better known Life of Ulysses cycle proving the Carraci's main reference point. The Palazzo Sampieri frescoes are framed by ornate stucco cornices by the sculptor Gabriele Fiorini, a faithful collaborator who had already worked with the Carracci on other projects, particularly at the Palazzo Magnani. As well as the frescoes, the three painters produced three large over-door canvases, all showing Christ meeting women in the Gospels and all now in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan - Christ and the Samaritan Woman by Annibale, Christ and the Canaanite Woman by Ludovico and Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery by AgostinoDonald Posner, Annibale Carracci: A Study in the reform of Italian Painting around 1590, London, 1971, Vol. II, nn. 77, 78 e 79, p. 33..

In an early 20th century study the art historian Hans Tietze placed the completion of the whole decorative scheme to 1593-1594, just before the print, a conclusion backed in almost all later studies. This makes it the last surviving ceiling scheme on which the three artists collaborated, with Annibale moving to Rome just afterwards and staying there until his death, Agostino joining him just afterwards before moving to Parma, where he died, and Ludovico staying in Bologna and becoming head of its artistic milieu.

Preparatory drawings Additions by Guercino  Guercino, Hercules and Antaeus In 1631 Guercino was summoned to the Palazzo Sampieri to paint the ceilings of its last two rooms with more scenes from the life of Hercules, continuing the Carracci brothers' iconographic scheme with scenes of Hercules fighting Antaeus and Hercules strangling serpents as a baby. The latter scene was destroyed in 1876 during a failed attempt to remove it from the ceiling. Like the Carracci scenes, the works were accompanied by Latin summaries, SIC PEREAT QUISQUIS TERRA GENITRICE SUPERBIT for the Antaeus scene and ITER AD SUPEROS GLORIA PANDET for the lost baby scene.

The lower part of this small valley is served by Chemin Royale (route 368) which bypasses all of Île d'Orléans. Agriculture is the main economic activity in this small valley. The surface of the Moulin stream is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March, except for the rapids areas in the lower part; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  The Moulin stream rises at the limit of the forest and agricultural area, more or less in the center of the island, in Sainte-Famille-de-l'Île-d'Orléans. This source is located northwest of a curve of the Dauphine River, southeast of the chenal de l'Île d'Orléans and northeast of the shore of the St. Lawrence River (Chenal des Grands Voiliers). From this source, the course of the Moulin stream descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments: * north-east first in the forest zone, then entering the agricultural zone, crossing rapids on , up to route 368; * towards the northeast by forming some streamers at the start of the segment, with a drop of , crossing rapids, to its mouth Atlas of Canada - Department of Natural Resources Canada - Ruisseau du Moulin - Distance and altitude measurements taken from application of site measures. . The Moulin stream flows to the bottom of Anse aux Canards, near the Pointe de la Croix. This mouth is located on the south shore of the chenal de l'Île d'Orléans (which is connected to the St. Lawrence River) in Saint-François-de-l'Île-d'Orléans. At this location, the chenal de l'Île d'Orléans is wide.  Toponymy  Formerly, this watercourse was designated \\"Argentenay river\\". The point located at the extreme north of the island is designated Pointe Argentenay; it is surrounded by sandstone at low tide. The toponym \\"ruisseau du Moulin\\" refers to a modest mill erected in the 18th century along its course, probably near the mouth. According to the popular usage of the inhabitants of the island, this river is considered a river and not a stream. Three rivers of this island are designated according to the existence of a mill built on their respective course. The toponym \\"brook of the Moulin\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Bank of Place Names of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: Ruisseau du Moulin - Accessed June 12, 2020  See also  * Capitale-Nationale, an administrative region * L'Île-d'Orléans Regional County Municipality (MRC) * Île d'Orléans, an island * Sainte-Famille-de-l'Île-d'Orléans * Saint-François- de-l'Île-d'Orléans * Chenal de l'Île d'Orléans * St. Lawrence River * List of rivers of Quebec  Notes and references  Category:Rivers of Capitale- Nationale Category:L'Île-d'Orléans Regional County Municipality ","title":"Ruisseau du Moulin (île d'Orléans)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your library🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(B,[["render",I]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/12.md","filePath":"quotes/12.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/12.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{x as __pageData,F as default};
