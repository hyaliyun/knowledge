The role of handling complaints against federal authorities has to some extent been unofficially incorporated into the role of the US Member of Congress. This informal job has become increasingly time consuming. It is subject to criticism on the grounds that it interferes with a legislator's primary duty, namely to read and be knowledgeable about a bill before casting his or her vote.Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report 35 (3 September 1977): 1855. Federal Departments and agencies Several ombudsman services have been created as complaint-handling units housed within, but operationally independent from, specific federal authorities. Internal Revenue Service In 1979 the Taxpayer Ombudsman Office was created within the Internal Revenue Service to act as an ombudsman for the taxpayer.Taxation - Report of the National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, American Bar Association, February 27, 2008 Renamed in 1996 as the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, this office has a unique role with the Treasury Department as having the responsibility to submit annual reports to Congress without any prior review or comment from the IRS Commissioner, the Secretary of the Treasury, any other officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury, or the Office of Management and Budget., §101(a) Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman) provides recommendations for resolving individual and employer problems with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS Ombudsman) As mandated by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 § 452, the CIS Ombudsman is not a part of USCIS, but an independent DHS office which reports directly to the DHS Deputy Secretary. The Ombudsman assists individuals and employers in resolving problems with USCIS; identifies areas in which individuals and employers have problems in dealing with USCIS; and proposes changes to mitigate identified problems. The Ombudsman submits an annual report to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, focusing on systemic issues that cause delay in granting immigration benefits as well as pervasive and serious problems faced by individuals and employers in their interactions with USCIS. The First Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (2003–08) was Prakash Khatri. During his tenure, he delivered four annual reports to Congress which included over 70 recommendations for improvements to USCIS. Department of Education The Department of Education has an Office of the Ombudsman, which works with federal student loan borrowers to resolve loan disputes or problems from an impartial, independent viewpoint.https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay- loans/disputes/prepare/contact-ombudsman Environmental Protection Agency The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has an ombudsman to facilitate communication between small business owners and the agency. Food and Drug Administration The Food and Drug Administration Ombudsman seeks to ensure that the agency fulfils its regulatory responsibilities well.Food and Drug Administration Ombudsman In the short term, the Office is dedicated to facilitating problem resolution. In the long term, the Office looks at issues systematically in order to make the process work better. Thus it welcomes more general complaints, comments, and suggestions about FDA's regulatory processes. United States Navy The US Navy implemented an ombudsman program in 1970, under the direction of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. Through the Navy Ombudsman Program, communication between the spouses of active duty personnel and the command is kept open, thereby improving the quality of life for everyone involved. The Navy command ombudsman is a voluntary position, and seeks to ensure that the dependents of active duty personnel have a channel of resources for their needs and quality of life. A command ombudsman aims to guide those who use the service to the help they may need, before, during or after a deployment. The Navy Ombudsman undergoes almost constant training, and is bound by confidentiality except in relation to allegations of child abuse. An ombudsman meets with department heads aboard a naval installation to find out the latest news, and pass it on, including news on ship deployments, cutting down on potentially harmful gossip. State-level ombudsmen Since 1967 at least five state legislatures and one territorial legislature have established and continued to employ a full-time ombudsman. These states are Hawaii, Nebraska, Alaska, Iowa and Arizona, and the U.S. territory is Puerto Rico. Many other states have ombudsmen appointed by, and located within the office of the governor. The job description for state offices of ombudsmen invariably involves the trouble-shooting function of investigating citizen complaints concerning specific acts by government agencies. For example, in Nebraska (https://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/divisions/ombud.php) the ombudsman's duties are as follows: > To receive complaints from the public and from persons working in > government; to investigate; and where appropriate to negotiate remedial > action with the agencies involved. A secondary duty is to answer questions > and assist people with problems relating to government.Kent M. Weeks, > Ombudsmen Around the World: A Comparative Chart, 2d. ed. (Berkeley: > University of California, Institute of Governmental Studies, 1978), p. 162. Other state ombudsmen include: * Ombudsman.hawaii.gov - State of Hawaii Office of the Ombudsman: independently and impartially investigates complaints against state and county agencies and employees * http://www.legis.state.ia.us/Ombudsman/ - Office of Citizens' Aide Ombudsman, Iowa * azleg.state.az.us/ombudsman/ - Arizona's Ombudsman Citizen's Aide * - State of Alaska Ombudsman State Long Term Care Ombudsmen Several states have a long term care ombudsman whose duties include assistance to residents of nursing homes, including New York State , and supplemental programs developed to protect long term care residents' rights. State children's ombudsmen Most states have a children's advocate or ombudsman service: see main children's ombudsman article. Other specialist state ombudsmen Other states have ombudsmen specific to particular issues, including: * State of Minnesota Office of the Ombudsman for Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities * The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management employs an ombudsman \\"charged with authority to undertake independent, and in certain cases confidential, fact-finding in response to external or internal complaints or questions about the Department's performance.\\" The office is currently held by Thomas Getz.RI DEM/Office of the Ombudsman Home Page * Washington State Office of Education Ombuds * Michigan has an Office of Employer Ombudsman to aid in employer-related Unemployment Insurance Agency questions.http://www.michigan.gov/uia/0,1607,7-118-6006-11782--,00.html * Utah created the Office of the Property Rights Ombudsman in 1996. This office advises citizens on property rights, and helps resolve disputes arising between property owners and government agencies acquiring property. The Office is authorized to mediate between property owners and government agencies, arbitrate disputes, and issue advisory opinions on land use and development issues. * Most states, including Puerto Rico, have an Ombudsman associated with its State Department of Aging (or similar). Within these states are AAAs (Area Agencies on Aging), most often headed by a paid manager of a volunteer network of ombudsmen assigned to such facilities as skilled nursing homes, personal care homes, centers for the aging (outpatient), and the like. These ombudsmen are trained and taught that they \\"work for the aged\\", not the personnel managing the facilities. They act as advocates for the residents or attendees when complaints or disputes arise between the aging and the management. If no resolution can be worked-out locally, the matter in dispute is carried higher, first to district officials and, if necessary, to the state, often involving the state licensing agency that oversees the facility in question. In the case of Puerto Rico, while the main Ombudsman's office, created in 1977 in a statute signed by Gov. Carlos Romero Barceló is under the Legislative Branch's jurisdiction, four specialized ombudsmen offices (Aging, Veterans, Health and Disabilities) fall under the Executive Branch's Office of Ombudsmen Offices. City and county ombudsmen=King County, Washington The King County Ombudsman's Office was created by the voters of King County, Washington, in the Home Rule Charter of 1968, and operates as an independent office within the legislative branch of King County government. King County is the most populous county in Washington and includes Seattle, the state's most populous city. The Office investigates complaints regarding the administrative conduct of King County agencies, and alleged violations of county codes dealing with employee ethics, whistleblower protection, and lobbyist disclosure. The King County Ombudsman is appointed to a renewable five-year term by the King County Council and is removable mid-term only for cause.King County Ombudsman, Washington State Seattle The City of Seattle plans to have an Office of Employee Ombuds established in January 2019. Compared to the county ombudsman, the city ombudsman will play less of an investigative role and more of advocative role. Los Angeles The Los Angeles County Department of Ombudsman was created via the approval of an ordinance in 1993 by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. This department was the first of its kind in the state of California and the first nationally involved in law enforcement oversight.Los Angeles Department of Ombudsman New York City The New York City Public Advocate is the ombudsman for residents of New York City. It investigates and responds to telephone and written complaints/queries regarding city agency services, providing information and referrals. Detroit The City of Detroit Office of the Ombudsman works as an independent oversight agency to provide individuals with a confidential avenue to address complaints. News ombudsmen and Public Editors *National Public Radio - In October 2007, journalist, author, media critic and educator Alicia C. Shepard began a three-year appointment as Ombudsman for NPR. *Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) also has an ombudsman.

It is an edible mushroom found in European pine forests. The mushroom has a reddish to chestnut-brown cap that reaches up to in diameter, and a yellow stem measuring up to tall by thick. On the underside of the cap are small angular pores, initially bright yellow before turning greenish-brown with age. A characteristic feature that helps to distinguish it from similar Suillus species, such as S. granulatus, is the pinkish mycelia at the base of the stem. Molecular analysis has shown the species to be related to other typical Mediterranean Suillus species such as S. bellinii, S. luteus, and S. mediterraneensis. S. collinitus is a mycorrhizal species, and forms associations with several species of pine, most notably the Aleppo pine. This tree species is commonly used in reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region, and S. collinitus is often used as a beneficial inoculant to help the young trees better survive in typically harsh soil conditions. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming The species was first described as Boletus collinitus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. Otto Kuntze transferred it to the genus Suillus in his 1898 Revisio Generum Plantarum. In 1969 Dutch mycologist H.S.C. Huijsman described the variety S. collinitus var. aureus (as S. fluryi var. aureus; S. fluryi is a synonym of S. collinitus) based on a collection from Switzerland. The variety velatipes was described in 1998 by Giampaolo Simonini and colleagues from Italian collections. A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The results indicated that S. collinitus is most closely related to a specimen of S. granuatus collected from Nepal. According to the authors, this Nepalese isolate probably represents a species distinct from North American and European isolates, based on morphology and host tree association. In 2006, a phylogenetic analysis of Suillus isolates collected from Spain showed that S. collinitus was closely related to other species \\"typical of the Mediterranean area\\", namely S. bellinii, S. luteus, and S. mediterraneensis. The specific epithet collinitus is derived from Latin, and means \\"smeared\\" or \\"greased\\". The British botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke called the mushroom the \\"ringless yellow boletus\\" in an 1873 publication. Description View of flesh and pore structure The fruit body of Suillus collinitus is a medium to large, fleshy bolete. The cap is initially rounded, becoming convex and finally flat, reaching up to in diameter. The cap is covered with a brown cuticle of variable shade that is decorated with minuscule radial striations, which become more obvious in fully expanded specimens and especially in dry weather. The cap is often shaped irregularly and becomes viscid (sticky) when damp. The tubes are short and their stem attachment is usually slightly decurrent to adnate. The small and angular pores are yellow but darken with age. Young, fresh specimens sometimes bear droplets of a clear fluid that collect on the pore surface. The cylindrical stem is often short and stubby, typically tall by thick, coloured yellowish and ornamented with sparse reddish-brown granules. There is no ring. The base of the stem bears pink overtones and is attached to distinctively pink mycelial threads, which are visible when the fruit body is uprooted. The flesh is yellowish, thick and soft. In a colour reaction test with ammonia solution, the flesh turns reddish. The spores are seen ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when viewed with a light microscope. They are fusiform (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are four-spored. Especially characteristic for S. collinitus are the cap striations and pink mycelium. The fungus in many aspects resembles S. granulatus – a common species in European pine forests. S. granulatus, however, has a homogenous brown cap without striations, and its mycelium is characteristically white. Varieties Two varieties of S. collinitus have been described. S. collinitus var. aureus has a golden-yellow cap. S. collinitus var. velatipes, originally found in Italy growing in poor acidic soil in association with Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), is distinguished by a glutinous brown veil at the base of the stem, and a slender white felting at the cap margin. Similar species Suillus collinitus is often found in the same habitat with other thermophilic species, including S. mediterraneensis and S. bellinii, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Some common species which occur throughout much of Europe and also associate with two-needled pines include S. luteus and S. granulatus. Edibility Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste. It is advisable, as for all species of Suillus, to pick only young specimens and to peel the cuticle before preparation. The mushroom contains several tocopherols, a class of chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E, and which confer antioxidant activity. They also contain several organic acids, most predominantly the pairs malic and quinic acids, and citric and ketoglutaric acid, which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total organic acids. The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity. Distribution, habitat, and ecology The Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) is one of several species with which S. collinitus forms mycorrhizae. Suillus collinitus is found throughout Europe. It is an ectomycorrhizal fungus, forming mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships with several species of pine (Pinus). These include several two-needled European species of pine: Aleppo pine (P. halepensis) European black pine (P. nigra), stone pine (P. pinea), and Scots pine (P. sylvestris). The fungus favours limestone soils. S. collinitus is thermophilic, commonly occurring in southern Europe. It is rarely seen in more northern regions, such as the British Isles and Poland. It is red-listed in Denmark as near-threatened, and in Estonia as endangered. It has also been collected in Iran. The mushroom was reported in the municipality of Paipa, in the department of Boyaca, in Colombia. It was reported by mycologyst Juan Camilo Rodríguez Martínez. Suillus collinitus is the most frequent fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed in the south of France discovered that S. collinitus and S. mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may play a key role in the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S. collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S. grevillei and S. spraguei, S. collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above- ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations. The ectomycorrizhae formed between several Suillus species and Aleppo pine has been studied under in vitro conditions in the laboratory. Tree shoots inoculated with either S. collinitus, S. bellinii, and S. mediterraneensis tended to grow better and showed superior mycorrhizal development than other tested Suillus species, suggesting that the three have a \\"physiological specificity\\" for the tree. A 2010 publication reported that the fungal hyphae are covered in crystals of oxalic acid, which, in addition to reducing soil pH, reduces grazing by the soil microarthropod Folsomia candida.

It is the seventh episode of the show's seventh season and was broadcast on November 7, 2010. Plot Lynette and Renee start a business in interior design, after a little persuasion from Renee. Renee suggests hiring Susan as Lynette's nanny. Lynette is reluctant, but eventually agrees. She ends up comforting Susan when she feels bad about not being as financially stable as her friends. Mike has left town after taking the job in Alaska, and Susan accepts Lynette's offer to be baby Paige's nanny, even though she originally thought she was being hired to work in Lynette and Renee's new business. The next day, Susan overhears a new client of Lynette and Renee's, and she suggests that she ask her daughter for her favorite characters to paint on her wall. The woman likes Susan's idea. Renee gets mad at Susan for her meddling, while Lynette wonders why her friend is acting strange. Susan eventually reveals that she feels the nanny job is beneath her, and is ashamed to be the poor person in her group of friends. Lynette comforts her, saying that money can't change the way she looks in their eyes. Bree is rollerskating with Keith when she gets hot and dizzy out of nowhere and falls off her skates. She is examined by a medic who tells her that it is a hot flash and she is starting menopause. Bree is horrified. She goes to her OB/GYN, but there is a substitute working as her regular OB/GYN is out on maternity leave. She and the sub hit it off, and Bree reveals that she is in a relationship with a man 17 years her junior, and asks for ways to hide the symptoms. Later, Bree meets Keith's parents for dinner at a local restaurant; Keith's mother just happens to be the substitute OB/GYN. Throughout dinner, Keith's mom drops hints about Bree's visit to her until Bree finally admits to being menopausal. Ashamed, Bree leaves the restaurant. Keith finds her later, and tells her that he doesn't care about her being menopausal or having children with his DNA. They can always adopt. Bree sadly tells him that she does not want to have children again. Keith is upset, but asks Bree to forget the conversation for a while so that they can be happy. Bree agrees. Gaby fears that Bob might be trying to seduce Carlos after they become friends and Lee warns her that Bob has \\"flipped\\" straight men before. Gaby confronts Carlos with her worries when she finds out that he and Bob plan to go away for a weekend and plan to share a hotel room. Carlos thinks she's wrong, but nevertheless agrees. Bob reveals to Gaby later that he is hurt that she thinks he would try to steal Carlos from her. She listens in guilt as he explains that all he does is work and come home to an empty house. He is lonely and wants some time to hang out with guys just for companionship and nothing more. Gaby says that Bob and Carlos can go out, but later revokes the statement as she says that Lee is who Bob should really go with, as they still love each other. Bob and Lee share their first on-screen kiss. Paul and Beth have sex finally, after Beth's initial reluctance. Afterwards, Beth begins to question Paul's motives for returning to Wisteria Lane when she finds out that he is letting his old cellmate move into his old house. He refuses to tell her why. The next day when Paul is out, Beth goes over to his old house and confronts his cellmate. She shows more of her disturbed and personality when she threatens to tell the police that he attempted to rape her if the guy does not comply with her wishes (to tell her what Paul's up to). Later, Beth confronts Paul about what his former cellmate told her (it is not revealed to the viewers at what the guy told Beth). Paul tries to defend himself, but finds there is no need, as Beth tells him as before that she supports her husband in all his endeavors. He calls her the \\"perfect wife\\", but it is proved she is not when it is revealed at the end that Beth's mother, to whom she is always whispering on the phone, is none other than Paul's equally demented and sworn enemy: the imprisoned Felicia Tilman.

It is one of the two orchestras affiliated with the Bavarian Radio (Bayerischer Rundfunk), the other being the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. A precursor ensemble to the Munich Radio Orchestra was established in the 1920s. The current Munich Radio Orchestra was formalised in 1952, with Werner Schmidt-Boelke as its first chief conductor. The orchestra's focus has historically been on light music, with particular emphasis in its early years as an orchestra for operettas. The orchestra was also historically known for its Sunday concerts. From the chief conductorship of Lamberto Gardelli (1982–1985) onwards, the orchestra expanded its repertoire into opera, specifically Italian opera. This work continued under the orchestra's next three chief conductors, all Italians, Giuseppe Patanè (1988–1989), Roberto Abbado (1992–1998), and Marcello Viotti (1998–2005). This activity extended to commercial recordings of operas and opera excerpts with the orchestra's chief conductors. The orchestra faced budget constraints and the threat of dissolution by Bavarian Radio in 2004. In protest at these threats to the existence of the orchestra, Viotti resigned as chief conductor that year. After negotiations, the orchestra was preserved, with a reduction in size from 72 to 50 musicians. From 2006 to 2017, the orchestra's chief conductor was Ulf Schirmer. During his tenure, Schirmer has conducted with the orchestra commercial recordings for the Bavarian Radio's own BR-Klassik label, including Karl Amadeus Hartmann's Des Simplicius Simplicissimus Jugend. The orchestra has also recorded for other labels such as CPO, RCA, Acanta and Sony Classical. In May 2016, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ivan Repušić as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2017–2018 season.

The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis -at least on a qualitative point of view-for the patterns observed on animal skins such as tigers or zebra, tropical fishes, sea shells, minerals such as agate... The software always creates seamless textures. Beyond the classical and well studied reaction–diffusion models such as the Brusselator, the software also contains new reaction–diffusion equations invented by the author, who worked 4 years as a researcher in this field. Applications TexRD was designed at first for graphic designers and cyber artists. Seen also as mathematical game, it allows science lovers to create new and original textures because the number of parameter combinations is nearly infinite. The interest of playing with a texture generator (discovering new patterns) also comes from the fact that many reaction–diffusion patterns cannot be predicted by the theory - except for the simplest models. They require multiple trials associating chance, observations and attempts to find the rules governing the effects of the various parameters. Such textures produced from computer simulations can be used to create abstract images for postal cards, front pages, bindings, paper bookmarks, wallpapers, as well as new ideas for decoration patterns.

A scholar in theology and Lutheranism, conciliarist, and a trained physician, he was an opponent of antitrinitarianism, but his views on Christ's mediatorship were actually used by antitrinitarians to popularize their views in Poland and Hungary. His teachings never achieved widespread credibility amongst Calvinists, but he received a considerable following, particularly amongst the Polish and Hungarian aristocracy, and is considered one of the most successful Reformists in Poland. He was imprisoned on numerous occasions and much of his life was spent as an itinerant theologian, traveling extensively across eastern Europe. From 1551 he was involved in the Osiandrian controversy, an extensive Lutheran debate in Germany and Prussia which extended into the mid 1560s. While acknowledging both natures, human and divine, of Christ, Stancaro claimed that Jesus Christ was a mediator not as God but as a man: this doctrine was challenged by the theologian Andreas Musculus in a public discussion held in Berlin on October 10, 1552. Stancaro authored De Trinitate et Mediatore Domino nostro Iesu Christo adversus Henricum Bullingerum...Ad magnificos et generosos Dominos Nobiles ac eorum Ministeros a variis Pseudoevabelicis seductis a decade later in which he offered his views on the issue, mainly in response to Peter Martyr Vermigli, a strong critic of Stancaro. In 1562 he settled in Stopnica, where he led a comparatively quiet life in retirement. He died on November 12, 1574. Life Stancaro was born in Mantua in 1501. He devoted himself to the humanities and scholarly learning, and was ordained as a priest in Padua. He published De modo legendi Hebraice institutio brevissima in 1530. Brought up a Roman Catholic, he became a Protestant in 1540, while teaching Hebrew at the University of Padua. He left for Venice, where he was arrested and imprisoned for sometime, joining another Protestant Italian, Francesco Negri. He left Venice in 1541, and arrived in Vienna by 1544. He was professor of Greek and Hebrew there, but lost his post in 1546. Bernardino Ochino, companion of Stancaro from March 1546. In March 1546 he reached Regensburg, where he met Bernardino Ochino, with whom he went, via Ratisbon, to Augsburg to teach Greek and Hebrew. With the defeat of the Protestant Schmalkaldic League by the troops of Charles V, in 1547 Stancaro and Ochino fled Augsburg. They spent time in Strasbourg, where Ochino met up with old friend Peter Martyr and they received an invitation by Archbishop Cranmer to visit London. They also visited Constance and Zurich during this period, before finding refuge in Basel. At Basel he found the time to produce four theological works, Suae ebraee grammaticae compendium, nunc primum excussum, In epistolam canonicam D. Jacobi Heriolymitani expositio pia, Miscellanea theologica. Nempe gradus beneficiorum dei, de templis Judaeorum, bibliorum scriptroes, deprophetis, Israeliticus ordo, de synagogis, modus legendas prophetas, linguae ebrae inclinatio, ebrei unde dicti, lectionis in synagoga.

In 1546 he was said to have published a \\"false opinion\\" in that there were \\"supposed to be two different Messiahs, one of a host of unusual notions entertained by Anabaptists.\\" After fruitlessly searching in vain for a job as a teacher of theology, he returned to Chiavenna. Stancaro moved on to the Grisons and reached Transylvania by the end of 1548, where he had support from Isabella Jagiellon, who provided introductions for him. In 1549 he obtained work as a teacher of theology at the University of Cracow, a position which he was forced to abandon when in March 1550 he was denounced as a Protestant for denying the Catholic doctrine of the intercession of saints. While at the University of Cracow, he is said to have argued that the Eucharist was a promise of a gift to be bestowed in heaven, and not the real flesh and blood of Christ. The small school of theologians who came to agree with this position were labelled Arrhabonarii after the Greek word , Arrha, meaning \\"earnest\\". In Poland his oratorical talents and scholarship was recognized, particularly amongst the aristocracy. Barbara Sher Tinsley says of him, \\"Stancaro pursued a line of reasoning that actually encouraged some orthodox colleagues to defend Antitrinitarian positions in Poland and accidentally caused the downfall of Reform in that country. Still, [as Pierre Bayle admitted], Stancaro was one of the most successful people who had worked to established the Reformed faith in Poland.\\" Although Stancaro believed in the co-equality of the Son and the Father and acknowledged both natures, human and divine, of Christ, he believed that \\"Christ was mediator by virtue of his humanity, not by virtue of his divinity, in order not to subordinate the Son to the Father.\\" He was imprisoned in Lipowitz but obtained the protection of some Polish nobles and his escape was arranged, and, with help from Calvinist nobleman Mikołaj Oleśnicki, was able to set up the Helvetic-Italian Reformed Church of Poland in Pińczów. He engaged in debate with a small circle of Protestants in the town such as Jan Laski, Piotr of Goniądz and Peter Martyr Vermigli; his contemporaries considered Stancaro to be hot-tempered and arrogant, tendentious in his beliefs. Yet he was considered to be a \\"highly cultivated man, a refined student of Hebrew.\\" According to Pierre Bayle and others, Stancaro convinced Oleśnicki to banish all of the monks from Pińczów. Stancaro led the first Protestant service at the church on 25 November 1550, but his term as pastor was to prove short-lived; a royal decree of December 12, 1550 imposed the dissolution of the church and Stancaro had to leave Poland to Germany. He was criticized by Stanislas Orzechowski, who had turned against Protestantism, and authored a popular work denouncing his beliefs. Andreas Musculus who debated the Osiandrian controversy with Stancaro in 1552. Stancaro moved on to Königsberg, where he obtained the chair of Hebrew at the University of Königsberg in May 1551, before moving on to Frankfurt (Oder). At this point he was involved in the Osiandrian controversy. Stancaro's views on the trinity were challenged and contradicted by the theologian Andreas Musculus in a public discussion held in Berlin on October 10, 1552. Stancaro's writing Apologia contra Osiandrum rendered the dispute so violent that the Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg summoned Melanchthon and Bugenhagen from Wittenberg to Frankfurt in the autumn of 1552 in order to investigate the dispute.Artikel „Stancarus, Franciscus“ von Paul Tschackert in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 35 (1893), S. 436–439, (in German), Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource They did not travel, but Melanchthon stated in opposition to Stancaro that Christ, like a priest, was a mediator in two natures. Melanchthon published Responsio de controversiis Stancari scripta in June 1552, and Stancaro was forced to leave Frankfurt. Around this time he published Canones Reformationis (also Canones reformationis ecclesiarum Polonicarum or Riformatione), although some give the date of publication as earlier and state 1548 or 1550; the truth though appears to be that he drafted the work in Pińczów in 1650 and published it two years later while in Frankfurt-on-the-Oder in 1552. The work of 50 theological propositions received considerable attention amongst Polish noblemen and their wives in the 1550s. He continued an itinerant existence in Eastern Europe; indeed Stephen Edmondson refers to him as the \\"wandering Italian theologian\\". Stancaro authored De Trinitate et Mediatore Domino nostro Iesu Christo adversus Henricum Bullingerum...Ad magnificos et generosos Dominos Nobiles ac eorum Ministeros a variis Pseudoevabelicis seductis a decade later in 1562 in which he offered his views on the issue, mainly in response to the letters of Peter Martyr Vermigli, a strong critic of Stancero. In November 1554 he settled in Transylvania, enjoying the protection of the Hungarian lord Péter Petrovics, who he served as a personal physician to at his castle. During his time with Petrovics he influenced numerous people in Hungary such as the Debrecen clergyman Tamás Arany, who became involved in a heated debate with Calvinist bishop Péter Melius Juhász over Antitrinitarian issues. After the death of his patron in May 1559, he returned to Poland where he published his Collatio doctrinae Arrii et Melanchthonis Philippi, in which Philip Melanchthon accused him of Arianism. For this reason he came into conflict with Francesco Lismanini and Jan Laski, leading to imprisonment on 28 June 1559 at Wlodzislaw. Stancaro was released and moved to Dubiecko. Here he was involved in the Synod of Książ, held in September 1560, and a year later he founded a Reformed church, an existence which was to be short-lived. During his time in Dubiecko he authored Collatio doctrinae Arrii, et Philippi Melanchthonis, et sequacium Arrii et Philippi Melanchthonis et Francisci Davidis et reliquorum Saxonum doctrina de Filio Dei, Domino Jesu Christo, vna est et eadem and De officiis mediatoris domini Jesu Christi et secundum quam naturam haec officia exhibuerit et executusd fuerit. In 1562 he settled in Stopnica, where he led a comparatively quiet life in retirement. He died on November 12, 1574.

In these telescopes a hand held eyepiece and an objective mounted on a ball joint were connected by a string; the observer kept the string tight and moved the eyepiece to aim the telescope. Another example of an infinite-axis telescope is a ball-in-cup mounted telescope, also called a spherical-mounted telescope. The first Newtonian telescope was mounted in this way; the ball was held in place by wrought iron springs. Another type uses a bowling balls as a mount axis. There are modern commercial and amateur mount designs for Newtonian telescopes that have the \\"ball\\" built into the base of the optical tube assembly. These mounts have the advantage of being mechanically simple and allow the observer to rotate the eyepiece to any side of the telescope for easier viewing. Some types have even been adapted for equatorial tracking by motorizing one of the bearing surfaces to turn the ball at the rate of one revolution per day. This rotates the telescope's ball exactly opposite the rotation of the Earth, thus keeping the telescope stationary with respect to the stars. Small, hand-held (richest-field) telescopes may also qualify as infinite-axis telescopes. An advantage of infinite-axis telescopes is that there is no \\"dead-zone\\" where one axis must move infinitely fast in order to track the stars, as is the case with alt- azimuth mounts.

Hall Federal Building and United States Courthouse is an historic building located in Joplin, Missouri. Completed in 1904 and added to in 1936, the courthouse was constructed during a time of initial growth for the City of Joplin, following several years of civic effort to obtain a Federal Post Office and Courthouse. Originally constructed to house a U.S. Post Office, Federal Court Room and offices for various public agencies, today it stands as a well-preserved example of the neo-classical revival style popular in Federal buildings of the period. The building served as a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri from 1904 to 1999. It is named for U.S. Representative Durward Gorham Hall. History Since the early 1890s, the City of Joplin, Missouri had been petitioning for a Federal government building in Joplin. The new Federal building, designed by the Department of the Treasury at Third and Joplin Streets, started construction in 1903. It was overseen by government supervisor H.G. Ritchey, and opened for business December 19, 1904. Plans and specifications for the building were prepared and dated December 19, 1902. It was completed for a total cost of $150,000. In the opening announcement article in The Joplin Globe, December 18, 1904, the city's pride in the new facility is evident: \\"It's a long story, the history of the government building in Joplin, a story of hope deferred and patience tried, but as the public files into the post office tomorrow morning it may be confidently predicted that it was worth waiting for\\". Due to the continued growth of Joplin and especially the demands on the Post Office, in 1922 and 1923, requests for an addition to the original structure was made to the Supervising Architect, Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. In 1935, construction of two additional wings was started, and a grand opening was held on October 8, 1936. Senator Harry S. Truman spoke at the opening ceremonies. Architectural Description The original Joplin Federal Building and Courthouse was completed in 1904. It contained the post office on the first floor and part of the basement, the Federal courtroom and associated offices on the second floor and Federal Marshal's and other offices on the third floor. The basement also contained the mechanical equipment for the coal fired steam heating system. The Joplin Globe article of December 18, 1904, describes the public area of the ground floor: The uses remained fairly constant until the post office moved to a new facility in 1962. At that time, the General Services Administration acquired the building and converted the first floor to office space, obscuring some of the original detailing. The fire and life safety systems have been upgraded and facilities for the disabled have been provided. In 1964, the third floor was air-conditioned and a few years later the rest of the building was air-conditioned, utilizing lay-in ceilings, which obscured much of the original detailing. In 1978, the original wood windows were replaced with fixed glass and aluminum frames. In 1992 and 1993, the air- conditioning and heating systems were replaced. The main lobby was retained as the building entry lobby with some of the original detailing remaining at the ceiling and exterior walls. Site The Federal Building and Courthouse is located in the Central Business District of Joplin on the corner of Third and Joplin Streets. It is surrounded by two and three story, turn of the century, commercial buildings on the west, north, and south. The new city library is directly across Joplin Street to the east. The only on-site parking is a small surface lot to the south. The primary facades of the building face the east toward Joplin Street and north toward Third Street. The main entry is centered on the Joplin Street facade. The 1936 addition filled the site to the original west property line. The original site plan indicated concrete curbs at the north and east sides of the building, which remain today. The north entry has been moved one bay to the west and the formal steps at the main east entry have been replaced with a disabled access ramp and new stair. Window wells, to provide daylight into basement spaces, are covered with original decorative wrought iron bars. There are small landscaped yards at the north and part of the east sides. Building The Federal Building and Courthouse was designed in the era of centralized Federal government buildings that preceded the Great Depression, and during the secondary growth and development of the West. The building program was the result of rapid growth following the development of natural resources, with the influx of population resulting in the formation of cities, all of which demanded services as well as law and order. Federal design policies of standardization that were implemented as attempts to meet this demand were executed. Building designs were generated from the Department of the Treasury and its supervising architect. The Federal Building in Joplin is 36,228 square feet in size including the 1936 addition. The exterior design of the building combines Federal and Renaissance Revival styles typical of the Department of the Treasury designs of the period. Drawings for the Joplin Post Office were signed by James Knox Taylor, Supervising Architect in 1902. Rectangular in plan, the original building measured 98'-8\\" across the primary facade, 53'-4\\" deep, and stood 56'-0\\" tall. The 1936 addition to the west side of the building extended the basement and ground floor an additional 55'-0\\". This addition continued the full height of the building on the north and south facades with two wings 29'-10\\" wide, resulting in a two level light court 37'-8\\" wide and 55'-0\\" deep. Today's building is almost square at the basement and first levels, and 'U' shaped at the second, third and roof levels. The two primary facades of the building are faced in Carthage limestone, with a smooth faced modular red brick on the upper levels. The secondary facades have limestone accent detailing with the same red brick between. The brick mortar is white with a tooled joint accenting the red brick. The 1936 addition was blended into the original construction at the north facade, resulting in an integrated appearance. The juncture at the south elevation between the original building and the 1986 addition was less well integrated, changing from brick to limestone at the joint. The primary facade is divided into five bays, with two end bays, 19'-8\\" wide, recessed back 1'-0\\" from the three center bays. These end bays are accented with limestone quoins at the sides, and decorative limestone detailing at the second level windows. The center three bays are accented with limestone detailing for the full height, and three two-story arch-top windows opening into the two level courtroom on the second level. At the first level, the center bay contains the main building entrance, flanked by identical bays originally containing double hung windows. The arch-top windows are flanked at the second and third levels with Ionic capital flat limestone pilasters, with a stone balustrade at the second level. The facade is capped with a limestone dentil cornice, which is topped with a limestone balustrade. Originally, the windows were wood frame and sash without division. The three central arch-top windows originally were divided vertically into three sections, with these mulls extending through the arch. A 1978 renovation replaced all the wood windows with fixed aluminum windows. The arch-top central windows now have closed arch-tops and are divided into two sections rather than the original three. The original limestone entry stair has been replaced with a brick access ramp and stair combination. The original bronze framed rotating entry door has been changed to an aluminum storefront system. The window pattern continues around the other three building elevations and inside the rear, second and third level light court. The full height wings and the single story portion at the back of the building, added during the 1936 extension, originally served as the Post Office Workroom. The north wing, added during the same 1936 program, carry the original limestone and brick detailing back to within 7'-3\\" of the west corner. At that point, the original brick continues to the corner and across the west and south facade, but the limestone detailing ceases. The original building, prior to the 1936 extension, carried the limestone detailing around all four sides of the building. In the central light court a large, linear skylight added in 1936, which was used to help illuminate the Post Office Workroom, has been removed. =Structure= The original building structure is structural steel columns encased in masonry, with a structural steel floor frame, infilled with wood floor system joists and decking, and exterior brick masonry walls. The ceiling above the attic is wood framed; and the roof is framed with steel trusses, wood purlins, and decked with wood. The 1936 addition structure is structural steel columns encased in concrete; and the first, second and third floors are one-way (ribbed) reinforced concrete over structural steel floor framing. The roof is steel frame with mesh reinforced concrete deck. =Interior= Although the U.S. Postal Service no longer utilizes the building, the original post office lobby is mostly intact and well maintained. The original terrazzo and marble floor has been covered with vinyl asbestos tile (VAT), and the original marble base has had rubber base applied to it. The varnished oak detailing at the exterior walls and windows is well maintained and mostly intact. The plaster detailing in the ceiling is mostly intact although non- period light fixtures have been installed. The original highly detailed postal screen has been removed and a drywall partition has been installed in its place. The southern bay of the lobby has been walled off to create a new office space. The decorative varnished oak leading into the old Post Master's office is mostly intact and well maintained. The rest of the floor is divided by drywall partitions. Ceilings are 2x4 lay-in acoustical tile, concealing air-conditioning ducts and original plaster ceilings. The floors are all vinyl asbestos tile (VAT). Originally, an open decorative wrought iron, marble, and oak stairwell, extended from the lobby through the third floors enfolding a north entry vestibule under the landing. Today, the entry has been moved west and this stair has been enclosed with walls and doors and enfolds an elevator in its center. In several places the stair and railing have been cut. The original decorative, rotating entry door has been removed and a varnished oak airlock with aluminum doors has been installed. The original secondary exit at the north wall has been turned into a window to make room for the elevator, and an aluminum door installed at the next window location to the west. At the second floor stair/elevator lobby, the original, leather covered, brass nailed courtroom door, remains concealed behind a steel fire door. The terrazzo and marble floors have been covered with vinyl asbestos tile (VAT). Inside the courtroom, the original varnished oak paneled walls, bar and benches, are all intact. The ceiling has had a lay-in ceiling installed, although the tile has been removed exposing the original decorative plaster detailing. The lay-in ceiling grid cuts across the three main facade arch-top windows. The original light fixtures are still in place above the lay-in ceiling grid. The rest of the second floor and the third floor are divided into offices, mostly as they were constructed in 1936. The corridors and most of the offices are lined with varnished and painted oak wainscoting and door and window trim. The oak trim has been cut off at the transom level to install lay-in ceilings, which conceals air-conditioning ductwork. The oak floors have been covered with plywood and vinyl asbestos tile (VAT). The basement finishes are similar to the other floors, except that the finish under the vinyl flooring is concrete, and lay-in ceilings have not been installed. Some of the original oak doors, frames, and transoms are intact, but have been painted white. Between the old Postal Swing Room and the toilet facilities, the observation areaway and viewports are still intact. At all levels the toilets mostly are still intact in the form in which they were revised during the 1936 remodel. The toilet partitions and wainscoting are marble. The period ceramic fixtures have nickel fixtures and fittings. The mechanical systems have been totally renovated and replaced in recent years, with the steam radiators removed from the building.

Plot  As the police arrive at Dexter's house, he is obviously in shock and, either because he feels guilty that his relationship with the Trinity Killer, Arthur Mitchell, caused Rita's death or because he is answering a question (\\"Sir, did you say that you called this in?\\") asked by one of the police officers, admits \\"it was me\\". Joey Quinn is already suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Rita's death, considering it did not follow Trinity's modus operandi. He is also suspicious of Dexter's unemotional manner after the incident. Astor takes Rita's death particularly hard, and blames Dexter for it. Unable to reconcile, Astor decides that she wants to live with her grandparents in Orlando, Florida, and she and Cody leave Miami. Miami Metro begins investigating a severed head left in a Venezuelan neighborhood, and also find several related cases. The suspect is quickly nicknamed the Santa Muerte Killer. The FBI, unable to find Arthur Mitchell, follows its only other lead, Kyle Butler (Dexter's alias when interacting with the Mitchell family). Quinn recognizes the similarities between sketches of Kyle Butler and Dexter. Dexter finds a Department of Sanitation worker, Boyd Fowler, who is responsible for the deaths of several women. Dexter hires a nanny named Sonya to care for Harrison. Dexter eventually kills Fowler, but the crime is witnessed by Fowler's next victim Lumen Pierce whom he has in captivity. Dexter tries to care for Lumen, but she is understandably suspicious of his motives, asking Dexter if he is going to \\"sell her\\". Quinn tracks down the Mitchells, who are now in witness protection. He approaches Jonah Mitchell at a small convenience store and shows him a picture of Dexter, asking if it is Kyle Butler, but an undercover FBI agent interrupts before Jonah can answer. Quinn is suspended without pay by LaGuerta for disobeying her orders as she continues to defend Dexter. With Dexter's help, Deb closes in on the Santa Muerte killer. Debra lets him escape during a hostage standoff in order to save the hostage's life. Lumen tells Dexter that she was attacked by a group of men, not merely Fowler on his own. Lumen asks Dexter to help her seek revenge on these men, but he initially refuses. After Lumen continues on her own and mistakenly targets the wrong suspect, Dexter teaches her the importance of knowing a person is guilty. Dexter accompanies Lumen to the airport and believes she has left Miami. Instead, Lumen remains behind, hunts down and shoots one of her attackers, and out of desperation asks Dexter to help her clean up the crime scene. Dexter reluctantly agrees, and they finish moments before homicide police locate the crime scene. Lumen later reveals to Dexter that killing one of her attackers brought her a sense of peace. She tearfully recognizes that it will not last and that she will have to find (and kill) the others to experience that peace again. Dexter recognizes this as being her own Dark Passenger. He decides to help her, partly to atone for his earlier inability to save Rita. Meanwhile, LaGuerta and Angel Batista make their marriage public but are having marital issues, and Quinn and Debra become romantically involved. When Angel gets involved in a bar fight which gets him in trouble with the Internal Affairs Department (IAD), LaGuerta saves him by helping IAD set up a sting on another cop who is under suspicion, Stan Liddy. Liddy develops a friendship with Quinn, their common bond being they were both \\"betrayed\\" by LaGuerta, and Quinn pays Liddy to investigate Dexter. Debra remains unaware that Quinn suspects her brother is Kyle Butler. Dexter and Lumen hunt the other people responsible for torturing her, including their leader, motivational speaker Jordan Chase, and people associated with him. As Quinn's relationship with Deb deepens, he tries to stop Liddy's investigation, but by this point Liddy has taken pictures of Dexter and Lumen on Dexter's boat disposing of large plastic bags and video of them practicing for a kill, and is determined to continue. Having lost his job and convinced Dexter is a criminal, Liddy captures Dexter and calls Quinn to tell him to come to his location. A struggle ensues and Dexter kills Liddy and destroys Liddy's surveillance footage. Dexter learns Lumen has been kidnapped by Jordan Chase and is forced to leave the crime scene to try to find her. Quinn, having responded to a call from Liddy, finds Liddy's van locked and apparently empty; a drop of Liddy's blood falls on his shoe, unnoticed. Dexter returns home to collect his tools to attack Jordan. He is surprised to see Astor and Cody who want to have their baby brother Harrison's first birthday party in Miami and stay with him the coming summer. Before Dexter can confront Jordan, he is called away to Liddy's crime scene, where the police suspect Quinn's involvement in Liddy's death. Quinn initially complies but later refuses to answer questions. Later, Dexter learns of Jordan's (and Lumen's) whereabouts. The two briefly struggle. Dexter overpowers Jordan, and then allows Lumen to kill Jordan. After the kill, Deb discovers the two of them, though they are behind translucent plastic and she is not able to see their identities. Understanding that one of the two figures must be an escaped victim, Deb sympathizes and retreats so they can escape. After Jordan's death, Lumen no longer feels the need to kill and tearfully admits she needs to move on, leaving Dexter distraught. Quinn talks with Dexter at Harrison's birthday party, where Quinn thanks Dexter for exonerating him, as Dexter has faked a blood test to clear Quinn. Quinn and Deb appear to reconcile, as do Maria and Angel. Blowing out Harrison's birthday candle, Dexter wonders if there is hope for him — to have a genuine relationship, to be human — but he doubts it.  Cast = Main  * Michael C.

These are short poems suitable for dedicatory purposes written in the form of elegiac couplets.John Madison Cooper, D. S. Hutchinson, (1997), Plato, Complete works, page 1742. Hackett Publishing. TextPeople, Places and Pantheon Typically of ancient Greek literature (and regardless of their Platonic authenticity), the Epigrams clearly refer to historical personalities, various places in and around ancient Greece, and specific characters of Greek mythology. People The Ludovisi Cnidan Aphrodite, a Roman marble copy of the original Aphrodite of Knidos, sculpted by Praxiteles and referred to in epigram 17 * Hecuba: queen of Troy. The Trojan loss of the Trojan war, as described in the Iliad, explains the decree of tears for Hecuba and the women of Troy at the hands of the Fates, who represent the harsher inevitabilities of the human condition, such as death and destiny. * Dion: the political figure of Syracuse whose campaign is discussed at length in the Platonic Epistles, or Letters. * Alexis: possibly one of a number of already- named ancient personalities, or else a new personality of the same name altogether. * Phaedrus: Plato's contemporary; namesake of the Platonic dialogue of the same name. * Archeanassa: a possible historical romantic interest of Plato's. * Agathon: Athenian tragic poet, known for appearing in Plato's Symposium. * Xanthippe: Socrates' wife. The pertinent epigram may therefore represent Socrates' courtship of Xanthippe. * Laïs: A reference to either of the courtesans Lais of Corinth or Lais of Hyccara, the two being historically confused in ancient literature, and therefore inextricably linked. * Pindar: lyric poet, whose association with the muses is a compliment of his skill. * Sappho: female lyric poet, whose skill is likewise complimented by counting her as a tenth muse, a common appellation for Sappho in the ancient historical record. * Praxiteles: sculptor. The epigram is a poetic compliment of his skill, as in its telling, the (later often-copied) Aphrodite of Knidos is beheld by Aphrodite herself, and is judged by her to be a perfect likeness. * Aristophanes: comic playwright. As the Graces represent the happier elements of the human condition, it is fitting that they would be associated with Aristophanes in epigram 18. Places Well-known place names mentioned in the Epigrams include Troy, Greece itself, the Aegean Sea, and Athens. More specific references include: * Colophon: a city of ancient Greece, present day western Turkey. * Euboea: a large island in central Greece, just off the mainland, near Athens. * Eretria: a city in Euboea. * Susa: a city of ancient Persia, present day western Iran. * Ecbatana: another city of ancient Persia, present day western Iran. * Lesbos: an island in Eastern Greece, near present-day Turkey, historical home of Sappho. * Cnidus (Knidos), then a Greek city in present-day southwestern Turkey, site of the aforementioned Aphrodite of Knidos sculpture. Mythological Figures * The Fates: in their capacity for terrible assignment of destiny to humans, the Fates are mentioned as decreeing tears to Trojan women. * The Muses: mentioned twice, the Muses are associated with the creative efforts of Pindar and Sappho. * The Graces: representing the happier elements of the human condition, the Graces are associated with Aristophanes. * \\"The Paphian\\" and \\"Cypris\\": both names refer to the goddess Aphrodite who, according to legend, rose from the sea at Paphos, southwestern Cyprus. The first \\"Cypris\\" of epigram 17 therefore refers to the goddess herself, while the second \\"Cypris\\" refers to the famous, lost (though often-copied) statue of her likeness, the Aphrodite of Knidos, which Aphrodite is acknowledging as a perfect likeness.

As of 2020, it has three traditional branches and one loan production office. It is the last remaining traditionally black-community oriented bank headquartered west of Dallas. On August 26, 2020, its parent company, Broadway Financial Corporation, announced a merger with DC-based City First Bank to form the largest Black-led financial institution in the US, with over a billion dollars in assets.  History  In 1946, Broadway Federal Savings and Loan Association was founded by a group of civic minded people to provide bank services to minorities in the greater Los Angeles area, who were not being serviced by any of the existing financial institutions. The bank received its charter on November 26, 1946 with an initial investment of $150,000. It opened for business in a three-room office on 4329 South Broadway on January 11, 1947.http://www.broadwayfederalbank.com Real estate broker and investor H. A. Howard served as the first president of the company until September 1949 when Dr. H. Claude Hudson, investor, community activist and dentist, took over leadership. The savings and loan grew rapidly under Chairman of the Board Hudson’s supervision. In 1954, Broadway Federal acquired a larger building at Broadway and 45th Street, which was redesigned by renowned architect Paul Williams, who was also a founding board member. Broadway Federal grew to become the second largest black-owned bank in the United States. In 1966, its branch expansion began with a location in the Mid- Town area of Los Angeles. This branch was also designed by Paul Williams. In 1972, Dr. Hudson retired from active management of Broadway Federal and his son, Elbert T. Hudson, an attorney, community activist and long-time board member was selected as board chairman and CEO. Elbert T. Hudson served as CEO until March 1992, when his son, Paul C. Hudson, also an attorney and community activist took over. Shortly after Paul C. Hudson’s appointment as CEO, a fire destroyed Broadway Federal’s main branch during the civil unrest that occurred in the wake of Rodney King beating trial verdict. Despite this setback, management reaffirmed its commitment to the community. In December 1995, Broadway began its conversion from a mutual savings and loan to a stock savings bank. The IPO raised close to $9 million. Broadway Financial Corporation is the parent holding company of what is now known as Broadway Federal Bank. Broadway Financial is publicly traded on the NASDAQ market as (symbol: BYFC). The company is currently managed by Wayne-Kent A. Bradshaw, who joined the Bank as President and Chief Operating Officer in 2009, and became Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank in 2012. Under Mr. Bradshaw’s leadership, Broadway has continued its focus on serving low-to- moderate income communities, with a particular focus on lending for multi- family housing. This focus addresses the chronic need for affordable housing that exists throughout all of Southern California, especially for those families living within low-to-moderate income communities. The Bank also offers a variety of other residential and commercial real estate loan products for consumers, businesses, and non-profit organizations, other loan products, and a variety of deposit products, including checking, savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposits and retirement accounts.  Loan Officer Kickback Scandal  In 2014, a former Broadway Federal Bank loan officer pled guilty in a scheme to receive kickbacks from brokers for processing unqualified church mortgage applications. Broadway would normally pay a discount rebate to brokers who brought loans to the bank. From 2007 to 2010, he \\"demanded from the brokers that all or part of that rebate amount be paid to him.\\" According to the Department of Justice, the scheme netted the loan officer $350,000, and caused losses to the bank of at least $4.2 million. However, after the officer's sentencing in 2016, the bank's CEO revealed that $90M church loans were originated by the loan officer, many of which were fraudulent, and could have caused losses as high as $30 million. The bank stopped processing church loans in 2010, and subsequently has reduced the portfolio of its mortgages to churches to a small percentage of its assets. Due in part of the losses incurred by the bad loans, the bank received a $15 million loan from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which the Treasury Department converted into shares of the bank's stock in 2013, making it the largest single shareholder until 2020.  Attempted Hostile Takeover  In February 2020, Steven A. Sugarman, the former CEO of Banc of California, attempted to take over Broadway Federal with an unsolicited bid. He had previously purchased the remaining portfolio of Broadway's stock from the Treasury Department under his business Sugarman Enterprises, and assigned it to his subsidiary business The Capital Corps LLC, making him the bank's biggest shareholder, with 1.8 million (9.6%) of the outstanding stock. On June 19 (Juneteenth), 2020 due to increased interest and online activism promoting black businesses, the stock price of the bank went up over 300%, to a historic high of $7.23. Afterwards, Sugarman revealed that he would no longer pursue a buy-out, after selling his entire stake in the bank for an average of $2.59 per share. Merger with City First Bank On August 26, 2020, Broadway Financial Corp announced it would be combining with CFBanc Corporation, based in Washington, DC in a \\"transformational merger of equals\\" which would create the largest Black-led Minority Depository Institution in the US, with over $1B in assets. The merger was unanimously approved by the Boards of both banks, and expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2021. The combined bank would keep the current bi-coastal headquarters, with an aim to expand into other urban regions. CFBanc's current President and CEO Brian E. Argrett will take over the reigns as CEO of the merged institution, with Broadway's CEO, Wayne-Kent Bradshaw serving as the new Chairman of the Board of Directors.

British engineer John Hoyte led an expedition that tried to reenact aspects of Hannibal's legendary crossing of the Alps during the Second Punic War in 218 BCE. The group successfully took the female Asian elephant Jumbo, provided by a zoo in Turin, from France over the Col du Mont Cenis into Italy.  Background  One possible invasion route proposed for Hannibal's army After the Carthaginian defeat in the First Punic War of 264–241 BCE, Hamilcar Barca secured an extensive territory in the Iberian peninsula for Carthage. At the beginning of the Second Punic War in 218 BCE, his son Hannibal took an army of perhaps 50,000 men and 37 war elephants from Hispania (modern-day Spain) to Italy, where he led a 15-year campaign against Rome. Hannibal avoided the coastal route, and took his army over the Alps. His march has been described by ancient historians Polybius and Livy. The exact route, however, has been subject of long but inconclusive scholarly discourse. In his 1955 book Alps and elephants: Hannibal's march, Gavin de Beer lists 12 possible candidates from 30 different books.  The expedition  In 1955, The Times published a debate about the route Hannibal might have taken over the Alps. This debate came to the attention of John Hoyte, then an engineering student at Cambridge University. Hoyte had an interest in both history and mountain climbing, and spent the summer of 1956 with friends hiking the Alps and comparing possible routes to the ancient descriptions. The group came to the conclusion that the Col de Clapier was the most likely pass, an opinion still supported by some modern historians. A few years later, a friend suggested to test this theory with an actual elephant. Hoyte wrote letters to the British consuls in Lyon, France, Geneva, Switzerland, and Turin, enquiring about the possibility of obtaining an elephant for the experiment, but without a serious expectation of success. However, the Turin Zoo had just acquired a female Asian elephant, Jumbo, who was trained as a circus animal. The owner of the zoo volunteered Jumbo and became the first sponsor of the expedition. Hoyte put together a team of 8 people, including Richard Jolly as the expedition secretary and Colonel John Hickman, Lecturer (later Reader) in Veterinary Surgery at the University of Cambridge Veterinary School, who had gained experience with elephants during World War II in Burma. The group obtained insurance for Jumbo from Lloyd's of London and further sponsorship from Life magazine, which later published a 7-page photo report. The originally planned route led over the Col de Clapier The expedition started in late July 1959 in Montmelian, France. It followed the valley of the Arc river and then ascended towards the Col de Clapier. However, the route up to the pass had become narrowed and dangerous due to rockfall. The group retreated down into the valley and crossed the Col du Mont Cenis, another pass suggested for Hannibal's route by none less than French emperor Napoleon. After 10 days of travel, the expedition successfully \\"invaded\\" Susa in Italy. The members of the expedition originally planned to call the 5,700 pound (2.6 t) elephant Hannibella, however, the animal could not be made to respond to the new name and thus remained Jumbo. Jumbo was 11 years old and equipped with leather boots and knee pads for the most treacherous passages. A specially made coat was provided to keep her warm. Despite a diet consisting of of hay, of apples, of bread, of carrots, and a vitamin B supplement per day, she lost an estimated during the first 4 days of the trip, and nearly in total. On arrival in Italy, she consumed cake and a Magnum bottle of Chianti. In 1960, Hoyte published a report on the expedition as Trunk Road for Hannibal: With an Elephant Over the Alps. Expedition member Cynthia Pilkington published the book \\"Elephant Over the Alps\\" in 1961, telling the story of the expedition.

Offaly. Froinsias Ó Maolmhuaidh (anglicized as Francis Molloy) was a Franciscan friar, theologian and grammarian, author of the first published grammar of the Irish language written in Latin, c. 1606–1677. Biography=Early life Ó Maolmhuaidh was born in the Diocese of Meath, most probably in the district of Fercall, lordship of The Ó Maolmhuaidh, in what was then called King's County. While his exact place within the Ó Maolmhuaidh family is unknown, he recorded stories heard in his youth \\"of a great Christmas banquet for 960 people, lasting twelve days, held by Calvagh O'Molloy, chief of his name, at the end of the sixteenth century.\\" He appears to have been an uncle to Reverend Seán Ó Dálaigh, a student at Saint Isidore's College, Rome, who seemed to have been the man who acted as censor librorum for Ó Maolmhuaidh's Grammatica. St. Isidore's church of the Irish left From Rome to Vienna and back again Ó Maolmhuaidh became a member of the Friars Minor of Strict Observance at the Irish College at Rome on 2 August 1632. In 1642 he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at Klosterneuberg, Vienna, when aged about thirty-six. It was then that his solely theological work, Disputatio theologica de incarnatione verbi ad mentem Joannis Duns Scoti was written, probably as a thesis. It was published in 1645. He received instructions while in Mantua, on 4 May 1647, to proceed to the Irish Franciscan College of St. Isidore, at Rome, to teach philosophy; he was teaching theology there in 1652, and was doing so as late as 1677. While he never seems to have become guardian of the college on the death of Luke Wadding in 1657, he was president for a time in 1671. Publications Ó Maolmhuaidh was still in Rome when his Iubilatio genethliaca in honorem Prosperi Baltharasaris Philippi Hispaniarum principis there in 1658. \\"By 1663 he was preparing a course on philosophy for publication. The first part of his Philosophia ... tomus primus dialectiae breviarum complectens was published at Rome in 1666, but no further part was published.\\" His best-known work, Lucerna fidelium, seu, Fasciclus decerptus ab authoribus magis versatis qui tractarunt de doctrin a Christiana (Lochrann na gCreidmheach), was an Irish-language catechism of Catholic church doctrine. It was published in Rome in 1676. This project dated back to 1670, when it was instigated by the secretary of Congregatio de Propaganda Fide, Monsignor Baldeschi, who, along with Cardinal Altieri (later Pope Clement X), were among his most influential friends and contacts in the city. His last printed work, Grammatica Latino-Hibernica nunc compendiata, was the first printed grammar of the Irish language, and published in 1677. It is in Latin, and consists of twenty-five chapters: nine on the letters of the alphabet, three on etymology, one on contractions and cryptic writings, and twelve on prosody and versification. At the end is an Irish poem by Molloy on the neglect of the ancient language of Ireland and the prospects of its resuscitation. As an Irish Franciscan He attended a general chapter of the order at Rome in 1664 on behalf of the Irish provincial superior. Final years While a commemorative stone at St. Isidore's College erected early in the 1900s gave 1684 as the year of his death, Ó Maolmhuaidh's decease has since been narrowed to sometime in the last quarter of 1677. He died while travelling through France for Ireland, in the company of Seán Ó Dálaigh.

The prints may have been made by a dinosauromorph that was a precursor to the dinosaurs, possibly closely related to Lagerpeton. Fossils of Prorotodactylus date back to the early Olenekian stage of the Early Triassic, making it the oldest known dinosauromorph. Its presence during this time extends the range of the dinosaur stem lineage to the start of the Early Triassic, soon after the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Prorotodactylus is the only ichnogenus within the ichnofamily Prorotodactylidae. Two ichnospecies are known, the type P. mirus and P. lutevensis. Specimens Prorotodactylus mirus, the type ichnospecies, has been found in the Holy Cross Mountains in Poland. It was named in 2000, with the specific name meaning \\"strange\\" in Latin in reference to unusual features in forefoot imprints. A second ichnospecies, P. lutevensis, was erected along with the type. P. lutevensis is from the Middle Triassic of France and was first described in 1984 as Rhynchosauroides lutevensis. It was reassigned on the basis of many similarities with P. mirus. P. mirus tracks have been found in many localities. The holotype specimen, a set of left forefoot and hind foot imprints, are from the Wióry locality near the town of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski. The footprints were located in the Labyrinthodontidae Beds of the Middle Buntsandstein, or Bunter sandstone. Recent studies of the biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy of the area have shown that the Wióry site is Early Spathian (Early to Late Olenekian) in age. More tracks have been found from Wióry since the initial description of P. mirus, and have shown that P. mirus was a rare component of the ichnofauna. P. mirus is also known from the Stryczowice locality, which has a much more diverse assemblage of ichnofossils than Wióry. Like in Wióry, Prorotodactylus tracks are rare in Stryczowice. Description Prorotodactylus tracks were made by a small quadrupedal animal. The tracks are long-striding, showing that the hind feet often overstepped the forefeet, or were placed on the same line. The first four digits of the hind foot, or pes, are clawed. Digits II-IV are angled skightly away from digit I, with digit IV being the longest. Digit V is smaller than the other four and is placed farther back on the foot, occurring only occasionally in footprints. The fifth digit of the forefoot, or manus, is separate from the rest of the digits, placed behind digits I-IV and angled outward. Digit III is the longest, with digits II and I being progressively smaller. The fifth digits of both the manus and pes are not rotated in Prorotodactylus as they are in the related ichnogenus Rotodactylus. The shape of the manus differentiates Prorotodactylus from members of the family Rhynchosauridae, which have also been found in Early Triassic Polish strata. The manus of Prorotodactylus is similar in shape to the pes of members of the ichnofamily Chirotheridae. Prorotodactylus tracks were probably made by a small dinosauromorph. The ichnogenus possesses several distinctively archosaurian features, such as narrow trackways and a pace angulation of 130°. The pace angulation, or the angle made between two successive footprints, shows that Prorotodactylus had an erect stance rather than a sprawling one. Dinosauromorph characteristics include digitigrade prints (in which only the digits touch the ground), bunched metatarsals, a reduction of the first and fifth digits, and the posterior deflection of the fifth digit. Prorotodactylus prints share several characteristics with the dinosauromorph genus Lagerpeton from Argentina, indicating that the print maker was closely related to Lagerpeton. The three central digits of the foot are parallel, a feature otherwise only seen in Lagerpeton. Digit IV is the longest digit in the foot of both Prorotodactylus and Lagerpeton. In both animals, there is a progressive decrease in size from digits IV to II, with digit III angled relative to the midline. The bunched metatarsals in Prorotodactylus are a synapomorphy of the clade Avemetatarsalia. The metatarsal pads, preserved only in deeply imprinted footprints, are united in a single unit. This makes the foot act as a single unit rather than a collection of splayed digits. In ichnotaxa similar in appearance to Prorotodactylus, the digits are not parallel to one another and the posterior margin of the metatarsal pads is curved, making the digits splay. Paleobiology Trackways indicate that the maker of Prorotodactylus footprints was quadrupedal. However, the overstep of the hind feet beyond the front feet indicates that the forelimbs were reduced, a characteristic of bipedal animals. Another Polish dinosauromorph ichnogenus, Sphingopus, occurs later in the Triassic and is fully bipedal. The transition to bipedality probably occurred between Prorotodactylus and Sphingopus. During this transition, body size also increased, as Sphingopus tracks are larger than those of Prorotodactylus. The different shapes of the manus and pes of Prorotodactylus may show different forms of specialization. The forelimbs, which were reduced, may have been used for hunting, grasping, or manipulating. The bunched metatarsals of the hind feet may have enabled the metatarsals to act as a lever, along with the stylopodium, or upper leg, and the zeugopodium, or lower leg. This would have enabled facultative bipedalism in Prorotodactylus, and a wholly bipedal gait in later dinosauromorphs. Pace angulation is relatively high in Prorotodactylus, and increased as bipedalism becomes obligate in later dinosauromorphs.

According to Pollstar, the tour earned $17.2 million between January 1, and June 30, 2010, which added onto her total of $86 million for her first ninety-three concerts in 2009, bringing the tour total to $103.2 million for the ninety-seven shows. While Beyoncé was on tour, she performed at a Las Vegas residency at the Encore Theatre in Las Vegas. Titled I Am... Yours, and the August 2, 2009 show was recorded and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009, titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. Production and filming I Am... World Tour was produced, directed and edited by Beyoncé for her own production company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from one-hundred-and-eight shows that took place in seventy-eight cities, thirty-two countries, and six continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that it was a lot of work for her, nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her film directed by herself. She explained: \\"I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [but] it was worth it.\\" At the New York City screening of the film, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely \\"hands-on\\", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating: \\"It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it.\\" Some of the behind-the-scenes footage was shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger the O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a twenty-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, \\"it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective\\". Film synopsis In addition to offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into Beyoncé's intimate world on tour, the film also features performances of over twenty songs with staging, choreography, lighting and production values. In between performances of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", which included a medley with Alanis Morissette's \\"You Oughta Know\\", viewers get glimpses of her childhood from old video footage. The footage transitions from Beyoncé dancing up a storm in her childhood home, to sleepless nights on tour where she worries about her health after nine consecutive days of touring, rehearsing, and recording. Despite her struggles, she sings Destiny's Child songs, \\"Bootylicious\\" and \\"Survivor\\", and asks for a guest appearance from Kanye West. For \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\", Beyoncé's performance is accompanied by YouTube footage of fans mimicking her moves, and a short video clip of then-President of the United States Barack Obama. In some of the raw moments captured in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: \\"Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God.\\" She told Entertainment Tonight: \\"I wanted to do something a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room.\\" The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic \\"At Last\\" set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, \\"I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams.\\" The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing \\"Halo\\" and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage. Release and promotion alt=The image of a woman who is singing. She wears a black leotard and holds a microphone with her right hand while she moves quickly her left hand. Many musical instruments are visible behind her. After Beyoncé finished her concert at the Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained that the idea of filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating \\"there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I looked out the window and there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked.\\" Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the film. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the film. A thirty-four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was launched on several websites in early November 2010. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé's official website during November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in Chelsea, Manhattan on November 21, 2010 to premiere the film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the film in New York City, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, in an interview with the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: \\"I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room.\\" The same day, Rolling Stone organized a competition where I Am... World Tour was one of the gifts for readers of the magazine. On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated: \\"I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about myself that I would never give to another director.\\" The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a ninety- minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas, shot at the Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. In the United States, the standard edition of the album was released exclusively at Walmart stores on November 26, 2010. The deluxe edition of I Am... World Tour includes the concert DVD, a live audio CD, an exclusive documentary, and a forty-page four- color booklet of never before seen photos of her journey around the world, and was made available on November 30, 2010 in several countries. The Blu-ray edition was released on December 7, 2010. A live instrumentals album was released digitally on February 1, 2011 and on double-sided vinyl on February 22. This is Beyoncé's third release of this nature but the first live instrumental album to have a physical release; the live instrumentals album from The Beyoncé Experience Live and I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas were her first two, only released digitally. On December 1, 2010, Entertainment Weekly offered a six-foot tall version of the poster signed by Beyoncé to one of the first ten people who posted a qualifying comment on the related post on their Facebook wall concerning the giveaway of the first ten copies of I Am... World Tour. On December 8, 2010, Perthnow collaborated with Beyoncé's official website for a competition where twenty copies of the album were available. Fans completed an entry form and signed up to receive one of the copies. Critical reception Andy Kellman of AllMusic awarded I Am... World Tour three out of five stars and stated: \\"for anyone but the most devout fans of Beyoncé, this will be overkill, and it doesn't have as much of the playfulness such as the pleasing diversions as the I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas set.\\" Simon Gage of Daily Express awarded it four out of five stars, complimenting Beyoncé's dance moves and praising her vocal capabilities, going on saying that she is \\"probably the most electric performer since Tina Turner\\" and calling her the \\"Queen of R&B;\\". She also praised the quality of the songs \\"Crazy in Love\\", \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and \\"Halo\\". Ian Drew of Us Weekly complimented the \\"high-energy performances\\" of Beyoncé on the songs by Destiny's Child and enjoyed the black-and-white behind-the-scenes footage. He also added that the singer is \\"most revelatory when tearing up over [her] missing husband Jay-Z on the road.\\" New Yorks Amy Odell described the DVD as a \\"cinematic masterpiece\\". Jam!s Darryl Sterdan gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said: \\"More than two hours of powerhouse vocal performances and high- energy choreography, accompanied by endless costume changes, eye-popping production and general fabulousness. You'll get tired just watching it.\\" Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald awarded it three out of five stars, stating that the good thing about the album is that it has a \\"wider range of songs\\", nevertheless they do not have the same \\"rump-rattling power\\" of the songs in The Beyoncé Experience simply because some songs are too short in duration, \\"Bootylicious\\" for instance. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although Beyoncé showed an emotional side of herself during the DVD, \\"Still, the shows go on in their high-heeled, wonderfully choreographed glory.\\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared the DVD with Taylor Swift's Journey to Fearless which aired as a special the same day as I Am... World Tour. He noted: \\"Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour placed her before much larger audiences, documenting her choreographed razzle-dazzle as she played arenas and stadiums in 2009–10.\\" He further said: \\"Beyoncé didn't explain: she performed. With costumes that made her a comic-book heroine, a cyborg, a club hottie, and a white-clad vision of purity, she worked her big stages with hip-pumping moves and a soul diva's voice, from creamy to raspy. The documentary quietly flaunted her consistency as a trouper in montages that segued multiple shows — supertitled in small type — with Beyoncé in the same outfit making the same moves, while the fans' nationalities changed around her. Yet for all her superhuman pep, she also came across as warmer than Ms. Swift. She grinned knowingly after belting a phrase into the bleachers, and she drew listeners into her own pop generalities. Andy Gill of The Independent was much less impressed with the DVD, qualifying it as an \\"unsatisfying, incoherent entertainment experience\\" even though she liked the way \\"the visual spectacle put everything in perspective\\". Accolades The concert film received a nomination for NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Variety – Series or Special at the 42nd NAACP Image Awards (2011). I Am...

World Tour (album)"},{"id":"29219997","text":"Mey-Air Transport A/S, trading as Mey-Air, was a Norwegian charter airline which operated from 1970 to 1974. Owned by shipping owner Hans Otto Meyer, the company flew both smaller ad hoc charter as well as inclusive tour (IT). Initially operating a varied fleet of ten Cessna, Beechcraft, Convair CV-240 and NAMC YS-11, these were largely sold in 1972 to make way for two Boeing 737-200. The company filed for bankruptcy following the demise of the charter market after the 1973 oil crisis. History Beechcraft Queen Air at Tampere–Härmälä Airport in 1971 Mey-Air was established as a charter airline in 1970, by shipping owner Hans Otto Meyer. Based at the then secondary Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, it intended both to target the ad hoc as well as the inclusive tour charter market. It initially took over two Convair CV-240 from Meyer, although these were sold in 1970 and 1971.Hagby: 287Hagby: 288 The airline followed up by buying eight aircraft of six different types, consisting of a Cessna 401,Hagby: 306 a Cessna 402B, a Cessna 421,Hagby: 305 two NAMC YS-11,Hagby: 231 two Beechcraft Queen Air,Hagby: 220Hagby: 221 and a Beechcraft King Air 100.Hagby: 311 These aircraft were quickly sold, and by the end of 1972 only the Cessna 401 was still in service. During 1970 Mey-Air operated a newspaper services out of Oslo to Copenhagen and onwards to Amsterdam and Paris. The Queenliners were used for this route. The IT market was undergoing a dramatic boom during this period, and in 1971Hagby: 231 Mey- Air acquired two Boeing 737-200 for Mediterranean IT flights. Their only later aircraft acquisition was a 1973 purchase of a Cessna 150 and a Convair CV-240.Hagby: 207 Boeing 737-200 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport in 1972 Mey-Air showed interest in 1972 in acquiring their concessions to operate the routes out of Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Despite the bankruptcy of the incumbent, Fjellfly, Mey-Air withdrew their interest in the routes. Starting in December 1972, Mey-Air started a cooperation with Falkereiser to fly Danish tourists to Norway. This agreement would become a liability as Mey-Air was not paid in full and eventually became of creditor of the tour operator after it went bankrupt in 1974. One of the 737s is prominently featured as the hijacked aircraft in the 1974 feature film Ransom. Following the 1973 oil crisis, Mey- Air was similar to other IT airlines adversely effected.

Caracara creightoni was a scavenger and oppurtunistic species instead of a predator like it’s sister extant species (C. plancus and C. cheriway). It lived during the late Pleistocene to the beginning of the Holocene era. Caracara latebrosus holotype, possible senior synonymC. creightoni stood 58 cm tall, was short- winged and likely a poor flier. This species went extinct as a result of humans arriving on its home islands and wiping out the bird's prey species. A 2,500 year old C. creightoni femur from an Abaco Islands blue hole yielded a nearly complete mitochondrial genome. The DNA shows that the species was closely related to the northern crested caracara and the southern crested caracara. The three species last shared a common ancestor between 1.2 and 0.4 million years ago, during the Pleistocene.

The central Castle Street is named after this fort. Under the administration of Gov. Álvarez de Fonseca, construction began in 1575 but it was the January 20, 1577 when it entered service. The castle was demolished to construct the Plaza de España, with the remains of the castle buried under it for centuries. On June 28, 2006, during the refurbishment of the Plaza of Spain, some remains were later found to belong to the castle. At that time were taken precautionary and protective measures in order to ensure the preservation of the find. There remain only a few walls of the original building on display in a tunnel under the Plaza de España. Today, the castle is a museum which houses the famous \\"Cañón Tigre\\" (Tiger Cannon), which shot a musketball to Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's right arm, which fractured his humerus bone in multiple places on July 25, 1797, the reason why he had his arm amputated.  Construction and use  The castle was the main defensive castle for Santa Cruz. It was constructed in 1575, with construction work starting on 15 December 1575, and the Cabildo moving the artillery there in 1577. The work was started by the then-governor of the island, Juan Alvarez de Fonseca. It was built on a reef in Bias Diaz Cove. The square-shaped building had a rampart at each corner. It was involved in battles against Blake on 30 April 1657; Jennings on 6 November 1706; and Nelson on 25 July 1797. It was also the residence of the Captains General and the Governors, and was the seat of the Military Government.  Destruction  The castle was demolished in 1928. The castle was remembered in the name of \\"Calle Castillo\\", Castle Street, in Santa Cruz.  Rediscovery and visitor centre  Cañón Tigre The Plaza de España was remodeled in 2006, and in June 2006 the remains of the castle were discovered. Due to its historical importance, the designs for the new plaza were modified to incorporate an underground gallery to display the remains, and an outline of the castle was added to the bottom of the plaza's lake. The remains under the Plaza de España are protected. One corner of the castle remains, and can be visited underneath the plaza, along with a small exhibition, operated by Museos de Tenerife. On 25 July 2009, the El Tigre cannon was installed in a dedicated room at the centre. The bronze cannon was constructed in Seville in the 18th century, and is long and weighs 2,000kg. It is said to be the cannon that injured Nelson during the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797).

Benun, 605 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment made by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey that the defendants infringed patents owned by Fujifilm Corporation. Factual background Fujifilm is the owner of patents in the design and production of single-use, disposable cameras, or lens-fitted film packages (LFFPs). After being used, a LFFP is taken by a customer to a film processor who opens the LFFP and processes the film. The empty LFFPs can be refurbished by a company by replacing the film as well as any broken or worn components. Defendant Polytech (Shenzhen) Camera Company (PC), a subsidiary of co-defendant Polytech Enterprises Ltd. (PE), operated a factory in China that refurbished LFFPs originally sold by Fujifilm outside the US. Defendant Jazz Products LLC, owned by defendant Jack C. Benun, purchased refurbished LFFPs from Polytech Camera to be sold in the US.Weil, Gotshal, & Manges LLP. Patent Law Update: Fujifim Corp v. Benun, Federal Circuit Rejects Foreign Sales as Triggering Patent Exhaustion. Weil Briefing: Patent Ligation and Licensing. (June 3, 2010). In 2005, Fujifilm successfully sued Jazz Photos, another company owned by Benun, for patent infringement and was awarded $30 million, forcing both Jazz and Benun to file for bankruptcy. Despite the district court's preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from infringing, Jazz Products purchased about 1.4 million LFFPs made by Polytech and re-imported them into the US. In 2006, the district court found the defendants in contempt of the preliminary injunction, and approved $2 per infringing LFFP running royalty.Siegal, Matthew W. and Hansen, Kristopher M. \\"Free and Clear\\" Bankruptcy Sales Do Not Extinguish Claims of Patent Infringement. Bloomberg Law Reports. Vol. 2, No. 35. Circuit Court Opinion The defendants appealed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court waived one of the four issues presented by the defendants and rejected the other three. Estoppel The defendants contended that \\"the court invoked non-mutual collateral estoppel and precluded Polytech from presenting its permissible repair and first sale defenses on the basis of court proceedings to which Polytech was not a party.\\" However, this argument was waived because it was not raised at the right time during the defendants' 50(a) motion for judgement as a matter of law and 50(b) post-trial motion. Territoriality Requirement In Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.,. the Supreme Court ruled that Intel selling chips to Quanta exhausted LG's patent rights. LG licensed Intel to use its patent, and the patent is practiced when Quanta combined Intel's chips with non-Intel hardware, triggering patent exhaustion. The defendants argued that the Quanta case eliminated the territoriality requirement, hence's Fujifilm's sales of LFFP outside the US exhausted its patent rights as well, allowing the defendants to refurbish and resell them in the US. However, because the Quanta case did not involve foreign sales, the Circuit Court rejected the defendants' argument. Damage Unwarranted The defendants contended that the running royalty of $2.00 per infringing LFFP and the $2.5 million lump sum are \\"excessive, punitive, and unsupported by substantial evidence.\\" Based on factors such as the defendants' dependence on a Fujifilm license, Customs excluding infringing LFFPs, and the defendants' inability to separate the infringing LFFPs from the non-infringing ones, Fujifilm demonstrated that the jury could have reached a royalty rate as high as $2.21; and a similar logic applies as well for the lump sum award. Contempt of Preliminary Order The defendants challenged whether the court properly held them in contempt of a preliminary order enjoining importation of infringing LFFPs. They argued that 1) the contempt was not sufficiently supported by evidence of infringement, 2) the imported LFFPs were redesigned, and 3) Fujifilm's patent rights were terminated during the bankruptcy sale. The first two arguments were rejected based on fact witness reports and a statistical expert, and the third argument was waived because it was not raised in either the 50(a) or 50(b) motions. Supreme Court Petition for Certiorari In October 2010, Benun and his codefendants filed a petition for certiorari, asking the United States Supreme Court to review the Federal Circuit's holding that the authorized sale abroad of a patented article does not exhaust the patent holder's right to use the patent law to control the subsequent resale or use of the item sold.Benun v.

Keasler grew up in Plant City, Florida, which is 26 miles east of Tampa. He got his start in journalism with a newsletter he penned while serving in World War II. He parlayed the newsletter into a job with the Plant City Courier. From there, he moved on to the larger Tampa Tribune and then to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the St. Louis Post- Dispatch before settling in for decades at The Miami News. While at the Post- Dispatch, Keasler was one of the founders in 1956 of the Catfish Club, which eventually became the Press Club of Metropolitan St. Louis. During his 30-year career, Keasler covered both the Kennedy assassination and the 1969 moon landing. Keasler's 7,000 mostly humorous columns about South Florida life were a great favorite, some of which were collected into books. Keasler also enjoyed playing pranks on his fellow reporters, including some at the rival Miami Herald. He and cartoonist Don Wright, who won two Pulitzer Prizes while at The Miami News, in particular played tricks on one another. When the News folded, no one was more distraught than Keasler. \\"I feel half numb, like I've got a head full of cold Crisco,\\" he said at the time. \\"The News was a living thing with a heart and a soul, and it's dying.\\" Keasler′s satirical novel, Surrounded on Three Sides, first published in 1958, remains in print. He died in Plant City, Fla., in 1995, at the age of 74.

View from south-east Groundplan of Tiverton Castle and setting Tiverton Castle, detailed plan Tiverton Castle is the remains of a medieval castle dismantled after the Civil War and thereafter converted in the 17th century into a country house. It occupies a defensive position above the banks of the River Exe at Tiverton in Devon. Description Once considerably larger, Tiverton Castle now comprises a group of ruined defensive perimeter walls, towers and buildings from various periods. A Norman motte was built in 1106 and was then extended and altered in the 12th and 13th centuries. History=Civil War External view of the gatehouse, Tiverton Castle During the Civil War the Castle was a Royalist stronghold. Fairfax's Parliamentarian troops laid siege to a troop of Royalists within the Castle and set up his headquarters at Blundell's School and stationed his artillery on Skrink Hills (or \\"Shrink\\" Hills) just above him and below Cranmore Castle, about half a mile from Tiverton Castle. The Culverin, the largest artillery piece used by the New Model Army, was capable of firing up to 2,000 yards.Stuart Asquith, New Model Army 1645-60 (Opsprey Publishing ) Whilst they were still finding their range a lucky shot hit one of the chains holding up the Castle's drawbridge and a small party of roundheads were able swiftly to gain entry and thus put an end to the siege almost before it had started. The bulk of the defensive structure was then demolished by Parliamentarian troops to prevent any military re-use of the structure.Martin Dunsford, Historical Memoirs of Tiverton (Brice, Exeter, 1790) The primary source is the 1645 narrative by John Rushworth (c.1612-1690) dated \\"Tiverton, Octob. 19. 1645. at nine a clock at night\\", entitled: The taking of Tiverton, with the castle, church, and fort, by Sir Thomas Fairfax, on the Lords-day last, Octob. 19. 1645.

On Friday the 17. instant, our Generall Sir Thomas Fairfax sate downe before Tiverton-Castle and Church, to take them in, and summoned the enemy to deliver them up, of which being denied, we planted our batteries against them, which went forwards that day and the next. On Saturday Octob. 18. instant, our batteries were finished by the afternoone, and on this day being the Lord's day Octob. 19. instant, the Generall caused severall great pieces to be planted on the batteries against the Castle verie early, so that they were ready to play by breake of day, and all our Cannon began to play about seven a clocke in the morning, against the Castle, and the Enemie from thence answered us with their pieces, but did no execution upon us. And after many shot that we had made against them, a Cannonier by one shot gallantly performed this businesse, for he broke the chaine of the Draw-bridge with a bullet, which passeth over to the entrance of the Castle, which falling downe, the chaine being so broken, our Souldiers fell on without any further order from the Generall, they being loth to lose such an opportunitie, and loving rather to fight than to look on when God gives them such occasion, which took good effect, for they soone possessed themselves of all; they presently entred the Castle and Church, in which wee had foure men slaine: yet such is the mild and gentle carriage of the Generall, and his desire to spare the effusion of bloud, as much as may be, that notwithstanding they took it by storme, yet he himself gave command, that quarter should be given to all those who were alive: wee took in the castle Sir Gilbert Talbot who was Governour of the place, 20 other Officers, 200 Souldiers, four peece of Ordnance, good store of Armes and Ammunition, and abundance of treasure, which was divided amongst the Souldiers.

Descent=Redvers In 1106 the large and important manor of Tiverton was granted by King Henry I (1100–1135) to Richard de Redvers ( 1066–1107), who built the castle.Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959, p.495 His son Baldwin de Redvers (died 1155), was created 1st Earl of Devon by the Empress Matilda during The Anarchy, probably in early 1141. Mary de Redvers, called \\"de Vernon\\" probably after the place of her birth, Vernon, a daughter of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (died 1217), married as her second husband Robert de Courtenay, whose mother was Hawise de Courci (died 1219), the heiress of the feudal barony of Okehampton.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.70 The 7th Redvers Earl died in 1262, without progeny, whereupon his sister, Isabella de Forz (died 1293), (Latinised to de Fortibus) the widow of William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle, became Countess of Devon in her own right. Courtenay South-east tower, Tiverton Castle, external view Isabella de Forz died in 1293 without surviving progeny and her heir was found to be her second cousin once removed, Hugh de Courtenay (1275/6-1340),The History of Tiverton Castle, information leaflet for visitors to Tiverton Castle feudal baron of Okehampton, the great-grandson of Robert de Courtenay by Mary de Vernon. He was summoned to Parliament in 1299 as Lord Courtenay, which created him a baron by writ, although he was already a feudal baron. In 1335 he was declared to be 1st Earl of Devon, of the second creation. Tiverton Castle was the principal seat of the Courtenay Earls of Devon throughout the mediaeval period including William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon whose wife Catherine of York was during her lifetime, daughter to Edward IV, sister to Edward V, niece to Richard III, sister-in-law to Henry VII and aunt to Henry VIII. However these connections did not save Catherine's son Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon (1498–1539) from being implicated in a plot and executed in 1539 by King Henry VIII. The Courtenays also held from the 13th- century Okehampton Castle, their original seat in England, and later built Colcombe Castle, both in Devon. Russell, Seymour, Gates After the attainder and execution of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon (1498–1539) in 1539, King Henry VIII granted Tiverton to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, whom the contemporary historian John Leland stated to have been holding it, amongst his other vast possessions, in 1540.Quoted by Oman, Charles, \\"Castles\\", 1926 After the death of King Henry VIII, the manor and castle of Tiverton were granted by the infant King Edward VI (1547–1553) to his uncle and the Lord Protector of the kingdom, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c. 1500-1552), apparently the result of an exchange of lands between Russell and Seymour.Oman, Charles, \\"Castles\\", 1926 The Duke was executed in 1552 by his nephew the king, who re-granted the manor and castle to Sir Henry Gates (1515–1589),Lysons MP, gentleman usher of the privy chamber and brother of Sir John Gates, knighted at the coronation of Edward VI, whom he served as captain of the guard. Sir John was an associate of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland (1504–1553) and a supporter of the claim to the throne of his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey and thus his brother Sir Henry Gates also fell under suspicion. On the accession of Queen Mary (1553–1558) in 1553 Sir Henry Gates was tried for treason and attainted but escaped execution. Later that year of 1553 he was pardoned, but his lands were not restored to him. Restored to Courtenay Queen Mary restored Tiverton to Edward Courtenay (d.1556), the only son of the executed Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon, and created him Earl of Devon, under a new creation. On the death in 1556 of Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1527–1556) (1st Earl of the 5th creation of the Earldom of Devon granted by Queen Mary), without progeny, the manor and Castle of Tiverton devolved to his distant cousins, descended from the four sisters of his great- grandfather Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (d.1509), KG. These sisters had married into the West Country families of Arundell of Talvern, Trethurfe, Mohun and Trelawney, and thus the Courtenay estates had been divided into four parts. Some of the heirs sold their shares. Giffard Mediaeval walls of Tiverton Castle viewed from the south from the churchyard of Tiverton parish church, in which was formerly situated the \\"Courtenay Chantry\\", containing monuments to the family, destroyed in the 16th century. Courtenay armorials survive above the south porch and high up on both sides of the chancel arch One of the earliest purchasers of a share was Roger Giffard (1533-1603), who made Tiverton Castle his family home, and who was in the words of the Devonshire biographer John Prince \\"A worthy and eminent person, though it must be acknowledged the history of those actions which made him so is for the most part perished\\".Prince's \\"Worthies of Devon\\", 1811 edition, p.414 Roger Giffard was the 5th son of Sir Roger Giffard (d.1547), who was born at Halsbury, the family's ancient seat in the parish of Parkham, but who married the heiress of Brightley in the parish of Chittlehampton, Margaret Coblegh (d.1548), daughter and sole heiress of John Coblegh of Brightley, whose monumental brass can be seen in Chittlehampton Church. Margaret Coblegh brought many estates to the Giffards of Brightley, including Stowford Snape, Wollacombe Tracy (near Braunton, where her son Roger Giffard was baptised and married), Bremridge (near South Molton) and Nymet St George (George Nympton), of which she was seized at her death. John Giffard (d.1622) of Brightley, the nephew of Roger Giffard (d.1603) of Tiverton Castle, is commemorated by an effigy in Chittlehampton Church. The armorials of Giffard and Coblegh of Brightley are visible on this elaborate monument at Chittlehampton and also appear above the porch of Brightley Barton. These also appear on the mural monument in Tiverton Church to Roger Giffard (d.1603) of Tiverton Castle. The line of Giffard which remained at Halsbury still owned that estate in about 1630, according to the Devon historian Tristram Risdon who was writing at that time.Risdon, Tristram, Survey of Devon, 1810 edition, p.242 Halsbury was sold by the Giffards to the Benson family and then to the Davie's of Orleigh Court, in the adjacent parish of Buckland Brewer. In about 1800 Joseph Davie Bassett sold the estates of Halsbury and Orleigh to Edward Lee.Additional notes, p.414, in the 1810 edition of Tristram Risdon's Survey of Devon Roger Giffard (d.1603) of Tiverton Castle married Audrie Stucley, daughter of one of the Stucley baronets of Affeton Castle, on 27 January 1563 at Braunton and was one of the feoffees under the will of Peter Blundell the founder of Blundell's School in Tiverton, and to this position were subsequently elected his son George Giffard in 1617, and his grandson Roger Giffard in 1633 .Dunsford He purchased a quarter share of the manor of Tiverton, which was not incorporated as a town until 1615, and all the buildings comprising Tiverton Castle, which became known for a while as \\"Giffard's Court\\". He built the projecting tower porch situated within the courtyard in the angle where the gatehouse range meets the 17th-century north range, as evidenced by a date-stone set into the wall inscribed with the date \\"1588\\" and the initials \\"RG\\" (Roger Giffard). He lived through the devastating fire in Tiverton which broke out in the daytime of 3 April 1598 which killed 33 people, destroyed 400 houses and several chapels and destroyed merchandise valued at £150,000.Lysons, Daniel & Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol 6, Devonshire, 1822, pp.496-520 His son George Giffard, named on his monument, was baptised at Braunton on 27 September 1564, matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 11 October 1583 aged 17 and died aged 58 on 26 June 1622.Alumnae Oxoniensis His son, named by Dunsford as Roger Giffard, died without male progeny and left a daughter his sole heiress who married Roger Burgoyne (or Burgoin,\\"Burgoin\\" per Dunsford, Martin, Historical Memoirs of the Town of Tiverton, 1836 edition Esquire. In 1663 Burgoyne was elected feofee of Blundell's Charity to occupy the former position held by the Giffards. He had two sons Robert and William Burgoyne, who sold the Castle and their quarter of the manor of Tiverton to Peter West, Esquire, who made it his home and served as Sheriff of Devon in 1707. West Late 17th-century north range, the residence of the Wests, view into the castle courtyard from the SE towerPevsner, N, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.812 In about 1605 Sir Reynell Mohun sold his quarter share to Mr John West (d.1630), a Tiverton merchant, whose monument exists in Tiverton Church. The West family had also purchased the Trelawney share. It appears that the Wests lived in the Castle until it was dismantled after the Civil War, but part was later rebuilt by the Wests for their residence. Carew On the death of John West, Esquire, in 1728, his family had amassed shares amounting to 6/8ths of the original manor, and as he died without male progeny, the property passed via one of his daughters and co-heiresses, Dorothy West, to her husband Sir Thomas Carew, 4th Baronet (c. 1692-c. 1746) of Haccombe. In 1822 Lysons wrote that the then possessor of the Castle was Sir Henry Carew, 7th Baronet (1779–1830) who had increased the family's share in the manor to 7/8ths, the additional 1/8th having been purchased by Dorothy, Lady Carew from the Rev. Mr Spurway, whose family had owned it for a considerable time. The Carews had seemingly let it to the tenant of the adjoining Barton, but it was repossessed and fitted up as a residence for Lady Carew, the mother of Sir Henry Carew, and it was her home in 1822 as reported by Lysons. The remaining 1/8th. in 1822 was held by Rev. Dr. Short, Archdeacon of Cornwall, who had purchased it from Edward Colman, Esquire, Serjeant of Arms to the House of Lords, whose family lived locally at Gornhay and had held the share for more than two hundred years. Campbell Carews descendants sold Tiverton Castle in 1923 and following various changes of ownership, it was purchased in 1960 by Ivar Campbell, whose nephew Angus Campbell inherited it in 1985.

Hamilton Currey p.72ff At the time the Saadian dynasty was emerging in southern Morocco, which had been successful in repelling the Portuguese from southern Morocco, particularly from Agadir in 1541. The Saadians challenged the rule of the Moroccan dynasty of the Wattasids in northern Morocco, and tried to unify Morocco under their rule. Ottoman occupation of Tlemcen (1545) The Moroccans and Ottomans started to interact closely from around 1545. In June 1545, Hasan Pasha, son of Hayreddin Barbarossa and ruler of the Regency of Algiers, occupied the city of Tlemcen, where he set a Turkish garrison, and put pro-Ottoman Sultan Muhammad on the throne.A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period by Jamil M. Abun-Nasr p.155ff Hassan Pasha hoped to establish an alliance with the Wattasids against the Spanish. The Wattasids in turn hoped to obtain Ottoman military support against their enemies. The Saadians were the enemies of the Wattasids, but also considered the Ottomans with disdain: religiously, the Saadians were considered descendants of the Prophet, being Sherifians, whereas the Ottomans were only recent converts in comparison. Wattasid alliance with the Ottomans Things came to a head in 1545, when the Wattassid ruler of northern Morocco Sultan Ahmad was taken prisoner by his southern rivals the sharifian Sadiyans. His successor, Ali Abu Hassun, regent for Ahmad's young son Nasir al-Qasiri, decided to pledge allegiance to the Ottomans in order to obtain their support. At the same time, the Ottoman started to exert direct influence in Tlemcen from 1545, where they ousted Mansur bin Ghani, the chief of the Banu Rashid, and placed Sultan Muhammad on the Tlemcen throne instead. Mansur bin Ghani went to Spain with Count Alcaudete, the Governor of Oran, to obtain military support for a campaign against the Ottomans. In 1547, Spain mounted an expedition against Ottoman Mostaganem, and failed, but in the meantime Mansur captured Tlemcen from the Ottomans and put his brother Ahmad in place as ruler. Following the Spanish defeat, the Ottomans reconquered the area, and again put Sultan Mohammad on the throne of Tlemcen. In Morocco, the Ottomans were unable to intervene when the Saadians conquered Fez in 1549, and ousted pro-Ottoman regent Ali Abu Hassun. Ali Abu Hassun was nevertheless offered asylum in Algiers. 1551 Moroccan offensive Ottoman cannon founded in Algiers on 8 October 1581 by founder Ca'fer el-Mu'allim.

As the Ottomans were set to put Ali Abu Hassun back on the throne, the Saadians set up an offensive on the Regency of Algiers in 1551. The Saadian ruler Mohammed ash- Sheikh sent an army of 30,000 men, led by his son Muhammad al-Harran, to invade Tlemcen in 1551. They took the city easily, from which the Ottoman garrison had been removed in 1547. The Saadian army continued to the Ottoman stronghold of Mostaganem, but failed to capture the city. On this occasion, the Emir of the Banu, which had been an enemy of the Ottomans for 30 years, actually sided with the Ottomans against the Saadians, and provided troops. The Moroccan Saadian army was repulsed by the combinaison of tribal troops and Ottoman Janissaries led by Hasan Qusru. Al-Harran died of illness in Tlemcen. The last Zayyanid ruler of Tlemcen, Hasan, fled to Spain, and died there a few years later. Hasan Qusru managed to conquer Tlemcen from the Moroccans, and put an Ottoman governor and garrison in place, establishing direct Ottoman rule, and putting an end to the Zayyanid dynasty that had ruled the city. Ottoman capture of Fez (1554) In 1552 Suleiman the Magnificent attempted a diplomatic rapprochement with the Saadians, putting the blame on Hasan Pasha for the conflict, and removing him from his rule in Algiers. He was replaced by Salah Rais, who nevertheless marched on Fez and occupied the city in early 1554, when the Moroccan ruler Mohammed ash-Sheikh rejected cooperation with the Ottomans. He put Ali Abu-Hassun in place as Sultan of Fez, supported by Janissaries.A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period by Jamil M. Abun- Nasr p.157ff In September 1554 however, Mohammed ash-Sheikh managed to recapture Fez, and started negotiations with Spain to oust the Ottomans. Hasan Pasha was again named beylerbey of Algiers in June 1557, in order to continue the fight against the Moroccan ruler, who had formed an alliance with the Spanish against the Ottomans. He had Mohammed ash-Sheikh assassinated in October 1557. Ottoman invasion of Morocco (1558) Hasan Pasha invaded Morocco in early 1558, but he was stopped by the Moroccans north of Fez at the Battle of Wadi al-Laban, and had to retreat upon hearing of Spanish preparations for an offensive from Oran. He reembarked from the port of Khassasa in northern Morocco, and from there returned to Algiers to prepare a defense against the Spaniards. Mostaganem expedition (1558) The Spanish attacked the Ottomans with Saadian support in the Expedition of Mostaganem (1558), but failed . The failure of the expedition of Mostaganem ended attempts at a grand alliance between Spain and Morocco against the common Ottoman enemy.\\"the failure at Mostaganem, which brought the collapse of grandiose projects of alliance with Morocco\\" in Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the: Age of Philip II -2 by Fernand Braudel p.855 Saadian dynastic feuds and Ottoman influence Ottoman Janissaries equipped with firearms (here at the Siege of Rhodes in 1522) After the murder of Mohammed ash-Sheikh by the Ottomans in 1557 and the following struggle for power, the three younger sons of Mohammed ash-Sheikh had to flee their elder brother Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557–1574), leave Morocco and stay abroad until 1576. The three exiled brothers, Abdelmoumen, Abd al-Malik and Ahmad, the latter both future Sultans of Morocco, spent 17 years in exile Istanbul, where they received Ottoman training.The last great Muslim empires: history of the Muslim world by Frank Ronald Charles Bagley, Hans Joachim Kissling p.103 In January 1574, while in Istanbul, Abd al-Malik was saved from an epidemic by French physician Guillaume Bérard. They later became friends due to this event. When Abd al-Malik became Sultan, he asked Henry III of France that Guillaume Bérard be appointed Consul of France in Morocco.Cervantes in Algiers: a captive's tale by María Antonia Garcés, p.277 note 39 Abd al-Malik took service with the Ottomans. In 1574, Abd al-Malik participated to the Conquest of Tunis (1574) on the side of the Ottomans. He was then able to invade Morocco with the help of an Ottoman Empire force of 10,000 soldiers dispatched from Algiers in 1576, and achieve the Capture of Fez. Abd al-Malek recognized the Ottoman sultan Murad III as his Caliph, and reorganized his army on Ottoman lines and adopted Ottoman customs, but negotiated for the Ottoman troops to leave his country, in exchange for a large payment in gold.The Cambridge History of Africa by J. D. Fage p.408- In the following period he tried to revive trade with Europe and especially England, starting an Anglo-Moroccan alliance with Elizabeth I.

The combatants were the army of the deposed Moroccan Sultan Abu Abdallah Mohammed II, with his ally, the King of Portugal Sebastian I, and a large Moroccan army nominally under the new Sultan of Morocco (and uncle of Abu Abdallah Mohammed II) Abd Al-Malik I. The Christian king, Sebastian I, had planned a crusade after Abu Abdallah asked him to help recover his throne.[5] Abu Abdallah's uncle, Abd Al-Malik, had taken it from him with Ottoman support. The defeat of Portugal and attendant death of the childless Sebastian led to the end of the Aviz dynasty, and the integration of the country in the Iberian Union for 60 years under the Philippine Dynasty in a dynastic union with Spain. Later relations=Free trade agreement The Turkish- Moroccan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on 1 January 2006. The foreign trade balance between the two countries is in favor of Turkey. Except the decline in 2009 as a result of the global economic crisis, the volume of annual bilateral trade is over US$1 billion. In 2010, the trade volume increased by 22% and reached US$1.02 billion of which US$624 million is the export volume of Turkey. Turkey is the 12th export and 10th import partner of Morocco. European Union Morocco and Turkey applied for membership in 1987 of the European Coal and Steel Community. Morocco's application was turned down as it was not considered European, while Turkey's application was considered eligible on the basis of the 1963 Ankara Association Agreement, but the opinion of the Commission on the possible candidate status was by then negative. Turkey received candidate status only in 1999 to the European Union and began official membership negotiations in 2004. Currently, 11 of the 35 chapters have been opened with Turkey (with 1 already closed) Morocco has in recent years changed its geopolitical order line and developed a successful partnership within Africa. As of 2017, the Kingdom is now a full member of the African Union.

The film was based on an Edgar Wallace story, and was tightly shot, with only four name- credited actors (one of whom remains silent through most of the film) and much of the action taking place in a cramped flat and the claustrophobic confines of a car at night.John Hamilton, The British Independent Horror Film 1951-70 Hemlock Books 2013 p 98-101 Plot Cold and vicious Tony (Nesbitt) and his more pleasant natured but easily influenced partner-in-crime Frank (Faulkner) hatch a plan to rob bookmaker Joe Carter (Harry Locke) of his takings as he leaves the local dog track. They attack him brutally, then realise that the case containing the cash is chained to Joe's wrist. They bundle him unconscious into the back seat of his car and they drive around trying to figure out a way to release the case. They come up with various possible solutions, but nothing works and they end up at Frank's flat, to the horror of Frank's wife Jean (Carol White), who does not want their criminal activities to be brought to her doorstep. They manage to free the case after administering another severe beating to Joe, and decide to get rid of him by dousing him in alcohol and dumping him near the local hospital, where they assume a passer-by will find him and think he has suffered a drunken fall. As they are about to leave the scene, they realise that they have left behind incriminating fingerprints on the whisky bottle, so have no other option but to retrieve the unconscious Joe again. Not knowing what else to do, they go back to Jean's and contact a former male nurse, who after looking at Joe says he will soon be dead. As a last resort, Tony and Frank decide to dump the body outside the dog track where the robbery took place and where there will be nothing to connect the crime to them, then drive through the night to Birmingham. With Frank becoming increasingly paranoid that every vehicle behind them on the road is on their trail, they are barely out of London when Frank looks in the driving mirror, and to his terror sees the ghostly wide- open eyes of the no longer dead Joe staring reproachfully at him from the back seat. In total panic, Frank drives the car off the road and down an embankment. The crash kills Tony instantly but Frank, seriously injured but alive, is pulled clear by a passing police patrol. The police confirm Tony's death. The remorse-stricken Frank pleads with them to see if they can help the other passenger in the back seat, but the car explodes before anything more can be done.

Hours after Indian PM Narendra Modi decided to boycott the SAARC Summit in Islamabad in the wake of Uri terror attack Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have pulled out of the summit.

Reportedly, Bangladesh said that it remains steadfast in its commitment to regional co- operation but believes these can only go forward in more congenial atmosphere. Afghanistan stated that \\"Due to increased level of violence, fighting as a result of imposed terrorism on Afghanistan, President of Afghanistan with his responsibilities as Commander in Chief will be engaged and will not be able to attend the SAARC Summit.\\" Also, Bhutan has expressed concern over recent escalation of terrorism in the region, which seriously compromises environment for successful holding of the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad in Nov 2016, sources added.

Maldives on 1 October 2016 joined hands with other five nations and boycott the summit to become sixth nation to do so. India alleged Pakistan for terrorism.

Nepal is only country that have not pulled out of SAARC Summit 2016. Nepal cannot pull out of SAARC summit because present chairperson is from Nepal. Nepal, the current chair of SAARC, urged that \\"a conducive environment be created soon to ensure the participation of all member states in the 19th SAARC summit in line with the spirit of the SAARC charter\\".

It is recorded in the Book of Judges, chapters 4 and 5. Biblical account=Background The account in the Book of Judges describes a contest for control of the Jezreel Valley. Mount Tabor commands the northwest section of the Jezreel Plain, and lies at the boundary of Naphtali and Zebulon lands. The army of the king of Hazor, under the command of the mercenary general Sisera, harassed the Israelite tribes. Sisera's army was much stronger than any force the Israelites could field. Sisera was in command of a force of nine hundred iron chariots. At this time, the prophetess Deborah was judging Israel. She summoned the general Barak, telling him that God commanded him to march on Mount Tabor with an Israelite army and God promised him he would \\"deliver them\\" (the Canaanites) into Barak's \\"power\\" (). Barak was hesitant and told Deborah that he would not undertake the campaign unless she accompanied him (). The prophetess agreed to come, but scolded Barak, telling him that \\"you shall not gain the glory in the expedition on which you are setting out, for the Lord will have Sisera fall into the power of a woman.\\" () Deborah, Barak and the army gathered at Kedesh, its number rising to 10,000 warriors recruited from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.Pressler, Carolyn 2002. Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, Westminster John Knox Press, p. 15. The battle The Israelites marched to Mount Tabor. Their movements were reported to Sisera, who hastened to the Wadi Kishon, near Mount Tabor. God made the Canaanites panic and flee, and the Israelites pursued them and slain them to the last man (). Sisera left his chariot and ran for his life. Sisera reached to the tent of Yael, wife of Heber the Kenite, and she offered him shelter, as the Kenites were not at war with the Canaanites. Yael hid Sisera and gave him some milk to drink, but killed him after he fell asleep by knocking a tent peg through his temple. Thus, when Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, he found that Deborah's prophecy had been fulfilled ().

Jimmy is forced to pay Nucky a larger sum of money. Margaret is visited by Van Alden and Eli, each seeking a different side of her story as to the death of her husband.

Plot  At Big Jim Colosimo's funeral in Chicago, Capone and Torrio are questioned by reporters about Colosimo's murder. Back in Atlantic City, Nelson Van Alden, an investigator with the Bureau of Prohibition, questions Nucky about the robbery he is investigating, revealing his suspicions that Hans Schroeder was framed for the crime. At Nucky's direction, Eli visits Margaret in the hospital and delivers an envelope of cash, stressing Hans's reported involvement in criminal activities. Nucky confronts Mickey in prison, informing him that his operation is being taken over by African-American gangster Albert \\"Chalky\\" White. Jimmy buys expensive Christmas gifts for his family with part of his share of the robbery proceeds. In New York, Luciano delivers Frankie Yale to be questioned by Rothstein about his role in Colosimo's murder. Jimmy visits his mother Gillian, a showgirl, and presents her with an expensive necklace, replacing one she had sold to support the family during his childhood. When Jimmy goes to work, Nucky confronts him about the robbery. After Jimmy admits his and Capone's involvement, Nucky fires him and demands an extra $3,000 share from the proceeds. Rothstein telephones Nucky and demands $100,000 to cover his losses from the robbery, pointing out that a member of his family was among the shooting victims. Nucky refuses the demand. Van Alden visits Margaret at her home and tells her he believes her husband was not involved in the robbery, questioning her about her involvement with Nucky. Nucky visits his political mentor, \\"Commodore\\" Louis Kaestner, who derides the idea of women's suffrage. After Van Alden writes home to his wife, he takes a hair ribbon he had taken from Margaret and smells it. Margaret visits Nucky and returns the money Eli gave her. They discuss Nucky's late wife, Margaret's financial situation, and Margaret's enthusiasm for reading, which appears to impress Nucky. Jimmy steals back the necklace from his mother and resells it in order to pay Nucky back. Nucky demonstrates the change in their relationship by immediately betting, and losing, the $3,000 in a roulette game. Elsewhere, a wounded survivor of the robbery turns up at the shooting scene.  Production The episode was written by series creator and executive producer Terence Winter and directed by executive producer Tim Van Patten. This is Van Patten's first directional episode of the series. He directs later episodes, Broadway Limited, Family Limitation and the season finale, A Return to Normalcy. The story about Big Jim Colosimo's death is the one non-fictional story in The Ivory Tower. As seen in the pilot, Frankie Yale murders Jim on orders from Johnny Torrio. It was widely believed that Torrio ordered Colosimo's killing so that the gang could enter the lucrative bootlegging business.  Reception = Critical reception  IGN gave the episode a score of 8 out of 10, calling it \\"...an episode that is in some ways better than the pilot.\\" They continued by praising Buscemi's performance as Nucky by saying: \\"Here, Buscemi effortlessly switches between silver-tongued politician and two-steps-ahead gangster, and in doing so eliminates any previous doubt that Nucky is not as formidable a presence as Tony Soprano.\\"  Ratings  Ratings for \\"The Ivory Tower\\" fell to 3.329 million viewers in its original telecast.

The story features the pursuit and destruction by the protagonist Burke, an ex-con private investigator, of a pedophile ring involved in trading child pornography via telephone modems. The novel was written and published long before social concern over the use of the Internet for spreading or trading child pornography became widespread. It is the second novel in the Burke Series. The novel is also significant because it introduces numerous characters who would go on to appear in all of the Burke series: Immaculata (Max's girlfriend and later mother to Flower); rescued child prostitute Terry (who would become Mole and Michelle's son); and Wolfe, who is serving as an Assistant District Attorney when the events in this story take place. After the critical acclaim and commercial success of his first novel Flood, Vachss was contacted by Robert Gottlieb, then editor-in-chief of the New York publishing house Alfred A.

It was written by supervising producer Margaret Nagle and was directed by executive producer Tim Van Patten. Nucky makes a deal with gangster Chalky White to handle the repackaging and distribution of bootlegged whiskey. Margaret is given a job at a boutique through Nucky's connections. Agent Van Alden learns that Jimmy was involved in the shooting in the woods.

Eli attempts to smother the witness, but is interrupted by Van Alden, who uses a ruse to take the survivor into federal custody. Nucky arranges for Margaret to be hired at a dress shop, where she learns another worker was fired to make room for her. Nucky's mistress Lucy visits the shop, insulting Margaret while she assists her in trying on dresses. Van Alden tries to transport the witness to New York, but he needs medical attention en route. At a dentist's office, as the witness is dying, Van Alden tortures him until he reports Jimmy's involvement. Rothstein learns that the witness, a distant family member, has died, and sends Luciano to Atlantic City to deal with Jimmy. Elsewhere, Jimmy learns of Angela's friendship with a local photographer. He then meets with Nucky, who warns him that Van Alden is targeting him for the robbery and killings. Jimmy flees for Chicago, leaving Angela and their son. Mickey meets with his financial backers, the D'Alessio brothers, and tells them that Nucky gave away their operation. The brothers tell Mickey that he owes them the money he lost. Soon after, Chalky's driver is found hanged, as though lynched. Nucky and Eli direct Chalky to put out the cover story that the driver was killed by a jealous husband, to prevent racial tension from escalating during an election year.  Reception = Critical reception  Phil Pirrello at IGN gave the episode a positive review with an 8/10 score. He said \\"\\"Limited\\" ends with Nucky forcing Jimmy out of town, and we're left surprised that this turn happens in episode three as opposed to at the end of the season. The first three episodes burn through a lot of story on the Nucky-Jimmy front, but that's okay - sending Jimmy to Chicago to play gangster with Capone is a good thing. It will complicate things for Nucky worse than Rothstein sic-ing Luciano on him. And more Nucky drama is never a bad thing.\\" When talking about Shannon's character Van Alden he said \\"Shannon's Van Alden is one of the few characters who uses violence as a last resort, as he interrogates the suspect by putting his hand wrist-deep into the man's shotgun wound. As powerful and threatening as men like Nucky are, Van Alden emerges as a truly unique and dangerous threat; a pious federal agent who can use both the Bible and the law to justify his actions. Shannon excels in this scene, and in its follow-up: A quiet dinner at home with the wife that says very little but speaks so much about how complex and unpredictable Van Alden is.\\" Joseph Oliveto at ScreenCrave also gave the episode 8/10 and said \\"Things are heating up: The previous two episodes of this show featured excellent performances but not much plot development. Luckily, we're picking up the pace now. Characters are facing actual threats, be it from the authorities, or competing criminals. Any good gangster drama needs a constant atmosphere of danger, and now we're getting one.\\"  Ratings  Ratings for the third episode were mostly stable.

In 1137 Bernard du Bec founded a priory on the island, and it became a place of pilgrimage. On 11 February 1423, in the Hundred Years War, Tombelaine was occupied by the English as a base to attack Mont Saint-Michel. In the 16th-century French religious wars, Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, leader of the Huguenot armies, occupied the island. In 1666 the marquis de la Chastrière ordered the destruction of the island's fortifications, in case they were again used by the English. At the end of the 19th century a legend about the 'Marquis de Tombelaine' was created as part of the burgeoning tourist industry around Mont Saint-Michel.

History  The first reliable reference to the town is in 1403. In 1508, Tel Keppe was sacked by Mongols. In 1743, Tel Keppe was looted and burned by the armies of the Persian leader Nader Shah. This event took place within the context of the Siege of Mosul, in which the Persian army suffered heavy casualties and resorted to looting the surrounding towns to have some semblance of victory. In 1833, the town was once again sacked, this time by the Kurdish Governor of Rawandiz. He also sacked the nearby town of Alqosh.  Occupation by ISIL  On 6 August 2014, the town was taken over by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), along with nearby Assyrian towns Bakhdida, Bartella and Karamlish.Barack Obama Approves Airstrikes on Iraq, Airdrops Aid Upon entering the town, ISIS looted the homes, and removed the crosses and other religious objects from the churches. The Christian cemetery in the town was also later destroyed. Soon after the beginning of the Battle of Mosul Iraqi troops advanced on Tel Keppe, but the fighting continued into 2017. Iraqi forces recaptured the town from ISIL on the 19th of January 2017. By 2018 a few of the Christian residents have returned and rebuilt their churches.  Climate  Tel Keppe has a semi-arid climate (BSh) with extremely hot summers and cool, damp winters, typical to the Nineveh Plains.  Demographics  In 1768, the town had a recorded population of 2500. Due to plague and other disasters, the population was around 1,500 in 1882, rising to 2,500 again by 1891. In 1923, the population was recorded as 14,000. In 1933, the population numbered around 10,000. As a result of emigration from the town to Baghdad and the United States, the population shrunk to 7,108 by 1968. The district of Tel Keppe was approximately 50% Christian in the mid 1900s, the town of Tel Keppe remaining almost exclusively Christian with a population of 6,600 inhabitants. Throughout the late 20th century, the town experienced non-native population growth from the arrival of Sunni Arabs, who established residence outside the historic city core. By the turn of the century, the population had swelled to close to 30,000.Smith, Natalie Jill. \\"Ethnicity, Reciprocity, Reputation and Punishment: An Ethnoexperimental Study of Cooperation among the Chaldeans and Hmong of Detroit (Michigan)\\" (PhD dissertation).

Elsewhere  Tel Keppniyeh also fled to the neighboring countries of Syria and Iran. Many others also left to other countries including Sweden, America, France, other European countries and Australia.  Culture  Tel Keppe historically was the center of the Chaldean Catholic community of Iraq. Each family residing in Tel Keppe had one or more plots of farming land located outside Tel Keppe.

Founded in 1939 and incorporated as a non-profit educational organization in 1945, its mission is to facilitate music education and social development among Tucson youth ages 6 to 21. The chorus, presently numbering 150 members, sends out touring companies of 30 boys each who sing folk songs, Western ballads, Mexican songs, Christmas carols, spirituals, pop music, classical music, Broadway show tunes, and American patriotic songs. The boys also perform rope tricks. The chorus has performed in major venues around the world as well as on television and radio, and in collaboration with symphony orchestras and arts organizations. It has released albums both under its own label, TABC Records, and with Capitol Records, United Artists, and C.P. MacGregor. History The Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus was founded by Eduardo Caso in 1939. Caso, an English tenor who performed on radio, was forced to quit his professional career when diagnosed with tuberculosis; he recuperated at a sanitorium in Tucson. Caso formed the chorus in the tradition of European boys choirs, with the added flavor of the American Southwest. Originally composed of eight members, the choir was also known as \\"Caso's Singing Cowboys\\". The boys dressed in Levi's jeans, cowboy shirts, and cowboy hats, and performed songs as well as rope tricks. Caso was said to manage both the boys and their parents effectively. The chorus grew to about 30 members and began touring in the United States. After a well-received performance at the 1950 Chicago World's Fair, they toured Europe in 1955 and Australia in 1960. They appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1951 and 1955, on The George Gobel Show in 1959, and on The Bell Telephone Hour in 1966. In 1963 they sang before President Lyndon Johnson at the White House Christmas tree lighting ceremony. By 1966, the chorus had appeared in more than 2,000 concerts in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. In the mid- to late-1960s, the group was profiled in a University of Arizona film, Ambassadors in Levis: The Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus, which has been preserved by the National Film Preservation Foundation. With the appointment of Dr. Julian Ackerley as director in 1980, the chorus expanded both its membership and reach. Ackerley brought to the group a university- level education in music education, choral direction, and voice performance. The chorus began collaborating with national symphony orchestras and arts organizations, appeared on radio and television, and released numerous albums. They performed at the AmericaFest festival, the American Choral Directors Association conference, the World Symposium on Choral Music, the International Children's Choir Festival, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. They also appeared at the Kennedy Center, the Lincoln Center, the Beijing Institute of Culture, and the Sydney Opera House. A wider touring schedule saw them performing in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Africa. To mark their 50th anniversary in 1989, the chorus held an alumni reunion, banquet, and family picnic for current and former members. The chorus then embarked on a major European tour in early 1990 to the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, West Germany, and Austria. In 1991, they sang before President George H. W. Bush at another White House Christmas tree lighting event. Overseas tours, scheduled in the summer, extend up to three weeks, while U.S. concert tours run for a maximum of four weeks. The chorus performs locally in Tucson between October and May. It appears in an annual sold-out Christmas concert with the Sons of Orpheus at the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Tucson. In 2017, the chorus added three neighborhood choral groups in order to allow more boys to rehearse closer to their homes. The Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus is a member of the Arizona Choral Arts Association. Musical style The chorus' repertoire includes folk songs, Western ballads, Mexican songs, Christmas carols, spirituals, pop music, classical music, Broadway show tunes, and American patriotic songs. The singers are choreographed and are principally accompanied by staff pianist Marie Sierra. They often perform the Western standards \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\", \\"Cool Water\\", and \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\", and perform rope tricks during their Western songs. They have sung vespers and mass at St. Mark Catholic Church in Oro Valley, Arizona. Personnel The chorus was incorporated as a non-profit educational organization in 1945. Its stated mission is to facilitate both music education and social development among Tucson youth ages 6 to 21. By 1967, the chorus was composed of more than 100 members aged 8 to 16. By 2009, the group's 75th anniversary year, membership stood at 150 boys. The current structure provides five different levels for participation. Boys as young as 6 can join the Cadet Choir. All members must join the Training Chorus, which teaches boys aged 8–11 basic vocal skills. The intermediate level, called TowneSingers, performs locally in concert and for service organizations. Middle school students can join the Touring Chorus, which performs in groups of 30 nationally and internationally. A fifth level, the Tucson Arizona Young Men's Ensemble, accommodates high school and college-age young men aged 15–21 whose voices have deepened. In addition, an Alumni Group has been formed for alumni of all ages. The first boy who joined the choir in 1939 was singing in the Alumni Choir in 2009 at the age of 83. All the boys are Tucson residents. Applicants need not have great singing voices, but must be able to \\"match tonal pitch\\". The program teaches voice training and music- reading skills. Members also learn social etiquette, such as \\"how to shake hands properly, engage in conversation with adults, [and] be welcome guests when they travel\\". Members must maintain a B average in school, with no Ds. The choir has a special arrangement with Tucson public schools to allow boys who tour during the winter to make up missed schoolwork with tutors after they return. Notable members of the chorus have included John Denver, who resided in Tucson between 1949 and 1957 while his father was stationed at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base; actor George Chakiris; and former Tucson chief of police Peter Ronstadt.

As of 2012, tuition was $550 for the training chorus and $800 for the touring chorus. Parents and families of the boys raise funds for scholarships by selling discount coupon books and operating an annual Christmas tree lot. Parents also raise funds to pay for their sons' overseas tours, which run in the thousands of dollars.

She married Prince Wilhelm of Baden. The couple's son, Prince Maximilian of Baden, was Germany's last Imperial chancellor. Family and early life Eugenia. Maria's father Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg had traveled to St. Petersburg, eventually winning the hand of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, Nicholas I's eldest daughter. Maximilian was subsequently bestowed with the style Imperial Highness and given the title Prince Romanowsky. As the daughter of a Russian grand duchess, Maria (\\"Marusya\\") and her siblings (Nicholas, Eugen, Eugenia, Sergei, and George) were always treated as grand dukes and duchesses, bearing the styles Imperial Highness. After their father's death in 1852, their mother morganatically remarried to Count Grigori Stroganov two years later. As this union was kept secret from her father Emperor Nicholas I (and her brother Emperor Alexander II could not permit the union, preferring instead to feign ignorance), Grand Duchess Maria was forced into exile abroad. Alexander felt sympathy for his sister however, and paid special attention to her children from her first marriage, who lived in St. Petersburg without their mother. right 1866 assassination attempt On 4 April 1866, Maria and her brother Nicholas were accompanying their uncle Alexander in St. Petersburg, when an assassination was attempted.Radzinsky, pp. 177-79. Alexander stopped to put on an overcoat before climbing into his carriage, when a man quickly aimed a pistol at him; only the swift action of a man named Komissaroff, who knocked the man's hand up in the air, saved the emperor's life. Marriage There were various suitors for Maria's hand in marriage. Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov, a friend of Emperor Alexander II, dared to court his niece, only to be reprimanded most severely.Radzinsky, p. 185. On 11 February 1863 in the Grand Church of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, she married Prince Wilhelm of Baden. He was a younger son of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, and his wife, Princess Sophie of Sweden. Upon learning of the marriage, United States President Abraham Lincoln sent a letter to Wilhelm's elder brother Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden in which Lincoln stated: \\"I participate in the satisfaction afforded by this happy event and pray Your Royal Highness to accept my sincere congratulations upon the occasion together with the assurances of my highest consideration\\". They had two children: * Princess Marie of Baden (Baden, 26 July 1865 - Baden, 29 November 1939); married Friedrich II, Duke of Anhalt. * Prince Maximilian of Baden (Baden, 10 July 1867 - Konstanz, 6 November 1929); married Princess Marie Louise of Hanover (Gmunden am Traunsee 11 October 1879 - Schloß Salem 31 January 1948); had issue. Maximilian became heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Baden on 28 September 1907. Later life After her marriage, Maria spent most of her time in Germany, paying only rare visits to Russia. As a new wife, Maria began her duties soon after marrying, for instance representing her husband's relative Grand Duchess Louise of Baden at the christening of the Prince of Leiningen's daughter. During the Franco-Prussian War, Wilhelm served with the Prussian army under the command of Wilhelm I. On 29 July, Maria and her husband stayed with Crown Prince Frederick, and according to the prince's memoirs, \\"distracted us for the moment from the anxieties of the present\\"., p. 16. Prince Wilhelm died on 27 April 1897. After his death, Maria founded a new organization, called the German Anti-Immorality Association. Its purpose was to suppress \\"vice among the upper classes\\". Maria, with the help of Grand Duchess Eleonore of Hesse and Queen Charlotte of Württemberg, set aside a fund meant to produce pamphlets persuading both female and male royal figures that their prominent roles in society meant they should be examples of moral purity. They also sent a missive to their family and friends asking them to \\"abstain from immorality\\" for one year. Princess Maria remained widowed until her own death, on 16 February 1914 in St. Petersburg. As with the court of St. Petersburg, Maria's death cast the Berlin court into mourning, disrupting planned court festivities.

The band have released two albums, two EPs and a number of singles. History In 2005 the original band released its debut EP called “Anthems for the Disillusioned,” which contained five songs. In 2007 they released the single, “You Always Get What You Want” b/w “Play That Dirty Girl.” In January 2010 the band signed to Universal Republic Records. Their first album The Moment debuted on July 27, 2010. The physical copy became available in stores in November 2010. The band gained popularity in October 2010 after they performed their single \\"Take Me Out\\" on four iPhones on the New York City subway B train. The fictional premise of the video was that the band's instruments had been stolen, forcing them to improvise with their iPhones. In January 2011, \\"Take Me Out\\" reached #22 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. On October 28, 2010, the band made their national television debut, appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! performing \\"Take Me Out.\\" The performance included a hybrid performance of both iPhones and real instruments. The band continued the national TV circuit, performing and interviewing on CBS' \\"The Early Show,\\" \\"Rachael Ray Show,\\" \\"E! News,\\" \\"A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus,\\" and \\"Lopez Tonight.\\" On May 17, 2011, the band released a music video for “Red Light Warning Sign,” which was featured on Mashable. The video contains a controversial Facebook theme. In February 2011 the band recorded a cover of The Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me\\" for the 80's nostalgia film \\"Take Me Home Tonight,\\" the music video of which featured members of the movie cast. On September 13, 2011, Atomic Tom released an EP titled \\"In Parallel\\" featuring their new single, \\"Break My Heart Around You.\\" Atomic Tom has toured the US and Canada, sharing the stage with Ok Go, Broken Bells, Neon Trees, Ra Ra Riot, Awolnation, Manchester Orchestra, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Lupe Fiasco, Guster, and The Bravery. In the fall of 2011, Atomic Tom supported Switchfoot and Anberlin on their US co-headline tour. On October 25, 2011, Atomic Tom released a music video for their song, \\"Break My Heart Around You\\". The video chronicles the journey of a man with a paper bag over his head as he looks for love in New York City. In late 2011, the band parted ways with record label Universal Republic. On December 12, 2011, Atomic Tom released a cover of Wham!'s \\"Last Christmas.\\" The new recording was made available as a free download on their official Facebook page. A music video for the holiday single was released December 27, 2011. In March 2012, Atomic Tom performed on Rockboat, \\"the world's greatest floating music festival.\\" Rockboat XII sailed from New Orleans to Cozumel, Mexico and back. In Fall of 2012, Atomic Tom went back into the studio to begin pre- production on their follow up to \\"The Moment\\". In early 2013, the band moved to Los Angeles and began playing a few shows around the LA area to test out new material. On June 25, 2013 the band released a cover of \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" by Tears for Fears, their first studio recording since 2011's \\"Last Christmas\\". During the month of July 2013, Atomic Tom began releasing live acoustic versions of new songs, including \\"Someone To Love\\", \\"1978\\" & \\"Touch\\". These songs were filmed and recorded live at their LA home studio, \\"The Alamo\\" and were offered as a free download for fans. On July 30, 2013, Atomic Tom released their new single \\"Music Makes The Heart Grow Stronger\\" from their forthcoming record on iTunes along with a brand new lyric video for the song.

As a consequence, in conjunction with insulin administrations, the prime requirement for diabetic patients is to regularly monitor their blood glucose levels. The monitoring systems currently in general use have the drawback of below optimal number of readings, due to their reliance on a drop of fresh blood. Some continuous glucose monitors are commercially available, but suffer from the severe drawback of a short working life of the probe. The majority of these work amperometrically. As a result, there is an effort to create a sensor that relies on a different mechanism, such as via external infrared spectroscopy or via fluorescent biosensors.Pickup, J.C., et al., Fluorescence- based glucose sensors.

Theory of fluorescence Absorption and emission spectra of fluorescein Fluorescence is a property present in certain molecules, called fluorophores, in which they emit a photon shortly after absorbing one with a higher energy wavelength. To be more specific, in order for an electron in the outer orbital of a molecule to jump from a ground-state orbital to an excited state orbital, it requires a fixed amount of energy, which, in the case of chromophores (molecules that absorb light), can be acquired by absorbing a photon with an energy equal or slightly higher. This state is short-lived, and the electron returns to the ground-level orbital, losing the energy either as heat or in the case of fluorophores by emitting a photon, which, due to the loss of the difference between the energy of the absorbed photon and the excitation energy required, will have a lower energy than the absorbed photon, or, expressed in terms of wavelength, the emitted photon will have a longer wavelength. The difference between the two wavelengths is called Stokes' shift. This property can be found in quantum dots, certain lanthanides and certain organic molecules with delocalized electrons. These excited molecules have an increase in dipole momentum and in some cases can undergo internal charge rearrangement. When they possess an electron withdrawing group and an electron donating group at opposite ends of the resonance structure, they have a large shift in charge distribution across the molecule, which causes the solvent molecules to reorient to a less energetic arrangement, called solvent relaxation. By doing so, the energy of the excited state decreases, and the extent of the difference in energy depends on the polarity of the solvent surrounding the molecule. An alternative approach is to use solvatochromic dyes, which change their properties (intensity, half-life, and excitation, and emission spectra), depending on the polarity and charge of their environments. Hence, they are sometimes loosely referred to as environmentally sensitive dyes. These can be positioned on specific residues that either change their spatial arrangement due to a conformational change induced by glucose or reside in the glucose-binding pocket whereby the displacement of the water present by glucose decreases the polarity.Lakowicz, J.R., Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd ed. 2006, New York: Springer. xxvi, 954 p. An additional property of fluorescence that has found a large usage is Förster resonance energy transfer () in which the energy of the excited electron of one fluorophore, called the donor, is passed on to a nearby acceptor dye, either a dark-quencher (non-emitting chromophore) or another fluorophore, which has an excitation spectrum that overlaps with the emission spectrum of the donor dye, resulting in a reduced fluorescence. For sensing purposes, this property is, in general, used either in combination with a biomolecule, such as a protein, which undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding, changing the distance between the two labels on this protein, or in a competition assay, in which the analyte has to compete with a known concentration of a fixed labelled ligand for the labelled binding site of protein. Therefore, the between the binding site and the competing ligand decreases when the analyte concentration is increased. In general, the competing ligand in the case of glucose is dextran, a long glucose polymer attached to the scaffolding or to the enzyme. Förster resonance energy transfer Cartoon of FRET between two protein interacting protein, labelled with fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine Over the years, using a combination of rational design and screening procedures, many possible typologies of fluorescent sensors for glucose have been created with varying degrees of success. In general, these sensors rely either on or on sensitivity to polarity changes to translate the glucose concentration into fluorescent intensity. In addition to the fluorophores, these sensors contain a molecule that confers glucose specificity, usually a protein. A variety of proteins have been used for this purpose, often with different labs concentrating on one particular protein. The first glucose biosensor reported in the literature was made in 1982 by Schultz's group using a competition assay between glucose and a labelled glucose polymer for the binding site of Concanavalin A entrapped in a hollow dialysis fibre. As a result, Con A was widely used in subsequent sensors in several labs,Russell, R.J., et al., A fluorescence-based glucose biosensor using concanavalin A and dextran encapsulated in a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel. Anal Chem, 1999. 71(15): p. 3126-32. however Con A suffers from the downside of high toxicity and low reversibility. As a result, other glucose-binding proteins were and are being explored by several labs. In Biotex Inc. (Houston), McNichols and Ballastardt created a dialysis fibre-enclosed ConA sensor, which has undergone testing in animal models for several years.Dutt-Ballerstadt, R., et al., Preclinical in vivo study of a fluorescence affinity sensor for short-term continuous glucose monitoring in a small and large animal model. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2008. 10(6): p. 453-60. Amperometric biosensors, in contrast, can utilise only glucose oxidase as a protein, as it is a redox enzyme. This protein has also been used in fluorescent sensing either simply as an apoenzyme or as a holoenzyme. An exception to this group of sensors is the Biocapacitor A Sode's group, which relies on glucose dehydrogenase instead. The activity of glucose oxidase has also been used to make lifetime-based fluorescent/phosphorescent sensors, taking advantage of the fact that the protein oxidises glucose, utilizing molecular oxygen, and that oxygen quenches the fluorescence of ruthenium. This was done by Uwira and colleagues in 1984 and followed by several groups.Trettnak, W., M.J.P. Leiner, and O.S. Wolfbeis, Optical Sensors .34.

To be specific, Endo and Pasic have used this GOx-based oxygen-quenching assay to make a fibre-based sensor, whilst McShane uses GOx-based oxygen-quenching assay in microspheres made with the aim of subcutaneous injection in order to create what the group has coined a \\"smart tattoo\\", a sensor operating non- invasively by reporting across the skin, taking advantage of the fact the skin is permeable to near-infrared light. In addition, this group has created several completion assays, first using ConA (TRITC-Con A /FITC-dextran (500kDa)), but then switching to GOx apoenzyme in 2004 (TRITC-apo-GOx /FITC- dextran (500kDa)), and in 2009 testing sensors (QSY-21-apo-GOx /Alexa647- dextran) in microspheres.Chaudhary, A., et al., Evaluation of glucose- sensitive affinity-binding assay entrapped in fluorescent-dissolved core alginate microspheres. Biotechnol Bioeng, 2009. Several other groups have constructed smart tattoos and are reviewed below.Stein, E.W., et al., Microscale enzymatic optical biosensors using mass transport-limiting nanofilms. 1. Fabrication and characterization using glucose as a model analyte. Anal Chem, 2007. 79(4): p. 1339-48.Stein, E.W., S. Singh, and M.J. McShane, Microscale enzymatic optical biosensors using mass transport limiting nanofilms. 2. Response modulation by varying analyte transport properties. Anal Chem, 2008. 80(5): p. 1408-17. One particular GOx oxygen ruthenium- quenching assay was used in a study in Ingo Klimant's group, in a fully functional sensor to measure glucose levels in a healthy volunteer. The sensor was constructed by functionalizing an oxygen sensor with glucose oxidase and inserting it into the external part of a catheter used for monitoring. Apoenzymes can still bind glucose but, due to the lack of cofactors (in vitro), cannot catalyse their reaction so are less likely to get damaged. Other proteins that have been used are glucokinase from a thermophile in D'auria groupD'Auria, S., et al., A novel fluorescence competitive assay for glucose determinations by using a thermostable glucokinase from the thermophilic microorganism Bacillus stearothermophilus. Anal Biochem, 2002. 303(2): p. 138-44. and glucose-galactose-binding protein (), which is not an enzyme but a periplasmic protein involved in chemotaxis that undergoes a large conformational change. The majority of the fluorophores used for the sensors are small molecules, although some sensors have been made using quantum dots (QD) or fluorescent protein. Sensors have been made using QD as donors and a small molecule or gold nanoparticle (dark quencher) as acceptors. An example of the former is Loeb's sensil, an optic fibre system in which the quantum dot is attached to ConA whilst tetramethylrhodamine is attached to cyclodextran, which in turn is attached to the PEG diacrylate scaffold. An example of the latter is Tang with QDs-ConA-beta-CDs-AuNPs.Tang, B., et al., A new nanobiosensor for glucose with high sensitivity and selectivity in serum based on fluorescence resonance Energy transfer (FRET) between CdTe quantum dots and Au nanoparticles. Chemistry, 2008. 14(12): p. 3637-44. Fluorescent protein can be made into a fusion protein with a desired protein, circumventing the labelling steps. Shultz made a molecule with two GFP at each end. It has not been reported in the literature, but in theory it is possible to improve this by doing a directed in vitro evolution using FACS. This is not easily done by labelling, although a screening has been attempted by Pitner.Amiss, T.J., et al., Engineering and rapid selection of a low-affinity glucose/galactose- binding protein for a glucose biosensor. Protein Sci, 2007. 16(11): p. 2350-9. Fluorescence is not the only type of luminescence achievable in biological systems: Chemiluminescence, the generation of light by means of chemical reactions, is produced by some proteins, such as Aqueorin from symbiont in jellyfish and luciferase from symbiont in fireflies. These have been used to make glucose sensors: Daunert makes a -split aqueorin sensor and in 2009 Koji Sode made -luciferase with Asp459Asn (Glc not Gal).Taneoka, A., et al., The construction of a glucose-sensing luciferase. Biosens Bioelectron, 2009. 25(1): p. 76-81. In addition to small-molecule dyes, fluorescent proteins have been used: One group made a near-infrared (NIR) sensor detected by means of time-resolved/nanotomography allophycocyanin-ConA/malachite green- Dextran,Rolinski, O.J., et al., A time-resolved near-infrared fluorescence assay for glucose: opportunities for trans-dermal sensing.

In addition to protein as the glucose-binding moiety, boronic acid functionalized molecules have been used. Boronic acid binds to vicinal groups, preferably hydroxyl; therefore, it has a high affinity for carbohydrates.Lorand, J.P. and J.O. Edwards, Polyol Complexes and Structure of the Benzeneboronate Ion. Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1959. 24(6): p. 769-774. The use of the boronic acid group for the recognition of saccharide has been widely studied by Shinkai, James and their collaborators.Samankumara Sandanayake, K. R. A., James, T. D., and Shinkai, S. (1996) Pure Appl. Chem. 68(6), 1207–1212.James, T. D., Samankumara Sandanayake, K. R. A., and Shinkai, S. (1996) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 35, 1910–1922.Cooper, C. R., and James, T. D. (2000) J.

(1997) Tetrahedron 53(25), 8335–8348. To take advantage of this several approaches have been taken. One approach is by quenching, in which the system can work through the modulation of the quenching of a dye by a boronic acid functionalized viologen.Gamsey, S., et al., Continuous glucose detection using boronic acid- substituted viologens in fluorescent hydrogels: linker effects and extension to fiber optics. Langmuir, 2006. 22(21): p. 9067-74. An alternative approach is by photo-induced electron transfer (PET), a mechanism of fluorescence- quenching due to the electron-rich tertiary amino group near the fluorophore, which is affected by the change in charge of the nearby boronate group when glucose is bound. This has been used in combination with lifetime by one group.,DiCesare, N. and J.R. Lakowicz, Evaluation of two synthetic glucose probes for fluorescence-lifetime-based sensing.

Chemistry, 2008. 14(9): p. 2795-804, not only in fluorescence but as NMR agent for imaging with a Europium (3+) boronic acid dye.Ren, J., et al., Imaging the tissue distribution of glucose in livers using a PARACEST sensor. Magn Reson Med, 2008. 60(5): p. 1047-55. Environment sensing dyes Example of an environmentally sensitive dye, Badan, which having a tertiary amine and a ketone at opposite ends displays a large change in dipole momentum when excited (including an internal charge transfer), which results in turn in a significant lowering of the energy when solvent relaxation occurs The majority of the sensors adopting environmentally sensitive dyes have utilized , a transport protein that binds to D-glucose and D-galactose and transports them to the membrane-bound Trg receptor triggering the chemotaxis of the bacterium towards that glucose source.Vyas, N.K., M.N.

Clin Chem, 2002. 48(3): p. 436-72. As a consequence, several studies have been done to lower the affinity of , which otherwise would result in near-saturation of throughout the pathophysiological glucose concentrations. The binding affinity of changes when it is labelled endosterically or peristerically, so several mutants that work at range close to pathophysiological glucose have been created. contains five tryptophan residues, two of which, W183 in the binding site and W284 in the N-terminal domain (which can bind calcium), affect the autofluorescence spectra upon glucose binding.D'Auria, S., et al., Tryptophan phosphorescence studies of the D-galactose/D-glucose-binding protein from Escherichia coli provide a molecular portrait with structural and dynamics features of the protein. J Proteome Res, 2007. 6(4): p. 1306-12. Some studies with and solvatochromic dyes work not to create a sensor, but to elucidate the chemistry behind the conformational change of . Examples of this include a study utilizing L255C with acrylodan and ruthenium at the N-terminus revealing three conformational states closed and twisted, the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the tryptophan W183 under normal conditions [52], under high pressureMarabotti, A., et al., Pressure affects the structure and the dynamics of the D-galactose/D-glucose-binding protein from Escherichia coli by perturbing the C-terminal domain of the protein.

J Biochem, 2006. 139(2): p. 213-21. Sode et al. made a series of mutants of to increase the Kd in the unlabelled form near physiological range (Phe16Ala) and remove galactose specificity (Asp14Glu). The response of an environment sensitive dye attached to a specific residue of depends not only on the labelling site, which has a certain environment, but also on the nature of the dye, which interacts differently depending on its geometry. The interaction between a given dye and its environment is hard to predict in silico. As a result, in order to obtain a working sensor, several independent studies have screened a set of environmentally sensitive dyes attached to several possible sites in the binding pocket (endosteric site), near it (peristeric site) or away from it (allosteric site).Tian, Y., et al., Structure-based design of robust glucose biosensors using a Thermotoga maritima periplasmic glucose-binding protein. Protein Sci, 2007. 16(10): p. 2240-50. One advantage of is that in the wild-type there are no cysteine residues, making the introduction of this residue in a specific location ideal for labelling. A team led by Homme HellingaDespite the controversy surrounding Homme Hellinga (see Hellinga Controversy Expands) these results are not under investigation. conducted two large screens. In the first (2002) they made of a series (320 constructs) of labelled mutants of 11 bacterial periplasmic binding protein including for which they made nine mutants introducing a cysteine in a specific spot (Y10C, N15C, E93C, E149C, H152C, W183C, L255C, D257C, V296C) and tested the response when labelled with one out of eight dyes (pyrene (340, 390); acrylodan (390, 500); fluorescein (485, 520); NBD (490, 540); NBDE (490, 530); JPW4039 (485, 590); JPW4042 (470, 640); and JPW4045 (470, 640)). Out of the 72 combinations made, labelled with acrylodan in position W183C had a fivefold change and kd=5mM.de Lorimier, R.M., et al., Construction of a fluorescent biosensor family. Protein Sci, 2002. 11(11): p. 2655-75. In a subsequent study (2007), using the heat-stable from Thermotoga maritima they screened five mutants (Y13C, W14C, Y189C, S131C and M239C) with four dyes (, , Cy5 and Cy3) identifying Y13C-Cy5 conjugate, which gave a maximal increase of 50% and affinity at 15mM. A group led by Daunert used three endosteric mutants (G148C, H152C and M182C) in combination with four dyes (acrylodan, 1,5-IAEDANS, MDCC and ester) identifying M182C–MDCC, which gave a 30% change in fluorescence. A very different approach was taken by Pitner in BD, who used a single dye () attached to E149C as a starting point for a directed evolution screen, in which a mutant library is created and selected for \\"winners\\", namely mutants that meet the selection criteria. With this approach they identified E149C/A213R/L238S with kd of 10mM and an eightfold increase in fluorescence; this mutant was later used for SPR.Hsieh, H.V., et al., Direct detection of glucose by surface plasmon resonance with bacterial glucose/galactose-binding protein. Biosens Bioelectron, 2004. 19(7): p. 653-60. Independently another group (J Pickup) tested two mutants (H152C and M182C) labelled with (6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphtalene), bound to the thiol group of the cisteine introduced at site 152 (H152C mutant). This showed a threefold increase (200% change) upon saturating glucose binding, making it an ideal candidate for a sensor. Later work, adopting the mutations identified by Pitner (above), generated a -labelled mutant (H152C/A213R/L238S), with a dissociation constant in the human physiological glucose range (Km=11mM) and a twofold increase in fluorescence (100% change). Tissue autofluorescence Another pair of papers suggest that the natural fluorescence (autofluorescence) of tissues may be harnessed to track glucose concentrations. These studies took advantage of the fact that NAD(P)H, in its reduced form, is autofluorescent, and that metabolites such as glucose cause a predictable increase in NAD(P)H reduction.Evans, N.D., et al., Non-invasive glucose monitoring by NAD(P)H autofluorescence spectroscopy in fibroblasts and adipocytes: a model for skin glucose sensing. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2003. 5(5): p. 807-16.Evans, N.D., et al., Glucose-dependent changes in NAD(P)H-related fluorescence lifetime of adipocytes and fibroblasts in vitro: potential for non-invasive glucose sensing in diabetes mellitus. J Photochem Photobiol B, 2005. 80(2): p. 122-9. Sensing in vivo An alternative way of measuring the change in environment of environmental dyes is their change in lifetime, which may give better results in some sensors, using lanthanides or e.g. the aforementioned ruthenium (Ru) metal-ligand complex, either with GOx or as an acceptor of an environment sensitive dye as in the case of ANS26- in a ruthenium-coated cuvette that shows little increase in intensity but a substantial change in lifetime.Tolosa, L., et al., Glucose sensor for low-cost lifetime-based sensing using a genetically engineered protein. Anal Biochem, 1999. 267(1): p. 114-20. The construction of the fluorescent protein is only one subsystem of a clinically viable monitoring device: the sensing protein has to be immobilized and its fluorescence has to be read by a detecting subsystem that, in turn, informs the user. In the ideal situation, the detector could be implanted with the immobilized protein and queried by radio frequency, however this has currently been achieved only with amperormetric sensors.Yang, Y.L., et al., A miniaturized glucose biosensor for in vitro and in vivo studies. Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc, 2008. 2008: p. 3162-5. The general approach for fluorescent sensors is to attach the protein to one extremity of an optic fibre implanted under the skin whilst the other extremity is connected to the detection subsystem, which includes a path splitter (sliced fibre or dichroic mirror) to allow the fibre to transmit both the excitation and the emitted light, a filtered light source (in general, a laser), and a filtered photodetector (a CCD or a PMT). The information thus collected is then analysed with a computer. Smart tattoo The skin is permeable to near-infrared light (NIR). As a consequence, near-infrared dyes can be measured across the skin without the need of an optic fibre; this has been termed a \\"smart tattoo\\" by McShane who created a near-infrared oxygen quenching assay contained in microspheres. However, there is a limited amount of commercially available fluorescent dyes, and a limited amount of environmentally sensitive dyes, such as cyanine cy7. As a consequence, Pitner made a reactive Nile red dye,Sherman, D.B., et al., Synthesis of thiol- reactive, long-wavelength fluorescent phenoxazine derivatives for biosensor applications. Bioconjug Chem, 2006. 17(2): p. 387-92.Thomas, K.J., et al., A long-wavelength fluorescent glucose biosensor based on bioconjugates of galactose/glucose-binding protein and Nile Red derivatives. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2006. 8(3): p. 261-8. but to date no study with a Nile red- sensor has been conducted. Nevertheless, several studies with NIR dyes have been done. Pickup and Birch made a NIR sensor measuring both the time-resolved counts or by nanotomography of allophycocyanin-ConA/malachite green-Dextran, where allophycocyanin is a NIR fluorescent protein. In another study, the autofluorescence of NAPH, an energy carrier in cells, was assessed as an indirect indicator. A group at BioTex Inc, led by McNichols and Ballerstadt, created a NIR sensor based on ConA, with NIR dyes Alexa 647 and Alexa 750 (originally Alexa 647 & cy7) enclosed in a dialysis fibre attached to the end of an optic fibre, which they have dubbed \\"FAS\\" (fluorescent). To improve the stability they attached the protein to a sephadex, a macroporous hydrogel. Despite the change in of only 35% across the pathophysiological range (possibly 40% maximum change form no glucose to saturation), the sensor has been shown to decrease in functionality by only 20% after 450 days incubation at and to monitor glucose as well as the Medtronic/Minimed CGMS sensor in animal models (mouse, pig, and dog); however their stated aim is to create a smart tattoo.Ballerstadt, R., et al., Fiber-coupled fluorescence affinity sensor for 3-day in vivo glucose sensing. J Diabetes Sci Technol, 2007. 1(3): p. 384-93. Draper Laboratory are also developing a smart tattoo, and are currently testing on animals. The performance and the identity of the sensor have not been revealed.Nanosensor Technology at Draper Encapsulation in dialysis membranes Despite the higher benefit of smart tattoos compared to a transdermal optic fibre, no in vivo smart tattoo has yet been demonstrated, whereas fibre-based systems have been shown to be potential sensors.Han, H., et al., Clinical determination of glucose in human serum by a tomato skin biosensor. Clin Chim Acta, 2008. 395(1-2): p. 155-8.Tierney, S., S. Volden, and B.T. Stokke, Glucose sensors based on a responsive gel incorporated as a Fabry-Perot cavity on a fiber-optic readout platform. Biosens Bioelectron, 2009. 24(7): p. 2034-9. The majority of the sensors mentioned in the previous sections consisted of labelled proteins in solution. The only sensors to progress towards an implantable sensor have been either GOx–ruthenium oxygen- quenching assay sensors or competition assay sensors; to date, no environment sensitive dye-based sensors attached at the end of a fibre has been published. For fibre-based biosensors to work, the protein must be immobilized to the fibre that can either entrapped in a hollow tube made of dialysis membraneBallerstadt, R., A. Gowda, and R. McNichols, Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based near-infrared fluorescence sensor for glucose monitoring. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2004. 6(2): p. 191-200. or entrapped in a hydrogel. A hollow dialysis tube is a tube with sub-millimetre diameter whose walls are composed of porous crosslinked cellulose designed to allow small solutes through but not large biomolecules, such as protein with a cut-off ranging from 0.5-20 kDa. As a consequence, they are well suited for sensory applications, where the analyte is free to diffuse across whilst proteins cannot, both the sensor protein inside and the blood/interstitial tissue proteases. In fact, the Menarini Diagnostics' GlucoDay sensor has an improved lifetime because the injected probe uses a dialysis membrane, although it should be note that to drastically increase the diffusion rate it is coupled with a pump. Encapsulation in a hydrogel Regarding its application in fluorescent sensing of glucose, the first glucose biosensor by fluorescence, which, as mentioned, was made in 1982 by means of a competition assay for the binding site of ConA, was entrapped in a sealed microdialysis tube, in the same lab, namely of J Schultz, in 2001 another study was published using microdialysis fibres using a ConA sensor but with different labels and using sephadex instead of dextran (the former being several orders of magnitude larger). After, Dr. Ballastardt joined BioTex as a senior scientist under Dr Roger McNichols, the chief scientist, where for the past seven years they have been testing the previously mentioned FAS sensor, which used the same system in a dialysis tube. To be specific, the labelled protein was loaded with a P10 tip into a dialysis tube 200 μm wide that had been sealed with cyanoacrylate (superglue) at one end with or without an optic fibre end inserted inside. In the field of sensors of analytes, glucose sensors have been at the forefront due to the large amount of research into glucose sensors as a result of the prevalence of diabetes, nevertheless, a wide breadth of optic fibre-based biosensors, mainly using enzymes, immunoassays, nucleic acids, whole cells or biomimetic materials and relying on different detection methods (fluorescence, absorbance, chemiluminescence, and scattering), and attachment methods (coating, hydrogels, or membranes).Monk, D.J. and D.R.

The majority of these sensors, however, rely on entrapping the protein in hydrogels, as these are more sturdy and protect the protein more than a simple coating or membrane.

In the case of protein, they can work either by physically entrapping the protein having pores smaller than the proteins or by chemical linkage of the protein to the matrix. In physically entrapping gels, the protein has to be added when the gel is crosslinked, so the conditions used must not damage the protein, excluding the hydrogel, which requires non-aqueous solvents or harsh chemicals,Gupta, R. and N.K.

Hydrogels have been extensively studied, mainly in the entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified according to their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, , chondroitin sulfate, dextran and dextran sulphate, chitosan, polylysine, collagen, carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, agarose, pullulan), or synthetic (PEG, PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, PVA, PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water. An additional classification can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced radical polymerization in the case of acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides). All the various hydrogels have different advantages and disadvantage, such as biocompatibility, protein stability, toxicity, or lifetime; for example, the gelling conditions for sol-gels may damage the protein, and, as a result, several copolymers, such as chitosan, may be added (making hybrid gels)Wang, G.H. and L.M.

Fibers with hydrogel Regarding fibre-optic-based biosensors, several hydrogels have been used but mainly acrylate-based polymers and sol-gels, either by chemical or physical entrapment. In the case of acetylcholinesterase, the target of many pesticides, a sensors has been made chemically linking the enzyme to an acrylate hydrogelIssberner, J.P., et al., Combined imaging and chemical sensing of L-glutamate release from the foregut plexus of the lepidopteran, Manduca sexta. J Neurosci Methods, 2002. 120(1): p. 1-10. or physically entrapping the enzyme in solgel. An optic-fibre-based hydrogel-entrapped biosensor for glucose was made in the lab of Loeb (Liao and colleagues) and was named Sencil. this sensor was composed of a photocrosslinked diacrylate- modified PEG hydrogel containing the tetra-rhodamine (TRITC), labelled competitor betacyclodextrin and the quantum dot-labelled apoenzyme Concanavalin A. This sensor was tested only in vitro for functionality; however, some tests were done to see the compatibility of the fibre implanted transdermally in mice. In particular, the inflammation was monitored and the energy required to remove it by force was measured proving that the collagen- coated fibre required more force than to remove a hair, which has the same diameter (200μl). Another fibre-based sensor was done in Singaram lab (santa Cruz). This used a 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogel as a scaffold onto which two dyes were attached one a fluorescent anionic dye and a cationic quencher (to be specific, a viologen) functionalized with boronic acid, which assumes a negative charge when bound to glucose, making the net charge of the molecule neutral and less attracted to the fluorophore, hence modulating its intensity based on glucose concentration.Thoniyot, P., et al., Continuous glucose sensing with fluorescent thin-film hydrogels. 2. Fiber optic sensor fabrication and in vitro testing. Diabetes Technol Ther, 2006. 8(3): p. 279-87. The majority of hydrogels are attached to the fibre, one exception being the fibre optic-based sensor made by Itsubayashi's group to measure glucose in fish (health indicator), which used a dialysis membrane as the support for the hydrogel. To be more specific, it relied on a GOx oxygen- ruthenium quenching assay where the protein was mixed with AWP (azide- functionalized polyvinyl alcohol, a photocrosslinkable polymer) and cross- linked to a dialysis membrane that was rolled around a premade ruthenium oxygen probe (ocean optics) and inserted into an 18-gauge needle with eight holes on the side (akin to a recorder). In such a set-up, the integrity of the protein has no effect on the sensor, unless below a certain concentration. As a consequence, the destruction or inaccessibility of a fraction of the protein is not problematic, which is in contrast to or environmentally sensitive sensing. However, the response speed of this sensor is slow and requires a mathematical prediction to be applied to the measurement. An alternative use of boronic acid in hydrogels is seen in Stokke in Norway where the swelling of a boronate functionalized acrylamide gel due to charge change upon glucose binding is measured by a Fabry–Pérot interferometer on the other end of the fibre (note that this a different method than fluorescence and relies on scattering). An exception to the usage of placing the optic fibre transdermally is seen in the previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a premade oxygen sensor with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a microdialysis catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems. The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal optic fibre and controlled magnetically. As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen sensing probe by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials,Borisov, S.M. and I.

The junction is located between the stations of , and . Description The junction provides access from the SWML to the west and the XCR to the north. The lines cross Westerleigh Road in separate bridges, with a bridge over the old Bristol and Gloucester Railway, now a single line to a Murco depot, just to the west of the junction. The South Wales Main Line section of the junction is due to be electrified with 25 kV AC overhead lines as part of the 21st Century upgrade of the Great Western Main Line. History The junction originated in 1903, when the Great Western Railway opened the Badminton Line, the direct route of the South Wales Main Line. The junction connected the eastbound SWML to the northbound Midland Railway (now part of the XCR), which had opened in 1844 as the Bristol and Gloucester Railway. The junction provided a route from Bristol to the Midland Railway via Filton Junction, an alternative to the direct Midland Railway route through Mangotsfield. In 1908 a curve was added to the junction to connect the westbound SWML to the northbound Midland Railway.The Chronology, Doug Edwards This provided a connection from Bristol to Sharpness via Berkeley. It also gave an alternative route between Bristol and South Wales via the Severn Railway Bridge, used when the Severn Tunnel was closed. A more contentious use was that it now gave the GWR, with its running powers over the Midland to Berkeley and its own new 1906 line from Cheltenham to Birmingham, a new direct route from Bristol to Birmingham. On 1 July 1908, a new express service between Wolverhampton and Bristol was inaugurated, hauled by Flower class 4101 Aurricula. The Midland resisted this new service and claimed that the loop had only been agreed on the basis of services to Berkeley and the Severn, not northwards. Various tactics were used to disrupt competing services, including slow trains scheduled ahead of GWR expresses. The matter came to court, but in November the Court of Appeal finally ruled that the GWR did have running powers northwards. Despite this, the Midland remained disruptive. In particular they refused to allow heavier locomotives, like the new 4-6-0s, over Stonehouse ViaductStonehouse Viaduct and so this remained the preserve of the 4-4-0 Counties. The curve was removed after the Severn Railway Bridge was irreparably damaged in 1960. In 1970 the original route of the Bristol and Gloucester Railway was closed between Bristol and Westerleigh Junction, except for the short section now serving the Murco depot.

He is best known for the Faget sign—a medical sign that is the unusual combination of fever and bradycardia. The sign is an important diagnostic symptom of yellow fever. Personal life Faget was the grandson of Jean Faget and Marie-Anne Normand. His parents were refugees from Santo Domingo (Saint-Domingue). They fled Hispaniola during the Haitian Revolution and spent some time in Cuba before settling in New Orleans in 1809. Jean Charles was educated by Jesuits in New Orleans before furthering his education at Collège Rolin in Paris from 1830 to 1837. Faget was then admitted into the University of Paris' college of internal medicine and graduated magna cum laude in 1845. He returned to New Orleans and married Glady Ligeret de Chazey and became the father of thirteen children. He was the grandfather of Guy Henry Faget, and great-grandfather of Maxime Faget. Faget was one of many well-educated French physicians to practice in New Orleans at the time. They had similar backgrounds to Faget either being the children of refugees from Santo Domingo or the upheavals of the French Revolution and ensuing rule by Napoleon I. Faget's education in Paris entered him into an elite circle of physicians known as the Société Médicale de la Nouvelle-Orléans. Career His medical practice began during an era when yellow fever was a tremendous problem in New Orleans. The exact cause of yellow fever was not known at the time. Early scientists believed that it was caused by environmental problems like rotting food, weather conditions, and poor sanitation. Faget's observations of the disease prompted him to believe that the disease could be attributed to a specific microorganism. It is now known that yellow fever is a virus that is transmitted by the bite of female mosquitoes (the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and other species) and is found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa. The origin of the disease is most likely to be Africa, from where it was introduced to South America through the slave trade in the 16th century. During Faget's lifetime, yellow fever was deemed one of the most dangerous infectious diseases. Faget worked to recognize the correct diagnosis of yellow fever. The earliest accepted signs of the fever were jaundice and vomit containing blood. Faget was convinced that other fevers had the same symptoms. He sought better ways to distinguish yellow fever from other ailments. Other physicians began to notice that their patients with yellow fever shared a common symptom. Early in their illness they experience an increased pulse that was followed by a slow pulse. Faget confirmed these observations and came to the conclusion that the pulse change was unique to those with yellow fever. Faget also became convinced that yellow fever could be traced to a specific microorganism that came to New Orleans via foreign shipping. He noted that those with the fever began feeling the symptoms in areas near the New Orleans dock. He thought that the small organisms were spawned by a combination of rotting matter in ships' holds and the heat and humidity of the city. Faget also noticed a key difference between malaria and yellow fever. Malaria could be treated with quinine, but quinine had no positive effect on yellow fever. Faget published what became known as Faget's Law. He stated that \\"the pulse in yellow fever slows as the temperature (of the patient) rises or remains high.\\" Faget's sign is still an important symptom when doctors diagnose yellow fever. His findings were important at the time because they helped other doctors distinguish the differences between malaria and yellow fever. He furthered his studies in the 1860s by using a medical thermometer to gather data on patients with the diseases. He published his findings in French and English journals and stated that yellow fever was distinguished from malaria by the continuous fever that is a symptom as opposed to the fevers and chills of malaria. Faget also worked in obstetrics and became an early proponent of using anesthesia on pregnant women. He published a paper that was a study of croup and diphtheria. Faget served his community by holding a position on the New Orleans Sanitary Commission and as a member of the Louisiana Board of Health. He went back to Paris for two years after the American Civil War where he was named a chevalier, a Knight of the Legion of Honour by Napoleon III after helping relieve an epidemic in France. Faget died in New Orleans on December 7, 1884.

Medals were awarded in three disciplines for both individual and team competitions. Great Britain was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with three golds and five medals in total. They were particularly dominant in team events, taking two gold medals and a silver medal from three team events. Events Greenwich Park hosted the equestrian events. Medals were awarded in the following competitions: * Individual dressage * Team dressage * Individual jumping * Team jumping * Individual eventing * Team eventing Qualification Each event has its own qualification rules, but generally rely on FEI rankings. Dressage qualification For the team competition there was a total of 11 quota spots available. Three team spots were awarded at the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games. In addition 7 team spots were awarded at regional competitions (Europe: 3, America: 2, Asia: 2). In addition, should a country have qualified 3 athletes in the individual competition, they also qualify as a team and were allowed to compete in the team competition. For the individual competition, 50 spots were allocated as follows: 33 to the athletes who qualified from the teams above. In addition, the highest ranked rider from each of seven geographic regions qualified. The top ten riders based on FEI ranking who did not qualify otherwise were given spots as well. Jumping qualification A country may send up to four riders if it qualified for the team competition. Similar to dressage, teams of four riders were qualified at either the World Equestrian Games (WEG) or through a regional competition. The WEG awarded five spots, the regions six (America: two, Europe: two, Asia: two), and the hosts (Great Britain). For the individual competition there was a total of 75 spots allocated as follows: 45 from the above teams the rest regional or through rankings. Eventing qualification A country may send up to five riders if it qualified for the team competition. Similar to dressage, teams of five riders were qualified at either the WEG, a regional competition, or through a composite spot. The WEG awarded five spots, the regions seven (America: three, Europe: three, Middle East & Africa: one), the hosts (Great Britain). For the individual competition there was a total of 75 spots allocated as follows: 55 from the above teams, 7 through regional competitions and 13 through the world rankings. Competition format=Show jumping Five rounds are ridden to determine individual medals. Riders placing first through 60th (including ties for 60th place) advance to the second round. The top 45 riders of round 2, including ties for 45th, advance to the third round. The top 35 riders of the third round progress to the 4th round, but only up to three riders per team (so if a country has four riders in the top 35, one of those is not allowed to compete for individual medals). In the fourth round (individual final round A), the slate is wiped clean and all riders begin with zero faults. The top 20 riders in round 4 advance to round 5 (individual final round B), and ride another course. The faults for individual final round A and B and added together to determine individual medals. The team competition completes three rounds to determine medals. It runs concurrently with the individual competition (riders running over the same course) so team riders are also competing for individual medals. The first round for team competition is the round 2 course for individual medals. The top eight teams from the first team round advance to the second team round (which is the same course as the individual round 3). The scores for these eight countries over team rounds 1 and 2 are combined, and medals are awarded based on those scores. Dressage Nicola Wilson and Opposition Buzz competing in the cross- country discipline of the eventing Teams are made up of three riders, all of whom are also competing concurrently for individual medals. Additionally, countries who can not make a full team may send riders to compete for individual medals. All riders compete in the Grand Prix, which serves as the first round of both the individual and team medals. The top seven teams (included those tied for 7th) advance to the Grand Prix Special, which is a slightly more rigorous test. The combined scores for those teams in both the Grand Prix and the Special determine the team medals, with the team with the highest score winning gold. Riders completing the Grand Prix test (first qualifying round of the individual competition) may move on to the Grand Prix Special (second qualifying round for the individual competition) if their team is in the top seven (21 riders total). Additionally, the top 11 riders who do not qualify with a team may also advance to the Special to ride for individual medals. The top 18 riders from the Special move on to the third individual round, the freestyle. Each rider designs their own test for the freestyle, which must be set to music and has several compulsory movements. Riders can tailor a test to their horses' strengths, as well as incorporate movements that are more difficult than those required in the Grand Prix or the Special (such as a pirouette in piaffe) in order to increase their scores. Individual medals are assigned based on scores in the freestyle. Eventing Competitions for team and individual medals ran concurrently. Riders performed a dressage test, a cross-country round, and a jumping round. Team medals were then awarded by adding together the best three scores from a country's team, out of a maximum of five team members, from all three phases, the team with the lowest number of penalty points winning the gold. The top 25 individual scores after the first show jumping round performed a second, final, show jumping round to determine individual medals, with up to 3 riders in the individual running per team. Therefore, those competing for individual spots completed one dressage test and cross-country round, and two jumping rounds.

She first entered service for the Companhia Nacional de Navegação, often abbreviated as CNN.Principe Perfeito The first voyage of Príncipe Perfeito, which began in Lisbon to Africa with calls at nine different ports and then ended at Beira Harbour, was a run that would become her usual voyage. On July 6, 1964, the Príncipe Perfeito transported the president of the Portuguese Republic, Americo Tomas in an official trip to Mozambique. During her service years with her original owners the Principe Perfeito was generally used for passenger service or troop transport, making cruises only occasionally. During the 1960s, armed campaigns for independence in Portugal's African colonies (notably Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique) started, leading to demand for troopships as Portugal's government led by António de Oliveira Salazar attempted (unsuccessfully) to crush the insurrections. In 1974, the CNN merged with three other major shipping companies, Companhia de Navegação dos Carregadores Acoreanos, Companhia Colonial de Navegação and Empresa Insulana de Navegação to form the Companhia Portuguesa de Transportes Marítimos, or CTM. This move was made in order to streamline operations during the 1973 oil crisis and due to severe competition from airlines. Despite this major change she continued her original route.Ship History The Carnation Revolution of 1974 and the subsequent granting of independence to the colonies in 1975, Principe Perfeito was laid up at Lisbon in 1976. That April she was sold to the Panamanian company Global Transportation Incorporated, who sent her back to her builders with the intention of converting Principe Perfeito into the accommodation ship Al Hasa.

These plans never materialized and ownership of the vessel was passed on to the Sitmar Line, who renamed Fairsky with the intent of rebuilding her into a cruise ship, as they did with the SS Fairwind.SS Fairsky (3) However the company decided to build an entirely new ship (resulting in the Fairsky of 1984). With this decision Sitmar renamed her Vera in 1981. She was sold to the John Latsis company Bilinder Marine Corporation in 1982, who renamed her Marianna IX after one of his daughters. She entered a new role as an accommodation ship at Jeddah and then Rabigh. In 1984 her name was changed to Marianna 9. She was sent to Kalamata to house earthquake victims in 1986, but was later returned to Rabigh.Lost ships and great legends In 1992 she was laid up at Eleusis alongside the .

It started as a solo project in 1999 by Striid. He started to spread his \\"anti-human\\" black metal with his first demo \\"Kriich\\" in 1999, which was released by at War Records (known from their releases of Judas Iscariot, Tsjuder and Blasphemous Evil). Hermit, teamed up with founding member Striid in 2000 and they formed a band around them in 2001. In 2003 Lugubre signed to Folter Records and released their debut album, Anti Human Black Metal. Early years (1993–1999) The idea for Lugubre was first born in 1993 when Striid (at that time called Iskaroth) was inspired by the second wave of black metal and started recording a demo for his first solo project \\"Winterlord\\" which was released in 66 handmade copies. During this time he searched for musicians but it took a while to find some. When he found some musicians he changed the name Winterlord to Diabolique and they recorded their first album in 1996. After some line-up changes they recorded a second album in 1998, but it has never been released. In late 1998 he left the band for personal reasons and frustrations and started in 1999 Lugubre. Ideology In 1999 Striid started with his \\"anti-human black metal\\" campaign with lyrics about war and Satanism mixed with World destruction. Lugubre uses a warskull which stands for destruction of the human race, which comes back on every album layout or design. The skull stands for the human race and the stahlhelm for war and destruction. Present Since the release of their first album the band had some serious line-up problems which lacked in [progression of new songs and albums. Still they did gigs on a regular scale in Europe.

Early life Maria. Princess Eugenia of Leuchtenberg was born on at the Mariinskiy Palace in Saint Petersburg. She was the fourth child and third daughter of Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia. Eugenia's father, Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg, had traveled to St. Petersburg, eventually winning the hand of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, Nicholas I's eldest daughter. Maximilian was subsequently bestowed with the style Imperial Highness and given the title Prince Romanowsky. As the daughter of a Russian grand duchess and an ennobled Russian prince, Eugenia and her siblings were always treated as grand dukes and duchesses, bearing the styles Imperial Highness. Princess Eugenia (She was called Eugenie, the French form of her name, by her family)Belyakova, Honour and Fidelity , p. 64 spent her childhood in the Mariinsky Palace with her siblings. Both of her parents were interested in artistic and scientific endeavors so Eugenia received a better education than most princesses of her time. She studied music, drawing, dancing and languages. As a girl she enjoyed horse-riding. Hunting with horses and riding became hobbies she enjoyed throughout her life. After their father's death in 1852, Grand Duchess Maria morganatically remarried to Count Grigori Stroganov two years later. As this union was kept secret from her father Emperor Nicholas I (and her brother Emperor Alexander II could not permit the union, preferring instead to feign ignorance), Maria was forced into exile abroad. Alexander felt sympathy for his sister however, and paid special attention to her children from her first marriage, who lived in St. Petersburg without their mother. Due to her rank, Eugenia often served in various court functions. In 1860 for instance Eugenia accompanied Dowager Empress Alexandra Feodorovna to France, where they were greeted by Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie. In 1866, the princess, Grand Duchess Maria, and other prominent royal figures officially greeted U.S. Ambassador Cassius Clay and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox with a lavish banquet; Clay was given the honor of sitting between Eugenia and Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna.Florimond Loubat, p. 205. Clay and Fox had previously traveled to the country palace of Grand Duchess Maria, where they were officially presented to Princess Eugenia; they ate lunch together, and afterwards the two men journeyed back to St. Petersburg to carry out other visits of state. Marriage Princess Eugenia Maximilianovna and her husband Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg As a young woman, various candidates were put forth as potential husbands. One such possibility was Crown Prince Umberto of Italy. Nothing came of this however, and Umberto later married Princess Margherita of Savoy. There were also planned for Eugenia to marry then Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, the nephew of King Otto of Greece, and have him convert to Eastern Orthodoxy to reassure the Greek people, but the plans came too late to help King Otto. On 19 January 1868 at the Winter Palace, Eugenia married Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg, a son of Duke Peter Georgievich of Oldenburg. Alexander's grandfather had married Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna, daughter of Paul I of Russia, and their descendants had been raised in Russia ever since and become completely \\"Russianized\\", much like Eugenia's own family. Thus despite his German title, Duke Alexander, like his father before him, had grown up entirely in Russia, serving his military service for the czars. He was always considered a part of the Russian imperial family. The couple had one son, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg (21 November 1868 – 11 March 1924). Eugenia had a long-standing friendship with Empress Maria Feodorovna, and the two helped arrange the marriage of Eugenia's son to Marie's daughter Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna. Ramon estate Eugenia's palace in Ramon As a wedding gift, Eugenia's uncle Alexander II of Russia presented the couple the estate of Ramon, in southwestern Russia. in 1883 the couple hired architect Christopher Neysler to build Ramon Palace, a residence resembling an English castle of Gothic architecture; it was completed four years later. After marrying Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, youngest daughter of Alexander III in 1901, their only son took residence at the palace, and eventually the couple purchased an adjacent estate to build their own home. In 1902, a mob of peasants, acting out of labor unrest, attacked and set fire to the palace, causing extensive damage. Fifteen years later, the estate was confiscated by the new Bolshevik regime, and turned into a barracks, school, hospital, and housing for a nearby factory. Later life Eugenia's husband Duke Alexander of Oldenburg. Duke Alexander was one of the richest princes in Russia, not only through his landed and funded property, but also because of the great wealth Eugenia had inherited from her grandfather Nicholas I. Alexander was also second-in-line to the throne of Oldenburg, as Frederick Augustus II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg had only one young son, Hereditary Grand Duke Nikolaus; were he to die before his father, Alexander would have become heir presumptive. Throne of Bulgaria Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria abdicated on 7 September 1886, leading to various candidates being advocated by interested nearby nations; the two most concerned were Russia and Germany under the respective governments of Emperor Alexander III and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Duke Alexander was subsequently recommended, at the Russian government's suggestion, for the Bulgarian throne. Not only was he married to a Russian princess, and was himself the grandson of a Russian grand duchess, but he also held the positions of Adjutant-General to Emperor Alexander, and was the Commanding General of the Imperial Guard. In several desperate attempts to prevent Russia from gaining control of Bulgaria however, the throne was offered to candidates who lacked Russian ties, such as a prince of Denmark or even the king of Romania. In the end, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha was chosen, becoming Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. Arts and philanthropy Eugenia of Leuchtenberg with her only son Peter of Oldenburg. Eugenia was considered by contemporary sources to be the \\"most cultured and amiable women that could be met with\\", while Alexander was celebrated as a man with \\"much intellect and character\\".Vassili, p. 127. As a very popular and educated princess, Eugenia hosted a salon that was the center of literary, philosophical, scientific activity in Russia.Vassili, pp. 127-128. By 1907, she and her husband were widely known to devote \\"all their life and the greater portion of their wealth to philanthropy\\", according to one source. Their extensive donations helped fund and found technical schools, hospitals, orphanages, as well as other philanthropic institutions all over Russia. She was also instrumental in establishing the Red Cross in Russia. The Oldenburg Institute was one such organization founded by the couple; its purpose was to teach two thousand boys and girls trade and technical education, with more than half of them being lodged at the school at the prince and princess' expense. As she suffered from delicate health, Eugenia did not often venture out, instead preferring to quietly entertain in her house. While attending the opening of the St. Petersburg School of Experimental Medicine as its main benefactor in January 1907, a prominent government official, General von Launitz, was assassinated before Eugenia and her husband's eyes. The general was standing a few steps away from her husband, so that Eugenia, believing at first that Alexander had been the one killed, fell into a faint. Last years By 1914, Alexander was almost an \\"invalid\\", traveling with the help of a nurse for his care. Later that year, while driving just outside Wiesenthal in Baden with his valet and nurse, Alexander was in an auto wreck, sustaining very grave injuries. His gentleman-in-waiting and others who were traveling with the duke, either in his car or another driving behind them, were also injured in the crash, as it involved both vehicles. Alexander survived the wreck. Later in the year 1914, Alexander was chosen by Emperor Nicholas to be supreme chief of medical services to the military and naval forces of Imperial Russia. Though his selection as a royal duke was unusual to hold such a high medical-related position, there had been another precedent in another royal house, Prince Louis Ferdinand of Bavaria, who at that time was serving as surgeon general to the German army. In exile due to the Russian Revolution, Eugenia died on 4 May 1925 at Biarritz, France. Alexander would die seven years later, on 6 September 1932. Their philanthropy had become so well known, that by 1914, newspaper sources commented that of all the royal personages at St. Petersburg, \\"there [were] probably not two who are so universally beloved as the Duke and Duchess of Oldenburg\\".

The Pawnee Bill Ranch consists of 500 of the original 2000 acres, original outbuildings, a fully furnished historic home, a modern museum, and a herd of bison, Longhorn cattle, and horses. National Register of Historic Places nomination form asset #75001571 History of Blue Hawk Peak Pawnee Bill's ranch in 1911 Pawnee Bill believed strongly in the importance of the bison to the history of the American West and to the Plains Indian culture. He desired to perpetuate and develop the bison and lobbied congress to pass legislation to protect the animal.McHugh, Tom. The Time of the Buffalo. Bison Books, University of Nebraska. 1972. This was the beginning of the ranch's time as a bison preservation. The ranch is an active member of the Oklahoma Bison Association today. In December 1910, Lillie and his wife May's dream of a home on top of a hill overlooking a bend in the Black Bear River was realized. Tulsa World Article, January 31, 2010. The building of their Tudor-style Arts and Crafts home was completed after nearly a year of construction. James Hamilton, an architect from Chester, Pennsylvania, designed the home with input from Lillie and his wife. The home was a beautiful crafted residence, both comfortable and modern. Area laborers worked to construct the nearly home from native stone quarried from the Ranch grounds. Between the years of 1910 and 1926, many other buildings were added to the ranch site. Between 1910 and 1913 the carriage house, log cabin, blacksmith shop, and observation tower were added to the site by the Lillies to accommodate their growing businesses. In 1926, to meet the need for larger livestock accommodations, the Lillies built an impressive three story barn. The barn housed Pawnee Bill's herd of Scottish Shorthorn cattle. Its basement level sheltered the ranch horses while the second floor provided housing for the cattle. The top was used as storage for alfalfa and other feed crops harvested from the ranch property. On October 10, 1975, the site was included on the National Register of Historic Places under the original title of Blue Hawk Peak Ranch. Modern use Since 1962, Blue Hawk Peak has been owned by the State of Oklahoma. Now operated by the Oklahoma Historical Society, Pawnee Bill Ranch, as it is known today, is open as a historic site dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of history as it relates to Pawnee Bill and May. The site also houses exhibits on ranching, Wild West shows, and the American Indian experience in the Wild West show. In 1970, a museum was built on the site to house the Western collection as well as provide an educational experience for visitors. Open year-round, the Pawnee Bill Ranch provides educational programming for adults and children as well as a yearly re-enactment of Pawnee Bill's Historic Wild West Show. Boy Scouts of America In 1938, during the latter years of Pawnee Bill's life, he deeded the ranch property to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization for which he had a deep respect. On May 25, 1940, the Boy Scouts of America declined the offer. Oklahoma State Courts Network, Lillie's Estate, April 24, 1945. Since this time, the Pawnee Bill Ranch has been closely associated with the Boy Scouts, serving as a site for numerous Eagle Projects as well annual campouts for local and council groups.

It was developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Marvelous Entertainment, Ubisoft, and Rising Star Games. The game was directed, designed, and written by Goichi Suda, also known by his nickname Suda51. The game follows Travis Touchdown, a fan of video games and anime who wins a beam katana in an auction, from which he inadvertently becomes involved in the United Assassins Association and forced to kill assassins higher in rank to prevent other assassins from targeting him. A port of the game, titled No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 with additional content in Japan. Unlike the original, the international version of the game was published by Konami, and only the PlayStation 3 version of the game was localized in English. A sequel, No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, was released for the Wii in 2010. A spin-off title, Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, was released for the Nintendo Switch on January 18, 2019. The next mainline title, No More Heroes III, was announced at E3 2019 and is scheduled to be released in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1035543458331729920 Gameplay Throughout the game, the player controls the character Travis Touchdown. The game has a free roaming world, allowing Travis to move around on foot or on his modified scooter, the \\"Schpeltiger\\". Gameplay is open-ended, with the condition that the player must kill the top ten assassins to make the storyline progress. There are numerous part-time job side quests to earn money which can be spent on weapons, training sessions, clothes and video tapes. Money is also required to compete in a Ranking fight. Control is handled through the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment, with the Remote controlling his weapon, the beam katana, and the Nunchuk moving Travis. Most attacks are performed using the \\"A\\" button, with certain other moves, including the \\"death blow\\" and sword lock struggles, executed by following on-screen instructions. Further, since the beam katanas run on batteries, they must be charged from time to time by pressing the \\"1\\" button on the remote and shaking it. Travis's beam katana can also be upgraded and replaced throughout the game by visiting Dr. Naomi. While the katana does not follow the exact position of the remote, it is able to distinguish between a \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" position which varies the character stance and the attacks done. In addition to attacks with the beam katana Travis can kick and punch, and when enemies are stunned he can throw them with a number of professional wrestling maneuvers, done by manipulating both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Travis has a secondary mode, \\"Dark Side\\", that is accessed when three icons line up in a slot machine after a successful death blow. In this mode, Travis gains a super powerful move depending on what symbols are lined up ranging from a speed increase to outright killing every enemy on screen instantly. Plot The story follows Travis Touchdown, who is a stereotypical otaku – his motel room decorated with professional wrestling and anime collectibles – living in near poverty in the No More Heroes motel of the fictional town of Santa Destroy, California. After winning a beam katana in an internet auction, he runs out of money to buy video games and wrestling videos. After meeting with Sylvia Christel, he accepts a job to kill Helter Skelter, also known as \\"the Drifter,\\" which earns him rank 11 by the United Assassins Association, a governing body of assassins. Realizing that he has the opportunity to make it to the top, he sets out to secure himself the coveted position of number one assassin in the UAA. After killing the tenth ranked assassin, Sylvia reveals that if Travis stops killing, he'll eventually be targeted by other aspiring assassins. Travis, now convinced there's no way out, goes on to kill every other assassin except for number eight, Shinobu, whom he spares because he wants her to get stronger. During the 5th ranked battle he meets Henry, a mysterious Irish man who wields a beam katana similar to Travis' own. Before meeting the top-ranked assassin, Travis is told that the UAA was just an elaborate con set up by Sylvia, who overheard his drunken ramblings and organized his entry so that he could finally have revenge on his half-sister, Jeane, who murdered his parents. Jeane reveals in a fast- forwarded cutscene that their father had sexually abused her all her life, thus forcing her to become a prostitute to survive and become a killer. Travis is eventually saved by Shinobu and kills Jeane. The game ends with Travis being attacked by another assassin before Henry saves him, and challenges him to one last fight. It is during this fight that Henry reveals two twists: first, that he is Travis's twin brother, and second, that Sylvia is his wife (which would make her Travis' sister-in-law), and has a habit of disappearing before returning with lots of money (presumably due to conning people). Still locked in combat, the brothers discuss the nature of these revelations and their situation while they run down a long street. Finally, as the two leap towards each other for the final clash, the screen flashes and is revealed to be a painting hanging in an art gallery, where a little girl, Jeane, and her mother, Sylvia, are observing it. The Japanese version's instruction booklet, entitled the United Assassins Association Official Manual, contains a small manga which contained much of the backstory about the UAA and Travis' first kill. This manga was not included in the North American release of the game, but is available on the official website.Media  No More Heroes  Ubisoft Characters Above Travis in the UAA are ten other assassins. The person that provides ranks and sets up matches for the assassins is Sylvia Christel, a \\"mysterious\\" and \\"cold\\" woman. Travis is aided by a weapons maker named Doctor Naomi, former pro-wrestler Thunder Ryu, and a drunk, Randall Lovikov. Naomi sells beam katanas and upgrades for them, Ryu operates a gym and trains Travis – allowing him to increase his strength, combos and health for a small fee – and Lovikov is a drunken old man who teaches new maneuvers and techniques in exchange for Lovikov balls which are scattered around the city. The other ranked members of the UAA include Helter Skelter (AKA \\"The Drifter\\"), Deathmetal, Dr Peace, Shinobu, Destroyman, Holly Summers, Letz Shake, Harvey Moiseiwitsch Volodarskii, Speedbuster, Bad Girl, and Darkstar. Development No More Heroes, under its working title Project Heroes,GamesTM #50 (November 2006) was initially planned as an Xbox 360 game, until Yasuhiro Wada suggested the Wii and its unique control structure to director Goichi Suda (\\"Suda51\\"). Previously titled Heroes., Suda51 has said that No More Heroes focuses on social issues. A number of films, actors and music have inspired Suda51's design for No More Heroes. Besides the title coming from UK Punk band The Stranglers 1977 album No More Heroes, the structure of the United Assassins' Association is based on the film El Topo which features a similar, albeit smaller, ranking system. Travis Touchdown and his antics are based on Johnny Knoxville of Jackass and wrestler Josh Barnett, who also served as the persona from which the Destroyman character was created. Contrary to popular belief, Travis' weapon, the beam katana, is not based on the lightsaber from Star Wars but from the 1980s Japanese TV series Space Sheriff Gavan and 1987 film Spaceballs. Other character influences included Scarlett Johansson as the UAA's Sylvia, Ian Curtis as Travis' twin-brother Henry, Charles Bronson as assassin Dr. Peace, and Genichiro Tenryu as Travis' mentor Thunder Ryu. The city of Santa Destroy is based on San Diego, California (though, possibly mistaken, Suda implied that he used the version of San Diego shown in Dirty Harry, which takes place entirely in San Francisco, California), with the \\"No More Heroes\\" motel inspired by a similar one from the movie Memento. The Japanese cult movie Gozu provided the basis for the in-game video store \\"Beef Head\\". Two fictional anime series, \\"Glastonbury\\" and \\"Bizarre Jelly\\", that are shown within the game were influenced by Space Runaway Ideon and Pretty Cure, respectively. Suda also noted that Grasshopper Studios also worked on the anime-based video games Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked and BLOOD+: One Night Kiss, both which inspired the development of No More Heroes, considering the three together as a \\"sword action trilogy\\". In one interview Suda wanted to make No More Heroes \\"as violent, or even more violent than Manhunt 2,\\" a game that received an AO rating from the ESRB in its original form. A trailer shown at the March 2007 Game Developers Conference featured Travis Touchdown using the beam katana to decapitate or cut enemies in half, with copious amounts of blood being spilled. Later videos featured clouds of black pixels and objects resembling coins spurting from enemies instead of blood. It was later explained that the \\"black clouds\\" version would be released in Japan, while North America would receive the game with the previously seen blood. Later, however, Suda51 decided to release the bloodless version in Europe as well. The two versions both feature common enemies eventually burning away and a fountain of coins, with or without the inclusion of blood. Yūsuke Kozaki, who has previously designed characters for Speed Grapher, designed the characters for No More Heroes. Others on the team include costume designer Okama, who designed the OP for Densha Otoko, and weapons and mechanics designer Shigeto Koyama, who worked on Eureka Seven as an illustrator. On November 17, 2009, Famitsu magazine revealed that No More Heroes would receive a port to both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 from the company feelplus titled No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise. The game features new modes, revamped high-definition graphics, though it lacks motion control on the Xbox 360.No More Heroes Xbox 360, PS3 Has No More Motion Control. Kotaku.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-23. Only the Xbox 360 version is uncensored, causing Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) to label the game with its adult \\"Z\\" rating. The ports were released in Japan on April 15, 2010. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was released in North America by Konami with added PlayStation Move support, instead of Ubisoft, the game's original publisher, which had stated that they would not be publishing this version in North America. Music The song \\"Heavenly Star\\" by Genki Rockets is used in many parts of the game. In the Japanese and PAL versions, a music video of it can be watched on Travis' television, but it was replaced with the original Heroes trailer for the game in the North American (NTSC) version. The three-disc No More Heroes Original Sound Tracks, featuring 71 tracks of original compositions by Masafumi Takada and Jun Fukuda, was released in Japan on January 23, 2008. A remix soundtrack, titled No More Heroes Sound Tracks: Dark Side, was later released on March 14, 2008. The Outer Rim, a band featuring game composer Norihiko Hibino, released its self-titled debut album featuring an English drama using No More Heroes characters in a far future setting. Reception=Reviews Overall, No More Heroes received positive reviews. The game received a 34/40 from Famitsu. GameSpot gave it an Editor's Choice Award, praising the unique story, gameplay, and sense of humor. X-Play gave the game 5/5, citing \\"exceptional writing, sharp satire, satisfying game progression, unique visual style, intuitive controls, and a catchy and distinctive soundtrack. Xplay also called it the third best game and best Wii game released in the first half of 2008\\". Cheat Code Central called the game \\"a must-buy blast that out-shines all other third-party Wii titles to date.\\" The praise continued with notable gaming critic Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw, as he mentioned that he enjoyed the game for its satire, quirky aesthetic, and unpredictable story, despite the repetition and restrictive overworld. GamePro magazine also praised No More Heroes with a Game of the Month Award and Editor's Choice award, saying \\"The entries for the best new character of 2008 are closed here's your winner (Travis Touchdown)\\" and that the game \\"easily ranks among the Wii's finest titles.\\" GameTrailers, although reviewing the game positively, found its open world to be somewhat limited, an assessment shared by IGN, who went even further, claiming it ground an otherwise exciting game to a dead halt. Despite awarding the game a less positive review than others, IGN awarded it \\"Game of the Month\\" for January, calling it a \\"must- play\\" despite its flaws. Game Informer gave it one of the lowest scores, stating that \\"the repetition and lack of substance behind the flash\\" was among the many problems they had with the game. Nintendo Power gave it an 8/10No More Heroes (wii: 2008): Reviews stating that \\"No More Heroes's zany charm and zest for excess go a long way to make up for its weaknesses.\\" They also listed it as the 7th best Wii game to date. No More Heroes won multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in their 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Action Game. It was also a nominee for several other Wii-specific IGN awards, including Best Artistic Design, Best Voice Acting, and Best New IP. GameSpot awards this game for 2008 for its original IP and platform award. Daniel Wilks of Hyper commended the game for its \\"very clever writing and great combat mechanics\\". However, he criticised it for being \\"deliberately repetitive\\". Sales For the Japanese release, a poorly attended launch event for the game was held on December 6, 2007 at Akihabara's Sofmap Amusement featuring both Suda51 and Yasuhiro Wada signing copies of the games and giving away premiums. After 20 minutes passed without any purchases, a Famitsu reporter had a copy signed while others took photos. No More Heroes sold approximately 10,000 copies on its first day of release in Japan. Suda51 expressed disappointment in the Japanese sales of the game, saying that only Nintendo is doing well in regard to the Wii's success because of its adoption by casual gamers. He later retracted his comment, saying his \\"point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product which will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products which have been successful on this platform thus far.\\" By February 15, 2008, No More Heroes had sold 40,000 copies in Japan. The game saw shipments of 200,000 units in North America with about 100,000 of those units sold within the first five weeks. By January 2009, the game had sold 208,000 copies in USA.Des prévisions à la baisse pour Red Steel 2. Nintendo Difference. Retrieved on 2013-08-23. No More Heroes was expected to sell 160,000 copies in Europe. Shortly after No More Heroes's European release, PAL publisher Rising Star raved about its sales, with manager Martin Defries proclaiming, \\"We are weeping with delight. Especially as sales should improve further with the TV campaign moving up a gear from tonight. It is a verification of all the posturing and ambitious claims made these past months. I think a 'told you so' would be apt at some point. Thanks to Nintendo and the Wii console. Thanks to Mastertronic for their sales efforts and all our retail partners. Most of all thanks to Grasshopper for the greatest of products.\\" Sales for the Japanese launch of No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise were combined slightly better than with the original Wii version. The PlayStation 3 version of the game sold 16,000 units in its first week on sale in the country. Sequels and legacy A 2010 sequel named No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle has been developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Ubisoft in the U.S. on January 26, 2010 and was released in Europe for the Wii by Rising Star Games on May 28, 2010. The Japanese version was released on October 21, 2010. A spin-off sequel, Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, was first hinted at during the initial reveal of the Switch in January 2017, and fully revealed in a Nintendo Direct presentation the following August. Grasshopper Manufacture teamed with several other indie developers for the title, which sees Travis and Badman, Bad Girl's vengeful father, being transported into the demonic \\"Death Drive MK-II\\" video game console where they must fight boss battles within the games. It was released on January 18, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch and was later ported to the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on October 17, 2019. A new installment, No More Heroes III, was announced at E3 2019 to be released in 2020 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch. On September 10, 2020, director Goichi Suda announced that the game would be delayed until 2021, citing disruption to development caused by the [COVID-19 pandemic]. https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/09/sorry_folks_no_more_heroes_3_has_been_delayed_until_next_year In 2018, it was reported that Suda was in talks with Marvelous Entertainment to bring No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle to the Nintendo Switch. However, there has not been any further information about these discussions.

The Bavarians severely defeated Chasteler's soldiers in series of actions in the Austrian towns of Wörgl, Söll, and Rattenberg. Wörgl is located south of the modern-day German border on the upper Inn River. The County of Tyrol rose in revolt at the start of the War of the Fifth Coalition. The hardy mountaineers rapidly banded together in irregular units and killed, captured, or routed the area's Bavarian and French garrisons. The rebels were soon joined by Feldmarschall- Leutnant Chasteler's regular division sent from the Austrian Army of Inner Austria. In mid-May, Lefebvre advanced on the Tyrol from the north and northeast with the Bavarian VII Corps. After the Bavarians mauled Chasteler's regulars at Wörgl, the Austrian general abandoned the Tyrol and attempted to join with the retreating army in Hungary. The victory allowed the Bavarians to temporarily reoccupy Innsbruck, though not without additional fighting. The Tyrolean Rebellion, however, was far from over. Even after the regular Austrian armies met defeat at the Battle of Wagram in early July, the revolt resisted all efforts to stamp it out. The back of the rebellion was finally broken in November and only fizzed out in February 1810. Background Handed to Bavaria after Austria's humiliation in the War of the Third Coalition, the County of Tyrol's inhabitants seethed against their new overlords. Not only did the new rulers impose Bavarian law and conscription on the province, but they failed to respect Tyrolean social and religious liberties.Arnold Conquers, p 20 These tensions were fully exploited by Austria's agents, who circulated the territory in advance of the War of the Fifth Coalition. When Austria's armies invaded Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy in April 1809, the Tyrol erupted in revolt against its occupiers. The Tyrolese irregulars quickly captured or routed most of the Bavarian and French garrisons. Not only did the revolt cut off French-Allied communications between Italy and Bavaria, but it connected the Austrian armies operating in the two theaters.Arnold Crisis, p 67 Tyrolean irregulars Desiring to sustain the rebellion, Generalissimo Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen ordered his brother Archduke John of Austria to detach a regular division to support the revolt. Accordingly, John sent Chasteler from the Army of Inner Austria.Schneid, p 66 Before he arrived, the Tyroleans scored a tremendous early success at Innsbruck. For two days, the Tyrolean leader Major Martin Teimer harassed the local Bavarian garrisons with a large force of irregulars.Arnold Conquers, p 103 On 13 May, Bavarian Lieutenant General Baron Kinkel surrendered four battalions, two squadrons, and five cannons,Smith, p 285 a total of 3,860 troops. Teimer's men also trapped a column of 2,050 French conscripts. After an ineffectual defense by hard-drinking General of Division Baptiste Pierre Bisson, the entire column surrendered along with the eagle of the 3rd Line Infantry Regiment.Arnold Conquers, p 21 The main Austrian armies were forced to retreat after Emperor Napoleon I of France defeated Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller at the Battle of Landshut on 21 AprilSmith, pp 290-291 and Archduke Charles at the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April.Smith, pp 291-292 On 27 April Napoleon ordered Lefebvre's VII Corps to seize Salzburg.Petre, p 221 This was accomplished two days later, as Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic's Austrian division withdrew to the south.Petre, p 224 Kufstein fortress held out for a month. On 1 May, General-Major Stengel's brigade of Lieutenant General Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria's division attacked the Lueg Pass near Golling an der Salzach. The 1,850 Bavarians were repelled by Captain Sessich's 420 men of the Warasdin-Kreutzer Grenz infantry Regiment. Stengel lost 200 casualties while the defenders only lost 30.Smith, pp 296-297 Stengel probed the Leug Pass again on 4 and 5 May, while General-Major Raglovich (with Rechberg's brigade) moved against Abtenau, farther east. Again, the Austrians held their ground under the overall command of Jellacic, suffering 35 killed and wounded, and 70 captured. Bavarian losses were not reported.Smith, p 299 At about this time, General-Major Vincenti's brigade of Lieutenant General Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy's division suffered a minor defeat at the hands of the Tyrolean rebels. Lefebvre proposed to Napoleon that he send two battalions of reinforcements to aid Vincenti. The emperor criticized this idea and instead directed the marshal to march to the relief of Kufstein Fortress with the better part of his corps. Accordingly, Lefebvre advanced on Kufstein with Deroy and Lieutenant General Karl Philipp von Wrede's divisions, leaving the Crown Prince's division to hold Salzburg.Petre, pp 249-250 On 11 May, Deroy relieved KufsteinPetre, p 263 and its 576-man Bavarian garrison. Major D'Aicher had resisted 3,000 Tyrolean and Austrian besiegers for exactly a month.Smith, p 301 The same day, Wrede advanced southeast from Salzburg to attack 600 Tyroleans at Lofer. The Bavarians lost 22 dead and 44 wounded, while inflicting about 70 casualties on their opponents.Smith, pp 301-302 Wrede pressed on with 7,500 soldiers to Waidring where he battled General-Major Franz Fenner on 12 May. Fenner's 9th Jäger battalion, three squadrons of light horse, six guns, and 1,000 irregulars were driven off with about 100 casualties. The Bavarians lost 40 dead and wounded.Smith, p 302 Battle The Tyrol 1809 Order of Battle lists the regular units of both armies and their organization. Wörgl is located about to the southwest of Kufstein, while Söll is about east of Wörgl. Advancing through Sankt Johann in Tirol, Wrede approached the village of Söll from the east. Meanwhile, Deroy's division was in the Inn valley in the direction of Kufstein.Google Earth was used to verify distances and directions between the towns. Battle of Wörgl campaign map Chasteler attempted to stop the Bavarians with 5,000 mostly regular troops organized in 11 and one-half battalions, three and one-half squadrons, and 17 guns. This force included a tiny reinforcement from Jellacic's division, four companies of the de Vaux Infantry Regiment Nr. 45 and a half squadron of the O'Reilly Chevau-léger Regiment Nr. 3. The Austrians suffered a severe defeatEpstein, p 124 and retreated southwest up the Inn valley. During the withdrawal, there was more fighting at Rattenberg. Historian Digby Smith reported that 3,000 Austrians were killed, wounded, and captured. The Bavarians seized nine guns, 27 ammunition wagons, and three colors and \\"effectively destroyed\\" Chasteler's command. Smith listed 8,000 infantry, 1,450 cavalry, and 18 guns as engaged in the fighting under Wrede's command. Smith did not list Deroy's troops, though they were nearby. Francis Loraine Petre noted that 600 Austrians and 11 guns were captured, but did not mention killed and wounded. On 14 and 15 May, Wrede clashed with 3,000 Tyrolean Landwehr and irregulars under Josef Speckbacher at Strass im Zillertal and Schwaz. The Bavarians reported 33 dead and 158 wounded while their adversaries lost 90 dead and wounded, plus 185 captured. Lefebvre occupied Innsbruck by 20 May and optimistically reported that the uprising would soon be suppressed.Petre, p 272 Deroy's division held its own during the first and second Battles of Bergisel on 25 and 29 May.Smith, pp 312-313 However, the revolt was only temporarily repressed. Following orders from Archduke John, Chasteler withdrew the remnant of his division from the Tyrol, moving down the Drava River valley. With 4,000 to 5,000 troops, he attacked General of Division Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca's Italian division at Klagenfurt on 9 June. Chasteler was repulsed but slipped away to Maribor (Marburg an der Drau) and safety. For a short time, his march severed communications between Eugène de Beauharnais' army and northeast Italy.Epstein, pp 134-135 Chasteler briefly joined Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ignaz Gyulai's corps, but soon separated in an attempt to reach Archduke John's army.Petre, p 315 He ended the war trying without success to interfere with the siege of Győr (Raab) in Hungary.Epstein, p 143 After Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Aspern-Essling and his subsequent concentration of troops for a decisive battle, the Tyrolean revolt flared again and the rebels scored many successes in June and July.Arnold Conquers, p 180 Lefebvre reoccupied Innsbruck, but the Tyroleans beat the Bavarians in the third Battle of Bergisel on 13 August, chasing them out of the mountains again.Smith, p 331 Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon replaced Lefebvre and won a clear cut victory over the rebels in the fourth Battle of Bergisel on 1 November.Smith, p 336 Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References * Arnold, James R.

It is regarded as a minor cult film thanks to its unrelenting shabby grimness and some dated dialogue - an intellectually disabled suspect is repeatedly referred to as \\"a mental case\\", whilst another character, trying to work out why one hapless victim was selected for her grisly fate, speculates \\"perhaps she was a Jezebel.\\" Plot While making her way home from the cinema one night in a particularly grey and drab town, a young woman is murdered in an unusually brutal and sadistic manner. Local suspicion immediately falls on Hughie (Knapp), a strangely behaved and not very bright local youth who has a habit of wandering aimlessly around the town at all hours randomly collecting stray bits and pieces, with a particular fondness for broken glass - which unfortunately for Hughie happens to have been one of the weapons used in the fatal attack. Hughie lives in the lodging house run by his aunt (Dunning), along with a selection of boarders including a kindly elderly gent with a penchant for Bible-bashing (Wilfrid Brambell) and a smooth-talking ladies man (Howard Pays). Hughie is questioned by the police, but Superintendent Allen (Barr) releases him as there is no firm evidence against him. A few days later another girl is killed in the town, and the locals make up their minds that Hughie is responsible and launch a witch-hunt against him. Believing the police are failing to do their job properly, they start issuing death threats against him after gathering in the pub to discuss the case, and the front window of the lodging house is put through by a large rock. Again, Allen's instincts tell him that Hughie is basically a harmless if odd soul, and is not responsible for the killings. He starts to look more closely at other individuals connected to Hughie, in the belief that somebody is going out of their way to set him up. While the townsfolk continue their vendetta, Allen quietly observes and finds his attention focussed on a likely suspect. He shadows the individual as he walks the streets of the town one night and catches the guilty party almost in the act, narrowly saving another young woman from a murderous attack.

It is an ancient, highly conserved protein whose origin predates the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays multiple roles in vertebrate species. It is the major hypothalamic releasing factor for pituitary adrenocorticotropin secretion, and is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at other sites in the central nervous system. In non-mammalian vertebrates, CRH not only acts as a neurotransmitter and hypophysiotropin, it also acts as a potent thyrotropin-releasing factor, allowing CRH to regulate both the adrenal and thyroid axes, especially in development. Corticotropin-releasing factor binding protein (CRH-BP) is thought to play an inhibitory role in which it binds CRH and other CRH-like ligands and prevents the activation of CRH receptors 1 and 2.

Located to the north of Paris in Montmorency, the fort was part of an outer ring of fortifications built in response to improvements in the range and effectiveness of artillery since the construction of the Thiers fortifications of the 1840s. It was built between 1875 and 1879 in accordance with improved principles of fortification developed for the Séré de Rivières system. The fort defended its neighbors, the Fort de Domont and the Fort de Montlignon, as well as the town of Saint-Denis. The fort saw no action in the first or second world wars, but its prominent height made it ideal for use as a telecommunications relay station. In 1947 the French Air Force occupied the site, and by 1952 communication cables were installed to link the fort to the national air defense communications system. In 1956 the Fort de Montmorency became the national headquarters for Air Force communications. The fort was designated Base aerienne 285. Base aerienne 285 was disbanded in 1968 and the fort was first placed under the jurisdiction of 'Base aerienne 104 at Le Bourget, and later under the control of the French Air Force hardened command center at Base aerienne 921 at Taverny, at the west end of the Montmorency forest. From 1992 the fort has served as a training center for security forces associated with the Taverny center, the Centre d'Initiation aux Techniques Commandos.

The election resulted in the re-election of incumbent Democrat Marko Liias by a margin of about 9 percentage points.  Primary Election = First Challenger  Marko Liias's first challenger in the top-two primary was Republican Elizabeth Scott. Scott first publicly considered running after speaking at a Tax Day, April 15, 2009 rally in Everett, WA, where hundreds protested large government bailouts, debt, spending and taxes. On July 4, Scott announced her candidacy for 21st Legislative District State Representative, position 2. On Sunday, August 23, 2009, her expected campaign launch was reported in the Everett Herald regional newspaper. By April 2010, Scott had raised over $20,000, received many grassroots volunteers and attracted media attention for her fundraising efforts. Liias called Scott's candidacy \\"serious\\" and branded her grassroots supporters a \\"mob\\" in a fundraising email.  A Crowded Primary  When Alan Tagle entered the race as a second Republican candidate, local GOP leadership expressed unfamiliarity with Tagle and endorsed Scott, who pointed to her key endorsements from other GOP leaders. During filing week, Mike Huisman of the self-styled SeniorSide Party emerged as a fourth candidate. As of July 22, 2010, Scott had raised $43,033.17, Liias $75,052.28, Tagle $675, and Huisman $0. In the top-two primary, Scott and Liias easily advanced with 32.6 and 50.1%, respectively.  General Election  On October 7, the progressive group Open Left reported that the politically liberal advocacy group People For the American Way had given financial support to state legislators Liias and Mike Frerichs of Illinois, and singled out those state legislators to receive special attention and financial support. By October 16, Liias had raised $131,580.09 and spent $111,548.08, while Scott had raised $80,841.15 and spent $59,242.67. Seattle Gay News called the race one of the five races across the state to care about. Liias won reelection with 54% of the vote, though Scott won more votes than any Republican candidate for the district since 2000.  Attack Sites = Primary Attacks  An attack site emerged in June which accused Scott of being a \\"carpetbagger\\", \\"career union soldier\\" and \\"not a real conservative\\". Tagle accused Liias supporters of posting that site and another site which condemned Tagle for running a bikini barista. Liias denied the charge while Scott and local GOP leaders suggested that Tagle was behind the first attack site. After Scott and Liias won the primary, both attack sites were closed down.  Marko Madness  After the primary, a group called Red Snohomish PAC, led by Liias's 2008 election opponent Andrew Funk, put up a site called Marko Madness. The site, as described by the local media, > has a March-madness basketball tournament-type bracket with competition > among what it says are flaws in Liias’ personal, financial or political > background. Each week, it highlights two of those flaws. The site asks > readers to choose which of the two should advance to semi-final competition, > with the semi-final winners advancing to a final, from which one will be > selected for a campaign commercial. The form was like that of the Elite 8 bracket in March Madness. Liias responded by adding a section called \\"Curing Marko Madness\\" to his website with the comment, \\"The best cure for Marko Madness is a dose of the truth.\\" While Liias has told Scott to call for a stop to the site, Scott stated the site was unconnected to her campaign. As one local media outlet summarized, \\"Scott and Liias have each accused the other of violating a pledge to run clean campaigns based on issues.\\"  References  External links  *Liias House of Representatives homepage *Liias Campaign website *Scott Campaign Website *Bio of Elizabeth Scott *Scott Campaign YouTube Channel Category:2010 Washington (state) elections Category:Washington State Legislature elections ","title":"2010 Washington's 21st Legislative District, House 2 election"},{"id":"29223112","text":"Dog is the third studio album by Sow released in 2010.

He was also one of the founders of The Hindu.  Early life  Pantulu was born in a Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family in Nellore on 14 January 1856, but later moved to Rajahmundry. His father Veera Raghava Rao worked in the Customs Department (Salt Branch) in the Madras Government. His mother was Rangamma. As a student, Subba Rao was known for his intelligence and industry. After passing the Matriculation examination, he joined the Christian College at Madras and obtained his B.A degree in 1876. Three years later, he obtained his Law degree. After qualifying for the Bar, he set up his practice at Rajahmundry in 1880. At Rajahmundry, he came into contact with Kandukuri Veeresalingam Kandukuri Veeresalingam, the well known Andhra social reformer. Subba Rao was attracted by the literary and social reform activities of Veeresalingam. Within a few years Subba Rao became a leading lawyer in Rajahmundry.  Literary Interests  Subba Rao was interested in journalism and Telugu literature. While studying in Madras, he founded The Hindu in 1878 along with his friends G. Subramania Iyer and M. Veeraraghavachariar. He also founded two other journals : Chintamani in Telugu and Indian Progress in English. Chintamani encouraged the writing of Telugu novels by instituting annual awards.  Political Activities  Pantulu was involved in politics from his early life. He served as the first Chairman of the Rajahmundry municipality. He attended the first session of the Indian National Congress held at Bombay in 1885. In 1892, he was elected as a member of the Madras Legislative Council. In 1894, he presided over the annual session of the Krishna District Association. In the following year he established the Godavari District Association. He presided over the annual session of the Madras Provincial Conference held at Visakhapatnam on 5 June 1907.  Indian Independence Movement  Subbarao was a moderate by conviction. He did not support the activists of the extremists. At the same time, he supported the Swadeshi Movement as it fostered the growth of indigenous industries. Along with C.Y. Chintamani he toured the coastal Andhra districts to propagate Swadeshi. Pantulu was elected as the General Secretary of the Indian National Congress in 1914 and remained in that position till 1917. When the Andhra Mahasabha held its second session at Vijayawada on 11 April 1914, Pantulu presided over the meeting in which he demanded a separate Andhra state for Telugu-speaking people of Madras Presidency. This resulted in the formation of the Andhra Congress Council on 22 January 1918 with Pantulu as its first President and Konda Venkatappaiah as its Secretary.  Death  Pantulu died in late 1940 at the age of 84. In a tribute which appeared in The Hindu in January 1941, Pantulu was hailed as \\"a man of magnificent vitality\\" and \\"a promoter of 'liberal Hinduism'\\".

Inaugurated in 1889, plant was the first major hydroelectric power plant constructed in South America, specifically for public use. It was purchased by CEMIG in 1980 and now serves as a museum. The Marmelos IA and II downstream are still in operation and are serviced by the original dam. History Bernardo Mascarenhas (1846-1899) became a resident of Juiz de Fora and as an adult became interested in providing electricity for the city. In 1886, Mascarenhas and banker Francisco Batista de Oliveira received approval from the city to use the Marmelos Falls for electric production and they subsequently incorporated the Minas Electricity Company. In February 1889, construction on the power plant began and by August, it began to produce initial electricity. The plant was inaugurated on September 5, 1889. The power plant was supported by a long and high dam which diverts water into a canal on the river's southern bank that supplies the power station downstream. At first, the power plant utilized two generators which operated single-phase alternators at a frequency of 60 hertz. In the next year, the plant powered 180 light-bulbs. In the following years, a third generator was added to the plant and it powered over 700 light-bulbs and contributed to industrial and public use in the city. By 1896, the power plant was decommissioned as new and improved plants such as the Marmelos I, IA and II were built that could better utilize the Marmelos Falls. Marmelos I is also decommissioned while IA and II continue operations with a capacity of . In 1980, CEMIG purchased the power plant and renovated it. It became licensed as a museum in 1983 and as of 2000 it is maintained by Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora under an agreement with CEMIG.

Officially formed in 2005, the band tours nationwide and appears regularly on the summer music festival circuit. Currently, the group is composed of guitarists Jeff Lloyd and Mike Garulli, keyboardist Jim Wuest, bassist Tony D'Amato, and drummer Jamie Newitt. In 2010 they released their second studio LP The Heavy Pets. The album was dubbed a \\"Top 10 Album of 2010\\" by The Huffington Post.  Early years Original members Jeff Lloyd, Mike Garulli, Jesse Margiotta, and Joe Dupell befriended each other at Goshen Central High School in upstate Goshen, New York. Garulli was in a hardcore band named Strep Nine when he met Lloyd. Together the quartet formed Anthem, the first iteration of their band loosely named after the 1938 Anthem Ayn Rand novella because they were still interested in Rush. The group practiced under several more names (such as My Friends Band) before sticking with The Heavy Pets, only to fizzle apart when members left for college. While at Syracuse University Lloyd befriended classmate and keyboardist Jim Wuest. Lloyd and Wuest played regular gigs together with bassist Robert \\"Chops\\" Froehlich and Syracuse University drummer Kinyatta King under the name My Friends Band, but the group disbanded after 2003. The high school crew partially regrouped after college, but remained a completely underground band. In 2004 Lloyd got a call from former Heavy Pets bassist Joe Dupell, who had moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to start an internet marketing company. Dupell invited him to visit, and Lloyd saw it as an opportunity to leave New York. Garulli followed, and The Heavy Pets were officially formed. Wuest arrived soon after. Lloyd had his first Florida debut jamming with George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic on New Years between 2004 and 2005. Their first South Florida show was late in 2005, on a patio in a Broward County, Florida condominium just after Hurricane Wilma. Afterwards the band recorded a demo and began booking at Florida venues such as Fat Cats, Alligator Alley, and Tobacco Road, Miami. By April 2006, they had already played over 350 gigs and shared the stage with Bernie Worrell, Oteil Burbridge and the Peacemakers, and Tea Leaf Green. The lineup changed several times after the release of Whale, with drummer Jamie Newitt joining the group just before 2008 Langerado Music Festival, right before a heavy summer touring schedule. Dupell left the band suddenly in late 2008, and bassists Mark White of the Spin Doctors and Felix Pastorious (son of Jaco Pastorius) began moonlighting at shows. Philadelphia bassist Justin Carney joined the group as Dupell's permanent replacement in mid-2009. He left the band in the summer of 2012, and was replaced by Tony D'Amato, a longtime musical collaborator and high school friend of Newitt.  Big breaks  Langerado 2006 The band's breakthrough came in March 2006. They were selected by popular local vote out of 350 other local unsigned bands to perform at the 2006 Langerado Music Festival. While there they played along bands such as Ben Harper, The Flaming Lips, G Love, and Robert Randolph. High Times That May they were selected as the High Times \\"Unsigned Band of the Week\\". In July 2006 the band embarked on an East Coast festival tour, hitting as far as upstate New York. That September they also performed at the Symbiosis Gathering in Angel's Camp, CA. Jam Cruise The Heavy Pets were invited to perform on Jam Cruise, specifically the annual music-festival-at-sea's 10th voyage in January 2012. The Heavy Pets donated a portion of proceeds from Swim Out Past The Sun sales between its release and the band's inaugural voyage upon Jam Cruise in support of Positive Legacy's community outreach projects in Haiti. Album history=Whale (March 2007) In March 2007 the band released their first studio effort Whale. The album was recorded from September 2005 to March 2007 at Dreamfactory Studios in Boynton Beach, Florida. It featured the original line up, with Ryan Neuburger on drums and Joe Dupell on bass. The double-disc debut has 21 tracks ranging from rock, to reggae, to folk. The hit tracks \\"Operation of Flight\\" and \\"Sleep\\" were rotated heavily on Sirius Jam-On, earning the band \\"most- played\\" status for an unsigned act. They toured heavily in Florida to promote the album in the fall of 2007. Slow Motion Conductor (March 2008) In 2008 they released a three track EP entitled Slow Motion Conductor. The Heavy Pets (April 2010)  In 2010 the band signed with the label and management team 102° and traveled to Marin County, California to record a new album. That winter they spent six weeks recording the album in Scott Mathews' TikiTown studio. The band had self-produced everything up to that point, but Mathews produced the album. As a Multi-Platinum award winner, some of Matthews' previous projects have included Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton, Joey Ramone, Elvis Costello, Van Morrison, Steve Perry, Ry Cooder and Neil Young. It was mastered by Grammy Award winner Vlado Meller of Universal Mastering Studios NYC, and released on both CD and vinyl. Tom Lueken served as engineer. John Popper of Blues Traveler made a guest appearance on the track \\"Girl You Make Me Stupid\\" with a harmonica solo. An old college friend of Wuest and Lloyd, Mike Kammers, arranged horns. Swim Out Past The Sun (October 2011) The band returned to their acoustic roots on Swim Out Past The Sun. Featuring a three song sit-in by longtime Jerry Garcia collaborator David Grisman, Swim Out Past The Sun was again produced by Scott Mathews and mastered by Vlado Meller. Its cover art was contributed by American painter Mark T. Smith. Two Horses (October 2013) The release of Two Horses marked a new era in The Heavy Pets' process of recording their prolific song catalog. By utilizing the world-class, hometown Power Station Recording Studios, the band was able to self-produce \\"Last Babies\\" and \\"Keep Me Running\\" while maintaining their rigorous performance schedules. Two Horses was recorded and mixed by Paul Kronk at Power Station Recording Studios, mastered by Paul Gold at Salt Mastering, produced by The Heavy Pets and executive produced by Brotherly Love Productions. The two tracks are in rotation on Sirius XM Jam-On. Rags And Aces (May 2014) Rags and Aces, the second in a series of self-produced EPs The Heavy Pets have been working on amidst their rigorous tour schedule. Following the success of their first in the series, Two Horses, the Pets stuck to the same formula of tracking and mixing close to home at South Florida's Power Station Recording Studios. Although the Pets attribute the writing credits of every song to the band as a whole, the three-track recording features one penned by each of the band's principle songwriters. Mike Garulli's \\"Movie Star\\" debuted live as a bluegrass/Americana number before getting shelved, reworked and recorded as a catchy indie pop tune with an abundance of witty lyricism. Jim Wuest's double- headed \\"Dewpoint\\" commemorates a friend's success in a poker tournament and kicks off with a serious funk groove paralleling the ups-and-downs of the game before taking off into a celebratory disco dance party. Jeff Lloyd's \\"Chew\\" depicts a long night of indulgence that can only be set at a music festival. Stolen Smile (November 2014) Stolen Smile, the third in a series of self-produced EPs with tracking and mixing completed at South Florida's Power Station Recording Studios on the release which again showcases the work from multiple THP contributors. The two-track recording features another fresh tune penned by Mike Garulli in the down-tempo atmospheric \\"Giant Birds,\\" first heard live in the Fall of 2013 while \\"Sigismondi\\" is another of Jim Wuest's dynamic dance numbers which has matured over a longer road life but developed into the unique sonic journey captured in a fresh light for this release. Touring A longtime fixture on the summer festival scene, The Heavy Pets have taken the stage at Bonnaroo, Jam Cruise, High Sierra Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, moe.down, Langerado, Summer Camp Music Festival, All Good Music Festival, Wakarusa Music Festival, Wanee Festival, The Peach Music Festival, Hulaween, Bear Creek, Mountain Jam Festival and their namesake PetZoo. They tour nationwide and have played over 1000 shows since their late 2005 inception.

Located to the north of Paris in Domont, the fort was part of an outer ring of fortifications built in response to improvements in the range and effectiveness of artillery since the construction of the Thiers fortifications of the 1840s. It was built between 1875 and 1879 in accordance with improved principles of fortification developed for the Séré de Rivières system. Work on the fort began in 1874 and were completed in 1878. The fort covered an area of and its garrison comprised 1175 men and officers. The fort's artillery fire supported its neighbors, the Fort de Montmorency and the Fort de Montlignon. The pentagonal fort was entered through the south side, facing Paris. It featured a double caponier on the point facing outward, and two flanking caponiers on the east and west sides. The fort's main armament was a 155mm Mougin turret, added in 1884. Other artillery on the firing terrace, or cavalier, was of 120mm and 95mm caliber. The fort's artillery dominated the plains to the north, as well as the railway line to Pontoise. On 3 and 4 September 1914, the fort fired on German scout parties in the vicinity of Luzarches, the only Parisian fortification to fire on Germans during World War I. The fort was occupied by German forces during World War II, who blew up the fort's ammunition stockpile before evacuating on 26 August 1944. The fort was used by the French Post (PTT) as an ionospheric research station during the 1950s, followed by the Ministry of Agriculture.

At the age of 87 he was still teaching law. He also served as a close advisor to long-time UPR Chancellor and President Jaime Benítez. Helfeld, who does not practice law, serves as an arbitrator and a Special Master appointed by the federal district court in Puerto Rico regarding a mental health class action against the Government of Puerto Rico. Personal life A resident of Puerto Rico, he was married to the late Raquel Armenteros Vázquez, a co-founder of Puerto Rico's League of Women Voters, and has several sons, including Jan, an attorney,http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,595982,00.html Stephen and Peter. Professional career Helfeld was recruited by Chancellor Benítez to replace Dr. Raúl Serrano Geyls, who resigned as law professor to pursue a career in private practice that would eventually lead to appointment as an Associate Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. He began teaching Administrative Law and Labor Law, after being blacklisted as a result of a scathing attack by Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover, who accused Helfeld of being a communist. The attack was triggered for having co-authored as a graduate fellow at Yale University an article criticizing civil rights policies in the early days of what would come to be known as McCarthyism. After being recruited at UPR, Helfeld completed his post-graduate studies, obtaining an SJD degree at Yale Law School in 1954. When former Franklin D. Roosevelt Brain Trust member and former Governor Rexford Guy Tugwell returned to UPR, Helfeld met with him and helped him draft a new United States Constitution, which Tugwell wished to propose but which even Helfeld considered impossible to enact. He was appointed Dean of the School of Law in 1960, succeeding professor Manuel Rodríguez Ramos, a position he held for over 13 years until 1974. During his term as Dean, he supervised the design, by architect Henry Klumb, and construction of the new Law School building and recruited a varied, internationally diverse faculty. After resigning as Dean, he remained on the faculty until 1977, when he retired, and taught at the Pontifical Catholic University School of Law in Ponce from 1977 until 1987, when he returned to UPR on a part-time basis.

The primary operator on the line is the Twin Cities and Western Railroad which has trackage rights on the entire line and uses it to run trains from their main line to BNSF Railway's Wayzata Subdivision. The Bass Lake Spur had been part of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the Milwaukee Road). A parallel line built by the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway followed the Bass Lake line very closely from Minneapolis to Hopkins, where the two lines deviated. The M&StL; line ran somewhat farther north than the Milwaukee Road, but dived southward farther west. The two lines crossed at Tower E-14 in Minnetonka, which is where the Bass Lake Spur ends today and becomes the Twin Cities and Western Railroad's Glencoe Subdivision. In the east, the line formerly continued through Minneapolis in the 29th Street grade separation, now known as the Midtown Greenway. That line carried rails to the Short Line connecting Minneapolis to neighboring Saint Paul. However, the route was severed in the 1990s when Hiawatha Avenue was reconstructed. A temporary link was built between the Bass Lake line and the BNSF Railway along the Kenilworth Trail, a former Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway right-of-way. However, this link was only meant to last between one and six years. As of 2010, it has been in place for over a decade. } An improved junction with CP's MN&S; Spur has been planned since 1999. While there is an existing connection, it doesn't allow for continuous moves from one line to the other. Interest in building the junction has been reignited as the Southwest Corridor light rail line has moved toward implementation. The Southwest Corridor will use the Bass Lake Spur's current right-of-way along the Kenilworth Trail, so a new way of moving trains off of the Twin Cities and Western's main line into the rest of the Twin Cities rail system is necessary.

The CCAP is the largest Protestant denomination in Malawi.Patrick Johnstone and Jason Mandryk, Operation World: 21st Century Edition (Paternoster, 2001), p. 419. History Following the arrival of David Livingstone, Scottish Presbyterian churches established missions in Malawi. In 1875, the Free Church of Scotland established itself in northern Malawi with headquarters in Livingstonia, while in 1876 the Church of Scotland set up a mission in Blantyre. In 1889 the Cape Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa began work in central Malawi. Initially its base was Mvera, but it later relocated to Nkhoma.Overview of the worldwide reformed church: Malawi (Africa) These three missions were the start of the three CCAP synods in Malawi. In 1911 the Livingstonia and Blantyre Synods agreed to join together to form the CCAPT.

The CCAP at that time had 28 ministers (about half of whom were African) and 32 elders (almost all of whom were African). In 1926, the formerly Dutch Reformed Nkhoma Synod joined the CCAP.Robert Benedetto and Donald K. McKim, Historical Dictionary of the Reformed Churches, 2nd ed, Scarecrow Press, 2010, , p. 443.

New Delhi, India : Discovery Publishing House, 2006. p. 132-133. Host infection by Xcc can occur at any stage of the plant life cycle. Characteristic symptoms of black rot caused by Xcc are V-shaped chlorotic to necrotic lesions extending from the leaf margins and blackening of vascular tissues. The pathogen thrives in warm and humid climates and is rapidly disseminated in the field. Use of clean seed, crop rotation, and other cultural practices are the primary means of control of black rot. However, in developing countries such as those in South and Eastern Africa, black rot remains the greatest impediment to cabbage cultivation due to unreliable \\"clean\\" seed, multiple croppings annually, and high susceptibility of popular local cultivars to the disease. Hosts and symptoms Members of the plant family Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), which includes cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, turnip, oilseed rape, mustard, radish, and the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana are affected by black rot.\\"Black rot of cabbage and other crucifers.\\" Integrated Pest Management. University of Illinois Extension. Dec 1999.Seebold K, Bachi P, and Beale J. \\"Black rot of crucifers .\\" UK Cooperative Extension Service. University of Kentucky. Feb 2008. Host infection by Xcc causes V-shaped chlorotic to necrotic foliar lesions, vascular blackening, wilting, stunted growth, and stem rot symptoms. As the pathogen proceeds from the leaf margins towards the veins, water stress and chlorotic symptoms develop due to occlusion of water-conducting vessels by bacterial exopolysaccharides and components of degraded plant cell walls. The darkening of vascular tissues following bacterial invasion gives the black rot disease its name. Lesions produced by Xcc may serve as portals of entry for other soft-rot pathogens such as Pectobacterium carotovorum (formerly Erwinia carotovora) and Pseudomonas marginalis. These symptoms may be confused with fusarium wilt of cabbage (fusarium yellows), caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans. In contrast to black rot, in which the pathogen invades leaf margins and causes chlorotic to necrotic symptoms that progress downwards in the plant, fusarium wilt symptoms first develop in the lower portions of the plant and move upwards.Sherf, A. \\"Fusarium yellows of cabbage and related crops.\\" New York State Cooperative Extension. Cornell University. Jan 1979. Furthermore, leaf veins invaded by Xcc turn black compared to the dark brown vein discoloration found in fusarium wilt.Sherf, A. \\"Fusarium yellows of cabbage and related crops.\\" New York State Cooperative Extension. Cornell University. Jan 1979.\\"Black rot of cabbage and other crucifers.\\" Integrated Pest Management. University of Illinois Extension. Dec 1999. Symptoms of black rot may vary widely among different species of crucifers. On cauliflower, Xcc infection via stomates causes black or brown specks, scratched leaf margins, black veins, and discolored curds.Miller SA, Sahin F, and Rowe RC. \\"Black rot of crucifers.\\" Extension fact sheet HYG-3125-96. Ohio State University Extension. 1996. Additionally, the severity of symptoms and aggressiveness of the disease varies between different strains of the Xcc pathogen. The isolates can be differentiated into races based on the reaction of several Brassica lines after inoculation. A race structure including 5 races (0 to 4) was first proposed in 1992; a revised classification model with 6 races was proposed in 2001 and, more recently, the model was expanded to include nine races. ::::V-shaped chlorotic to necrotic lesion on cabbage leaf, symptomatic of infection by the black rot pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Photo by David B. Langston, University of Georgia. Disease cycle Life cycle of the black rot pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris by G. Kwan. The primary source of inoculum is Xcc infected seed. During germination, the seedling becomes infected through the epicotyl and cotyledons may develop blackened margins, shrivel, and drop. The bacteria progress through the vascular system to the young stems and leaves, where the disease manifests as V-shaped chlorotic to necrotic lesions extending from the leaf margins. Under humid conditions, bacteria present in guttation droplets can be spread by wind, rain, water splashes, and mechanical equipment to neighboring plants. The natural route of invasion by Xcc is through the hydathodes, though leaf wounds caused by insects and plant roots may also be portals of entry. Occasionally, infections occur through stomata. Hydathodes provide the pathogen a direct path from the leaf margins to the plant vascular system and thus systemic host infection. Invasion of the suture vein leads to production of Xcc infected seed. Xcc can survive in plant debris in soil for up to 2 years, but not more than 6 weeks in free soil. Bacteria present in plant debris can serve as a source of secondary inoculum. Environment Warm and wet conditions favor plant infection by Xcc and the development of disease. Free moisture is required for host invasion, considering that the natural route of infection is through the hydathodes. The optimum temperature range for bacterial growth and host symptom development is between 25° to 30 °C. A slower rate of growth is observed at temperatures as low as 5 °C and up to 35 °C. However, infected hosts are symptomless below 18 °C.Carisse O, Wellman- Desbiens E, Toussaint V, Otis T. \\"Preventing black rot.\\" Government of Canada. Horticultural Research and Development Centre. 1999. Management Management of black rot relies heavily on cultural practices: :* Use of certified disease-free seeds and transplants :* Hot water treatment of non-certified seeds; chemical treatments with sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and hot cupuric acetate or zinc sulfate may also be used :* Control of insects :* Crop rotation with non-cruciferous plants (3–4 years) :* Removal of crop debris after harvest :* Control of cruciferous weeds that may serve as reservoir for the pathogen :* Sanitation (e.g., clean equipment, avoiding work in wet fields, etc.) The development and use of black rot resistant cultivars has long been recognised as an important method of control, but in practice has had limited success. Resistance to the most important pathogenic races of Xcc is rare in B. oleracea (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower); the most common and potentially useful sources of black rot resistance occur in other brassica genomes including B. rapa, B. nigra, B. napus, B. carinata and B. juncea. Resistant or tolerant cabbage cultivars are available and include: :* Atlantis :* Blueboy :* Bravo :* Bronco :* Cecile :* Defender :* Dynasty :* Gladiator :* Guardian :* Hancock :* Ramada Significance=Economic impact Cabbage cultivation is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide, reflecting its value as a vegetable crop, source of vegetable oil, component of fodder crop for livestock feed, and ingredient in condiments and spices. In 2007, the cabbage crop in the US exceed $413M (1.4M+ tons).United States. Department of Agriculture. U.S. Cabbage Statistics - U.S. fresh cabbage: Area, yield, production, & value, 1960-2007. May 2008. Black rot is considered the most important disease of cabbage and other crucifers because Xcc infections may not become apparent until the warm summer months (well after planting), the pathogen spreads rapidly, and losses due to the disease may exceed 50% in warm, wet climates. The importance of using disease-free seed and/or transplants is highlighted by the fact that \\"as few as three infected seeds in 10,000 (0.03%) can cause black rot epidemics in a field.\\" In transplant beds, an initial infection level of 0.5% can rise to 65% in just three weeks. In fact more recent work indicates that spread can be much more rapid than this: with overhead gantry irrigation, spread of the pathogen greatly exceeded symptom spread to the extent that in one experiment almost 100% of the transplants were infested in a block of 15 module trays (around 4500 plants) six weeks after sowing from a single primary infector. Modelling of the rate of spread in transplants indicates that the widely used tolerance standard for seed health testing (0·01%) should be revised to 0·004%.Roberts SJ (2009) Transmission and spread of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris in brassica transplants: implications for seed health standards.

Implicit contracts theory was first developed to explain why there are quantity adjustments (layoffs) instead of price adjustments (falling wages) in the labor market during recessions.Azariadis, Costas., and Joseph Stiglitz., \\"Implicit Contracts and fixed Price Equilibria\\", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol.XCVIII 1983 Supplement. The origins of implicit-contract theory lie in the belief that observed movements in wages and employment cannot be adequately explained by a competitive spot labour- market in which wages are always equal to the marginal product of labour and the labour market is always in equilibrium. In the context of the labor market, an implicit contract is an employment agreement between an employer and an employee that specifies how much labor is supplied by the worker and how much wage is paid by the employer under different circumstances in the future. An implicit contract can be an explicitly written document or a tacit agreement (some people call the former an \\"explicit contract\\"). The contract is self-enforcing, meaning that neither of the two parties would be willing to breach the implicit contract in absence of any external enforcement since both parties would be worse off otherwise. The interpersonal negotiation and agreement in implicit contracts contrasts with the impersonal and nonnegotiable decision making in a decentralized competitive markets. As Arthur Melvin Okun puts it: a contract market is like an \\"invisible handshake\\" rather than the invisible hand.Okun, Arthur., \\"Prices and quantities\\", Wash., DC: The Brookings Institution, 1981. Implicit contracts in the labor market= Layoff puzzle In traditional economic theory, a worker takes their wage as given and decides how many hours they work. The firm also takes the wage as given and decides how much labor to buy. Then wage is determined in the market to ensure total labor supply equals total labor demand. If workers supply more labor than firms demand, then the wage level should fall so that workers will work fewer hours and firms would demand more labor. Hence, when firms reduce labor demand during a recession, we should expect to see a fall in wages as well. However, in reality, firms layoff redundant workers while keeping the wage unchanged for the rest of the workforce,Feldstein, Martin., \\"The Importance of Temporary Layoffs: An Empirical Analysis\\", Brookings Pap. Econ. Act., 1975, 3, pp725-44.https://www.jstor.org/stable/2534152 and the wage compensation fluctuates considerably less than employment does in a typical business cycle.Hall, Robert., \\"Employment Fluctuations and Wage Rigidity\\", Brookings Pap. Econ. Act.,1980, 1, pp91-123. Therefore, the law of supply and demand is insufficient to explain patterns in wages and employment.  Implicit contracts as insurance In an effort to explain the layoff puzzle, models with implicit contracts were independently developed by Martin Baily, Donald Gordon, and Costas Azariadis in 1974 and 1975.Azariadis, Costas, \\"Implicit contracts and underemployment equilibria\\", Journal of Political Economy, 1975.Baily, M., \\"Wages and employment under uncertain demand\\", Review of Economic Studies 41, 37-50, 1974.Gordon, D.F., \\"A neoclassical theory of Keynesian unemployment\\", Economic Inquiry 12, 431-49, 1974. In their models, the firm and its workers are not simply the buyer and sellers of labor service in a sequential spot market; Instead, the employer and workers engage in a long term relationship that enables risk sharing. The key insight (or assumption) is that the employers are risk neutral while the workers are risk averse. This difference in attitude towards risk enables both parties to benefit from a long term employment relationship. Under the implicit contract, a worker is able to reduce the fluctuation in their labor income and the employer is able to increase their average profit. Hence, both parties are better off than being in the spot market. Therefore, the implicit contract between a worker and an employer is like insurance used to hedge the risk in the spot labor market. Layoffs act as the insurance premium that workers pay for the stability in the insurance schedule in the long run.  Decline of the theory in labor economics Despite the popularity of implicit contract theory in the 1980s, applications of the implicit contracts theory in labor economics has been in decline since the 1990s. The theory has been replaced by search and matching theory to explain labor market imperfections. Implicit contracts in capital market Capital market shares some of the \\"imperfections\\" of the labor market discussed above: long term relationships between banks and borrowers act like the long term employment relationship between an employer and their workers. Like layoffs in the labor market, there is credit rationing in the financial market. Also, a typical loan contract is just like an employment contract illustrated in the model above: the loan repayment is fixed in all states of nature as long as the borrower is solvent. Hence naturally, economists tried to extend and apply the implicit contract theory to explain these phenomena in the capital market. The earliest studies to employ implicit contracts models in capital markets see the existence of credit rationing as part of an equilibrium risk-sharing arrangement between a bank and its customer: the bank is risk neutral, and the borrower is risk averse, hence they gain from a long term relationship via shifting the interest rate risk from the borrower to the bank. If loans are negotiated in the spot market, then the borrower would be exposed to fluctuations in the spot market interest rates on her loan. Instead, if the borrower engages in an implicit contract with a bank, the bank can shield the borrower from fluctuations in the spot market by offering her a constant rate on the loan and in return for a higher average interest rate in the long run. However, if every bank charges a higher interest rate than the average rate in the spot market, then there would be credit rationing.Fried, Joel., and Peter Howitt., \\"Credit rationing and implicit contract theory\\", JMCB, 1980.https://ideas.repec.org/a/mcb/jmoncb/v12y1980i3p471-87.html This approach hinges on the assumption that agents (bank and the borrower) have different attitudes towards risk. However, more recent studies of capital markets do not rely on different attitudes towards risk, instead they focus on asymmetric information and the default risk in the capital markets. Also, implicit contracts have been playing an important role in explaining credit rationing under asymmetric information.  Implicit contracts under adverse selection Some argue that the creditor-debtor long term relationship arises from the valuable \\"inside information\\" revealed via repeated bank-firm interactions.Sharpe, Steven A., \\"Asymmetric Information, Bank Lending, and Implicit Contracts: A Stylized Model of Customer Relationships\\", The Journal of Finance, September 1990. https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v45y1990i4p1069-87.html This \\"inside information\\" reduces the information asymmetries and identifies the most productive firms (those with lower default risks). Hence the bank is able to better allocate financial resources and ensure that more capital goes to higher quality firms. This view is usually referred to as relationship banking, and it has attracted significant research interests in the field of finance. The empirical evidence for relationship banking is mixed. A recent study shows \\"that repeated borrowing from the same lender translates into a 10–17 basis points lowering of loan spreads and that relationships are especially valuable when borrower transparency is low\\" by using data from the US,Bharath, Sreedhar T., Sandeep Dahiya, Anthony Saunders, and Anand Srinivasan., \\"Lending Relationships and Loan Contract Terms\\", Review of Financial Studies, first published online October 7, 2009. However, using survey data from Japan, another recent study finds that the long term relationship between borrower and lender \\"in some cases increased cost, from stronger relationships for opaque borrowers and for borrowers who get funding from small banks. These latter findings suggest the possibility that relationship borrowers may suffer from capture effects\\".Kanoa., Masaji, Hirofumi Uchidab., Gregory F. Udellc., and Wako Watanabed., \\"Information verifiability, bank organization, bank competition and bank–borrower relationships\\", Journal of Banking & Finance, Volume 35, Issue 4, April 2011, pp. 935-954.  Implicit contracts under moral hazard The relationship banking approach focuses on adverse selection as the main consequence of the information imperfection between lender and the borrower; however, there is also the problem of moral hazard. In general there are two moral hazard problems related to the capital market. First, borrowers could lie about their financial situation and not repay their debts in full. If the lender could not check whether the borrower is lying, then there might not be any lending in the market at all, especially when the debt is unsecured. Second, when a borrower, for example, a firm makes a bad decision that leads to its bankruptcy, it does not bear the full consequence of her mistake since part of the cost will be borne by the bank that helps finance the project. Therefore, the firm is likely to make riskier decisions when the investment is financed by a bank than when the investment is financed out of the firm's own pocket. Economists show that these problems could be solved by an implicit contract in which the borrower has to pay some costs when she defaults on the debt. The borrower's cost of default can be the expense of hiring lawyers and accountants to persuade the lender of her financial distress,Gale, Douglas., and Martin Hellwig., \\"Incentive-Compatible Debt Contracts: The One-Period Problem\\", The Review of Economic Studies, Vol.52. No. 4., 1985. pp.647-663. exclusion from capital market and future borrowing,Eaton, Johnathan., and Mark Gersovitz., \\"Debt with Potential Repudiation\\", Review of Economic Studies, April 1981, 48, pp.289-309. or economic sanctions if the borrower is a country.Bulow, Jeremy., and Kenneth Rogoff., \\"A constant Recontracting Model of Sovereign Debt\\", The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 97. No.1, 1989, pp.155-178. However, since some of these costs will reduce the amount collectible to the lender in the bankruptcy, the expected rate of return is lower than if there were no moral hazard problems. Therefore, the investment level would also be lower, causing credit rationing in the size of loans.  Implicit contracts in current research  Credit rationing in the size of loans is also known as borrowing constraints. In recent years, many macroeconomists have become interested in firm level data and firm behaviors. There is widespread evidence supporting the conjecture that borrowing constraints may be important determinants of firm growth and survival.Fazzari, Steven, Glenn Hubbard, and Bruce Petersen, “Financing Constraints and Corporate Investment,” Brooking Papers on Economic Activity, 1 (1988), 141–206.Gilchrist, Simon, and Charles Himmelberg, “Evidence on the Role of Cash Flow for Investment,” Journal of Monetary Economics, XXXVI (1994), 541–572. Many of these studies model borrowing constraint as a consequence of an optimal implicit contract when there is asymmetric information between the borrower and lender.Clementi, Gian L., and Hugo A. Hopenhayn. 2006. “A Theory of Financing Constraints and Firm Dynamics.” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121(1): 229–65.Biais., Bruno., Thomas Mariotti., Jean-Charles Rochet., Stéphane Villeneuve., \\"Large risks, limited liability, and dynamic moral hazard\\", Econometrica, Volume 78, Issue 1, January 2010, pp. 73–118. Thus, despite its declining popularity among labor economists, implicit contract theory still plays an important role in understanding capital market imperfections.

Paved roads run along the section lines throughout at intervals. Terrain in the vicinity of the oil field is almost table-flat, with elevations ranging from approximately above sea level throughout the productive region. The land rises with a slight gradient to the south and east, in the direction of the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains. Climate is typical of the southern San Joaquin Valley, and is arid. Temperatures in the summer routinely exceed on cloudless days. Rain falls mainly in the winter months, and averages annually. Freezes occur occasionally during the winter, and the winter months are also subject to frequent dense tule fogs, limiting visibility to near zero. Drainage from the field is generally into the irrigation canal system, but because of the flat surface gradient most rainfall soaks directly into the ground. Air quality in the vicinity of the oil field, and in Kern County in general, is among the worst in the United States.

Since fields to the north, including Kern River, Kern Front, and Edison, were already producing, it was a reasonable inference that their oil- bearing strata extended to the south, out of sight underneath the alluvium. The overall structure of the field is a faulted homocline, with all the sedimentary units dipping in the same direction with little folding. The formations have a general strike towards the northwest, and dip to the southwest about for each mile. Updip migration of petroleum is blocked by impermeable units placed there by vertical fault offsets, with the faults being numerous, and the largest roughly following the strike of the beds.Miller, R.H. and Bloom, C.V. Mountain View Oil Field: California Division of Oil and Gas, Summary of Operations. 1937. Vol. 22 No. 4. 6, 14 Numerous oil-producing formations have been identified within the Mountain View field, ranging in age from the basement Jurassic schist, which itself contains some oil pools, all the way to Pliocene-Pleistocene at the top of the stratigraphic column. Viewed from above, the field is broken out into five discontiguous areas: the large Main Area, the Arvin and West Arvin areas near the town of that name, the abandoned Di Giorgio Area, and the Vaccaro Area in the extreme south-southeast. History, production, and operations Numerous attempts were made to find the field, which was long suspected to exist. The first well in the area was drilled in 1924, and produced a small amount of oil, failing after four days. In the following years several more wells were drilled, including some by Shell Oil and Mohawk Petroleum Company, but all failed until Hogan Petroleum hit the rich Wharton pool in the Santa Margarita Formation at about below ground surface in May 1933. This well initially produced with a pressure of approximately —a strong finding that brought other drillers to the area in short order.Miller and Bloom, 6-7 Subsequent wells expanding outwards from the discovery well delineated the limits of the main productive area by the late 1930s. In 1936, Mohawk Petroleum discovered the DiGiorgio Area by hitting oil in the Santa Margarita Formation.DOGGR, 309 The West Arvin area was discovered in 1937, with a well drilled into the Cattani pool of the Chanac Formation.DOGGR, 307 Also in 1937, General Petroleum Corp. of California discovered the Vaccaro Area. Each of these areas yielded subsequent discoveries in other deeper pools throughout the 1940s and 1950s. In 1986, a new discovery was made in the Kern River Formation in the Arvin Area, and smaller pools continue to be found in the widely dispersed oil field – for example, in 2006 Vaquero Energy, one of the field's current operators, found a new pool in the once-abandoned DiGiorgio area in the underlying schist basement rock.DOGGR, 306DOGGR (2009), 239 As of the beginning of 2009, 175 wells remained active on the field, distributed between five discontiguous areas. Field-wide, the average production per well is of oil per day, with an 81 percent water cut (approximately four barrels of water come out of the reservoir for every barrel of oil). The Main Area remains the most productive, followed by the West Arvin and Arvin areas; many of the wells in these areas are slant-drilled to reach formations directly under the town.DOGGR (2009), 96Matthews, 6 NotesReferences * California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III.

A visitor center was built in 1991, and features displays of plant and marine fossils, petrified wood and fossilized dinosaur bones over 150 million years old (Upper Jurassic Period). The Petrified Forest Trail is a one-mile (1.6 km) loop, winding up the side of a mesa to the top where most of the fossil wood occurs. Logs two feet or more in diameter are seen at several places along the trail where it is eroding from the conglomerate capping the mesa. This conglomerate lies near the top of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation.Morgan, S., B.W. Lindsay and A.P. Williams 2010. Geology of Escalante State Park, Utah.

Utah Geological Association Publication 28 The wood is multicolored (mostly red, yellow, white, and black) and was prized by hobbyists before the Park was established. The logs are believed to be of conifers that were transported by a river before being buried and later fossilized as agate. A 50 foot (15m) log is displayed near the trail head and is one of the most complete fossil logs known from the Morrison Formation.

Isaac Newton stated it as lemma 28 of section VI of book 1 of Newton's Principia, and used it to show that the position of a planet moving in an orbit is not an algebraic function of time. There has been some controversy about whether or not this theorem is correct because Newton did not state exactly what he meant by an oval, and for some interpretations of the word oval the theorem is correct, while for others it is false. If \\"oval\\" means \\"continuous convex curve\\", then there are counterexamples, such as triangles or one of the lobes of Huygens lemniscate y2 = x2 − x4, while pointed that if \\"oval\\" means \\"infinitely differentiable convex curve\\" then Newton's claim is correct and his argument has the essential steps of a rigorous proof. generalized Newton's theorem to higher dimensions. Statement The lemniscate of Gerono or Huygens; the area cut off by a secant is algebraic, but the lemniscate is not smooth at the origin An English translation Newton's original statement is: : \\"There is no oval figure whose area, cut off by right lines at pleasure, can be universally found by means of equations of any number of finite terms and dimensions.\\" In modern mathematical language, Newton essentially proved the following theorem: : There is no convex smooth (meaning infinitely differentiable) curve such that the area cut off by a line ax + by = c is an algebraic function of a, b, and c. In other words, \\"oval\\" in Newton's statement should mean \\"convex smooth curve\\". The infinite differentiability at all points is necessary: For any positive integer n there are algebraic curves that are smooth at all but one point and differentiable n times at the remaining point for which the area cut off by a secant is algebraic. Newton observed that a similar argument shows that the arclength of a (smooth convex) oval between two points is not given by an algebraic function of the points. Newton's proof If the oval is a circle centered at the origin, then the spiral constructed by Newton is an Archimedean spiral. Newton took the origin P inside the oval, and considered the spiral of points (r, θ) in polar coordinates whose distance r from P is the area cut off by the lines from P with angles 0 and θ. He then observed that this spiral cannot be algebraic as it has an infinite number of intersections with a line through P, so the area cut off by a secant cannot be an algebraic function of the secant. This proof requires that the oval and therefore the spiral be smooth; otherwise the spiral might be an infinite union of pieces of different algebraic curves. This is what happens in the various \\"counterexamples\\" to Newton's theorem for non-smooth ovals. References  Alternative translation of earlier (2nd) edition of Newton's Principia.

History  While the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (Cöln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME) was building its trunk line between Cologne and Minden via Duisburg between 1843 and 1847, the shareholders of the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company (Ruhrort–Crefeld−Kreis Gladbach Eisenbahngesellschaft, RCG) were looking for a way to bring coal from the Ruhr to industries on the western bank of the Rhine cheaply. Technology had not yet developed for building a bridge over the Rhine. In addition, prior to the Austro-Prussian War, the Prussian military opposed the building of a fixed bridge across the Rhine for military reasons, except in fortified cities such as Cologne, Mainz, Koblenz and Düsseldorf. Therefore, the RCG decided to build a train ferry between its left (western) bank terminus in Homberg and the right bank port of Ruhrort. Construction of the railway lines  On 29 March 1847 the RCG entered into a contract with the CME to connect the lines of both companies and for the transport of passenger carriages and freight wagons across the Rhine. In May 1847, the RCG began construction of its line from Viersen via Krefeld to Homberg, which was opened on 15 October 1849. The CME completed its branch line from Oberhausen to Ruhrort on 14 October 1848. Construction of ramps  Lack of experience in Germany with train ferries led the RCG to begin the movement of wagons with a simple system of ramps, but using imported facilities that had not been tested in advance. On both sides wagons were lowered, initially using chains and later ropes, from the top of the river banks down a slope of 1 in 12 to the edge of pontoon docks—these railway basins still exist. The wagons were then moved on to pontoons over rails that had been temporarily installed over the water. On the other side the wagons were towed up the ramp by a locomotive using the same system of chains or ropes. Each pontoon could carry three wagons. They were attached on both sides of a small steamer and crossed the Rhine for the first time on 12 November 1852. Despite the problems caused by ice and floods and in spite of many breaks of chains and ropes, the ferry initially moved up to 700 carriages and wagons each month. In 1855 32,000 wagons were moved across the Rhine, but this was the limit of capacity. Construction of the hydraulic lifting system  Homberg-Ruhrort train ferry, sideview of the lift tower with steam ferry \\"Rhein\\". To increase throughput the railway company decided to build on both banks in addition to the ramps a tower with a hydraulically actuated lift. The plants were supplied and installed by an English company. Two freight wagons or passenger carriages could be carried up to 8.5 metres up or down. A purpose-built 52 metre long and 8 metre wide steamer could carry twelve freight wagons or four carriages on every trip. The ship had four steam boilers and a tall chimney on each side. Inside there were rooms in the ship for the passengers who did not remain in the carriages. The construction of the lift systems began in the summer of 1854 and went into service on 1 May 1856. In the same year 47,050 cars were carried. On peak traffic days, parallel operations continued on the ramps. However, there were several significant disruptions as a result of storms, ice and floods. Takeover by the BME  After the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME) took over the company on 1 January 1866 (which until then had been owned by the Royal Division of the Aachen-Düsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company, Königliche Direction der Aachen-Düsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn), it started major repairs and improvements to increase the efficiency of the train ferry service. The ramps were lowered to a 1 in 24 grade so that longer vehicles could be loaded. With the commissioning of another ferry, the capacity of the train ferry operation was increased to 100,000 wagons annually. After the opening of the new coal line by the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinischen Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, RhE) from Osterath near Krefeld via Rheinhausen to Essen, including the Rheinhausen–Hochfeld train ferry, on 23 August 1866 and especially after the opening of the Duisburg–Hochfeld rail bridge in 1874, the BME’s train ferry lost traffic until the nationalisation of the private railway companies in 1881. In 1881 about 80,000 wagons were still carried by train ferry. The BME rebuilt one of the lift towers in 1876 after a fire. Closure  The Royal Prussian State Railways (Königlich Preußische Staatseisenbahnen) took over the BME in 1882. According to various sources train ferry operations were discontinued on 1 April 1885. An ordinary ferry service continued to operate for passenger until the opening of the Homberg–Ruhrort road bridge in 1907. The dilapidated lift tower at the Ruhrort site was demolished in 1971. Its counterpart in Homberg still stands and was occasionally used as a Youth Hostel. It is now part of The Industrial Heritage Trail.

Barukh ben Yosef Romm founded the business originally in Grodno and it continued there for some decades at the same time that its primary operations moved to Vilnius in 1799. There, it expanded under the ownership of Barukh's son, Menahem Mann Romm (d. 1841), at the same time that it ceased its Grodno operation.The Jewish encyclopedia 1925 \\"The establishment was inherited by his son Menahem Man Romm, who in 1835 commenced, in partnership with Simhah Zimmel of Grodno, to publish a new edition of the Talmud.\\"Žydų gyvenimas Lietuvoje: parodos katalogas Rūta Puišytė, Darius Staliūnas - 2007 \\"8 The Vilnius printers Menachem Romm and Dvoira Romm. Boruch Romm set up the first Jewish press in Lithuania in Grodno. From 1823 it operated in Vilnius. Between 1829 and 1833 it published 111 religious books. In the decade 1847-1857 the Romms published 460 Jewish books.\\" Initially publishing halakhic and homiletic works from the misnagdic tradition, the Romms were soon caught up in the controversy between adherents of this tradition and the new movement among Eastern European Jews known as Hasidism. Historically, Jewish authors from Lite (the Yiddish name for a conceptual rather than historical \\"greater\\" Lithuania that has not always corresponded to the country's actual physical boundaries) had sent their manuscripts abroad, to Amsterdam, Prague, Germany, Poland, and the Ukraine, for publication. The rivalry between Misnagdism and Hasidism led the former to begin publishing within Lithuania itself, specifically, in 1788, when Barukh Romm went from book dealer to book publisher. Controversy had arisen when the Shapira family of Slavuta intended to publish a new edition of the Talmud in line with an Hasidic point of view. Rabbis on each side argued but were unable to agree as to whether rabbinical law permitted publication of this new edition. In addition, the death of a worker in the Slavuta factory led to Russian government intervention (Vilnius being at that time within the Russian Empire). The Slavuta publishing house was shut down and, to instill order among the Jewish publishers, the Russian authorities instituted a formal publishing monopoly, which Romm successfully bid for. In 1835, located as they were in Vilnius, which was the heart of misnagdic Lite, the Romms caused a stir by publishing the hasidic talmud. From then until 1940 (when it was nationalized by the Soviet government), the Romms published material from the diversity of Litvak Jewish religious opinion and practice. The Romm factory burned down in 1840, but was soon rebuilt, and prospered through both its monopolistic privileges and the rapidly increasing Jewish population of the region. When Chaim-Yankev Romm died in 1858, David Romm took over the firm. He was married to Deborah Harkavy (c. 1831 - December 1903), daughter of Rabbi Yeysef-Betsalel Harkavy of Novogrudok. The Harkavy family produced many significant scholars, including Yiddish lexicographer Alexander Harkavy (1863-1939). When David Romm died in 1862, Deborah took over management of the firm, renaming it The Widow and Brothers Romm in 1863. As The Widow Romm, she was known internationally by Hebrew and Yiddish scholars and general readers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, giving her an unusual stature for Litvak women of her time. She was often challenged, but her good business sense along with her scrupulous attention to quality and detail kept power over the firm in her hands. Under her direction, the firm produced a highly regarded new edition of the Talmud, completed in 1886, which is still widely used. The firm's last Talmud edition was printed in 1897, after which the rise of Zionism shifted Jewish publishing. When Deborah Romm died, the firm also started to print secular periodicals and newspapers in Yiddish and Hebrew. This was not to the liking of the person who was the manager until then, Samuel Shraga Fiignzon (שפן סופר). Deborah Romm's descendants lost interest in managing the press (with three of her sons emigrating to the United States), and the printing press got into financial difficulty. Baron David Günzburg from St. Petersburg, a scholar of Jewish affairs, came to the rescue and bought the firm in 1910. When the Baron died soon after, his widow could not continue ownership of what was by then an unprofitable printing house. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 almost caused the firm's closure. Thanks to the efforts of the Rabbi of St. Petersburg, Dr. Moshe Eliezer Eisenstadt, the printing house was bought by two wealthy individuals, Noah Gordon and Haim Cohen, who volunteered to rescue the printing house because of its importance. The printing house changed its name again to The Stock Company for Printing Books and Publishing \\"Romm\\". At the request of Noah Gordon, in 1920 his cousin, Mathus Rapoport, took over the management of the printing house and also became one of the owners. Rapoport ran the printing house for 20 years. On the night of July 7, 1941, just days after the German invasion of Russia, Rapoport was taken from his home at midnight and was murdered by the Nazis. With the end of the Second World War the building was confiscated by the Russians. They continued to use the printing house after the war until the beginning of the 1990s but with no connection to Judaism. On February 4, 1990, Professor Herman Branover presented the Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson with a Russian-language translation of the Jewish Hasidic text, the Tanya, which had been recently printed, in the quantity of 20,000 units, in the facilities of the Romm publishing house in Vilna.

Objective A SOC is related to the people, processes and technologies that provide situational awareness through the detection, containment, and remediation of IT threats. A SOC will handle, on behalf of an institution or company, any threatening IT incident, and will ensure that it is properly identified, analyzed, communicated, investigated and reported. The SOC also monitors applications to identify a possible cyber-attack or intrusion (event), and determines if it is a genuine malicious threat (incident), and if it could affect business. Regulatory requirements Establishing and operating a SOC is expensive and difficult; organisations should need a good reason to do it. This may include: * Protecting sensitive data * Complying with industry rules such as PCI DSS. * Complying with government rules, such as CESG GPG53. Alternative names A security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC), security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC. Technology SOCs typically are based around a security information and event management (SIEM) system which aggregates and correlates data from security feeds such as network discovery and vulnerability assessment systems; governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems; web site assessment and monitoring systems, application and database scanners; penetration testing tools; intrusion detection systems (IDS); intrusion prevention system (IPS); log management systems; network behavior analysis and Cyber threat intelligence; wireless intrusion prevention system; firewalls, enterprise antivirus and unified threat management (UTM). The SIEM technology creates a \\"single pane of glass\\" for the security analysts to monitor the enterprise. People SOC staff includes analysts, security engineers, and SOC managers who should be seasoned IT and networking professionals. They are usually trained in computer engineering, cryptography, network engineering, or computer science and may have credentials such as CISSP or GIAC. SOC staffing plans range from eight hours a day, five days a week (8x5) to twenty four hours a day, seven days a week (24x7). Shifts should include at least two analysts and the responsibilities should be clearly defined. Organization Large organizations and governments may operate more than one SOC to manage different groups of information and communication technology or to provide redundancy in the event one site is unavailable. SOC work can be outsourced, for instance, by using a managed security service. The term SOC was traditionally used by governments and managed computer security providers, although a growing number of large corporations and other organizations also have such centers. The SOC and the network operations center (NOC) complement each other and work in tandem. The NOC is usually responsible for monitoring and maintaining the overall network infrastructure, and its primary function is to ensure uninterrupted network service. The SOC is responsible for protecting networks, as well as web sites, applications, databases, servers and data centers, and other technologies. Likewise, the SOC and the physical security operations center coordinate and work together. The physical SOC is a facility in large organizations where security staff monitor and control security officers/guards, alarms, CCTV, physical access, lighting, vehicle barriers, etc. Not every SOC has the same role. There are three different focus areas in which a SOC may be active, and which can be combined in any combination: *Control - focusing on the state of the security with compliancy testing, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, etc. *Monitoring - focusing on events and the response with log monitoring, SIEM administration, and incident response *Operational - focusing on the operational security administration such as identity & access management, key management, firewall administration, etc. In some cases the SOC, NOC or physical SOC may be housed in the same facility or organizationally combined, especially if the focus is on operational tasks. If the SOC originates from a CERT organisation, then the focus is usually more on monitoring and control, in which case the SOC operates independently from the NOC to maintain separation of duties. Typically, larger organizations maintain a separate SOC to ensure focus and expertise. The SOC then collaborates closely with network operations and physical security operations. Facilities SOCs usually are well protected with physical, electronic, computer, and personnel security. Centers are often laid out with desks facing a video wall, which displays significant status, events and alarms; ongoing incidents; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the SOC staff aware of current events which may affect information systems. A security engineer or security analyst may have several computer monitors on their desk. Process and procedures Processes and procedures within a SOC will clearly spell out roles and responsibilities as well as monitoring procedures. These processes include business, technology, operational and analytical processes. They lay out what steps are to be taken in the event of an alert or breach including escalation procedures, reporting procedures, and breach response procedures.  CloudSOC  A cloud security operations center (CloudSOC) may be set up to monitor cloud service use within an enterprise (and keep the Shadow IT problem under control), or parse and audit IT infrastructure and application logs via SIEM technologies and machine data platforms (such as LogRhythm, Splunk, IBM QRadar, Arctic Wolf Networks, Assuria, Fusus, HP ArcSight, CYBERShark and Elastica) to provide alerts and details of suspicious activity.  Smart SOC  A Smart SOC (Security Operations Center) is a comprehensive, technology agnostic cybersecurity solution that utilizes leading-edge technology and tools, highly skilled and experienced human talent (composed of cyber intelligence gatherers, analysts, and security experts), and proactive cyberwarfare principles to prevent and neutralize threats against an organization’s digital infrastructure, assets, and data.

History Under the name \\"Solipsys\\", the band was started by guitarist John Ronkar and drummer Josh Neumann. Along with vocalist Brian Binz, bassist Matt Orosz, and lead guitarist (and Ronkar's cousin) John Bevis, Solipsys released its self recorded and produced album titled Terminal in March 2005. After opening for major touring acts such as 3 Inches of Blood, Solipsys parted ways with vocalist Binz. Solipsys then changed the name to Steelscape after finding replacement vocalist Ryan Coleman. Steelscape released a four song EP titled Cleanse and Divide in 2007. After a low point in the bands performing and recognition, Coleman moved to Florida once again leaving the band without a singer. After several failed auditions, the remaining four members of Steelscape decided to remain instrumental. The band began to see an increased popularity as a strictly instrumental band as they continued to grow their underground fan base in local bars and venues. They re-released the Cleanse and Divide EP without any vocals in early 2008. In June 2009, John Bevis left Steelscape after being accepted to a school in Texas. Steelscape then found lead guitarist Kevin Crew to replace Bevis. Within three months of Crew joining the band, Wildcard Movies (a northwest film production company for extreme sports such as snowboarding, wakeboarding, etc.) asked Steelscape to provide their track \\"Blueshift\\" to their first production titled How The Northwest Was One. Steelscape's \\"Blueshift\\" was used in the movie as well as on the teaser, which was broadcast on national television on Fuel TV's The Daily Habit on September 4, 2009. Fuel TV continued to air How The Northwest Was One throughout the next several weeks. Steelscape released its latest EP titled Blueshift in mid-2009. This is an enhanced CD which includes five studio tracks, three live tracks, and bonus footage including the making of the track \\"Absolute Horizon\\". The release brought Steelscape a large amount of publicity including a headlining article in the area newspaper. In May 2010, Steelscape was again approached by Wildcard Movies to provide music for their latest release The Saturday Night Ride. The band was asked to provide three of their original tracks and to score a track specifically for the main theme of the movie. Steelscape was again used on both teasers released by Wildcard Movies. The teasers reached a national status being featured on espn.com, Transworld Snowboarding, and numerous other websites. Steelscape was then asked to play The Saturday Night Ride movie premiere at The King Cat Theater in Seattle, Washington on October 8, 2010. Steelscape's current lineup is: Guitar - John Ronkar, Guitar - Kevin Crew, Bass - Matt Orosz, Drums - Josh Neumann.

Ballet was born on 11 December 1956 at Cherbourg, in Normandy. She was in residence at the Villa Medici in Rome in 1984 and 1985. She became known in 1985 with two sculptures made out of cardboard, Temple 5/19 février 1985 and Obélisque 4+14. An internationally renowned artist, Élisabeth Ballet now lives and works in Paris.  Work  Ballet is interested in the combination of abstraction and subject taken from reality. Based on her perception of space, she has defined a program which adjusts her desires and her way of working. Her work involves questions of movement in space, of the articulation of the outside and the inside, the transition from words to things, from drawing to sculpture, wall to center, plan to volume and more generally from one work to another. Her sculpture represents thought in action ; it is totally readable (transparent surfaces, recording of their environment) and keeps the spectator at a distance. In other words, it requires the mind to wander.

He previously played for the and the in Super Rugby and for the and in the Currie Cup before joining . Sharks Profile At the end of January 2020, Alberts confirmed his move back to his roots to rejoin the , in order to help them with their Super Rugby campaign. Lions officially lock in Alberts He was schooled at Hoërskool Monument in Krugersdorp. Career Alberts made his professional debut for the Golden Lions in 2007. In that same year he was awarded his debut in the Super 14, playing against the Waratahs. He moved to the Sharks in 2010. In October 2010, Willem was selected to the Springbok squad of 39 players to prepare for the November tour of Europe. He is known for his punishing runs (often requiring more than one tackler to stop him) and his rock solid defence. Due to his colossal mass (120 kg) Alberts' bruising runs and bone- crunching tackling, that often constitute \\"big hits\\", have made him a crowd favorite and earned him a large following. During the 2010 Currie Cup semi- final against the Vodacom Blue Bulls Alberts was awarded \\"Man-of-the-Match\\" after he put in a solid performance consisting of 21 ball carries gaining 144 metres. It is after a string of monumental performances for the Sharks that Alberts was named as part of the Springbok squad ahead of the 2010 Northern Hemisphere grand slam tour. Alberts made his debut for South Africa off the bench on 13 November 2010 and scored a try against Wales. Many believe that Alberts' impact was so great off the bench that he alone swung the game in the Boks favor and pulled them through. He won his second Springbok cap against Scotland, when he once again came on off the bench and scored a powerful try after plucking the ball from the air in a line out and driving over the whitewash. However, his exploits were not enough and the Boks lost the game. His third cap came the following weekend against England at Twickenham. Alberts would come onto the field once more in the number 19 jersey and would score another try, this time in the corner which buried the English side and Alberts was branded \\"Super Sub\\". Willem Alberts made his run on debut against the Barbarians at Twickenham in the unfamiliar open side flanker berth. Although he did not score a try the test did not count as an official cap and Alberts returned to South Africa with a 100% try scoring record on his debut tour. 2011 Season Alberts played in all eighteen of the Sharks matches in the 2011 Super Rugby season. He won his first \\"Man-of-the-Match\\" award in the Super Rugby competition for the Sharks for his performance against the Cheetahs. He also scored his first Super Rugby try for the Sharks against the Western Force in a bonus point win for the Sharks. He went on to score another try against the Crusaders in a historic match held at Twickenham. He won another man of the match award against the Lions, making an impressive 18 ball carries. Alberts is the Sharks' leading tackler in their 2011 Super Rugby campaign with an average of 10 tackles per match and is the third highest in the entire tournament with 58. Against the Hurricanes he made an imperious 23 tackles, and in such form has made him a big name in South African rugby. Alberts made his starting capped debut for the Springboks against the All Blacks in Port Elizabeth on 10 August 2011 in the number 7 jersey. Alberts showed his grunt with 13 tackles and bruised his way into Peter de Villiers' World Cup plans. 2012 Season Alberts started against England which South Africa won 22-17. He also scored a try in the second test which South Africa won 36-27. The Springboks wrapped up the series in that win. He was injured and out for the final test which South Africa held to a 14-14 draw against England. Potgieter replaced Alberts at blindside flanker. Alberts has a good future after South Africa won the series against England in which Alberts was a big performer. Early life Alberts was one of the seven-year-old children selected in 1992 to appear in 7 Up in South Africa, the South African version of the Up series. He has appeared in the documentary every 7 years since then, and has covered aspects of his life including his early life on a farm, the death of his father in a car accident and his family's subsequent move to the city.

He later became a fashion photographer.  Early life Gallant was born Ira Gallantz in the Bronx, New York into a Russian Jewish family. He had a brother who was murdered in the 1980s. Gallant, who was openly gay, eventually began styling hair. He later admitted \\"...I hated it [hair styling]. But I was good at it. . . . I had always thought to be talented at something, you had to like it.” Gallant began his career at Bergdorf Goodman as a hairstylist, and eventually became one of New York City's top colorists. He later changed his name to \\"Ara Gallant\\" because he felt it sounded \\"more exotic\\".  Career  In the 1960s, Gallant started working for Vogue as a hairstylist. Gallant was the first hairstylist to be paid to solely style hair by a magazine. He worked with many notable photographers including Richard Avedon (with whom he frequently collaborated earning the pair the nickname \\"Aradon\\") and Irving Penn. He also worked with many supermodels of that era including Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, Veruschka, Margaux Hemingway and Penelope Tree. One of his notable collaborations with Avedon is a 1968 portrait of Twiggy with \\"flying hair\\", a visual gimmick mastered by Gallant. Gallant's work was eventually featured on twenty-six covers of Vogue. Throughout his career, he worked with many celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Warren Beatty, Marisa Berenson, Iman, Mick Jagger, Cher, Sophia Loren, Anjelica Huston and Drew Barrymore. He also worked for many magazines including Vogue, Interview, Playboy and Rolling Stone. In the 1970s, Gallant became a photographer. His main muse was the Dutch model, Apollonia van Ravenstein. In the late 1970s, Gallant succeeded Sari Marks as Staff Photographer for the fashion magazine Ambiance. He also worked with fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg. During this period, Gallant became a fixture in the nightclub scene and frequented Studio 54. His personal style became as well known as his hair styling and photographic work. Gallant wore only black from head to toe, sported chiseled sideburns and frequently lined his eyes with kohl. He also wore high heeled cowboy boots and a Japanese schoolboys' hat which was covered with gold charms. Model Lauren Hutton later said of Gallant, \\"He was the first leather queen in New York City or any place in the world that I had ever seen and I had never seen anyone as unusual as him.\\" Gallant regularly held dinner parties at his West End Avenue apartment attended by his celebrity friends including Anjelica Huston and Jack Nicholson. Gallant's apartment became well known for its unusual and modern decor; all the windows were shuttered, the walls of the living room were painted with black, glossy paint and the white linoleum were made to resemble a river of blood with splashes of red paint. Gallant's mirrored dining room with glass tables was featured in an issue of House & Garden. By the early 1980s, drug use and personal issues had begun to take its toll on Gallant's life and career. He was deeply affected by the murder of his brother and encountered trouble with the IRS for failing to pay income tax. Gallant was forced to sell his West End Avenue apartment. He then decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a career in screenwriting. Later years and death After moving to Los Angeles, Gallant had trouble securing work in the film industry. He began abusing cocaine and eventually entered rehab. After completing rehab, Gallant relapsed and ran out of money. While staying in a Las Vegas hotel in 1990, Gallant committed suicide. In popular culture In 2010, Italian publisher Damiani Editore released Ara Gallant edited by David Wills, a photography book featuring photos showcasing Gallant's work as a hairstylist and portraits Gallant took when he worked as a photographer.

When two oxen went missing, Ryder went looking for them only to be attacked by a California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus) with two cubs when he stopped for a drink at a creek.

Indomitable salmon The sculpture of the Indomitable salmon, installed March 5, 1974 at the Prairie Creek Fish Hatchery, currently outside Buck's of Woodside restaurant in San Mateo County, California. The large wooden salmon sculpture that sits outside Buck's of Woodside restaurant was carved to commemorate a salmon's remarkable return journey to the Prairie Creek Fish Hatchery where it was born. On 2 December 1964, Superintendent Ken Johnson hatchery near Orick, Humboldt County, California found a 2-year-old marked coho salmon swimming in a tank of newborn fish, exactly where he had been raised two years earlier. To reach the tank, he had to travel from the Pacific Ocean up Redwood Creek, turn into Lost Man Creek, run up a ditch, through a culvert under Highway 101, through a storm sewer, and up the hatchery waste water through a drainage pipe, making a 90 degree turn and a vertical jump inside the pipe. Finally, he rammed through an overhead wire mesh screen, probably by jumping, to get into the rearing pond. The fish was rapidly nicknamed Indomitable by the local press. Looking for how he got into the tank, workers found 72 more marked coho jack salmon of the same age class stuck in the flume or drainage pipe on the way to the hatchling pond. The story of Indomitable received massive press coverage, inspired a book, and continues to be cited as one of the amazing feats of animal migration. After the Prairie Creek Hatchery closed in 1992, the original Davis salmon sculpture was sold by the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors and is currently installed outside Buck's of Woodside, by a minor tributary of Bear Gulch Creek. Watershed Bear Creek after it crosses below Mountain Home Road The tributary Dry Creek flows along the west side of Cañada Road and by Buck's of Woodside, before crossing Woodside Road, then under Mountain Home Road (this view) before its confluence with the main stem. The Bear Creek mainstem is formed by the confluence of Bear Gulch Creek and West Union Creek near the intersection of Kings Mountain Road and Highway 84 in Woodside, California. The candelabra pattern of the numerous creeks and gulches that culminate in Bear Creek formed due to the motion of the San Andreas fault. West Union Creek originates in the Phleger Estate, now part of the San Francisco State Fish and Game Refuge. The other Bear Creek tributaries flow through numerous additional public lands including Huddart County Park, Teague Hill Regional Open Space Preserve, and the northern edge of Wunderlich County Park. The Bear Creek watershed drains . Water diverted from the creek at Woodside Diversion Dam and Lower Bear Gulch Creek Diversion Dam is stored in Bear Gulch Reservoir and provides as much about 20% of Woodside's drinking water, rising to 50% in the winter months, with the balance coming from Hetch Hetchy. It also supplies water to residents of Menlo Park, Atherton, and Portola Valley. The Woodside Diversion Damwas built around 1840 as a grist mill and is located within the 1,200-plus acre California Water Service Company watershed, and there is a second diversion taken from the lower portion of Bear Gulch Creek near Manzanita Road in Woodside.The California Water Service purchased the Bear Gulch Water Co. from the University of California in 1936. Precessor water companies include Arroyo de La Presa (1863), Corte Madera Water Co. (1863-1873), Menlo Park Water Company (1873-1889) and Bear Gulch Water Company (1889-1936). Ecology In the Bear Creek sub-basin of the San Francisquito Creek watershed, adult steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) migrate from the Bay to the freshwater streams of Bear, West Union, and Bear Gulch Creeks to spawn. They are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Steelhead smolt spend the first two years of their lives in freshwater, requiring perennial streams, or at least pools, to survive. The anomalously low gradient of the channel of West Union Creek is also related to the fault and creates high quality steelhead habitat, as do the numerous seeps and springs along the fault. The permanent pools created by these seeps and springs are crucial to the survival of steelhead young. In a 2001 report thirty four barriers to trout migration were identified within Bear Creek and its West Union Creek, Bear Gulch, Squealer Gulch, and McGarvey Gulch tributaries. That report identified the culvert for McGarvey Gulch creek at the Richards Road crossing in Huddart County Park as a significant migration barrier for adult and juvenile steelhead and was reconstructed with funds from the State Department of Transportation's San Francisco Bay Salmonid Habitat Restoration Fund.

Design and construction  Basilisk was designed by Oliver Lang to the same lines as the screw sloop Niger and ordered on 23 March 1846 from Woolwich Dockyard. She was laid down in November of the same year and launched on 22 August 1848.  Propulsion  She was fitted with paddlewheels driven by a Miller, Ravenhill & Salkeld two-cylinder oscillating steam engine rated at 400 nominal horsepower and developing .  Armament  Basilisk was fitted with a single 68-pounder (95 cwt) smoothbore muzzle-loading gun on a pivot mount, a single 10-inch (84 cwt) shell gun and four 32-pounder (42 cwt) smoothbore muzzle-loading guns on truck mountings.Winfield (2004), p.161  Propulsion trials  Basilisk, paddle sloop, towing stern-to-stern with Niger, screw sloop She participated in 1849 in trials in the English Channel with the screw sloop Niger. Basilisk had started life as her sister ship when both were designed as sailing sloops, but while Niger received screw propulsion, Basilisk was fitted with paddles. Although previous trials, including a similar comparison between Rattler and Alecto in 1845, had shown that screw propulsion was broadly superior, the 1849 trials pitted two near-identical ships against each other. Since both ships had the same lines and steam engines developing almost identical power, the results confirmed the superiority of screw propulsion over the paddle-wheel once and for all. On 7 April 1853, Basilisk ran aground off Southsea, Hampshire due to a flag being hoisted showing it was safe to enter Portsmouth Naval Base when there was insufficient water to do so. Two or three of her crew were injured. She was later refloated and taken in to Portsmouth.  Crimean War service  After the trials she served in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War in 1854-1855, participating in the blockade of Courland. She attacked and sank 10 Russian transports carrying grain on 14 June 1855 and sank some salt boats on 13 July. She also participated in the action of 17 July in the Gulf of Riga, with against Russian gunboats and shore batteries.  Foreign Service  After the Crimean War, she served on the North America and West Indies Station and afterwards on the China Station and in Japan. In March 1871 she commenced service on the Australia Station. The Basilisk under Captain John Moresby visited the Ellice Islands in July 1872. She undertook hydrographic surveys around New Guinea with Captain Moresby and made a number of discoveries. She was later used for anti-blackbirding operations in the South Pacific. She left the Australia Station in 1874 and returned to England. HMS 'Basilisk', anchored in Threshold Bay, New Guinea, 28 May 1874  Fate  Basilisk was paid off and broken up at Chatham in 1882.

Originally from Beaumont-en-Auge, his father, Adolphe Porée, ran a dyeing factory in Bernay. A very religious individual, Porée embraced the priesthood at the age of twenty-three. In 1871, he became the curé of the collegiate church of Les Andelys. In 1875, he became the curé of Bournainville-Faverolles where he remained fifty-three years. Porée spent his nights studying archeology, with particular attention paid to the churches of Eure sold during the First Empire, local notables and the impact of the French Revolution. Porée, who also was the diocesan archivist, undertook, from 1890 to 1892, an archaeological expedition through France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. In 1882, he discovered, along with the abbé de La Balle and Gaston Le Breton, a lost statue by Pierre Puget on the old La Londe castle grounds at Biéville-Beuville. This statue of Hercules slaying the Hydra of Lerna, which was originally in the Château du Vaudreuil, is now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen. A disciple of Auguste Le Prévost and Leopold Delisle, he was the director of the Société des Antiquaires de Normandie, a corresponding member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and an Officer of Public Instruction. He was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1926. Porée's Histoire de l'Abbaye du Bec is his magnum opus. Several streets were named after him, in Bec-Hellouin, Bournainville-Faverolles, Pont-Audemer and Bernay. In 1964, a plaque honoring his memory was erected in the cemetery of Bournainville. In 2000, a local former rectory (now the Town Hall) was converted into a Porée museum.

Origins=Ancestry The Nadikerianda clan name originated from the words Nadu keri ('Central village') and the suffix anda which means 'belonging to'. Incidentally, Nadikeri is the name of a village in South Kodagu as well. According to a family tree drawn by Nadikerianda Chinnappa himself the earliest remembered ancestors of the clan were Nadikerianda Aiyanna and his wife Mayamma who lived around 1600 CE. This family tree was drawn up in 1918. The most notable legendary members of this clan were Nadikerianda Devayya and Kaaruvanna, the first was a folk ballad hero whose clan was responsible for the Malethirike shrine on top of the Somagiri peak, near the Nadikerianda ancestral house in Karada village. He was cursed by a powerful tantric. Kaaruvanna was his heroic brother who redeemed his spirit. They are considered to be the Kaarana or Kaarona (revered ancestors) of the clan. (Ramachandrachar 4:1994) Birth Nadikerianda Chinnappa was born in 1875 in the village of Karada, Napoklu naad in Coorg (now Kodagu) to Kodava parents Nadikerianda Aiyanna (not to be mistaken for the early ancestor who had the same name) and Pattamada Ponnavva. They had eight children, four daughters and four sons; Chinnappa was the fifth-eldest, he had two elder sisters, two elder brothers (Subbayya and Kaalappa), two younger sisters and one younger brother. His mother was a lady of the Pattamada clan who knew horse-riding. (Ramachandrachar 5:1994) Early life=Education After matriculating in Mercara from the Central High School he did his F.A.(First Year Arts) from Mangalore. In college he was good at sports, especially in Hockey and Cricket, and in studies. He married his deceased brother Subbayya's widow, Nanjavva, in accordance to tradition, in Coorg and worked as a teacher in Mercara Central High School. Career In 1899 he joined the revenue department and became a Senebaayi (Shanbhog or Accountant). That year in September he wrote an English poem, 'My Position as Shanbog', voicing his frustration with his job. The following year he became a Revenue Inspector and in 1902 he joined the Coorg Regiment of the army and rose to become a Subedar- Major. When the regiment was disbanded in 1904 he joined the Police Department, underwent training in Vellore and became a sub-Inspector in Kushalnagar. Thereafter he served in Napoklu, Srimangala and Virajpet for some five or six years each until he was made Prosecuting sub-Inspector and posted in Madikeri. Later he became a Prosecuting Inspector in Coorg. His job in the Police Force required him to travel on horseback to the villages nestled in the valleys and hills of Kodagu. While he went about his duties, he witnessed local festivals and listened to folk-songs that were a part of his culture and was fascinated by them. He feared that these traditions and songs that were handed down orally over the generations would in time be forgotten, because of the dominance of the English language, and influence of the cultures of the neighbouring areas. He got acquainted with several folk-singers and often, when he returned after his day's work, he brought them home on his horse. He asked his wife to feed them and having served them local toddy, he got them to sing the folk-songs they knew, as they beat the dudi (small, hand-held, hourglass-shaped Coorg drum), while he transcribed the words of the songs, late into the night. By the year 1922 he had compiled many folk-songs and gathered enough material on the customs and traditions of Kodavas for his book, which he called the Pattole Palame. He also collected nearly 750 Kodava idioms and proverbs for the book. Pattole Palame=Name ‘Pattole' is derived from patt-pole which means 'silk-like', and 'Palame' means 'lore' or 'stories'. Thus Pattole Palame stands for 'Silken Lore'. There is yet another interpretation of the title. In the olden days, family histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=silk, ole=palm leaf) or 'silken palm leaf' are still preserved in many Kodava Ainmanes (ancestral homes). Palame also referred to the hereditary oral tradition of folk songs and ballads among the Kodavas. Reviews and publication The Pattole Palame, a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. Some British officials who were interested in Indology(C. S. Sooter and C. Hilton Brown) encouraged Chinnappa in his effort and asked some prominent Kodavas – District Magistrate Rao Saheb (later Dewan Bahadur) Ketolira Chengappa, Retd. Mysore Councillor Rao Bahadur Kodanda Madayya and Retd. Assistant Commissioner Kodandera Kuttayya to review his draft book. When these reviewers commended the book, C.S.Sooter, the then Commissioner of Coorg, got the British Government to provide financial assistance to the author to publish it. Kullachanda Karumbayya was the proof examiner for the book. Folksongs Nearly two-thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during Kodava festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as Balo Pat, these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (small, handheld, hourglass-shaped Coorg drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs. In the second edition of Pattole Palame (or 'Silken Lore'), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest, if not the earliest, extensive collection of folklore of any Indian community written in an Indian language by an Indian. The fourth edition of the Pattole Palame was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy. Bhagvathanda Patt In 1929, Chinnappa's translation of the Bhagwat Gita into Kodava thakk, called Bhagvathanda Patt, got published. This was written in the style of the Balopattu (Palame songs) and in a simple manner which could be understood by common people as well. Sri Moola Kanniye  On 1 October 1917, Nadikerianda Chinnappa wrote a patriotic song in Kodava thakk Sri Moola Kanniye ('Primal Goddess'). He called this the Swadesha Priya Keerthana (literally 'Hymn of the love for self-rule') and the 'National Anthem'. This song is dedicated to the Goddess Kaveri, the patron of Kodagu and the Kodavas. One must note that this song was written in the pre- Independence age when the British Raj ruled over India and Indians were being stirred by the call for a sovereign nation ruled by themselves. This song was included in the 'Introduction' of the original version of the Pattole Palame that was released in 1924, but was inadvertently omitted in the second and the third editions, that came out in 1975 and 1995. However, in the fourth (2002) and fifth (2006) editions these omissions were noticed by the grandchildren of Chinnappa, who had been abroad those many years, and hence subsequently included. Chinnappa's family members and relatives sing this song as their daily prayer. Linguistic Survey Between 1913 and 1920 Grierson began the first Linguistic Survey of India. He wanted knowledgeable representatives of various Indian languages to translate a biblical parable into their language and to either sing a song or to narrate a story from their language. Needless to say Nadikerianda Chinnappa, who was well-versed in both English and Kodava thakk (besides Kannada), was chosen as the representative of the Kodava language.(Biddappa:20 1996) In 1922, after narrating the Kodava thakk rendering of the biblical parable 'Prodigal son', Kodava thakk rendering of a biblical passage, in Chinnappa's voice Retrieved 1 December 2012. he sang his own composition, the poem titled The Coorg national anthem: Swadēsi priya kirtane ('Patriot's hymn').Sri Mula Kanniye in the poet's voice. Retrieved 1 December 2012. These gramophone recordings became part of the Linguistic Survey of India collection. (Ramachandrachar 7:1994) A copy of these recordings were kept in the British Library's 'Sound Archives' in London and in the Madras Museum. This was digitised recently by the Linguistics Department of the University of Chicago Rare audios of Raj era (Newspaper article). Retrieved 1 December 2012. Kodava thakk is called Kodaga and it is wrongly identified as being a language of the erstwhile Madras province. The archives don't credit Chinnappa, they simply state that the narrator is unknown. Upon hearing the recording in the Madras museum in the early 1970s, his son, Subbayya, who had known about the recording, recognised his father's voice. Chinnappa's grandson N. S. Nanjappa has since informed the concerned authorities in the University of Chicago about the name of the narrator.  Renaissance Man Nadikerianda Chinnappa was a renaissance man of his times. He was a compiler, poet, translator, army man, police officer, cricket player, historian, singer and philanthropist. Poet Although he was best known for his compilation work, the Pattole Palame, he wrote original work in three languages: Kodava thakk, Kannada and English. Chinnappa was also a well-known Kodava thakk poet, his most famous work being Bhagavanthanda Paat, the translation of the Bhagavad Gita into Kodava thakk in the folksong style. His popular poem Sri Moola Kanniye ('The Primal Goddess'),in Kodava thakk, is called the Kodava anthem. He also wrote a well-known poem in Kannada and it was titled Somagirija Deva, on the deity of the Nadikerianda clan, at the Malethirike shrine. Sportsperson He used to play different sports regularly at the Victoria Club in Virajpet. A very good bowler in the game of cricket, he was a member of the All Coorg XI cricket team. Beside being part of the Coorg XI cricket team and playing field hockey, he also played billiards and tennis at the Victoria Club. Many of the Europeans who frequented the Club would mutter under their breathe upon losing to him. One day he lost his patience during a game of billiards and he broke the stick. This was seen as a very daring thing for a petty officer under the majesty's service to do before the European officers. (Ramachandrachar 11:1994) Philanthropist He was also involved in establishing the Coorg Central Bank and the Coorg Education Fund. As a philanthropist he sponsored the education of many poor and orphaned children in Kodagu. In fact, at any point of time during his employment in the Police Department there used to be around 8–10 students boarding in his Madikeri and Virajpet residences, free of cost. Chinnappa encouraged Boverianda Muthanna, a brilliant student from the neighbouring village of Nariandada, to pursue his higher education by applying to the Coorg Education Fund for financial support. Muttanna studied in Bangalore Central College where he earned a gold medal in English. He joined the College of Engineering, Guindy, in Madras province (now, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu). Later Chinnappa's daughter Gangamma married Muthanna. (Ramachandrachar 10:1994) Legacy Nadikerianda Chinnappa and Appaneravanda Hardas Appachcha Kavi are the two important poets and writers of the Kodava language. These two pioneers were the earliest known to write Kodava thakk in the Kannada script. Nadikerianda Chinnappa is well known for his magnum opus the 'Pattole Palome', a compilation of the folk songs and hymns of the Kodavas. The Kodava language, called the Kodava thakk ('speech of the Kodavas'), is a tongue rather than a written language, spoken in Kodagu (earlier known as Coorg), a district of Karnataka State in South India. Formerly thought of as a Kannada dialect, it is now recognised as a separate Indian language of the Dravidian family. It has a very recent literature dating from the early 20th century. The text of the Pattole Palame was in Kannada and the folksongs, proverbs etc., in it were in Kodava thakk, written using the Kannada script. Nadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it. This work is considered the main literature of the Kodava language. This book is also referred by the Kodava Hindus who seek to clarify ancient traditions. The 119th birth anniversary of Chinnappa was celebrated in 1994 jointly by the Karnataka Janapada (folk) association and the Yakshagana Academy. The Pattole Palame has become the chief text on Kodava customs and traditions for Kodavas. Family Chinnappa had four sons and two daughters but among them his first three sons died, the surviving children were two daughters (Gangamma and Muthamma) and one son (Subbayya). He also had two step children, a boy and a girl (Aiyanna and Bojamma), the children of Nanjavva and his late elder brother Subbayya. Besides these five surviving children he also adopted his widowed sister Chinnavva's daughter Akkamma. His son Subbayya (Mittu), who was a BEd trained teacher, was engaged to marry Neravanda Nanjappa's daughter Ponnamma, who was also a teacher. But before the marriage was to happen, Chinnappa died of cancer, aged 56, on 12 September 1931, only a few months after his retirement from the Police service. Subbayya also wrote poetry and drama. He became the Asst. Education Officer of Coorg, before retirement. He was responsible for starting many High Schools in Coorg. Nadikerianda Subbayya's daughter Nanjamma was married to Gangamma's son Bovverianda Chinnappa. N.S. Ponnappa, the famous cartoonist is Nadikerianda Chinnappa's youngest grandson – son of Subbayya and Ponnamma. Translation In the 1970s, over almost three years, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma and Nanjamma's mother began to copy out in longhand the partially completed rough translation of the Pattole Palame done by Nadikerianda Chinnappa.[5] Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. After retirement from Canada in 1995, the Boverianda Chinnappas settled down in Bangalore and began to realise the author's cherished dream of translating the Pattole Palame into English. While they were searching for copies of the original edition of the Pattole Palame, a ninety-year-old farmer and self- taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth unable to afford the book he had copied out the entire text word by word under the light of a kerosene lamp, after a hard day's work in the rice fields. He gave this notebook to the Boverianda Chinnappas. They also consulted many elders from Kodagu for the meanings of archaic words in the folk-songs and proverbs. Finally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara) and in Dakshinachitra, Chennai. N.S. Ponnappa did the cover painting for the book and illustrated it with beautiful line drawings. ReferencesFurther reading Biddappa, Major Puggera P.

Modern usage In the past, the village elders knew the traditional laws by heart and passed it on orally over the generations. In recent times the Pattole Palame has acted as a reference for Kodavas who sought the ancient law. One known example was when a couple had to be divorced. The law court referred to the Pattole Palame where they read about the 'Kallu-mara Kaipa' tradition and decided to have them separated (Biddappa 1996: viii). The elders of Kodava couples who marry outside Kodagu or even abroad refer to the Pattole Palame in order to follow the customs faithfully.Kodava (Coorg) old man, with son and grandsons in 1875, by J.

It has mostly smooth bark, elliptical to lance-shaped adult leaves but with many juvenile of intermediate leaves in the crown, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus parvula is a tree with a compact crown and that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greyish bark that is shed in long ribbons, often with persistent rough, flaky or fibrous bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, glossy green, elliptical to egg- shaped or lance shaped leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same shade of dull green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole up to long. The crown of mature trees characteristically contains large numbers of juvenile and intermediate leaves. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, about long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from January to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy Small-leaved gum was first formally described in 1909 by Richard Hind Cambage in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. Cambage gave it the name Eucalyptus parvifolia but that name had already been given to a fossil species by John Strong Newberry in 1895 and was therefore a nomen illegitimum. In 1991, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill changed the name to E. parvula. The specific epithet (parvula) is from Latin, meaning \\"very small\\". Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus parvula grassy in grassy woodland in cold, damp places on the Southern Tablelands near Badja Cathcart east of Cooma. Conservation status This eucalypt is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threat to the species is grazing by domestic livestock. Use in horticulture Small-leaved gum has a compact, rounded shaped with branches close to the ground, making it an ideal specimen plant for small gardens. It is suitable for cold, damp situations and relatively resistant to pests and diseases. In cultivation in the UK, it has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Burling helmed for Team Korea's White Tiger Challenge, in the 2011–13 America's Cup World Series in San Francisco in 2012. Olympic classes Burling (right) and Blair Tuke wearing their Olympic gold medals in 2016 Burling with Blair Tuke were Olympic flag bearers for New Zealand at the 2016 Olympics. They were just the 4th New Zealand flagbearers to win a gold medal at the same Olympics. At age 25, Burling was the youngest ever 49er Olympic gold medal skipper. He and Tuke won the 2016 Olympics with two races to spare and by an overall 43 point margin – winning by the most points of any sailing class in the Olympics in over 50 years. At the 2012 London Olympics, Burling (then aged 21) was the youngest 49er sailor. He won the silver medal as helm in the 49er class alongside Blair Tuke.His silver medal was, jointly, New Zealand's 100th Olympic medal. Burling and Tuke are the first sailors to win six 49er class World Championships (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2020). They won all 28 of the major regattas in the 49er between the London Olympics (2012) and the Rio Olympics (2016). The only regatta they did not win in this time was when they finished 3rd in a short 2 day regatta prior to the Olympics. In all the major regattas (Olympics, Worlds, Europeans, World Cup) in 2015 and 2016 they led into the medal races by over 20 points – effectively winning the regattas before the medal race. Burling finished 11th in the 470 class at the 2008 Olympics. At 17 years old (still at school), he was the youngest sailor ever to represent New Zealand at the Olympic Games. Burling was the youngest sailing competitor at the 2008 Olympics and the youngest member of the 2008 New Zealand Olympic team.

Nowy Świat Street in Warsaw Ronald Clarence Jeffery (6 September 1917 – 24 September 2002), also Józef Kawala, Stanisław Jasiński, Sporn and Botkin, was an English soldier and an agent of British and Polish intelligence during World War II. Jeffery was described by the Gestapo as \\"one of the foxiest devils in Europe\\". Biography Ron Jeffery was born on 6 September 1917 in Kent, to an English mother and a New Zealand West Coast miner who settled in England after World War I. Jeffery served as a Lance Corporal in the 6th West Kent BattalionRon Jeffery, Red Runs the Vistula (1985), Nevron Associates Publ., Manurewa, Auckland, and was captured during the Battle of France by the Wehrmacht in 1940 near Doullens. He was transported to the German prisoner of war camp at Szubin in occupied Poland. Later, Jeffery was moved to Ostrzeszów, renamed by Germans to Schildberg, and from there, travelled with other prisoners of war to the camp in Łódź, named Litzmannstadt under occupation. He escaped twice from two camps and finally joined up with Polish underground members in Warsaw. Jeffery spoke three languages; German, French and English. Soon after his capture, he began to develop a basic understanding of the Polish language, which made him very useful to Polish underground fighters. Under forged documents issued under false Polish and German names, Jeffery began to serve as a courier in the Polish underground as a part of several missions to occupied cities such as Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Berlin and Hamburg. He was also a member of selective Kedyw groups (patrole), which carried out executions of Nazi collaborators and traitors sentenced by special underground courts. In beginning of 1944, Jeffery eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London via Oslo and Stockholm with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery later attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. After war After World War II, Jeffery migrated from England to New Zealand where he ran a business. There, he compiled his memoirs, Red Runs the Vistula, published in 1985 in New Zealand and in Poland in 2006. His story was also the inspiration for the documentary movie The Betrayal by New Zealand producer John Anderson in 1996.

The term is often used to refer specifically to the Joslyn Model 1861/1862, which was the first mass-produced breech-loading rifle produced at the Springfield Armory. History Benjamin Franklin Joslyn was known as one of the most interesting gun designers during the U.S. Civil War, but he was known more for his constant clashes with sub-contractors and the Federal Government than he was for the quality of his arms. His disputes with the government lasted long after the Civil War had ended.\\"The Guns That Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848-1898\\" By John Walter In 1855, Joslyn designed a breech-loading carbine. After successful tests, the U.S. Army ordered 50 of these rifles in 1857 in .54 caliber. The Army quickly lost interest in the rifle, but in 1858 the U.S. Navy ordered 500 of these in .58 caliber. Production problems resulted in only 150 to 200 of these rifles being delivered in 1861. In 1861, Joslyn designed a modified version using a metal rimfire cartridge. The Federal Ordnance Department ordered 860 of these carbines, which were delivered in 1862. Most went to units from Ohio. In 1862, Joslyn received an order for 20,000 carbines. Delivery on these weapons started in 1863, but by the time the Civil War came to an end only about half of these had been delivered. In 1865, Joslyn submitted two carbine designs for trial, both based on the Model 1864 carbine. Despite the difficulties between Joslyn and the U.S. Government, an order was placed for 5,000 of these weapons. Springfield Armory produced approximately 3,000 Joslyn rifles before hostilities ended. After the war ended, the U.S. Government canceled all remaining contracts, claiming that the rifles failed to meet specifications. Litigation related to these contracts persisted for many years after the war ended.\\"Rifles of the World\\" By John Walter In 1871, 6,600 carbines as well as 1,600 rifles that had been converted to use the .50-70 Government centerfire cartridge were sold to France for use in the Franco-Prussian War. Many of these were seized by Germany, sold to Belgium and ultimately were converted to shotguns and shipped to Africa. Design and features Close-up view of a Joslyn rifle The Model 1855 used combustible paper cartridges which were ignited by percussion caps. The breech was opened by means of a lever with an attached finger ring that ran along the wrist of the stock. The rifle version had a 30-inch barrel and an overall length of 45 inches. The carbine version had a 22-inch barrel and an overall length of 38 inches. The carbines purchased by the U.S. Army were .54 caliber, and the carbines purchased by the U.S. Navy were .58 caliber. A sword-type bayonet could be attached to the barrel. The Model 1861 used metal rimfire cartridges and had a laterally hinged block called the \\"cap\\" which enveloped the standing breech and could be swung open to the left when the locking catch was released. This design was refined in 1862 with the addition of cam surfaces which improved the cartridge seating and extraction. The Model 1861 was chambered for the .56-56 Spencer rimfire cartridge, and the improved Model 1862 used the .56-52 Spencer rimfire cartridge. The barrels were not designed to accept a bayonet. The Model 1864 featured many small improvements and refinements to the Model 1862 design, and could fire either the .56-52 Spencer rimfire cartridge or a proprietary .54 caliber rimfire cartridge made by Joslyn. The Model 1865 produced at Springfield Armory was based on the Springfield Model 1863 rifle musket, except that it used the Joslyn firing action instead of the Springfield 1863's muzzle-loading caplock system.

Ensto manufactures for example solutions for overhead line- and underground cable networks, luminaires, electric vehicle charging systems, electric heaters, control systems, and enclosing systems. History=1958–1999 In 1958, 28-year-old Ensio Miettinen established an engineering office by the name “Insinööritoimisto Ensio Miettinen” in Porvoo, Finland. The company started by lathing small metal parts. He studied carefully the market, selecting products that did not suit large competitors, and was able to target, without exceptions, some particular market niche with his products. His father had wished that he should be an entrepreneur: “Set up a hotdog stand if you like, but don’t go working for someone else!” Already during his student days starting at the age of 22, Miettinen had managed things at his father’s engineering firm, Puristustuote Oy. There he had noticed that strong demand existed in Finland for the manufacture of small electrical supplies in particular. He also understood that, instead of individual products, he needed to concentrate on electrical systems. In seven years, Ensto grew larger than Miettinen's father’s enterprise. Miettinen led his company by observing the environment – particularly the German market – as well as by reading a lot and taking conscious risks. At best times there were a couple of hundred active patents in his name. He also wrote work-related books together with Esa Saarinen and Risto Harisalo. During the 1970s, the enterprise began its internationalization and expanded its product range: in 1972 Sähkövaruste Ab was acquired; in 1973, subsidiary Ensto Elektriska AB was founded in Sweden; and in 1974, a factory making distribution boards was completed in Mikkeli and a large industrial hall was built in Porvoo. Ensio Miettinen worked as Managing Director of Ensto Group until 1978, when he hired his successor, Esko Kahela. In the 1980s, Ensto extended its operations particularly in the Nordic countries, but also in the Far East. It widened its production into, among other things, airport landing lighting systems, electric heating systems, and industrial ceramics. A new plant was constructed in Porvoo, and industrial robots were taken into use. The heaviest and most monotonous work were automated, while the employees were not dismissed.. Ensto carried out electrification projects in, for instance, Iraq, Peru and Malesia. In 1988, Ensto Group comprised 21 electricity companies, and employed over 1,200 people. Ensto’s plant in Keila, Estonia During the early 1990s depression in Finland, Ensto reacted strongly: they sold the stock exchange shares they owned, froze all investments, cancelled machinery orders but continued with business acquisitions. In 1993, marketing work was carried out particularly in Russia and the Baltic countries. Assembly work was transferred to Estonia and Hungary, and subsidiaries were established in Russia, Poland and Latvia. In 1994, Timo Miettinen became Ensto’s CEO; two years later he switched to membership on the Board of Directors, and his successor, Petteri Walldén, was nominated. 2000-2009 Ensto's electric vehicle charging station in Moscow Ensto had considered listing on the stock exchange during the decade, but gave up the plan in 2001. During the same year, the Miettinen family bought back the shares Sponsor Capital owned (34 per cent) and Seppo Martikainen started as a new CEO. Ensio Miettinen gave up his shares by the year 2002, whereupon the family business switched to the ownership of his four children. He nevertheless retained his membership on the company’s Board of Directors until 2008 and managed a product development manager with whom he coordinated projects to develop an electrical vehicle charging point. Ensto’s corporate structure was clarified from 1997 to 2004 when it became a Group and opened new market areas outside the Nordic region. 40 % of turnover came from Finland and slightly less than 30% from other Nordic countries. In 2005, company's products were sold in 82 countries, with operations in 14 countries. Production units were found in Finland, Estonia, Poland and China. There were three business units and the largest one was electrical equipment and systems for buildings (46% of the sales) and the second largest one was products sold for the powerline builders (about one-third). One-fifth of sales came from enclosures. In 2006, Jukka Koskinen was selected as Ensto’s new CEO. Ensto bought a share of 91 % from French Ocor Group, which specializes in pre- assembled electrical installation systems. Ocor’s systems were used, for example, in the electrification of offices and business premises. In 2007, the turnover of Ensto Group was 233 million euros. The acquisition of Enervent, a Porvoo-based ventilation equipment manufacturer, was finalized in 2009, as well as Estonian IMCO. Enervent’s CEO, Timo Luukkainen started as Ensto's CEO. 2010- In 2010 EM Group Oy had forty subsidiaries, operated in 19 countries and employed 1,700 persons . Ensto bought Novexia in France in 2010, French PGEP in 2012, Finnish Alppilux in 2014. Ensto started a cooperation with Arcteq, which integrated its protection relays with Ensto’s circuit breakers.. In 2016, a French manufacturer of surge protectors for electrical distribution networks, Tridelta Parafoudres as well as a minority interest in Arcteq were purchased . Ari Virtanen started as Ensto’s CEO. In 2017, EM Group, owned by the Miettinen family, was split into three new companies: Tianta, Ensto Invest, and EM Group. In 2018, the majority of the group's ownership was transferred to the third generation, to Ensio Miettinen’s 8 grandchildren. Hannu Keinänen was appointed to the position of Ensto’s CEO in 2019. Organization Ensto’s owner and parent company, Ensto Invest Oy, is owned by the Miettinen family. In 2018, Ensto’s 10 owners were part of Ensto Invest’s Board of Directors. The headquarters of Ensto is in Porvoo, Finland, where the company was founded. In 2019, Ensto employed approximately 1,600 people in 19 countries in Europe, the United States, and Asia, and it had two business areas:: *Ensto Smart Buildings offers electrification, lighting, and EV charging solutions to designers, contractors, construction companies, and real estate owners and facility management. *Ensto Utility Networks offers solutions for network automation, power quality and network monitoring. It also designs and develops the overhead line and underground cable solutions. Business culture Esko Kahela, who worked at Ensto as a manager from 1973 to 1993 is the creator of the so-called “Ensto spirit”, in which the goals of the company and employees match each other. The business culture is based on trust, openness and equality.

The book recounts Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Nazi leader Reinhard Heydrich in Prague during World War II. The novel was awarded the 2010 Prix Goncourt du Premier Roman. Plot The novel follows the history of the operation and the lives of its protagonists—Reinhard Heydrich and his assassins Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. However, it is also interlaced with the author's account of the process of researching and writing the book, his commentary about other literary and media treatments of the subject, and reflections about the extent to which the behavior of real people may of necessity be fictionalised in a historical novel. Title The title is an initialism for Himmlers Hirn heißt Heydrich (\\"Himmler's brain is called Heydrich\\"), a quip about Heydrich said to have circulated in Nazi Germany. The title was suggested by Binet's publisher, Grasset, instead of the \\"too sci-fi\\" working title Opération Anthropoïde. The editor also requested the cut of about twenty pages criticizing Jonathan Littell's Les Bienveillantes, another novel about the SS in World War II that was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 2006. The Millions published the \\"missing pages\\" in 2012. Translations HHhH has been translated into more than twenty languages. The English translation by Sam Taylor was published in the US by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on 24 April 2012 and in the UK by Harvill Secker on 3 May 2012.

It comes against the background of political debate within Europe to rethink copyright in an era where the use of digital content without paying fees to the creators is part of the business model for some of the largest global internet platforms. Interests of content creators and online platform providers collide. The declaration has been written by a group from political party \\"European People's Party (EPP)\\" Rethinking Creative Rights for the Internet age. Committee on Culture, Science and Education Report.Rapporteur: Mr José Luís ARNAUT, Portugal, Group of the European People's Party Gowers Review of Intellectual Property The Declaration focuses on both the exclusive rights and the limitations and exceptions to existing copyright rulings and standards. The Declaration is influenced by the Adelphi Charter, which resulted from a project commissioned by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce, London, UK.  Copyright for Creativity Coalition  The ad-hoc coalition Copyright for Creativity (C4C), based in Brussels (Dilbeek), Belgium, is registered in the official EU Transparency Register in the section In-house lobbyists. The website \\"copyright4creativity.eu\\" refers to a Brussels (Dilbeek) based public affairs and governmental relations firm, and to EU lobbyist Caroline de Cock, owner of this firm, as coordinator. This firm did organise and communicate the EU Hackathon series for Google and mentions the firm as its client, among other clients from industry and trade associations.  The Declaration  The Declaration reads: Copyright for Creativity – A Declaration for Europe \\"Humanity's capacity to generate new ideas and knowledge is its greatest asset. It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development.\\" Adelphi Charter The development of new technologies underpinning the knowledge economy calls for a review of the copyright aquis. Together, we need to create greater incentives to maximise creativity, innovation, education and access to culture, and secure Europe's competitiveness. Exclusive rights stimulate investment and the production of cultural and knowledge based goods. Simultaneously, exceptions* to those rights create a balanced system that allow for the use of creative works to support innovation, creation, competition and the public interest. Well-crafted exceptions can serve both goals: preserving rewards and incentives for creators while also encouraging innovative re-uses that benefit the public. While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy, copyright's exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment. Europe requires a balanced, flexible and harmonised system of exceptions that is in step with the 21st Century knowledge economy. The European Commission took a first step with the publication of the Green Paper, \\"Copyright in the Knowledge Economy.\\" The signatories of this declaration call upon the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States to take this Declaration into account and engage in policy and norm-setting on copyright exceptions to: * Harmonise Exceptions Across Europe. Copyright regulates the flow of consumer as well as knowledge goods in the single market. For European citizens and industry alike, the harmonisation of exceptions is a necessary step to facilitate cross-border trade, and create equality and clarity before the law. * Act as a Spur to Innovation: New technologies make it possible to expand users' access to vast quantities of relevant knowledge and content. Copyright exceptions must support the development and usage of these innovative services, improving European users' access to content. *Support User Creativity and Wider Participation: The Internet has facilitated an unprecedented shift for citizens, from being passive consumers of \\"broadcast\\" culture to active creators and participants. Individual users are increasingly involved in content and knowledge creation. The European copyright framework needs to reflect this new interactivity which encourages creativity, cultural diversity and self-expression. * Ensure Accessibility by all Europeans: Exceptions must balance the protection of the creators' rights with the public interest and must fully support improving access to knowledge and content for people with disabilities – most notably through the use of new technologies. * Support for Education and Research: Information and communication technologies offer new collaborative ways to develop and share educational and research materials. Copyright exceptions that facilitate new technology-based research and education will propel science and learning, and therefore the knowledge economy, exponentially forward. *Facilitate Preservation and Archiving: Digitisation of content is offering new opportunities not only to preserve but also extend the accessibility of Europe's knowledge and cultural heritage with wide-reaching and long-term benefits for society as a whole. The copyright framework must support this. *Ensure Monopoly Rights are Regulated in the Online Environment: Limitations and exceptions act to counterbalance the lack of competition that is created by the granting of monopoly rights in copyright law. In order to protect creativity and innovation we must ensure that these monopoly rights are also regulated in the online environment. *Promote these Principles in International Discussions. The principles and objectives we endorse should not apply only to Europeans – they should be at the centre of the EU's contributions in any discussions in multilateral and bilateral fora it participates in. * Copyright law enable an exclusive right to creators to regulate and control the use of their work as they wish. Limitations and exceptions balance the monopoly right of the creator, in the public interest. For example to promote education and learning, support a free press, deal with market failure etc.  External links Declaration * Copyright for Creativity Declaration Lobby Website News * Manifiesto europeo por un nuevo derecho de author.

Consisting of a number of districts or Zhōu (), the prefecture covered roughly the area of modern-day Changzhi City in south east Shanxi Province. Geography Ancient Chinese sources describe Shangdang as an “upland location in the mountains”.Shiming Chinese dictionary The east and south east areas included the Taihang Mountains on the borders of Hebei and Henan Provinces. In the south west lay Mount Wangwu and the Zhongtiao Mountains. To the west were the Taiyue Mountains () with Mount Wuyun () to the north. King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325-299 BCE) is reported to have said to his son: “Zhao’s territory encompasses Changshan Prefecture (常山郡) and Shangdang Prefecture. To the east lies the State of Yan bordering Donghu lands. In the West there is Loufang Prefecture (楼烦郡) and the Han/Qin border.” History=Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) The earliest written record of Shangdang is towards the end of the Spring and Autumn period (771-426 BCE) in connection with the State of Jin. At the time of Duke Ping of Jin (r. 557-532 BCE), official Xie Hu () appointed Xing Boliu () as Provincial Governor of Jin’s Shangdang Region.Han Feizi  Warring States period (475-221 BCE)  After the Partition of Jin by the states of Wei, Zhao and Han in 403 BCE, each one occupied a portion of Shangdang Prefecture with their respective capitals located in the territory. The area became the front line in the conflict that followed between these three states given its strategic position. Officials responsible for defending these three frontier prefectures were given the title Shŏu (守 literally guardian) and addressed by the honorific title Tai Shŏu () which in time came to mean provincial governor. By 265 BCE only seven warring states remained. In Shangdang, Han possessed the northern districts of Yi () and Qin () as well as half of Lu () and the southern Ze () districts with the other half held by Zhao and Wei. Han territory within Shangdang was the first to suffer hardship at the hands of the State of Qin because of its location on the border with Qin. From the time of King Huiwen of Qin (r. 338-311BCE), Qin’s power grew and the state expanded eastwards across the Yellow River. By the time of King Zhaoxiang of Qin’s reign (306-250 BCE) Qin already effectively controlled the entire western part of Shangdang Prefecture. In 262 Qin attacked Han’s Shangdang Prefecture whereupon records show: “A Han official Feng Ting (冯亭) arrived as an emissary to King Xiaocheng of Zhao and said: ‘Our state cannot defend Shangdang, it has been overrun by Qin. Han wants peace with Zhao and does not desire occupation by Qin. 17 of our cities are willing to pay homage to Zhao, Great King, help our government and people.’ King Xiaocheng was exultant and sent troops to Shangdang.” Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian • Zhao Family Annals (赵世家) As a result, Han’s Shangdang Prefecture thereafter extended the entire length of the western border of the Shangdang Region. Zhao’s control over Shangdang at this early stage in the Warring States period covered Niè (涅) (the northwest of modern-day Wuxiang County), Túnliú (屯留) (the south of modern-day Tunliu County), Zhǎngzĭ (长子) (the south west of modern-day Zhangzi County, Chángpíng (长平) and Xuànshì (泫氏) (both in modern-day Gaoping City) along with Duānshì (端氏) (east of modern-day Qinshui County). This borderline lay north of the Lu District (潞州) with the Nie River (涅水) rising in the north west then flowing south into the turbid waters of the upper Zhang River (漳水). Thereafter the river flowed through the Chang Ping Pass (长平关) into the Lu District before arriving first at Gaoping (高平) then joining up with the Qin River (沁水). All of the conflicts between Han, Zhao and Wei occurred in this area, predominantly in the Túnliú, Niè and Zhǎngzĭ areas with territory frequently changing ownership. For example Zhangzi changed hands at least three times. During the Spring and Autumn period, some scholars suggest that Zhao Xiangzi (襄子) “rushed to Zhangzi” thereafter gaining control of the area for Zhao. Later on, in 370 BCE, Zhao attacked the State of Zheng and thereafter Han, retaking Changzi and showing that by this time Han had retaken control of the area. In 359 BCE, Zheng, by then a Han vassal retook Túnliú, Niè and Zhǎngzĭ. A decade later in 349 BCE Zhao seized territory belonging to Jin in the area of modern-day Qinshui County, Shanxi showing that once more it had returned to Han ownership. Using the nomenclature of Tang dynasty administrative divisions, Han controlled the whole of Yi District (), the western part of Lu District () and a small part of the east of Jin District (). Zhao possessed Yi District () and the larger eastern part of Lu District. Shangdang also contained the Zhao capital Handan. The Battle of Changping which broke the power of Zhao and left Qin the major power in China took place in Shangdang between 262 and 260 BCE. Later history (221 BCE-) After Qin Shi Huang’s 221 BCE unification of China Shangdang became one of the 36 Qin prefectures with control over Changzhi. During the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE-8 CE) Shangdang possessed 14 counties with a total population of 337,766 people divided between 73, 798 households (户hù). In the following Eastern Han dynasty the number of counties decreased to 13 whilst the population dropped to 127, 430 people split amongst 26,222 households. During the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280 CE) the Shangdang seat of government moved to the north of modern-day Changzhi City. By the time of the Western Jin (265-316) the area had been reduced to ten counties with a steep drop in the number of households to only 12,000. The government again moved eastwards to Lu County () to the north of modern-day Lucheng, Changzhi. At the time of the Sixteen Kingdoms (304-439 CE) Shangdang was home in succession to the territories of the Former Zhao, the Former Qin, the Western Yan, the Northern Wei and the Northern Zhou all of whom moved the seat of government until it finally returned to Huguan Town () in modern-day Huguan County. In 578 CE, the first year of Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou the Shangdang region became part of Lu Prefecture (), an area to the south of modern-day Xiangyuan County. After the establishment of the Sui dynasty (581-618 CE) Huguan County was abolished and replaced by Shangdang County (). The Shangdang regional () seat of government moved to the county, taking responsibility for 10 counties and 125,057 households. In the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) Shangdang Prefecture again became Lu Prefecture ending the use of the name although successive generations still governed Shangdang County. Only in 1529 CE during the reign of the Ming Jiajing Emperor did Shangdang County become Changzhi County and the former name cease to officially exist. Shangdang continued to be used as a name for the location since during the Yuan dynasty records show that Liu Futong () led an uprising which crossed the Taihang Mountains and burned Shangdang. The first battle between the Communists and the Kuomintang after World War II, the Shangdang Campaign, was fought in the region of Shangdang.Lew, Christopher R.

The plant is listed as vulnerable in the 1997 IUCN Red List of Plants,1997 IUCN red list of threatened plants, p.746 but as of October 2010 is not listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.http://www.iucnredlist.org/ and search for Xeronema callistemon Etymology The common name of the plant originates from the Poor Knights Islands on which it was discovered. The islands, in turn, were so named because of their similarity in shape to the Poor Knights Pudding – a bread-based dish popular at the time of their discovery by Europeans.James Cook, John Beaglehole, Philip Edwards The journals of Captain Cook, Penguin Classics, 1999 , p. 93 The botanical species name means \\"with a beautiful stamen\\", referring to the prominent red stamens of the plant's flowers. Structure The green stalks of Xeronema callistemon start growing vertically, initially sheathed by overlapping leaves. As the flower emerges, the stalk then turn sideways, growing a red flower raceme with prominent red stamens tipped with orange pollen and resembles a giant bottlebrushHorticultural use of native plants. Specialist plants, Ministry for Culture and Heritage of New Zealand or toothbrush.Barbara Matthews Growing Native Plants, Taylor & Francis, 1979, p. 50 The individual flower tepals are 10–15 mm long, the stamens up to tall, and the length of the brush is usually between and can reach . The plant itself is about tall and wide.Journey to the Poor Knights Islands Habitat Xeronema callistemon growing on one of the Poor Knights Islands Xeronema callistemon usually grows on rhyolite sea cliffs and rocky outcrops and sometimes in forest. It requires much water and is pollinated by birds and butterflies. If its seed falls on a nearby tree, such as Metrosideros excelsa, then it may grow as an epiphyte on it. The species has no obvious natural enemies and is listed as vulnerable because it grows naturally only on two islands. These islands are protected by the New Zealand Government as nature reserves and have a limited access. However, the plant is becoming popular for cultivation in private gardens. A related species, Xeronema moorei, is found on the islands of New Caledonia, 1500 km to the northwest.Jan 16, 2006: Xeronema callistemon Growth Plants grow from fresh falling seeds. Although they germinate easily, it might take 10–15 years for them to grow into the flowering size. They flower between September and December, peaking in October (spring in New Zealand).

Her early experience as a correspondent was gained on The Atlantic City Press. From her immigration to Palestine in 1933 until her death she worked as a journalist for The Palestine Post (later The Jerusalem Post), covering a wide range of international and domestic issues. She died at 43. Dorothy Kahn Bar-Adon Early life and career in the United States Dorothy Bar-Adon (née Kahn) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 2, 1907; she was raised in a Reform Judaism milieu. During her childhood the family moved to the seaside resort of Atlantic City, New Jersey. When she was 16 years old her father died, leaving the family without its main breadwinner. On completing her high school education Bar-Adon went to work as a staff reporter for The Atlantic City Press. Writing under the by-lines Dot Kahn, Dorothy Kahn and Dorothy R. Kahn, Member of the Press Staff or Staff Correspondent, Bar- Adon was employed by the newspaper until her immigration to Palestine in 1933. During her years at the Press Bar-Adon's writing seems to have found favor with her editors: many of her stories were placed on the paper's opening pages and bore her by-line. While much of the paper's national and international news was provided by the Associated Press, Bar-Adon often covered stories of international interest when assigned to interview visitors to Atlantic City who had a connection to issues of the day. Following the 1929 Palestine riots, 1930 saw two events initiated by the authorities of the British Mandate of Palestine which threatened to limit Jewish immigration: the Hope-Simpson report recommended limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine according to the perceived ability of the territory to absorb immigrants. On October 21, 1930 Sidney James Webb, Lord Passfield, Secretary of State for the Colonies, issued a White Paper restricting further land acquisition by Jews, thus slowing Jewish immigration. Page two of the Press’s November 6, 1930 edition features a by-lined article by Bar-Adon headlined \\"Resort Jews Resent British Palestine Edict: Pass Resolutions Condemning Act; Rabbi Neuman and Rev. Mellen Speak.\\" The article describes an interfaith meeting held at a local community center the previous evening to protest the British government's recent issuing of the Second White Paper. Career in Palestine/ Israel In 1933 Bar-Adon left for Palestine after a busy fortnight in New York. Since Mandatory Palestine was part of the British Empire, she spent much of her time in the city on the complicated process of obtaining a visa for Palestine from the British Consulate, as well as in collecting letters of recommendation from people who might be able to assist in smoothing her first steps in Palestine. Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise provided Kahn with letters of introduction to, among others, Henrietta Szold, David Yellin, Irma Lindheim and Gershon Agron of The Palestine Post. In June 1933 Bar-Adon arrived in Tel Aviv; she wrote at length about the young, burgeoning city, then undergoing an influx of Jewish immigrants from Germany who had concluded that the rise of the Nazi Party to power was a threat to be taken seriously. Bar-Adon was not fluent in Hebrew during her first years in Palestine; she thus began to write for the English- language Palestine Post. From her arrival in Palestine in 1933 until 1936 Bar- Adon lived in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while serving as a correspondent for the Post and writing her autobiography Spring Up, O Well, which was published in 1936 by Henry Holt and Co. In spite of perceived dangers concomitant with the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Bar-Adon travelled throughout the countryside and wrote prolifically of the new and not-so-new cooperative villages: the moshav and the kibbutz. She also met and wrote about members of local Arab communities. In 1934 she covered the marriage of Talal of Jordan, father of King Hussein of Jordan. From 1936 until 1938 Bar-Adon lived in Kibbutz Givat Brenner, while also spending time in Jerusalem. In 1938 the Post sent her to Poland, where she investigated and wrote about the place of the Jews as a minority in Eastern Europe. In 1939 Bar-Adon met her future husband, the archaeologist Pessah Bar-Adon. She continued her work as a journalist, both for the Post and free-lance. On August 17, 1940 their only son, Doron, was born. In 1943 the Bar-Adon family moved to the moshav Merhavia, contiguous with Kibbutz Merhavia, where they lived until Dorothy's death. The closeness of the two settlements, as well as her previous experience as a resident of Kibbutz Givat Brenner, enabled Bar-Adon to contrast the two forms of cooperative communities—kibbutz and moshav—from the stance of homemaker and mother. Her writing on the subject is non-partisan, and this at a time when public debate about the various forms of cooperative settlement in Palestine tended to be highly partisan. A journalist on the periphery During the last decade of her life she wrote of daily life in the Jewish cities and villages during World War 2; of the massive immigration of European Jewry to Palestine in the years immediately following the war's end; of the often successful attempts by the British Mandatory authorities to arrest and detain these immigrants in the Displaced Persons camp in Cyprus; of the events leading to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948; of the 1948 Arab- Israeli War; of the war's end and the beginning of the building of a civil state. Bar-Adon continued to cover the central events of the day under the persona of a Jewish, Palestinian/ Israeli housewife residing in the agricultural heartland. Simultaneously, from the same stance, she wrote of daily life in the villages and kibbutzim. In addition to her work as a staff reporter for The Palestine Post Bar Adon was a regular contributor to such journals as The Jewish Advocate, The National Jewish Post, Palestine Review, The Journal of Jewish Life and Letters. She also composed publicity for a broad range of Jewish organizations in Israel and abroad, among them Hadassah, Magen David Adom, Youth Aliyah, the Zionist Organization Youth Department. In July 1950 Bar-Adon became ill. She was found to be suffering from kidney disease, characterized by uremia; at the time such conditions were incurable. She died on August 7, 1950. Dorothy Kahn Bar-Adon is buried in the small cemetery adjoining the village of Merhavia. Bar-Adon's press card  References and bibliography *Bar Adon, Doron.

The economics of English agriculture in the Middle Ages is the economic history of English agriculture from the Norman invasion in 1066, to the death of Henry VII in 1509. England's economy was fundamentally agricultural throughout the period, though even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on an existing system of open fields. Over the next five centuries the English agricultural economy grew but struggled to support the growing population, and then suffered an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. By the end of the period, England would have an economy dominated by rented farms, many controlled by the rising class of the gentry. English agriculture at the time of the Norman Invasion Ploughmen at work with oxen. Agriculture formed the bulk of the English economy at the time of the Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% put to pasture, with 15% covered by woodlands and the remaining 25% predominantly being moorland, fens and heaths.Cantor 1982a, pp17-18. Wheat formed the single most important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breed were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.Dyer, p.25. Manorial system The open field system, central to many medieval English communities. In the century prior to the Norman invasion, England's great estates, owned by the king, bishops, monasteries and thegns, had been slowly broken up as a consequence of inheritance, wills, marriage settlements or church purchases.Dyer, p.27, 29. Most of the smaller landowning nobility lived on their properties and managed their own estates. The pre-Norman landscape had seen a trend away from isolated hamlets and towards larger villages engaged in arable cultivation in a band running north-south across England.Dyer, p.19, 22. These new villages had adopted an open field system in which fields were divided into small strips of land, individually owned, with crops rotated between the field each year and the local woodlands and other common lands carefully managed.Dyer, pp19-21. Agricultural land on a manor was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage and cultivate directly, called demesne land, and the majority of the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants who would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields, or through cash or produce.Bartlett, p.313. Around 6,000 watermills of varying power and efficiency had been built in order to grind flour, freeing up peasant labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.Dyer, p.26. The early English economy was not a subsistence economy and many crops were grown by peasant farmers for sale to the early English towns.Dyer, p.14. The Normans initially did not significantly alter the operation of the manor or the village economy.Douglas, p.310. William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite, creating vast estates in some areas, particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex. The biggest change in the years after the invasion was the rapid reduction in the number of slaves being held in England.Bartlett, p.319; Douglas, p.311. In the 10th century slaves had been very numerous, although their number had begun to diminish as a result of economic and religious pressure.Dyer, p.36-8. Nonetheless, the new Norman aristocracy proved harsh landlords.Douglas, p.312. The wealthier, formerly more independent Anglo-Saxon peasants found themselves rapidly sinking down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree workers, or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor and seek alternative employment. Those Anglo- Saxon nobles who had survived the invasion itself were rapidly assimilated into the Norman elite or economically crushed.Dyer, pp81-2. By 1086 when the Domesday Book was prepared, the Normans owned more than ninety percent of the land.Lindsay, p.279. Just two native Englishmen still had significant landholdings: Thorkill of Arden, who held seventy-one manors in Warwickshire, and Coleswain, who had forty-four manors.Lindsay, p.280. Mid-medieval growth (1100-1290) The 12th and 13th centuries were a period of huge economic growth in England. The population of England rose from around one and a half million in 1086 to around four or five million in 1300, stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe.Cantor 1982a, p.18 suggests an English population of 4 million; Jordan, p.12, suggests 5 million. In contrast to the previous two centuries, England was relatively secure from invasion. Except for the years of the Anarchy, most military conflicts either had only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive. English economic thinking remained conservative, seeing the economy as consisting of three groups: the ordines, those who fought, or the nobility; laboratores, those who worked, in particular the peasantry; and oratores, those who prayed, or the clerics.Burton, p.8. Trade and merchants played little part in this model and were frequently vilified at the start of the period, although increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century.Wood, p.15. The Medieval Warm Period followed the Norman conquest.Bartlett, p.288. Average summer temperatures were higher, and rainfall marginally lower, than in the modern day and there is evidence of vineyards in southern England.Bartlett, p.288-9. English agriculture and the landscape serf at work digging, c. 1170. Agriculture remained by far the most important part of the English economy during the 12th and 13th centuries. There remained a wide variety in English agriculture, influenced by local geography; in areas were grain could not be grown, other resources were exploited instead.Myers, p.55. In the Weald, for example, agriculture centred on grazing animals on the woodland pastures, whilst in the Fens fishing and bird-hunting was supplemented by basket making and peat cutting.Bailey, p.51. In some locations, such as Lincolnshire and Droitwich, salt manufacture was important, including production for the export market.Bailey, p.53. Fishing became an important trade along the English coast, especially in Great Yarmouth and Scarborough, with the herring a particularly popular catch; salted at the coast, it could then be shipped inland or exported to Europe.Bailey, p.53; Keen, p.134. Piracy between competing English fishing fleets was not unknown during the period. Sheep were the most common farm animal in England during the period, their numbers doubling by the 14th century.Bartlett, p.368; Bailey, p.44. Sheep became increasingly widely used for wool, particularly in the Welsh borders, Lincolnshire and the Pennines. Pigs remained popular on holdings because of their ability to scavenge for food. Oxen remained the primary plough animal, with horses used more widely on farms in the south of England towards the end of the 12th century.Bailey, p.44. Rabbits were introduced from France in the 13th century, being farmed for their meat in special warrens.Cantor 1982b, p.83. The underlying productivity of English agriculture remained low, despite the increases in food production. Wheat prices fluctuated heavily year to year, depending on local harvests, with up to a third of the grain being produced in England potentially being for sale, much of it ending up in the growing towns.Bailey, p.44, 48. Development of estate management Sheep, shown here c. 1250, became increasingly important to English agriculture. The Normans retained and reinforced the manorial system with its division between demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour. Landowners could profit from the sales of goods from their demesne lands and a local lord could also expect to receive income from fines and local customs, whilst more powerful nobles profited from their own regional courts and rights.Bartlett, p.315. During the 12th century major landowners tended to rent out their demesne lands for money, motivated by static prices for produce and the chaos of the Anarchy between 1135-53.Postan 1972, p.107. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability.Postan 1972, p.111. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves.Danziger and Gillingham, p.44. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.Danziger and Gillingham, p.45.  Agricultural development  New land was brought into cultivation to meet demand for food, including drained marshes and fens, including Romney Marsh, the Somerset Levels and the Fens; royal forests from the late 12th century onwards; poorer lands in the north, south-west and in Welsh Marches.Cantor 1982a, p.19. The first windmills in England began to appear along the south and east coasts in the 12th century, expanding in number in the 13th, adding to the mechanized power available to the manors.Danziger and Gillingham, p.47. By 1300 it has been estimated that there were more than 10,000 watermills in England, used both for grinding corn and for fulling cloth.Dyer, p.131. Improved ways of running estates began to be circulated and were popularised in Walter de Henley's famous book, Le Dite de Hosebondrie, written around 1280. In some regions and under some landowners investment and innovation increased yields significantly through improved ploughing and fertilisers, particularly in Norfolk where yields eventually equalled later 18th century levels.Bailey, p.44; Dyer, p.128. The role of the Church in agriculture Fountains Abbey, one of the new Cistercian monasteries built in the medieval period with wealth derived from agriculture and trade. The Church in England was a major landowner throughout the medieval period and played an important part in the development of agriculture and rural trade in the first two centuries of Norman rule. The Cistercian order first arrived in England in 1128, establishing around eighty new monastic houses over the next few years; the wealthy Augustinians also established themselves and expanded to occupy around 150 houses, all supported by agricultural estates, many of them in the north of England.Burton, p.55, 69; Dyer, p.114. By the 13th century these and other orders were acquiring new lands and had become major economic players both as landowners and as middlemen in the expanding wool trade.Dyer, p.115. In particular, the Cistercians led the development of the grange system.Dyer, p.156. Granges were separate manors in which the fields were all cultivated by the monastic officials, rather than being divided up between demesne and rented fields, and became known for trialling new agricultural techniques during the period.Dyer, pp156-7. Elsewhere, many monasteries had significant economic impact on the landscape, such as the monks of Glastonbury, responsible for the draining of the Somerset Levels to create new pasture land.Danziger and Gillingham, p.38. The military crusading order of the Knights Templar also held extensive property in England, bringing in around £2,200 per annum by the time of their fall.Forey, p.111, 230; Postan 1972, p.102. It was primarily rural holdings rented out for cash, but also some urban properties in London. Following the dissolution of the Templar order in France by Philip IV of France, Edward II ordered their properties to be seized and passed to the Hospitaller order in 1313, but in practice many properties were taken by local landowners and the Hospital was still attempting to reclaim them twenty-five years later.Forey, p.230. The 12th century also saw a concerted attempt to curtail the remaining rights of unfree peasant workers and to set out their labour rents more explicitly in the form of the English Common Law.Bartlett, p.321. This process resulted in the Magna Carta explicitly authorising feudal landowners to settle law cases concerning feudal labour and fines through their own manorial courts rather than through the royal courts.Danziger and Gillingham, pp41-2. Mid-medieval economic crisis - the Great Famine and the Black Death (1290-1350) The Black Death reached England in 1348 from Europe. The Great Famine of 1315–1317 The Great Famine of 1315 began a number of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a sequence of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of the murrain sickness amongst sheep and oxen between 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism fungi amongst the remaining stocks of wheat.Cantor 1982a, p.20; Aberth, p.14. In the ensuing famine, many people died and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well to have conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations.Aberth, pp13-4. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated.Jordan, p.38, 54; Aberth, p.20. Food prices remained at similar levels for the next decade. Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather.Jordan, p.54. Various factors exacerbated the crisis. Economic growth had already begun to slow significantly in the years prior to the crisis and the English rural population was increasingly under economic stress, with around half the peasantry estimated to possess insufficient land to provide them with a secure livelihood.Jordan, p.12; Bailey, p.46; Aberth, p26-7; Cantor 1982a, p.18; Jordan, p.12. Where additional land was being brought into cultivation, or existing land cultivated more intensively, the soil may have become exhausted and useless.Postan 1972, pp26-7; Aberth, p.26; Cantor 1982a, p.18; Jordan, p.12. Bad weather also played an important part in the disaster; 1315-6 and 1318 saw torrential rains and an incredibly cold winter, which in combination badly impacted on harvests and stored supplies.Aberth, p.34; Jordan, p.17, 19. The rains of these years was followed by draught in the 1320s and another fierce winter in 1321, complicating recovery.Jordan, p.17. Disease, independent of the famine, was also high during the period, striking at the wealthier as well as the poorer classes. The commencement of war with France in 1337 only added to the economic difficulties.Fryde and Fryde, p.754. The Great Famine firmly reversed the population growth of the 12th and 13th centuries and left a domestic economy that was \\"profoundly shaken, but not destroyed\\".Jordan, p.78; Hodgett, p.201. Black Death The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360-2, 1368-9, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter.Dyer, p.271, 274; Hatcher, p.37. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40-70% amongst the peasantry.Dyer, p.272, Hatcher, p.25.The precise mortality figures for the Black Death have debated at length for many years. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether.Dyer, p.274. The medieval authorities did their best to respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense.Dyer, pp272-3. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused.Dyer, p.273. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions.Fryde, p.753. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, the longer term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence.Hatcher, p.61. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture for the remainder of the medieval period.Dyer, p.278. Late medieval economic recovery (1350-1509) The events of the crisis between 1290–1348 and the subsequent epidemics produced many challenges for the English economy. In the decades after the disaster, the economic and social issues arising from the Black Death combined with the costs of the Hundred Years War to produce the Peasants Revolt of 1381.Kowaleski, p.233. Although the revolt was suppressed it undermined many of the vestiges of the feudal economic order and the countryside became dominated by estates organised as farms, frequently owned or rented by the new economic class of the gentry.Hatcher, p.36; Lee, p.127. The English agricultural economy remained depressed throughout the 15th century, with growth coming from the greatly increased English cloth trade and manufacturing.Hatcher, p.36; Lee, p.127. The economic consequences of this varied considerably from region to region, but generally London, the South and the West prospered at the expense of the Eastern and the older cities.Dyer, pp300-1. The role of merchants and of trade became increasingly seen as important to the country and usury became increasingly accepted, with English economic thinking increasingly influenced by Renaissance humanist theories.Wood, p.120, 173. Collapse of the demesne and the creation of the farming system Embleton, County Durham, one of nearly 1,500 medieval villages abandoned after the agrarian crisis of the 14th century. The agricultural sector of the English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century.Fryde and Fryde, p.753; Bailey, pp46-7. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily.Bailey, p.47. England's much smaller population needed less food and the demand for agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult.Hodgett, p.205. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381.Hodgett, p.205. Despite attempts to increase money rents, by the end of the 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.Hodgett, p.206; Bailey, p.46. Noble and church landowners responded in various ways. They began to invest significantly less in agriculture and land was increasingly taken out of production altogether. In some cases entire settlements were abandoned, with nearly 1,500 villages lost during this period.Hodgett, p.206. They also abandoned the system of direct management of their demesne lands, that had begun back in the 1180s, and turned instead to \\"farming\\" out large blocks of land for fixed money rents. Initially livestock and land were rented out together under \\"stock and lease\\" contracts, but this was found to be increasingly impractical and contracts for farms became centred purely on land. As the major estates transformed, a new economic grouping, the gentry, became evident, many of them benefiting from the opportunities of the farming system. Land distribution remained heavily unequal; estimates suggest that the English nobility owned 20% of English lands, the Church and Crown 33%, the gentry 25%, with the remainder owned by peasant farmers.Bailey, p.41. Agriculture itself continued to innovate, and the loss of many English oxen to the murrain sickness in the crisis increased the number of horses being used to plough fields in the 14th century, a significant improvement on older methods.Aberth, p27-8.

It was directed by Tom Hooper, produced by Louis Marks, and was first broadcast in three parts on BBC One from 23 November to 7 December 2002. The serial starred Hugh Dancy as Daniel Deronda, Romola Garai as Gwendolen Harleth, Hugh Bonneville as Henleigh Grandcourt, and Jodhi May as Mirah Lapidoth. Co-production funding came from WGBH Boston. Plot Set in 1870s England, the story involves the overlapping narratives of two characters. Daniel Deronda (Hugh Dancy) is an intelligent and handsome young man of obscure origins who has been raised as part of the family of his loving guardian, Sir Hugo Mallinger (Edward Fox). Gwendolen Harleth (Romola Garai) is a spoiled but very beautiful young woman living with her mother and sisters in an obscure country neighbourhood. She dazzles her neighbours with her beauty and accomplishments and is confident that she will marry a rich man. The likelihood of this increases when she is introduced to a neighbour, Henleigh Grandcourt (Hugh Bonneville), who is heir to Sir Hugo Mallinger. He becomes infatuated with Gwendolen and shows a clear intention to propose; although Gwendolen is not in love with him, she intends to accept. However, on the day of the proposal, Gwendolen meets a woman (Greta Scacchi) who claims to be Grandcourt's mistress and presents three children she claims are his offspring. She tells Gwendolen that she left her husband for Grandcourt and begs Gwendolen not to marry him because it will ruin her children's prospects as his heirs. Horrified by this revelation, Gwendolen promises not to marry Grandcourt and accepts an invitation to travel to Germany with some friends to avoid him. In Germany, Gwendolen captures the attention of Daniel Deronda, making extravagant wagers in a casino. When she returns to her room, she finds a telegram from her mother, informing her that the family is now bankrupt, thanks to bad investments. With no money for the journey home, she pawns a valuable necklace but it is returned to her before she leaves. She realizes the person is Deronda. Once back in England, Gwendolen is desperate to improve her family's circumstances. When Grandcourt arrives, proposing marriage and offering to support her family, she reluctantly accepts. In London, Daniel Deronda rescues a young woman (Jodhi May) trying to drown herself. He takes her to the home of some friends to recover and learns that she is a Jewish singer named Mirah Lapidoth who had run away from her father and in despair, tried to commit suicide. As she recovers, Deronda becomes more interested in her and Judaism. After Gwendolen's marriage, the once docile Grandcourt turns into a controlling and abusive brute intent on crushing Gwendolen's spirit. He openly flaunts the second family he is maintaining. Gwendolen meets Deronda again and the two become friends. Deronda becomes Gwendolen's confidant. Simultaneously he tries to improve Mirah's circumstances, using his position to promote her as a singer, despite antisemitic prejudice prevalent in society. Through him, she is reunited with her long-lost brother, Mordecai (Daniel Evans). Unexpectedly Deronda receives a letter from his mother, the Contessa Maria Alcharisi (Barbara Hershey), requesting to meet him in Genoa. Grandcourt senses the connection between his wife and Deronda and forces Gwendolen to take a Mediterranean cruise with him. Knowing Deronda will be there as well, Gwendolen has them stop in Genoa. Daniel meets his mother, discovering she is a famous Jewish singer. She gave Daniel to one of her admirers, Sir Hugo, so that he could be raised as an English gentleman and not as a Jew. She confesses that she is dying and wished to see him one last time. Daniel is elated to discover he is Jewish and tells his mother that it is not something he could ever be ashamed of. Returning from this encounter, Daniel sees a woman being pulled from the sea and realizes it is Gwendolen. Grandcourt drowned when he was knocked off their sailing boat and Gwendolen was rescued after jumping in after him with a rope. Alone with Deronda in her hotel room, Gwendolen confesses that when Grandcourt went into the water she hesitated to throw the rope, prepared to let him drown. Eventually she jumped in but it was too late. Deronda comforts her and tells her that it does not make her a bad person and she declares that she wants to be with him. Daniel cannot deny his love for Mirah and Sir Hugo reluctantly gives his blessing. He meets Gwendolen, who has returned to live with her family, to tell her the news. Although disappointed, she gives him her best wishes and declares that because of knowing him, she will be a better person in life. Daniel and Mirah marry and sail away.

Built 1856. Demolished 1933. Detroit, Michigan Bela Hubbard (April 23, 1814 – June 13, 1896) was a 19th- century naturalist, geologist, writer, historian, surveyor, explorer, lawyer, real estate dealer, lumberman and civic leader of early Detroit, Michigan. Hubbard is noted as one of the pioneer geologists of Michigan starting with expeditions undertaken, while in his twenties, with Michigan's geologist Douglass Houghton. These early expeditions explored the salt springs of Michigan's Grand and Saginaw river valleys. Later, Hubbard surveyed many of the regions around Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Biography Bela Hubbard, second son of Phebe and Thomas Hill Hubbard was born in Hamilton, N. Y. He graduated at Hamilton College in 1834, and in the spring of 1835 moved to Detroit, Michigan to help manage the family's farm and land agency. Hubbard was quick-deeded ownership of the two-hundred-and-fifty acre Knaggs farm at Springwells on the river southwest of Detroit. It had been purchased by his father the year before. For several years both Bela and Henry Hubbard, an older sibling who had arrived in Detroit the year previous, stayed in the old Knagg's farmhouse. Bela Hubbard used his farm not solely as a means of production but to apply scientific principles towards the advancement of agriculture. In 1837, after the Michigan Legislature established a geological survey to conduct a study of the state's natural resources, the state geologist, Douglass Houghton, appointed Hubbard his assistant. Hubbard served the Geological Survey from 1837 to 1841. Major field work undertaken by Hubbard for the survey included a coast survey of the Lake Huron and Michigan shores of the Lower Peninsula, done with Houghton in 1838; surveys of Wayne and Monroe Counties, also in 1838; and a survey of the Lake Superior coast and the copper region of Keweenaw Point with Houghton, in 1840. After 1840 the work of the Geological Survey was reduced, and Hubbard left the agency. At the conclusion of the State Survey he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1842. In 1843 Houghton proposed that the U.S. land survey of the Upper Peninsula be combined with the state geological survey of the area. The following summer he contracted to perform the combined surveys. After Houghton's death in the fall of 1845, the surveys he had contracted to do were taken over by Hubbard and others. Hubbard surveyed the Huron Mountains area of Marquette and Baraga Counties with William Ives in 1845 and 1846. He also surveyed parts of Houghton and Ontonagon Counties in those years with Sylvester Higgins. Also in 1846 Hubbard edited and published with William Austin Burt a report on the copper region based on Houghton's notes from his 1845 survey. On March 2, 1848 he married Sarah Eliza Baughman of Detroit, daughter of Rev. John A. and Sarah (Harvey) Baughman at Adrian, Michigan. She was 16 years old at the time. Country estates were of considerable interest to Hubbard. He consulted Andrew Jackson Downing's works on the subject and became enamored with the author's philosophy of country living in a romantic villa surrounded by semi-natural parks and gardens. In 1853 Hubbard contracted with famed New York architect Alexander Jackson Davis to design several homes. Davis advised Hubbard to visit Llewellyn Park, a garden suburb that was one of the nation's first planned communities, and to inspect Haskell's Italian villa. These meetings resulted in the Vinewood estates, in which three Italianate homes were built on a rise 1/4 mile above the Detroit River. These were the Baughman-Scotten House, first occupied by Hubbard's in laws and later sold to Daniel Scotten, the Reeve House belonging to lumberman Christopher Reeve, and Vinewood, Hubbard's estate. Vinewood, after having been deeded to Grace Hospital in Detroit in 1913 and made the Miriam Memorial Branch, was demolished in 1933. After 1854 Hubbard gave his chief attention to real estate and the lumber trade. Remaining interested in the agriculture of his adopted State he was made Trustee of the Agricultural Society, which in 1849 drafted a memorial and read by Hubbard to the Michigan legislature, calling for a State Agricultural College and Model Farm which was adopted in 1855 and is now Michigan State University. He was also a Trustee of the State Asylums for the Insane and for the Deaf and Dumb and served as trustee of the Detroit Museum of Art, a precursor to the Detroit Institute of Arts. He donated a significant amount of land to the City of Detroit to serve as the Western Boulevard which is now West Grand Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in the city of Detroit. He was also a strong proponent of the acquisition of Belle Isle by the City of Detroit as a public park. He authored many scientific, literary, and historical papers, and in 1888 published a volume entitled \\"Memorials of a Half Century in Michigan and the Lake Regions.\\" In 1892 he received the honorary degree of LL.D from his alma mater, Hamilton College. There is a residence hall at Michigan State University named in his honor. Hubbard died in 1896, and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit.

Although England's economy was fundamentally agricultural throughout the period, even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on a mature network of well established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the English economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban areas, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England would have a weak early modern government overseeing an economy involving a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations. Invasion and the early Norman period (1066-1100) William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066, defeating the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings and placing the country under Norman rule. This campaign was followed by fierce military operations known as the Harrying of the North between 1069–70, extending Norman authority across the north of England. William's system of government was broadly feudal in that the right to possess land was linked to service to the king, but in many other ways the invasion did little to alter the nature of the English economy.Dyer 2009, p.8. Most of the damage done in the invasion was in the north and the west of England, some of it still recorded as \\"wasteland\\" in 1086.Cantor 1982a, p.18. Many of the key features of the English trading and financial system remained in place in the decades immediately after the conquest. Trade, manufacturing and the towns A page of the Domesday Book, capturing the economic condition of England in 1086. Although primarily rural, England had a number of old, economically important towns in 1066. A large amount of trade came through the Eastern towns, including London, York, Winchester, Lincoln, Norwich, Ipswich and Thetford.Stenton, p.162, 166. Much of this trade was with France, the Low Countries and Germany, but the North-East of England traded with partners as far away as Sweden.Douglas, p.303. Cloth was already being imported to England before the invasion through the mercery trade.Sutton, p.2. Some towns, such as York, suffered from Norman sacking during William's northern campaigns.Douglas, p.313. Other towns saw the widespread demolition of houses to make room for new motte and bailey fortifications, as was the case in Lincoln. The Norman invasion also brought significant economic changes with the arrival of the first Jews to English cities.Douglas, p.314. William I brought over wealthy Jews from the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London, apparently to carry out financial services for the crown.Hillaby, pp16-7. In the years immediately after the invasion, a lot of wealth was drawn out of England in various ways by the Norman rulers and reinvested in Normandy, making William immensely wealthy as an individual ruler.Douglas, pp303-4. The minting of coins was decentralised in the Saxon period; every borough was mandated to have a mint and therefore a centre for trading in bullion.Stenton, p.162. Nonetheless, there was strict royal control over these moneyers and coin dies could only be made in London. William retained this arrangement and also maintained a high coin standard, which led to the use of the term sterling for Norman silver coins. Governance and taxation William I inherited the Anglo-Saxon system in which the king drew his revenues from a mixture of customs; profits from re-minting coinage; fines; profits from his own demesne lands, and the system of English land-based taxation called the geld.Douglas, p.299. William reaffirmed this system, enforcing collection of the geld through his new system of sheriffs and increasing the taxes on trade.Douglas, p.299, 302. William was also famous for commissioning the Domesday Book in 1086, a vast document which attempted to record the economic condition of his new kingdom. Mid-medieval growth (1100-1290) The 12th and 13th centuries were a period of huge economic growth in England. The population of England rose from around one and a half million in 1086 to around four or five million in 1300, stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe.Cantor 1982a, p.18 suggests an English population of 4 million; Jordan, p.12, suggests 5 million. In contrast to the previous two centuries, England was relatively secure from invasion. Except for the years of the Anarchy, most military conflicts either had only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive. English economic thinking remained conservative, seeing the economy as consisting of three groups: the ordines, those who fought, or the nobility; laboratores, those who worked, in particular the peasantry; and oratores, those who prayed, or the clerics.Burton, p.8. Trade and merchants played little part in this model and were frequently vilified at the start of the period, although increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century.Wood, p.15. Trade, manufacturing and the townsGrowth of English towns= The medieval plan for Liverpool, a new English town founded by order of King John in 1207. After the end of the Anarchy, the number of small towns in England began to increase sharply.Astill, p.46. By 1297 a hundred and twenty new towns had established and in 1350, by when the expansion had effectively ceased, there were around 500 towns in England.Hodgett, p.57; Bailey, p.47; Pounds, p.15. Many of these new towns were centrally planned - Richard I created Portsmouth, John founded Liverpool, with Harwich, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, Royston, Baldock, Wokingham, Maidenhead and Reigate following under successive monarchs.Hodgett, p.57. The new towns were usually located with access to trade routes, rather than defence, in mind.Astill, pp48-49. The streets were laid out to make access to the town's market convenient. A growing percentage of England's population lived in urban areas; estimates suggest that this rose from around 5.5% in 1086 to up to 10% in 1377.Pounds, p.80. London held a special status within the English economy. The nobility purchased and consumed many luxury goods and services in the capital, and as early as the 1170s the London markets were providing exotic products such as spices, incense, palm oil, gems, silks, furs and foreign weapons.Nightingale, p.92; Danziger and Gillingham, p.58. London was also an important hub for industrial activity; it had many blacksmiths making a wide range of goods, including decorative ironwork and early clocks.Geddes, pp174-5, p.181. Pewter-working, using English tin and lead, was also widespread in London during the period.Homer, pp57-8. The provincial towns also had a substantial number of trades by the end of the 13th century - a large town like Coventry, for example, contained over three hundred different specialist occupations, and a smaller town such as Durham could support some sixty different professions.Bailey, p.51. The increasing wealth of the nobility and the church was reflected in the widespread building of cathedrals and other prestigious buildings in the larger towns, in turn making use of lead from English mines for roofing.Bailey, p.46; Homer, p.64. Land transport remained much more expensive than river or sea transport during the period.Bartlett, p.361. Many towns in this period, including York, Exeter and Lincoln, were linked to the oceans by navigable rivers and could act as seaports, with Bristol's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade in wine with Gascony by the 13th century, but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time.Bartlett, p.361; Bailey, p.52; Pilkinton p.xvi. Transport remained very costly in comparison to the overall price of products.Hodgett, p.109. By the 13th century, groups of common carriers ran carting businesses, with carting brokers existing in London to link traders and carters.Bartlett, p.363; Hodgett p.109. These used the four major land routes crossing England: Ermine Street, the Fosse Way, Icknield Street and Watling Street. A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network.Bartlett, p.364. In the 13th century, England was still primarily supplying raw materials for export to Europe, rather than finished or processed goods.Hodgett, p.147. There were some exceptions, such as very high quality cloths from Stamford and Lincoln, including the famous \\"Lincoln Scarlet\\" dyed cloth. Despite royal efforts to encourage it, barely any English cloth was being exported by 1347. =Expansion of the money supply= Edward I silver penny from Lincoln; Edward increased the controls on the minting of coins begun under Henry II, creating the Master of the Mint. There was a gradual reduction in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England; under Henry II, only 30 boroughs were still able to use their own moneyers and the tightening of controls continued throughout the 13th century.Stenton, p.169. By the reign of Edward I there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the supply for new coins.Stenton, pp169-170. The amount of money in circulation hugely increased in this period; before the Norman invasion there had been around £50,000 in circulation as coin, but by 1311 this had risen to more than £1m.Bailey, p.49. The physical implication of this growth was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers, being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled.Stenton, p.163. During the 13th Century, nominal wages fluctuated, but the overall trend was flat. As a result of the increase in money supply, prices in general increased significantly over the course of the century. As a result of the price inflation, real wages - one of the stickiest of prices - declined steadily. =Rise of the guilds= The first English guilds emerged during the early 12th century.Ramsay, p.xx. These guilds were fraternities of craftsmen that set out to manage their local affairs including \\"prices, workmanship, the welfare of its workers and the suppression of interlopers and sharp practices\\".Myers, p.68. Amongst these early guilds were the \\"guilds merchants\\", who ran the local markets in towns and represented the merchant community in discussions with the crown. Other early guilds included the \\"craft guilds\\", representing specific trades. By 1130 there were major weavers' guilds in six English towns, as well as a fullers guild in Winchester.Hodgett, p.147; Ramsay, p.xx. Over the coming decades more guilds were created, often becoming increasingly involved in both local and national politics, although the guilds merchants were largely replaced by official groups established by new royal charters.Myers, p.69; Ramsay, p.xx. The craft guilds required relatively stable markets and a relative equality of income and opportunity amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon.Myers, p.69. The first strains were seen in London, where the old guild system began to collapse - more trade was being conducted at a national level, making it hard for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poor craftsmen. As a result, under Edward III many guilds became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance (the management of large amounts of money), leaving the guild structures to represent the interests of the smaller, poorer manufacturers.Myers, p.69; Ramsay, p.xxiii. =Merchants and the development of the charter fairs= The market place at Bridgnorth, one of many medieval English towns to be granted the right to hold fairs, in this case annually on the feast of the Translation of St. Leonard. The period also saw the development of charter fairs in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century.Dyer 2009, p.209. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting for two or three days.Danziger and Gillingham, p.65; Reyerson, p.67. The practice increased in the next century and over 2,200 charters were issued to markets and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270. Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen.Danziger and Gillingham, p.65. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs, again bypassing the usual London merchants.Dyer 2009, p.192; Harding, p.109. Some fairs grew into major international events, falling into a set sequence during the economic year, with the Stamford fair in Lent, St Ives' in Easter, Boston's in July, Winchester's in September and Northampton's in November, with the many smaller fairs falling in-between.Dyer 2009, p.209; Ramsay, p.xxiv; Danziger and Gillingham, p.65. Although not as large as the famous Champagne fairs in France, these English \\"great fairs\\" were still huge events; St Ives' Great Fair, for example, drew merchants from Flanders, Brabant, Norway, Germany and France for a four-week event each year, turning the normally small town into \\"a major commercial emporium\\". The structure of the fairs reflected the importance of foreign merchants in the English economy and by 1273 only one third of the English wool trade was actually controlled by English merchants.Hodgett, p.148. Between 1280-1320 the trade was primarily dominated by Italian merchants, but by the early 14th century German merchants had begun to present serious competition to the Italians. The Germans formed a self-governing alliance of merchants in London called the \\"Hanse of the Steelyard\\" - the eventual Hanseatic League - and their role was confirmed under the Great Charter of 1303, which exempted them from paying the customary tolls for foreign merchants.Hodgett, p.85.\\"Hanse\\" is the old English word for \\"group\\". One response to this was the creation of the Company of the Staple, a group of merchants established in English-held Calais in 1314 with royal approval, who were granted a monopoly on wool sales to Europe.Postan 1972, pp245-7. =Jewish contribution to the English economy= Clifford's Tower in the city of York, a major hub for Jewish economic activity and the site of an early Jewish pogrom in 1190. The Jewish community in England continued to provide essential money lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the usury laws, and grew in the 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen.Hillaby, p.16. The Jewish community spread beyond London to eleven major English cities, primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints, all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority.Hillaby, pp21-2. By the time of the Anarchy and the reign of Stephen, the communities were flourishing and providing financial loans to the king.Hillaby, p.22; Stenton, pp193-4. Under Henry II, the Jewish financial community continued to grow richer still.Stenton, pp193-4. All major towns had Jewish centres and even smaller towns, such as Windsor, saw visits travelling Jewish merchants.Stenton, p.194. Henry II used the Jewish community as \\"instruments for the collection of money for the Crown\\", and placed them under royal protection.Stenton, p.197. The Jewish community at York lent extensively to fund the Cistercian order's acquisition of land and prospered considerably.Hillaby, p.28. Some Jewish merchants grew extremely wealthy, Aaron of Lincoln so much that upon his death a special royal department had to be established to unpick his financial holdings and affairs.Stenton, p.200. By the end of Henry's reign the king ceased to borrow from the Jewish community and instead turned to an aggressive campaign of tallage taxation and fines.Hillaby, p.29; Stenton, p.200. Financial and anti-Semite violence grew under Richard I. After the massacre of the York community in which numerous financial records were destroyed, seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews.Stenton, p.199. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community, imprisoning the wealthier members, including Isaac of Norwich, until a huge, new taillage was paid.Hillaby, p.35. During the Baron's War of 1215-7, the Jews were subjected to fresh anti-Semitic attacks. Henry III restored some order and Jewish money-lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation.Stacey, p.44. The Jewish community became poorer towards the end of the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by Edward I, being largely replaced by foreign merchants. Governance and taxation A medieval carving from Rievaulx Abbey showing of one of the many new windmills established during the 13th century. During the 12th century the Norman kings attempted to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion the king had enjoyed combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially in order to pay for mercenary forces.Lawler and Lawler, p.6. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to an increasing number of exemptions. Instead a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, Henry I created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.Bartlett, p.159; Postan 1972, p.261. Royal revenue streams still proved insufficient and from the middle of the 13th century there was a shift away from the earlier land based tax system towards one based on a mixture of indirect and direct taxation.Hodgett, p.203. At the same time Henry III of England had introduced the practice of consulting with leading nobles on tax issues, leading to the system of the English parliament agreeing on new taxes when required. In 1275, the \\"Great and Ancient Custom\\" began to tax woollen products and hides, with the Great Charter of 1303 imposing additional levies on foreign merchants in England, with the poundage tax introduced in 1347. In 1340, the discredited tallage tax system was finally abolished by Edward III.Brown, Alfred 1989, p.76. In the English towns the burgage tenure for urban properties was established early on in the medieval period, being based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services.Tait, pp102-3. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns, including murage for walls, pavage for streets or pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges.Cooper, p.127. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.Swedberg, p.77. The 12th century also saw a concerted attempt to curtail the remaining rights of unfree peasant workers and to set out their labour rents more explicitly in the form of the English Common Law.Bartlett, p.321. This process resulted in the Magna Carta explicitly authorising feudal landowners to settle law cases concerning feudal labour and fines through their own manorial courts rather than through the royal courts.Danziger and Gillingham, pp41-2. Mid-medieval economic crisis - the Great Famine and the Black Death (1290-1350) The Black Death reached England in 1348 from Europe. Great Famine The Great Famine of 1315 began a number of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a sequence of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of the murrain sickness amongst sheep and oxen between 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism fungi amongst the remaining stocks of wheat.Cantor 1982a, p.20; Aberth, p.14. In the ensuing famine, many people died and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well to have conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations.Aberth, pp13-4. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a mass scale.Richardson, p.32. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated.Jordan, p.38, 54; Aberth, p.20. Food prices remained at similar levels for the next decade. Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather.Jordan, p.54. Various factors exacerbated the crisis. Economic growth had already begun to slow significantly in the years prior to the crisis and the English rural population was increasingly under economic stress, with around half the peasantry estimated to possess insufficient land to provide them with a secure livelihood.Jordan, p.12; Bailey, p.46; Aberth, p26-7; Cantor 1982a, p.18; Jordan, p.12. Where additional land was being brought into cultivation, or existing land cultivated more intensively, the soil may have become exhausted and useless.Postan 1972, pp26-7; Aberth, p.26; Cantor 1982a, p.18; Jordan, p.12. Bad weather also played an important part in the disaster; 1315-6 and 1318 saw torrential rains and an incredibly cold winter, which in combination badly impacted on harvests and stored supplies.Aberth, p.34; Jordan, p.17, 19. The rains of these years was followed by drought in the 1320s and another fierce winter in 1321, complicating recovery.Jordan, p.17. Disease, independent of the famine, was also high during the period, striking at the wealthier as well as the poorer classes. The commencement of war with France in 1337 only added to the economic difficulties.Fryde and Fryde, p.754. The Great Famine firmly reversed the population growth of the 12th and 13th centuries and left a domestic economy that was \\"profoundly shaken, but not destroyed\\".Jordan, p.78; Hodgett, p.201. Black Death The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360-2, 1368-9, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter.Dyer 2009, p.271, 274; Hatcher 1996, p.37. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40-70% amongst the peasantry.Dyer 2009, p.272, Hatcher 1996, p.25.The precise mortality figures for the Black Death have debated at length for many years. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether.Dyer 2009, p.274. The medieval authorities did their best to respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense.Dyer 2009, pp272-3. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused.Dyer 2009, p.273. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions.Fryde, p.753. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence.Hatcher 1996, p.61. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices for the remainder of the medieval period.Dyer 2009, p.278. Late medieval economic recovery (1350–1509) The events of the crisis between 1290 and 1348 and the subsequent epidemics produced many challenges for the English economy. In the decades after the disaster, the economic and social issues arising from the Black Death combined with the costs of the Hundred Years War to produce the Peasants Revolt of 1381.Kowaleski, p. 233. Although the revolt was suppressed, it undermined many of the vestiges of the feudal economic order and the countryside became dominated by estates organised as farms, frequently owned or rented by the new economic class of the gentry. The English agricultural economy remained depressed throughout the 15th century, with growth coming from the greatly increased English cloth trade and manufacturing.Hatcher 1996, p. 36; Lee, p. 127. The economic consequences of this varied considerably from region to region, but generally London, the South and the West prospered at the expense of the Eastern and the older cities.Dyer 2009, pp 300–1. The role of merchants and of trade became increasingly seen as important to the country and usury became increasingly accepted, with English economic thinking increasingly influenced by Renaissance humanist theories.Wood, p. 120, 173. Governance and taxation Richard II meets the rebels calling for economic and political reform during the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Even before the end of the first outbreak of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351.Fryde and Fryde, p.753; Bailey, p.47. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing.Ramsay, p.xxii; Jones, p.14. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation - as much as 70% by the 1370s.Jones, p.15. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to many village communities attempting to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims.Jones, p.17. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363.Jones, p.16. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.Jones, p.16; Woolgar, p.20. The 1370s also saw the government facing difficulties in funding the war with France. The impact of the Hundred Years War on the English economy as a whole remains uncertain; one suggestion is that the high taxation required to pay for the conflict \\"shrunk and depleted\\" the English economy, whilst others have argued for the war having a more modest or even neutral economic impact.Postan 1942, p.10; McFarlane, p.139. The English government clearly found it difficult to pay for its army and from 1377 turned to a new system of poll taxes, aiming to spread the costs of taxation across the entire of English society.Jones, p.21. =Peasants' Revolt of 1381= One result of the economic and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in which widespread rural discontent was followed by invasion of London involving thousands of rebels.Jones, p.2. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents.Jones, pp114-5. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn, with up to 7,000 rebels being executed in the aftermath.Jones, p. 201. As a result of the revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, with 80% of tax revenues drawn from the exports of wool.Jones, p. 207; McFarlane, p. 143. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced in later years.McFarlane, p. 143. As a result, successive monarchs found that their tax revenues were uncertain, with Henry VI enjoying less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century.McFarlane, p.143; Hodgett, p. 204. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of Henry VII.McFarlane, p. 143; Hodgett, p. 204; Fletcher and MacCulloch, pp20-2. Trade, manufacturing and the townsShrinking towns= The percentage of England's population living in towns continued to grow but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly as a consequence of the Black Death, especially in the formerly prosperous east. The importance of England's Eastern ports declined over the period, as trade from London and the South-West increased in relative significance.Bailey, p. 48. Increasingly elaborate road networks were built across England, some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles.Hodgett, p. 110. Nonetheless, it remained cheaper to move goods by water, and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic, and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England. Shipbuilding, particular in the South-West, became a major industry for the first time and investment in trading ships such as cogs was probably the single biggest form of late medieval investment in England.Kowaleski, p. 235. =Rise of the cloth trade= Cog ships were increasingly important to English trade as both exports and imports grew. Cloth manufactured in England increasingly dominated European markets during the 15th and early 16th centuries.Hodgett, p. 142. England exported almost no cloth at all in 1347, but by 1400 around 40,000 clothsA \\"cloth\\" in medieval times was a single piece of woven fabric from a loom of a fixed size; an English broadcloth, for example, was 24 yards long and 1.75 yards wide (22 m by 1.6 m). a year were being exported – the trade reached its first peak in 1447 when exports reached 60,000.Ramsay, p.xxxi. Trade fell slightly during the serious depression of the mid-15th century, but picked up again and reached 130,000 cloths a year by the 1540s. The centres of weaving in England shifted westwards towards the Stour Valley, the West Riding, the Cotswolds and Exeter, away from the former weaving centres in York, Coventry and Norwich.Lee, p. 127. The wool and cloth trade was primarily now being run by English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, between 66 and 75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%, with London managing around 50% of these exports in 1400, and as much as 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540.Hodgett, p.148; Ramsay, p.xxxi; Kowalesk, p.248. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London continued and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, rather than the other way around. Usury grew during the period, with few cases being prosecuted by the authorities.Wood, p. 173. trading house in Southampton, restored to its mid-14th-century appearance. There were some reversals. The attempts of English merchants to break through the Hanseatic league directly into the Baltic markets failed in the domestic political chaos of the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s and 1470s.Postan 1972, p. 219. The wine trade with Gascony fell by half during the war with France, and the eventual loss of the province brought an end to the English domination of the business and temporary disruption to Bristol's prosperity until Spanish wines began to be imported through the city a few years later.Kowaleski, p. 238; Postan 1972, p. 219; Pilkinton, p.xvi. Indeed, the disruption to both the Baltic and the Gascon trade contributed to a sharp reduction in the consumption of furs and wine by the English gentry and nobility during the 15th century.Hatcher 2002, p. 266. There were advances in manufacturing, especially in the South and West. Despite some French attacks, the war created much coastal prosperity thanks to the huge expenditure on ship building during the war, with the South-West also becoming a centre for English piracy against foreign vessels.Kowaleski, p. 235, 252. Metalworking continued to grow and in particular, pewter working which generated exports second only to cloth.Homer, p. 73. By the 15th century pewter working in London was a large industry, with a hundred pewter workers recorded in London alone, and pewter working had also spread from London to eleven major cities across England.Homer, p.68, 70. London goldsmithing remained significant but saw relatively little growth, with around 150 goldsmiths working in London during the period.Homer, p.70. Iron-working continued to expand and in 1509 the first cast iron cannon was made in England.Geddes, p.181. This was reflected in the rapid growth in the number of iron-working guilds, from three in 1300 to fourteen by 1422.Geddes, p.184. The result was a substantial influx of money that in turn encouraged the import of manufactured luxury goods; by 1391 shipments from abroad routinely included \\"ivory, mirrors, paxes, armour, paper..., painted clothes, spectacles, tin images, razors, calamine, treacle, sugar-candy, marking irons, patens..., ox- horns and quantities of wainscot\\".Ramsay, ppxxxi-xxxii. Imported spices now formed a part of almost all noble and gentry diets, with the quantities being consumed varying according to the wealth of the household.Woolgar, p.30. The English government was also importing large quantities of raw materials, including copper, for manufacturing weapons.Ramsay, p.xxxii. Many major landowners tended to focus their efforts on maintaining a single major castle or house rather than the dozens a century before, but these were usually decorated much more luxurious than previously. Major merchants' dwellings, too, were more lavish than in previous years.Kermode, pp 19–21. =Decline of the fair system= Towards the end of the 14th century, the position of fairs had begun to decline. The larger merchants, particularly in London, had begun to establish direct links with the larger landowners such as the nobility and the church; rather than the landowners buying from a chartered fair, they would buy directly from the merchant.Myers, pp 161–4; Raban, p. 50; Barron, p. 78. Meanwhile, the growth of the indigenous England merchant class in the major cities, especially London, gradually crowded out the foreign merchants upon whom the great chartered fairs had largely depended. The crown's control over trade in the towns, especially the emerging newer towns towards the end of the 15th century that lacked central civic government, was increasingly weaker, making chartered status less relevant as more trade occurred from private properties and took place all year around.Dyer 2009, pp 319–20. Nonetheless, the great fairs remained of importance well into the 15th century, as illustrated by their role in exchanging money, regional commerce and in providing choice for individual consumers.Ramsay, p.xxiv.

W. Previte-Orton, The Early History of the House of Savoy, (Cambridge University Press, 1912), 231. whose wife Ermesinde would then have been her mother. Agnes herself was Countess consort of Savoy and possibly Queen consort of Aragon. Life=Possible wife of Ramiro I of Aragon Agnes became a popular name in the House of Poitiers following the marriage of William V, Duke of Aquitaine to Agnes of Burgundy. Three Aquitainian women sharing the name Agnes are known to have married Iberian monarchs, and a fourth Iberian consort also named Agnes has been speculated to have been Aquitainian.Szabolcs de Vajay (1978), \\"Contribution à l'histoire de l'attitude des royaumes pyrénéens dans la Querelle des Investitures : de l'origine de Berthe, reine d'Aragon et de Navarre\\", in Estudios genealógicos, herâldicos y nobiliarios en honor de Vicente de Cademas y Vicent con mótivo del XXV aniversario de la Revista Hidalguia, vol. II, pp. 375-402, at p.396. Ramiro I of Aragon married a second wife named Agnes, who based on the name is believed to be of Aquitainian origins.Detlev Schwennicke, ed., Europäische Stammtafeln, new series, vol. II, pp. 58, 76. The woman's parentage is disputed; she may have been daughter of William VI, Duke of Aquitaine or his half-brother William VII, Duke of Aquitaine. It is believed by some Alfred Richard (1903), Histoire des comtes de Poitou, vol. II, p. 122. that Duke William VI died childless. Likewise, unlike William VII, he was only step-son of Agnes of Burgundy, Duchess of Aquitaine, and hence less likely to name a daughter for her. On the other hand, any child of Duke William VII would have been no older than about six years old at the time of Ramiro's marriage, which could explain the lack of children born to Ramiro and his second wife. Ramiro I died on 8 May 1063 leaving as widow this wife who is not again seen in Aragon. Since this was the year before Agnes, proposed as daughter of William VII, married Peter of Savoy, it allows them to have been the same person, though no direct evidence attests to this. Countess of Savoy In 1064, Agnes married Peter I, Count of Savoy. Three children are assigned to Peter and Agnes: *Agnes (c. 1066 – after 13 March 1110) married Frederick of Montbéliard and had issue *Alix (died after 21 December 1099) married Boniface del Vasto and had issue. *(hypothesized) Bertha (c. 1075 – before 1111) married Peter I of Aragon, a grandson of Ramiro I. The prior marriage of Agnes would have provided the political context for this marriage. Bertha had no known issue. Peter died on July 9, 1078, leaving Agnes a widow. A charter confirms that Agnes, widow of Count Peter was still alive in June 1089.Carutti, D.

Ford Ranger is a nameplate that has been used on several model lines of vehicles sold by Ford. The successor to the Mazda-produced Ford Courier, the Ranger was introduced for 1983 as the first compact pickup truck produced by Ford. In North America, the Ranger is slotted below the F-150 in the Ford light truck range, serving as the smallest Ford pickup truck. In markets where Ford does not market the F-Series/Super Duty trucks, the Ranger is typically the only pickup truck sold by Ford. In the Americas, the model line is currently in its fourth generation, derived from the third generation of the Ranger marketed worldwide since 2011. Initially developed by Ford Australia, the current Ford Ranger T6 is the first version sold as a mid-size pickup truck.  Origin of name  Prior to its use on compact trucks, Ford Motor Company used the Ranger nameplate on three different model lines. The name made its first appearance in 1958 as the Edsel Ranger; serving as the base-trim sedan for the division, the Ranger would be produced through the 1960 model year. Following the demise of Edsel, the Ranger name returned to the Ford division in 1965 as a trim package for F-Series trucks and on the Ford Bronco in 1972; the Ranger served as a mid to top-trim level until 1981. Following the 1981 model year, Ford withdrew the Ranger trim line from its light trucks, largely in anticipation of its 1983 compact pickup truck.  Americas (1983–2012, 2019–present)  For the 1983 model year, Ford introduced the Ranger for the United States and Canada. The first compact pickup truck designed by Ford, the American-produced Ranger replaced imports of the Ford Courier (a rebadged Mazda B1800). Over a 29-year production run, the model line was produced over three generations using a single chassis architecture. The Ranger underwent major redesigns for 1993 and 1998, with mid-cycle updates in 1989 and 2001 (and smaller updates in 2004 and 2006). The Ford Ranger chassis architecture served as the basis for multiple model ranges over its production. The 1984-1990 Ford Bronco II and the 1991-2001 Ford Explorer SUVs shared chassis and body components with the Ranger (shared with the Mazda Navajo and Mercury Mountaineer), with the 2001-2005 Ford Explorer Sport Trac. Ford Bronco II and the 1991-2001 Ford Explorer were derived from the Ranger (alongside the Mazda Navajo and Mercury Mountaineer) alongside the 2001-2005 Ford Explorer Sport Trac. Through the use of rebadging, in North America, Mazda sold the Ranger as the Mazda B-Series from 1994-2009 (the reverse of the original Ford Courier; also the reverse of the Ford Ranger outside North America). On December 22, 2011, the final Ford Ranger produced for North America rolled off the Twin Cities Assembly line, as the final vehicle assembled at the facility.  South America (Ford Argentina)  In 1995, exports of the Ford Ranger began to select Latin and South American countries. To accommodate the demand for the vehicle, in 1998, Ford Argentina commenced local production of the Ranger, introducing a four- door cab not sold in North America. During the 2000s, Rangers produced by Ford Argentina shared a common chassis with North American-produced vehicles (offering a diesel engine to meet local demand). For 2010, the Ranger underwent a major revision of the exterior (not done for North America). Ford Argentina ended production of the compact Ranger following the 2011 model year (slightly before the United States) to expand production of the Ranger T6 mid- size pickup, which remains in production.  Model revival (2019–present)  For the 2019 model year, Ford returned the Ranger to its model range in North America (after an eight-year hiatus); the first example rolled off the assembly line on October 22, 2018. Adapting the global Ranger T6 to accommodate US government regulations, the fourth-generation Ranger is the first version sold in North America as a mid-size pickup truck. Similar in size to the 2001 to 2010 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, the model line is sold as a 2+2 door SuperCab (6-foot bed) and as a 4-door SuperCrew. As of current production, the two-door standard cab is not offered for sale in North America, nor is the Ranger Raptor. The model line is currently produced by Ford at its Michigan Assembly Plant at Wayne, Michigan.

Since 1983, Ford replaced the Courier in North America with the Ranger, while continuing to rebadge Mazda B-series trucks in global markets as the Courier into the 1990s. In 1998, the Ranger nameplate replaced the Courier nameplate, except for Australia and New Zealand where the Courier nameplate continued to be used until 2006. As with the Courier, the international Ranger followed the model development of the Mazda B-series. The first-generation Ranger was produced from 1998 to 2006, while the 2006–2011 second generation Ranger was introduced after the B-Series was replaced by the Mazda BT-50. These versions were sold in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa and several Latin American markets. The globally-marketed Ranger T6 has been produced since 2011. In contrast to previous versions, the T6 was designed by Ford Australia (with the second-generation BT-50 derived from it). After excluded from sale from the United States and Canada since 2011, the Ranger T6 has been marketed in North America since 2019 with several design adaptations and modifications.

During his studies, his tutors in history were Prof. Dr. François-Louis Ganshof, Prof. Dr. Hans Van Werveke and Prof. Dr. Jan Dhondt. In the History of Art, he was taught by Prof. Arch. Dr. Broeder Firmin De Smidt and Prof. Dr. Jozef Duverger, Prof. Dr. Herman Bouchery and Prof. Dr. R. Roggen. In addition, he trained in the physics and chemistry of artworks with Prof. Dr. Eng. Coremans, at UGent. He was also a scientific worker in this speciality for the official founding of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage in Brussels. Even as a young architect he displayed a particular interest in the study, preservation and restoration of mediaeval and post- mediaeval heritage. Later on, he would also be active in contemporary architecture, interior design, furniture, industrial art and industrial design. In his scientific research at UGent, he specialised in mediaeval timber construction and the origins of the gothic style, both religious and secular, in Western Europe. Romanesque Crook of Ename He is generally considered a pioneer for his earliest large-scale city centre excavation for the Middle Ages. For example, he took the initiative and leadership of the extensive archaeological digs at Ename (the ruins of a castrum, of the settlement church and of Ename Abbey) in 1941–1947, and at Gravensteen castle in Ghent in 1951–1954. He also developed and carried out the first large-scale mediaeval city centre research in Antwerp (Het Steen castle, 1952-1953), the Besaen huis and the former Mattestraat in 1955-1957 and the Sint-Walburgis church in 1957-1961). He also produced groundbreaking work with his multidisciplinary publications on the history of industrial art (including the first X-ray examinations of antique furniture in 1952). He applied this technique to the \\"Oxford Chest\\" (also known as the \\"Courtrai Chest\\"). He was always very interested in macro photography in his innovative study of any art object and also as comparative material. This can be seen for example from the entire setup of a project, the collection in three languages: \\"The Glory of Flanders\\" (which was not published). He also used the technique in his passionate study of the \\"Romanesque ivory crook of Ename\\". Publications by A.L.J. Van de Walle: books, periodical publications, catalogues, etc. deal with the history of architecture in Belgium, Romanesque and Gothic heritage, sculpture, tapestry art and other industrial art. Others examine modern artistic events, such as in the area of industrial design, plastic arts, engraving, photography, goldsmithing, etc. At the University of Ghent in his teaching he paid particular attention to applied arts in Western Europe, their techniques and the scientific research methods for which he had established a laboratory. In addition to his scientific publications, he was also active in fields such as urban renewal, as well as what had been close to his heart in earlier days, interior design and furniture art. Apart from being an architect, professor in the history of artand archaeology at UGent, he was also vice-chairman of the Commission for Art Professions and Curator of the Museum of Decorative Arts and Crafts, the current Design Museum Gent(1951–1974), the Saint Peter's Abbey, Ghent, and the Hotel d'Hane- Steenhuyse in Ghent. At the same time, he positioned himself as a 'living educator'. These aspirations were to come together at the three National Exhibitions for Modern Social Furniture, which he organised between 1955 and 1957, in conjunction with the architect Dan Craet and designer Frida Burssens.

Due to the forceful Portuguese conversion and intervention into their rituals, the Deity with all the other purushas had to be shifted from Gavasim to their present respective places. The Saraswats and Daivadnyas who left to the north of Goa, established a temple in the honours of the Goddess and revering her in nine different locations. The present temple along with the kulpurushas is located in Vengulara Redi(Maharashtra). The other Saraswats and Daivadnyas who left to the East of Goa along with their Kulapurushas established a temple dedicated to the Goddess. Today the magnificent temple located in Madkai, is famous for its Navadurga having a tilted head. Legend says that a wealthy Saraswat merchant when placed a flower worth Rs. 1000, the Goddess tilted her head acknowledging the merchant's devotion. A similar legend follows at the Katyayani Baneshwar, a Konkani temple (once located in Benaulim, Goa) now located in Aversa, Karnataka. Here Katyayani too like the Navadurga has a tilted head.As the legend goes a goldsmith belonging to Daivadnya Brahmin community living in the village of Madkai was ordered by temple authorities to fabricate a mask of the Goddess Navdurga. The Goddess appeared in the goldsmith’s dream and told him to make the mask similar to his daughter’s face. The mask was prepared resembling his daughter’s face, but after few days his daughter became weak and died. The goldsmith was very sad because of her death. The Goddess appeared before him once again and told him that she will visit his house once in a year as his daughter. Hence as a tradition goes the same mask of the Goddess is welcomed in the Goldsmith’s house on Karthik Shukla Asthami day every year. This day is celebrated by the Madkaikars(Goldsmith's family) in the same way as a married girl visiting her paternal home. The Navdurgas located in Madkai (Goa), Kundaim (Goa) and Redi (Vengurla - Maharashtra) are considered to be Saraswat Kuldevtas whereas the others are gram devtas or normal Hindu temples. Shri Navadurga Devi, Kanyale, Redi, Tehsil:Vengurla Dist:Sindhudurg,Maharashtra,INDIA The present temple has recently banned entry of foreigners into the temple citing objectionable dressing and conduct as the reason.

Optical fibre is shared by many subscribers in a network known as FTTx in a way that centralises most of the telecommunications equipment, often displacing copper phone lines that connect premises to the phone exchange. Passive optical network (PON) architecture has become a cost-effective way to meet performance demands in access networks, and sometimes also in large optical local networks for \\"Fibre-to-the-desk\\". Passive optical networks are used for the \\"Fibre-to- the-home\\" or \\"Fibre-to-the-premises\\" last mile with splitters that connect each central transmitter to many subscribers. The 10 Gbit/s shared capacity is the downstream speed broadcast to all users connected to the same PON, and the 2.5 Gbit/s upstream speed uses multiplexing techniques to prevent data frames from interfering with each other. Users have a network device that converts optical signals to the signals used in building wiring, such as Ethernet and wired analogue plain old telephone service. XGS-PON is a related technology that can deliver upstream and downstream (symmetrical) speeds of up to 10 Gbit/s (gigabits per second). User applications and demand As demand for network speed continues to grow, so new and faster technologies are spawned from the existing standards. 10G-PON is the next generation ultra-fast capability for G-PON providers, designed to coexist with installed G-PON user equipment on the same network; an example of Nielsen's law predicting demand for data downloads to double every year. The ITU-T completed parts of the standard in 2010. 10G-PON may initially find uses in connecting fibre nodes within multi-tenant units and commercial buildings. Triple play services over IP of video, data and voice are often cited as driving user demand for heavier usage of broadband that justifies PON investment. While RF overlay has been popular in some countries and minimises congestion caused by usage of video services, the convergence of HDTV and IPTV, and the growth in internet cloud services could create demand for bandwidth that exceeds the capacity of gigabit services in future. Teleworking and video conferencing are other applications demanding such triple play capabilities. Examples of bandwidth- intensive applications include IPTV, video-conferencing, interactive video, online interactive gaming, peer-to-peer networking, karaoke-on-demand, IP video surveillance, and cloud applications where remote storage and computing resources provide online service on demand to users with thin-client local systems. Cloud applications could take advantage of in-country content hosting, and 10GPON may encourage explosive development of innovative services that become feasible as users move to faster connections. Business continuity systems may also take advantage of 10GPON to enable cost-effective real-time backup/recovery/replication of critical business systems across multiple sites. Other businesses may just need to connect several sites as a virtual private network, effectively a virtual office, or may have e-commerce services that require business partners to have sufficient connectivity for constant database access. Many of these applications are already growing in both popularity and demand for bandwidth. Standards ITU-T G.987 is the standard for 10G-PON. Asymmetric 10G-PON is specified as XG-PON1: 10 Gbit/s downstream and 2.5 Gbit/s upstream (nominal line rate of 9.95328 Gbit/s downstream and 2.48832 Gbit/s upstream). Symmetric 10G-PON is also proposed as XG-PON2 with 10 Gbit/s upstream, but would require more expensive burst-mode lasers on optical network terminals (ONTs) to deliver the upstream transmission speed. Another symmetric 10G-PON standard is XGS-PON (ITU-T G.9807.1, approved 2016-06-22). Framing is \\"G-PON like\\" but uses different wavelengths from G-PON (using a WDM to separate them)http://conference.vde.com/ecoc-2009/programs/documents/sp_stefandahlfort_ng%20access.pdf so that G-PON subscribers can be upgraded to 10G-PON incrementally while GPON users continue on the original OLT. The G-PON standard is G.984.G.984.1: Gigabit-capable passive optical networks (G-PON): General characteristics This compares to the IEEE 802.3av standard for 10G-EPON based on Ethernet, which has standardised upstream rates of both 1Gbit/s and 10Gbit/s. The 10 Gigabit PON wavelengths (1577 nm down / 1270 nm up) differ from GPON and EPON (1490 nm down /1310 nm up), allowing it to coexist on the same fibre with either of the Gigabit PONs.George, John. \\"PONs Can Keep Pace with Exploding Bandwidth Demand\\" - FTTH Prism: Vol. 7, No. 2, July 2010 retrieved 06 Nov 2010 G.987 ITU-T Recommendation G.987 is a family that defines this access network standard (referred to as XG-PON). It comprises four recommendations: * G.987: 10-Gigabit-capable passive optical network (XG-PON) systems: Definitions, Abbreviations, and Acronyms, 2010. * G.987.1: General requirements of 10G-PON systems (approved 2010-01-13). Includes examples of services, user network interfaces (UNIs) and service node interfaces (SNIs), as well as the principal deployment configurations that are requested by network operators. * G.987.2: Physical media dependent (PMD) layer specification (approved 2010-01-13, updated 2010-10-07). Describes a flexible optical fibre access network representing an evolutionary development from G.984.2, asymmetric only in the current version. * G.987.3: Transmission convergence (TC) specifications (approved 2010-10-07). G.988 There is also a companion ITU-T standard defining a management and control interface for administering optical network units, referred to by the G.987 recommendations. * G.988: ONU management and control interface (OMCI) specification (approved 2010-10-07). ONU equipment The optical network unit (ONU) supplies network services from the PON to customer premises, connecting customer-premises equipment such as a home gateway or office firewall. An optical network terminal (ONT) is an ONU that functions as a demarcation point servicing a single subscriber; e.g., a dwelling or office. ONU devices supply Ethernet and possibly other services to the users, either directly (by bridging) or through a gateway device such as a residential gateway, firewall, and/or router, POTS, CATV signals to buildings wired for RF video, and some may even be compatible with the emerging G.hn home networking standard. The ONU receives the downstream data from the Internet or private networks, and also uses time slots allocated by the OLT to send the upstream traffic in burst-mode. TDMA time slots prevent collisions with upstream traffic from other users sharing the same physical PON. Fibre-to-the-cell site is another emerging application, but has extra synchronisation requirements. A specialised Cellular Backhaul Unit (CBU) can provide PON access for cellular networks. OLT and access nodes The OLT (Optical Line Terminal) connects the PON to aggregated backhaul uplinks, allocates time slots for ONUs and ONTs to transmit upstream data, and transmits shared downstream data in broadcast- mode over the PON to users. Since 10GPON is designed to coexist with GPON devices, migration to a 10GPON capability could be done by upgrading the OLT and then migrating individual ONUs as needed. Normally the OLT is on a card that slots into a chassis at the Central Office (CO), which uses special uplink cards for Ethernet backhaul to the telecommunications provider's network and internet. Uplink cards on access equipment will likely use multiple Ethernet interfaces, although it remains to be seen what uplink speeds manufacturers will offer to support 10GPON access. Locating OLTs in outside plant cabinets may be an option for reach extension as a way to minimise the number of central offices covering low population density areas. ITU and IEEE are planning for convergence of their specifications at the physical layer in 10G that would allow for the shared chips, optics and hardware platforms, thus driving cost reductions for hardware manufacturers.http://www.telecomasia.net/pdf/ZTE/ZTE_101909.pdf Optical distribution network PON Optical Distribution Networks use single mode optical fibre in the outside plant, optical splitters and optical distribution frames, duplexed so that both upstream and downstream share the same fibre on separate wavelengths. 10G-PON is no exception with similar reach to previous standards but supporting a higher split ratio of 128 users per PON, or more using reach extenders/amplifiers. Optical splitters creating a point to multipoint topology are also the same technology as those used by other PON systems. This means any PON network should be upgradable by changing the ONT and OLT terminals at each end, with no change to the fibre itself unless different connectors are chosen. \\"An Optical Distribution Network (ODN) being installed today will likely need to support four or more generations of PON over its expected 30 – 40 year life... The fibre should enable maximum flexibility to support any potential new PON technology, be protected with proven, reliable cabling making it easy to install and reliable, and be joined by advanced, low labor and low loss connectivity. The cost of the ODN materials (fibre, cable, and connectivity) at only about 8% comprises a surprisingly small portion of the total network cost.\\" In an effort to extend the reach with support for 128 splits, the standard supports a range of optical budgets from 29 dB to 31 dB. A draft update to the standard is expected to further extend this to 33 dB and 35 dB budget classifications. A PON with a 35 dB optical budget could span 25 km or more and be shared/split among 128 subscribers. Some ONTs can receive a broad range of optical spectrum from 1480 nm to 1580 nm, so making the 10G-PON downstream signal visible to G-PON receivers. As a result, ONTs must block the unwanted downstream signals with a wavelength blocking filter (WBF), a small passive optical device.

By intra-molecular homologous recombination of the chromosome, eccDNA are formed as well as ERCs. The process for intra-molecular homologous recombination is independent of chromosomal replication. The de novo generated circles had exact multiples of tandem copies of 2-kb fragments from cosmid templates and that the tandem organization was a prerequisite to circle formation. Looping out of organized ribosomal genes in intergenic nontranscribed spacers yielded either large or small repeat circles dependent on large or short repeats of the spacer.  In yeast strains  The Sgs1 gene mutations in yeast mother cells were shown to have accelerated aging, suggesting their function to cellular senescence. ERCs accumulate in old cells and mutations of Sgs1 were found to increase this accumulation, leading to the idea that ERCs lead to shorter lifespan of cells. Vice versa, deletion of Fob1 slows down ERC accumulation and increases lifespan. Accumulated ERCs impair cell proliferation in old cells by interfering with the expression of important cell cycle genes at the G1/S transition and thus delay cell cycle progression . The ERC accumulate in the mother cell during the budding process. Sinclair et al. mentioned a suggested common mechanism between the Sgs1 and WRN genes since they both had age related effects on yeast and human aging respectively. Borghouts et al., resolved the two mechanisms, retrograde response and the increase in cellular content of ERCs, that affected longevity in yeast. They determined that the generation of ERCs negatively influence the life spans of grande (cells with fully functional mitochondria) and petite (cells with dysfunctional mitochondria) yeast strains.  In Xenopus laevis  Circular extrachromosomal DNA are not only found in yeast but other eukaryotic organisms. A regulated formation of eccDNA in preblastua Xenopus embryos has been developed. The population of circular rDNA is decreased in embryos, indicative of the circular rDNA migrating to linear DNA, as was shown in their analysis on 2D gel electrophoresis. The decrease in circular rDNA and the degradation of the amplified rDNA population in early embryo development indicated that the small circular molecules are homologous to the rDNA gene cluster, meaning that an abundance of rDNA sequences are not prone to generating circular chromosomes from random events like breakage of ligation. In retrograde response  Retrograde response or (regulation) is the general term for mitochondrial signaling and broadly defined as the cellular responses to changes in the functional state of the mitochondria. Poole et al. provided a model that resolves the role of retrograde response in lifespan. They depict a process in which ERC production occurs and shortens lifespan in the TAR1 gene.

Named after the River Welland that drains into the Wash on the English east coast, she was the first ship to carry this name in the Royal Navy. Construction She was laid down on 1 October 1902 at the Yarrow shipyard at Poplar and launched on 14 April 1904. She was completed in July 1904. Her original armament was to be the same as the \\"turtleback\\" torpedo boat destroyers that preceded her. In 1906 the Admiralty decided to upgrade the armament by removing five 6-pounder guns and adding three 12-pounder 8 cwt guns. Two would be mounted abeam at the forecastle break and the third gun would be mounted on the quarterdeck. Service After commissioning she was assigned to the East Coast Destroyer Flotilla of the 1st Fleet and based at Harwich. On 27 April 1908 the Eastern Flotilla departed Harwich for live fire and night manoeuvres. During these exercises HMS Attentive rammed and sank HMS Gala then damaged HMS Ribble. In 1909/1910 she was assigned to China Station. On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed that all destroyer classes were to be designated by letters. The ships of the River class were assigned to the E class and after 30 September 1913, she was known as an E-class destroyer and had the letter ‘E’ painted on the hull below the bridge area and on either the fore or aft funnel. In July 1914 she was on the China Station based at Hong Kong tendered to HMS Triumph. She deployed with China Squadron to Tsingtao to blockade the German base. After Japan entered the war on the side of the Entente Powers she returned to Hong Kong. With the fall of Tsingtao and the sinking of the SMS Emden, she was redeployed to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla in the British Mediterranean Fleet in November 1914 accompanying Triumph, to support the Dardanelles Campaign. On 25 April 1915 she was assigned to the 7th Squadron assigned to the Smyrna blockade. 5 July 1915 found her on the Smyrna Patrol enforcing the blockade of the Turkish Coast from Cape Kaba to Latitude 38o30’E, 200 nautical miles including Smyrna. At this time she was based at Port Iero on the island of Lesbos. During March 1917 she provided escort for ships between Malta and Souda. During April 1917 she was in dry dock at Malta for a refit. Following this in May 1917 she was based at Mudros to patrol the Dardanelles. She remained in the Mediterranean until the end of the war. In 1919 she returned to home waters was paid off and laid up in reserve awaiting disposal. On 30 June 1920 she was sold to Thos W Ward of Sheffield for breaking at Preston. She was awarded the battle honour \\"Dardanelles 1915 - 1916\\" for her service.

The company is based in the Grand Opera House, Belfast. Its Artistic Director is Oliver Mears. In his review of the company's first production, Tosca in March 2011, where he notes the enthusiastic response of the first night audience Terry Blain continues by stating that: :[i]n a part of the United Kingdom where opera has suffered constantly over the years from chronic inattention and lack of proper funding, and for long periods has seemed simply an irrelevance, Mears and his team have shown at a stroke that there is hunger for the art-form in an area where historically there has been no coherent or continuous operatic tradition.Blain, \\"A Northern Irish Tosca\\" Early performance history After launching in October 2010, in December 2010 NI Opera collaborated with Barry Douglas and his Camerata Ireland orchestra in a Christmas concert at the Ulster Hall. In February 2011 it co-produced its first NI-wide tour, with Second Movement Opera, a production of The Medium by Gian Carlo Menotti which travelled throughout Northern Ireland. While productions of many of the operas in the standard repertoire have been given, some of the more unusual or rarely performed ones have been included in seasons after early 2011. Every year, the company holds an annual Festival of Voice at Glenarm, County Antrim. Judges and coaches include Iain Burnside, Kathryn Harries of the National Opera Studio, and David Gowland, Artistic Director of the Jette Parker Programme at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. In 2013, a series of recitals from Glenarm were broadcast as part of a BBC Radio 3 recital series. Past recitalists have included Ailish Tynan, Claire Booth, and Stephan Loges. The company's patron is Sean Rafferty. 2011 – 2012 season The company's first major production was Giacomo Puccini's Tosca, in three different historic spaces in Derry in March 2011, featuring Giselle Allen in the title role, with Jesús León as Cavaradossi and Paul Carey Jones as Scarpia. The production won the Irish Times Theatre Award for best opera in February 2012. The season also included a concert featuring Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the winner of the company's inaugural Glenarm vocal competition at the Belfast Festival at Queens, and a touring production of Orpheus in the Underworld, in a new translation by Rory Bremner, and with Nicholas Sharratt in the title role. A co-production with Scottish Opera, it toured Scotland and Northern Ireland in Autumn 2011 before travelling to the Young Vic Theatre in London in December 2011.Christiansen, The Daily Telegraph In March 2012 NI Opera toured a new production of The Turn of the Screw by Benjamin Britten which travelled to the Buxton Festival in July 2012. The cast included Fiona Murphy, Andrew Tortise, Giselle Allen and Yvonne Howard with Nicholas Chalmers conducting. The production was designed by Omagh-born Annemarie Woods, winner of the Ring And European Opera Awards 2011. The production subsequently travelled to Novaya Opera Theatre, Moscow in August 2014. 2012 – 2013 season The 2012–13 season was launched in June 2012 and it included five world premieres of works by Northern Irish composers: Brian Irvine, Deirdre McKay, Conor Mitchell, Ed Bennett and Christopher Norby, together with new libretti by writers including Mark Ravenhill and Frank McGuinness at the new MAC theatre in Belfast, in the company's latest collaboration with the Ulster Orchestra. The production was directed by Rachel O'Riordan and designed by Gary McCann. These new works travelled to the Southbank Centre in London in July 2012. In July 2012 the company produced another opera by Benjamin Britten, Noye's Fludde. This site- specific production was performed in Belfast Zoo in August 2012, before travelling to Beijing as part of the Beijing International Music Festival in October 2012, the first time a production of one of Britten's operas has been to that country. It was performed again at the Shanghai Music in the Summer Air (MISA) Festival in July 2013. In November 2012, Hansel and Gretel travelled to the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, in a first visit to the Republic, in a collaboration with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. It featured renowned tenor Graham Clark and a mainly Irish cast.

Taj Mahal (1963 film) was a commercial hit, but is remembered mostly for its Filmfare award-winning music. Plot It was at the Meena Bazar that Shehzada Khurram first laid eyes on Arjuman Banu. When their eyes met it was love at first sight for both of them. When Queen Noor Jehan, one of the wives of Shahenshah Jehangir, finds out she is enraged, as she wants Khurram to marry her daughter, Ladli Banu, even though Arjuman is her niece. She plots to hold Arjuman as a prisoner in her palace, but in vain; then she attempts to have Khurram sent away to battle - again in vain, as Khurram returns triumphant, and is named 'Shah Jehan'. Then she has her step- son, Saifuddin, arrange to kill Khurram - again in vain. Khurram gets stabbed but with Arjuman's help he recovers, returns home, but does not tell his father, fearing for his health. When Jehangir hears of Arjuman's assistance, he gladly arranges their marriage, while Saifuddin ends up marrying Ladli. Then Khurram is sent away to another kingdom, leaving Noor Jehan to plot against him. When Jehangir falls ill, she takes over the reins, has Khurram declared an intruder and sends her armies to bring him in or alternatively his two sons. Watch as events unfold, which will ultimately lead to the building of one of the seven wonders of the world - The Taj Mahal.
