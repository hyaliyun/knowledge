The town itself was first mentioned in the 11th century in reference to an abbey at the site . The nearby Ch√¢teau de Suscinio was built in the 13th century and fortified in the 15th century. The castle was a favorite spot of the Dukes of Brittany who often came for the hunting in the surrounding region . During the Middle Ages, because of its size the town was divided into seven local divisions, a situation that still exists to some extent. The town officially became a commune during the French Revolution. Birthplace of: Alain-Ren√© Lesage the Author of Gil Blas.

The celebration involves dancing, singing, toasting, and banqueting. The best man and maid of honor are called Witnesses or () in Russian. The ceremony and the ring exchange take place on the first day of the wedding. Despite their seemingly unique matrimonial ceremonies, Russian weddings have adopted some western traditions, including incorporating bridesmaids into the wedding party. Traditional wedding rituals A friend of the bride, who is already married, places the first earring on the bride-to-be. the second must be placed there by the husband of the friend. The two golden rings are a symbol of marriage. It is common to see this image on wedding invitations. Paying the ransom Once the groom arrives at the bride's home, he must pay a ransom for the bride, a term known in Russian as \\"vykup nevesty.\\" This event is meant to be comical and entertaining. First, the groom brings an offering (often money or jewelry) for the bride. At this point, the bride's parents bring out a woman or man (the latter for amusement) who is not the actual bride but is dressed up like one covered in a veil, so the groom cannot see his or her face. When the groom realizes that it is not his bride, he asks for his love, but the bride's family will demand a more significant ransom to be paid. Upon satisfaction with the ransom given, the bride's family gives away the bride to the groom. Traditional ceremony Christian wedding in Russia The bride and groom have the option to have a traditional ceremony in a church. In Russian, it is called the venchanie. The wedding ceremony takes place in a church and is divided into two parts: the Betrothal and the Crowning. The service traditionally takes place in the morning after the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, during which the wedding rings were blessed by being placed on the Holy Table (altar). =Betrothal= While the betrothal used to be blessed at the beginning of the engagement, it is now commonly done at the same ceremony as the wedding itself. The bride and groom stand inside the entrance of the church and the priest blesses them and gives them lighted candles which they will hold throughout the ceremony. The deacon leads an ektenia (litany) with special petitions for the couple. The priest then says two brief prayers for the couple and the rings are blessed and placed on the couple's right hand. The priest then says a prayer blessing the couple's betrothal which mentions instances in the Bible where rings are used and relates those instances to the betrothal. =Crowning= In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Holy Matrimony is considered a Sacred Mystery and the sign of the marriage is not the exchange of rings (that takes place at the betrothal) but rather the placing of crowns on the heads of the bride and groom. For this reason, the ceremony of the wedding is referred to as the Crowning. The priest leads the couple into the center of the church where they come to stand on a piece of new, rose-colored fabric, symbolizing their entry into a new life. The bride and groom each publicly professes that they are marrying of their own free will and that they have not promised themselves to another. After an ektenia and several longer prayers, the priest places crowns on the heads of the bride and the groom. These are usually held over their heads by members of the wedding party. Following that are readings from the Epistle and Gospel, ektenias, brief prayers and the sharing of a \\"common cup\\" of wine by the bride and groom. A procession then takes place during which the priest wraps his epitrachelion (stole) around the joined hands of the bride and groom and leads them (followed by their attendants who are holding the crowns) three times around an analogion on which the Gospel Book has been placed. This procession symbolizes the pilgrimage of their wedded life together. It used to be the custom that the bride and groom would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, but now the removal of the crowns is customarily done at the end of the service. The priest says benedictions for the bride and groom and then the dismissal takes place. Civil ceremony Following the traditional ceremony, the couple must have a civil ceremony called rospis v zagse. This ceremony takes place at the department of public services, formally known as ZAGS. At ZAGS the couple is greeted by family members with bread and salt. The ceremony ranges from 15 to 30 minutes and during this time the rings are exchanged and the couple is pronounced husband and wife. During the civil ceremony, the parents offer the married couple two crystal glasses, which they are asked to break. The more pieces or shards of glass they create, the greater the number of years of happiness they will spend together. It is also customary for the married couple to release either balloons or, more preferred, two white doves to symbolize their love and partnership which is written in the sky for all to see. The bride also releases another balloon with her maiden name written on it. Tour of the city Wedding couple at war memorial Following the civil ceremony, the newlyweds and their witnesses travel around the city in a limousine and tour many historical sites. There are times when close friends join them as well. This presents the primary opportunity for the majority of the wedding photographs that are taken at varying historical places around the town or city. Reception After touring the city for several hours, the couple meets the guests for the reception. * The first toast is made to the newlyweds and after the first shot the guests begin to shout Gorko, Gorko, Gorko (Gorko means ‚Äúbitter‚Äù). At this point the couple must kiss for a long time to take out the bitter taste of the champagne (or vodka). * The second toast is made to the parents. * The new couple dances the first dance of the night. * As the night continues the guests dance, sing, play games and make toasts. * For the next several days the family continues to eat, drink, and celebrate. * It is traditional to have an entertainer, in Russian tamada, who organizes games, dancing, and ensures the guests get to know each other and are looked after.

It is the birthplace of the mariner Joshua Slocum and of Clara Belle Marshall, the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.  Geography  Mount Hanley in Winter Mount Hanley is located about nine kilometers northwest of the town of Middleton. Mount Hanley occupies the north slope of the North Mountain facing the Bay of Fundy at an elevation of 150 metres above sea level. History The community was settled about 1784 mostly by United Empire Loyalists and is thought to be named after Rev. Thomas Hanley Chipman, a leader of the surrounding Wilmot Township. The name is recorded in various sources as Handely, Hanly, and Handly. In the 19th century the community‚Äôs farms and sawmills prospered, finding ready markets for their goods shipping from the nearby harbours on the Bay of Fundy at Cottage Cove and Port George. The community at one time boasted sawmills, blacksmiths, a grist mill, a cheese factory, blacksmiths, a general store and a post office (1870-1957) At its peak, the village was once described as the \\"most prosperous and populous in Wilmot Township.\\"Parker p. 162 Some agriculture and forestry remain today although most residents work at jobs in the Annapolis Valley or are retired. The population, estimated today at 20 people, is small enough compared to its past that some have identified it as a virtual ghost town.Parker p. 161 Joe Banks, part-time epigrapher found a stone with markings in Mount Hanley that he believes are Ogam script and dates from the 5th century AD, evidence he claims of an ancient Irish settlement in Mount Hanley. However archaeologists believe it to be only a toppled property marker and identify the markings as scrapes from plow blades. Landmarks Mount Hanley Schoolhouse An original log school built in 1784 was replaced in 1850 and served until 1963 when rural schools were consolidated. The school is now the Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum and is a provincially registered heritage property, noted as being an early example of architecture based on John William Dawson's pamphlet \\"School architecture - abridged from Barnard's School architecture.\\" A Baptist church built in 1861 still sees seasonal services. Mount Hanley shares close links with the adjacent North Mountain communities of Outram, Port George and Moshers Corner and the four communities share a Recreational Centre at Port George. Notable residents Mount Hanley was the birthplace on February 20, 1844 of Joshua Slocum, the mariner who was the first to sail solo around the world and wrote the classic book Sailing Alone Around the World. Slocum learned to read and write at Mount Hanley School where today his origins are commemorated by a plaque and displays at the Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum. While at Mount Hanley, Slocum had his first experiences on the water on short schooner voyages from the nearby coves of Cottage Cove and Port George. He left Mount Hanley when he was eight years old when his family moved to Brier Island. Mount Hanley is also the birthplace of Clara Belle Marshall, the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879. The English-born singer and actor Noel Harrison lived in there in the 1970s and named his 1979 album Mount Hanley Song after the community.

The author of the book, Reymundo Sanchez, was a lost boy - disowned by a physically abusive mother and step-father and sent to live with a step- brother who could not care less whether he came home or not. He soon learned that survival on the streets depends on whom he counted on among his friends and to which gang he belonged. Initiated into the Latin Kings by performing his first hit at the age of 14, Lil Loco, as he became known, quickly earned a reputation for violence, rape, attempted murder, drug dealing, gangbanging, and living up to his name...Lil' Crazy. For ten years a 30-block area of Chicago defined his reality. Lil Loco, still as a child, a minor, then a seasoned gangbanger, broke every rule in the book. Even snitching on rivals, in his own words \\"we told them almost everybody was there, then pointed out the rival gangs triggermen to the police, who threw them in the van. It was just another day in the 'hood\\". This was when the same police would throw him out of a police car in the middle of rival gang territory, to be either killed or beaten severely. Lil Loco was inducted into his gang by a timed \\"beat down\\", and once inducted, any perceived breach of the gang's ever-changing laws resulted in a \\"violation\\", or punishment by the gang. Needless to say, Lil Loco gained his respect by enduring many of these punishments. My Bloody Life is the story of Lil Loco's odyssey through the ranks of the Latin Kings, one of America's largest and most violent Latino gangs, and the insanity, and the heartache that came with it.

He was a member of the publishing syndicates that issued the First Folio and Second Folio collections of Shakespeare's plays, in 1623 and 1632.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 39, 170-1. Career The publisher was the son of a William Aspley of Royston, Cambridgeshire; he served a nine-year apprenticeship under George Bishop that started at Christmas 1587. Aspley's professional career was notable for its longevity: he became a \\"freeman\\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 4 April 1597,Joseph Ames, Typographical Antiquities, 3rd edition, London, 1790; pp. 1384-5. and remained active for the next four decades. He served in the office of Master of the Company in 1640, the year he died. His shops were located 1) at the sign of the Tiger's Head, and 2) at the sign of the Parrot, both in St. Paul's Churchyard. (The Parrot was on the same block as the shop of First Folio colleague Edward Blount, at the sign of the Black Bear.) Shakespeare Aspley's connection with the Shakespeare canon began in 1600: on 23 August that year, he and fellow stationer Andrew Wise entered into the Stationers' Register the plays Henry IV, Part 2 and Much Ado About Nothing, so establishing their right to publish the works. Both plays were issued in individual quartos before the end of 1600, editions printed for Wise and Aspley by Valentine Simmes.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 485.Halliday, pp. 215, 326-7. Neither play appears to have been a major success in printed form, since neither was reprinted prior to its inclusion in the First Folio in 1623. Aspley had another, minor link to Shakespeare: some copies of Thomas Thorpe's first edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets (1609) read \\"to be sold by William Aspley\\" on their title pages. Yet it was his possession of the copyrights to two Shakespearean plays that won him inclusion in the First Folio syndicate. At the start of the 17th century's third decade, when Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard were preparing to publish the First Folio, they needed to obtain the rights to eighteen Shakespearean plays already in print. (They had trouble getting the rights to Troilus and Cressida, and stuck that play into the First Folio late and unpaginated.)Halliday, p. 502.

Biography As a young boy, Toguchi learned the basic techniques of Okinawan Te from his father. In 1930, at the age of 15, he began his lifelong study of G≈çj≈´-ry≈´ karate at the dojo of Sek≈ç Higa and later under Chojun Miyagi as one of his principal students. He studied under Higa for over 33 years and under Miyagi for more than 25 years, making his karate education unique. Toguchi was fortunate as Miyagi was a personal friend of Toguchi's father and so paid many visits to the family. At these times the conversation nearly always turned to karate and the discussions would go on till the early hours of the morning. Toguchi continued his full-time study of karate until the beginning of World War II, when he was drafted into the army as an electrical engineer and stationed in Sumatra, Indonesia. In 1946 he returned to Okinawa to find a devastated people and homeland. Miyagi had lost three children and one of his senior students, Jinan Shinsato. Higa had lost his wife. Miyagi began teaching at the police academy and Higa moved in with Toguchi. At this time Higa also played matchmaker and introduced Toguchi to a young girl named Haruko, soon to be his wife. In 1949, with the help of Toguchi, Higa opened up a new dojo and Toguchi was appointed Shihan. Before his death, Miyagi passed on all his advanced kata and teachings to Toguchi, one of the more important being kaisai no genri. This teaching explains how to unlock the hidden techniques of the koryu kata. In 1953, after the death of Miyagi, his senior students formed the Karate-Do Goju Association with Meitoku Yagi as chairman and Seikichi Toguchi as Vice Chairman.  Establishment of Shorei-kan  In 1954 Toguchi opened up the first Shorei-kan dojo (House of politeness and respect) in Koza City, Okinawa. The Shorei-kan dojo was very close to the American military base (Kadena Air Base) and the Americans showed a great interest in the martial arts. With an increasing western population in his dojo, Toguchi found it necessary to devise a progressive teaching method to overcome the language barrier. Expanding on Miyagi's vision, Toguchi further developed a system of progressive kata and added bunkai and kiso kumite to help explain application of the kata. Many of the early pioneers of Okinawan karate in the US studied with Toguchi. In 1956 the Okinawan Karate-Do Federation was formed and Toguchi was installed as a member of the board of directors. By 1960 Toguchi decided to move to mainland Japan to spread the art of karate and Shorei-kan. During the coming years he would move between Okinawa in the winter and Tokyo in the summer. He first practiced outdoors at the Hikawa Shrine where he developed the kata Hakutsuru No Mai. In 1962 the first Shorei-kan dojo was opened in Tokyo in Meguro Borough and in 1966 Shorei-kan Hombu Dojo Tokyo was built with the help of Tamano Construction (founded by Toshio Tamano's father). Although there were Shorei-kan students and instructors already in the US, such as Jay Trombley in Texas, Shoichi Yamamoto of the University of Kansas and John Roseberry in Nebraska, Toguchi sent Ichiro Takahata to the US in 1968 as the representative of Shorei-kan and to establish a USA headquarters. Robert L Willingham and Bill Mays were of great assistance in helping the Oklahoma Shoreikan Goju Ryu style become established in Oklahoma and the region. In 1969 Akira Kawakami travelled to New York City and joined Thomas Bodie at his uptown dojo and later moved to Oklahoma. That same year Toshio Tamano also came to New York City and it was decided then that the USA headquarters would be established with him in New York. Kow Loon Ong was instrumental in helping the headquarters get started. In 1972 Toguchi sent Tomoaki Koyabu to Canada to teach Shoreikan. Over the following years Toguchi and his wife Haruko Toguchi traveled numerous times to both Canada and the US. Later on Tamano moved to Milan, Italy to spread Shorei-kan throughout Europe and Scott Lenzi is now the representative of the U.S. and South America. Vic Hargitt is the representative for Canada. Haribabu represents Asia and Vahitha Haribabu represents India. Vic Hargitt was the last person to receive the Shihan title from Toguchi in June 1997 and was also the last person to be given certification by a member of the Toguchi family. This was for the rank of Rokudan, July 2004. Death Toguchi died at the age of 81. He was the last living Okinawan to receive the title of bushi, a title also held by his teacher, Chojun Miyagi.

In a door, usually for apartments or hotel rooms, a peephole enables to see outside without opening the door. Glass peepholes are often fitted with a fisheye lens to allow a wider field of view from the inside. Peephole Is One Way Viewer Popular Science, July 1950, pg 153, right-side.  Preventing inside viewability  Simple peepholes may allow people outside to see inside. A fisheye lens offers little visibility from the outside, but that can be defeated using a peephole reverser. Some peepholes have a shutter that falls down on the hole when nobody inside is holding it. Digital peepholes have a camera outside and an LCD screen inside, without any information going from the inside to the outside. Another technique to prevent someone on the outside from seeing inside that is used by manufacturers of peepholes is to design them so that the outside-facing lens actually projects an image onto a semi- opaque (frosted or ground-glass finish) piece of glass on the inside-facing side that acts as a screen so that the person inside can see, at arms length, who is on the other side. The frosted glass finish makes it impossible for someone to look through from the outside. There are possible drawbacks to the projection method. One drawback is that the area to be viewed must be well lit and yet another drawback might be that to install these types of viewers there needs to be a much larger hole made in the door than that which has to be made for the traditional style of peephole.

They are also known as the Radar Igloo and Radar Buildings. They now operate as the Estuarine Interpretive Centre. It was formed at Richmond, New South Wales on 19 June 1942. After initial training the radar group was sent to Beverley Park, Kogarah on 14 August 1942, then Kyeemagh on 27 August 1942 and to its final posting at Ash Island, Kooragang, Newcastle from 7 September 1942. The radar station on Ash Island was established to detect enemy airborne threats during World War II. It housed British mobile equipment and the most modern Canadian GCI set, which was well protected in two concrete reinforced igloo buildings. No. 131 Radar Station RAAF was disbanded on 18 January 1946. The remains of the Ash Island radar station, which the unit occupied from September 1942 until January 1946, were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 16 April 2010.  History  The earliest inhabitants of the lower Hunter River estuary were the Worimi and Awabakal Aboriginal groups. For thousands of years, these people hunted and gathered food around the many small islands within the estuary. In 1951 when five low- lying islands were reclaimed and joined to make the industrial Kooragang Island, the natural landscape underwent substantial change which has seen a significant loss in the physical remnants of Aboriginal occupation of the area.Kooragang Wetland Rehabilitation Project, 2005; AMBS, 2004; NPWS, 1998; Newcastle Port Corporation, 2007 Following European contact and Newcastle's settlement in 1804, the rich alluvial soil of the islands in the Hunter River estuary attracted the settlers who began farming and grazing the land. Ash Island was to become a significant site for dairy farming but with regular flooding with the estuary, these practices became increasingly difficult.Kooragang Wetland Rehabilitation Project, 2005; Dept Public Works, 1971 When Japan entered the World War II, there was widespread apprehension that Australia may be vulnerable to enemy attack and invasion. In early 1942, the armed services directed increased attention to radar for locating and intercepting enemy aircraft in an effort to protect Australia's coastline and its strategically important towns and cities. These efforts intensified again following the submarine attacks on Sydney Harbour and Newcastle on 8 June 1942.Dept Veterans' Affairs, 2002; Fenton, 1995; Newcastle Council, 2008 Although the shelling of Newcastle resulted in no physical injuries and very little material damage, the event caused panic and highlighted the vulnerability of Newcastle and its industries to enemy attack. During the Second World War, the industrial city of Newcastle was at the centre of Australia's total war effort. Bullet-proof steel and armoured vehicles, heavy guns, ammunition, explosive shells, shipping and aircraft sections and a host of other essential parts and products were manufactured in Newcastle and, being strategically important, the most advanced technology was required to protect the city from any further attacks.Dept Veterans' Affairs, 2002; Fenton, 1995 Only 12 days after Newcastle was shelled, 131 Radar Station was formed at RAAF Base Richmond. This mobile Ground Control Interception (GCI) unit was based on British radar practices that emerged in 1940 to detect and intercept enemy aircraft before they reached the intended target. This state- of-the-art British technology allowed the operators to obtain grid references without the need to calculate the coordinates manually thus saving critical time. 131 Radar Station also used uniquely advanced technology because the operators were able to estimate, in addition to direction and range, the size and height of the aircraft by assessing the strength of the signals received.Fenton, 1995 Originally this mobile GCI unit, made up of British Mark V equipment, was housed on the back of 4x4 Crossley trucks, camouflaged underneath netted canopies. In August 1942, 131 Radar Station was moved to Beverley Park at Kogarah and then on to Kyeemagh where a series of test flights were logged to assess the performance of the equipment and the skills of the operating staff. In September 1942, the mobile unit received instructions and were transferred to Ash Island to be responsible for the protection of Newcastle.Fenton, 1995; Newcastle Council, 2008 Upon arrival on Ash Island, the operating staff were met with swampland, mangroves and mosquitoes. Although facilities were limited, the Island was an ideal location for 131 Radar Station because the surrounding water was a good reflector, assisting the radar to detect any aircraft. By late 1942, Ash Island, although fairly typical of small RAAF stations on the coast, had become a permanent radar post and the operating staff was at full strength (two Commanding Officers, 25 RAAF and 22 Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF)). On 16 December 1942, 131 Radar Station commenced 24-hour watch and by the end of January 1943, the new Mark V transmitter and receiver, the latest equipment and technology from Canada, arrived at Ash Island in preparation for the construction of galvanized \\"Doover\\" huts (a half-mile north west of the camp) to house the station. By February 1943, the WAAAF complement at 131 Radar Station outnumbered the RAAF contingent for the first time and included many of the first group of WAAAF radar operators trained at Richmond. Also in February 1943, the Crossley trucks that had housed the mobile GCI units left Ash Island for Maroubra and the construction of the two concrete igloos, with walls one foot thick, was underway. The almost impenetrable igloos were British in design and were intended to be built as underground bunkers. However, in Australia, these buildings were constructed above ground but disguised with netting. By mid 1943, the igloos were complete and the receiver and transmitter equipment installed in one and an emergency power unit housed in the other. The new Canadian equipment delivered to 131 Radar Station was state-of-the-art technology that was operated by the experienced and competent teams at Ash Island. The unit was divided into teams of five operators and one mechanic to work in shifts of six hours over the 24-hour period. The functions of the operators rotated every 30 minutes and covered the antenna rotation, Plan Position Indicator (PPI) tube, range/height tube and plotting table as well as an officer to keep a running order of all plots and heights taken. Meanwhile, the mechanic focussed on the transmitter and, along with the Commanding Officer, was responsible for supervising the maintenance and operation of the equipment. Although the staff at 131 Radar Station were trained and prepared for conflict, as the war progressed and the threat of enemy invasion lessened, the station assumed a secondary role as a training and demonstration centre for radar officers, controllers, recorders, operators and mechanics. The day-to-day activities were maintained by the WAAAF officers, however, in January 1945, 131 Radar Station was put on \\"Care and Maintenance\\" service and the staff contingent was reduced severely. On 18 January 1946, 131 Radar Station was officially disbanded.Fenton, 1995; Wikipedia, 2009 Since completion of its active duty during World War II, 131 Radar Station has become the Estuarine Interpretive Centre (EIC) as part of the Kooragang Wetland Rehabilitation Project. The Centre is an educational centre that houses interpretive material illustrating the estuarine ecosystem as well as the history of the island. ;Comparisons with other RAAF Radar Stations in New South Wales During World War II, hundreds of radar stations were built along the Australian coastline to detect and intercept signals from any approaching enemies. Of the 100 or more built in Australia, there are very few remaining intact. With the stations and the associated camps being largely built of lightweight and portable structures, there is little built fabric remaining in situ other than concrete foundations on which the aerial structures were built. Other than 131 Radar Station (former) at Ash Island, the only other significantly-intact station remaining in NSW is the RAAF 208 Radar Station at Catherine Hill Bay. This site was listed on the State Heritage Register in July 2008. Located south of Newcastle, the 208 Radar Station was an Advanced Chain Overseas (ACO) unit that utilised a different form of radar technology than the Ground Control Interception unit (GCI) installed at Ash Island. However, the 208 Radar Station did use the aboveground concrete igloo structures to house the radar equipment as did the 131 Radar Station (former).  Description of the Ash Island remains The 131 Radar Station (former) is located on Ash Island, on the western end of Kooragang Island. Situated north of Newcastle, Kooragang Island is located at the mouth of the Hunter River Estuary between the north and south arms of the river. The land, on which 131 Radar Station (former) is located, is bounded by the following coordinates: :32 degrees 50'31.89\\"S, 151 degrees 42'55.57\\"E :32 degrees 50'31.13\\"S, 151 degrees 42'50.72\\"E :32 degrees 50'28.63\\"S, 151 degrees 42'51.48\\"E :32 degrees 50'29.29\\"S, 151 degrees 42'56.21\\"E The 131 Radar Station (former) includes two semi-cylindrical igloos, constructed of concrete approximately one foot thick and positioned approximately 50 metres apart. These igloos were British in design and were intended to be underground bunkers. However, the 131 Radar Station (former) (along with similar other stations in Australia) were constructed above ground and camouflaged while in use. The interior of the larger igloo was painted by Lyn Skillings with a mural depicting the natural environment. Some external plaster restoration was carried out in 1994 but this is deteriorating. There is a commemorative plaque mounted on the larger igloo that was unveiled during the National \\"BLIPS\\" Radar Reunion of 1995. The plaque states: :\\"Ash Island Radar Site :This plaque commemorates the operations conducted by No.131 Radar Station from 16th December 1942 until 18th January 1946. :No.131 Radar Station was located here and controlled the fighter aircraft based at RAAF Base Williamtown. :No.131 Radar Station employed British MkV and Canadian RWG/GCI radars. :This plaque is presented by the personnel of No.3 Control and Reporting Unit and the Radar Air Defence Branch of the RAAF Association in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of victory in the Pacific. :15th August 1995\\" The site also contains remnant concrete footings and a base for an antenna stand. The camp site that provided accommodation and living facilities for the on-site officers was located south east of the Radar Station but there are no visible remnants remaining in situ. A modern toilet facility was installed on the site in the late 1990s. Designed by Chris Tucker, the contemporary addition is sympathetic to the military heritage of the 131 Radar Station.Dept of Environment & Planning, 1983; SHI form, 2008; Fenton; 1995 The two concrete igloos are in good condition but the associated structures and features of the Radar Station are no longer remaining in situ. The two concrete igloo buildings are in good condition but there is some deterioration of the external concrete plaster. The associated structures and features of the Radar Station, situated southeast of the igloo buildings, are no longer remaining in situ.  Heritage listing  The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance as one of the few remaining radar igloos surviving in NSW from World War II. Originally formed as a mobile unit, the station was moved to its permanent base at Ash Island in September 1942. The almost-impenetrable concrete igloo buildings, based on a British underground bunker design, were constructed aboveground by mid-1943 and were used to house the advanced technology needed to detect approaching enemy aircraft. The 131 Radar Station (former) is also significant for its association with the RAAF and WAAAF officers who served at the station during its active service. 131 Radar Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 16 April 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance as one of the few remaining radar igloos surviving in NSW from World War II. Following the shelling of Newcastle in June 1942, the Australian armed services directed its attentions to a new type of radar which enabled Ground Controlled Interception (GCI), in an effort to protect Australia's coastline from attacks by enemy aircraft. Originally formed at the Richmond Air Base, 131 Radar Station was a mobile unit that was moved to its permanent base at Ash Island in September 1942. The almost-impenetrable concrete igloos were constructed by mid-1943 and were used to house the advanced technology needed to detect and intercept signals from approaching enemy aircraft. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance for its association with the officers of the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) and WAAAF (Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force) who served at the station during its active service in World War II. When the station was at full strength, the small but highly trained contingent was made up of 25 RAAF and 22 WAAAF officers. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The 131 Radar Station (former) has local significance for its aesthetic values. The two semi- cylindrical concrete igloos are distinctive in design and have a unique presence in the natural landscape of Ash Island. Originally designed by the British as underground bunkers, the Australian igloos were constructed aboveground but camouflaged with netting to disguise the buildings during active service. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance for its social value to the NSW community and for the former RAAF and WAAAF officers who served at the site. In June 1942, the shelling of Newcastle by the Japanese caused panic in NSW and action was quickly taken by the Australian armed services to establish the 131 Radar Station which was to serve and protect Newcastle from aircraft attack for several years. In 1995, there was a reunion for the officers that served at the station during World War II and a plaque to commemorate these efforts was unveiled for the event. The igloos are now used as a display centre for the history of the island and an educational centre and for the Kooragang Wetland Rehabilitation Project that is working towards restoring the environment of the surrounding Hunter River estuary. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance as a unique example of the advanced technology used to detect and intercept enemy aircraft during World War II. Being one of the earliest Ground Control Interception (GCI) units in NSW, the 131 Radar Station used an improved radar technology which could detect and gauge the direction, range and height of enemy aircraft more rapidly thus proving to be valuable in the protection of the NSW coastline during World War II. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance as a rare example of a surviving radar station built during World War II. Over 100 radar stations were built during the war but the survival of the 131 Radar Station (former) is rare in NSW and it is a unique site that employed Ground Control Interception (GCI) technology to protect NSW from enemy aircraft attack during World War II. (see History - Comparisons with other RAAF radar stations in NSW). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The 131 Radar Station (former) has State significance as a representative example of a RAAF station built along the NSW coast during World War II. After Newcastle was shelled by the Japanese in June 1942, the Australian armed services quickly took action and set up the 131 Radar Station to serve and protect Newcastle from aircraft attack. Attention was directed towards radio direction and location and, by the end of 1942, an extensive network of radar units had been developed. Each of these stations could plot direction and range but 131 Radar Station, being a Ground Control Interception (GCI) unit, also had the advanced technology to gauge height from the signals received.

It acts as a potent, selective, centrally-penetrant Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist, and is the first and currently the only selective KOR agonist to have been approved for clinical use. It has also been dubiously referred to as the \\"first non-narcotic opioid drug\\" in history. History Nalfurafine was derived from structural modification of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. It was first synthesized and characterized in 1998, and was approved for clinical use in Japan as an intravenous drug under the brand name Remitch in 2009. The developer of nalfurafine also sought approval in Europe under the brand name Winfuran, but the Marketing Authorization Application was declined by the European Medicines Agency. The drug was originally developed as an analgesic in surgery, but while effective in animal models of nociception, it was repurposed as an antipruritic at lower treatment doses due to an apparently unacceptable incidence of sedative effects in humans. As of 2015, nalfurafine is also in clinical trials for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in Japan for patients with chronic liver disease, and for the treatment of uremic pruritus in the United States. Effects Unlike other KOR agonists, nalfurafine does not produce hallucinogenic effects in humans. Single intramuscular injections of up to 30 ¬µg are well tolerated by humans, whereas a dose of 40 ¬µg produced \\"moderate behavioral/psychological side effects\\" (possibly referring to sedation), though apparently did not produce any psychotomimetic or dysphoric effects. In rodents, a low dose of nalfurafine (10‚Äì40 ¬µg/kg) was found not to produce conditioned place preference or aversion, though a high dose (80 ¬µg/kg) did induce significant place aversion. The most common side effect of low-dose nalfurafine seen in clinical trials was insomnia (observed in 10‚Äì15% of patients), with few other adverse effects observed. In addition, tolerance to the antipruritic effects of nalfurafine was not found after treatment of patients with the drug for one year, and nalfurafine has shown no evidence of either physical nor psychological dependence in humans. The drug also shows lower evidence of tolerance for effects such as analgesia and sedation in animals relative to other KOR agonists. In animals, nalfurafine produces anti-scratch, antinociceptive, sedative, and diuretic effects. Mechanism of action Nalfurafine is an orally active, centrally acting, highly potent, selective full agonist of the Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 75 pM; EC50 = 25 pM). As touched on above, nalfurafine shows atypical properties as a KOR agonist relative to other drugs. Notably, it does not completely substitute for the prototypical KOR agonist U-50488 in rodents, indicating qualitative differences in the discriminative effects of the two compounds. Moreover, unlike U-50488, it produces neither conditioned place aversion or preference in rodents. The drug is a 4,5-epoxymorphinan derivative, and is structurally unique relative to other KOR agonists. Nalfurafine may be a biased agonist of the KOR or a KOR subtype-selective agonist. Indeed, it has been found to act as a biased agonist of the KOR, preferring activation of Œ≤-arrestin signaling in vitro, but paradoxically, Œ≤-arrestin appears to be responsible for KOR agonist-induced aversion, and nalfurafine furthermore shows paradoxical effects in vivo that are not consistent with its in vitro profile. As such, more research is needed to clarify the distinct mechanisms and effects of this drug. Nalfurafine has been found in vitro to bind to the Œº-opioid receptor and to possess weak partial agonist activity at this site, albeit with much lower affinity relative to the KOR. However, in vivo, nalfurafine has shown no indications of MOR agonism or antagonism in animals or humans, including no evidence of rewarding or reinforcing effects or physical dependence. Research Nalfurafine has been found to be effective in a variety of animal models relevant to drug abuse, addiction, and dependence, and may represent a novel potential treatment for these maladies. In rodents, the drug attenuates the discriminative and rewarding effects of cocaine and the rewarding and locomotor effects of morphine, and diminishes the mecamylamine-precipitated aversive effect of nicotine withdrawal.

He was best known as National President of Veterans For Peace (VFP) from 2000 to 2006, Chapter Vice President of Alan Reilly - Gene Glazer VFP Chapter 21, and co- founder of the Vietnam Agent Orange Relief and Responsibility Campaign. Cline was featured in the 2006 film Sir! No Sir!, which documented the GI antiwar movement during the Vietnam war as well as in the book \\"Winter Soldiers: An Oral History of Vietnam Veterans Against the War\\" by Richard Stacewicz. Cline was known not only for his anti-war stance upon returning from service in Vietnam, but also for being a leader in the anti-Iraq War movement. As President of VFP, Cline built a relationship between VFP and the fledgling organization of military families opposed to the war in Iraq, Military Families Speak Out! (MFSO) in 2002 and provided guidance to returning Iraq vets who founded Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) in 2004. He is credited with helping to establish the Bring Them Home Now Campaign and served on the organization's coordinating committee until his death. In 2002, he led a group of activists to Puerto Rico to protest the U.S. Navy's use of depleted uranium and Vieques as a bombing range. Following VFPs arrival in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina behind the leadership of Desert Storm Veteran Dennis Kyne, Dave was instrumental in planning the Walkin' To New Orleans march from Mobile, Alabama to New Orleans, Louisiana to draw attention to the work Kyne and many others had done. Personal information and Army Tour Cline was born on January 8, 1947 in Buffalo, New York and died on September 14, 2007 at his home in Jersey City, New Jersey at the age of 60. He was drafted into the U.S. Army when he was 20 years old, arriving in Vietnam in August 1967 and serving in the 25th Infantry Division as a rifleman and machine gunner. During his tour, he was wounded three times, the third time seriously enough to be sent back to the army hospital at Fort Dix, New Jersey in 1968. He received three Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star during his time in the Army. He later recalled being told he was going to Vietnam \\"to help the people of South Vietnam\\", but quickly realized it wasn't true because the Army hated the Vietnamese \\"As soon as you get there they first thing they tell you is you can't trust any of them, they're gooks, they're not human beings.\\" While recuperating from his injuries in a hospital he found a book \\"called The New Legions by Donald Duncan\\", an ex-Green Beret who after his tour in Vietnam wrote about why he quit the Army. Cline felt that Duncan was saying \\"basically...we're fighting on the wrong side.\\" Cline said, \\"When I read that book it made a lot of sense to me because that's what I saw. So I made a decision I was going to come back to the United States and start working against the war.\\" Antiwar and Union Activity Returning to Fort Hood, Texas, Cline became an anti-war activist, serving as a civilian organizer of active duty servicemen at one of the first GI Coffeehouses, the Oleo Strut, in Killeen, Texas and producing a one-sheet underground newspaper on politics and veterans issues called Fatigue Press, which was distributed clandestinely on the military base. He explained, \\"I was sent down to Fort Hood and that's when I really got hooked up with the GI movement.\\" He soon realized the base was training soldiers just back from Vietnam in riot control to go to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. There were a lot of soldiers not happy about this, \\"we fought the Vietnamese, now they want you to fight Americans. A lot of people identified with the demonstrators on different levels.\\" \\"We decided to organize a movement against it because there was a lot of opposition to the ideal of going to Chicago.\\" He joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War in 1970, where he served as a coordinator and national director, and remained a member until his death. While working for the U.S. Postal Service in Jersey City, Cline was a post office union representative and served as vice president of Transportation Workers Union Local 600.

Osio married Dolores Arg√ºello, sister of Luis Antonio Arg√ºello, the first governor of California. In 1838, Osio settled in Monterey. In 1839, Governor Alvarado granted Osio, Angel Island, on the condition that Osio would set aside part of the island for a fort. However, Osio never took up residence there. In 1839, Osio bought Rancho Punta de los Reyes from Joseph Snook (1798‚Äì1848), and sought about acquiring the adjacent eleven square league Rancho Punta de los Reyes Sobrante, which Governor Micheltorena granted him in 1843. Osio was also the grantee of the six square league Rancho Aguas Frias given by Governor Micheltorena in 1844. After Osio was granted Rancho Punta de los Reyes Sobrante, he built a few structures, but didn‚Äôt spend much time there. He moved his family to San Rafael. In 1843, when Rafael Garcia moved onto part of the neighboring Rancho Punta de los Reyes of James Richard Berry; Berry, in turn, moved west onto a portion of Osio‚Äôs Rancho Punta de los Reyes Sobrante.

The Division fought at Kursk, Kharkiv, Budapest, and Prague, and was serving with the 53rd Army of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in May 1945.Poirer and Connor, Red Army Order of Battle After a period as a 35th Guards Mechanized Division, and then 35th Guards Motor Rifle Division 1957-65, the Division was redesignated as the 93rd Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1965. It served with the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary during the last years of the Cold War,Michael Holm/V.I.Feskov et al., 93rd Guards Motorised Rifle Division, 2015. and after the fall of the Berlin Wall was withdrawn to Ukraine from October 1990 to January 1991.

In Decree 925/96(?), Colonel Anatoly Savatiovich Pushnyakov, Commander of the 93rd Mechanised Division of the 6th Army Corps, Southern Operational Command, Ukrainian Ground Forces, was promoted to General-Major. The division appears to have been redesignated a brigade after 1996 and after 1999. Throughout 1999, the '93rd Motor Rifle Division' conducted a series of small unit and staff officer exchanges with the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard.Globalsecurity.org, Ukrainian National Guard On December 10, 2007 the Brigade received its Colour by the order of the President of Ukraine. The brigade fought in the War in Donbass, defending Donetsk International Airport during the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport alongside the 95th Airmobile Brigade. The brigade is currently based in Krasnoarmiisk. On 18 November 2015 its honorifics \\"Twice Red Banner Orders of Suvorov and Kutuzov\\" were removed as part of an Armed Forces-wide removal of Soviet awards and honorifics, but not its Kharkiv battle honor, given as a result of its participation in the 1943 Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation. On 22 August 2016, its Guards title was also removed. In honor of the centennial year of the Ukrainian War of Independence the brigade received its second honorific title, Kholodnyi Yar (Kholodnyi Yar was a pro-Ukrainian partisan self-proclaimed state that existed from 1919 to 1922), in 2018, and thus its Kharkiv battle honour was officially removed from the full title of the unit.93 –û–ú–ë—Ä –ó–°–£ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ –•–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ—è—Ä—Å—å–∫–æ—é. –§–û–¢–û // –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∏–π –Ω–∞–≤—ñ–≥–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ A new colour was also received by the brigade command which differs from the maroon colour it received in 2007.

The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be \\"always already\\" present. Development \\"Always already\\" literally translates the German phrase immer schon that appears prominently in several 20th century philosophical works, notably Martin Heidegger's Being and Time. The phrase is not specific to philosophy in German, but refers to an action or condition that has continued without any identifiable beginning. Heidegger used the phrase routinely to indicate that Dasein, the human experience of existence, has no beginning apart from the world in which one exists, but is produced in it and by it.Dreyfus, Hubert L. and Mark A. Wrathal (2008) A Companion to Heidegger, p. 389 On the strength of Heidegger's influence, French and later English philosophers adopted the literal translation of the phrase. In the Marxist tradition, Louis Althusser observed that \\"individuals are always-already subjects\\" within an ideological structure before they perceive themselves as such‚Äîindeed, even before birth.Althusser, Louis (1970) \\"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\\" During the late 20th century the term spread into various areas of philosophical discourse that include literary theory, hermeneutics and deconstruction.

It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem over a period of several minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.  Taxonomy and naming  Baorangia bicolor was originally named in 1807 by the Italian botanist Giuseppe Raddi. American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named a species collected in Sandlake, New York, in 1870, Boletus bicolor. Although this naming is considered illegitimate due to article 53.1 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Peck is still given as the authority in the Bessette et al. (2000) monograph of North American boletes. Boletus bicolor (Raddi) is not a synonym of \\"Boletus bicolor\\" Peck. Peck's Boletus bicolor describes the Eastern North American species that is the familiar \\"two-colored bolete\\", while Raddi's Boletus bicolor describes a separate European species that is lost to science. This taxonomic conflict has yet to be resolved. In 1909 a species found in Singapore was named Boletus bicolor by George Edward Massee; this naming is illegitimate and is synonymous with Boletochaete bicolor according to Singer. Molecular studies found that Boletus bicolor was not closely related to the type species of Boletus, Boletus edulis, and in 2015 Alfredo Vizzini transferred Boletus bicolor to the genus Baorangia. The original botanical name for this two-colored bolete was derived from the Latin words b≈çlƒìtus, meaning \\"mushroom\\", and bicolor, meaning \\"having two colors.\\"  Description  The pore surface of B. bicolor is bright yellow. The color of the cap of the two-colored bolete varies from light red and almost pink to brick red. The most common coloration is brick red when mature. The cap usually ranges from to in width, with bright yellow pores underneath. The two-colored bolete is one of several types of boletes that have the unusual reaction of the pore surface producing a dark blue/indigo when it is injured, although the reaction is slower than with other bluing boletes. When the flesh is exposed it also turns a dark blue, but less dramatically than the pore surface. Young fruit bodies have bright yellow pore surfacesthat slowly turn a dingy yellow in maturity. The stem of the two- colored bolete ranges from to in length and ranges from to in width. The stem coloration is yellow at the apex and a red or rosy red for the lower two thirds. When injured it bruises blue very slowly and may hardly change color at all in some cases. The stem lacks a ring and lacks a partial veil.  Microscopic characteristics  The spore deposit of the two-colored bolete is olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are slightly oblong to ventricose in face view; in profile view, the spores are roughly inequilateral to oblong, and have a shallow suprahilar depression. The spores appear nearly hyaline (translucent) to pale dingy ochraceous when mounted in potassium hydroxide solution (KOH), have a smooth surface, and measure 8‚Äì12 by 3.5‚Äì5 Œºm. The tube trama is divergent and gelatinous, originates from a single central strand, not amyloid, and will often stain yellow-brown when placed in dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH).  Chemical tests  Further methods of identification are chemical tests. With the application of FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it will turn a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO4 is applied to it, a pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH4OH.  Edibility  The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, although some may have an allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although it is said to have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two- colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.  Distribution and habitat  The two-colored bolete is distributed from southeastern Canada and the Great Lakes Region, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains, as far south as the Florida peninsula, and out to the Midwest as far as Wisconsin. It is commonly found in deciduous woodland and usually grows under or close to broad-leaved trees, especially oak. It can be found in isolation and in groups or clusters, primarily during June through October. The two-colored bolete is also found in China and Nepal, where it is one of the most used mushrooms of over 200 species of edible mushrooms used in Nepal. This unusual distribution of the two-colored bolete and other mushrooms is known as the Grayan disjunction; the phenomenon is characterized by a species living in one continent or island and then also on the other side of the world with no specimens of the species living in between the specific habitats. The Grayan disjunction is not uncommon among fungi.  Similar species  Hortiboletus rubellus The two- colored bolete has several species that are similar to it and the differences are minute in most cases. Boletus sensibilis differs from the two-colored bolete in that it has an immediate bruising reaction and is poisonous, causing stomach upset if ingested, and in some cases a severe allergic reaction. B. miniato-olivaceus has a full yellow stem and slightly lighter cap coloration. It also has a more immediate bruising reaction than the two-colored bolete and the stem is slightly longer in proportion to the cap. B. peckii differs from the two-colored bolete by having a smaller average size, a rose red cap that turns almost brown with age, flesh that is paler in color, and a bitter taste. B. speciosus differs from the two-colored bolete by having a fully reticulated stem, more brilliant colors, and very narrow cylindrical spores. Hortiboletus rubellus subsp. rubens and the two-colored bolete have been found to have almost no difference between them, and they cannot be distinguished by appearance alone. Boletus bicoloroide is very similar to the two-colored bolete, the major differences between them being B. bicoloroide has only been found in Michigan and has larger spores. B. bicoloroide is also slightly larger than the two-colored bolete, around longer in the stem and in the cap. This species has not been as thoroughly researched as the two-colored bolete, thus macrochemical tests, edibility, distribution range, and the spore print color are all unknown.  Varieties  There are two varieties of the two- colored bolete: borealis and subreticulatus. Both varieties have a very similar habitat to that of the main species, except they appear to be limited to just the North American continent. Both varieties also have a slightly different coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.  Variety borealis  Variety borealis has a slightly darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia bicolor var. bicolor.  Variety subreticulatus  Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a generally darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies much more than either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface is similar to that of the main species-yellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.

Indigenous peoples of the Americas have traditionally used tobacco for religious purposes, while Abrahamic and other religions have only been introduced to the practice in recent times due to the European colonization of the Americas in the 16th century. Abrahamic religions With the exception of a few Christian denominations, the Abrahamic religions originated before tobacco smoking was introduced to Europe from the New World. Therefore, these religions do not address it in their foundational teachings; however, modern practitioners have offered interpretations of their faith with regard to smoking. Christianity Johann Sebastian Bach was known to enjoy smoking a pipe, and wrote poetry on how doing so enhanced his relationship with God.Johann Sebastian Bach (1725). Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker. In the 19th century, smoking was considered as inappropriate by certain Christians. In the autumn of 1874 George Frederick Pentecost got into the so-called Daily Telegraph scandal: a smoking controversy, over which his counterpart Charles Spurgeon, known as the 'prince of preachers', was exploited by the tobacco industry. Tobacco was listed, along with drunkenness, gambling, cards, dancing and theatre-going, in J.M. Judy's Questionable Amusements and Worthy Substitutes, a book featuring anti-smoking dialogue which was published in 1904 by the Western Methodist Book of Concern. Though there is no official canonical prohibition regarding the use of tobacco, the more traditional among the Eastern Orthodox Churches forbid their clergy or monastics to smoke, and the laity are strongly encouraged to give up this habit, if they are subject to it. One who smokes is considered to be polluting the \\"Temple of the Holy Spirit\\" (i.e., the body), which has been sanctified by the reception of the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments). (The view of the body being the \\"temple of the Holy Spirit\\" is also common in Protestant circles, and is quoted as a basis against not only tobacco use, but recreational drugs, eating disorders, sexual immorality, and other vices which can be harmful to the body. The Bible reference is I Corinthians 6:7-20.) In Orthodox cultures, various derogatory terms have developed to describe smoking, such as \\"incense of Satan\\". Father Alexander Lebedeff described the Orthodox approach as follows: The Roman Catholic Church does not condemn smoking per se, but considers excessive smoking to be sinful, as described in the Catechism (CCC 2290): Jehovah's Witnesses have not permitted any active members to smoke since 1973,\\"Life Story: Jehovah Always Rewards His Loyal Ones\\", The Watchtower, September 1, 2000, page 26. The footnote reads: \\"The Watchtower of June 1, 1973, explained why from that time forward, an individual would need to quit smoking before he could be baptized and become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.\\" and their literature has warned about physical and spiritual dangers of smoking. The Seventh-day Adventist Church also requires its members to abstain from tobacco use. It has called for governments to enact policies that include \\"a uniform ban on all tobacco advertising, stricter laws prohibiting smoking in non-residential public places, more aggressive and systematic public education, and substantially higher taxes on cigarettes.\\" The founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Joseph Smith, recorded that on February 27, 1833 he received a revelation which addressed tobacco use. It is commonly known as the Word of Wisdom, found in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and prohibits the smoking or chewing of tobacco. () While initially viewed as a guideline, this was eventually accepted as a commandment by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Word of Wisdom is also practiced to various degrees by other Latter Day Saint denominations. Smoking is discouraged and prevents baptism or temple attendance. Islam Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was one of the first authorities to take action on smoking in 1602, towards the end of his reign. The ruler of the Saadi dynasty used the religious tool of fatwas (Islamic legal pronouncements) to discourage the use of tobacco. A couple of years later, his ally, the Christian ruler James I would publish his treatise, Counterblaste to Tobacco. The holy book of Islam, the Qur'ƒÅn, does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance: * \\"Don't throw yourself into danger by your own hands ...\\" (el-Bakara: Quran 2:195) and, in recent years, tobacco fatwas have been issued due to health concerns. The prominent scholar Yusuf al Qaradawi argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks. > The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling > concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on > differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification > of the cause on which the ruling is based.

They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins. All contemporary rulings tend to condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit (haram) smoking outright as a cause of severe health damage. Arab Muslims tend to prohibit smoking (despite Saudi Arabia ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes) and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged: > In many parts of the Arabic speaking world, the legal status of smoking has > further changed during recent years, and numerous religious edicts or > fatawa, including from notable authorities such as Al-Azhar University in > Egypt, now declare smoking to be prohibited. The reasons cited in support of > the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include Islamic law's general > prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Qur'an > says, \\"And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your > own hands contribute to your own destruction (Q2:195).\\" Additionally, > jurists rely on the exhortations in the Qur'an not to waste money. Greater > appreciation of the risks associated with passive smoking, has also led > recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, > distress, or harm to other people. In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, Pakistan) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking. A study of young Muslim Arab- Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking. Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking fatwa did not reduce smoking. Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries. =Backlash= From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to sharia law\\", and be \\"a threat to existing government\\". The tobacco industry was also concerned that the World Health Organization's encouraging of anti-smoking stance of Muslim scholars. A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: \\"This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause.\\" Judaism Early on in the Hasidic movement, the Baal Shem Tov taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era. Rabbi Levi Yitchak of Berditchev is quoted as saying that \\"a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath\\". Rabbi Dovid of Lelov taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of Lelov and Skulen, however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after Havdalah. Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of Purim, even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple. However, in recent years, many Hasidic Rabbis have come out against smoking, as have rabbis of other movements. Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (1838‚Äì1933) was one of the first Jewish authorities to speak out on smoking. He considered it a health risk and a waste of time, and had little patience for those who claimed addiction, stating that they never should have started smoking in the first place (Likutei Amarim 13, Zechor le-Miriam 23). A shift toward health-oriented concerns may be observed in different rabbinic interpretations of Jewish law (halakha). For instance, at a time when the link between smoking and health was still in doubt, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein issued an influential opinion in 1963 stating that smoking was permitted, although still inadvisable. (Igrot Moshe Y.D. II:49) More recently, rabbinic responsa tend to argue that smoking is prohibited as self-endangerment under Jewish law and that smoking in indoor spaces should be restricted as a type of damage to others. The self-endangerment rule is grounded partly on a Biblical verse that is read as an injunction to watch one's health - \\"◊ï◊†◊©◊û◊®◊™◊ù ◊û◊ê◊ì, ◊ú◊†◊§◊©◊™◊ô◊õ◊ù\\" [Vi'nish'martem Me'od Li'naf'sho'tey'chem] \\"And you shall watch yourselves very well ...\\" Similarly, rabbinic rules against damaging others are traced back to Biblical and Talmudic laws. Famous Ashkenazi Haredi rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit.' These rabbis include Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman, Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Shapiro, Rabbi Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, and Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach. Rabbi Shmuel HaLevi Wosner forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke should stop doing so. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.; ; Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Ben Tzion Abba Shaul and Rabbi Moshe Tzedaka called on youth not to start smoking. Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, Rabbi Moshe Stern, and Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg. Hinduism While not explicitly prohibited in Hinduism, tobacco use is seen as a kind of intoxication, and as such should not be done in public. Vaishnavas of ISKCON, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, are prohibited from using tobacco. Native American religions Sisseton Sioux. Ceremonial pipe bowl of catlinite used by Black Hawk, of the Sauk people. Communal smoking of a sacred pipe is a religious ceremony in a number of Native American cultures, while other tribes are social smokers only, if they smoke at all. In some cases tobacco is smoked, in other cases, kinnikinnick, or a combination of the two. Naturally grown and harvested tobacco, prepared in the ways traditional to intact Native American and First Nations ceremonial communities, is very different from commercially-marketed tobacco. Commercial tobacco usually contains chemical additives and much higher levels of nicotine. In ceremonial usage, much smaller amounts of natural tobacco are burned than in secular, recreational tobacco smoking. There is a movement among Native peoples, including a resolution by The National Congress of American Indians, to make sure that only naturally-grown tobacco is used in ceremonies, and that social smoking and use of commercial tobacco be avoided or ended altogether. > WHEREAS, the quality of commercial tobacco products has been compromised due > to the chemical engineering by the tobacco industry and commercial tobacco > contains 7,000 chemical additives (such as rat poison, formaldehyde, > ammonia, acetone, arsenic and many more) that are harmful to health; and > commercial tobacco disrespects the fundamental cultural traditions of > American Indians and Alaska Natives; ... > ... > NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the National Congress of American > Indians does hereby endorse policies for the protection of tribal community > members from tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure through comprehensive > tribal commercial tobacco-free air policies (including all forms of > commercial tobacco products) in indoor workplaces and public places > (including tribal casinos), providing access to high quality tobacco > cessation services, and promotes the creation of policy to dis-incentivize > individuals from purchasing and using commercial tobacco products; \\\\- > National Congress of American Indians Resolution #SPO-16-046 Pagan faiths Tobacco use holds a sacred and/or neutral view in numerous if not all pagan religions and seen in some as liberty and intoxication with the divine. Sikhism Guru Gobind Singh prohibited his Sikhs from smoking tobacco. He called tobacco \\"jagat jhoot\\" (Punjabi: \\"the world's lie\\"). A legend states that when Guru Gobind Singh Ji was riding his blue horse, Neela, it would not enter a tobacco field and reared up in front of it. Zoroastrianism The idea of smoking tobacco has been looked down upon in modern Zoroastrian communities due to the scientific knowledge of it causing harm to the body. This stance on smoking does not have a direct relation to the texts of the Avestas and is not stated in the religion, rather the religion teaches to not misuse fire as it is holy. Zoroastrianism teaches to do what is best for the world based on the knowledge a person has on the topic, and indirectly the knowledge of smoking being harmful to the body causes people to condemn the act.

History A postcard depicting South Side, circa 1930‚Äì1945. On September 11, 1922, South Side High School opened its doors to students for the first time. The idea of a second high school in the city of Fort Wayne became a reality in 1920 when Fort Wayne High School, later known as Central High School, became overcrowded. As a site for the new high school, the school board chose a tract of land on South Calhoun Street close to the city limits. The land on which the school was constructed had been used for gardens by residents. The land that the football field was constructed was rather flat. This site had previously been occupied by the Kaylor Brickyard. When South Side High School opened its doors, classes were primarily held in the south part of the building because the north section, particularly in the area of the Gymnasium, had not yet been completed. To further complications, the approximate 800 high school students shared the building with 510 grade school students. The South Side Grade School continued to be part of the facility until the fall of 1925 when Harrison Hill Elementary School opened. When South Side High School first opened, desks and other furnishings had not been delivered to classrooms. As a result, students frequently had to sit on nail kegs. Because construction was not completed, half-day sessions were held for several weeks until October 30, 1922 when the first full-day session took place. At the time South Side opened, it was the largest one-story school building in the United States. The building itself covered and the normal capacity was 1,500 students. It was also one of the first school building in the nation to use a series of ramps instead of stairs. As the school population increased, additions to the original structure were made in the late 1930s, the late 1950s and in 1970-1973. The 1970-73 addition included several classrooms, a new media center and a new auditorium. A new physical education facility was completed in January, 1981, and recently South Side has completed a 39.5 million dollar renovation which includes Fort Wayne's only olympic-sized swimming pool. South Side is now an academic gem in the FWCS crown. South Side High School has been for over 60 years a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and is a Special First-Class Commissioned High School by order of the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction. In the spring of 2000, South Side received full accreditation in the Performance Based Accreditation system of the Department of Education. From 1963 to 1966, from 1968 to 1974 and again from 1976 to the present, South Side has been privileged to be a member of the prestigious College Entrance Examination Board of New York City which serves the colleges and secondary schools of the nation. In 1982, South Side was elected to permanent membership in the College Board - one of only thirteen Indiana high schools at that time to be so honored. Six principals have served the school in the past: Robert Harris, 1922-1926; R. Nelson Snider, 1926-1963; Jack E. Weicker, 1963-1990; and Jennifer Manth, 1990-2001. Thomas Smith was the most recent principal to leave South Side. Carlton Mable currently serves as the principal of South Side. Ninety-five individual staff members have served the school for twenty-five years or longer.\\"About South Side High School\\" (accessed 2016-05-09). South Side's athletic teams are the Archers.

They were variously called the Milan Team or the Milan Associates. Mara Selvini Palazzoli and the Milan Team worked with serious psychiatric disorders in families with anorexic (see her book on Self- Starvation: From Individual to Family Therapy in the Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa, 1978) and schizophrenic members (see the original Milan Team's volume, Paradox and Counterparadox: A New Model in the Therapy of the Family in Schizophrenic Transaction, 1978; and a later team's work called, Family Games: General Models of Psychotic Processes in the Family, 1989). Her work on anorexia nervosa attracted much attention beyond family therapy and she wrote on the historical, social, and cultural aspects of anorexia in her book, Self- Starvation and in Transcultural Psychiatry. The Milan approach involved careful attention to everything, starting with language; for example, they did not refer to schizophrenia as a diagnosis but to \\"families in schizophrenic transaction,\\" which created a powerful coherence between how family problems are imagined, the theory of their origins, and how to effect change. This systemic approach in which the disturbed person and the family form a system and the therapeutic team is imagined as a system was based on American anthropologist Gregory Bateson's cybernetics theory, the work of the Mental Research Institute (MRI) in Palo Alto, California, and Paul Watzlawick's Pragmatics of Human Communication. Selvini Palazzoli extended her systemic model through consultations with larger systems such as a large school system, a hospital pediatrics ward, a teacher training institute and a large corporation which was reported with a new team of psychologists in The Hidden Games of Organizations (1986). From her early pioneering work on self- starvation to the creation of the Milan model of systemic family therapy and finally with her consultations on larger systems, Selvini Palazzoli's work is considered theoretically groundbreaking, dramatic in style, and powerful in its impact clinically and institutionally. Her son, psychologist Matteo Selvini, collected her papers and selections from her books in The Work of Mara Selvini Palazzoli (1988).DiNicola, Vincenzo F.

Peabody of Peabody Coal from 1911 to 1921. History The home was built in 1889 and was purchased by Francis Stuyvesant Peabody in 1911. Peabody was the founder of Peabody, Daniels & Company, which bought coal from mines and sold it to Chicago area homes and businesses. In 1903, his company forged a deal with the Chicago Edison Company to be the main supplier of coal for local power plants. Coal demand for these plants skyrocketed, and by 1920, Peabody's company supplied over 2.3 million tons of coal per year. Peabody was also associated with the Democratic Party and was considered for the Vice President of the United States in 1912. He stepped down as company president in favor of his son Stuyvesant in 1919 and served as chairman of the board until his death in 1922.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/205569.pdf Peabody's second wife, Mary Gertrude Sullivan, was originally a resident of Hinsdale and was a possible influence on Peabody's decision to reside there. Peabody lived in 15 different houses during his career, but was most associated with his Hinsdale residence. The south side of the home was probably extended while the Peabodys lived there. The Peabodys moved into the Mayslake Peabody Estate in 1921. Architecture The house is on the southwest corner of Third and Washington Streets in a residential district. The house immediately to the east is thought to be formerly associated with the Peabody property, perhaps a barn or garage. The main facade faces north toward Third Street. The exterior is largely covered in narrow clapboards painted light tan. The two stories of the house are divided on the exterior with a thin line of dark tan molding. It is built on an ashlar limestone foundation, painted off-white. The original house was built in 1889 and consisted of what is now the parlor, tower, front hall, and part of the kitchen, library, and dining room. There were significant additions around 1897, where the southern and western ends of the house were extended. Furthermore, the wood deck was replaced with limestone, a third floor dormer window was added to the tower, a room was added on the second and this floors above the main porch, a porte-cochere was added to the east of the porch, and a new hexagonal porch was added to the northwest corner. A second wave of additions occurred some time between 1909 and 1919 and probably occurred shortly after it was purchased by Peabody. The south side was again extended. Modern additions occurred in 1940 and c. 1980.

The Boston Computer Exchange, also called the BCE and BoCoEx, were in operation before the Internet became widely available to the general public. Their Bulletin Board System-based marketplace utilized Delphi online service as a platform for an on-line database of products where buyers and sellers bought, sold and traded computers. The company pioneered efforts to create a fully automated, on-line auction and trade systems for general commerce and eventually turned into an Internet-based business.  Origins  Boston Computer Exchange was founded in 1982 as a marketplace for people who wanted to sell their used computers. Initially it was a paper database but quickly moved into a computerized database using Alpha 2 database manager on a dual floppy IBM PC. Nascent bulletin board systems were just being developed and the founders struck a mutual agreement with the owners of the Delphi online service bulletin board system to post the database on their public access system. The first database upload was on March 4, 1983. Fresh data was posted every day from that day until the business closed in the 1990s. The database was also posted as a searchable database on YellowData, and then Boston CitiNet. Later, when CompuServe opened their Electronic Mall in 1989, Boston Computer Exchange had the first store on that Mall, too.  Founders  The founders of the Boston Computer Exchange were Alexander Randall 5th and Cameron Hall. Randall held a PhD in General Systems research or Systems Theory and Hall had degrees in Economics. They fused their interest in creating a computerized marketplace for trade. The husband and wife started the business on the dining room table and worked together on it steadily for the next 10 years. Hall and Randall had previously owned several small entrepreneurial ventures. Randall was the Godson of J. Presper Eckert and had been involved with computers from childhood. Hall's father had been involved with modems from the earliest days of datacomm - so each brought special skills to the project.  Early designs of automated trading  Like later Internet based e-commerce systems such as eBay, sellers uploaded inventory to a database, buyers browsed inventory online but in this pre-Internet era, they consummated transactions by telephone. Buyers then paid Sellers, Sellers shipped goods to Buyers and the Exchange billed the seller a commission. After several years of operations and some bad transactions, the Exchange invented an escrow services to protect buyers, sellers and the Exchange itself. The absence of a verifiable way to close credit card transactions on-line prevented an \\"all on- line\\" trade system. In 1986, the Exchange created an electronic trading system that was showcased at the COMDEX Trade Show in Las Vegas which attracting wide attention to their vision of an all-electronic, all \\"on-line\\" system for buying and selling all types of equipment. The BCENE auction trading system pre-dated all other efforts to create on-line trade and was widely viewed as a major innovation in how commerce would be conducted in all business areas. Standard Oil Company brought BoCoEx under contract and secured all rights to the system seeking advice on how to create a world-scale on-line trading system. Standard Oil pursued this for several years until that oil company was sold to British Petroleum and the idea was shelved but not scrapped. Standard Oil tried to sell the idea and the BoCoEx contracts to other companies and eventually abandoned the effort and released Randall and Hall from their exclusive consulting contracts.  BoCoEx Index  On advice from futurist Wes Thomas, the Boston Computer Exchange created a weekly price report - called the BoCoEx Index, a report on the High, Low and Closing Price on the Exchange for the most popular computer models. Starting in 1983, this price list became a standard tool for assessing the value of computers in court cases, after market sales and in valuations of assets in corporate mergers and acquisitions. The report was published every week in ComputerWorld and PC Week magazines. The report dominated the used computer after market and was a standard news item in other computer magazines, much like stock prices in a daily newspaper. The BoCoEx Index was also a regular feature on the Business Radio Network and was used to create a ten-year report on the price declines of popular computer models.  Seat on the Exchange  The founders sought to create trading partners to trade on the exchange and they wrote a book of instructions called a \\"Seat on the Exchange.\\" It was first offered in 1986 and expanded in several subsequent editions. The book was a set of tools for creating a free standing computer trading enterprise in any city. At the peak there were 150 \\"Computer Exchanges\\" that had licensed technology from Boston Computer Exchange. Among them were the Southern Computer Exchange, The NaComEx, and \\"seats\\" in such places as San Francisco, Virginia, Maryland, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York, and as far afield as Santiago Chile, Stockholm and Leningrad in Russia. The \\"Seat\\" book detailed the operations of the business and provided access to a national database operating on a private server. Randall also authored the \\"Used Computer Handbook\\" for Microsoft Press in 1990 which detailed how to safely buy and sell computers in the after market. NY Times article on BCE and Seat Book  Decomposition and demise  On Jan 1, 1990, Randall and Hall sold the Exchange to ValCom - a computer retailer - and that business did not choose to vigorously pursue the on-line aspects of the Boston Computer Exchange - rather they focused on using the Exchange to sell excess inventory from the ValCom Stores. Nevertheless, the Exchange did create an \\"All Auctions\\" system in the early 1990s. The whole enterprise was later sold to Compaq Corporation and subsequently to Hewlett- Packard. The Boston Computer Exchange eventually ceased to operate and was closed. Hall died of cancer in 1998. Randall is presently professor of communication at the University of the Virgin Islands.

Working at the bank provided him with an opportunity to see a business advantage. With just $100.00 he founded the Peabody, Daniels & Company, at age 24 in 1883, in Chicago, Illinois.\\"Humble Roots\\" at Peabody Energy Peabody Coal started out as a retail coal vendor, buying coal and re-selling it to retail consumers to use in their homes and businesses. Peabody married May Henderson in 1887. He bought out his business partner in 1889, and incorporated the Peabody Coal Company in the state of Illinois in 1890. In 1894, Peabody ran unsuccessfully for Sheriff of Chicago. By 1905, Peabody was the president and director of ten companies. May Peabody died in 1907 after bearing one son and two years later, Peabody married Mary Gertrude Sullivan. The Peabodys moved to the Francis Stuyvesant Peabody House in Hinsdale, Illinois in 1911. An important political ally of Adlai E. Stevenson I, Peabody was considered as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party in 1912. During World War I, Peabody was the chairman of the Coal Production Committee of the Council of National Defense and was assistant to the director of the Bureau of Mines. In 1919, Peabody stepped down as president of the company at the age of 60 in favor of his son Stuyvesant. By 1920 Peabody Coal Company was one of the largest coal companies in the United States. Peabody Coal is now Peabody Energy, currently the largest private-sector coal company in the world. A long-time member and president of Hinsdale Golf Club, Peabody spearheaded the creation of the Chicago District Golf Association. His primary vision was for a local governing body that was focused on caddy welfare and conducting amateur golf tournaments throughout the Midwest. He constructed the Mayslake Peabody Estate in Oak Brook, Illinois. The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Only a year after Mayslake Hall was completed, Francis Peabody died of a heart attack during a fox hunt on his property. He was 63. Peabody had amassed a personal fortune of $35 million and a business fortune of $75 million. Thoroughbred racing In 1919 Francis Peabody began purchasing racehorses for the purpose of creating a stable of runners to compete in the sport of Thoroughbred racing. Although he had only been involved in racing for a few years he had an impact and his son, Stuyvesant Peabody, would continue the racing stable and eventually became President of the Lincoln Fields Jockey Club, owners of Lincoln Fields Race Track. The Francis S. Peabody Memorial Handicap was created in his honor at Washington Park Race Track with the inaugural running on June 29, 1929.

It was established on 10 February 1943. The remains of the radar station were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 July 2008. History The radar station was built by the Allied Works Council to monitor enemy airborne threats during World War II. It was one of nine Advanced Chain Overseas (ACO) radar installations on mainland Australia. The War Cabinet had originally intended to have 32 units to implement the plan for Australia's radar station chain, but this became difficult to achieve and later unnecessary after significant events that changed the course of the war. The ACO radar equipment sent to Australia was originally intended for other territories such as Malaya and Singapore but diverted after Japanese invasion of these countries. Radar Station 208 was sited on a ridge 93m above sea level amongst dense woodland overlooking the ocean. The transmitter and receiver towers were over 44 metres in height and spaced 100metres apart to ensure that radio pulses were received as echoes and not confused with transmissions. The floodlight system of the ACO radars required a high volume of electrical power sourced from power mains with backup generator located in a smaller dedicated bunker. Bombproof bunkers, meant to be underground, housed the electronics for transmitter and receiver, each console weighing two tonnes. According to RAAF records, \\"No. 208 RDF Station formed to establishment No. HD 318 of Mine Camp, NSW on 10th February 1943 under the control of H.Q. Eastern Area. The purpose of the unit is, by means of Radio Direction Finding to locate and promulgate advice of enemy and other aircraft approaching to locality of the station\\". At its establishment it had a total of 41 personnel consisting of 1 RAAF Officer, 1 WAAAF Officer, 14 RAAF and 25 WAAAF, the personnel levels peaked in May 1943 with a total of 54. The radar Operators were from the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). The radar mechanics were from the Royal Australian Air Force. The unit also included guards, cooks and other trades. The Operators communicated plotted data to the Fighter Unit in Newcastle by land line or radio telephone. The radar operator monitored aircraft activity from an eleven-inch cathode ray tube screen. Using the goniometre consisting of switches and controls of the direction and height finding components, the operator would alter the screen and make comparisons to decipher the direction, elevation and distance of the aircraft. The radar mechanics were required to regularly climb the radar towers to service relay switches and aerials. The ACO, a fixed radar station, had some advantages over others with its quick height finding capabilities and ability to monitor aircraft movements up to 200 miles. The radar station also served RAAF Base Rathmines, monitoring movements of Catalinas and other aircraft. Plotted data was communicated to the command centre, Fighter Station No 2 located 26 km north of the installation. In August 1944 No. 208 Radar Station RAAF ceased to be a 24-hour operation and personnel numbers were steadily reduced until 28 January 1947 when it was disbanded.  Associated sites - Mine Camp  RAAF and WAAAF personnel of Radar Station 208 were stationed at a small township near Catherine Hill Bay below the radar station, which once served as a camp during the early mining period. The first shipment of coal from the area was made in 1873 by the New Wallsend Coal Company. Initially a shanty town served the miners but by the 1870s a miners settlement was established boasting 20 houses.Newcastle Herald 1987 The arrival of forty five WAAAF and RAAF personnel doubled the townships population which had one shop and a post office. Additional living quarters were erected for personnel that imitated the existing housing within the township for camouflage purposes. Some civilians remained at Mine Camp village and, soon after the war, the Housing Commission of New South Wales acquired the RAAF property, yet numbers declined and the post office closed in 1952. In 1969 twelve dwellings remained. In 1969 twelve dwellings remained and soon after the Housing Commission of New South Wales acquired the property. In the 1980s the village was destroyed by bush fire. Commanding officers * A.J. Ryan (FlgOff) ‚Äì 10 January 1943 * A.G.L. Price (FlgOff) ‚Äì 2 June 1943 * R.S.

There are two arrangements of four concrete footings that originally supported 44 metre timber aerial towers. The footings are arranged in a square pattern with remnant steel supports protruding from each block. Two concrete above ground igloo shaped bunkers remain, each with a square turret on the seaward side. The footings and bunkers are symmetrically placed across an east-west axis. The bunkers have remnants of electrical fittings and recessed areas on the internal walls and concrete slab floors and an egress on the eastern walls. The southern area has a remnant rectangular shaped concrete support for the tower ladder rising several centimetres above the ground surface. The northern area has a remnant concrete stair structure of approximately half a metre high with three steps and the outer rim concrete remains of a depressed circular structure. A two-metre safety fence, erected in the 1990s, is located on the northern and eastern boundary and isolates the footings and other above surface remains in the northern section. The eastern side of the northern bunker is one and a half metres from the cliff edge. The southern sector arrangement of footings was reported to be well preserved and obscured by dense regrowth vegetation as at 7 February 2006. The northern sector footings were reported to show a greater level of deterioration with exposure to coastal conditions. The concrete bunkers have been subject to graffiti and fire but remain in good condition. There is some evidence of concrete cancer to the buildings in the form of exposed reinforcing where minor concrete spalling has occurred.  Heritage listing  The former RAAF Radar Station 208 at Catherine Hill Bay, comprising remains of the RAAF radar installation is significant as a rare example of NSW's participation in the WWII network of air warning radar, established in strategic locations along Australia's coast during World War II. It is one of nine ACO radar stations established on mainland Australia using British imported ACO radar and the only remaining site of the two established in NSW. Its location and siting on an elevated coastal area amongst dense bushland demonstrates Australia's response to the threat of invasion and the importance placed on protecting the industrial centres along NSW coastline during WWII. The site has potential to yield further information about Australian coastal defence efforts during WWII and the use and development of radar technology. It has historical associations with the introduction, use and development of radar technology in Australia which is regarded as one of the greatest contributions of Australian science to the war effort. The wartime development of radar in Australia became a key element in the shift towards government sponsored applied scientific researchMacLeod 1999 and the gradual independence of Australian science. After the war, radar became a celebrated achievement of science in Australia.

The highway begins at an intersection with National Routes 36 and 230 in Sapporo. It travels northeast across the western side of Hokkaido to Asahikawa where it ends at an intersection with National Routes 39 and 40. Route description National Route 12 is a highway in western Hokkaido that runs north from Sapporo to Asahikawa. Its southern terminus lies at an intersection in Ch≈´≈ç-ku, Sapporo where it meets National Routes 36 and 230. Along the way from Sapporo to Asahikawa, it passes through the cities of Ebetsu, Iwamizawa, Takikawa, and Fukagawa. The highway is closely paralleled by the tolled D≈ç-≈å Expressway and it functions as free alternative route to the expressway between Sapporo and Asahikawa. A notable section of the highway between the cities of Bibai and Takikawa is known for being the longest straight section of roadway in Japan. Marked as being long, there is actually a slight curve in Takikawa, bringing the actual length of the straight section of the road down to . Its northern terminus in Asahikawa is the intersection where it meets National Routes 39 and 40. History National Route 12 in eastern Sapporo during the winter National Route 12 was preceded by the Kamikawa Road, an , Meiji period road built to link the current cities of Mikasa and Asahikawa. Ordered by Genr≈çin secretary Kaneko Kentar≈ç, construction on the road began in April 1886. It was completed in 90 days by making use of prison labor from the prisoners that were to be incarcerated at Abashiri Prison in northeastern Hokkaido. The prison laborers were mainly political dissidents that Kaneko viewed as morally deficient. Construction of the Kamikawa Road and the others leading from the more-developed southern part of Hokkaido to the prison were of strategic importance to Japan, which viewed Hokkaido as being vulnerable to an invasion from their neighbor, the Russian Empire. On 4 December 1952 the highway was designated by the Cabinet of Japan as Primary National Highway 12 between Sapporo and Asahikawa. On 1 April 1965 it was reclassified as General National Highway 12 without any changes being made to its routing. Major junctions The route lies entirely within Hokkaido. Auxiliary routes=Takikawa Bypass Takikawa Bypass northeast of central Takikawa The Takikawa Bypass is a auxiliary route of National Route 12 that travels to the east and north of the central district of Takikawa. From its southern terminus with its parent route, it heads north and crosses over the Sorachi River. It has a junction with National Route 38. After this junction the Takikawa Bypass travels northeast, paralleling the main line of National Route 12 until it reaches Hokkaido Route 776. From there it heads northwest towards its northern terminus at a junction with National Route 12. Asahikawa Shind≈ç The Asahikawa Shind≈ç is a auxiliary route of National Route 12 that travels to the west and north of the central district of Asahikawa. From its southern terminus with its parent route, it heads north and crosses over the Ishikari River. After that it curves to the northeast and has a junction with the D≈ç-≈å Expressway. North of central Asahikawa the highway curves to the southeast. It meets National Route 40 just before crossing over the Ishikari River once more. The highway then meets its northern terminus at an intersection with National Route 39.

Dyer, daughter of the builder, and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 8 February 1862, Lt. George M. Ransom in command. She was sent to join the forces then gathering to attack the defenses of New Orleans. On 24 April 1862, Kineo was one of the ships that battled their way past Forts Jackson and Saint Philip. Though hit by enemy cannon fire, she was able to continue up the Mississippi River and participate in the capture of the Confederacy's largest seaport. Kineo continued her operations on the lower Mississippi for more than a year. She took part in engagements at Grand Gulf on 26 May, Baton Rouge in early August, Donaldsonville, Louisiana in October and Port Hudson in December 1862. On 14 March 1863, Kineo was tied alongside USS Monongahela for a run past enemy fortifications at Port Hudson. Their efforts were thwarted when Monongahela's rudder was disabled, but the gunboat was able to pull her larger consort out of danger. In August 1863, following further actions along the river, Kineo was sent north for repairs. Returning to the Gulf of Mexico in March 1864, Kineo spent most of that year off the Texas coast, capturing one blockade running schooner during that time. In December, she went back to the Mississippi, where she was stationed until April 1865. After the war USS Kineo was decommissioned in May 1865, as the Civil War was coming to an end, and was sold in October 1866. She later became the merchant schooner Lucy H. Gibson.

Within two years more than fifty whaleships were cruising for sperm whales on this ground.Starbuck (1878), p. 96 During the first voyage on the Maria, George discovered an island in the Austral group which he named Maria, but has also been known as \\"Hull Island\\" and \\"Sands Island\\".Dunmore, pp 114-115 In his 1828 report, JN Reynolds credited George with the discovery of various other islands: > Captain George Washington Gardner discovered the following islands, &c.;, > which are not laid down on any of the charts: An island, north latitude 30 > degrees, east longitude 144 degrees; An island, north latitude 39 degrees, > east longitude 39 degrees; An island, north latitude 30 degrees, east > longitude 44 degrees 20 minutes; Rocks, north latitude 31 degrees, east > longitude 155 degrees; An island, north latitude 37 degrees, east longitude. > On the coast of New Albion, an island, north latitude 33 degrees, west > longitude 119 degrees 30 minutes.

Gideon Gardner Gideon (May 30, 1759 - March 22, 1832) was a successful shipmaster and ship owner; he is reputedly the owner of the whaleship Ganges, which discovered Gardner Island. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican Party to the Eleventh Congress (March 4, 1809 ‚Äì March 3, 1811). John Gardner Reynolds also reported island discoveries by John Gardner, made while he was captaining the Atlantic a short time previously: > The first island, in north latitude 8 degrees 48 minutes, longitude 144 > degrees 35 minutes east. The second island, in north latitude 1 degree 7 > minutes, longitude 165 degrees east. The third island, a cluster, south > latitude 2 degrees 15 minutes, longitude 152 degrees 5 minutes east. Also, a > cluster of reefs and shoals, extending N.N.E. and S.S.W. between the > latitudes of 1 degree 35 minutes and 2 degrees 15 minutes south, and > longitude 153 degrees 45 minutes and 153 degrees 15 minutes east. John > Weeks, second officer, saw an island in 2 degrees north, longitude 150 > degrees east, one mile long, surrounded by a coral reef six miles from > shore. This island is low, and abounds in cocoa nuts. Joshua Gardner A nineteenth century whaler, Joshua is often credited with the discovery of Gardner Island (Nikumaroro), in the Phoenix group in the Pacific Ocean. In the mid-1820s, Gardner commanded the whaleship Ganges, operating in the Pacific. He discovered an island in 1825, located at , and named it \\"Gardner's Island\\". His discovery was reported in the Nantucket Enquirer, December 1827.Dunmore, p 115 However, contemporary Joshua Coffin is sometimes credited with the discovery. During the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842, Charles Wilkes identified Gardner's Island from the reported position, and confirmed its existence.Sharp, p 213 Modern positioning places Nikumaroro (also known as Kimins Island) at 4¬∞40' S, 174¬∞31 W.

Biography  Lithograph created by Prestele of Rubus crataegifolius (Korean Raspberry) and Rubus ursinus (California Blackberry). Prestele was born on October 13, 1838, in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany, to Franz Joseph Martin Prestele and Karoline Russ. The family emigrated to America in 1843, settling first in New York and later in the Amana Colonies in Iowa. His father, known in America as Joseph Prestele, was also a painter and lithographer of flowers and fruits and prior to emigrating had been head gardener for King Ludwig I of Bavaria as well as a staff artist for a time at the Royal Botanical Garden in Munich. From his father he learned the arts of watercolor and lithography. In the late 1850s, Prestele moved to New York, and in 1861 he joined the Union Army as a private in a regiment of New York volunteers. He was wounded at the battle of Antietam in 1862 and spent the remainder of his service period recovering in hospital. Sometime around 1863, he married an Irish woman named Anne, and with her he had three children‚ÄîMargaret (1864), Frances (ca. 1869), and Emma (1870)‚Äîbefore Anne died in 1871 or 1872. In 1867, at the age of 29, William was hired to make a series of nurserymen‚Äôs plates by Illinois nursery owner Franklin Kelsey Phoenix. He moved his family from New York to Bloomington, Illinois, for this project. No plates from this project are known to have survived, but a write- up in the August 1869 edition of Gardener's Monthly and Horticultural Advertiser praised them in robust terms: \\"We have now before us a fruit piece... prepared by W. H. Prestele. We are in the habit of admiring European art in this line, and have often wished Americans could successfully compete with it. We now have it here. We never saw anything of the kind better executed from any part of the world\\". When this relationship ended in 1871, William briefly went into business with L. B. Littlefield, publishing fruit and flower plates. In 1875, he moved his family to Iowa, not far from the Amana community where he was raised, and married his second wife, Susanna Gefaller. With Susanna, who died in 1882, he had a daughter, Lillian. He set up as a lithographer in Iowa City and practiced this trade for a decade or so. Watercolor of wild cherry (Prunus avium) by William Henry Prestele, 1892. On August 1, 1887, he was appointed as the first artist on the staff of the recently formed Pomological Division of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. He was assigned to make life-size watercolors of native grapes intended as illustrations for a monograph by Thomas Volney Munson of Denison, Texas, a leading authority on native grapes. He worked from live and dried specimens sent to him by Munson, making color sketches of details that Munson would then review; Prestele would then use these detail drawings would to create a life-size painting of the species. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture eventually decided the cost of printing the monograph with the illustrations would be prohibitive, so it was never published in its intended form, though Munson went on to use the text he wrote as the foundation for his highly regarded book Foundations of American Grape Culture. Munson's book was illustrated with photographs instead of with Prestele's watercolors, which remained in the collection of the USDA. Prestele's paintings are noted for their naturalness and attention to botanical accuracy. Over a hundred of his watercolors of grapes and other fruit are held in the National Agricultural Library's Pomological Watercolor Collection. He died in Arlington, Virginia on August 16, 1895, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. A collection of his papers spanning the years 1887-1891 is held by the USDA National Agricultural Library Special Collections and comprises original watercolors and drawings, plant specimens, and other materials, including work related to the planned Munson monograph.

Criminal records may include arrest, conviction, and possibly criminal proceedings. A police certificate is also known as good citizen certificate (in Hong Kong), good conduct certificate, police clearance certificate, national police history check (in Australia) or judicial record extracts. Applicants may have to submit fingerprints and certain personal information to request a criminal record check, and the police or government agency may charge a fee. Purposes A police certificate may be required if the applicant is: *Applying for vocational positions requiring clearance; *Seeking to immigrate or obtain visas; and *Satisfying an individual employer's request. Scope Depending on each country's law, applicants may be required to submit police certificates of countries which they have stayed beyond periods as specified by law. *Australia: For citizenship applications, countries where applicants have resided for 3 months or more if the applicants have been outside Australia for more than 12 months since acquiring permanent residency; for visa applications, countries where applicants have resided for 12 months or more. *Canada: Countries where applicants have resided for 6 months or more. U.S. citizens applying for permanent residence and some other services in Canada may be required to furnish FBI and local police certificates from the United States. *Ecuador: Country where applicants have principally resided during the last 5 years. *New Zealand: Countries where applicants have resided for 12 months or more. *United States: Countries where applicants have resided for 6 months or more. Period of Validity A police certificate may or may not have a period of validity noted on the certificate, and criteria for recognizing the validity of certificates vary widely. The criteria which different countries use to determine the validity of certificates are often independent of any dates or validity periods noted on certificates themselves. Australia, for example, recognizes police certificates for 12 months from their issue dates for both visa and citizenship applications, independent of any validity period noted on the certificates themselves. Ecuador, in stark contrast, only recognizes police certificates (as of 2 March 2012) issued within 3 months of the date the certificates are presented (e.g., for a visa application), again independent of any dates or validity periods noted explicitly on the certificates themselves. As in many countries, determining the validity periods of police certificates is often neither mandated nor noted in any legislation. In Australia, for instance, the approach has simply been adopted by Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship for the sake of consistency across varying jurisdictions; in Ecuador, in contrast, the approach has been adopted by the Department of the Interior. Example: Police Checks in Australia In Australia, individuals can request a police check which itemizes disclosable court outcomes. All police checks must be undertaken with the informed consent of the person being checked, unless the check is mandated by relevant legislation.https://www.acic.gov.au/our- services/national-police-checks This means that persons cannot validly obtain a police check on another individual without that individuals permission. Businesses can request a police check on the applicant behalf A person may be required to present a Police Clearance Certificate as part of employment screening, as a pre-requisite for volunteer work, as preparation for a court appearance, to apply for a visa to enter/stay in some countries, or to satisfy a statutory requirement. Individuals may seek a national criminal history check through two ways: # Their local police service. # An ACIC accredited ‚Äúbroker‚Äù (e.g. a commercial background checking service provider authorised to conduct national criminal history checks for and on behalf of its customer). Accredited Agencies are listed on Australia's ACIC website. Regardless of whether the applicant applied for a police check through one of the eight state police agencies or the Australian Federal Police, or an ACIC approved broker, all police checks are completed through ACIC's National Police Checking Service. Applicants who will receive a certificate titled a \\"National Police Check\\" if the background check was completed by one of the police agencies, or a \\"National Criminal History Certificate\\" if completed by an ACIC approved broker. In some cases, Commonwealth agencies such as the Department of Immigration and Border Protection only accept police checks issued by the AFP if used in support of citizenship or immigration-related decisions.https://www.afpcheck.com/faq In Australia, whilst CrimTrac completes all background checks regardless of the requesting agency, the results that are disclosed for an individual may vary depending on: # The purpose of the background or police check; # The accredited agency‚Äôs coordinating police agency (e.g. which state the agency‚Äôs head office is domiciled); and # Any relevant State or Territory legislation and/or policies regarding police history information release. Majority of National Coordinated Criminal History Check (Police Check) results are returned within 1-3 business days. In the event it takes longer than this, it will likely have been forwarded to Australian Police Agencies for further processing. https://www.australiannationalcharactercheck.com.au If for any reason the applicant does not agree with the results of their police check, he or she should contact the agency where the police check was submitted so that CrimTrac can initiate a review process.

The song has achieved a large amount of popularity in both the mainstream and Christian radio. The song was No. 1 on ChristianRock.Net's Weekly Top 30 for sixteen straight weeks, No. 3 on their Annual Top 100, and was the most requested song of the year in 2006. The song also charted at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart.

You know, whether that's a second chance at life, or at a relationship, or when they think they've screwed something up too bad. And in this song it's basically saying it's never too late to start all over again, it's a message of hope and a lot of people aren't feeling very hopeful these days in our world.\\" Music video A music video was shot for this video at the same time as the video for \\"Whispers in the Dark\\", and the two were released around the CD release at the same time. The \\"Rebirthing\\" video consists of the band playing in a very bright room with windows showing the sky outside (whereas the \\"Whispers\\" video takes place in a dark room filled with rain and rose petals). There are many flashes of a city from above, a man being grabbed by hands from his computer, and finally, a butterfly (to show the song's meaning of new life).

It also affected those consuming radium-laden patent medicines. The symptoms are necrosis of the mandible (lower jawbone) and the maxilla (upper jaw), constant bleeding of the gums, and (usually) after some time, severe distortion due to bone tumors and porosity of the lower jaw. The condition is similar to phossy jaw, an osteoporotic and osteonecrotic illness of matchgirls, brought on by phosphorus ingestion and absorption. The first written reference to the disease was by a dentist, Dr. Theodor Blum, in 1924, who described an unusual mandibular osteomyelitis in a dial painter, naming it \\"radium jaw\\". The disease was determined by pathologist Dr. H.S. Martland in 1924 to be symptomatic of radium paint ingestion, after many female workers from various radium paint companies reported similar dental and mandibular pain. Symptoms were present in the mouth due to use of the lips and tongue to keep the radium-paint paintbrushes properly shaped. The disease was the main reason for litigation against the United States Radium Corporation by the Radium Girls. Another prominent example of this condition was the death of American golfer and industrialist Eben Byers in 1932, after taking large doses of Radithor, a radioactive patent medicine containing radium, over several years. His illness garnered much publicity, and brought the problem of radioactive quack medicines into the public eye.

The first issue, #0, was released in October 1994 by Fantagraphics Books, and a second issue, #1, was released the following January. A third issue (#2) was announced in the pages of other Fantagraphics publications and solicited in Previews but was never published. \\"I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool\\", a color short story with a markedly different art style originally intended for issue #2, appeared instead in the anthology Zero Zero. In a 2010 interview, Columbia recalled that the unfinished issue \\"looked so different that it just didn‚Äôt look right, it didn‚Äôt look consistent, and it didn‚Äôt feel right to keep putting out that same comic book, to try to tell a story where the style is mutating.\\" The series' title is taken from a passage in the William S. Burroughs book Exterminator! (in the chapter \\"Short Trip Home\\"). The passage in question is quoted briefly in a story from issue #0, also titled \\"The Biologic Show\\". Each issue of The Biologic Show contains several short stories and illustrated poems. Many of the pieces deal with disturbing subject matter such as mutilation, incest, and the occult. Issue #0 introduces three of Columbia's recurring characters: the hapless, Koko the Clown-like Seymour Sunshine in the opening story \\"No Tomorrow If I Must Return\\", and the sibling duo Pim and Francie in \\"Tar Frogs\\". (Both \\"Tar Frogs\\" and the aforementioned \\"The Biologic Show\\" had originally appeared in the British comics magazine Deadline but were partially redrawn for Columbia's solo book.) Issue #1 is dominated by the 16-page Pim and Francie story \\"Peloria: Part One\\", intended as the start of an ongoing serial. It includes another character, Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy, who reappears in Columbia's later work. Upon the demise of The Biologic Show Fantagraphics announced that Peloria would be released as a stand-alone graphic novel,\\"Zero Welcomes...\\".

The permanent collection includes examples of 19th- and 20th-century American paintings and sculpture, Southern regional art, Old Master prints and decorative arts. It is also home to ARTWORKS, a participatory art gallery and studio for children. The current building was designed by the Montgomery architectural firm of Barganier, Davis, and Sims and opened in 1988. An addition was completed in 1993. History The Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1930 with the mission \\"to collect, preserve, exhibit, and interpret art of the highest quality for the enrichment, enlightenment, and enjoyment of its public.\\" The museum is the oldest fine arts museum in Alabama and was the first museum in Alabama to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in June 1978. The museum moved to its current home in the Blount Cultural Park, in 1988. The museum's permanent collection consists of paintings, sculpture, and works on paper that represent the work of artists of national as well as regional reputation. The core of the American collection is the Blount Collection of American Art, a group of forty-one paintings that includes works by John Singer Sargent, Edward Hopper, and Winslow Homer. The MMFA has a collection of Old Master prints, including works by Rembrandt, D√ºrer, and Whistler. The museum hosts a broad range of temporary exhibitions with art from international and American collections as well as works by contemporary artists. Another lakeside view of the museum. The MMFA's art reference library has more than 4,000 volumes, periodicals, videotapes, and CDs, available to those needing information or doing research. One major component of the education program is ARTWORKS, an interactive gallery designed to interpret items from the Museum's permanent collection through hands-on exhibits. The ARTWORKS gallery attracts over 60,000 people each year. Other programs for youth include a preschool puppet show; a tour program for every third grade student in Montgomery Public Schools; after school programs for under-served youth, and the AP Art History Course that allows high school students to earn college credit. Educational programming is offered through workshops, tours, lectures, and other activities. From an annual attendance of 160,000 visitors, the museum estimates that roughly half of its visitors participate in an educational offering. The MMFA receives approximately two-thirds of its annual budget from the city and county of Montgomery, with the remainder provided through the MMFA Association, a private support group. Corporate and individual memberships comprise the largest source of MMFA Association revenue. Additional income is generated through the Museum Shop, special events, catalog sales and program fees. The Museum recently completed an $8 million capital campaign for endowment and building expansion. The new Education Wing, dedicated in March 2007, provides gallery space and doubled the size of the ARTWORKS interactive gallery and studio space. This expansion allows the museum to more fully accommodate the demands of growing public interest. The museum is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program. The museum opened the John and John Caddell Sculpture garden in 2018, on three acres as part of the adjoining park. The garden features traveling exhibits from throughout the world.

Abel contributed his song Hospice for Destitute Lovers, and voice, as the character of Gert, to Florian Habicht's art-noir feature film Woodenhead (2003). His debut album Little Death, recorded by Nick Abbott at Montage Studios in Grey Lynn, garnered favourable reviews when released in February 2006. It featured a \\"Kiwi supergroup\\" of notable New Zealand musicians including Geoff Maddock of Goldenhorse and Bressa Creeting Cake; Mike Hall and Milan Borich of Pluto; and Gareth Thomas of Goodshirt; and guest vocals by Kirsten Morell, also of Goldenhorse. Little Death was awarded the Alternatui for 2006 Album of the Year. Abel's second album Flax Happy, featured the same band as his debut under the name The Chrysalids (after the 1955 novel by John Wyndham). It was recorded mainly at Roundhead Studios by Dale Cotton in July 2007. Two songs featuring Texan chanteuse Jolie Holland were recorded by Lee Prebble at The Surgery in Wellington. Flax Happy was released in 2008 (NZ) and 2009 (UK) to critical acclaim in both territories. Journalist Graham Reid described Abel as, \\"A refined writer whose lyrics have a bone-bare quality ‚Äì the sound of someone writing and singing from a place where there is no guile, just hard truth and clear eyes.\\" Having moved to live in Geneva in 2008, and encouraged by fellow musician Delaney Davidson, Abel entered and won The Saddest Song in the World Competition in Berlin in May 2009. He played at the CMJ music festival in New York later that year, and in November began recording his third album Luck/Hope with Jolie Holland, Shahzad Ismaily and Grey Gersten at Manhattan's Rivington 66 Studio.  Activism  Abel was involved from 1998 to 2000 in the successful campaign by Native Forest Action to stop native logging on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island. He later worked as a campaigner for Greenpeace from 2002 to 2006 during which time he was prominent in the New Zealand movement against genetically engineered food crops. He was also involved in actions against the proposed coal-fired power station Marsden B in Northland, New Zealand including a nine-day occupation in 2005 and the operation of a pirate radio station Heatwave FM which broadcast from Ruakaka in November 2006. The Marsden B proposal was later abandoned. Abel was one of the coordinators of the re- recording of the Don McGlashan song \\"Anchor Me\\" in 2005 to mark the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. Returning to Greenpeace in 2010, he helped coordinate the historic March Against Mining which took place in Queen Street Auckland on 1 May 2010. The march, later contributing to a government back-down on proposed mining of high-value conservation estate, was reported as the \\"biggest protest in a generation\\". He campaigned in 2011 with Te WhƒÅnau-a-Apanui against the Brazilian oil company Petrobras‚Äô plans for deep sea oil drilling in the Raukumara Basin which included a flotilla that spent 42 days at sea. Petrobras relinquished their drill permits in December 2012. Abel has publicly advocated for peaceful civil disobedience as a means to resisting the oil industry and achieving political action to address climate change. He will contest the New Lynn electorate at the 2020 general election as the Green Party candidate. He currently resides in Auckland. On 21 July 2020 Abel was arrested when protesting the removal of 30 native trees on private property in Avondale, Auckland.

J√≥zsef Angster (7 July 1834 ‚Äì 9 June 1918) was a Hungarian organ making master and founder of the Angster dynasty, one of Central Europe's most sought after in the craft, an important figure in Hungarian applied arts history. Origins Angster was born at K√°csfalu, in present-day Croatia into a German family who had travelled to Hungary from Austria in the 1790s. He wrote his memoirs in German, they were translated in his old age into Hungarian, he later said that in speaking Hungarian he was a beginner, and in writing it he was an unschooled senior. Studies He studied cabinet making then travelled to Timi»ôoara and worked in Germany. He studied organ manufacturing in Vienna at the Titz factory and from 1863 to 1866 worked in Paris under Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll where he also worked on the organs of Cologny castle, Notre Dame and Sainte-Trinit√©. He returned home on foot although he was asked to stay and work abroad. He was a deeply religious man and was made member of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by the Pope and was also president of the old boy's club in Pecs until his death. Life and work His first domestic commission was for the new Pecs synagogue and he founded a workshop in that city in 1869. In the following decades he received numerous commissions in Hungary and surrounding countries, including Italy. His domestic works include: *Kalocsa Cathedral. *P√©cs, Inner city R.C. church. *Budapest, Ter√©zv√°ros (Budapest) R.C. church. *P√©cs Cathedral, built in 1880, it was the 100th organ built by Angster. *Budapest, K√°lvin squ. Reformed church *Debrecen, Kossuth str. Reformed church *Gy≈ër Cathedral Legacy His legacy is the instruments he built. His name is attached to a Technical college in P√©cs, where he died, as well as one street in the city. After his death, the organ factory's business was run by Emil and Oskar Angster after 1903 and from 1940 to 1949 by Jozsef Angster, who had been born in 1917.

The state heritage listed Appian Way has been described as one of the finest streets of Federation houses in Australia. The picturesque houses create an asymmetrical, multi-gabled roofscape with a variety of materials used such as slate and terracotta tiles and feature varied designs. The houses are complemented with landscaped gardens, manicured lawns and a nature strip with Brush Box trees. The serpentine street runs between Burwood Road and Liverpool Road with a communal reserve that has been converted into a lawn tennis club. Homes in the street are designed in various Federation styles. Many are in the Federation Queen Anne style, but other styles are also represented. Erica and St Ellero are designed in the Federation Arts and Crafts style, while Casa Tasso and Ostia are just two out of several examples of the Federation Bungalow style.A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly, Angus and Robertson Publishers, 1994. Published in Australia History Also known as the Hoskins Estate, Appian Way was a model housing estate conceived by a wealthy industrialist, George J. Hoskins on 8 hectares of land that he purchased at the start of the 20th century. He bought the land, known as 'Humphreys Paddock' in April 1903, and submitted a proposal for an estate there by June of that year.Irving and Kinstler, p. 82 Burwood Council approved the project in August.Irving and Kinstler, p. 89 Built between 1903 and 1911, the estate of 36 Federation houses was created with his designer and builder William Richards to present an appropriate setting opposite the Hoskins St Cloud mansion on Burwood Road. They were not built to sell but as a long-term investment to be occupied by selected tenants of appropriate social standing.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990. Published in Australia The subdivisions were large (1,000-3,000 square metres), which allowed for spacious and low-set houses. The main thoroughfare itself, completed by 1905, is named after Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia), the most important ancient Roman road which connected Rome to Brindisi, Apulia in south-east Italy. Its meandering path heightened the informal tone of the estate, only now fully complemented by the mature trees.Irving and Kinstler, p. 90 Most houses focus on an oval-shaped village green that was originally intended for tennis, bowls and croquet.Fraser, p. 18 Additional tennis courts replaced the croquet lawn in 1909, and later the bowling green as well. Residents formed the Appian Way Recreation Club Limited in 1913, taking up 97 1 pound shares out of a capital of 200 pounds, with Hoskins' son Leslie (also a resident) holding the remainder as a majority shareholder. The green is surrounded by a picket fence and features hedges and an Edwardian pavilion clubhouse. Of the original 45 allotments, 36 houses were built, and 30 are still standing.Irving and Kinstler, p. 94 Hoskins allegedly planned for his niece to have them named after towns lying on the original Appian Way in Italy, but only four eventuated, a 'Roma', 'Brindisi', 'Capua', and 'Alba Longa' All bar two houses are single storey, 'Brianza' and the now-demolished 'Brindisi' gaining a second floor so they could capture some aspect of the green.Irving and Kinstler, p. 91 The street has become the backdrop for movies and television advertisements, such as the 1987 mini-series Vietnam.

Antonio Ponz (1725 ‚Äì 4 December 1792) was a Spanish painter. He was born at Bej√≠s in the province of Castell√≥n. He was a pupil of Antonio Richarte at Valencia, then in 1746 moved to Madrid, where he studied for five years. He then went to Rome for a short time, but soon returned to help in repainting and compilation of the artworks at El Escorial. In 1771 he made a journey through Spain. In 1776 he was appointed secretary of the Royal Academy of San Fernando. He was a member of many of the art academies in the Peninsula. He wrote Comentarios de la Pintura and several other works.  Biography  Ponz received a comprehensive education in the humanities, arts and theology at Segorbe, University of Valencia, Gandia and the School of the Three Arts in Madrid. He lived in Italy between 1751 and 1760, where he expanded his knowledge of art. There he met Pedro Francisco Jim√©nez de G√≥ngora y Luj√°n, Duke of Almodovar, who would become Director of the Spanish Royal Academy of History (1792‚Äì1794) and formed a friendship with Anton Raphael Mengs. He studied classical art under Johann Joachim Winckelmann and history with Francisco P√©rez Bayer. He settled in Rome and visited Naples in 1759 to view the newly discovered ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In 1773 he was elected scholar of history and in 1776 Secretary of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando was also a fellow of the Royal Basque Economic Society and the Economic society of Madrid, among other distinctions. Antonio Ponz was a key figure in Bourbon cultural policy and worked on the collection of works and relics of the Library of El Escorial, and was curator of the portrait gallery for which he made copies of some works by Italian masters.  Viaje de Espana (Journey around Spain)  Commissioned by Pedro Rodr√≠guez, Conde de Campomanes Ponz made a famous trip around Spain to inspect the artistic treasures of Andalucia that had belonged to the Jesuits, recently expelled from Spain by Carlos III (1767). Antonio P√©rez, secretary of King Philip II by Antonio Ponz, Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial Subsequently, Ponz published his famous Voyage around Spain (Viage de Espa√±a), a collection of letters in which there is news of the most significant events worthy of knowing. The work began in 1772 and was printed in the workshop of Joaqu√≠n Ibarra, although as a precaution, the author published the first two under an assumed name. According to his nephew Joseph Ponz this was, at the request of the Eugenio de Llaguno Duke of Almod√≥var and Francisco P√©rez Bayer among others. An eighteenth volume was printed posthumously in 1794 which referred to Cadiz, M√°laga and other towns in Andalucia. This work was not just an inventory of monuments and a documentary report on the conservation of artistic, epigraphic, and pictorial heritage, but also covered sculpture and architecture and other fixed works of significance that he saw in the course of his voyage. His description of them is strongly influenced by the Renaissance and Neoclassical movements and offer a much broader vision than other writers on many aspects of social reality in the country at the time, albeit with less detail than Eugenio Larruga. From some of the early volumes published it is easy to see he did not like the situation in the country, because it was thinly inhabited and little or poorly exploited. He noted that domestic markets were poorly served and sensed a certain crisis in artistic creation in relation to other, more enlightened times. This was during the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth century, and Ponz deplored the excesses of the Baroque style. In recognition of his work King Carlos III granted him the ecclesiastical revenues of the Stipend of Cuervo from the Archbishop of Toledo, and used his influence to have him appointed as the Secretary of the Academy of San Fernando (1776). In 1785 Ponz published Voyage beyond Spain (Viaje fuera de Espa√±a) which documented the tour he took around Europe in 1783 with the dual purpose of defending Spain from adverse travel reviews and contributing external philosophical ideas to the economic, social and artistic evolution within Spain. It is a journey representing the aspirations and tensions of enlightened reformers. Under the critical spotlight he was to flourish in the light and shadow of the French Revolution. He also sampled the economic and social dynamism and political freedom of Britain, the intellectual and religious tolerance in the United Provinces and the bitter memories of the Spanish occupation of The Netherlands. Although his work is concerned primarily with artistic description, it also includes reflections on the economy, as well as the social and religious life abroad, and, more darkly, the foreign policies in the territories visited. Assigned to moderate reformism and no supporter of breaks, our author advocates the involvement of the nobility, through economic development and the patronage, in the progress of the country, while avoiding reference to sociability and everyday life. In art, he goes in the name of \\"good taste\\" neoclassical some selected readers, while perceived growing importance of the public and the market in the world of art. In the religious and political freedoms horrified rejects English and Dutch, without actually sense the impending revolutionary storm in France. Who liked to call himself a \\"modernario\\" embodies well compared to other international travelers as Gaspar de Molina and Saldivar, better known as Marquis of Ure√±a, or Leandro Fernandez de Morat√≠n, face a more disciplined Illustration contained and respectful of the Church, the monarchy and order estates.

The town is in the Walgett Shire local government area. In 2016, the town had a population of 158. The name of the town is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning 'you carry'.  History  In 1818 John Oxley and George Evans arrived north of Warren and attempted to come down the Macquarie River. Unseasonal rains and swollen rivers overflowing into marsh country soon turned them back, confirming their conviction that there was an inland sea. For ten years the mystery of the inland sea remained unsolved. When Charles Sturt ventured into the interior in 1828-29 he endeavoured to verify Oxley's findings. However, it became evident that there was no inland sea, and that all the inland rivers did flow into the Darling River. Settlers came into the Carinda District in the mid 1800s settling along the waterways. Thomas McNamara acquired of land which became Carinda Station. He built a dwelling on the nearby Marthaguy Creek where he ran a hotel and a store around which a small village grew. It is believed the name Carinda is derived from an early 'run' west of the present town called 'Currundy.' In 1908 the Carinda Bore was sunk, enabling people to move away from the creek. A second settlement, known as the \\"Top End\\", grew up where present-day Carinda is situated.  Present day The population of Carinda has decreased significantly in the past 16 years and now stands at around 158. In the 2016 Census 87.3% of people were born in Australia and 88.9% of people only spoke English at home. The general store which also served as a post office and caf√© closed down in August 2014, and post office duties have since been taken up by the local service station. The town was used as a filming location for the video for singer David Bowie's 1983 single \\"Let's Dance\\", centering on the Carinda Hotel.Bowie at the bar: How Let's Dance put an outback pub in the spotlight ABC News 12 January 2016 The connection to Bowie has been proposed for plans to revitalize the town.

For a time, he escapes his fate in the Belt by being inducted into the crew of an ore hauler, where for a while he contemplates his life and comes to the conclusion that he was set up. Ultimately he falls for the captain's beautiful young daughter Addie. When the same forces responsible for the destruction of the skytower destroy the freighter, Mance manages to survive by having been outside, tethered to the ship as punishment from the captain for having been caught with his daughter. Rescued against all odds, Mance is brought to the moon to recuperate, where he is able to assume the identity of the ship's late first officer, Dante Alexios, by undergoing extensive nano reconstruction to make him appear outwardly identical to Dante Alexios. With his new persona, Mance/Dante leads a successful engineering career, which empowers him to plot his revenge against those whom he blames for his downfall: the simple but good-natured New Morality clergyman Elliott Danvers, and Molina (who has since married Lara with whom he has a child) and the Yamagata Corporation. Mance lures the three to Mercury where he manages to infiltrate the Yamagata operations and cause financially ruinous delays to their Mercurian project by planting Martian rock samples containing organic compounds there. These he allows to be discovered by Molina, who believes them to be authentically Mercurian and heralds them as a great discovery. Finally, he frames the Rev. Danvers for the trickery in order to also ruin his career, which succeeds flawlessly‚Äîto the extent that Danvers takes his own life. Yet things go awry for Mance when he confesses to Lara that it was he who set up Molina for the fall. However justified it may have been, Lara cannot accept it, nor can she return to Mance/Dante. Crushed, Bracknell turns the focus of his ruined life to consummating his final revenge on the leader of the Yamagata Corporation himself. However, it is in trying to slowly and agonizingly destroy the life of Yamagata, by exposing him to the brutal elements of the planet Mercury for a prolonged period of time, that Mance perhaps finally realizes that revenge has ruined him, and feels regret upon hearing of Danvers' fate. Furthermore, he had caught the wrong Yamagata; it was the son of the billionaire industrialist who'd been culpable in the skytower disaster. In the end, both Yamagata and Bracknell perish in the Mercurian wastes, but the reader is led to believe, through his last will and testament, that Bracknell in his final moments beat his demons and became human again by taping a confession of his schemes while waiting to die. At the same time, Yamagata, who was gladly willing to die if only to protect his son, tapes a message to his son, imploring him to continue his true work in taking humanity to the stars in the near future.

A vapor‚Äìliquid separator is a device used in several industrial applications to separate a vapor‚Äìliquid mixture. A vapor‚Äìliquid separator may also be referred to as a flash drum, breakpot, knock-out drum or knock-out pot, compressor suction drum or compressor inlet drum. When used to remove suspended water droplets from streams of air, it is often called a demister.  Method of operation  For the common variety, gravity is utilized in a vertical vessel to cause the liquid to settle to the bottom of the vessel, where it is withdrawn. In low gravity environments such as a space station, a common liquid separator will not function because gravity is not usable as a separation mechanism. In this case, centrifugal force needs to be utilised in a spinning centrifugal separator to drive liquid towards the outer edge of the chamber for removal. Gaseous components migrate towards the center. For both varieties of separator, the gas outlet may itself be surrounded by a spinning mesh screen or grating, so that any liquid that does approach the outlet strikes the grating, is accelerated, and thrown away from the outlet. The vapor travels through the gas outlet at a design velocity which minimises the entrainment of any liquid droplets in the vapor as it exits the vessel. The feed to a vapor‚Äìliquid separator may also be a liquid that is being partially or totally flashed into a vapor and liquid as it enters the separator.  Liquid level monitoring  The separator is only effective as long as there is a vapor space inside the chamber. The separator can fail if either the mixed inlet is overwhelmed with supply material, or the liquid drain is unable to handle the volume of liquid being collected. The separator may therefore be combined with some other liquid level sensing mechanism such as a sight glass or float sensor. In this manner, both the supply and drain flow can be regulated to prevent the separator from becoming overloaded. (Agastya, Bayu) Where vapor‚Äìliquid separators are used Vapor‚Äìliquid separators are very widely used in a great many industries and applications, such as: *Oil refineries *Natural-gas processing plants (NGL) *Petrochemical and chemical plants *Refrigeration systems *Air conditioning *Compressor systems *Gas pipelines *Steam condensate flash drums *Geothermal power plants *Combined cycle power plants *Flare stacks *Soil vapor extraction *Paper mills  Preventing pump damage  In refrigeration systems, it is common for the system to contain a mixture of liquid and gas, but for the mechanical gas compressor to be intolerant of liquid. Some compressor types such as the scroll compressor use a continuously shrinking compression volume. Once liquid completely fills this volume the pump may either stall and overload, or the pump chamber may be warped or otherwise damaged by the fluid that can not fit into a smaller space.

The metric was published by Istv√°n Ozsv√°th and Engelbert Sch√ºcking in 1962. It is noteworthy among vacuum solutions for being the first known solution that is stationary, globally defined, and singularity-free but nevertheless not isometric to the Minkowski metric. This stands in contradiction to a claimed strong Mach principle, which would forbid a vacuum solution from being anything but Minkowski without singularities, where the singularities are to be construed as mass as in the Schwarzschild metric. With coordinates {x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3}, define the following tetrad: :e_{(0)}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}}\\\\left( x^3\\\\partial_0-\\\\partial_1+\\\\partial_2\\\\right) :e_{(1)}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4+2(x^3)^2}}\\\\left[ \\\\left(x^3-\\\\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\\\\right)\\\\partial_0+\\\\left(1+(x^3)^2-x^3\\\\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\\\\right)\\\\partial_1+\\\\partial_2\\\\right] :e_{(2)}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4+2(x^3)^2}}\\\\left[ \\\\left(x^3+\\\\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\\\\right)\\\\partial_0+\\\\left(1+(x^3)^2+x^3\\\\sqrt{2+(x^3)^2}\\\\right)\\\\partial_1+\\\\partial_2\\\\right] :e_{(3)}=\\\\partial_3 It is straightforward to verify that e(0) is timelike, e(1), e(2), e(3) are spacelike, that they are all orthogonal, and that there are no singularities. The corresponding proper time is :{d \\\\tau}^{2} = -(dx^0)^2 +4(x^3)(dx^0)(dx^2)-2(dx^1)(dx^2)-2(x^3)^2(dx^2)^2-(dx^3)^2. The Riemann tensor has only one algebraically independent, nonzero component :R_{0202}=-1, which shows that the spacetime is Ricci flat but not conformally flat. That is sufficient to conclude that it is a vacuum solution distinct from Minkowski spacetime. Under a suitable coordinate transformation, the metric can be rewritten as : d\\\\tau^2 = [(x^2 - y^2) \\\\cos (2u) + 2xy \\\\sin(2u)] du^2 - 2dudv - dx^2 - dy^2 and is therefore an example of a pp-wave spacetime.

On October 22, 2016, Williams changed his YouTube channel name from DudeLikeHELLA to LiveEachDay, stating that the latter name is a reminder to live in the moment and enjoy every day. He gives tribute to the five years he used the channel's original name and produces a video with the new name. On March 31, 2018, a video on \\"TheMeanKitty\\" channel reported that Loki had died at the age of 10. The video did not mention the cause of death. On June 14, 2020, Williams posted a video on his Youtube channel ‚ÄúTheMeanKitty‚Äù that Sparta could not move from his waist down and can be seen panting. Less than an hour later, Cory took Sparta to the vet and found out he had an underlying heart disease that they did not know about and that he had also suffered a stroke. Sparta died in Cory‚Äôs arms at 9:52am. Television and film In November 2006, Williams became the host of the first national TV show to spawn from video bloggers, called The FIZZ on DirecTV channel 101 in the United States. The show features other popular video bloggers such as TheWineKone, boh3m3, TheHill88. Williams was also named as one of the \\"Who's Who on YouTube\\" by G4TV's Attack of the Show on July 31, 2008, and also made a guest appearance on Tom Green's House Tonight on The Comedy Network in Canada. Williams has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and MTV's Scarred.Appelbaum, Eliav. (2007-09-13) Appelbaum, Eliav \\"'Mean Kitty Song' creator finds fame on Youtube.com \\" The Acorn . Toacorn.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-09. In early October 2007, Williams starred in his first feature film role as the character \\"Hunter\\" in the movie Faded Memories, which opened in theaters on November 14, 2008. The first trailer to the movie was released on YouTube, August 3, 2008. Williams also has a cameo in the music video \\"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\\" by Bloodhound Gang as well as \\"White People For Peace\\" by Against Me!. On September 18, 2008, Williams was featured on The Tyra Show for his music video \\"The Mean Kitty Song.\\" In the episode titled, \\"YouTube Made Me Famous,\\" Tyra Banks announced that Williams makes a monthly income of $20,000 (US). Williams' response to Tyra's comment about his income was, \\"The money I make each month isn't from YouTube alone but through sponsorship, consulting, and acting gigs.\\" On September 17, 2009, Williams was a guest on The Bonnie Hunt Show. This was the first time his cats Sparta and Loki had been taped for television in front of a live studio audience. The topic focused on Cory's ability to comfort animals in extreme situations which led him to perform \\"comfort tricks\\" with Sparta. On October 17, 2014, Williams appeared on Alaskan local station KTVA to talk about his experiences with his move to and life in Alaska, and about his viral video \\"Coolest Sound Ever.\\" It was later announced that Williams would have a weekly slot on their Daybreak morning show, where he would talk about his latest stories and goings on in the state. On October 29, 2014, it was revealed that a variety of production companies had approached Williams, asking to produce a televised reality show based on his life in Alaska and his DudeLikeHELLA video blogging channel. However, he turned all the offers down, stating \\"Why fix what isn‚Äôt broken? We‚Äôre already loving this. This is all we‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs just me, the camera and it‚Äôs us\\". Williams has said though that if an opportunity comes up later on, in which he could explore more of the world, he would be open to the idea of starring in a reality TV show. On January 27, 2017, Williams announced that he would be a participant on the Discovery Channel reality series, Naked and Afraid. He appeared on the August 20th episode \\"Belize Breakdown\\", alongside professional surfer Anastasia Ashley, where he lasted 11 days out of a 14-day goal. An episode of the television show Expecting aired on January 11, 2018, on Up, featured Williams and Kristen Swift, as they chronicled their pregnancy and birth of their child, Chell. Other work Outside of YouTube, Williams worked for a viral video project called, \\"I Got Shotgun\\" (which was created by General Motors) in which he interviewed celebrities on the red carpet about their personal opinions on the future of new media. In the late Spring and Summer of 2012, Cory Williams and Kathleen Elliott (with friend and video man Josh Kanan) went on tour with indie rock musician Shaun Holton (also known as Projected Twin). The tour was a roughly 13,000-mile trip around the continental United States of America that acted as a series of meetups and mini-concerts for fans. Following the conclusion of the tour, the group went to Melbourne, Australia, to do a meet up with another friend and fellow YouTuber . Williams has made all of his newer videos available to view and download in 720p HD on Vimeo, another video-sharing website that obtained high-definition capabilities before YouTube added \\"high quality\\" and \\"HD\\" features. \\"As One\\" Williams is the founder and West Coast American Event Coordinator of the international gathering of YouTube users dubbed \\"As One.\\"Coyle, Jake. \\"YouTube Vloggers Congregate Offline\\", Associated Press, 2007-08-22 The first notable congregations of YouTubers was held this January in Los Angeles and, more famously, in San Francisco in February, where about 100 people attended.

The Swedish health care system is mainly government-funded, universal for all citizens and decentralized, although private health care also exists. The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by county councils and municipalities. A total of 21 councils are in charge with primary and hospital care within the country. Private healthcare is a rarity in Sweden, and even those private institutions work under the mandated city councils. The city councils regulates the rules and the establishment of potential private practices. Although in most countries care for the elderly or those who need psychiatric help is conducted privately, in Sweden local, publicly funded authorities are in charge of this type of care. Management S√∂dersjukhuset is one of the largest hospitals in Sweden. The hospital is owned, funded and operated by Stockholm County Council. Sweden's health care system is organized and managed on three levels: national, regional and local. At the national level, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs establishes principles and guidelines for care and sets the political agenda for health and medical care. The ministry along with other government bodies supervises activities at the lower levels, allocates grants and periodically evaluates services to ensure correspondence to national goals. At the regional level, responsibility for financing and providing health care is decentralized to the 21 county councils. A county council is a political body whose representatives are elected by the public every four years on the same day as the national general election. The executive board or hospital board of a county council exercises authority over hospital structure and management, and ensures efficient health care delivery. County councils also regulate prices and level of service offered by private providers. Private providers are required to enter into a contract with the county councils. Patients are not reimbursed for services from private providers who do not have an agreement with the county councils. According to the Swedish health and medical care policy, every county council must provide residents with good-quality health services and medical care and work toward promoting good health in the entire population. At the local level, municipalities are responsible for maintaining the immediate environment of citizens such as water supply and social welfare services. Recently, post discharge care for the disabled and elderly, and long-term care for psychiatric patients was decentralized to the local municipalities. County councils have considerable leeway in deciding how care should be planned and delivered. This explains the wide regional variations. It is informally divided into 7 sections: \\"Close-to-home care\\" (primary care clinics, maternity care clinics, out-patient psychiatric clinics, etc.), emergency care, elective care, in-patient care, out-patient care, specialist care, and dental care. All citizens are to be given on line access to their own electronic health records by 2020. Many different record systems are used which has caused problems for interoperability. A national patient portal, ‚Äò1177.se‚Äô is used by all systems, with both telephone and online access. At June 2017 about 41% of the population had set up their own account to use personal e-services using this system. A national Health Information Exchange platform provides a single point of connectivity to the many different systems. There is not yet a national regulatory framework for patients‚Äô direct access to their health information. Provision Private companies in 2015 provide about 20% of public hospital care and about 30% of public primary care, although in 2014 a survey by the SOM Institute found that 69% of Swedes were opposed to private companies profiting from providing public education, health, and social care, with only about 15% actively in favour. In April 2015 V√§sternorrland County ordered its officials to find ways to limit the profits private companies can reap from running publicly funded health services. Financing Costs for health and medical care amounted to approximately 9 percent of Sweden's gross domestic product in 2005, a figure that remained fairly stable since the early 1980s. By 2015 the cost had risen to 11.9% of GDP -the highest in Europe. Seventy-one percent of health care is funded through local taxation, and county councils have the right to collect income tax. The state finances the bulk of health care costs, with the patient paying a small nominal fee for examination. The state pays for approximately 97% of medical costs.Glenngard, A., Hjalte, F., Svennson, M., Anell, A., & Bankauskaite, V. (2005). Health Systems in Transition: Sweden. WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2005 When a physician declares a patient to be ill for whatever reason (by signing a certificate of illness/unfitness), the patient is paid a percentage of their normal daily wage from the second day. For the first 14 days, the employer is required to pay this wage, and after that the state pays the wage until the patient is declared fit. The funding and cost of keeps healthcare affordable and accessible to all Swedish citizens. Local taxes equate for about 70% of the budgets for councils and municipalities, while overall 85% of the total health budget come from public funding. Details and patient costs Prescription drugs are not free but fees to the user are capped at 2350 SEK per annum. Once a patient's prescriptions reach this amount, the government covers any further expenses for the rest of the year. The funding system is automated. The country's pharmacies are connected over the Internet. Each prescription is sent to the pharmacy network, which stores information on a patient's medical history and on the prescriptions fulfilled previously for that patient. If the patient's pharmaceutical expenses have exceeded the annual limit, the patient receives the medication free of charge at the point of sale, upon producing identification. In a sample of 13 developed countries Sweden was eleventh in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in 2009 and twelfth in 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use. A limit on health-care fees per year exists; 150-400 SEK for each visit to a doctor, regardless if they are a private doctor or work at a local health-care center or a hospital. When visiting a hospital, the entrance fee covers all specialist visits the doctor deems necessary, like x-ray, rheumatism specialist, heart surgery operations and so on. The same fee is levied for ambulance services. After 1150 SEK have been paid, health-care for the rest of the year will be provided free of charge. Dental care is not included in the general health care system, but is partly subsidized by the government. Dental care is free for citizens up to 23 years of age. Mental health care is an integrated part of the health care system and is subject to the same legislation and user fees as other health care services. If an individual has minor mental health issues, he is attended to by a GP in a primary health setting; if the patient has major mental health issues he is referred to specialized psychiatric care in hospitals. Performance The reduction in infant mortality between 1960 and 2008 for Sweden in comparison with Ireland, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. According to the Euro health consumer index the Swedish score for technically excellent healthcare services, which they rated 10th in Europe in 2015, is dragged down by access and waiting time problems, in spite of national efforts such as V√•rdgaranti. It is claimed that there is a long tradition of steering patients away from their doctor unless they are really sick. A shortage of medical personnel is a major problem.  Waiting times  Urgent cases are always prioritized and emergency cases are treated immediately. The national guarantee of care, V√•rdgaranti, lays down standards for waiting times for scheduled care, aiming to keep waiting time below 7 days for a visit to a primary care physician, and no more than 90 days for a visit to a specialist. Private healthcare According to Nima Sanandaji, at the end of 2017, 643,000 individuals in Sweden were fully covered by private health insurance, which is 6.5% of the population of Sweden. This is an increase of over half a million fully covered by private health insurance compared to 2000.So Long, Swedish Welfare State?  Criticisms  The Swedish health system is mainly effective but there are some problems within the system. Increased access to primary care is one issue that arises. Most citizens in Sweden go to the hospital for routine check ups. Primary care needs to be made more readily accessible to Swedes instead of them going to hospitals for minor health needs. Another issue is Swedish emergency units are below the minimum safe size. The decentralized healthcare system in Sweden leads to this inefficiency, because of decentralization the counties are granted an extreme amount of flexibility. The coordination between counties and municipalities is affected because of this constant shifting and flexibility. In recent years the health care system of Sweden has been heavily criticized for not providing the same quality of health care to all Swedish citizens. The disparity of health care quality in Sweden is growing. Swedish citizens of other ethnicities than Swedish, and citizens who are of a lower socio-economic class receive a significantly lower quality of health care than the rest of the population. This was especially brought to light during the COVID-19 pandemic as Swedish media and public health researchers pointed out that Swedish citizens of other ethnicities than Swedish and people living in working class areas were dying from COVID-19 at a significantly higher rate than the rest of the population, due to the fact that they were not provided with the same quality of health care as the rest of the population.

It is a colorless liquid and has a slight peppermint- or camphor- odor. It is a precursor to triazolylpinacolone in the synthesis of the fungicide triadimefon and in synthesis of the herbicide metribuzin. The molecule is an unsymmetrical ketone. The Œ±-methyl group can participate in condensation reactions. The carbonyl group can undergo the usual reactions (hydrogenation, reductive amination, etc.). It is a Schedule 3 compound under the Chemical Weapons Convention 1993, due to being related to pinacolyl alcohol, which is used in the production of soman. It is also a controlled export in Australia Group member states. Preparation Most famously, at least in the classroom, pinacolone arises by the pinacol rearrangement, which occurs by protonation of pinacol (2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol). :580px Industrially pinacolone is made by the hydrolysis of 4,4,5-trimethyl-1,3-dioxane, which is the product of isoprene and formaldehyde via the Prins reaction. It also is generated by ketonization of pivalic acid and acetic acid or acetone over metal oxide catalysts. 3-Methylbutanal is a starting material for 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, which in turn is converted to pinacolone. Pinacolone can also be produced from 2-methy-2-butanol when reacted with C5 alcohols. Drug Uses Pinacolone is produced in large amounts for use in fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides. #retrosynthetic analysis of vibunazole showed that it was derived from pinacolone. #It is also used to prepare pinacidil, as well as naminidil. #Stiripentol #Tribuzone #Pivaloylacetonitrile is used in the synthesis of Doramapimod. #Triadimefon #Diclobutrazole #Paclobutrazol #Valconazole # Diethylstilbestrol pinacolone [18922-13-9]. #Some kind of Bisphenol A derivative also See also *Pinacol *Pinacolyl alcohol *Soman References Category:Alkanones Category:Tert- butyl compounds Category:Nerve agent precursors ","title":"Pinacolone"},{"id":"13320559","text":"Netarde is a small village in sawantwadi taluka (Dist.

The main church of the town boasts a sculpture of crucified Jesus and picture of St. Maria, which was brought to this town in middle of 17th century from Rome. The picture is considered to be saintly.  History of the name  This place was mentioned in 1253 as Garde (Garda√≠). In the 17th century, when the main church and road of cross was built, people started calling it the New Jerusalem, but after some time it was named Kalvarija after the name of the hill where Jesus was crucified. In the 20th century, the town was renamed to ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Kalvarija to avoid misunderstandings, because there is another town in south-west of Lithuania called Kalvarija. During the Soviet years, 1964‚Äì1989, the town was renamed to Varduva after Varduva river that flows near the town. At that time, people, who visited this place as pilgrims were persecuted by KGB.

It is the largest tributary of the Kuzitrin River. It begins near Imuruk Lake on the Seward Peninsula and flows generally north to Kugruk Lagoon, at Kotzebue Sound on the Chukchi Sea. The river enters the lagoon southeast of Cape Deceit in the Northwest Arctic Borough. History In the late 19th century, the river's Inuit name was reported as \\"Koogroog\\" (not to be confused with the Kougarok River), but variants in other documents referred to it as \\"Mammoth\\" for mammoth bones found nearby, or \\"Swan\\". In 1904, the United States Board on Geographic Names approved the name \\"Kugruk\\", which is how the river was identified in court records. Some mining was reported on Windy, Neva, North Fork, Coarse Gold, Henry, Taylor, and Macklin creeks, tributaries of the Kugruk River. Geography The Kugruk River is a large northern tributary of the Kuzitrin. It has a length, neglecting meanders and minor bends, of about . Throughout the greater part of its course, it occupies a canyon cut in a high plateau-like upland, which varies in elevation from . About above its mouth, the Kugruk River emerges upon the Kuzitrin lowland from its canyon. The course of this canyon is approximately north and south for , and follows in a general way the strike of the bed rock. Below the mouth of Coarse Gold Creek the canyon is sharply cut, and no gravel benches or extensive gravel bars were observed in the creek bed. Above Coarse Cold Creek the valley broadens. At this place there are broad benches, about above the river bed. cut on the upturned edges of the schists, and covered with several feet of gravel. Similar gravel benches occur occasionally as far as the mouth of Taylor Creek, above which point the creek bed was not examined in detail. At the mouth of Macklin Creek, the Kugruk River turns sharply, and above this place it flows in an east‚Äìwest direction from its source at the east base of Kugruk Mountain. The bed rock along the Kugruk River is generally highly metamorphosed, consisting of mica-schists and calcareous schists, with large intrusions of greenstone. The greenstone is schistose, but has a porphyritic texture, the phenocrysts being hornblende, while the groundmass is made up essentially of epidote, hornblende, quartz, and chlorite, mostly secondary minerals. Tributaries Windy Creek is a large tributary of the Kugruk River from the west. Its source is near that of Igloo Creek, which is tributary to the Agiapuk River. Windy Creek flows across the strike of the bed rock in a deep canyon, cut in the Kugruk Plateau. The gravels seen at the mouth of this creek consist of greenstone, limestone, and mica-schist. The bed rock along the creek is reported to be a series of limestones and mica-schists. Neva Creek is a short tributary of the Kugruk River from the east side, about one- fourth of a mile above the mouth of Windy Creek. The bed rock at its mouth is gray mica-schist, highly metamorphosed. Sluicing was done in shallow gravels near the mouth of the creek during the summer. At the time of the writer's visit the camp was deserted, although the sluice boxes and canvas hose were still in position. North Fork is a large tributary of the Kugruk River from the east, about above Windy Creek. Harris Creek flows into North Fork about from its mouth. Coarse Gold Creek is a large tributary of the Kugruk River from the west side, about a mile above North Fork. It heads in the high divide between the Kugruk and Agiapuk drainages, and flows eastward, cutting across the strike of the schists and limestones. At the mouth of the creek the bed rock consists of highly altered mica-schists. Henry Creek is tributary to the Kugruk River from the west. It heads in the high divide south of Kugruk Mountain, and flows eastward in a deep canyon cut in the upland and across the strike of the schist and limestone bed rock. The Kugruk River forks about from its mouth, the branches being of about equal size. The eastern fork is called Taylor Creek, while the western retains the name Kugruk River. Taylor Creek rises to the southeast of Midnight Mountain, and flows west to its junction with the Kugruk River. It occupies a valley about deep, cut in the plateau on which Midnight Mountain stands. The bed rock at the mouth of Taylor Creek is a dark schist similar to that of Midnight Mountain, while immediately south of that mountain, at a point about f> miles from the mouth of Taylor Creek, there are exposures of very much altered limestone. The creek probably cuts across the strike of a series of beds of schist and limestone. Macklin Creek is a tributary of the Kugruk River from the east side, about above the mouth of Taylor Creek. It heads near the base of Midnight Mountain and flows westward about to its junction with the Kugruk River. For several miles Macklin Creek flows parallel to Schlitz Creek, tributary to the Serpentine River, and a low pass between the two creeks suggests an old waterway. The creek occupies a rather broad valley cut in the upland. The bed rock, where it has been seen, consists of dark feldspathic, graphitic mica-schist, similar to that of Midnight Mountain.

The Ramos house, considered one of the most prominent of these houses, is the house built by the Ramos family patriarch Don Mariano Ramos, the first Municipal President or Mayor of Bacolod City. In 1935, he commissioned a certain Architect Mendoza of Manila to design and build a house for him in the Castilian and Tuscan style. The most prominent feature of the house is the three-storey octagonal tower that gave the owners a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding landscape. At the rear portion of the house is a rounded balcony adjacent to the master bedroom. Don Mariano Ramos loved to entertain. Many elegant parties were held here attended by the cr√®me de la cr√®me () of Bacolod society and visited by both local and national government officials. One such guest was Mariano's close friend and classmate, Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon. Legendary in those days were his twenty or more cars of different makes chauffeured by Spanish mestizo and Filipino drivers.

He was also a talented rugby union player who represented England in two tests. Life Campbell was born on 16 July 1915 at Ellerslie Station, near Adelong, New South Wales. He was the third child of Australian-born parents Alfred Campbell, a grazier and medical practitioner, and his wife Edith Madge, n√©e Watt.Kramer (2006) In 1930, Campbell went to The King's School, Parramatta, and in 1935, with the support of the headmaster, he enrolled at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1937. His studies in English literature developed his interest in poetry. At Cambridge, he excelled at rugby union and as well as earning a Blue after playing in The Varsity Match, he was chosen for England. Playing at flanker he made his debut in the test match against Wales at Twickenham in 1937. He played a second test that year against Ireland. Campbell returned to Australia from Cambridge in 1938 and on 6 November 1939 joined the Royal Australian Air Force. He had learned to fly while at Cambridge and went to train as a pilot at Point Cook. He served in New Guinea, where he was injured and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and flew bombing missions from Darwin in the Northern Territory. Campbell married Bonnie Edith Lawrence on 20 January 1940 at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak, Melbourne. They had two sons (including John) and a daughter, but were divorced in 1973. In 1946, he settled on a family property, Wells Station, near Canberra, and in 1961 he moved to Palerang, near Bungendore, New South Wales. In 1968, he moved again to The Run, Queanbeyan, New South Wales. On 18 February 1974 Campbell married Judith Anne Jones in Sydney. From May to September 1975 they travelled in England and Europe, his first trip abroad since his Cambridge days. He had many literary friends. These included, in addition to poet and editor, Douglas Stewart, historian Manning Clark, poet Rosemary Dobson, writer Patrick White, and poet and academic A. D. Hope. He was interested in painting, golf and polo, and was a keen fisherman, an activity he often shared with Douglas Stewart. Manning Clark has written about aspects of his friendship with David Campbell. Campbell, wrote Clark \\"was an enlarger of life, not a straitener or measurer, or a life-denier\\" the key to him being found in \\"the two books he re-read each year: The Idiot by Dostoevsky, and The Aunt's Story by Patrick White.CMH Clark. The Quest For Grace. Penguin Books Ringwood 1990, p 216. \\"He was the war hero, the victor in the boxing ring, the strong man in the rugby scrum, the fisherman, the horseman, the polo player who knew all about Myshkin [character from The Idiot] and Theodora Goodman [character from The Aunt's Story]. I saw him knock out a man in the bar at Delegate for casting doubts on his manhood. The next morning I saw him cast a fly with such delicacy that it landed on the waters of the Snowy River with the grace of a butterfly.\\" David Campbell died of cancer on 29 July 1979, at the Royal Canberra Hospital. Literary career While Campbell had a few poems published in Cambridge journals between 1935 and 1937, his poetry didn't start appearing regularly in print until 1942 when he started sending poems to The Bulletin. Six were published by 1944. It was in these years that he first became known to Douglas Stewart, with whom he formed a long-standing friendship. These early poems dealt primarily with war, but from 1946, after his move to Wells Station, \\"his poetry became more closely attuned to the realities of the countryside\\". Kramer writes that \\"his daily life as a grazier, his acute observations of the natural world and his deep understanding of European poetry gave him a distinctive poetic voice, learned but not didactic, harmonious but not bland, vigorous but finely tuned\\". The following are representative examples of his use of European and Asian (haiku) poetic forms to capture the contemplative experience of the Monaro plains. \\"For now the sharp leaves On the tree are still And the great blond paddocks Come down from the hill.\\"David Campbell.

The park is located in an area which incorporates what was once Campbell's property at Wells Station. The original paddock boundary is marked by a line of remnant eucalypt trees and the original fence by ceramic tiles inlaid with barbed wire.Jon Stanhope (November 2007) The name of the park comes from the book of poems, The Miracle of Mullion Hill, which Campbell wrote when he lived at Wells Station with his family. It was published in 1956. The park honours Campbell, \\"not for his work as a grazier, nor for his dedication to the Royal Australian Air Force, in which he served and was wounded as a pilot in World War II, but for his lyrical poetry about love, war and the Australian rural life\\".Florez (2007) At the opening of the park, Chief Minister of the ACT, Jon Stanhope, said that Campbell is \\"often called the poet of the Monaro\\" and that his poetry \\"reflects the local landscape and was greatly influenced by his life as a farmer of the surrounding countryside\\". The park incorporates excerpts from his poems, embedded in wooden pedestals and on pathways. It is intended to connect residents of Wells Station to the heritage of the region and provide a cultural as well as a recreational retreat.

The river rises in the Bendeleben Mountains and flows south to Golovnin Lagoon, before emptying into Golovnin Bay, Norton Sound, and the Bering Sea. The basin formed by the Fish River is known for its placer gold deposits, and in particular, the Niukluk River and its tributaries; production from this tributary valley is reported to be more than from any other place in the region. A galena mine existed from the sea, worked on occasion by a San Francisco corporation with a few hundred tons of ore taken to the city for smelting and refining for silver. Walter Curran Mendenhall found obscure fossils on Fish River at White Mountain. Etymology Its Inuit name was reported in 1838 as Ikalikhvik meaning \\"fish (or fish place)\\" by Aleksandr Filippovich Kashevarov. Various spellings were reported by Western Union Telegraph Expedition in 1865‚Äì67. Dall appears to be the first to have applied the name \\"Fish River\\" in 1870 when he wrote: \\"Golofnina Bay is connected with a large lagoon which opens in Grantley Harbor by the extremely winding channel of the Fish River, which has one principal tributary, the Kavi-ava-zak.\\" Dall's application heads the Fish River on what is now the Niukluk River. Geography Fish River is one of the streams emanating from the northern part of the Bendeleben Mountains, along with others such as Tubutulik River. The area is accessible from Nome via a small airstrip at White Mountain. The catchment area of the river is about . It is bounded by Golovnin Sound to its south, by the Kruzgamepa River to its west and the mountain range to its north (starting with Cape Darby in an arc from). It has many tributaries that rise at low elevations, and most of them are of equal length and have almost equal flow rates. The northwest of the river basin is bounded by the hills, which rise to a height of about . Two stream originate from here, flow in torrents for some initial reach in the hills and then enters into flatter terrain where the river meanders forming sandbars. All the streams join together in the gorge section itself before entering flatter terrain. It is met by the Niukluk River, and then flows for considerable distance in loops and forms the headwaters of the delta of Golovnin Sound. The delta extends over a width of and touches the foot of the White Mountain, a low mountain of about in height dominated by limestone formations. The delta is bisected by two channels, interspersed with sloughs, marshes, and ponds. Both channels are navigable; the west channel is larger and suitable for river craft and small boats to ply and the east channel is also navigable and suitable for plying light river craft. Geology Granite formations are recorded in the head reaches of the river with schistose sediment intrusions. Bluffs of slates are also noted in certain stretches of the river valley. White coarse crystalline marble was reported in the area marked by two branches of the fish river, which are noted between intrusions of granites. The gorge section of the river has schist and limestone geological formations. In the Nome group of Seaward Peninsula, geological formations of schist and limestone have also been recorded. Their age is conjectured as of Cambrian to Post Ordovician. The magnesium limestone formation in the White Mountain of the Fish River Basin is reported to contain fossil fauna in the form of a \\"heavy-shelled lamilibranch\\". This fossil has been compared with similar finds in south eastern Alaska in the limestone formations of similar age in the Glacier Bay and Freshwater Bay. Wildlife Fish River is also known for its rich stock of fishing resources which attracted establishing of a number of fishing camps. The fish species reported from the river are: Chum salmon, silver salmon, red salmon, burbot, Northern pike, Dolly Varden, Arctic grayling, and whitefish. Bald eagles are reported to nest at the confluence of this river with Niukluk River. Mining In the Fish River valley, its longest tributary, Niukluk, has produced more gold than the rest of the region. This region was named the Council district. The river was reported initially to carry gold from its mouth to the northern periphery of the gorge. In the lower stretch of river water color was very light but got concentrated and heavier towards the constricted part of the valley. Here, limestone and schists belts are recorded as crossing the stream. The deposits are noted from the mouth of the river extending into the gorge section in the north. However, no gold was found in the upper lava plateau region of the river. The northern and eastern parts of the basin have the geological formations of schists (with biotite) and limestones similar to the type found in the Placer region. In the Council district area, placer gold was explored and in 1898 mining was organized in the distrait and the production was substantial and placed second to that produced at Nome. Silver found in the upper regions of the Fish River was extracted at the Omalik Mine. Apart from silver a small amount of lead found was also extracted at this mine as early as 1881.

A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, she has represented the riding of Vancouver Quadra in the House of Commons since 2008. She was re-elected in the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd federal elections; Murray was appointed President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government on March 18, 2019. She was re-appointed as Minister of Digital Government following the 2019 election. Murray previously served as a cabinet minister in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, first as Minister of Water, Land, and Air Protection from 2001 to 2004 and then as Minister of Management Services until 2005. From 2003 to 2004, she presided over the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. On April 14, 2013, Murray placed second in the Liberal Party of Canada leadership election. In August 2013, Murray became the Opposition critic for both National Defence and Western Diversification. In December 2015, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board. Background Murray was born in Schweizer-Reneke, South Africa, and immigrated to Canada with her parents in 1961. They settled in Vancouver, in the Point Grey area, where she lives now. Murray's mother, Charlotte Coe Murray was the first female assistant professor at the University of British Columbia School of Architecture. In 1968, Murray's father, Gordon Murray, founded Murray & Associates Surveying. After graduating from Lord Byng Secondary School in West Point Grey, Murray attended Simon Fraser University in the 1970s, studied archaeology and linguistics, and then completed pre-med. In 1989 she pursued an executive master's degree in Business Administration and in 1992 she received the Faculty of Business' \\"Dean's Convocation Medal\\" as the top MBA graduate.\\"City woman branches out into business\\" p12 Royal City Record, June 8, 1993 Her thesis was a policy analysis of one of Canada's options for meeting the challenge of climate change.Joyce C. Murray: Global Warming: Policy Analysis and Proposal for a Carbon Sink Silviculture Program (1992).https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Warming.html?id=sRusPgAACAAJ&hl;=en Joyce Murray's thesis In 1977, Murray married Dirk Brinkman, with whom she co-founded a group of reforestation companies and raised three children: a daughter and two sons, including Baba Brinkman. Business career Murray and a group of friends won one of the first tree-planting contracts in British Columbia in 1970, starting what would become Brinkman and Associates Reforestation. Starting as a small tree-planting proprietorship in British Columbia, the business began to expand when Joyce and Dirk started working together in 1975. In 1979, Murray incorporated Brinkman and Associates Reforestation Ltd. with her husband Dirk Brinkman. Since then, the company has grown and diversified its operations, and planted their billionth tree in 2012. In 1976, Nick Kendall of Orca Productions documented the planting millions of trees in the heavy slash debris of that era's logging in a one- hour NFB documentary Do it with Joy. Released in 1977, it is regarded as a tree-planting classic today.Review Adam Humphreys 2009 http://freemarketsolutions.blogspot.ca/2009/08/do-it-with-joy.html In 1979, the CBC made Do it with Joy into a half-hour documentary.Filmography, Nicholas Kendall http://www.orcaproductions.com/nkendall.htm Murray and Brinkman grew the company across Canada (1978 Alberta; 1983 Ontario, 1987 Saskatchewan 1989 Quebec, 1992 Manitoba, 1993 Yukon) and diversified beyond reforestation into ecosystem restoration, urban restoration, forest management services for First Nation communities, rights of way clearing and fully integrated harvest to reforestation services and sustainability initiatives. In 1994, the company's long-term strategic international division, BARCA, was formed to develop forestry initiatives and plantations in Central America.2006 In 2007, Brinkman co-founded the Earth Partners LP which is undertaking the largest private soil and ecosystem restoration projects in the United States. The company operates in six countries and is developing projects in several others. It employs approximately 600 full-time and 800 seasonal positions. Joyce was integral to developing management systems, organizational re- engineering, strategic development, restructuring, training and business planning and for a period beginning 1979 she was the chair of the board of directors and from this role proposed a global warming strategy for Canada based on her thesis.The Kootenay Review, Vol 2, #2, January 1988 Provincial politics From 1996 to 1999, Murray sat on the BC Forest Resources Advisory Board and the GVRD Waste Management Committee.http://brinkmanforest.ca/articles/frbc-policies-murray.php As a result of her public interventions, the leader of the BC Liberals attempted to persuade her to run for nomination as a BC Liberal candidate, but she challenged him to lead more strongly on sustainability commitments.http://brinkmanforest.ca/articles/wsca-proposals-murray.php When she declared herself a candidate in May 2000, the headline \\"From the Greens to the Liberals\\" ran over an article that opens with predictions Murray had made in 1997 about forest renewal, her background and wish \\"to create a sustainable community\\".Lori Pappajohn, Special Report, Royal City Record, May 2000 In August 2000, Murray won the nomination as the BC Liberal candidate for the riding of electoral district of New Westminster. During the election, she developed climate action and forest renewal policy papers for the party leadership. Then in 2001, she switched from business to politics full-time when she became the first BC Liberal to be elected from New Westminster in 49 years. She was named a cabinet minister by Premier Gordon Campbell in June 2001, serving until 2004 as the first-ever minister of Water, Land and Air Protection, and as Minister of Management Services from 2004 until the 2005 election. In 2002, Murray hosted a joint meeting of the federal, provincial and territorial energy and environment ministers, to examine policies in the context of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.Ministry of Water Land and Air Protection Annual Report 2001-2002 http://www.bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/Annual_Reports/2001_2002/wlap.pdf Her tenure as Minister of Water, Land and Air Protection focused on protecting ecological sites in the province. For example, Murray worked towards developing an agreement with the Heiltsuk First Nation and brought about co-management of the protected Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy Area.4th Session, 37th Parliament, Hansard Vol 18 No 10 Page 8058 November 19, 2003 Spruce Lake Protected Area was named a provincial park, and Burns Bog, the largest domed peat bog on the west coast, was purchased by the province and other local public entities and became the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area. She also presided over budget cuts in the department and rollbacks of environmental regulations. \\"Murray lifted the moratorium on hunting grizzly bears, oversaw huge cutbacks in staffing levels for environmental protection, and gutted the Waste Management Act in favour of legislation that eliminated up to 80 percent of permitting.\\" The chair of the Sierra Club's BC chapter stated in 2003: \\"I have never seen such an assault on the environment\\". However, the Sierra Club later awarded Murray with a medal for her environmental work. Murray also introduced the first comprehensive framework strategy for total product stewardship for recycling of all products in British Columbia.Status discussed 2003 Legislative Session: 4th Session, 37th Parliament Hansard -- Thursday, May 15, 2003 pm -- Vol. 15, No. 14 The new regulations required that producers assume responsibility for removing their products from the waste stream. She also brought together the province's 13 oil producers to develop a cooperative solution for recycling waste oil, plastic (from containers), and steel wool from oil filters. At that time, over 22million litres of oil was entering the GVRD waste stream annually. Murray then brought the electronics industry under the product stewardship framework to develop solutions for all electronics waste, and worked with the pulp and paper industry to help them implement their stewardship strategy. Murray's work has since served as the basis for similar legislation in several other provinces. From 2003 to 2004, Murray was the president of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. As Minister of Management Services in 2004, Murray participated in the moves to the first ever cross-Canada interprovincial procurement program and the first legislation that would limit personal information access via foreign corporations working in Canada.HANSARD WEDNESDAY, April 21, 2004 ESTIMATES: MINISTRY OF MANAGEMENT SERVICES http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/37th5th/h40421p.htm#10329 HANSARD TUESDAY October 19, 2004 BILL 73_2004 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY AMENDMENT ACT, 2004 https://www.leg.bc.ca/37th5th/3rd_read/gov73-3.htm She was defeated by Chuck Puchmayr in the 2005 provincial election before moving on to federal politics. Federal politics Point Grey Fiesta Day in Vancouver Quadra June 19, 2010 In the 2006 federal election, Murray was the Liberal Party candidate in the riding of New Westminster‚ÄîCoquitlam, placing third behind New Democrat Dawn Black and Conservative incumbent Paul Forseth. But in 2007, she became the Liberal candidate in her home riding of Vancouver Quadra, as Stephen Owen, the incumbent Liberal MP in the riding, had resigned in July 2007. In a March 2008 by-election, Murray defeated her main competitor, Conservative candidate Deborah Meredith. Murray was re-elected in 2008 and 2011. Murray was the third-party critic for Small Business and Tourism, the Asia Pacific Gateway, and Western Economic Diversification for the Liberal Party's shadow cabinet, having previously served as the Liberal critic for Amateur Sport, leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and as the critic for Democratic Reform in 2008. During her first term in the House of Commons she sat on the House's Standing Committee on International Trade and was vice-chair of the Liberal Caucus Committee on Environmental Sustainability. Murray also visited Colombia and Panama to review proposed free trade agreements. She attended the climate negotiations at the Bali Conference in 2007 and the Copenhagen Summit in 2009.http://www.bloggingcanadians.ca/ConservativeBlogs/Joyce_Murray_is_Stephane_Dions_sort_of_environmentalist/ After the latter, Murray wrote, while applauding positive actions on Canada's municipal governments, \\"a patchwork of climate initiatives is far from effective ‚Äì a coordinated approach across this vast and diverse country is required\\".Murray, Joyce, Copenhagen, Climate Change & Canada After her first term, Murray's committee experience included membership on the Standing Committees on Environmental and Sustainable Development, Fisheries and Oceans, and serving as vice-chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Health. She was also an active member of the Canada-China Legislative Association, chaired Parliament's All-Party Conservation Caucus, and was the vice-chair of the Liberal Policy Caucus. In March 2012, Murray visited Haiti as a member of a delegation representing the Canadian section of ParlAmericas. In June 2008, she presented her first private member's bill, Bill C-572, which proposed exempting bicycles (including electric bikes), bike accessories, repairs, and safety training from the GST. In June 2014, Murray introduced Bill C-622, the CSEC Accountability and Transparency Act. This legislation would have updated the framework for accountability and transparency for CSEC, partially in response to concerns over the use of metadata. It also would have established a committee of security-cleared parliamentarians, to oversee all of Canada's security and intelligence agencies. The next Liberal government would later introduce many of these provisions, including a new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, with Bill C-22 and Bill C-59. In December 2010, Murray introduced Bill C-606, An Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act, which proposed to ban oil tanker traffic on Canada's Pacific North Coast. The bill passed first reading in the House of Commons and was scheduled for second reading when an election was called in March 2011. In the next session, she reintroduced the bill as Bill C-437. In 2017, the Liberal government introduced a similar law, Bill C-48. Murray is opposed to all pipelines that would ship Alberta oil and bitumen to the British Columbia coast, calling them a \\"stone age\\" approach to energy development. Murray has called for more oil to be refined and upgraded in Canada and for an end to \\"oilsands industry subsidies, and opposition to pipeline proposals to carry bitumen to a BC port\\".Yaffe, Barbara, op. cit December 10, 2012 In June 2012, Murray hosted Adam Scorgie and Brett Harvey in Ottawa to screen their documentary The Union: The Business Behind Getting High for parliamentarians. Supporting the legalization of marijuana would be part of Murray's leadership election platform later that year. Leadership Murray during a candidates debate on February 16, 2013, in Mississauga Murray confirmed in September 2012 that she was exploring the idea of running for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. On November 26, 2012, she announced that she was entering the leadership race, as the only candidate based in western Canada,although former Toronto MP Martha Hall Findlay's campaign was being run from Calgary. Murray described her leadership platform to a \\"capacity crowd\\" in her riding on December 1. Murray announced that she supported appointing a minimum of 40 percent women to cabinet and to government boards, commissions, and agencies. She also supported putting a price on carbon, legalizing marijuana, and wanted Liberals to work cooperatively with the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Green Party in the next federal election if this is the desire of riding associations. Murray was the only candidate in the leadership race who supported cooperating with other parties before the election. More than half of Liberals (53%), NDP supporters (55%) and Green Party supporters (57%) polled February 6, 2013, were supportive of running a single candidate against the Conservatives in each riding.http://www.joycemurray.ca/newspages/166-cooperationpoll The NDP was officially opposed to the idea, although their house leader, Nathan Cullen, had suggested the concept before when he gained support from Greens, according to Green Party leader Elizabeth May. May praised Murray \\"for charting a difficult course, displaying political courage and integrity\\". On February 15, the eve of the third debate, Murray's position had come to the attention of online groups seeking electoral co-operation. Murray was also the only Liberal leadership candidate to speak out strongly in favour of electing the House of Commons with a system of proportional representation. She challenged Trudeau on the issue, especially over his assertion that voters wanted proportional representation because they did not understand the consequences of adopting it. David Suzuki endorsed Murray's Climate Change position on February 15. On March 13, Marc Garneau, who was considered to be in second place, dropped out of the leadership race. An internal poll released by Garneau showed that Murray was in third place behind Justin Trudeau and Garneau, with 7.4% support among potential voters, and she had taken the role of \\"challenger\\". It was later admitted that the poll did not comply with federal caller identification rules. On March 23, Elizabeth May announced the Green party would not run a candidate in the Labrador by-election and Murray announced that cooperation on the matter had been discussed with May.http://joycemurray.ca/newspages/262-release-labrador-by-election The topic was discussed in the 5th debate. The NDP nominated a candidate although May asked them not to. On March 26, Murray claimed to have the greatest number of registered supporters. Similar numbers of supporters and members of the party may have registered to vote. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Murray raised $56,554.06 in campaign donations. Out of the seven candidates who were registered at this time, she placed fifth in the amount of donations raised. A March 2013 report showed Murray in third place having raised $169,000. A later March report put Murray in second place having raised $198,000. With each of the 308 ridings across the country assigned equal weight, Murray finished in second place with 10.16% points ahead of Martha Hall Findlay's 5.71% and behind winner Justin Trudeau's 80.09% points. Trudeau had lost only 5 ridings, all to Murray and all in BC. Federal politics after the leadership race Murray was appointed the Liberal critic for both National Defence and Western Diversification and became chair of the Party's Northern and Western Caucus. Murray spoke out on matters from defence procurement and safety to electoral reform. In her defence role, Murray co-authored a published opinion \\"Who's watching our spies?\\" when a security scandal arose after Parliament was prorogued on September 16, 2013. Prorogation does not require private members' bills to be reintroduced, hence Murray's bill, C-437, from the first session of the 41st Canadian Parliament, remained in place as the second session opened October 16, 2013. Before the opening, Liberal Party expenses, including Murray's, had been posted. In 2013, Murray published two articles on national defence, \\"Canada's Navy is a Sinking Ship\\" and \\"My Wish List for National Defence in 2014\\", published November 27 and December 20 respectively. The first draws from the comments made in the Auditor General's report covering the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy.PWGSC NSPS On March 2, 2014, Joyce Murray was introduced to Vancouver Quadra supporters as their acclaimed candidate and the first Liberal to be selected in British Columbia to run in the 42nd Canadian federal election tentatively scheduled for October 19, 2015. On June 18, 2014, Murray tabled for first reading, Private Member's Bill C-622, \\"An Act to amend the National Defence Act (transparency and accountability), to enact the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts\\". Murray noted during second reading October 30, 2014 that \\"the prior commissioners of CSEC and prior chiefs of CSEC or CSE have called for this very committee themselves\\". On November 5 after further discussion, with members aware that Australia, New Zealand, the U.S and the U.K. had civilian security oversight committees, Bill C-622 was defeated by 142 votes to 120.41st Parliament, 2nd Session, Hansard, November 5, 2014 http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Doc=139&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=41&Pub;=Hansard&Ses;=2 On December 12, 2014, it was reported that ministers had written that Foreign Affairs and Defence representatives would provide an update on Canada's mission in Iraq to an existing committee in response to a letter from Murray and Marc Garneau. On April 14, 2015, an opinion piece by Murray published on the response to an oil spill in English Bay. The next month, on May 5, Murray represented the Liberal Party in the House of Commons in favour of Bill C-51. While she suggested there was some positive feedback, the evidence showed that the majority of Canadians opposed this bill. On September 16 of that year, GreenPAC, an NGO dedicated to action to protect the environment, announced that an expert panel had placed Murray amongst the eighteen greenest candidates in the 2015 election. Joyce Murray and MPs Hedy Fry and Jonathan Wilkinson at the Kitsilano Coast Guard Station Reopening On September 18, 2015, Craig Forcese and Kent Roach detailed Murray's Bill 622, noting it was \\"impressive and wide ranging\\", saying \\"Joyce Murray's private members bill proposed an interesting attempt to prevent partisan and government domination of a new committee by providing that no political party should have a majority of committee members. This is a worthy idea.\\"Craig Forcese and Kent Roach, False Security, The Radicalization of Canadian Anti-Terrorism, Irwin Law Inc.,, 2015 http://www.irwinlaw.com/titles/false-security On October 1, it was reported Forcese and Roach had \\"applauded Murray's legislative attempt to deal with the shortcomings of Bill C-51\\".  In government  On October 19, 2015, Joyce Murray was re-elected to represent Vancouver Quadra in the 42nd Canadian federal election.New Talk 980 CKKNW October 19, 2015 http://www.cknw.com/2015/10/19/vancouver-quadra-federal-election-results-2015/ On December 2, 2015, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board. As parliamentary secretary, Murray worked with the Treasury Board to develop a framework for achieving greater GHG reductions across federal government operations. Through collaboration across multiple departments and with provincial and municipal levels of government, and through consultation with climate experts, the Centre for Greening Government was created within the Treasury Board Secretariat in November 2016. According to its webpage, \\"the Centre tracks and reports on the federal government's emissions centrally, coordinates greening efforts across government, and drives results to ensure the Government of Canada meets its greenhouse gas reduction targets. The Centre aims to leverage knowledge, skills and capabilities that can be shared throughout the Government of Canada and among various communities of practice through partnerships with government and non-government organizations, including business and academia.\\" On June 22, 2017, Bill C-22 received Royal Assent, creating the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians. Both the scope and intent of Bill C-22 as well as much of its text was based on Murray's earlier private member's bill C-622. In celebration of Canada 150, Murray created an award for Vancouver Quadra's Hidden Heroes, recognizing locals who had contributed to the community and country. The winners were recognized with certificates and special pins made from the old roof of the Canadian Parliament. In September 2017, Murray was awarded the Canada Clean50 Award recognizing her commitment to fighting climate change and protecting the environment. Murray received the award in recognition of her work on the Centre for Greening Government, and her record of achievement on environmental issues both federally and provincially. In February 2018, Murray travelled to the Digital Nations 2030 conference, held in New Zealand, on behalf of Treasury Board president Scott Brison. There, she signed the D7 charter, making Canada a member of the Digital 7, a group of national governments seeking to encourage faster and more efficient digital government. On March 18, 2019, Murray was appointed President of the Treasury Board. She succeeded Jane Philpott, who had resigned earlier that month in reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The long river is situated on the Seward Peninsula. It flows southeastwards to the Kwiniuk Inlet at the northwestern end of Norton Bay, southwest of Koyuk in the Bering Sea. Its Inuit name was reported as \\"Tubuktulik\\" in 1849 by Capt. Mikhail Dmitrievich Tebenkov of the Imperial Russian Navy. Exploration for placer gold occurred in the Council district area where the river valley is located, and in 1898, mining commenced. The production was substantial and ranked second only to that of Nome. Geography The river is located on the Seward Peninsula of northwestern Alaska. It rises from the southern flank of the Bendeleben Mountains. A geological fault was noted running from the Bendeleben Mountains to the east of the river's headwater. The long waterway flows generally parallel to the mountains whereas its tributaries flow perpendicular to the mountain range. Erosion is a common phenomenon in the river valley; there are many lakes and sloughs. The first of Tubutulik River, like the lower course of the Fish River, is a tortuous channel through alluvial flats built out from material that it brought down from its upper course. After the flats, there is a more restricted valley with the high hills of the Cape Darby granite area to the west and the softer forms of the limestone and schist on the east. Its course passes the mouth of Chukajak Creek. Vulcan Creek and its tributaries enter the main river from the west. Vulcan Point is located on Vulcan Creek. Continuing upstream on the Tubutulik is the lower end of a narrow canyon. Above the canyon, the stream valley broadens out again into a basin of a smaller area but otherwise similar to that of Fish River and is connected with the latter by a low pass used in winter in making the overland trip from Golovnin Bay to Kotzebue Sound. The limits of this basin can be seen from the Bendeleben Mountains. A sand spit lies opposite the mouth of the river. Tubutulik River flows for the greater part of its course through the hilly region which separates the Koyuk and Fish River valleys. It rises in a group of granite mountains south of the source of the Koyuk, flows out into a small basin quite like that of Fish River, though much smaller in area, and enters the hills again at about latitude 65¬∞ 10'. From this point it continues, with many loops and bends and variations in the width of its valley, until it passes into its delta plain, above its mouth. Its largest tributary, Clear Creek, flows in from the southwest about from salt water. Other smaller branches are Vulcan, Chukajak, Admiral, Grouse, and Lost creeks. The first two of these are the only streams belonging to the Tubutulik drainage system The lower course of the river lies in a fluvial plain consisting partly of fresh-water and partly of salt-water marshes, built up by the detrital material carried by the river itself and deposited beyond its mouth in the form of mud, sand, and gravel. The river discharges into a lagoon back of a long island sand spit. This lagoon also receives at its western end the waters of Kwiniuk River. Wildlife Caribou in Alaska The watershed, particularly in the Norton Sound area, is an important habitat for many species of Pacific salmon and fish species. The watershed is also a habitat for migratory birds, and caribou of the Western Arctic herd forage there. Geology The drainage basin of the river has many geological formations such as a wide belt of granite crossing the Kwinium river to the south. Gold mining in the river basin began in 1900 after panning of the surface gravels uncovered coarse gold. Conglomerates were also noted in the bed of the river. Basalt formations were also recorded in the head waters between the Tubutulik River and Grouse Creek. The radioactivity recorded in the area was tested and found to be concentrated in the Tubutulik River and its tributaries at many locations. Three areas on the Tubutulik River contain abnormal radioactivity. Samples were taken from the granite rocks of the river valley including the tributaries and tested. The test results revealed radioactive uranium concentrations of more than 0.2% of equivalent uranium. Watershed management Infrastructure development within the mining area included the Dalton Highway, railroads, and a port. These activities created environmental problems in the form of threat to fish and wildlife habitat. The Watershed Council is currently working to remedy the situation, in association with the Native Alaskan Tribal Government and the Norton Bay Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (NBITWC).

The concept known as dim mak (), alternatively ' () traces its history to traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture. Tales of its use are often found in the Wuxia genre of Chinese martial arts fiction. Dim mak is depicted as a secret body of knowledge with techniques that attack pressure points and meridians, said to incapacitate or sometimes cause immediate or even delayed death to an opponent. Little scientific or historical evidence exists for a martial arts \\"touch of death\\", although it has been confirmed that trauma may cause disproportionately catastrophic consequences when applied to known pressure points under specific circumstances. Commotio cordis, for example, is an often lethal disruption of heart rhythm that occurs as a result of a blow to the area directly over the heart (the precordial region), at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing cardiac arrest. The concept known as vibrating palm originates with the Chinese martial arts Neijing (\\"internal\\") energy techniques that deal with the qi energy and the type of force (jin) used. It is depicted as \\"a technique that is part psychic and part vibratory, this energy is then focused into a wave\\". Claims of practicability Numerous martial artists claim to practice the technique in reality, beginning in the 1960s, when the term was advertised alongside the English translation \\"The Death Touch\\" by American eccentric Count Dante. In 1985, an article in Black Belt magazine speculated that the death of Bruce Lee in 1973 might have been caused by \\"a delayed reaction to a Dim-Mak strike he received several weeks prior to his collapse\\". Other authors have also said Lee's death may have been due to a \\"quivering palm technique\\" (alongside an article about Choy Li Fut instructor Wong Doc- Fai) to the effect that \\"dim mak does actually exist and is still taught to a few select kung fu practitioners.\\"Jane Hallander, \\"The Death Touch\\" in Black Belt , Vol. 23, No. 6 June 1985, pp. 43ff. A 1986 book on qi identifies dim mak as \\"one of the secret specialities\\" of wing chun. William Cheung, Mike Lee, How to Develop Chi Power, Black Belt Communications, 1986, p. 23. However, this matter is not identified in the ving tsun kin kut and traditional practitioners of ving tsun (wing chun) take no stance in the matter. During the late 1980s, Erle Montaigue (1949‚Äì2011) published a number of books and instruction videos on dim mak with Paladin Press. Montaigue claims to be \\"the first Westerner to be granted the degree of 'Master' in taijiquan\\", awarded by Master Wang Xin-Wu in 1985. According to Montaigue's own account, dim mak is an aspect of traditional old Yang style taji quan which he claims he began learning in 1978 from a master called Chiang Yiu-chun who died in the month of May. Montaigue stated this man was an illegal immigrant, making his existence difficult to verify. Erle subsequently learned the remaining \\"qi-disruptive\\" forms of wudang shan from Liang Shih-kan in 1995.taijiworld.com \\"Erle stated he travelled back to Australia upon the death of his father in 1978 and [...] supposedly met Chiang Yiu-chun who became Erle's main internal arts teacher from whom he learnt Tai Chi, Wudang Arts and Dim-Mak. In 1981, Erle travelled to Hong Kong where he met and trained with both Yang Sau-chung (the son of Yang Cheng-fu) and also Ho Ho-choy, a Bagua master.\\" Paladin Press has other titles on the topic of dim mak, including Kelly (2001) and Walker and Bauer (2002), both with a foreword by Montaigue. Around 1990, Taika Seiyu Oyata founded the style of Ry≈´-te which involves \\"pressure point fighting\\" ('). In the 1990s, karate instructor George Dillman developed a style that involves ky≈´shojutsu, a term that he identifies with dim mak. Dillman eventually went as far as claiming to have developed qi-based attacks that work without physical contact (\\"no-touch knockout\\" techniques), a claim that did not stand up to third-party investigation and was consequently denounced as fraudulent.Polidoro, M. Just like Jedi knights Skeptical Inquirer, May/June 2008, p. 21; see also George Dillman explains Chi K.O. nullification. URL accessed on June 13, 2009. In East Asian popular culture A \\"Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique\\" appears in both the Shaw Brothers films Clan of the White Lotus (1980) and Executioners of Shaolin (1977). It is used by the protagonist in the climax of Kill Bill: Volume 2.YouTube: Kill Bill - Five point palm exploding heart technique explainedYouTube:Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) - The Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique Scene The \\"delayed action\\" of dim mak is depicted in Executioners of Shaolin (1977), where a \\"100-step Soul Catching\\" move allows the victim to take a certain number of steps before dying. A dim mak attack is used to paralyze a character in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). The manga Fist of the North Star centers around the fictional martial art school called Hokuto Shinken, whose practitioners are trained to kill or incapacitate opponents by striking the specific pressure points on an opponent's body. The protagonist of the story, Kenshiro, is the successor of this style and will often end a battle stating how much time the opponent has left to live after delivering a finishing move, or follow up with his famous catchphrase, \\"You are already dead\\", before his opponent dies, usually from violently exploding. In the Naruto series, and its sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Dim Mak is a basis for the fictional Gentle Fist fighting style used by the Hyuga Clan. In contemporary western pop culture  Dim mak has become a kind of camp pop culture item which is recognized also outside the genre of martial arts films. In Thomas Pynchon's novel Vineland, one of the protagonists uses the \\"Quivering Palm Death Touch\\", which kills the opponent one year after it is used. In the TV series Quincy, M.E., a 1977 episode entitled \\"Touch of Death\\" features a martial-arts movie star whose mysterious death is found to be a result of a dim mak attack against him ten days earlier. The lead character of the British TV series Gangsters (1978) is murdered by hired assassin \\"The White Devil\\" using a similar attack, with death occurring four days after he is touched.Interview with series writer Philip Martin, who also played The White Devil (2003) Dan Brown's novel Inferno depicts a character incapacitating a guard by putting pressure on his wrist, explaining the technique as \\"Dim Mak\\". In the comedy film The Men Who Stare at Goats, George Clooney's character claims to have been hit with the Touch of Death, a \\"light tap\\" that causes death at an unknown point in the future, in one case \\"about eighteen years later\\". In the Star Trek universe, the Vulcan nerve pinch is frequently used as a non-lethal method of applying pressure to a pressure point in order to render the target unconscious. In Doctor Who, the Third Doctor describes himself as a master of Venusian aikido on various occasions, accounting for his unique form of hand-to-hand combat, which allows him to immobilize opponents in a manner similar to the Vulcan nerve pinch. Later incarnations of the Doctor have shown varying degrees of expertise in hand-to- hand combat, although only some spin-off material explicitly identifies the later Doctors' combat skills as originating from Venusian aikido. In the Kung Fu Panda movie series, the Wuxi Finger Hold technique used by Po is a form of Dim Mak. Likewise, the villain Tai Lung and the mentor Oogway both use a nerve-strike attack to paralyze the opponent. In the Avatar: The Last Airbender series, Ty Lee used a form of Dim Mak called Chi-Blocking to cripple or immobilize opponents. The fighting style is reintroduced in The Legend of Korra as the primary fighting style of the Equalists. In The Simpsons episode \\"When Flanders Failed\\", Bart Simpson claims to have learned the touch of death in his karate classes ‚Äî having actually stolen the concept from an arcade game ‚Äî and uses the threat of using it on Lisa to make her perform tasks. In the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Day of the Samurai\\", Kyodai Ken, Bruce Wayne's rival from his days training in Japan, forces Master Yoru to reveal his secret death touch. Wayne survives the technique by wearing a protective pad to absorb the force of the blow. In the Robert Rankin stories Hugo Rune, and others, are credited as practitioners of \\"Dimac\\", described as the deadliest martial art known to man, capable of disfiguring and dismembering the opponent with the slightest touch, or condemning the victim \\"to forever walk sideways in the manner of a crab\\". Rune himself claims to have been taught by Count Dante, and the character of Archroy later becomes a Dimac master himself, although he is initially prevented from taking revenge on Omalley as he was not provided with the book on defensive strategy. Although not mentioned as dim mak, the ability to kill with a mere touch is attributed to Chiun, the mentor of Remo Williams, who is the protagonist in the long- running The Destroyer novel series. The style of martial art practiced by Chiun is called Sinanju, which incorporates the idea of acupuncture meridians. In the 1985 film Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, Chiun uses this knowledge to render a female Army major helpless, bringing her to over- heightened levels of sexual arousal and pleasure by simply tapping her wrist. In the 2012 Square Enix video game, Sleeping Dogs, Dim Mak is a counter- attacking move that can be learned from the protagonist's Sifu (master). Dim mak is referenced in Bloodsport (1988), a film allegedly \\"based on true events in the life of Frank Dux\\", the founder of the first Neo-ninja school of \\"American Style Ninjutsu\\". In the film, Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) proves that he has been trained by Master Tanaka by demonstrating a move described as a dim mak or \\"death touch\\" attack to the judges as a means to gain entry into a full contact Kumite by striking a stack of five bricks with his hand and breaking only the bottom brick. Dux also uses the dim mak technique on Pumola during the Kumite before delivering a Johnny Cage-esque coup de grace, ending the match. The monk class in Dungeons & Dragons has a high-level \\"Quivering Palm\\" ability that can mark an opponent for death and be activated later to kill them with lethal vibrations. Five Finger Death Punch, also abbreviated as 5FDP or FFDP, is an American heavy metal band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2005. The band's name comes from the subgenre of Kung fu film, martial arts films and Hong Kong action cinema set in the contemporary period and featuring realistic martial arts. And as mentioned briefly in the preceding section for its appearances in East Asian popular culture, Dim Mak does in fact play a prominent role in \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2,\\" a 2004 American martial arts film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. A martial arts teacher named Pai Mei kept his Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique secret from all of his students, except one. It is a death blow that once executed, kills any opponent after they have taken five steps. The move consists of a series of powerful jabs from the fingertips into five different pressure points on the victim's body. Once finished, the victim is then allowed to walk away. However, once they take five steps, their heart literally explodes inside their body, killing them instantly. The protagonist uses the technique at the climax of the film against the titular main antagonist.

It was established in the Philippines for training future officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Philippine Army located at Brgy. Sta. Lucia, Capas, Tarlac The School trains civilians and enlisted personnel holding a baccalaureate degree for the officer candidate course (OCC); one-year leadership and management graduate course which prepares an officer candidate (OC) with a rank of Probationary Second Lieutenant and Probationary Ensign to be mentally, physically and emotionally fit to earn a commission as an officer in the Philippine Army, the Philippine Air Force, and the Philippine Navy. Graduates of this School are commissioned as Second Lieutenants and Ensigns in the AFP Regular and Reserve Forces by the President of the Republic of the Philippines who also serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the AFP. Since its creation, more than 3,000 officers have graduated from the Officer Candidate School. The school‚Äôs motto Valor, Integrity, and Duty still remains strong and relevant despite changes in the society and government. History The story of the Officer Candidate School began during the formation of the School for Reserve Commission in 1937. Three Schools were set up, two for the Infantry in Tarlac and Lanao, and one for the Field Artillery in Mabalacat, Pampanga. These schools were active until the Second World War reached the shores of the Philippines in 1941. After the war, the school was reactivated and transferred to Fort McKinley under the Philippine Army School Center, Philippine Army Training Command. For the Philippine Air Force, they produced three classes of officer candidates at Nichols Air Base before the PA SRC was reestablished. Three classes were held during April 1951 to May 1953. Graduates of the said program subsequently earned their commissions in the AFP Reserve Force. Following this, the Ground Combat School, PASC took over the training in Fort McKinley. SRC Classes 7 to 25 were trained during the period of September 1954 to April 1959 until it was stopped. The school was then transferred to Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, and the SRC was directed by higher headquarters to conduct instead a Non- commissioned Officer Course. NCOC courses 1 to 3 were completed from April 1959 to January 1960. Philippine Army officer candidates march on the parade grounds during Balikatan 2013 at Camp O'Donnell, Tarlac. The SRC resumed its training courses when it was transferred to Camp Tinio in Bangad, Cabanatuan City in 1975. After its first class (CL 1-75), the name SRC was changed to the AFP Officer Candidate School (AFPOCS) while still continuing the SRC program of instruction. Before being deactivated once again in 1979, the AFPOCS completed seven classes while one SRC class in 1975 was conducted exclusively for the Philippine Air Force. The next reincarnation of AFPOCS was at Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal in 1987. Seventeen classes, including the four pioneer members of the Women's Auxiliary Corps (WAC) of OCS Cl 02-88 were produced by the AFPOCS. Upon the deactivation of the AFP Training Command, the OCS transferred to the control of TRADOC, PA. In October 1996, 105 former members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) graduated as officers of the Philippine Army pursuant to the 1996 peace agreement between the MNLF and the Government. Some noteworthy members who made star ranks include Brigadier Generals Leandro Lonzame and Ruso Sabalones of the pre-WW2 SRC. Brigadier Generals Alexander Felix, Armando Mateo, and Rogelio Martin were products of SRC classes in Fort McKinley. Notable SRC Bangad graduates include J/Director Arturo W Alit. OCS class 02-88 pride themselves with including in their ranks Maj Dahlia Nograles PN and Maj Ester Bautista PN, the 1st skipper and executive officer of the 1st all-female crewed PN vessel.

She was the name ship of the Weymouth sub-class of the Town class. The ship survived the First World War and was sold for scrap in 1928.

Two of these guns were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and two more were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast the bridge. The remaining four guns were positioned on the upper deck in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were also fitted. Their armament was completed by two submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.Lyon, Part 2, pp. 55‚Äì57 The Weymouth-class ships were considered protected cruisers, with an armoured deck providing protection for the ships' vitals. The armoured deck was thick over the magazines and machinery, over the steering gear and elsewhere. The conning tower was protected by 4 inches of armour, with the gun shields having armour, as did the ammunition hoists.Lyon, Part 2, p. 59 As the protective deck was at waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly making them poor gun platforms.Brown, p. 63 One problem with the armour of the Weymouths which was shared with the other Town-class ships was the sizable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap, which resulted in leg injuries to the ships' gun crews.Lyon, Part 2, p. 57 Construction and career The ship was laid down on 19 January 1910 by Armstrong Whitworth at their Elswick shipyard and launched on 18 November. Upon completion in October 1911, Weymouth was assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet and was transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean in June 1913. In August 1914, Weymouth was detached to sail into the Indian Ocean to hunt for the German light cruiser , which was raiding Allied shipping in the area. In February 1915, she was operating off the East African coast as part of operations against another commerce raider, , eventually trapping her in the Rufiji River until she could be sunk. At Skyros Island, Greece in 1915 showing the new wartime camouflage paint pattern Weymouth was transferred to the Adriatic in December 1915. In 1916 she returned to home waters and was assigned to the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet.

Journalism Duffy graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1961 from Marywood College in Scranton, Pennsylvania. After college, she took her vows as a Catholic nun and was known as Sister Jude Michael before leaving the convent after a year. Duffy worked at newspapers in Scranton and Cortland, New York before moving to Syracuse to work for the Herald-Journal, where she was a police beat reporter. She left that job in 1967 to work as a reporter at WHEN- AM and WHEN-TV (now WTVH). She took a year off from reporting in 1970, when she became press secretary for Syracuse Mayor Lee Alexander. She then returned to WTVH, where she worked as a reporter for six years before going to work at what was then WNYS-TV (later WIXT, now WSYR-TV) in 1977. For years, she anchored brief local news and weather reports that aired during breaks in ABC's Good Morning America. While she often covered breaking news, she once said she favored the lighter stories. She filed features at WIXT billed as \\"Duffy's People\\", which were gentle profiles of ordinary people with extraordinary stories. In the early 1990s, Duffy hosted \\"The Irish Connection\\", a half-hour public affairs show than ran on Public-access television. She was president of the Syracuse Press Club from 1991 to 1992, and was honored by the club in 2000 with induction into its Wall of Distinction located at the John H. Mulroy Civic Center. Parade Duffy helped revive and organize, for several years, Syracuse's Saint Patrick's Parade, which had been discontinued during World War II. She, with the leadership of other Syracusians, helped lead a small group of volunteers in putting together the first parade on March 19, 1983. The parade remains a major annual event, typically drawing an estimated crowd of up to 10,000 marchers and 125,000 spectators gathering along South Salina Street each year on the usually cold and snowy Saturday in March. She considered her greatest legacy to be the Syracuse St. Patrick's Parade. Through the years the parade has become Central New York‚Äôs largest one-day event, ‚Äúthe largest St. Patrick‚Äôs Parade, per capita, in the world.‚Äù Duffy served as the parade committee's first co-president with Daniel F. Casey, and continued as a guiding force even after stepping down in 1997. After Duffy resigned in as president of the parade, she continued as president-emeritus, where she shouldered the bulk of the work in organizing the event for several more years. Surplus earnings from the parade over the years were donated to one of Duffy's favorite causes, Project Children, an organization that brings children from Northern Ireland to Central New York for six weeks. The stretch of Salina Boulevard traversed by the annual St Patrick's Day parade has been named \\"Nancy Duffy Lane\\" in her honor. Personal life Duffy also taught at Syracuse University, wrote poetry, created charcoal and chalk drawings, led a campaign to save the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra, and volunteered for a wide range of civic organizations and causes, often with links to her Irish heritage. In 1995, the Barnes & Noble bookstore in DeWitt hosted an appearance at which Duffy read some of her own poetry, which was inspired by events she covered in Syracuse TV. She also led at least one poetry workshop for children. Duffy also created numerous charcoal and chalk drawings, many with Civil War or Catholic themes. In recent years, several local public libraries exhibited a collection of Duffy's drawings entitled \\"Native American Faces.\\" Nancy had established close ties with American Indians during her coverage of the 71-day armed standoff in 1973 between federal authorities and American Indians at Wounded Knee in South Dakota. Because of her close ties to the Onondaga Nation, Duffy was invited to deliver a walking stick to President Clinton on behalf of the six-nation Iroquois Confederacy after his round of golf in 1999 at LaFayette Country Golf & Country Club. In 1985, The Post- Standard honored Duffy with one of its annual Women of Achievement awards, which has since been renamed The Post-Standard Achievement Award. Among the numerous other honors she received was the Trailblazer in the Media Award in 1984 from the Central New York Chapter of the National Organization for Women. Divorced she raised two sons, Matthew, a lawyer in Cleveland, and Peter, a journalist and author living in New York City. Death Duffy had suffered from ill health for several years. In 1996, she underwent an operation in Cleveland to repair a leaking heart valve. At Duffy's invitation, WIXT sent a reporting team to tape the surgery for on-air reports. Nancy Duffy died Friday, December 22, 2006, after a long illness.http://www.tvjobs.com/ , as printed Saturday, December 23, 2006,By William LaRue, Staff writer, Syracuse Post Standard, Syracuse, New York, USA.

The crater is expressed as a rimless circular flat-floored depression, in diameter, within mountainous and heavily forested terrain. It is east of the West Coast Range and the former North Mount Lyell Railway formation. Discovery and description The crater was discovered by the geologist R. J. Ford in 1972, after a search for the source of Darwin glass, an impact glass found over more than of southwestern Tasmania. Geophysical investigations and drilling have shown that the crater is filled with up to of breccia capped by Pleistocene lake sediments. Although definitive proof of an impact origin of the crater is lacking, the impact hypothesis is strongly supported by the relationship of the glass to the crater, as well as the stratigraphy and deformation of the crater-filling material. If the crater is indeed the source of the glass, the age of Darwin Crater is 816,000 ¬± 7,000 years‚Äîthe age of Darwin glass as determined by argon dating methods.

It is one of the most diverse areas of the city. It takes its name from Rancho San Antonio, the name of the land as granted to Lu√≠s Mar√≠a Peralta by the last Spanish governor of California. History The settlement that became San Antonio began in 1851 when J. B. Larue purchased Peralta's land west of San Antonio Creek. The site was west of Clinton. Larue built a store and wharf and the community grew up around them. The San Francisco and Oakland Railroad built a station at San Antonio. When the Central Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1870, the name was changed to Brooklyn. When the Southern Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1883, the name was changed to East Oakland. Clinton and San Antonio joined in 1856 to form a new town called Brooklyn named after the ship that had brought Mormon settlers to California in 1846. Brooklyn joined with nearby Lynn to incorporate in 1870 under the name Brooklyn. In 1872, Brooklyn voters approved their city's annexation by Oakland. Neighborhoods The district is made up of a number of smaller neighborhoods, each with its own distinct personality, history and demographics. *Bella Vista *Cleveland Heights *Clinton *East Peralta/Eastlake *Highland Park *Highland Terrace *Ivy Hill *Jingletown *Lynn *Meadow Brook *Merritt *Oak Tree *Rancho San Antonio *Reservoir Hill *Tuxedo Cleveland Heights Cleveland Heights, also known as Haddon Hill by local realtors, is located at the northwestern corner of the San Antonio district, perched on a hill overlooking Lake Merritt. It was formerly the township of Brooklyn prior to its annexation by Oakland in 1909. The neighborhood is commonly known as the area encompassed by Lakeshore Avenue on Lake Merritt, East 18th Street, Park Boulevard, and MacArthur Boulevard/I-580 MacArthur Freeway. The neighborhood includes Oakland High School in the east corner of the neighborhood. It is commonly known as China Hill because of the large Chinese population that lives there. Eastlake The Eastlake district, formerly known as East Peralta, comprises the area along International Blvd. between 1st and 14th Avenues. It is currently the site of an ethnic enclave, housing many immigrants of southeast Asian origin. East 12th Street has a large Vietnamese American population, and has many Vietnamese restaurants and businesses. There is a Vietnamese American Community Center located at International Boulevard. There are also sizable populations of Cambodian Americans and Laotian Americans.American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau Highland Park Highland Park is the area immediately surrounding Highland Hospital, loosely bounded by 14th Avenue on the south, East 31st Street to the north, and 13th Avenue to the west. It is known as Funktown to Oakland residents. The name Funktown derives from the name of a local gang Funktown USA that once occupied the area. The gang was a notorious rival of Felix Mitchell's 6-9 Mob as the two struggled for control over the East Oakland drug trade. As Funktown USA's membership dwindled in the late 1980s. East Oakland residents simply referred to the Highland Park and China Hill neighborhoods as \\"Funktown\\". Funktown's boundaries are east of 7th Avenue and west of 19th Avenue, South of East 31st Street and North of International Boulevard. The majority of Highland Park's residents are ethnic minorities, with a relatively even split between Latinos, Asians, and African-Americans. Jingletown The subsection of the neighborhood adjacent to the Oakland Estuary is called Jingletown, also called \\"JT\\" by East Oakland natives.Jingletown Arts and Business Community The name originated from long ago when there was a Portuguese community in the area and men would gather around on the street corners chatting amongst each other with their hands in their pockets jingling coins. Lynn Lynn was an early settlement, located northeast of Brooklyn. In 1870, Lynn and Brooklyn incorporated as Brooklyn In 1872, voters approved the annexation by Oakland. Lynn hosted a large shoe and boot factory, and was named after Lynn, Massachusetts which also had a large footwear industry. The Twomps \\"The Twomps\\" is a local name for the neighborhood between 20th and 29th Avenues. It is also known as \\"The Rolling '20s\\", \\"The Roaring '20s\\", or \\"Murder Dubbs\\", references to its history of drug trafficking and gang violence. The area was known as The Twomps in the 1980s, but became known as Murder Dubs in the early 1990s due to a dramatic rise in drug-related violence. The landmark avenue for the Twomps is 23rd Avenue, which also serves as the primary thoroughfare for which Twomps residents get to other main city boulevards. 23rd Avenue is heavily traveled on for its numerous stores, laundromats, and other neighborhood services.

Born on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean on July 26, 1720, the daughter of James Wilson and Elizabeth Fulton Wilson, Mary grew up in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where she married James Wallace on December 18, 1742. She had four sons, Robert, William, Thomas, and James Wallace, and one daughter, Elizabeth. Three of the sons married sisters, the daughters of Robert and Mary Moore of Londonderry: Robert to Jeannette Moore, William to Hannah Moore, and James to Anna Moore. Elizabeth married Lieutenant Thomas Patterson of the New Hampshire militia. Life Mary's background was Scottish through Ireland. Her father died shortly after the ship landed in Boston, and her mother remarried to James Clarke prior to settlement in Londonderry. During the voyage to the United States, the ship (reputedly called the Wolf) was overtaken by pirates who threatened to loot the ship and sink it with all on board. When the pirate captain heard the cry of an infant, he went below to discover Mrs. Wilson holding her newborn daughter. The pirate captain told Mrs. Wilson that if she would do him the honor of naming the baby after his own mother Mary, he would spare the ship and depart peacefully. Mrs. Wilson agreed, and the pirates departed, but not before the pirate captain briefly returned to the Wolf with a bolt of green brocade silk, which he presented to Mrs. Wilson, stating that it was for little Mary's wedding gown. While Mary did in fact wear the brocade on her wedding day, she may not have been the first to do so, as when her mother remarried the cloth may have been used on that occasion as well. As an adult, Mary wed James Wallace. They were married for 39 years, until October 30, 1781, when James died in Londonderry and was buried in the Hill Burying Ground there. In 1798, Mary moved in with her son William at his home in Henniker. Ocean Born Mary died on February 13, 1814, aged 93. She is buried in the Center Burying Ground in Henniker. Her sons and son-in-law were all prominent men in New Hampshire. Ocean Born Mary was described as being a handsome woman over six feet tall, with red hair and bright green eyes. While reports of her physical appearance cannot be verified, all her sons were known to be very tall, red-haired, and green-eyed, which might lend credibility to the description. She was said to be elegant in her manners, resolute and determined, of strong mind, quick of comprehension, sharp in her conversation, and very witty, with a strong brogue. Pieces of the gown she married in are scattered in various places, including the New Hampshire Historical Society. The folk song \\"Ocean-Born Mary\\" by Neptune's Car was inspired by Mary's story. Reputation Ocean-Born-Mary House, Route 202 vicinity, Henniker, Merrimack County, NH HABS NH,7-HEN,2-1 Mary's claim to fame is as a reputed ghost, though Mary herself never lived in the house she is said to haunt. There were two Wallace houses in the town of Henniker, one the home of Mary's son Robert, the other home to her son William. After her husband's death, Mary lived with William, but she did not care for Robert and rarely visited his home. William Wallace's house became the town poorhouse in 1840, and in 1923, it burned to the ground. Robert's home, built in 1760, still stands and is said to be the location of the haunting. The story of the haunting was begun by Louis Roy, who owned the Robert Wallace house. According to Roy's story, the same pirate captain who spared Mary's ship reunited with her in her widowhood, and she took him into her home and cared for him in his old age. Allegedly the captain was murdered under Mary's roof, and Mary buried him and his treasure under the hearthstone in accordance with his instructions. Her ghost was said to haunt the house in order to protect the hidden treasure. Lost strangers stopping at the house to ask for directions were said to be met at the door by a tall red- haired woman in colonial dress, who they assumed to be an historical reenactor. Others claim to have seen a similar figure in the yard or walking on the road into town. No evidence of either treasure or human remains has been found at either Wallace house, and the story is considered by townsfolk and historians to be entirely invented.

Some other cyclopyrrolone drugs include zopiclone and eszopiclone. Pazinaclone has a very similar pharmacological profile to the benzodiazepines including sedative and anxiolytic properties, but with less amnestic effects, and at low doses it is a relatively selective anxiolytic, with sedative effects only appearing at higher doses. Pazinaclone produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects by acting as a partial agonist at GABAA benzodiazepine receptors, although pazinaclone is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines. Synthesis Pazinaclone synthesis: Reaction of 2-amino-7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridine with phthalic anhydride leads to the corresponding phthalimide. Selective reduction of one of the imide carbonyl groups in essence converts that to an aldehyde. Condensation with tert- butyl(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate gives the Wittig product. The carboxylic acid is then treated with diethyl cyanophosphonate to convert that to an activated acid cyanide; reaction with 1,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane results in formation of the corresponding amide, pazinaclone.

It has also been credited with rank \\"53\\" by National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and Rank \\"150\\" by QS BRICS 2019. Campuses The inception of the University of Kashmir dates back to the establishment of Jammu and Kashmir University in 1948. In 1969 it was made into two full- fledged universities: University of Kashmir at Srinagar and University of Jammu at Jammu. The University of Kashmir, since its establishment, has been focused at Hazratbal and encompasses three adjacent areas: Amar Singh Bagh, Naseem Bagh and Mirza Bagh. This campus is spread over . It is the largest university by number of full-time students in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. A major part of Amar Singh Bagh and Naseem Bagh constitute the Hazratbal campus which is laid out on the northeastern bank of Dal Lake. Earlier, many postgraduate departments, research and other centres were housed in Naseem Bagh. But the university resolved to develop Naseem Bagh into a heritage site and, thereafter, many departments were shifted to other areas of the Hazratbal campus. Zakura Campus is being developed on 300 kanals of land in close proximity to Hazratbal campus to meet expansion requirements of the university. Mirza Bagh or \\"University Town\\" constitutes buildings housing quarters for the university staff. The idea of extending postgraduate programmes to colleges and establishing new campuses at Ananthnag and Baramulla was conceived by the then Vice Chancellor Prof Raees ahmad in 2002. He mobilised over 30 crores for the development of the university from the prime minister's fund for the overall development of the main campus and the establishment of the new campuses. The foundation stones were laid by Mufti Muhammad Sayeed and the plans of buildings were approved. The locations of the campuses had to be changed because of likely floods. After Prof Tareen the development of campuses took a longer time and became operational in 2008/2009. The new social science block, the life science block, the examination block, the humanities block, the distance education block, the media block and many other buildings were constructed in 2001 and 2004 during Prof Tareen's period out of the PMs special fund. The 200-capacity convention centre was also completed. The South Campus established on 259 kanals of land at Fateh Garh, Anantnag was started in October 2008. The North Campus on 559 kanals at Delina, Baramulla was started in December 2009. Three more campuses at Kupwara, Kargil and Leh are coming up.  Present form  The University of Kashmir has grown into one of the largest universities. There are 12 faculties, 47 academic departments, 21 centres, 36 colleges and six (privately managed) recognised institutes spread all over the state. The two largest departments in student enrolment include Faculty of Law and the Business School. The Faculty of Law being one of the oldest departments runs three courses LLB, LLM and B.A, LLB(Hons). The Faculty of Law has been successfully pursuing higher standards of academic excellence. The department has produced eminent jurists, lawyers, authors, civil servants and politicians. The department's student body, \\"Law Society,\\" actively organises debates, seminars, and moot court competitions. The faculty publishes a refereed research journal, Kashmir University Law Review (KULR), which is acclaimed across the country and appreciated by academia, eminent lawyers and judges. The Business School has become an iconic institution in the field of management education and has been playing an incredible role in the growth of corporate sector and management education in India. Its Integrated MBA (IMBA) and Master of Tourism & Hospitality Management (MTHM) programmes are unique blends of strategic thinking, pragmatism in implementation and cutting-edge on relevance.

It was the second iteration of the fifth generation of this Australian-made model and also included the Ford Fairmont (EB)‚Äîthe luxury- oriented version of the Falcon.  Introduction and changes  Visually, the 1991 EB Falcon remained nearly identical to its predecessor, including carrying over the 3.9-litre Ford straight-six engine and four-speed M85LE automatic. The most noticeable changes were the transfer of the Ford emblem from the tip of the bonnet to the grille and a full-length applique bridging the gap between the tail lights, featuring reversing lamps on both sides of the rear number plate. Additionally, the C-pillar air vents were removed. The return of the V8 engine since its demise in the Ford Falcon (XE) of 1982 was welcomed by the motoring press, but the 5.0-litre Windsor unit did not reappear in the utility variants until the \\"EF-shaped\\" XH series of 1996. The V8 was paired to the four-speed M95LE automatic transmission. Changes also were made to the front suspension geometry, giving the EB a much better level of grip and steering feel. With the new model, Ford reintroduced the sports oriented GT specification level, an exclusive 250-unit run celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first original Falcon GT. The first XR6 and XR8 sports models appeared in the EB series.  Model range = Series I  The model range of the first series on sale from August 1991 comprised these variants: * GL * S * S XR8 * Fairmont * Fairmont Ghia File:1991 Ford Falcon (EB) GL sedan (26634211185).jpg  Falcon GL sedan File:1991 Ford Falcon (EB) S station wagon (25933552654).jpg  Falcon S wagon File:1991 Ford Falcon (EB) S XR8 sedan (2010-12-17).jpg  Falcon S XR8 sedan File:1991-1992 Ford EB Fairmont Ghia sedan 02.jpg  Fairmont Ghia sedan  Series II  The revised Series II (EB II) model, appearing in showrooms in April 1992, had the six-cylinder engine upsized by 35 cm3 (from 3949 to 3984 cm3). This brought the nominal total swept capacity to 4.0 litres. The automatic transmission was updated to the M91LE specification, and the electronics were also improved, and the styling was tweaked. The base model now had body-coloured bumpers, and the previously matte black plastic exterior door handles were now given a glossy finish. The update reportedly cost . Innovation became an evident strength in the EB II: antilock brakes became an option, a Falcon first, and in 1993, a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard. The EB also introduced the \\"Smartlock\\" security locking system. South Australian Police revealed the operational success of \\"Smartlock\\" by inviting four professional car thieves to steal either a Holden Calais (VN) or an EB specified with the locking system. The successful theft of the motor vehicle meant the thief could keep the vehicle indefinitely. The thieves made off with the VN in under 60 seconds, but gave up on the EB after four days' efforts. Therefore, the EB was classified unstealable. Foam-filled A pillars also featured, which greatly increased crush protection and stiffened the frame, thus helping to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness. The rarest model was the SS, with just 10 produced. The EB II SS was built to be successful under Group 3E Series Production Cars, five were absorbed immediately into production car racing. The forthcoming Tickford-enhanced S XR6 replaced the role of the SS. Production of the EB Falcon range totalled 36,374 with 84,847 examples of the EB II being produced. The EB II was replaced by the Ford Falcon (ED) in August 1993. Note: GLi and Fairmont were available with either the 4.0-litre I6 or 5.0-litre V8. S and S XR6 were only available with 4.0-litre, and the S XR8 offered the 5.0-litre V8. * GLi * S * S XR6 * S XR8 * Fairmont * Fairmont Ghia * GT File:1992 Ford Falcon (EB II) GLi sedan (24948334881).jpg  EB II Falcon GLi sedan File:1992-1993 Ford EB II Falcon S sedan 06.jpg  EB II Falcon S sedan File:1992-1993 Ford EB II Fairmont sedan 04.jpg  EB II Fairmont sedan File:Ford EBII Falcon GT.jpg  EB II Falcon GT sedan = XR and GT by Tickford = The EB Series II had the first models from the joint venture between Ford and Tickford Vehicle Engineering. A new model was introduced, the S XR6, featuring Tickford enhancements to the engine and suspension. Similarly, the S XR8 was improved over the existing Series I S XR8. TVE re- introduced the sports orientated 25th anniversary EB Falcon GT specification level, an exclusive 250-unit run celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first original Falcon GT.  Motorsport  The Falcon (EB) SS was raced in the 1993 Australian Production Car Championship, with Mal Rose claiming a championship win, after finishing first four times in six rounds. Marking the return of the Falcon to top-level touring car racing for the first time since 1984, the Group A 5.0-litre touring car specification EB Falcon had impressive success in the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship. This was the first season run under the new Group 3A rules, with the EB winning seven of nine rounds. Glenn Seton Racing carried the bulk of success, with drivers Glenn Seton and 1980 World Drivers Champion Alan Jones finishing first and second, respectively. The Dick Johnson Racing Falcons driven by John Bowe and Dick Johnson managed to score third and fifth. The Seton team's second EB Falcon driven by Geoff Brabham and David Parsons won the 1993 Sandown 500 (the first Falcon to win the Sandown endurance race since Allan Moffat in an XB Falcon GT hardtop in 1974), though a mid-year aerodynamic package given to the Holden Commodore (VP)'s made the Falcons not as competitive at Bathurst. The Falcon received its own upgrade in 1994 with the addition of small wings on the side of the front air dam, which brought it back into contention. This allowed the DJR Falcon driven by Dick Johnson and John Bowe to win both the 1994 Sandown 500 and the 1994 Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst. This was the Falcon's first Bathurst win since Johnson and John French won the crash-shortened 1981 race in an XD Falcon and the Falcon's 9th Phillip Island/Bathurst win overall.

Palace of Justice. The court of assizes (, , ) is the trial court which tries the most serious crimes in the judicial system of Belgium. It is the highest Belgian court with criminal jurisdiction, and as such, it is the only Belgian court that can sentence someone to life imprisonment. The courts of assizes are not permanent courts; a new court of assizes is assembled for each new trial (see further below). There is a court of assizes in each of the ten provinces of Belgium, and one in the arrondissement of Brussels-Capital (which is not part of any province). Further below, an overview is provided of the eleven courts of assizes and their seats. They are the only courts in Belgium for which the provinces are used as territorial subdivisions. They are also the only courts in Belgium that hold jury trials. The jury acts as sole trier of fact, but decides on the penalty together with the judges. The trial by jury of certain crimes is laid down in article 150 of the Belgian Constitution. The Belgian courts of assizes have the same origin as their French namesakes. The organisation of the courts of assizes and the applicable rules of criminal procedure are laid down in the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure. The language in which the proceedings of the courts of assizes are held depends on the official languages of their province: Dutch for the courts of assizes of Antwerp, Limburg, East Flanders, West Flanders and Flemish Brabant, Dutch and French for the court of assizes of Brussels, French for the courts of assizes of Walloon Brabant, Hainaut, Namur and Luxembourg, and French and German for the court of assizes of Li√®ge. The use of languages in judicial matters is a sensitive topic in Belgium, and is strictly regulated by the law.  Court structure = Judges  A court of assizes is presided over by a counsellor (, , ) from the court of appeal (judges at the courts of appeal are officially called counsellors), who is assisted by two assessors (, , ), who are judges from the tribunal of first instance. These three judges are appointed to each assizes trial by the first president of the court of appeal. They sit together in the form of a panel, lead by the counsellor of the court of appeal. For the sake of readability, the counsellor will be referred to as the 'presiding judge' in this article. In order to distinguish the different ranks of the judges, the two assessors from the tribunal of first instance wear their black court robes with white band, whilst the counsellor from the court of appeal wears a ceremonial court robe that uses the color red in addition to black. The judges are always assisted by a clerk. In exceptional cases, alternate judges can be appointed to an assizes trial as well, who will replace a judge who can no longer serve for no matter which reason during the trial.  Jury  The court of assizes is, aside from the three judges, also composed of a jury of twelve people. These twelve jurors (, , ) are selected at random off the electoral rolls used for the Belgian federal elections. However, a jury may not count more than eight people of the same sex; a jury with less than four men or four women may thus not be impaneled. In order to be selected as a juror, one must be aged between 28 and 65, be able to read and write in the language of the trial, not be a clergyperson, the holder of certain public offices or in active military service, not be disqualified from the exercise of civil and political rights by means of a judgement, and not have received a criminal sentence above a certain threshold. Up to twelve alternate jurors can be selected as well. Serving on an assizes jury is considered to be a civic duty and legally obligated; a potential juror may thus not be dismissed from their jury duty without a valid reason. Jurors do however receive a stipend for their service. Since the jurors are not merely triers of fact, but also have a say over the penalty, they can also be viewed as lay judges.  Prosecution, accused and civil parties  Since the court of assizes is not a permanent court, there is no public prosecutor's office attached to it. The prosecution of (suspected) offenders is undertaken by the prosecutor-general's office (, , ) attached to the court of appeal. The prosecutor-general's office may also delegate the prosecution to a lower prosecutor's office. The defendant in an assizes trial is referred to as the accused (, , ). The accused is required to be assisted by counsel; if they have not picked one, the court will appoint one to them. Any accused who does not speak the language of the trial will be appointed an interpreter by the court as well. Any victim in a case can also bring a civil action against the accused in an assizes trial. It is a feature of the Belgian judicial system in general, that courts and tribunals having jurisdiction over criminal cases can also decide on any civil damages sought by a victim (referred to as the civil party). A judgement made by a court of assizes is literally called an 'arrest' (, , ) in order to distinguish it from the judgements of lower tribunals; it might also be translated into English as a 'decision' or 'ruling'. For the sake of readability, the term 'judgement' will be used in this article.  Courtroom layout  The courtroom where a court of assizes is held, requires a particular layout due to the presence of a jury. In general, the three judges (with the presiding judge in the middle) sit behind a bench at the back of the courtroom, with the prosecutor-general or his delegate sitting on one side and the court clerk sitting on the other side next to the bench. The accused, guarded by police officers, sits in a box to the same side of the courtroom as where the prosecutor-general or his delegate sits, with the defense counsel sitting in front of the box. In some cases, the accused's box may be fitted with bulletproof glass. To the other side of the courtroom, opposite the accused's box and to the same side as the court clerk, is the jury box where the jury sits. In the middle of the courtroom, in between the bench, the accused's box and the jury box, is the witness stand where witnesses take place in order to testify. At the front of the courtroom are benches for the civil parties and the news media, with seats for the general public in front of those. The courtroom is often fitted with television screens or video projectors meant to display video evidence or presentations by expert witnesses. The details of the individual layout may of course vary from courtroom to courtroom.  Jurisdiction = Serious crimes  The courts of assizes have original jurisdiction over all crimes (, , ) that have not been correctionalised. Crimes are the most serious category of crimes under Belgian law (comparable to major felonies); correctionalisation refers to the process which allows for crimes to be tried by the correctional division of a tribunal of first instance instead of a court of assizes. The process of correctionalisation requires the prosecutor to assume the existence of extenuating circumstances. The decision on whether to correctionalise a crime is taken by the council chamber (, , ) of the tribunal of first instance at the end of a judicial investigation, or during the indictment proceedings before the chamber of indictment (, , ) of the court of appeal (see further below). In practice, most crimes except for the most severe ones are correctionalised due to the heavy burden an assizes trial imposes on the judicial system. This heavy burden is caused by, amongst other factors, the fact three judges need to be temporarily discharged from their other duties, the amount of witnesses that are often made to testify, and therefore the long time an assizes trial can last (some high-profile ones can even last for months). This results in the fact that most of the assizes trials held, involve a homicide (murder or manslaughter) or other crimes of a grave nature. In this capacity, some extraordinary crimes against international law, such as genocide or crimes against humanity, are also tried by the courts of assizes.  Political and press crimes  Aside from the most serious crimes, article 150 of the Belgian Constitution also establishes that political crimes and press crimes (except those inspired by racism or xenophobia) have to be tried by a jury. As a result, the courts of assizes have exclusive jurisdiction over these types of crimes. In addition, article 148 of the Belgian Constitution establishes that trials of political and press crimes are held in open court, unless the court and all parties involved agree to hold the trial behind closed doors. However, neither the Constitution or the law provides for a definition of what constitutes a political crime or press crime. As a result, the scope of these terms has historically been interpreted rather restrictively by Belgian courts. Through precedent and legal theory, political crimes can be defined as crimes that, by their intention and their effect, constitute a direct attack on the functioning of the institutions of the state. In the same way, press crimes can be defined as the expression, in print or by similar means, of an idea or opinion that breaches the law, as long as the print in question is effectively published.  Procedure  Courtroom sketch of a trial before the court of assizes of Brussels (1843).  Indictment  Unlike for trials before the police tribunals and tribunals of first instance, no-one may be prosecuted before a court of assizes without a prior indictment (, , ) by the chamber of indictment of the court of appeal. This indictment can be obtained after a judicial investigation conducted by an investigative judge of the tribunal of first instance. Such judicial investigations are overseen by the council chamber, which is chaired by another judge of the tribunal of first instance. If the council chamber decides at the end of such a judicial investigation that there are sufficient indications of guilt of a crime that should not be correctionalised (see earlier), it will send the case to the chamber of indictment, which is chaired by a panel of three counsellors of the court of appeal. If the chamber of indictment decides as well that there exist sufficient indications of guilt, and that the suspected crime should not be correctionalised, it will deliver an indictment for an assizes trial. The decision made by the chamber of indictment in this capacity is final except for an appeal in cassation. A court of assizes will then be assembled to hold the trial, except when in the case of cassation proceedings the Court of Cassation quashes the indictment. Once the decision is made to hold an assizes trial, the prosecutor-general (, , ) or his delegate who will prosecute the accused, is required to draw up an act of accusation (, , ), which describes the criminal charges brought against the accused. The accused's defense may also draw up an act of defense (, , ) as a response to the act of accusation, but this is not required.  Preliminary hearing  Before the start of the assizes trial, the presiding judge holds a preliminary hearing with the accused and the civil parties (or their counsel). During this preliminary hearing, the presiding judge will decide on the witnesses that will testify during the trial, and in which order and on which date their testimony will be scheduled. The prosecution, the accused, and any civil party may propose witnesses to be heard. They will either testify as to facts and guilt, either as to the morality and character of the accused, or as to both. Experts who were involved in the pre-trial investigation (such as medical examiners or forensic psychiatrists) may be called upon as expert witnesses in order to clarify their findings. The presiding judge may object to any proposed witness if their testimony appears to be trivial and useless to the trial. In any case, the testimony of the police officers who made the first observations in the case, as well as that of the police officers who investigated the morality and the character of the accused, must always be heard. The witnesses agreed upon are legally obligated to testify and receive a summons as to when they have to do so.  Jury selection  At least twenty days before the start of the assizes trial, a list of no less than sixty potential jurors is compiled. All of these potential jurors will receive a summons for the jury selection, which will happen at least two business days before the start of the trial. At the beginning of the jury selection, the presiding judge removes any potential juror who does not (longer) meet the criteria to serve as juror, or who has a valid reason not to serve as one, from the list. Out of the remaining potential jurors, twelve are then selected at random who will effectively serve. Additionally, up to twelve alternate jurors may be selected as well, depending on the nature of the case and how long the trial is expected to last. The prosecution, the accused and the civil parties (or their counsel) all have the right of peremptory challenge; they each may object to half the number of (effective and alternate) jurors at most, without giving a reason for their objection. The presiding judge may only object to a juror in order to ensure there are at least four men and four women on the jury. The selected jurors are definitively impaneled after swearing an oath. Before the start of the actual trial, the jurors attend an information session informing them of the conduct of the trial and their rights and duties as jurors.  Trial hearings  The actual trial is held orally, due to the jurors not having access to the documents and reports resulting from the pre-trial investigation. During the hearings, the jurors are permitted to take notes. They have the duty to be attentive and impartial; if they appear to be inattentive or partial, they can be removed from the trial and replaced by an alternate juror. They also have the duty to refrain from any contact with outsiders and the news media, and not allow themselves to be influenced by any outside pressure. The presiding judge enjoys an important discretionary power during the trial to order any additional investigative measure he considers necessary to bring the truth to light (which is a feature of the Belgian judicial system in general). In this capacity, the presiding judge has to act both √† charge and √† d√©charge, which means they have to faithfully examine and consider all elements to the benefit and to the detriment of the accused. Such legal systems, where judges are actively involved in truth finding, are often referred to as inquisitorial systems. * Reading of the acts of accusation and defense: the trial begins with the prosecutor-general or his delegate reading the act of accusation for the court and jury, describing the criminal charges brought against the accused. Then the accused's defense may read its act of defense (if they have prepared one). The jurors receive a copy of both acts. * Investigation at the hearing: after the reading of both acts, the entire pre- trial investigation is gone over during the hearings, which involves the examination of all witnesses and evidence. This is often referred to as the 'investigation at the hearing' (, , ). The first step in the investigation at the hearing is the presiding judge questioning the accused on the charges brought against him or her. The next step is that the testimony of all witnesses are heard in the order established during the preliminary hearing. Before being questioned, the witnesses swear an oath \\"to speak the whole truth and nothing but the truth\\"; they are required to speak the truth under penalty of perjury. However, family members of the accused are exempt from testifying under oath. The witnesses are first questioned by the presiding judge. Then the prosecution, the defense and the civil parties may question the witnesses, regardless of which party proposed the witness. This step involves direct examination as well as cross-examination. Unlike some other legal systems, there are little rules about which questions can and cannot be posed to witnesses (for example regarding hearsay). The jurors may pose questions to the witnesses as well through the presiding judge, as long as these are not partial. During the trial, the presiding judge may decide to summon any additional witness, who was not stipulated during the preliminary hearing, to testify. In some high-profile cases, hundreds of witnesses are sometimes summoned, and the time necessary for all of them to testify can take weeks. * Pleas: after the investigation at the hearing is finished (meaning all witnesses have been heard and all evidence is examined), all parties get to make their case. First the civil parties and the prosecution hold their pleadings, and then the defense, during which they bring forth their arguments regarding the facts and guilt, and any peculiar circumstance (either extenuating or aggravating). They all get the opportunity to reply to each others pleadings as well. The accused or his defense counsel always has the last word. * Questions to the jury: the presiding judge will then formulate the questions of fact the jury has to answer. These questions are always yes- no questions and are formulated along the lines of \\"is the accused guilty of crime X?\\" and \\"did the accused commit the crime under circumstance Y?\\" They follow from the criminal charges described in the act of accusation and any extenuating or aggravating circumstance discovered during the trial hearings and pleadings. Finally, the presiding judge instructs the jury on the conduct of the deliberation, and reminds the jurors of their duties and that they may only declare the accused guilty if his or her guilt is established beyond any reasonable doubt.  Jury deliberation on facts  The twelve jurors deliberate on the questions of fact posed together with the three judges in their deliberation room. They are not permitted to leave the room or to come in contact with outsiders before their verdict is rendered. At the end of the jury deliberation, the twelve jurors vote on all the questions posed to them through a secret ballot. The three judges do not have a vote over the questions posed to the jury. The jurors must only answer 'yes' if the guilt of the accused on the question posed is proven beyond any reasonable doubt. Ballots left blank are counted in favour of the accused (as a 'no'). If only six jurors (being half of the jury) or less vote 'yes', the accused is acquitted. If at least eight jurors (a qualified majority) vote 'yes', the accused is found guilty. In case the accused is only found guilty by a simple majority of the jurors (meaning seven voted 'yes' and five 'no'), the three judges decide on the question. The accused is found guilty if a majority of the judges (two of three) considers the accused guilty as well, otherwise the accused is acquitted on that question. Since there is no unanimity requirement, hung juries are not a possibility. After all questions posed have been answered this way, the jurors and judges draw up the motivation for the verdict, which must contain the main reasons as to why the accused is found guilty. In case the accused is found guilty, the three judges may declare a mistrial if all three of them agree the jurors are sorely mistaken either as to questions of fact or questions of law, as discovered during the drawing up of the motivation. This will result in the case being suspended and subjected to a new trial by three new judges and a new jury. After the verdict of the jury and the motivation are drawn up, they are pronounced in court by the presiding judge in the presence of the accused. If the accused is acquitted on the charges brought against him, the presiding judge orders his release. He cannot be retried on the charges the jury has acquitted him of. If the accused is found guilty, the sentencing hearings will immediately begin after the guilty verdict.  Sentencing  After a guilty verdict, the court will dismiss the charges if the law does not allow for a penalty to be imposed on the accused, such as when the statute of limitations has expired. If not the case, pleadings are held on the penalty to impose. The prosecution first brings forth its arguments regarding the penalty to impose, after which the accused's defense gets to bring forth its arguments. The defense may no longer contest the facts of which the accused has been found guilty by the jury. The civil parties have no say regarding the penalty. When the prosecution and defense have held their pleadings regarding the penalty, the judges and jurors will again retreat to their deliberation room. Contrary to the deliberation on the questions of fact, all of the three judges and twelve jurors have an equal vote over the penalty, and the vote is held orally instead of by a secret ballot. The penalty to be imposed needs to be provided for by law and to be agreed upon by a simple majority. If no majority for a certain penalty exists, the judges or jurors that supported the least favourable penalty to the accused are required to support one of the other proposed penalties, until one of the proposed penalties gains majority support. The judges and jurors then decide by a simple majority on the motivation for the penalty, which must mention the provisions of the law on which it is based. The sentence and its motivation are pronounced by the presiding judge in open court in the presence of the now convict. After pronouncing the sentence, the presiding judge informs the convict of the possibility of an appeal in cassation, and discharges the jurors of their duty which has been fulfilled.  Civil action  It is a feature of the Belgian judicial system in general, that the courts and tribunals which have jurisdiction over criminal cases, will also decide on any civil damages sought by a victim who is a civil party to the case. However, any civil action will only be heard after the accused is sentenced. Regarding the courts of assizes, only the three judges will decide on a civil action without the jury. The civil parties may first make their demands, and the defense may then argue there is no cause for damages or the damages sought by the civil parties are too high. The defense may not contest the facts for which the convict has been sentenced. The court will then render a civil judgement.  Appeal in cassation  The judgements made by the courts of assizes are final as to questions of fact. Only an appeal in cassation on questions of law to the Court of Cassation, the supreme court in the judicial system of Belgium, is still possible. Such an appeal to the Court of Cassation is extraordinary procedure, and will result in the Court of Cassation either upholding or either quashing the contested judgement of the court of assizes. If the Court of Cassation does the latter, it will refer the case to a different court of assizes than were the case originated from, to be tried de novo (both on questions of fact and questions of law).  Statistics  According to the statistics provided by the College of the courts and tribunals of Belgium, a judgement was rendered in 73 assizes trials in 2016. Due to a change in Belgian law which expanded the number of cases open to correctionalisation (which allows for crimes to be tried by the tribunals of first instance instead of the courts of assizes), the number of judgements rendered in assizes trials dropped to 30 in 2017.

Active clearance control (ACC) is a method used in gas turbines to improve fuel efficiency. This is achieved by dynamically controlling the turbine tip clearance. During normal cruise flight, the engine is exposed to many loads such as intense heat and centrifugal force. This causes expansion of certain components and alters the gap between the turbine casing and tips of the spinning turbine blades. The amount of air leaking around, past the edge of the blades without passing through them is critical to engine performance and fuel efficiency. For this reason since the late 1960s, blade tip sealing has taken on a prominent role in aircraft engine design. The ACC system dynamically controls the high pressure turbine (HPT) blade clearance. This can be achieved in numerous ways.  Background  HPT (high pressure turbine) blade tip clearance has a significant impact on fuel burn and emissions. Blade tip sealing has been a challenging problem since the development of the gas turbine engine. It is such because the clearance between the blade tips and surrounding casing (shroud) tends to vary due primarily to changes in thermal and mechanical loads on the rotating (turbine wheel) and stationary (stator, turbine casing) structures. Using ACC gives significant benefits in cruise fuel burn, range, and payload capability for long range aircraft.  Basic system overview  One common active clearance control consists of the ACC valve which mixes hot and cold air from the compressor exit and the bypass duct, respectively, to a desired temperature. The air is routed to flow through tubes surrounding the casing at each turbine stage. This air expands or contracts the turbine case and in doing so, it maintains the accurate clearance between the turbine case and the blade tip. This clearance should be maintained accurately which is essential for the engine efficiency and its performance. The ACC valve opening is adjusted automatically by the FADEC system depending on the thrust lever position.  Categories  HPT clearance control systems can be categorized as passive and active, active being controlled via a hydro-mechanical control or via FADEC (full authority digital engine control). The systems can be further classified as either thermal or mechanical.

It was built in 1788, as the National Register reports, and has been expanded several times since. Until recently it was the oldest continuously operated grist mill in the state. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Around that time it began producing kosher flour for use in baking matzoh. In 2007, its present owners began converting it into a restaurant TuthillHouse at the Mill opening in August, 2010. Property The mill property is located at the end of Tuthilltown Road, which follows the west bank of the Shawangunk for a short distance from Albany Post Road just south of its intersection with US 44/NY 55. The stream is to its east, with the neighboring area being a combination of woodlots and fields, and directly adjacent to the first Whiskey Distillery in New York since Prohibition. Tuthilltown Spirits previously owned the Grist Mill, and carries its name. The Erenzo family and Tuthilltown Distillery has recently assumed management responsibilities for the restaurant. Sale of the Grist Mill back to the Erenzo family, is in process and should be completed by September 2014. This will once again return the Tuthilltown property to its full historic size, incorporating the Distillery, the Mill, the Mill race, the dam, and the main house back into one property There are a few other houses on the street. There are several outbuildings on the property. Most are of more recent construction or, if historic, have been modified extensively and no longer retain their historic integrity. The National Register listing includes two contributing properties besides the mill: its dam further up the Shawangunk and the right-of-way around the mill race between it and the main mill building. The main building is a three-story frame structure on a fieldstone foundation. Its gabled roof has a clerestory monitor. Asbestos siding covers the original clapboard. A shed-roofed one-story addition to the south houses the mill store. Inside most of the original finishes and layout remain. Four runs of millstones are on the first floor, powered by a Leffel turbine. A concrete headrace delivers water to the turbine pit.

The settlement that sprung up around it was the Town of Gardiner's commercial hub until the construction of the Wallkill Valley Railroad spurred the development of the hamlet of Gardiner. Its original power source was an undershot wheel, later replaced by an overshot wheel. Between 1880 and 1910 much of its modern grinding technology, such as the vertical-shaft turbine drive system, was installed. In 1943 the addition was built, and another addition was incorporated into the mill building as its garage.

It is also used for official royal receptions, and interparliamentary conferences. History The Ridderzaal seen as it was before World War I In the 13th century Floris IV, Count of Holland bought a piece of land next to a small lake to build a house on. The Ridderzaal, the manorial hall of Floris V, grandson of Floris IV, was built on this estate in the 13th century. Over the centuries, the government buildings developed around this lake and incorporated the Ridderzaal. From the early 17th century, the Ridderzaal became an important trading place for booksellers, as Westminster Hall was in London. In later centuries it served a variety of purposes - as a market hall, a promenade, a drill hall, a public record office, a hospital ward, even the offices of the state lottery. It was restored between 1898 and 1904 to serve its present purposes. The Ridderzaal was also the venue for the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference in 1949.

The red flowers, which have a distinctive long and curving keel, usually appear between August and November in Australia (late winter to late spring). The ovate leaves are glossy green above and silvery below. The species was first formally described by botanist Charles Lemaire in 1844 and published in Horticulteur Francais as Brachysema lanceolatum. In 2002 botanists Gregory Chandler and Michael Crisp reassigned the species to the genus Gastrolobium along with other Brachysema species and gave it the current name. The variety B. l. var. glabrescens Meisn. was made a species in its own right and named Gastrolobium bracteolosum (Crisp) G.Chandler & Crisp. Gastrolobium celsianum occurs in the south-west of the state, usually on sandy or gravelly soils along watercourses and also within mallee and woodland where it is found on flats or in moist depressions. The species has been popular in cultivation for many years. It is tolerant of a wide range of soils but requires good drainage. Although performing best in full sun, it will tolerate light shade.

Arden is directly north of the Broad Ripple Village neighborhood and south of the community of Meridian Hills. Arden sits on acreage which was originally part of the Walter Johnson farm. In 1910, were sold by the Johnsons to the Van Sants for their family estate. In 1922, the Van Sants platted a small subdivision on and the Johnsons platted a larger subdivision on of their farm. Both subdivisions failed and resulted in only a single house being built in 1927. Both subdivisions were vacated the following year. In 1929, were purchased from the Johnsons by the Arden Realty Group which subdivided the property. The first home in the Arden development was constructed in 1929, but construction ceased during the Depression. In 1931, a new show home was built and in a couple of years construction resumed in the Arden subdivision. Most homes were constructed during the neighborhood's first twenty years; however, there have been a handful of homes constructed more recently.

It was first issued in 1978 on Ricordi and then re-released by BMG. The songs were written by Fabrizio De Andr√© and Massimo Bubola. Two of them are De Andr√©'s first forays into overtly political themes, which will be a recurring subject of his in later years. The album is also the only one in De Andr√©'s output to include two fully instrumental tracks with no lyrics and no vocals. (The 2011 tribute album Sogno n¬∞ 1 does include an instrumental track, but it is a re-recorded version of a piece originally recorded with spoken-word lyrics.) Track listing # \\"Rimini\\" (4:08) # \\"Volta la carta\\" (3:49) # \\"Coda di lupo\\" (5:24) # \\"Andrea\\" (5:31) # \\"Tema di Rimini\\" (1:52) # \\"Avventura a Durango\\" (4:51) #\\"Sally\\" (4:49) #\\"Zirichiltaggia\\" (2:18) # \\"Parlando del naufragio della London Valour\\" (4:41) # \\"Folaghe\\" (2:58) All songs were written by Fabrizio De Andr√© and Massimo Bubola, except for \\"Avventura a Durango\\", based on the music of \\"Romance in Durango\\", by Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy. The songs *\\"Rimini\\" is a soft, drumless ballad in , including a string orchestra and a choir. Its lyrics paint an ironical portrait of a waitress working at a bar in Rimini, who was shamed for having an illicit affair with a lifeguard, only to have an abortion later on. She is first described in a fantasy setting (a pirate's daughter, who sailed with Christopher Columbus) and then as she really is (a grocer's daughter working as a waitress). *\\"Volta la carta\\" (\\"Turn the card\\") uses a musical framework inspired by an Irish jig with the metrical structure and imagery of a popular Italian rhyme, to tell the story of a young girl named Angiolina, who, after a short engagement to a carabiniere, goes through a romantic fling with a foreign, possibly military, aircraft pilot. According to a statement by co- writer Bubola within the eighth and last DVD (Poesia in forma di canzone - \\"Poetry as songs\\") of the 8-DVD documentary series Dentro Faber [\\"Inside Faber\\", about De Andr√©'s life and career], released in 2011, the line \\"the foreign boy's got an orchestral record which spins fast and talks about love\\" is intended as a dig at James Last, whose over-sentimentalized orchestral renditions of classical pieces and pop songs were becoming popular in Italy towards the end of the Seventies, after having been huge hits all across Europe. Like other singer-songwriters from the era, De Andr√© and Bubola strongly disliked Last.As told by Bubola in Dentro Faber, DVD 8. *\\"Coda di lupo\\" (\\"Wolf's Tail\\") is about an imaginary Native American boy, whose life story is used as a pretext to describe the conflict between extreme left-wing political movements in Italy and the Italian Communist party, the largest in Europe, which resulted in the failure of the former and the dissolution of the Red Brigades at the end of the Seventies. The same theme is explored again in the album's penultimate track. *\\"Andrea\\" (a male name in Italian) is a folk ballad about a gay soldier whose lover, a curly dark-haired young man, was killed in Trento during World War II. By the end of the song, which is set to a passionately melodic, Mediterranean tune, Andrea is contemplating suicide by throwing himself into a deep well. However, the story is not finished in the song, whose final lines have Andrea wondering whether the well is \\"deeper than [him]self\\".Original Italian lyrics: \\"Lui disse: [...] mi basta che sia / pi√π profondo di me\\". When introducing the song in live performances, De Andr√© jokingly commented about the poetical aspect of the name given by Plato to homosexual people, i.e. \\"children of the Moon\\". *\\"Tema di Rimini\\" (\\"Rimini Theme\\") is an orchestral segue from \\"Andrea\\", which reprises the musical theme from \\"Rimini\\" with a different tempo and time signature. *\\"Avventura a Durango\\" is, as stated above, a translation of Bob Dylan's \\"Romance in Durango\\", from his 1976 album Desire, about a killer trying to escape to Durango with his wife Magdalena [Margarita in the original lyrics] - only to be killed himself in the end by a sniper. De Andr√© and Bubola sing the chorus in Neapolitan, substituting Dylan's South American Spanish lines. *\\"Sally\\" is a melodic ballad in with a prominent instrumental interlude played on an accordion, about a child's fear of the unknown while simultaneously being attracted by it, a theme which De Andr√© will explore further in later songs. *\\"Zirichiltaggia\\" is De Andr√©'s first-ever song not in Italian. A very fast country/bluegrass number written entirely in Gallurese, it consists in a comical quarrel between two Sardinian shepherds (both performed by De Andr√©, using vari-speed and other effects to sound like two different people) over an inheritance dispute, which, according to Bubola's later recollections, De Andr√© actually witnessed at the time. Its title translates literally into \\"Lizards' den\\" but it is not in the lyrics, which however do feature the word zirichelti, i.e. lizards. *\\"Parlando del naufragio della London Valour\\" (\\"Talking [about] the sinking of the London Valour\\") is about a shipwreck in April 1970 when a gale drove a British cargo ship, , onto the harbour mole at Genoa with the loss of 20 lives. However, De Andr√© refrains from recounting the actual shipwreck and instead uses it as a metaphor for the \\"normalization\\" process within Italy in 1977-'78, caused by the failure of armed protest groups, especially the Red Brigades, after the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro. The lyrics also include cynical portraits of various characters, who may or may not be identified with actual people. https://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?lang=it&id;=4719 - An analysiss of the lyrics (in Italian and English) The same drastic changes in Italian ideologies would also be the main subject of a later song, \\"La domenica delle salme\\" [i.e. \\"Corpses Sunday\\", with a pun on Palm Sunday], within the 1990 album Le Nuvole. * \\"Folaghe\\" (\\"Coots\\"), the album closer, is a quiet instrumental led by a twang guitar, intended to represent the placid motion of coots on a lake.

Her father, Pierre-Joseph de Gamond, was governor of the province of Antwerp at the time of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and a lawyer and professor after 1830 in the independent Kingdom of Belgium.Alphonse Wauters, \\"Gamond (Zo√©-Charlotte de)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 7 (Brussels, 1883), 474‚Äì481.

Puissant (Brussels, √âditions Racine, 2006). Originally, together with her friend Julie du Bosch, a partisan of Saint-Simon, she later abandoned his ideas for those of the utopian socialist Charles Fourier. In the early 1830s she was active in supporting Italian and Polish political exiles. It was at this time that she met Polish nationalist Jan Czy≈Ñski, with whom she wrote Le Roi des Paysans. She also produced writings on feminism in the mid-1830s. On 18 March 1835 she married the Italian artist Jean-Baptiste Gatti, thereafter often using the name \\"Gatti de Gamond\\". In the late 1830s the Gattis left Brussels for Paris, where Zo√© wrote a successful work, reprinted five times and translated into English, on Fourier's philosophy. With the support of two wealthy English Fourierists, the Gattis established a phalanst√®re at C√Æteaux in 1842. This proved to be a financial disaster for them, and they returned to Brussels and a life of relative poverty. In the 1840s, Zo√© wrote two novels, Fi√®vres de l'√¢me (1844) and Le Monde enviable (1846), as well as an overview of biblical history for use in schools, Abr√©g√© de l'histoire sainte (1848). On 21 June 1847, Zo√© was appointed inspector of girls' schools for the city of Brussels.Robert O.J. Van Nuffel, \\"Gatti de Gamond (Zo√©-Charlotte)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 38 (Brussels, 1973), 241‚Äì250. She published several educational manuals, along with a guide to running a nursery school. She died in 1854, aged only 48, leaving two young daughters who also went on to become educationalists, Marie and Isabelle, the latter also a noted Belgian feminist.

The magazine was soft core, and distributed to mainstream news outlets, and to the soft core sections of adult stores. It was available in all Ruben Sturmen influenced outlets, probably due to the Flynt Distributing connection. It was distributed by Flynt Distributing, of the Larry Flynt empire. The magazine was an attempt to do a gay version of Hustler magazine. Its first editions featured all color photography with very high production values similar in style to Hustler. It also regularly featured male models with erections and exposed anuses, which set this magazine apart from competitors when it first appeared. It was published in a 10-issue per calendar year format, to accommodate the Flynt Distributing model, which put the current month publication on the stands with a next month date. After 2000, the focus was on top-line male porn models from Bel Ami, Falcon and other adult-video production companies. Other items, such as calendars, were also published using the same label. The magazine contained nude male photography, erotic fiction, video reviews and other gay adult features. The magazine specialized in young but not solely twinkish men, primarily age 18 to 25 but some to age 30.

Literary significance and criticism Regarded in the Christian world as something of a classic, it is often quoted. :\\"In The Mind of the Maker, one of her most profound works, Sayers contends that the creative process in art works in ways that correspond to the dynamic relation among the three Persons of the Trinity in Christian theology ‚Äî and that the activity of one illuminates the activity of the other.\\" Surprisingly well received, Sayers' work even finds readers beyond the religious world, such as in the software management book The Mythical Man-Month. :\\"Dorothy Sayers, in her excellent book, The Mind of the Maker, divides creative activity into three stages: the idea, the implementation, and the interaction. A book, then, or a computer, or a program comes into existence first as an ideal construct, built outside time and space, but complete in the mind of the author. It is realized in time and space, by pen, ink, and paper, or by wire, silicon, and ferrite. The creation is complete when someone reads the book, uses the computer, or runs the program, thereby interacting with the mind of the maker. This description, which Miss Sayers uses to illuminate not only human creative activity but also the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, will help us in our present task.

She was one of the Weymouth sub-class of the Town class. The ship survived the First World War and was sold for scrap in 1930. Construction and design Dartmouth was laid down by Vickers at their Barrow shipyard on 19 February 1910, one of four Town-class protected cruisers ordered under the 1909‚Äì1910 Naval Estimates. The four 1909‚Äì10 ships, also known as the Weymouth class, were an improved version of five similar Town-class ships laid down under the 1908‚Äì1909 Estimates, known as the Bristol class, with a heavier main armament of eight 6 inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns, compared with the two 6 inch and ten 4 inch of the earlier ships.Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 52.Brown 2010, pp. 63‚Äì64. The ships had a secondary armament of four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) guns, with two submerged 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes mounted on the ships' beams.Lyon Warship Vol. 1 No. 2, p. 57. Dartmouth was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normal and deep load. Machinery was the same as in the Bristol class, with 12 Yarrow boilers feeding Parsons steam turbines, driving four shafts. The turbines were laid out in three separate engine rooms, with high pressure turbines, located in wing compartments, driving the outer shafts and low pressure turbines in a central compartment. The engines were rated at , giving a design speed of . The ship had four funnels.The Engineer 17 February 1911, p. 174.

Service history On commissioning, Dartmouth joined the Atlantic Fleet, being attached to the Third Battle Squadron from 1912 to 1913. After a 1913 cruise to the Mediterranean Sea, she was briefly attached to the Second Light Cruiser Squadron at Devonport to participate in the 1913 Naval Manoeuvres before leaving to join the East Indies Squadron of the Eastern Fleet. On the outbreak of the First World War, Dartmouth was docked at Bombay, but was soon returned to sea, escorting a troop convoy from Karachi to Mombasa in Kenya and then taking part in the search for the German cruiser . On 9 October that year she captured the German tug Adjutant in the Mozambique Channel. On 30 October, the cruiser spotted K√∂nigsberg moored up the Rufiji delta, and on 2 November, Dartmouth attempted to engage K√∂nigsberg or the supporting steamer Somali but the German ships were too far upstream to be successfully engaged.The Naval Review Vol. 3 No. 3, pp. 481‚Äì483. On 10 November, the British scuttled the collier Newbridge in the Rufiji River as a blockship to prevent K√∂nigsberg from escaping, and on 11 November, Dartmouth left to reinforce the Cape of Good Hope Station in the aftermath of the Battle of Coronel.The Naval Review Vol. 3 No. 3, pp. 485‚Äì486. In January 1915, Dartmouth was reassigned to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet but was detached to operate in the South Atlantic in the search for the commerce raider . (Unknown to the Royal Navy, Karlsruhe had already been lost, sunk by an internal explosion on 4 November 1914 near Barbados.)Massie 2007, p. 286. In February 1915, Dartmouth was sent to join the forces operating off the Dardanelles in support of the Gallipoli Campaign. On 15 March she suffered a boiler explosion that killed 15 of her crew. Despite this damage, Dartmouth continued operations, and on 18 March Dartmouth patrolled off the West coast of the Gallipoli peninsula while a final attempt was made by the battleships of the fleet to force the straits during daylight. The attack was a failure, with three battleships sunk by mines, and several more ships heavily damages by mines or by Turkish gunfire. Dartmouth escorted the battlecruiser , badly damaged by striking a mine, to Tenedos. On 25 April, the Allies landed troops at Anzac Cove and Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula, with Dartmouth taking part in a diversionary simulated landing further north, at Bulair. In May 1915, Dartmouth was reassigned to the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron at Brindisi, supporting Italian forces in the Adriatic Sea.Halpern 2004, pp. 15‚Äì17. Dartmouths speed had been reduced to by the boiler explosion in March,Naval Staff Monograph No. 21, p. 144. and further boiler problems had reduced her speed to by June 1915.Naval Staff Monograph No. 21, p. 152.

Dartmouth was hit several times by shellfire from Austro-Hungarian cruisers which she was pursuing, and had to heave to. Returning to port she was hit by a torpedo from the German submarine and began sinking. The order to abandon ship was given but a small team volunteered to remain on board manning the pumps while the Dartmouth was towed to port. Dartmouth was drydocked and repaired and went on to survive the war. She was sold for scrapping on 13 December 1930 to Alloa Ship Breaking Company of Rosyth.Lyon Warship Vol. 1 No. 3, p. 51.

A listing or program listing is a printed list of lines of computer code or digital data (in human-readable form).  Use cases  Listings are commonly used in education and computer-related books to show examples of code. In the early days of programming, it was used to hand-check a program and as permanent storage. It was also common in 1970s and 1980s computer enthusiast magazines (for instance Creative Computing) and books like BASIC Computer Games for type-in programs. Today, hard copy listings are seldom used because display screens can present more lines than formerly, programs tend to be modular, storage in soft copy is considered preferable to hard copy, and digital material is easily transmitted via networks, or on disks or tapes. Furthermore, data sets tend to be too large to be conveniently put on paper, and they are more easily searched in soft-copy form. Assembly-code listings are occasionally analysed by programmers who want to understand how a compiler is translating their source code into assembly language. For example, the GNU C Compiler (gcc) will produce an assembly code listing if it is invoked with the command-line option -S.Options Controlling the Kind of Output, in the GCC 4.9.1 Manual, https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.1/gcc/Overall- Options.html#Overall-Options Listings of computer programs are still important in US patent law.

Some stock exchanges allow shares of a foreign company to be listed and may allow dual listing, subject to conditions. Normally the issuing company is the one that applies for a listing but in some countries an exchange can list a company, for instance because its stock is already being traded via informal channels. Stocks whose market value and/or turnover fall below critical levels may be delisted by the exchange. Delisting often arises from a merger or takeover, or the company going private. Requirements Each stock exchange has its own listing requirements or rules. Initial listing requirements usually include supplying a history of a few years of financial statements (not required for \\"alternative\\" markets targeting young firms); a sufficient size of the amount being placed among the general public (the free float), both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the total outstanding stock; an approved prospectus, usually including opinions from independent assessors, and so on. Examples The listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include: * New York Stock Exchange: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years. * NASDAQ Stock Exchange: NASDAQ requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years. * London Stock Exchange: the main market of the London Stock Exchange requires a minimum market capitalization (¬£700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient working capital for at least 12 months from the date of listing. * Bombay Stock Exchange: Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of and minimum public float equivalent to . Delisting Delisting refers to the practice of removing the stock of a company from a stock exchange so that investors can no longer trade shares of the stock on that exchange. This typically occurs when a company goes out of business, declares bankruptcy, no longer satisfies the listing rules of the stock exchange, or has become a private company after a merger or acquisition, or wants to reduce regulatory reporting complexities and overhead, or if the stock volumes on the exchange from which it wishes to delist are not significant. Delisting does not necessarily mean a change in company's core strategy.Allianz to delist from NYSE and European Exchanges In the United States, securities which have been delisted from a major exchange for reasons other than going private or liquidating may be traded on over-the- counter markets like the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets.

This segment of the native population had become assimilated into the former White society of Spanish Guinea which primarily existed along the coastline communities of the continental part of the country, as well as on the islands of Bioko and Annabon.  Population specifics  This population included: * Full-blooded descendants of local/regional native tribes that had assimilated to the Whites after receiving a Christian Spanish education. * Descendants of freed Cuban slaves who, despite being free to return to Cuba, remained in the country, marrying into the local population. These former slaves were brought to Africa by the Royal Orders of September 13, 1845 (by way of voluntary arrangement) and a June 20, 1861 deportation from Cuba, due to the lack of volunteers. Many were of European and/or Amerindian ancestry. * Mulattoes born to Equatorial Guinean mothers and white Spanish fathers, some unacknowledged by their fathers.Espacio, Tiempo y Forma, Serie V, H¬™ Contempor√°nea, t. 11, 1998, p√°gs. 113-138, Penolog√≠a e indigenismo en la antigua Guinea espa√±ola , Pedro Mar√≠a Belmonte Medina Offspring resulting from unions of consent between African women and European men had become a social trend around the mid 1900s in Equatorial Guinea, as well as other parts of West Africa.  Society  Emancipados were socially and culturally mixed. Many were part of the native tribal landscape, and most others contributed to the once-thriving intellectual community that resulted from having access to Christian and European education. Their education helped propel Spanish Guinea as having the highest literacy rate of all African countries in the mid-1900s. The once- thriving community also contributed to the wealth of Spanish Guinea, which was once the third wealthiest African country before its independence from Spain.  Exodus  Due to political dissension surrounding the Equatorial Guinean independence from Spain in 1968, many Emancipados relocated to Europe after being met with anti-European sentiments and counter political pressures from the incoming regime. Subsequently, this led to the slaughter of some within this population. Many Emancipados relocated to Spain (the Canary Islands), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and Cape Verde.

Despite the name, the cemetery is three-quarters of a mile from Hampstead Village, and bears a different postcode. It is jointly managed by Islington and Camden Cemetery Service and opens seven days a week, with closing times varying throughout the year. Location and history One of the Neogothic chapels and the central porte-coch√®re Hampstead Cemetery is situated on Fortune Green Road and is bordered on the northern side by the sports ground of University College School. A public footpath running from Hocroft Road to Fortune Green runs through the cemetery, effectively splitting it in two. Hampstead Cemetery was consecrated by the Bishop of London and opened in November 1876. The entire site covers , and an estimated 60,000 people are buried there. While there are no new grave spaces available, there is an area for cremated remains to the north of the cemetery, by the Fortune Green Road exit. The cemetery has a pair of Gothic style mortuary chapels, both of which are Grade II listed buildings. The southern chapel was originally Anglican, and the northern non-conformist; they share a common porte-coch√®re. Currently, only the southern chapel is in use as an inter-faith place of worship. There is also an entry lodge made of Kentish Rag and Bath stone. The Heritage Lottery Fund has funded restoration work on the buildings. A large number of Celtic crosses can be found in the area to the southwest of the chapel, marking the presence of several Scottish families. The northeastern corner has some notable examples of modern and Art Deco stonemasonry, in particular the Bianchi monument and the sculpted church organ in memory of Charles Barritt.

The most prominent feature of the grave - a stylised sculpture of a female angel raising her hands to heaven - has become famous in its own right, and often adorns the covers of local guidebooks. Similarly, the tomb of James Wilson ('Wilson Pasha'), Chief Engineer to the Egyptian Government (1875-1901), executed in red marble and also found in the eastern section, has a striking Egyptian look to it. The monument built by the sculptor Sir William Goscombe John to his wife Marthe (d.1923) was stolen from the cemetery in 2001 but later returned after being spotted at an auction a few months later. It was then moved to East Finchley Cemetery but was once more stolen from a storage area in autumn 2006. It has not been recovered. Inscriptions The cemetery contains more than one grave with humorous or bizarre inscriptions. On the main avenue of the eastern section can be seen the grave of John Kensit (died 1902), a religious protestor who was \\"struck down by the missile of an assassin in Birkenhead\\", actually a chisel thrown by a member of a crowd he was preaching to (the man was charged with manslaughter but later acquitted). The following epitaph is carved on the tomb of Charles Cowper Ross, \\"a man of the theatre\\": > What will be said, > When I am dead, > Of what I used to do? > They liked my smile? > I failed with style? > Or, more than likely, \\"Who?\\" Flora and fauna The cemetery has a large number of mature ash trees. Other trees include yew, sycamore, Norway maple, silver birch, Lombardy poplar, purple cherry-plum, willow and Swedish whitebeam. There is a wildlife area in the north part of the eastern half of the cemetery. This has been planted with trees, shrubs and wild flowers especially attractive to wildlife, such as field maple, hazel, oak, oxeye daisy, common knapweed and bird's-foot-trefoil. This is where most of the site's butterflies are to be found, including small white, speckled wood, holly blue, meadow brown and small copper. Birds recorded in the cemetery include jay, robin redbreast, green woodpecker, long- tailed tit, goldcrest, willow warbler and linnet. It is also home to the ubiquitous grey squirrel, as well as many species of fungi.

He is currently the editorial cartoonist for the Herald Sun, a daily tabloid newspaper in Melbourne. Knight was also the last editorial cartoonist for one of the Herald Sun's joint predecessor newspapers, the afternoon broadsheet The Herald. Childhood Knight was born and raised in Sydney in 1962. He grew up in Lakemba, attended Wiley Park Primary School and then Narwee Boys' High School. He showed an early interest in drawing which was encouraged by his artistic father. Knight's first cartoons were of his family and their idiosyncrasies, drawn at family gatherings.Knight, Mark (2005). The Mark Knight Collection. Gspbooks, 6, 7. . When he was six years old, Knight's father bought him Paul Rigby's cartoon annual of 1967; Rigby's work influence his artwork for many years. He created scrapbooks of Rigby's cartoons cut from The Daily Telegraph, and studied and imitated them while developing his cartooning style. Knight started a cadetship in 1980 in the Fairfax art department, filling in the black squares in the crossword grids. He went to East Sydney Technical College and studied life drawing, painting, drawing and etching. Career Knight's 2018 cartoon of Serena Williams, which was internationally criticised as racist Knight worked as an editorial cartoonist for The Herald, and later for the Herald Sun after The Herald and The Sun were united in 1990. In 1999 Knight, alongside Bill Leak and other male political cartoonists, were criticised by the Labor Party's deputy leader, Jenny Macklin, who argued that cartoons such as those by Knight and Leak showing Meg Lees in sexual relations with John Howard were demeaning to women politicians.Robert Phiddian, Haydon R. Manning Comic Commentators: Contemporary Political Cartooning in Australia - 2008 - Page 125 \\"In June 1999, the Labor Party's deputy leader, Jenny Macklin, argued that cartoons such as the following two of Meg Lees ...

Knight created the children's character \\"Leuk the Duck\\" (derived from leukemia), a mascot for the Challenge cancer foundation which has subsequently been used in the organisation's educational material. Knight is also well-known for his Australian rules football imagery. After cartoonist William Ellis Green (\\"WEG\\") died in 2008, Knight took over his role as the Herald Sun's creator of Australian Football League (AFL) premiership posters and, because of this, has made media appearances on AFL shows, including designing alternate posters. For example, in 2017 on The Front Bar ahead of that year's grand final between Richmond and Adelaide, he unveiled a poster showing co-host and Richmond fan Mick Molloy wearing a Tiger onesie.Mark Knight's Mick Molloy Premiers Cartoon AFL on 7 on Twitter In September 2018, after tennis player Serena Williams was penalized for code violations during the 2018 US Open, Knight created a cartoon depicting Williams with exaggerated, masculine features and red lips reminiscent of racist caricatures of the 19th and 20th century. Knight was also criticized because Williams' opponent in the match was Naomi Osaka, a Japanese-Haitian, but Knight depicted Osaka instead as a blonde white woman. Knight and the Herald Sun defended the caricature as depicting Williams' behaviour and having nothing to do with race.Jai Bednall  Fox Sports, Newspaper doubles down with front page response to Serena Williams cartoon critics, https://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/us-open/us-savages-australias- ignorance-after-controversial-serena-williams-cartoon/news- story/7a154bd522a84d4d51cc9f1019daf679, 11 September 2018 Although Knight said he knew nothing of the Jim Crow period or drawings, the vilification of Black and indigenous people is not limited to the United States and has been criticized in Australian media. A day later, the Herald Sun reprinted the caricature depicting Williams on the front page with the headline \\"Welcome to PC World\\". Awards Knight won a Gold Quill Award from the Melbourne Press Club in 2005 for the best cartoon of the year. In 2001 he also picked up a Quill Award for Best Cartoon from the MPC. He was also named The Age Cartoonist of the Year at the 22nd annual Stan Cross Awards ceremony hosted by Rod Quantock in Ballarat, Victoria on 4 November 2007. His other accolades include awards in the categories Single Gag (2003) and Editorial (1995, 2006). In 2004, Knight was also presented with a Walkley Award for his cartoon named \\"Benefits of a Bedtime Story\\". In 2003, he received an award as part of the Australian Comedy Awards in the visual category for Outstanding Cartoonist as well as another Walkley Award.

He was the son of King Vakhtang VI of Kartli by his wife, Rusudan of Circassia. Vakhtang left him in charge of the government of Kartli (eastern Georgia) during his absence at the Safavid court of Persia from September 1716 to August 1719. His position was recognized by the Shah of Persia who invested him, in 1717, with the title of janishin, a crown, sword, gold insignia, and robe of honor. At the same time, he had to nominally embrace Islam and assumed the name of Shah-Nawaz. On this occasion, he was appointed by the Shah the commander-in-chief of the Persian army and governor- general of Azerbaijan. In 1722, he was appointed as commander of the √©lite gholam corps (qollar-aghasi). When the Ottoman armies invaded Georgia in 1723, Bakar attempted to negotiate, but eventually followed his father in a Russian exile in July 1724. He permanently settled in Moscow where he came to be known as Tsarevich Bakar Vakhtangovich Gruzinsky (). The prince engaged in cultural enterprises initiated by his father; he helped revive the Georgian printing house in Moscow and sponsored publication of The Bible in Georgian in 1743. Bakar was also involved in the Russian diplomatic and military service. In 1724, he was granted the village Lyskovo in hereditary possession. In November 1729, Bakar was promoted to lieutenant-general and appointed commander of artillery in the Moscow region. He died in Moscow in 1750 and was interred at the Donskoy Monastery. Family Bakar was married to Ana, daughter of Giorgi, Duke of Aragvi (1706 ‚Äì 18 February 1780), who accompanied him in Russia and died in Moscow, being buried in the Donskoy Monastery.

She was one of four ships of the Weymouth sub-class. The ship was initially assigned to the Atlantic Fleet upon completion in 1911, but was reduced to reserve in mid-1913. When the First World War began in 1914, Falmouth was transferred to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron (LCS) of the Grand Fleet and then the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron at the end of the year. The ship participated in most of the early fleet actions, including the Battles of Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank, and Jutland, but was only seriously engaged in the latter. She was torpedoed and sunk off Flamborough Head, Yorkshire by German submarines during the Action of 19 August 1916.

Two of these guns were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and two more were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast the bridge. The remaining four guns were positioned on the upper deck in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were also fitted. Their armament was completed by two submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.Lyon, Part 2, pp. 55‚Äì57 The Weymouth-class ships were considered protected cruisers, with an armoured deck providing protection for the ships' vitals. The armoured deck was thick over the magazines and machinery, over the steering gear and elsewhere. The conning tower was protected by 4 inches of armour, with the gun shields having armour, as did the ammunition hoists.Lyon, Part 2, p. 59 As the protective deck was at the waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly making them poor gun platforms.Brown, p. 63 One problem with the armour of the Weymouths which was shared with the other Town-class ships was the sizeable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap, and made the guns' crews vulnerable to leg injuries in combat.Lyon, Part 2, p. 57 Construction and career Falmouth was the ninth ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the eponymous port.Colledge, p. 122 The ship was laid down on 21 February 1910 by William Beardmore and Company at their Dalmuir shipyard and launched on 20 September. Upon completion in September 1911, Falmouth was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet and was transferred to the reserve 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Second Fleet at The Nore on 30 June 1913. By the end of the year, the ship had been transferred to the 5th Cruiser Squadron, also of the Second Fleet. On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, she was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. On 28 August 1914 she was present, but played no significant role, in the Battle of Heligoland Bight,Corbett, I, pp. 101‚Äì19 Several months later, the Germans bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December and the 1st LCS was escorting Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers in response when it encountered a German light cruiser and a half-flotilla of torpedo boats. Falmouth was not in range to engage before the squadron turned away to follow the battlecruisers.Massie, pp. 333‚Äì52 On 28 December, the ship was transferred to the 3rd LCS and became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier, the squadron commander. During the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, the squadron escorted the Grand Fleet, but was not engaged. After the battle was over, the squadron escorted the battlecruisers on their way back to Cromarty, Scotland.Transcript Battle of Jutland alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Almost a year later, Falmouth participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May‚Äì1 June 1916. As the battle began, the 3rd LCS was screening Beatty's battlecruisers as they searched for the German fleet and moved to support the 1st LCS after they had spotted the German ships. This put them out of position when Beatty turned south to pursue the German battlecruisers. After he turned north on encountering the main body of the German High Seas Fleet, Falmouth and her squadron were the first to encounter the screen of the Grand Fleet at 17:33. As Beatty turned east to rendezvous with them, the cruiser engaged several German ships at ranges below and in poor visibility. Falmouth opened fire on the disabled light cruiser beginning at about 18:15 and also fired a torpedo at her that missed around 18:21. She then briefly engaged two destroyers and then switched to the battlecruisers and , hitting both ships, also firing a torpedo that she mistakenly claimed to have hit around 18:25. In return, the ship was only hit once by a shell on the foremast that cut the voice tubes to the spotting top. By 18:40, the squadron was in position to escort the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet.Campbell, pp. 22, 31‚Äì33, 118, 150‚Äì51, 161, 196, 390 By 20:10, Beatty's ships were in front of the Grand Fleet and the 3rd LCS was screening them when Falmouth spotted five cruisers of the 4th Scouting Group and the squadron closed to engage at full speed. The British ships were not spotted in return until 20:17 and Falmouth opened fire a minute later at a range of . Despite poor visibility, she hit the light cruiser twice, one of which damaged her aft boilers and impaired her ability to keep steam up. By 20:38, the British lost sight of the Germans and turned away to assume their position at the head of Beatty's battlecruisers. The cruiser fired a total of 175 shells during the battle, the most of any British light cruiser.Campbell, pp. 250‚Äì52, 360 Action of 19 August 1916 On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland the following day, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. Part of the German plan was to draw the British ships through a series of submarine ambushes and Falmouth fell victim to one of the awaiting U-boats, , about 16:05 the following afternoon after the Grand Fleet was headed for home. Two torpedoes only badly damaged the cruiser, but follow-on attacks were unsuccessful due to the presence of the escorting destroyers. Shortly after she was struck, the armed trawler Cooksin went alongside and took off all of the men not required to work the ship. Falmouth was able to steam through the night under her own power at a speed of , although a pair of tugboats came out the following morning and took her in tow. Her course took her right past , which put another pair of torpedoes into her around noon, despite eight escorting destroyers.

The village has won many awards in Best Kept Village competitions and contains 27 entries in the Council's County Treasures database, 13 of which are listed buildings.  Location  The area of the community of Pendoylan, some , is situated between the A48 road and the M4 motorway in the Border Vale. It slopes down from an escarpment in the west, the site of Hensol Forest, and is bounded in the East by the River Ely. Tredodridge lies to the northwest. History The area is rich in history. There is evidence of prehistoric activity in two cooking mounds in the east and there is a motte with possible signs of a bailey in the north. The parish church, which is dedicated to St Cadoc (born circa 497), may well have been founded in his lifetime and there is a well named after him and one after St Teilo. The fertile land at Caerwigau was acquired by the Norman de Bonvils and in the twelfth century, were granted to the Knights Hospitallers who rented it out to the monks of Margham. They later acquired further land and erected a chapel in the 12th century. There is a well-preserved moat from a 13th- or 14th-century homestead at Caerwigau. In the 14th century a family known as ‚ÄúLlewelyn of Caerwigga‚Äù were established. The old manor house was founded in Tudor times and stands today as Caerwigau Isaf, a Grade II listed building. The first record of a priest of Pendoylan is early in the 13th century. He is one ‚ÄúUrban‚Äù ‚ÄúSacredos de Pondewelin‚Äù but there is a fairly complete list of incumbents from Elizabethan times. The estate at Hensol dates at least from the early 15th century and Hensol House (now Grade I listed Hensol Castle) was built in the 16th century. It has been home to a succession of eminent people including Judge David Jenkins (1582‚Äì1663) the staunch royalist who nearly lost his head in the civil war, Charles Talbot (1685‚Äì1737) who served in Walpole's government becoming Lord Chancellor in 1733 and taking the title Baron Talbot of Hensol, Benjamin Hall (1778‚Äì1817), whose son became Baron Lanover and may have given his name to the Palace of Westminster's ‚ÄúBig Ben‚Äù, the ‚ÄúIron King‚Äù of Merthyr Tydfil William Crawshay II (1788‚Äì1867) who later built Cyfarthfa Castle, another ironmaster, Rowland Fothergill (1794‚Äì1871) of Abernant who in 1853 commissioned David Brandon to rebuild Pendoylan Parish Church and his sister Mary (1797‚Äì1887) who built and endowed a new school building for Pendoylan in his memory in 1873. Pendoylan Church and Pub (November 2011) Following Pendoylan having won the Environment Category in the 2004 Calor Village of the Year for Wales competition, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, visited the village and met residents on 14 July 2005 . He presented a plaque and said in his speech \\"It is a real joy to see such a wonderful functioning village with such a sense of community\\".  Amenities  The parish church is dedicated to Saint Cadoc. It contains some interesting features which can definitely be assigned to pre-reformation times, the chancel arch being in the early perpendicular style of the 14th century. Other features are of 14th-, 15th- and 16th-century perpendicular with 19th-century alterations. There is a row of six cottages just to the north of the church that were built in 1817 as almshouses from a bequest of ¬£50 from Earl Talbot of Hensol and ¬£50 from one Philip John. They were of very basic one up one down plus kitchen construction with a fireplace stair. No. 1 was subsequently rebuilt as a school. The village school is a Church in Wales Primary School It was under threat of closure in the 1980s, the roll having fallen from 103 in 1981 to 74 in 1986. Since the arrival of a new head teacher in 1994, it has become much more popular, with up to 220 pupils, many of whom travel from outside the parish. Old temporary buildings are being replaced with permanent structures in 2011/12. Inspectors in 2008 said the following. > \\"This is a good school with many outstanding features. Pupils make very good > progress and achieve high standards because of the very good teaching they > receive. The provision is of high quality and the school leadership > successfully promotes a caring Christian ethos, which is appreciated by > parents and pupils alike. Throughout the school, pupils make outstanding > progress in their learning and achieve high standards. Pupils succeed > regardless of their social, ethnic or linguistic backgrounds and make very > good progress towards fulfilling their potential. They are very well > prepared for the next phase of their education.\\" The village pub is called 'The Red Lion'. Records of this inn date back to the early 19th century, when the publican was also a farmer, but it is probably older than that. It closed in July 2010 and re-opened in October 2011, following a complete refurbishment. As well as a bar, there is a 150-seat restaurant with a downstairs and an upstairs dining area, which has a terrace providing views over the Ely valley and beyond. There is also a Chapel which houses the Bethania Presbyterian Church (originally Calvinistic Methodism) and a Village Hall built in the 1930s as a memorial to those who died in the first world war. The Vale Resort is located at Hensol in the North of Pendoylan, close to Junction 34 of the M4. It consists of a four star hotel, two championship golf courses and a leisure centre, with a swimming pool and gym.

In 2017 it was decided to build a new grate based incinerator to replace the Energos plant by 2019. Energos technology The Energos system includes a close coupled combustion stage which, as configured, uses all the syngas in the combustion stage. It is thus not able to produce syngas for external use and therefore sometimes categorized as two-stage combustion. The process enables improved control of the combustion to minimise the formation of combustion related emissions such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Total Organic Carbons (TOC). Operating plants achieve average annual NOx emissions of 25 ‚Äì 30% of the EU limit using just process control and without the need for either Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) or Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), whilst at the same time achieving very low CO and TOC emissions. The energy in the combusted syngas is converted into steam. Energos plants produce steam at lower temperature and pressure than modern waste incinerators, and thus achieve low energy-efficiencies compared to incinerators. As a CHP or heat delivery plant, the cycle efficiency is approaching 85%. One such example is the recently constructed Sarpsborg 2 plant, which provides process steam to the Borregaard Chemical Plant, directly displacing heavy fuel oil. The Isle of Wight plant debuts a new furnace design for the Energos process aimed at increased combustion efficiency, dust removal and enabling less interruptions and downtime than the earlier designMSW Spells Self-Sufficiency for Isle of Wight Residents, Article in Biomass Magazine, August 2009.

Background  Cui Dunli was born in 596, originally named Cui Yuanli, His family was from \\"the second house of Boling\\" of the prominent Cui clan of Boling, although by the end of Northern Wei it had already relocated to Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). Cui Dunli's grandfather Cui Zhongfang (Â¥î‰ª≤Êñπ) served as the minister of ceremonies during Sui Dynasty. It was said that Cui studied biographies and had sought to keep himself faithful and righteous.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  During the reign of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu, Cui Dunli served as a mid-low-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). It was said that he was skillful with his words and always acted appropriately, so much so that people were intimidated when they saw him. It was during Emperor Gaozu's reign that Emperor Gaozu changed his name from the original Yuanli to Dunli, although the reason was not stated in historical records. In 626, Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, locked in an intense sibling rivalry with his older brother and Emperor Gaozu's oldest son, Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, killed Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi at the Incident at Xuanwu Gate and effectively seized power. Emperor Gaozu's distant nephew Li Yuan (ÊùéÁëó, different character than Emperor Gaozu's name) the Prince of Lujiang, who was then commandant at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Beijing), was an ally of Li Jiancheng's, and when Li Shimin sent Cui to You Prefecture to summon Li Yuan to the capital Chang'an. Li Yuan became fearful, and at the instigation of his deputy Wang Junkuo (ÁéãÂêõÂªì) started a rebellion. He seized Cui and tried to force Cui to reveal military secrets of the imperial army, but Cui refused. Soon, Wang himself rebelled against Li Yuan and seized him, surrendering to the imperial forces. Upon Cui's return to Chang'an, Li Shimin made him a commander of the imperial guards and awarded him with gold and good horse(s).  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Later in 626, Emperor Gaozu passed the throne to Li Shimin, who took the throne as Emperor Taizong. In 627, Emperor Taizong promoted Cui Dunli to a higher post within the legislative bureau. It was said that particularly because Cui admired the great Han Dynasty diplomat Su Wu, he was frequently sent as a diplomat to Eastern Tujue. At a later point, Cui became the deputy minister of defense, a post that he still held as of 642, when he was sent to Eastern Tujue's successor state Xueyantuo to negotiate a marriage of Emperor Taizong's daughter Princess Xinxing with Xueyantuo's Zhenzhu Khan Yi'nan, in order to gain the release of the general Qibi Heli (Â•ëËãæ‰ΩïÂäõ), who had been held captive by Xueyantuo. He later served as the commandant at Ling Prefecture (ÈùàÂ∑û, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and then was summoned back to Chang'an to serve as minister of defense. He was serving in that post as of 646, when he was sent to negotiate the surrender of Yi'nan's nephew the Yitewushi Khan Duomozhi (with Xueyantuo then in a state of collapse), although apparently before he could arrive, Duomozhi surrendered to the general Li Shiji. After Xueyantuo's collapse, its vassal Huige briefly took over its territory, but Huige itself was severely weakened in 648 when its ruler Yaoluoge Tumidu (Ëó•ÁæÖËëõÂêêËø∑Â∫¶) was assassinated by his nephew Yaoluoge Wuge (Ëó•ÁæÖËëõÁÉèÁ¥á). Emperor Taizong, apprehensive that Huige would collapse and lead to a new round of disturbances, sent Cui to pacify the Huige people and to create Yaoluoge Tumidu's son Yaoluoge Porun (Ëó•ÁæÖËëõÂ©ÜÈñè) as the new ruler of Huige.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 649, Emperor Taizong died and was succeeded by his son Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). Cui Dunli continued to serve as minister of defense, and in 652, he commissioned Cui with an army to gather the remaining tribesmen of Xueyantuo to force them relocate to Qilian Prefecture (Á•ÅÈÄ£Â∑û, a prefecture established for them in modern Datong, Shanxi). Later that year, Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Gaoyang, her husband Fang Yi'ai (ÊàøÈÅ∫ÊÑõ), Emperor Gaozong's uncle Li Yuanjing (ÊùéÂÖÉÊôØ) the Prince of Jing, Emperor Gaozong's brother Li Ke the Prince of Wu, another brother-in-law Chai Lingwu (Êü¥‰ª§Ê≠¶), and the general Xue Wanche (ËñõËê¨Âæπ), were implicated in a plot to overthrow Emperor Gaozong and replace him with Li Yuanjing. (According to traditional historians, Li Ke was not involved in the plot, but was falsely implicated by Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji, who was apprehensive that Li Ke was older and considered more capable than Emperor Gaozong.) Some of them were executed, and some were ordered to commit suicide. Emperor Gaozong initially wanted to spare Li Yuanjing and Li Ke, but at Cui's opposition did not do so. In 653, Cui was made Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠) -- the head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. He became in charge of editing imperial histories, and he was created the Duke of Gu'an. In 655, he was made Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§), the head of the legislative bureau and still a chancellor post. In 656, Cui, who had been given an additional post as a staff member of Emperor Gaozong's son and crown prince Li Hong as well, offered to resign on account of illness. Emperor Gaozong gave him the post as an advisor to Li Hong and no longer let him serve as Zhongshu Ling, but gave him the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. Emperor Gaozong also recalled Cui's younger brother Cui Yuqing (Â¥îÈ§òÊÖ∂), who was then serving as the military advisor to the commandant at Dingxiang (ÂÆöË•Ñ, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), from Dingxiang, to attend to Cui Dunli. Cui Dunli died less a month later. Emperor Gaozong personally led a public mourning and buried him with honors, near Emperor Taizong's tomb.

(1986) De westelijke eilanden van Amsterdam, p. 17. He controlled the city's politics in close cooperation with his uncle Jacob Dircksz de Graeff and his brother Cornelis Bicker. The Bicker family was one of the oldest patrician families of Amsterdam ‚Äì consisting of Andries' father Gerrit, a grain merchant and beer brewer, and his three brothers, Jacob, Jan and Cornelis, had a firm grip on world trade, trading on the East, the West, the North and the Mediterranean. (His uncle Laurens Bicker was one of the first to trade on Guinea and seized four Portuguese ships in 1604). In 1646, seven members of the Bicker family, called the Bicker's league, simultaneously held some political position or other. The Bickers provided silver and ships to Spain, and were very much interested in ending the Eighty Years War. This brought them in conflict with the stadtholder, some provinces, like Zeeland and Utrecht, and the Reformed preachers.Israel, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 545. Life Andries became a member of the vroedschap in 1616, in 1620 schepen of Amsterdam and in 1627, just over forty, mayor of Amsterdam. He came to the fore through his knowledge and moderation. In 1627, he was delegated to go to Sweden and Poland, to close negotiations between these two countries, mediate a peace (culminating in the Treaty of Sztumska Wie≈õ) and at the same time set up new Baltic trade agreements. In 1631 he was the owner of a few plots in Spanderswoud in 's-Graveland, the site where now the fine Trompenburgh house stands. The Bicker family also had concerns in peat-digging in Drenthe. At the solemn entry of Maria de Medici into Amsterdam in 1638, he and Albert Burgh welcomed her in the name of the city's government. In 1643, he went with Jacob de Witt to Sweden to mediate between Sweden and Denmark. Andries Bicker opposed the stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, who intended the centralize the five admiralties, which would cause the Admiralty of Amsterdam to lose influence.Burke, P. (1974) Venice and Amsterdam. London: Temple Smith, p. 59? After the Peace of M√ºnster was signed, Bicker was of the opinion that it was no longer necessary to maintain a standing army, bringing him into vehement conflict with prince Willem II,Israel, J.

To regain power William went on the march towards Dordrecht and Amsterdam with an army. His troops got lost in a dense fog and were discovered by the postal courier on Hamburg, who also warned Andries' son Gerard, the high bailiff of Muiden, to leave without delay for Amsterdam. The mayors of Amsterdam had the civic guard called out, the bridges raised, the gates closed and the artillery dragged into position. Andries Bicker was purged from the vroedschap, as was his brother Cornelis, as one of the conditions of the treaty that followed, led by Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen.Israel, J.

He was named after his great grandfather Sir John Norreys, who had established this branch of the Norreys family as extensive landowners in the county of Berkshire. The Norreys family members often held positions of importantance at the English court. John's father Edward, the eldest son and heir of Sir William Norreys, had taken part in the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487, dying shortly afterwards. John was then his grandfather's heir, and succeeded to the Norreys family estates upon the old man's death in 1507. The estates included major residences such as Yattendon Castle and Ockwells and minor lands like Norreys Manor in Wokingham. Murderer In 1517, John murdered one John Enhold of Nettlebed in unknown circumstances. He was fined 1,000 marks and had to surrender Ockwells. In return by his brother, Henry, obtained a pardon for him. His uncle, Sir Thomas Fettiplace, took possession of Ockwells. Marriage John married Elizabeth Braye (born c. 1490), daughter of John Braye of Eaton Bray, whose family was as important in England as the Norreys family. Elizabeth's brother, Edmund Braye (d. 1539), was the 1st Baron Braye, a title created for him in 1529. Her brother, Edward Braye (d. 1558), was a Member of Parliament. The couple was childless. Royal associations John rose in favour at Court, perhaps with the help of his mother, and became the Esquire of the body of King Henry VII, and later the usher of the outer chamber to both King Henry VIII and King Edward VI. Described as \\"a rank papist\\", he was later promoted to be chief usher of the privy chamber to Queen Mary Tudor. He retired to Ashampstead upon the accession of Queen Elizabeth. In 1520, John entertained King Henry VIII and his Queen Catherine of Aragon at Yattendon Castle. Later life When John's younger brother, Sir Henry Norreys, was beheaded in 1536 for his supposed adultery with the queen, Anne Boleyn, John and his wife, Elizabeth, took over the care of Henry's orphaned children Henry and Mary. Having no legitimate children of his own, John was licensed to settle his estates in reversion on his nephew in December 1542.

Seeing the forced smile on Officer Xia's face at the retirement party, Xia Tian silently tells herself that she must help her father find his gun back. Ah Jiang, Fang Wei and Bulu are discussing how to help Officer Xia find his gun when Xia Tian shows up. She asks Ah Jiang to consider the principal's exchange conditions ‚Äì don‚Äôt be expelled and stay in school to help Officer Xia to find his gun. Ah Jiang has already decided to help Officer Xia find his gun, but he deliberately teases Xia Tian saying that she is only asking for his help because she doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚ÄúAh Lu Ka‚Äù by Kong Long. Xia Tian's worries are mocked by Ah Jiang which makes her upset, and she runs out into the rainy night in tears. Ah Jiang is startled to realize that he has hurt Xia Tian and in the quiet night, he sends a text message to Xia Tian telling her that he will definitely go to school tomorrow.

No one is going to stop you.‚Äù On the other hand, the sulking Xia Tian hears Xiao Han saying that she has decided to confess her feelings to Ah Jiang and also asks Xia Tian for her help. Xia Tian has mixed feelings in her heart and doesn‚Äôt know how she is supposed to respond. In order to investigate Officer Xia's missing gun, everyone arrives at the Sunny Haunted House for the first time, but they did not find any clues.

Ah Jiang, Fang Wei and Bulu, who have been childhood companions with Xia Tian and grew up together with her, are all staring at the scene in front of them speechless. Without a care for his own safety, Ah Jiang charges toward Grey Wolf to protect Xia Tian. Grey Wolf is startled by the sudden movement and the bullet shoots right at Ah Jiang. During the surgery in the operation room, one of Ah Jiang's arteries bursts and his heart stops beating.

When she looks at the first birthday present that Ah Jiang gave her, she reminisces about each and every detailed memory that she has growing up with Ah Jiang. In the last photo, she unexpectedly discovers the firefly that Ah Jiang drew along with the words ‚ÄúGiving you two autumn fireflies, wish you a happy birthday! May everything go as you wish!

As for D.K., he turns out to be the orphan of an innocent bystander who was injured by a stray bullet 10 years ago when Officer Xia was on duty trying to capture criminals. At that time, Officer Xia temporarily gave shelter to D.K., and then D.K. was adopted by his relatives in the U.S. Now, D.K. is actually an outstanding police officer and in order to arrest international drug lord Du Xiao, D.K. becomes an undercover cop. D.K. and Officer Xia's reunion causes Xia Tian to remember her childhood memories. In addition to Ah Jiang's miraculous recovery, Xia Tian and Tian Ji Ge aka D.K. talk enthusiastically about the past. This puts pressure on Ah Jiang's newly growing love for Xia Tian. Fortunately, he still has his two good buddies, Fang Wei and Bulu, to help plan a perfect and romantic date. Fang Wei even provides one of his family's vacation villas on a private island for Ah Jiang to use as a battlefield against Tian Ji Ge. Unexpected visitors appear on the romantic private island beach. At the vacation villa, Xia Tian is filled with joy and anticipates the very first date that Ah Jiang has planned so carefully. When they were both enjoying this romantic time together, Fang Wei, Bulu, Du Xiao, D.K. and the special crimes unit unexpectedly show up... Is this the surprise that Fang Wei and Bulu are giving to Ah Jiang? Or is this something that Tian Ji Ge planned for intentionally? A romantic battlefield or a beautiful risk? Episode 11 Originally it was supposed to be a perfect, romantic and luxurious date, but because of the unexpectedly appearance of Du Xiao, it caused Xia Tian much embarrassment. The plan that D.K. spent three years planning also failed. Ah Jiang admits that his childish manner towards love is what causes Xia Tian to get hurt. Even though Xia Tian is angry and hurt, but she has already forgiven Ah Jiang in her heart. However, Ah Jiang doesn‚Äôt know that and he is still trying to think of ways to make it up to Xia Tian. In order to save them, D.K. injured himself with his own gun. Xia Tian feels extremely bad over this, and she carefully picks up the pieces of the wind chime that Tian Ji Ge stepped on. She puts it inside a small bag and returns it to D.K. In order to resolve D.K. and Ah Jiang's misunderstanding, Xia Tian spends the whole night making a new wind chime. The next morning, she wakes up D.K. and goes with him to hang the wind chime up at the street corner where he and his girlfriend broke up. D.K. is greatly touched and he kisses and hugs Xia Tian. Xia Tian is extremely surprised and Ah Jiang, who sees all of this from across the street, is stunned. There are only 3 days left before the graduation dance. Within the Ying Ye campus, everyone is bustling around with excitement and happily discussing who they will be going to the dance with. In everyone's eyes, it is perfectly natural that Xia Tian and Ah Jiang will be going as a couple. Unexpectedly the scene of the early morning hug between D.K. and Xia Tian causes Ah Jiang to treat Xia Tian very coldly and without much emotion on his face. Xia Tian and everyone have no idea what is going on. Because of the gun incident on Westside Street, Ying Ye School specially arranges a self-defense class for everyone. The guest teacher of this self-defense class turns out to be Mr. D.K. Xu. Ah Jiang is called up to the stage for a demonstration. Will the impulsive Ah Jiang use this demonstration as training or as retaliation? Does D.K. regard Xia Tian as a younger sister or another lover? The waves of love are slowly surging; Ying Ye 3+1 invites you to fan the wind and light the fire. Episode 12 Fang Wei and Bulu are going all around searching for evidence to help Ah Jiang prove to Xia Tian that D.K. has other motives. In order to give Xia Tian an unforgettable prom night, Ah Jiang accepted a temporary stunt drive job under Bulu's father's introduction. The simple trail test was no problem for Ah Jiang at all. He had so much confidence that he asked for half of the pay in advance from the director and takes Xia Tian to go shopping for tomorrow's prom. He wants Xia Tian to be the girl that everyone in the entire school will be envious of. In the career line of the school's employment counseling form, Xia Tian fills in ‚ÄúGuan Dong Shop‚Äôs boss.‚Äù When Officer Xia receives the form from D.K., many feelings well up inside his heart. What is the correct way to plan Xia Tian's future? D.K. immediately suggests to Officer Xia that with Xia Tian's skills, the U.S.‚Äôs Federal Law Enforcement training organization specializes in recruiting and training various countries‚Äô special talents for the police force. Xia Tian and Ah Jiang should fall into the group of people that they are looking for. Officer Xia immediately hopes that Xia Tian will go to the U.S. to advance her studies as per D.K.‚Äôs suggestion. However, Xia Tian doesn‚Äôt want to spend all of her father‚Äôs retirement money. She also doesn‚Äôt want to leave Westside Street, where she has spent her whole life, her friends and Ah Jiang. Ah Jiang‚Äôs temporary job is actually an advertisement MV shoot for the famous celebrity, Joyce. Aside from the driving stunt, he will also have to film an intimate scene with her. Ah Jiang will be playing right into the hands of the celebrity. Coincidentally, D.K. arrives to assist and patrol the area around the filming scene. Xia Tian also comes to join in the fun. Episode 13 Bulu still hasn‚Äôt finished his graduation paper yet. Fang Wei, Xiao Han, and Xiao Hui all kept him company at the library overnight while Bulu worked on his paper. Xiao Hui helps Bulu to gather much information. In an English periodical about the wisdom of criminal psychology, they discover a published article called ‚ÄúPsychology of an Avenger, by D.K. Hsu.‚Äù The case in the article causes one to be frightened and alarmed. When the murderer was a child, he once witnessed his mother's death from a police officer's stray bullet. In one night, he becomes an orphan. He swears to become a police officer and carefully plans his revenge. The target of his revenge will be the daughter of the police officer who killed his mother! The content of the article seems vaguely similar to Officer Xia, Xia Tian and D.K.‚Äôs situation. Suddenly the atmosphere becomes very tense and everyone stares at each other and trembles with fear. Early in the morning, Ah Jiang has to head over to the place where he will be filming the advertisement MV with Joyce. In order to come up with the money to return to D.K., Xia Tian finds herself a job. Officer Xia hands over the newspaper for Xia Tian to see. A huge picture of Joyce kissing Ah Jiang is published as headline news in the Entertainment section. Since Xia Tian was also at the scene of the filming yesterday, she helps Ah Jiang to explain things with her father. She says that the media is doing this just to create news about Joyce. Ah Jiang and Xia Tian meet on the road. Ah Jiang persuades Xia Tian to obey Officer Xia's arrangements and go with D.K. to the U.S. to study criminology. Xia Tian insists that she will only have happiness wherever Ah Jiang is. After seeing a job posting, Xia Tian arrives at a certain office to apply for a job. Her job is to dress up in a cute nurse outfit with lots of makeup and stand out on the streets to recruit customers for an X-rated motel. Xia Tian awkwardly starts to call out to people passing by. Suddenly she gets arrested by a police officer and is taken to the police station on the charge of indecent behavior in public. The speechless Xia Tian could only wait for the furious Officer Xia and D.K. to come and bail her out. Ah Jiang works furiously to perform well. He still loses control while performing the driving stunt and the flying dust injures his eye. However, he still manages to finish this filming shoot. After his work ended, Ah Jiang gets the remainder of the money of $20,000NT. He is just about to rush off to the school to attend the graduation dance, when Joyce asks him why waste so much effort on love? D.K. takes the photo of Xia Tian dressed up in a nurse outfit with heavy makeup to question Ah Jiang if this is how Xia Tian will be dressed up in the future. Are the contents written in D.K.‚Äôs paper real? Or is he just practicing his writing skills? Xia Tian's job lands her in the police station. How will Officer Xia face the looks from his colleagues? What will become of Ah Jiang and Xia Tian's future? What is the legend of Ying Ye School's graduation dance? Episode 14 The graduation dance party has already ended. Xia Tian is still anticipating the appearance of Ah Jiang. Under everyone's consolation, Xia Tian still insists on waiting at Westside Street for Ah Jiang's arrival in the downpour. D.K. receives a call from Ah Jiang who asks D.K. to go and pick up Xia Tian. After spending a whole night out in the rain and being emotionally hurt, Xia Tian falls sick. Ah Jiang watches from the side helplessly as D.K. takes the sick Xia Tian away. The tears in Ah Jiang's heart are even bigger than the rain that is falling down from the sky. Early the next morning, D.K. confesses his feelings to Xia Tian. Xia Tian couldn‚Äôt accept him and seizes the chance to leave and go to Ah Jiang's house to ask him what is going on. Joyce also coincidentally arrives at Ah Jiang's house to ask him if he is willing to be her bodyguard. In order to get Xia Tian to give up on him, Ah Jiang asks Joyce to help him out by putting on an act. He wants to deliberately make Xia Tian mad so that she can let go of her feelings for him and pursue a better future. Fang Wei and Bulu can‚Äôt stand the attitude that Ah Jiang is showing towards Xia Tian. They angrily throw down the diploma and leave with Xia Tian. Joyce can actually see through Ah Jiang's heart and knows that he still loves Xia Tian very deeply. She also seems to realize that there seems to be some problems with Ah Jiang's eyes and she requests Ah Jiang to go see a doctor immediately. A few days ago, D.K.‚Äôs attempt to catch Solomen has still not succeeded yet. In order to avoid becoming Solomen's prey, D.K. hides out for a few days at Officer Xia's house. The landlord calls him and tells him that there are strange sounds coming from his house and that the police dog that he raises has not been seen for a couple of days. A coldness spreads over D.K.‚Äôs heart. He immediately gathers the special police force to discuss their next plan of action. The 100th episode of a popular variety show is being filmed at the amusement park. Xia Tian puts all her pride and feelings aside to participate in the show in hopes of getting Ah Jiang's eyes back on her again. A building eight stories high, mixed emotions, what sort of feelings will fly out of control? Or will the scene be out of control? Or perhaps the plan will get out of control? Episode 15 Putting all her pride and feelings on the line, Xia Tian jumps down from a high building. In the end, Ah Jiang manages to catch her. Everyone on the scene was praising and applauding while calling out in alarm. The director of the program was also deeply moved by this touching scene and believes that when this 100th episode is broadcast, the ratings will fly off the charts. Unexpectedly, Ah Jiang turns Xia Tian over to D.K. and tells her that her future is in the hands of D.K. and not himself. He coldly leaves and Xia Tian's heart is torn to pieces. Even Joyce can‚Äôt stand Ah Jiang's actions and after giving him a scolding, she fires him. Xia Tian decides to go with D.K. to the U.S. to advance her studies. Fang Wei and Bulu still have their doubts about D.K. With regards to Xia Tian's decision and Ah Jiang's behavior, Fang Wei and Bulu rack their brains out hoping that those two will be able to get back together. They invited Xiao Han and Xiao Hui to plan a 3+1 farewell camping party. They also hope to expose D.K.‚Äôs conspiracy as soon as possible. Ah Jiang's vision is getting worse and worse. The answer that the doctor gives to Ah Jiang causes him to lose all his will and he becomes absent minded when he does things. As a result, under Fang Wei's deliberate arrangement, Ah Jiang reluctantly accepts the 3+1 farewell camping party. On the eve before Xia Tian's departure, they will revisit their memories one last time. Officer Xia has to attend his last mission with D.K. before his retirement. He tells Xia Tian to leave a happy memory with her childhood friends. After coming home from the camping trip, she should gather up her feelings, pack her bags and go along with D.K. to the U.S. to study. It turns out that this mission is to capture Solomen. After 3 years of planning, Solomen got away the first time and D.K. wants to goad him and capture him. Did Officer Xia voluntarily join in this mission because he wants to make up and repay the guilt and shame that he has towards D.K.?

Location Located at the south-eastern end of the Hutt River, the suburb's name Moera is thought to be a simplification of Moe-i-te-ra, meaning \\"sleeping in the sun\\". Randwick Road, Moera History Prior to European settlement, the Moera area was part of a large tidal estuary at the mouth of the Awamutu and Waiwhet≈´ Streams. The southern side of Waiwhet≈´ Stream contained a number of Ngati Ira villages. In 1843 William Trotter settled in the area and established a fruit garden and nursery. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake raised the Hutt Valley from 1 to 2 metres, thus draining the swampy estuary. The area remained farmland up until 1926 when the Petone Railway Workshops were moved to Moera and Government sponsored prefabricated workers housing, built by the Railways Department, were sold to families. Influence Typical Moera railway Cottage To house the workers almost 600 kitset homes were built to a simple 5 room layout. The whole project was completed by May 1927. These provided a template for State housing developments in later years. Many of the current houses are original Railways Department built prefabricated cottages dating from that era.

The term ahinsa means nonviolence, non-injury and absence of desire to harm any life forms. Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa. The Jain concept of ahimsa is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies. Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others. But according to the Jain philosophy, violence refers primarily to injuring one's own self ‚Äì behaviour which inhibits the soul's own ability to attain moksha (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths). At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one's own soul. Furthermore, the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential. All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential. Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ahimsa. According to Jainism, protection of life, also known as abhayadƒÅnam, is the supreme charity that a person can make. \\"Giving protection always to living beings who are in fear of death is known as abhayadana\\" Ahimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence. \\"Even an intention of killing is the cause of the bondage of Karma, whether you actually kill or not; from the real point of view, this is the nature of the bondage of Karma.\\" Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages. Overview Jain texts expound that there are ten life essentials or life-principles; these are: the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind. Living beings are classified on the basis of their sensory organs () and life essentials () they possess. According to Jain texts: *The one-sensed lives possess four essentials ‚Äì sense organ of touch, strength of body or energy, respiration, and life-duration. *The two-sensed beings have six, namely the sense of taste and the organ of speech in addition to the former four. *The three-sensed beings have seven with the addition of the sense of smell. *The four-sensed beings have eight with the addition of the sense of sight. *The five- sensed beings without mind have nine life- principles with the addition of the sense of hearing. Those endowed with mind are said to have ten vitalities with the addition of the mind. According to Tattvarthasutra, one of the most important Jainism scriptures, \\"the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury\\". Therefore, the higher the number of senses and vitalities a being has, the more is its capacity to suffer and feel pain. Hence according to Jainism, violence to higher-sensed beings like man, cow, tiger and those who have five senses and the capacity to think and feel pain attracts more karma than violence to lesser-sensed beings like insects, or single-sensed beings like microbes and plants. Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). But, the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one-sensed form of life to the best of his ability. Hence Jainism enjoins its adherents to completely avoid violence to higher-sensed beings and as far as possible minimise violence to lower-sensed and single-sensed beings. Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self- defence can be justified,Nisithabhasya (in Nisithasutra) 289; Jinadatta Suri: Upadesharasayana 26; Dundas pp. 162‚Äì163; T√§htinen p. 31. and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.Jindal pp. 89‚Äì90; Laidlaw pp. 154‚Äì155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: Ahimsa and \\"Just War\\" in Jainism, in: Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism, ed. Tara Sethia, New Delhi 2004, p. 52‚Äì60; T√§htinen p. 31. Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.Harisena, Brhatkathakosa 124 (10th century); Jindal pp. 90‚Äì91; Sangave p. 259. Vow of AhimsƒÅ In Jainism, both ascetics and householders (≈õrƒÅvaka) have to follow five major vows (). Ascetics observe these fives vows more strictly and therefore observe complete abstinence. 1\\\\. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The votary must not to hurt any living being by actions, words or thoughts. The Jain text Puru≈üƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya deals with the conduct required of the householder (≈õrƒÅvaka) and therefore discusses the fundamental vow of Ahimsa in detail. There are two types of Ahimsa - Bhaav Ahimsa and Karm Ahimsa. Bhaav Ahimsa is thinking to hurt someone in the thoughts and intentions whereas Karm Ahimsa is hurting someone through some actions or words. The text expounds that \\"all these subdivisions (injury, falsehood, stealing, unchastity, and attachment) are hi·πÉsƒÅ as indulgence in these sullies the pure nature of the soul. Falsehood etc. have been mentioned separately only to make the disciple understand through illustrations.\\" 2\\\\. Satya (Truth)- The underlying cause of falsehood is passion and therefore, it is said to cause hi·πÉsƒÅ (injury). According to Jain text SarvƒÅrthasiddhi, translates S.A. Jain, \\"that which causes pain and suffering to the living is not commendable, whether it refers to actual facts or not is immaterial\\". 3\\\\. Asteya (Non-thieving)- According to Puru≈üƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya: 4\\\\. Brahmacharya- It means chastity for householders and celibacy in action, words & thoughts for ascetics. 5\\\\. Aparigraha (Non- possession)- According to Jain texts, attachment to possessions (parigraha) is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (ƒÅbhyantara parigraha), and attachment to external possessions (bƒÅhya parigraha). The fourteen internal possessions are: Wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, and neuter sex-passion), also the six defects (laughter, liking, disliking, sorrow, fear, and disgust), and four passions (anger, pride, deceitfulness, and greed). According to Jain texts, \\"internal possessions are proved to be hi·πÉsƒÅ as these are just another name for himsƒÅ\\". External possessions are divided into two sub-classes, the non-living, and the living. \\"External possessions, due to the passion of attachment in them, result into himsƒÅ.\\" Ascetic practices for adherence to Ahimsa These five vows are called (major vows) when observed by an ascetic. is the first and foremost of all vows. Jain monks and nuns must rank among the most \\"nonviolent\\" people in the world. A Jain ascetic is expected to uphold the vow of to the highest standard, even at the cost of his own life. The other four major vows ‚Äì truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession and celibacy ‚Äì are in fact extension of the first vow of complete nonviolence. \\"Ahimsa is the heart of all stages of life, the core of all sacred texts, and the sum () and substance () of all vows and virtues.\\" The ascetic practices of total renunciation of worldly affairs and possessions, refusal to stay in a single place for a long time, continuous practice of austerities like fasting etc. are geared towards observance of . The Jain mendicants abide by a rigorous set of rules of conduct, where they must eat, sleep and even walk with full diligence and with an awareness that even walking kills several hundreds of minute beings. Jain ascetics sweep the ground before them to avoid injuring the most minuscule forms of life. They generally brush the ground clear of insects before they tread. Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and eat food only when it is not prepared for themselves. Ascetics of the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara tradition wear a small mask to avoid taking in tiny insects. The observation of three or the controls of mind, speech and body and five samiti are designed to help the monks in observing the vow of Ahimsa faultlessly. A monk is required to cultivate the habit of carefulness (samti), in respect of the following five particulars:- #walking, so as not to injure any living being; #speech, so as not to cause pain to any one by offensive, disagreeable language, or by a careless use of words having a tendency to incite others to violent deeds; #eating, so as not to cause injury to any living being; #handling things ‚Äî the water gourd, books and the feather whisk, with which there is a great danger of injury to small insects; and #evacuation and disposal of faeces, urine, and the like. The entire day of a Jain monk is spent in ensuring that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hi·πÉsƒÅ (injury). Householders adherence to the vow A Jain layman, on account of his household and occupational compulsions, is unable to adhere to the five major vows of ascetic. Hence he observes a·πáuvrata or minor vows which although are similar to the major vows of the ascetics are observed with a lesser severity. It is difficult to avoid some violence by a lay person to single- sensed immobile beings in the process of occupation, cooking, self-defense etc. That is why he vows not to kill without a necessary purpose and determined intention, a moving sentient being, when it is innocent. Tying up, injuring, mutilating, burdening with heavy load and depriving from food and drinks any animal or human being, with one's mind polluted by anger and other passions are the five ' or transgressions of the vow of ahimsa. However, it is to be understood that ultimately, there is limited spiritual progress and no emancipation unless the major vows are adhered to. Jainism is perhaps the only religion in the world that requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades. Transgressions Jain text list down five transgressions of the vow of ahimsa: #Tying up animals too tightly, #Beating them mercilessly, #Cutting their limbs, #Overloading them, #Neglecting to feed them properly. A king who fights in defending his empire, however, does not violate the vow of ahimsa, for his motive is to protect his subjects. The same is the case with the judge who punishes to maintain law and order. Philosophical overview=Important constituents While Jainism enjoins observance of total nonviolence by the ascetics, it is often argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating, drinking, breathing and surviving in order to support his body. According to Jainism, life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of the universe. Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals, but it is impossible to avoid killing of subtle microorganisms in air and water, plant life and various types of insects that may be crushed by walking. However, the Jain conception of ahimsa is quite different from what is commonly understood by violence. The violence is defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment. =Carefulness= According to Jainism, a monk who is careless in his activities is guilty of violence irrespective of whether a living being remains alive or dies; on the other hand, the person who is ever vigilant and careful in observing the samitis experiences no karmic bondage simply because some violence may have taken place in connection with his activities. Carefulness came to be seen as a defence for the monks against violence in Jainism. TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra defines hi·πÉsƒÅ or violence simply as removal of life by careless activity of mind, body and speech. Thus action in Jainism came to be regarded as truly violent only when accompanied by carelessness. =Mental states and intention= Ahimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence. Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages. Ahimsa being central to the Jain philosophy, Jain ƒÄcƒÅryas have produced, through ages, quite elaborate and detailed doctrinal materials concerning its various aspects. Paul Dundas quotes ƒÄcƒÅrya Jinabhadra (7th century), who shows that the omnipresence of life-forms in the universe need not totally inhibit normal behaviour of the ascetics: Thus pure intention along with carefulness was considered necessary to practice as Jains admitted that even if intention may be pure, careless activities often resulted in violence unknowingly. =Knowledge= The Jains also considered right knowledge as a prerequisite for practising . It is necessary to know what is living and what is non-living to practice faultlessly. A person who is confused between Living and non-living can never observe non-violence. Da≈õavaikƒÅlika S≈´tra declared: It further declares: The knowledge is also considered necessary to destroy Karmas. Sama·πá Sutta·πÅ declared: Anekantavada Anekantavada is the principle of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects. \\"One and the same person assumes the relationship of father, son, grandson, nephew and brother, but he is the father of one whose he is and not of the rest (so is the case with all the things).\\" Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes the world as a multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species. It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms. This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and Syadvada is its expression. According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (ekanta) in philosophy. The concept of syadvada allows the Jains to accept the truth in other philosophies from their perspectives, thus inculcating a tolerance for other viewpoints. Anekantvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that only Jainism is the right religious path. Various aspects and consequences of violence ƒÄcƒÅrya Am·πõtacandra has described as to how the consequences of violence (karmas attracted) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts. A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person, while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences. For instance, a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals. Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons, the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person. This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe karmas, while a follower binds much lesser karmas. One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for hi·πÉsƒÅ while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hi·πÉsƒÅ. For instance, a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery. Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others. This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else. often gives result of himsa to one and himsa may sometimes give result of ahimsa to another. For instance, one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ahimsa although resorting to violence, while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything.  and Types of violence While the Jain ascetics observe absolute nonviolence, so far as a Jain householder is concerned, the violence is categorised as follows: # or intentional violence ‚Äì Intentional violence knowingly done is the worst form of violence and is a transgression of the layperson's vow of nonviolence. Examples of are killing for hunting, amusement or decoration, or butchering for food or sacrifice or killing or hurting out of enmity, malice or mischief. has to be totally renounced by a householder. # or Self-defence ‚Äì One is allowed to practice self-defense against a robber, murderer, or any other criminal. This self-defense is necessary when evil attacks. # or domestic or household violence ‚Äì This violence is unavoidably committed in the course of preparing food, household cleanliness, washing, construction of houses, wells, etc. # or Occupational Violence ‚Äì This violence is connected to occupational undertakings like agriculture, building and operating industries, etc. :While has to be avoided at all costs, the other three types of hi·πÉsƒÅ, although unavoidable in some cases, should not exceed the strict requirements of fulfilling the duties of a householder. Furthermore, they should not be influenced by passions such as anger, greed, pride and deceit or they take the character of . Ways of committing violence Violence (Himsa) gouache on paper, 17th century, Gujarat depicts animals of prey with their victims. The princely couple symbolises love, which is another occasion of violence. It would be wrong, however, to conclude that only prohibits physical violence. An early Jain text says: \\"With the three means of punishment ‚Äì thoughts, words, deeds ‚Äì ye shall not injure living beings.\\" In fact, violence can be committed by combination of the following four factors: 1\\\\. The instrumentality of our actions. We can commit violence through :a. body i.e. physical action, :b. speech i.e. verbal action, or :c. mind i.e. mental actions 2\\\\. The process of committing violence. This includes whether :a. we only decide or plan to act, :b. we make preparations for the act e.g. like collecting necessary materials or weapons, or :c. we actually begin the action 3\\\\. The modality of our action, whether :a. we ourselves commit violence, :b. we instigate others to carry out the violence, or :c. we give our silent approval for the violence 4\\\\. The motivation for action. This includes which of the following negative emotions motivate the violence. :a. Anger :b. Greed :c. Pride :d. Manipulation or deceit In Jainism, \\"non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury (Ahimsa), and manifestation of such passions is injury (himsa).\\" This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures. The rationale of nonviolence Sculpture depicting the statement \\"ahimsƒÅ paramo dharma\\" (Photo:Ahinsa Sthal, Delhi) According to Jainism, the purpose of nonviolence is not because it is a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its observance is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path. Another aspect that provides a rationale to the avoidance of hi·πÉsƒÅ is that, any acts of himsƒÅ results in himsƒÅ to self. Any act of violence though outwardly is seen to harm others, harms the soul of the person indulging in the act. Thus by an act of violence, a soul may or may not injure the material vitalities known as of someone else, but always causes injury to its own bhƒÅva pra·πáa or the psychic vitalities by binding the soul with karmas. It would be entirely wrong to see Ahimsa in Jainism in any sentimental light. The Jain doctrine of non-injury is based on rational consciousness, not emotional compassion; on responsibility to self, not on a social fellow feeling. The motive of is totally self-centered and for the benefit of the individual. And yet, though the emphasis is on personal liberation, the Jain ethics makes that goal attainable only through consideration for others. Furthermore, according to the Jain karmic theory, each and every soul, including self, has reincarnated as an animal, plant or microorganism innumerable number of times besides re-incarnated as humans. The concept of is more meaningful when understood in conjunction with the concept of karmas. As the doctrine of transmigration of souls includes rebirth in animal as well as human form, it creates a humanitarian sentiment of kinship amongst all life forms. The motto of Jainism ‚Äì , translated as: all life is inter-related and it is the duty of souls to assist each other- also provides a rational approach of Jains towards Ahimsa. In conclusion, the insistence of ahimsa is not so much about non- injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The ultimate rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hi·πÉsƒÅ on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake. Ahimsa and vegetarianism Jain vegetarian diet is practised by the followers of Jain culture and philosophy. It is considered one of the most rigorous forms of a spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian, and it also excludes potatoes, onions and garlic, like the shojin-ryori cuisine of Japan. According to Am·πõtacandra S≈´ri: The strictest forms of Jain diet are practised by the monastic ascetics. It also excludes potatoes and other root vegetables. The scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. For Jains, lacto-vegetarianism (generally known simply as vegetarianism in India) is mandatory. Food which contains even small particles of the bodies of dead animals or eggs is absolutely unacceptable. Some Jain scholars and activists support veganism, as the industrial production of dairy products involves violence against cows. Strict Jains don't eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most root vegetables involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees. Jains are also not supposed to consume food left overnight because of contamination by microbes. Most Jain recipes substitute for potato with plantain. Misconceptions The Jain scriptures discuss various misconceptions that are harboured in case of Ahimsa. They often oppose the Vedic beliefs in sacrifices and other practices that justified violence in various ways. ƒÄcƒÅrya Amritacandra's Puru·π£ƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya discuss these wrong beliefs at length to alert the Jain laity to them. These misconceptions are as follows. Animal sacrifices The belief that animals were created for yajna (sacrifice) and hence it was not considered a slaughter, as it elevated not only the person making the sacrifice, but also the animals was also denounced by the Jains. Am·πõtacandra of condemned this practice by stating that it is a misconception to hold that Gods are pleased at sacrifices of living beings and there is no wrong in committing hi·πÉsƒÅ for the sake of religion. Am·πõtacandra says that animals should not be killed for guests or persons deserving respect as often advocated in certain scriptures. It is also a wrong belief that wild animals that kill many other animals should be killed. This is often justified in the name of hunting of ferocious animals like tigers for sport. Another wrong belief forwarded to justify killing of ferocious animals is that, these kill many lives and accumulate grave sins and hence killing them is an act of mercy. According to Jainism, killing can never be an act of mercy. It is also a misconception to believe that it is advisable to kill those who are suffering so that they may get relief from agony. These sorts of arguments are forwarded to justify killing of those animals that may have become old or injured and hence have become commercially useless. Wrong Beliefs Other wrong beliefs are killing those who are in state of happiness or those who are in meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the time of death will be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation. Fruits of nonviolence According to Jain texts, the fruits of himsƒÅ (violence) depends upon the severity of passions at the time of commencement of such an act. One may be responsible for the sinful act of himsƒÅ without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not be responsible for the act. Also, when two persons commit the act of himsƒÅ jointly, its consequences on fruition (of karma) may be grave for one person and mild for the other. According to Jains, the consequences of karma are inevitable. The consequences may take some time to take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions‚Äîlike proper time, place, and environment‚Äîto arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred. Appreciation , an important tenet of all the religions originating in India, is now considered as an article of faith by the adherents of the Indian religions. Mahatma Gandhi was of the view: Bal Gangadhar Tilak has credited Jainism with the cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi wrote the Jain slogan, Ahimsa parmo dharma, on Facebook's Real Wall at its headquarters, when he visited for a town hall question-and-answer session in September 2015.

New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (NZMFAT) is responsible for nearly fifty embassies and consulates globally. The country is particularly active in the South Pacific, as well as in Asia and South America where New Zealand is expanding its commercial reach. There is also an extensive number of honorary consulates who represent New Zealand. New Zealand's diplomatic missions in the capitals of other Commonwealth countries are called High Commissions (as opposed to embassies). History New Zealand independence was a gradual process, and the establishment of an independent New Zealand diplomatic service was similarly gradual. At first, New Zealand's foreign affairs were handled by the United Kingdom, and the only diplomacy conducted by the colonial government in New Zealand were negotiations with the British authorities. Relations between New Zealand and Britain were handled by an Agent-General in London, with the first being appointed in 1871. The title was changed to High Commissioner in 1905, reflecting the increasing autonomy of New Zealand. It was not until World War II, however, that New Zealand sent permanent diplomatic missions to other countries. To facilitate co-ordination of the war effort New Zealand established several posts in countries with which it was allied‚Äîthe first was a legation in the United States in 1941. In 1942 and 1943, high commissions were opened in Ottawa and Canberra respectively, and in 1944, a legation was established in the Soviet Union. The latter was considered a striking departure from New Zealand's previous diplomatic activities‚Äîenthusiasm for the post was strongest in the governing Labour Party, and the opposition National Party later made its closure one of their campaign policies. The opening of these posts prompted New Zealand to establish its own foreign ministry, the Department of External Affairs. Created by the External Affairs Act in June 1943, the new Department incorporated an older office of the same name (dealing with island territories) and those sections of the Prime Minister's office which had previously co-ordinated diplomacy. In 1947, a resident trade representative was appointed in Japan, followed by the establishment of legations in Paris (1949) and The Hague (1950). By the late 1950s, these three posts, along with Washington, had been upgraded to embassies --. However, fulfilling its promise the Moscow post was closed in 1950 by the new National Party government. From 1955 to 1961, a string of new missions opened in Asia‚ÄîSingapore, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Indonesia. When Samoa obtained its independence from New Zealand in 1962, it became the first Pacific Island state to host a New Zealand diplomatic post. The mid-1960s saw a cluster of new posts opening in Europe, with new missions in Belgium, Greece, Germany and Italy. A post was also opened in South Vietnam due to the ongoing conflict there, although this did not last beyond the end of the Vietnam War. A post was established in the Cook Islands after they obtained self-government from New Zealand, becoming New Zealand's second mission in the south Pacific. The 1970s and 1980s were a time of continued expansion for NZMFAT. In 1973, the Labour government of Norman Kirk reopened its embassy in the Soviet Union and opened an embassy in the People's Republic of China. However it was in the Pacific where New Zealand's representation rapidly expanded as several countries gained independence, including Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Tonga and Vanuatu. Frequently New Zealand was the first country to establish a mission in these states. New Zealand also expanded into the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and elsewhere in Asia. The early 1990s were a time of substantial reorganisation of New Zealand's diplomatic missions, and saw a number of closures. A substantial redistribution of New Zealand's European resources took place‚Äîposts in Greece and Austria were closed, while a new post was established in Spain. New Zealand's post in Iraq was closed due to the Gulf War, and the post in Bahrain was shut shortly afterwards‚Äîthe post in Saudi Arabia assumed most of their duties, aided by a new post in Turkey. The end of apartheid in resulted in a decision to move New Zealand's post in Zimbabwe to South Africa. In South America New Zealand's embassy in Peru was also closed, but missions were opened in Brazil and Argentina. In April 2008 it was announced that the budget for NZMFAT would be dramatically increased, and would include the opening of new missions in Stockholm and Brisbane. On 4 May 2010 the Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully announced that New Zealand's diplomatic relations with Afghanistan will be formally represented by the first resident ambassador to Kabul, retired Army Brigadier Neville Reilly. In addition the first Civil Director of the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in the central Afghan Province of Bamyan based in the Provincial Capital of Bamyan will be led by retired Air Commodore Dick Newlands of the Air Force. The Civil Director will replace the military aspects of the PRT with greater emphasis on civilian provided resources and services for the people of Bamyan.

He achieved success in a number of fields, including horseracing, the military and as a corporate chairman. Early life and baronetcy Clarke was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the son of Rupert Clarke, 2nd Baronet (a prominent pastoralist and Member of Parliament) and Elsie Tucker (born in Melbourne). His father purchased the Villa Les Abeilles in Monte Carlo and the young Rupert attended a French-speaking primary school. Upon his father's death on Christmas Day 1926, he succeeded as the 3rd Baronet of Rupertswood when he was only seven years old.Obituary: Sir Rupert Clarke, Bt, The Times, 15 February 2005. His mother remarried (to the Fifth Marquess of Headfort) and he moved to England. Rupert became an accomplished athlete at Eton and then later at Magdalen College, Oxford. He excelled at shooting, swimming, fencing and rowing, sometimes simultaneously. Scholastically he excelled, particularly in languages. He spent a considerable amount of time travelling through Germany with friends who would soon be on the opposing side during World War II. Military career By 1941 he had enlisted in the British Army and was commissioned in the Irish Guards, as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Harold Alexander. Clarke was present at various major turning points in the war, including the withdrawal from Burma, the North African Campaign against the German Afrika Korps and the Invasion of Sicily. As ADC to Alexander, he met Chiang Kai-shek and Pope Pius XII. He was created a Member of the Order of the British Empire Military division. In 2000, Sir Rupert wrote a book on his war adventures entitled With Alex at War ‚Äì From the Irrawaddy to the Po 1941-1945. Business interests Clarke returned to Australia and married Kathleen Grant Hay, daughter of successful Melbourne brewery owner, Peter Grant Hay. Following his appointment as a Director (his first of many) of the Richmond Brewery in 1950, Sir Rupert returned to England seeking introductions to inspect breweries. In early 1951 Sir Rupert and Lady Clarke visited King Ranch in Texas. Sir Rupert, asked the late Robert J. Kleberg, who had founded the Santa Gertrudis breed of cattle in the US, if he would consider a partnership venture to ship cattle to Australia for stud purposes. This approach eventually led to the formation of King Ranch Australia with Peter Baillieu, Sam Hordern and Sir Rupert being the Australian partners recommended to Bob Kleberg by the famous WS Robinson. Prior to the importation of King Ranch cattle Sir Rupert having sold his property \\"Kismet\\" at Sunbury, he purchased Marlborough Station in central Queensland and subsequently Carse O' Gowrie Station near Ravenswood, Queensland. Forty-five King Ranch Santa Gertrudis bulls arrived in Brisbane on 15 June 1952 but the remaining 27 bulls and 201 heifers were held up for more than nine weeks by a seaman's strike. They arrived in Melbourne around 27 August and after a month of quarantine at Coode Island, came to the family property \\"Bolinda Vale\\" to spend a further six weeks before being railed to Queensland. Five bulls, personally selected by Kleberg, were kept by Sir Rupert to establish his own stud herd. By 1974 the emphasis on pastoral development waned and towards the end of the 1980s the balance of the King Ranch properties in Australia was sold to Bankers Trust for around $100 million. Clarke became involved in horse racing, and was on the Victoria Amateur Turf Club (now the Melbourne Racing Club) for 40 years, nearly half that time as chairman. He was also chairman of Cadbury Schweppes Australia, and P&O; Australia, deputy chairman of the Distillers Group and the third generation of Clarke baronets to sit on the board of the National Australia Bank. He was also the Honorary Consul of Monaco. Sir Rupert was engaged in a variety of charitable works, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of this. After Clarke's first wife died in 1999, he married Gillian de Zoete in 2000. He died in 2005 at the age of 85, leaving three children and his second wife, Gillian de Zoete. His eldest son Rupert succeeded to the baronetcy as Fourth Baronet of Rupertswood. The baronetcy (originally awarded to Sir William Clarke by Queen Victoria in 1882), is only one of two now extant of Australian territorial designation, and the only such baronetcy held by an Australian-born citizen.Sir Rupert III may be last man standing, The Age, 18 March 2005.

(Cornelis van der Voort) Cornelis Pietersz. Hooft (1547 ‚Äì 1627 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch statesman. He was the grandson of Pieter Willemsz. Hooft, a Zaanse grain merchant and shipmaster, and the father of the poet and dramatist Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Hooft himself held numerous positions in the administration of Amsterdam. He was amongst others, schepen, twelve times mayor, and treasurer in a period of fast growth, so that the city had to be expanded three times. Cornelis' father established himself in Amsterdam. In 1569 he went into exile, but in 1574 came back from K√∂nigsberg and established himself in Hoorn. Then, in 1578, after the Alteratie on 26 May, he risked going back to Amsterdam. He lived on Nieuwendijk on the IJ. Hooft had been interested in theology, but was nevertheless tolerant - his wife Anna Jansdr Blaeu was a Mennonite, and he seems to have been a 'via media' man, declaring for neither the Remonstrants nor the Anti-Remonstrants. As an independent merchant he had a large share in Baltic trade and reshipped herring, oil and grain. In 1584 he became a member of the vroedschap, in which he remained until its final session. In 1588 he was chosen as mayor. As a member of the government of Amsterdam, he was delegated to the States of Holland and through them to the States General. Hooft was opposed to the appointment of foreigners to important posts, pointing to the Flemish Calvinists and preachers such as Petrus Plancius. He also resisted the expansion of the stadholder's power. Hooft was critical on other points. In 1611 his role in the vroedschap came to an end, when he was appointed as weesmeester and commissaris (commissioner) of the Wisselbank. Hooft was never concerned by the VOC or WIC, as the most Amsterdam mayors. Vondel praised him in his satirical work 'Roskam' as a reliable man and described him as \\"Hoofd vol kreuken, een geweten zonder rimpel\\" (a wrinkled brow, but a conscience without wrinkle). In 1618, stadholder Maurits of Orange, in his purge of Remonstrant regents from the vroedschap as a result of the Synod of Dort and the arrest of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, spared Hooft, who took a neutral stance. He is buried in the Oude Kerk. Sources *S.A.C.

The school was opened for the purpose of having a school for the children of leper patients. So since its establishment in 1936, the School was accepting only children of leper patients. Then in the mid-1950s, with the enactment of the Liberalization Law for Lepers, the doors of the school were opened to all. With this development, the School sought to identify what it is now for and what it hopes to achieve. In October 2015, the administrators, faculty and staff of the School convened to re-think and eventually formulate its new vision and mission. Beginning School Year 2016-2017, the Loyola College of Culion had a new vision and mission. History=Beginnings In 1936 the Sisters of St. Paul of Charters were running Hijas de Maria Dormitory for female lepers. Mother Superior Donatienne persuaded Jesuit Fr. Hugh J. McNulty to open en elementary school for the girls, originally in portions of their dormitory. In June 1939 the Philippine government recognized this first private educational institution in Culion, Palawan: Culion Catholic Primary School. With the outbreak of World War II, the school was forced to close in 1938. It reopened in 1948 as a co-educational grade school, called Culion Catholic School, remaining exclusively for those with leprosy. Then in the mid-1950s, with the enactment of the Liberalization Law for Lepers, the doors of the school were opened to all. In 1952 Fr. Walter Hamilton, S.J., responding to an expressed need for secondary education, opened St. Ignatius High School for graduates of the Culion Catholic School. After 3 years, Jesuit Fr. Pedro Dimaano merged the two schools into St. Ignatius Academy. The desire of the Jesuits for the educational development and spiritual uplifting of the people in the area around Culion gave rise to the only private college in the area. In 1985, under Director Fr. John Chambers, S.J., the school initiated a Bachelor of Arts in Literature and it became St. Ignatius College. which in 1988 was changed to Loyola College of Culion. Current situation Although leprosy in Culion has been eradicated, the stigma remains. The small municipality is poor and mostly dependent on fishing and farming. Loyola College of Culion continues to help finance education for Culion and its surrounding islands and municipalities. In 2008-2009 the college numbered 554 students (262 in grade school, 218 in high school, and 74 in college). The school's survival depends on subsidies from various agencies, including the Society of Jesus and various agencies offering scholarships. Until May 2009 ANESVAD supplied 60% of the funding but that was discontinued and funds are being sought from other sources. The local government has been developing the area for tourism based on its beaches and diving prospects. It also is interested, through education, in protecting the people from abuse of their dignity, and in preserving their heritage as a people.

Joyce was born in 1910 at Hawthorn, Melbourne, and educated at Scotch College, Hawthorn. On leaving education he was employed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd but, finding himself unsuited to that work, he performed in amateur theatricals in Melbourne and was stage manager for several productions of the Little Theatre Company. In 1932 Joyce entered commercial radio, working in various stations across Australia, and eventually rising to station manager. He could not enlist during World War II because of a childhood injury, so instead he served as an air-raid warden. At this time he wrote a regular and occasionally controversial column in Radio Times under the pseudonym 'Slapper'. He formed Donovan Joyce Productions in 1945. For his new company he wrote and commissioned dramas and documentaries for radio, many of which he exported, particularly to South Africa, where he also advised on local radio production. Although Joyce wrote the script for a television episode of Homicide in 1966, he never adapted to writing for the small screen. Joyce traveled to Israel in 1964 to visit Masada in order to write a book about it. Joyce claimed that he was prevented by Yigael Yadin from visiting the archaeological digs at Masada. In his book The Jesus Scroll, Joyce claimed he met someone who had discovered a scroll at Masada. The scroll was allegedly written on 15 April 73 AD and signed by \\"Yeshua Ben Ya'akob Ben Gennesareth, the last rightful inheritor of the Hasmonean (Maccabean) Kings of Israel\\" ‚Äì this is interpreted as Jesus of Gennesareth in this book. After a brief return to radio in Australia, he published The Jesus Scroll (Sydney, 1972; London, 1973), an original account of the life of Christ that became a best-seller and led to controversy and death threats. Joyce died of hypertensive heart disease on 16 October 1980, aged 69, at Prahran in Australia and was cremated. He was survived by his wife and a son.

The captain of the Carl, Joseph Armstrong, was later sentenced to death for his involvement in the massacre of islanders during the earlier 1871 voyage of the Carl. Upon returning the Fiji Watson was charged with piracy in respect of the second voyage of the Carl, but was later discharged from bail. Career right Watson met Baron Ferdinand von Mueller and was advised to take up a scientific career, Watson went to Europe to study medicine, obtaining the degrees of M.D., University of G√∂ttingen, M.D., University of Paris, and F.R.C.S., England. After doing post-graduate work at Paris he was for some time demonstrator of anatomy to Professor J. Cantlie at the Charing Cross Hospital medical school. In 1883 he went to Egypt as surgeon with Hicks Pasha's Sudan force, and in 1885 became first Elder professor of anatomy at the newly founded medical school at Adelaide. He taught also pathology (showing an early interest in biological means of controlling the rabbit pest), surgical anatomy, and operative surgery. He held this position for 34 years. During this time, he was also responsible for the collection of human remains of Indigenous Australians, some of which were shipped to overseas institutions. (In the 21st century, the Museum started pursuing an active policy of repatriation and reburial of these remains.) During the Boer war he was consulting-surgeon for the Natal field force. When World War I broke out in 1914, though 65 years of age, Watson left Australia with the first expeditionary force as a major in the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps and became consulting-surgeon and pathologist to No. 1 Australian Stationary Hospital at Heliopolis in Egypt. He returned to Australia in 1916. Watson visited China, South America, Japan, Russia and New Zealand, where he usually watched leading surgeons perform operations; although he regarded Sydney's Sir Alexander MacCormick as superior. Late life Watson resigned his university chair at the end of 1919 and spent many years travelling, visiting places as far apart as Iceland and the Falkland Islands. He journeyed round Australia gathering marine specimens and fishing. The 'Archibald Watson Prize' at the University of Adelaide was founded by public subscription in 1935. For the last two years of his life, he lived on Thursday Island where died on 30 July 1940, three days after turning 91. He was unmarried. He is commemorated by a memorial lecture at the invitation of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. His portrait (by William Beckwith McInnes) hangs in the Adelaide University's anatomy department.

It is a non-stock and non-profit institution duly accredited by the Philippine Council for NGO Certification (PCNC). It is also recognized by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) with Level 2 accreditation. Ateneo de Iloilo began in 1958 as a parochial school named Santa Maria Catholic School. In 2004, the school was officially recognized as a Jesuit school separate from the Santa Maria Parish and was renamed Ateneo de Iloilo - Santa Maria Catholic School. It is the eighth Jesuit school in the Philippines to be named Ateneo. Ateneo de Iloilo is a K-12 school and its curriculum includes Chinese language, Christian Living Education, and Ignatian Spirituality programs. It is known for its excellence in the fields of academics and values formation. The Ateneo de Manila University Graduate School of Business has a satellite school in Iloilo. It is located in Ateneo de Iloilo's San Rafael Campus. The presence of this graduate school is a trial balloon of Ateneo de Iloilo's plan to become a higher education institution in the future and to eventually become a university. History=Early years The Jesuits came to Iloilo City in 1953 after being expelled from China by the Communists, and continued their apostolic work in the local Chinese community. They first did parish-pastoral ministry. With the support of the Iloilo Chinese and Filipino communities, Santa Maria Parish under the tutelage of Our Lady Queen of China was established by Fr. Guerrino Marsecano, an Italian Jesuit missionary. Jesuits believe that quality education is essential in molding good Catholic Christians. So in 1958, with nine students as enrollees, Fr. Andrew Joliet, a French Jesuit, and Fr. Santiago Leon, a Spanish Jesuit, acting as Founder/Director and Principal respectively, opened a parochial school that was named Sta. Maria Catholic School (SMCS). A year after the founding of the school, a two-story wooden building was constructed to provide the students with eight classrooms. In 1962, through the beneficence of Eduardo and Cesar Lopez, additional classrooms were built on the brothers' lot situated across the street. SMCS had its first batch of graduates from the Grade School Department in school year 1965‚Äì66. The school accepted its first batch of high school freshmen in school year 1966‚Äì67. SMCS held its first high school graduation in March 1970. In 1968, the Philippine government recognized SMCS as a Filipino school with a comprehensive Chinese language program. From nine pupils in 1958, SMCS's student population had continuously grown. It accepted a total of 615 enrollees for high school alone in 1970. However, due to the decision of the Chinese Provincial superior to maintain only an elementary school, no freshmen were accepted for the school year 1971‚Äì72. As a result, high school enrollment plummeted to 513 and to 481 the following year. When parents of the students protested the phasing-out of the high school department, the Chinese Provincial Superior reconsidered his decision. A year after, enrollment started picking up as freshmen were again allowed to enroll for the school year 1972‚Äì73. Meanwhile, a donation of 3,600 square meters of land by the Lopez family in June 1972 paved the way for the construction of a four-story concrete building in 1974 to replace the wooden one. The French-German missionary Fr. Arthur Baur, S.J., parish priest and Superior of the Sta. Maria community, added a new wing to the school in 1977. Despite the limitations of a constricted space, SMCS's complex continued to grow under the tenure of Fr. John Chi, SJ. When SMCS celebrated its 25th founding anniversary in 1983, improvements such as the construction of additional comfort rooms, large classrooms, and a cluster of offices were undertaken. A two-story structure was also put up to house classrooms for kindergarten pupils. Two years later, administrative offices on the ground floor of the school were renovated and a conference room was added. The integration of the Jesuits of the China Province delegation in the Philippines into the Jesuit Philippine Province on September 27, 1988, resulted in all the former delegation works being placed under the care and control of the Philippine Jesuit provincial superior. This facilitated the assignment of Filipino Jesuits to the three Chinese-Filipino schools run by Jesuits: the Santa Maria Catholic School (Iloilo), Sacred Heart School‚ÄìAteneo de Cebu, and Xavier School (San Juan, Metro Manila). Name change With the incessant clamor of SMCS alumni and the local Iloilo community to let their children study in a Jesuit school, a plan for expansion and transfer to a new and better site was initiated. On April 30, 2004, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed by Jesuit Father Provincial Romeo J. Intengan, S.J., Fr. Manuel A. Uy Jr., S.J., Director of SMCS, and Victor F. Pison of the Kauuturan Pison Development Corporation (KAPIDECO). The latter was donating 2.5 hectares of land to be part of the 7.5-hectare campus of a new Ateneo, the first in the Visayas. Archbishop Angel Lagdameo of the Archdiocese of Jaro and Iloilo City Mayor Jerry P. Tre√±as, an Ateneo de Manila alumnus, witnessed the MOA signing which formalized the establishment of the Ateneo de Iloilo ‚Äì Santa Maria Catholic School, a Jesuit school separate from the parish. The new school campus is on a 7.5-hectare property in Barangay San Rafael, Mandurriao District, Iloilo City. This site is the main campus of the school. Buildings for the preschool, grade school, high school, and administration were constructed in this new campus, along with a covered gymnasium, sports complex, and church. Phase 1 of the master plan of the new campus was completed and the High School Department transferred to the new site in June 2010. Groundbreaking rites for the construction of a four-story building (Phase 2) worth P200 million for the use of the Grade School Department and the Administration were held on June 1, 2013. Construction of the Grade School and Administration buildings (Phase 2) began in late 2013. It was opened for Preschool and Grades 1‚Äì2 in 2016 and became fully operational in the school year after. The school has totally transferred to the new site in Barangay San Rafael, Mandurriao District, Iloilo City, in 2017, with 2,100 students and 200 faculty and staff. The old campus at General Blanco Street is now being used as a center for evangelization and pastoral activities by the Jesuits. This school year 2018‚Äì2019 marks the school's Golden Anniversary with a theme: 60 years of forming leaders ignited by love and service. Ateneo Graduate School of Business - Iloilo Housed at the main campus in Mandurriao District is the Ateneo de Manila University Graduate School of Business - Iloilo.Ateneo de Manila Graduate School of Business - Iloilo Campus. Retrieved August 14, 2020.When the school opened, it initially offered only one academic degree - Master of Business Administration (MBA) - Regis Program. It is an initial part of Ateneo de Iloilo's plan to offer tertiary courses through the Ateneo Graduate School of Business to become a higher education institution and eventually a university in the near future.

Logo 250px Santa Maria Catholic School The logo has multiple parts. The shield colors represents the Philippine flag. The blue band on top has the capital letters \\"AM\\" (Ave Maria). The lower two-thirds of the shield contains the lobo y olla (\\"wolf and pot\\" in Spanish), of the House of Loyola, and a stone fort for the emblem of the city of Iloilo. Above the shield is a gold medallion with the letters IHS. On both sides of the shield in gold are the Chinese characters ËÅñÊØç (pinyin: Sh√®ngm«î) which means Blessed Mother. The entire seal is enclosed in a circle composed of two semicircular scrolls: The upper scroll contains the current official name of the school and The lower scroll contains the name of the school since its foundation. Mascot The \\"Blue Dragon\\" is the mascot of the Ateneo de Iloilo - Santa Maria Catholic School. It combines the valor of the Chinese dragon with the color of the school's patroness, Mary, under the title of Our Lady of China. Ateneo name The name Ateneo is the Spanish form of the Latin name Athenaeum, which the dictionary of Classical Antiquities defines as the name of \\"the first educational institution in Rome\\" where \\"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, was where \\"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\\" Athenaeum is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning. The Ateneo de Iloilo is not the only Jesuit school in the Philippines named Ateneo. The Society of Jesus has established sixteen schools all over the Philippines since 1590. Nine of them were given the name Ateneo. Ateneo de Iloilo was the eight school named Ateneo. Over the years, the name \\"Ateneo\\" has become synonymous with academic excellence. PAASCU accreditation During the five-year term (1991‚Äì1996) of Fr. Renato Puentevella, S.J, as Director - Principal, SMCS went through the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU) Preliminary Survey and Formal Survey. The Grade School Department was granted a three-year PAASCU accreditation in 1995 and the High School Department followed suit the following year. SMCS applied for PAASCU re-accreditation in November 1999 and was granted accreditation for another five years. In November 2004, PAASCU conducted a resurvey visit. Both the Grade School and High School Departments were granted re-accreditation for 2005‚Äì2010. Similar accreditation was granted to the school for 2010‚Äì2015 and for 2016‚Äì2021. It is set for another PAASCU re-accreditation on February, 2022.

The first series premiered at on SBS TV on 10 October 2007 and concluded on 3 December 2007. A second season began on 27 February 2008. and concluded on 30 April 2008. A third season of the show screened from 1 October to 3 December 2008.. The show was developed by Micallef, Gary McCaffrie, Michael Ward and Jason Stephens, with McCaffrie and Ward working as writers on the programme. A fourth series in 2009 was planned, but cancelled due to production clashes with Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation. The show's contributors include Matt Cameron, Doug MacLeod, Dave O'Neil, Tony Moclair and Richard Marsland. Format The show was presented in the style of a news bulletin, with Shaun Micallef acting as anchor. It began with a statement by Micallef about history and/or news and its relation to the show. The rest of the program featured segments often detailing factual events, but told from a humorous or satirical angle. Like much of Micallef's earlier work, the humour depicted was mostly surreal, with some social satire. The program included several fictional advertisements placed throughout the real commercial breaks, dressed up to appear as authentic commercials for SBS programs, for example, Inspektor Herring, a parody of Inspector Rex. Because the commercials were fictional creations of Newstopia, for the first two seasons, SBS broadcast them with the SBS watermark at the bottom right corner, whereas genuine commercials did not show the watermark. Starting in the third season, the show removed the SBS watermark during the fictional advertisements. The show also featured subliminal parodies of Pope Benedict XVI in which his image was replaced with one of Nosferatu, long enough to be noticed, but not long enough for the viewer to have a clear idea of what they had just seen.

Police investigation  On 9 June 1980 preliminary investigations of the disappearances began. Inquiries were conducted over the following 12 months with friends and associates of Louise.  Coronial inquest  In August 2006 a coronial inquest was held into the disappearance and death of Louise and Charmian Faulkner and found that the pair were probably murdered. The inquest was re-convened in 2008. On that occasion the coroner ruled the deaths foul play, but said there was not enough evidence to link anyone to the killings.Australian Broadcasting Corporation (18 March 2008). \\"Missing pair's death ruled 'foul play'\\".

Biography Grave of Carr and his wife Laurie Carr was born in Ponsonby, Auckland in 1886. His father was the Rev. Thomas Goodwill Carr (died 1935). Carr was educated at Nelson College from 1899 to 1902.Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856‚Äì2006, 6th edition Ordained as a minister in 1915, he was on the Christchurch City Council between 1923 and 1927 and the Hospital Board in the 1920s, after working in commerce and banking. Carr was also committed to animal welfare and in April 1936 he was elected to the office of President of the federated Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Carr joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s. He unsuccessfully sought the Labour nomination in the in the , , and electorates. He moved to Timaru to contest the in the electorate; he had no prior family or other connection to this provincial town. His 1928 election win was an unexpected upset, ousting the popular local lawyer Frank Rolleston, who was Attorney-General, Minister of Justice, and Minister of Defence at the time. Rolleston was the son of William Rolleston, one of the most influential politicians of the 19th century in Canterbury. Carr represented the Timaru electorate from 1928 to 1962, when he resigned. His long representation of the electorate is unique in that a provincial town was not a safe Labour seat, and he had no prior relation with the people of Timaru before moving there to contest the 1928 election. He was a dissident, getting three votes when he ran against Peter Fraser for Labour's leadership in 1940 to replace Savage as party leader. He was not appointed to any ministerial positions, but was Chairman of Committees (1947‚Äì1949) and Deputy Speaker (1946‚Äì1950). He was Vice-President of the Labour Party (1933‚Äì1934) and President (1936‚Äì1937). Carr was widely read, and could assist the whips if the party was caught ‚Äúon the hop‚Äù by speaking for his full-time while the party reorganised. He had a struggle to exist on his Parliamentary salary (¬£7 or $14 a week when he entered the house in 1928) and also contribute to local raffles and fundraisers. To save money he lived in his office, sleeping on a day-bed, although Nash tried to ban this for a time. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. His wife died in April 1961 and he moved back to Christchurch soon after. He resigned from Parliament on 31 May 1962, and died on 18 September 1962.

It was established in 1955 with a curriculum that includes a Chinese language course. On 4 March 2010, the Board of Trustees of the Sacred Heart School unanimously approved the changing of the school's official name to Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Ateneo de Cebu. Previously, its name was Sacred Heart School of the Society of Jesus or Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Jesuit (SHS-J). After its renaming, SHS-AdC became the ninth Jesuit school in the Philippines to bear the prestigious Ateneo name. Aside from providing academic excellence, Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Ateneo de Cebu also serves as a bridge between the Filipino and Chinese Filipino communities through Christian education that accepts not only Chinese Filipinos but also students who have no Chinese roots. History In 1953, Fr. Paul O'Brien, SJ then the superior of all Jesuits belonging to the former missions in China, was approached by the Catholic Chinese-Filipino community of Cebu City regarding the possibility of establishing a school that has a Chinese language program in its curriculum for the education of their children. Once approval was secured from the Superior General of the Jesuits in Rome, the school initially operated as an affiliate of the Colegio de San Jose-Recoletos. The administration of San Jose-Recoletos generously provided it with their Principal and a contingent of lay faculty members. In 1955, Sacred Heart School was officially established as an independent school, built along General Maxilom Avenue, Barangay Lorega San Miguel, Cebu City, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Heras, S.J., one of the Jesuits expelled from Communist China, as its first rector and school head. The school was then an all-male institution. On 25 February 1965, Sacred Heart School became a Filipino school, approved by the Bureau of Education to teach the regular curriculum prescribed by the government with a Chinese Language and Arts program. The integration of the Jesuits of the China Province delegation in the Philippines into the Jesuit Philippine Province on 27 September 1988 resulted in all the former delegation works being placed under the care and control of the Philippine Jesuit provincial superior. This facilitated the assignment of Filipino Jesuits to the three Chinese-Filipino schools run by the Jesuits: the Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Ateneo de Cebu (Cebu), Ateneo de Iloilo ‚Äì Santa Maria Catholic School (Iloilo), and Xavier School (San Juan, Metro Manila). Originally called Sacred Heart School for Boys, the name of the school was officially changed to Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Jesuit (SHS-J) in 2000. That school year (2000-2001), SHS-J began accepting girls in the Grade School Department, and in 2006 produced its first batch of graduates with female students.

The student population of SHS-J began to grow after becoming coeducational. The original campus, located along General Maxilom Avenue, Barangay Lorega San Miguel, Cebu City, became inadequate. The school transferred to a more modern and larger campus along H. Abellana Street, Barangay Canduman, Mandaue City, Cebu, in 2007. On August 24, 2008, the new campus was solemnly blessed by Cebu Archbishop Ricardo J. Cardinal Vidal, in the presence of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Very Rev. Fr. Jose Cecilio Magadia (Provincial of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus), Jesuit priests, benefactors, notable alumni, and local government leaders. New horizon On 4 March 2010, the Board of Trustees of the Sacred Heart School approved the changing of the school's name to Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Ateneo de Cebu.Sacred Heart School - Ateneo de Cebu On 12 December 2018, the newest building, Cor Iesu Oratory, was solemnly inaugurated and blessed by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Very Rev. Fr. Arturo Sosa, S.J, coinciding with his pastoral visit to the Philippines. This new prayer venue is a product of collaboration of multi-awarded industrial designer Kenneth Cobonpue, Buck Richnold Sia and Zubu Design Associates, Bryant Auman, consultant on the use of bamboo, and Veepee Pinpin, a liturgical architecture consultant. In July 2019, this building became part of the shortlist (finalist) of the Completed Buildings ‚Äì Religion category of the World Architecture Festival.  K to 12 program  In 2015, the Department of Education of the Philippines (DepEd) announced that an extra two years of schooling will be required from every student in the Philippines. This campaign, known commonly as the K to 12 Program or simply K-12, would standardize Philippine education, thus turning secondary or high school education in the Philippines into a period of six years, as prior to this, Philippine high school only lasted four school years. Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Ateneo de Cebu adapted to the change by launching its Senior High School Program, a program which accommodates both eleventh and twelfth grade students. It began the construction of a new Senior High School building solely for the eleventh and twelfth grade levels, which was completed in May 2016. Sports program The school is known for its multi sports program and is a member of the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation (CESAFI), an athletic organization composed of schools in the province of Cebu. It has varsity teams in the following sports: basketball, football, volleyball, badminton, chess, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, track and field, archery and tennis. Teams which represent the school in inter-school tournaments are called by the name Magis Eagles. Accreditation and affiliations Sacred Heart School's High School Department was accredited in 1974 by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The Grade School Department was accredited in 1976. Both Departments have been re-accredited every five years. Sacred Heart School ‚Äì Ateneo de Cebu is a member of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), Private Education Retirement Annuity Association (PERAA), Association for Non- Traditional Education in the Philippines (ANTEP), Jesuit Education Association (JEA), and Jesuit Basic Education Commission (JBEC).

Berlin 2011, p. 115. He was the son of Talmi-Teshub, who was both the last viceroy of the Hittite Empire at Carchemish under Suppiluliuma II and a direct descendant of Suppiluliuma I. Kuzi-Teshub reigned in Carchemish as well as in the later Neo-Hittite city of Melid. In Carchemish, Kuzi-Teshub succeeded his father in office, probably first as viceroy, according to royal seal impressions found at Lidar H√∂y√ºk in 1985 on the east bank of the Euphrates river. Kuzi-Teshub then styled himself as Great King of Carchemish, suggesting that the central Hittite dynasty at Hattusa had collapsed by this time and that he viewed himself as the legitimate heir of the line of Suppiluliuma I. Kuzi-Teshub is also styled as Great King in later inscriptions from Melid. The next known Great King of Carchemish was Ir-Teshub. Kuzi-Teshub is not proved to have ruled directly as King of Melid. On one hand, it is possible that he ruled directly in Melid, but on the other hand he may have installed his son Pugnus-mili I as the local ruler in Melid. Both Kuzi-Teshub and Pugnus-mili I are only known from inscriptions left by the autonomous kings of Melid, Runtiya and Arnuwanti I, who were sons of Pugnus-mili I and grandsons of Kuzi-Teshub. The references to Kuzi-Teshub in his grandsons' inscriptions may indicate that Melid had peacefully separated from Carchemish.

The state highway runs from Olivers Shop Road near Hughesville east to MD 765 in Prince Frederick. MD 231 crosses the Patuxent River on the Benedict Bridge, which connects Benedict in eastern Charles County with Hallowing Point in central Calvert County. The highway directly connects MD 5 in Hughesville with MD 2 and MD 4 in Prince Frederick. MD 231 was constructed from Hughesville to Benedict and from Hollowing Point to Prince Frederick in the early 1920s. The portion of the state highway west of Hughesville was built in the early 1930s, about the same time ferry service began between Benedict and Hallowing Point. The Benedict Bridge was started in 1950 and was completed in 1952; the bridge remained the southernmost crossing of the Patuxent River for 25 years. The bridge was tolled from its opening until around 1955. MD 231 was reconstructed between Hughesville and Prince Frederick in the mid- to late 1950s to better serve intercounty traffic. It has been suggested that the portion of MD 231 west of Hughesville be transferred to county maintenance. Route description MD 231 begins at an intersection with Olivers Shop Road in the hamlet of Burnt Store in eastern Charles County. Olivers Shop Road connects Dentsville to the south with Bryantown to the north. MD 231 heads east as two- lane undivided Burnt Store Road, crossing Gilbert Creek on its way to Hughesville. Within Hughesville, the state highway intersects MD 5 Business (Old Leonardtown Road), where the highway's name changes to Prince Frederick Road. East of the village center, MD 231 meets MD 5 (Leonardtown Road) at a dumbbell interchange. In the hamlet of Patuxent, the state highway intersects MD 381 (Brandywine Road), which heads north into the southeastern corner of Prince George's County. From Patuxent, MD 231 heads southeast through the neck of far eastern Charles County that reaches to the Patuxent River between Prince George's County and St. Mary's County. Before reaching the river, the state highway passes to the north of the village of Benedict, which was the site of the landing of British troops to march toward Washington prior to the Battle of Bladensburg during the War of 1812. The state highway crosses the Patuxent River on the Benedict Bridge, a long steel beam bridge whose roadway is wide. At the Patuxent River's navigation channel, the bridge features a through steel girder swing span that has vertical clearance when closed and provides two openings with horizontal clearance when opened. View east along MD 231 in Barstow MD 231 enters Calvert County at Hallowing Point and continues east as Hallowing Point Road, passing an industrial park and Hallowing Point Park. After intersecting MD 508 (Adelina Road), the state highway veers northeast through the village of Barstow, where the highway passes west of a park and ride lot and the Calvert County Fairgrounds before it intersects Barstow Road, which serves the historic homes Cedar Hill and Willow Glenn. MD 231 passes the Prince Frederick campus of the College of Southern Maryland before entering Prince Frederick. The state highway meets MD 2 and MD 4, which run concurrently as Solomons Island Road, on the west side of the county seat. MD 231 continues northeast as Church Street, passing the historic home Linden, home of the Calvert County Historical Society. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 765 (Main Street), a short distance north of the county courthouse. MD 231 is a part of the main National Highway System from MD 5 in Hughesville to MD 2 and MD 4 in Prince Frederick. History The Prince Frederick Road portion of MD 231, originally named Benedict Road, was constructed as a gravel road by 1921. The Hallowing Point Road section was built in gravel around 1923. Burnt Store Road was constructed of gravel starting in 1930 and was completed by 1933. At MD 231's western terminus, Olivers Shop Road was originally MD 232, which ran from MD 234 at Wicomico north to what was then MD 233 (Woodville Road) north of Bryantown. MD 232 was removed from the state highway system around 1989, leaving MD 231's western terminus at a county highway. Westbound on the Benedict Bridge over the Patuxent River looking toward BenedictFerry service began between Benedict and Hallowing Point began around 1933. On the west side of the Patuxent River, MD 231 originally turned south into the village of Benedict, following Benedict Avenue to the ferry terminal where the avenue starting following the riverbank. The Hallowing Point terminal remains today as a boat ramp immediately south of the bridge. State senator Louis L. Goldstein of Calvert County sponsored a bill to construct a bridge between Benedict and Hallowing Point. In order to get enough votes to pass, the bridge bill stipulated the bridge would have a 25-cent toll. Work on the Benedict Bridge began in May 1950. The toll plaza and administration building were completed on the Calvert County side of the bridge in autumn 1951. The bridge itself and wide gravel approach roads on both sides of the river were completed and opened in spring 1952. The toll was removed from the bridge in 1955 due to very low traffic; a daily average of 237 vehicles used the bridge in its first year. By comparison, the bridge had an average annual daily traffic figure of 12,312 vehicles in 2013. The completion of the Benedict Bridge greatly improved the connection between Calvert County and both Charles and St. Mary's counties. Prior to 1952, the southernmost bridge on the Patuxent River had been Hills Bridge, by which MD 4 crosses the river at Upper Marlboro. By 1953, MD 231 between MD 5 in Hughesville and MD 2 in Prince Frederick was marked as a \\"main highway\\" on the state highway map. Reconstruction of MD 231 between MD 5 and MD 2 began in 1954. In both counties, the road was resurfaced in two stages: a first stage of bituminous stabilized gravel and a second stage of bituminous concrete. The reconstruction of MD 231 was completed from Prince Frederick to Hallowing Point in 1956 and from Hughesville to Benedict by 1958. The Benedict Bridge remained the southernmost crossing of the Patuxent River until the opening of the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge between Solomons at the bottom of Calvert County and California in St. Mary's County in 1978. The \\"functionally obsolete\\" bridge underwent major repairs in 2002, during which the bridge was reduced to one lane of traffic in alternating directions.

He was raised to the baronetage in 1882, the first Victorian to be granted a hereditary honour. Clarke was born in Van Diemen's Land, the son of the pastoralist William John Turner Clarke. He arrived in the Port Phillip District (the future Victoria) in 1850, where he managed many of his father's properties and acquired some of his own. Upon his father's death in 1874, he became the largest landowner in the colony. Clarke was made a baronet for his work as the head of the Melbourne International Exhibition, which brought Australia to international attention. He also served terms as president of the Australian Club, president of the Victorian Football Association, and president of the Melbourne Cricket Club, and was prominent in yachting and horse racing circles. Clarke gave generously to charitable organisations, and also made significant financial contributions to the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and the University of Melbourne. He was a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1878 until 1897, although he was not particularly active in politics. Early life Clarke was born at Lovely Banks (one of his father's properties, near Jericho) in Van Diemen's Land (later renamed Tasmania), the eldest of three sons of William John Turner Clarke and his wife Eliza (n√©e Dowling). Clarke senior was an early Tasmanian colonist, who acquired large pastoral properties in Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and New Zealand and settled afterwards in Victoria at Rupertswood, Sunbury. Clarke first arrived in Victoria in 1850, when he spent a couple of years in the study of sheep farming on his father's Dowling Forest station, and afterwards in the management of the Woodlands station on the Wimmera. For the next ten years he resided in Tasmania, working the Norton-Mandeville estate in conjunction with his brother, Joseph Clarke. Career Clarke laid the foundation stone for the Metropolitan Meat Market in February 1880 Clarke took some interest in local government and was chairman of the Braybrook Road Board. On the death of his father he found himself with a very large income, much of which he began to use for the benefit of the state. His largest gifts were ¬£10,000 for the building fund of St Paul's cathedral and ¬£7000 for Trinity College, Melbourne University. In 1862 Clarke stood against George Higinbotham in the Brighton by-election for the Victorian Legislative Assembly, but was not elected. He was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for the Southern Province in September 1878, but never took a prominent part in politics. In 1862 Clarke assumed the management of his father's concerns in Victoria, and on the latter's death in 1874 succeeded to his estates in that colony. In the same year he was appointed president of the commissioners of the Melbourne international exhibition which was opened on 1 October 1880. In 1882 he gave 3000 guineas to found a scholarship in the Royal College of Music. For many years Clarke bore the full expense of the Rupertswood battery of horse artillery at Sunbury, Victoria. Amongst Sir William Clarke's other public donations are the gift of ¬£2000 to the Indian Famine Relief Fund, of ¬£10,000 towards building the Anglican Cathedral at Melbourne, and of ¬£7000 to Trinity College, Melbourne University. Clarke also took interest in various forms of sport, his yacht, the Janet, won several races, but he was not very successful on the turf; the most important race he won being the V.R.C. Oaks. He was the inaugural president of the Victorian Football Association, presiding from 1877 until 1882. He was the patron of many agricultural societies and did much to improve the breed of cattle in Victoria. Before the Victorian department of agriculture was established he provided a laboratory for Ralph Waldo Emerson MacIvor, and paid him to lecture on agricultural chemistry in farming centres. In 1886, he was a member of the Victorian commission to the Colonial and Indian exhibition, and in the same year Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of LL.D. Clarke was a very prominent Victorian Freemason and was elected provincial grand master of the Irish Constitution in 1881 and then district grand master of both the Scottish and English Constitutions in 1884. In 1889 he became the very first Most Worshipful Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of Victoria, an amalgamation of the three bodies that had operated at that time under their own constitutions. In 1885 he had largely financed the building of the Freemasons' Hall at 25 Collins Street. Later life In Clarke's later years, although his interests lay principally in the country, he lived at his town house Cliveden in East Melbourne. He died suddenly at Melbourne on 15 May 1897. He was created a baronet in 1882, by Queen Victoria in recognition for his many donations and for his presiding over the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880. He married twice, firstly in 1860 to Mary Walker, daughter of the Tasmanian businessman and politician John Walker. He was widowed in April 1871, and in January 1873 remarried to Janet Marian Snodgrass, the daughter of the Victorian pastoralist and politician Peter Snodgrass. He had two sons and two daughters by his first wife, and another four sons and four daughters by his second; he was survived by Janet and nine of his children. Clarke was a household name in Victoria. He made a few large donations but his help could constantly be relied on by hospitals, charitable institutions, and agricultural and other societies. He divided one of his estates into small holdings and was a model landlord, and he showed much foresight in allying science with agriculture by employing MacIvor as a lecturer. His second wife, Janet, who had been associated with him in philanthropic movements, kept up her interest in them, especially in all matters relating to women, until her death on 28 April 1909. One of their sons, Sir Francis Grenville Clarke, went into politics and was a member of several Victorian ministries. He became president of the Legislative Council in 1923 and held that position for almost 20 years and was created K.B.E. in 1926. His son Rupert succeeded him as the 2nd Baronet. The baronetcy of Clarke of Rupertswood is one of only two active hereditary titles in an Australian family. His second son, Ernest Edward Dowling Clarke (1869‚Äì1941), was a noted racehorse owner, closely associated with trainer James Scobie.

Early life and education Jacqueline Mary Clarke was born in Clonmel Road, Fulham, West London, the first child and only daughter of Hugh Clarke (1892‚Äì1930), a toolmaker, and Lillie Nunns (1890‚Äì1980), the daughter of a railway guard, Harry Nunns, and his wife Elizabeth. Her father, whom she remembered despite his death when she was six years old, told her \\"with absolute certainty\\" that she would be a writer. She was educated at Carlyle School, Chelsea. When the school was evacuated to Windsor at the beginning of World War II, she absconded back to London several times, by bicycle, and was eventually expelled. Throughout the war she lived in Ealing with her mother, working first for Hoover and then for the local council. She joined the Labour Party and in 1945 was the East Ealing Labour Party delegate to the party conference. In a letter written shortly before her death she wrote that her life \\"started with an arrival, inauspicious, at the LSE London School of Economics\\".Letter published in The Times. Actually she had been discovered by Professor Harold Laski when she asked him to talk at the Ealing branch of the Labour League of Youth. Laski invited her to come and work in the Machine Room as a secretary to the Statistics Department at the LSE for two years, and in 1948 she was admitted to the school. Laski's successor was Michael Oakeshott, whose profound influence on Wheldon's politics expressed itself gradually over the years. Her political activism, great in youth, and to be resurgent in later life, was to be subsumed in literary endeavour. While Laski's desire \\"to share what is most dignified in human nature\\"J. Abse, (ed.) My LSE (1977), pp. 128‚Äì144 was the reason Wheldon had arrived at LSE, one of her own observations once there was that \\"it is not the case that the elite possess the works, but that the works possess the elite... The elite as I met it at LSE was at my service; there would have been no 'beauties' of Plato, Rousseau, Hobbes for me to have 'a sight' of, if generations of individuals whom these writers had come to 'possess' had not submitted to serve and to keep these works intact and ever re-creative and re-created.\\" Now, studying part-time, it was work during the day, lectures in the evening and the Labour Party increasingly on the side. She received high marks for an essay on economic history and was encouraged to expand it and put it in for a State Scholarship for Mature Students, which she received. She became a full-time student at the age of 26. Michael Oakeshott undertook the whole course on the history of political thought. She later wrote that \\"the first book I really read in my life, ignoring all introductions, prefaces, commentaries, was Cornford's translation of The Republic\\". Wheldon gained an Upper Second and left LSE in 1954 to start research at the Nuffield Foundation in Cambridge with Dr Hilde Himmelweit on the book Television and the Child. In Cambridge she made a number of lifelong friends to whom she was introduced by Norman Podhoretz (whom she had met on a holiday in Greece in 1951, and who later became editor of the American intellectual monthly Commentary), including novelist Dan Jacobson and chemist Aaron Klug (who won the Nobel Prize in 1982). F. R. Leavis still held court at Downing College, and the students of English were in his thrall. Through them Wheldon was introduced to The Novel. She \\"read enormously... came alive in a curious kind of way\\".R. Martin, ‚ÄòRuth Martin Meets Jacqueline Wheldon‚Äô, The Bookseller (February 1966) In 1955 Wheldon applied successfully for a post in the Cabinet Office, and was at the same time asked to become an officer in the Joint Intelligence Bureau at the Ministry of Defence. She turned down both positions, probably due to her marriage to the broadcaster Huw Wheldon. They were married at St John's Church, Fulham, on 2 April 1956. It was to be a marriage of intense mutual dependence and uninterrupted loving kindness. In June 1957 she returned to LSE to resume a PhD on 19th century political thought, but it was never finished and perhaps hardly truly begun, for by July she was pregnant with her first child. Writer Wheldon had begun to contribute articles on television to such journals as Truth and Context, but she had begun to work on a novel that, following the birth of two further children, was to grow by 1964 to well over 400,000 words (she trimmed it to 220,000 for publication). Mrs Bratbe's August Picnic was published in 1965. It earned plaudits from, among others, Richard Church in Country Life (\\"the most astonishing first novel I have ever read\\") and Anthony Burgess in The Listener, who called Mrs Bratbe \\"as outrageous a prodigy as we have had this side of the war\\". Mrs Bratbe's August Picnic is a retelling of the Oedipus story, with the sexes reversed. Alexandra, daughter of the outrageous media magnate Hytha O. Bratbe, is brought up in France, falls in love (unknowingly) with her father, causes the death of her monstrous mother and blinds herself in remorse. The writing was considered (in The TLS) to owe much to the \\"shadow\\" of Iris Murdoch and the \\"ghosts\\" of Aldous Huxley and Virginia Woolf.*S. Clayton, ‚ÄòNo Picnic‚Äô, Times Literary Supplement (17 February 1966) Wheldon in fact looked more to the 'great tradition' for her masters and in particular to Henry James and D. H. Lawrence. Before Mrs Bratbe's August Picnic had been published Wheldon was at work on a new novel, Daughters of the Flood. It was never published. A conservative estimate of two million words made it quite unpublishable as a single work (for comparison: Marcel Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu ‚Äì a work Wheldon revered ‚Äì is around a million words). Wheldon would never consent to the piecemeal publication that her publishers urged on her, and eventually, as she wrote to Dan Jacobson, the book \\"shattered\\" in her hands. Set nominally in London and Korea in the years of the Korean War, it is, it has been said, \\"about everything\\", though to Norman Podhoretz she said it was \\"about running\\". Wheldon and her mother had been sprinters in their youths. The remark was unhelpful to Podhoretz but her son Wynn has interpreted it as meaning simply \\"about living to your very utmost limit\\". Wheldon ceased writing the book on the death of her mother in 1980, and never went back to it. She wrote that she was never more alive than when she was writing. Wheldon suffered all her life from partial deafness (she was completely deaf in one ear and half deaf in the other, the result of an unsuccessful middle-ear operation in her youth). This made her unhappy in large groups as she could not hear or share in conversation. She also suffered from what is now called bi-polar disorder and was then called manic depression. Later life In 1980 she was asked to become Director of the UK branch of the Committee for the Free World, an organisation of intellectuals unified by a desire to stiffen the sinews of western resistance to communism, to argue against unilateral nuclear disarmament by the West, and to press for the installation of cruise missiles in Western Europe (in response to the communist deployment of SS-20 nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe). Alun Chalfont was the chairman and the committee included intellectuals such as Raymond Aron, Sybille Bedford, Max Beloff, Milovan Djilas, Joachim Fest, and Tom Stoppard. Its activities culminated in the conference 'Beyond 1984', which addressed the continuing threat of communism throughout the world. Her penultimate battle was against the author of her husband's biography. He had discovered, among unsorted papers, letters from Huw Wheldon to his wife of an extremely intimate kind describing sexual fantasies, and had used these, without having informed Wheldon of his discovery, as the foundation of a biography of the broadcaster.Letter from Lady Wheldon to the Sunday Telegraph (22 July 1990) Despite widespread disdain for the book among critics, Wheldon felt that she was at fault, that she had betrayed her husband (\\"inexcusable treachery\\" was her term),Private Papers of Jacqueline Mary Wheldon and by this her morale was destroyed. The book was published in 1990. She struggled with attempts to write her own memoir of her husband, but her desire for omniscience hindered her. After three years battling deteriorating health, Wheldon died of cancer on 21 June 1993 at Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith, not far from her childhood home. Among her final words were: ‚ÄúI shall have such a lot to write about when I get out of here‚Äù.Private Papers of Wynn Pierce Wheldon Her ashes joined those of her husband at the base of an unmarked tree in the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew. Wheldon was short, blonde, blue-eyed, attractive. Her deafness gave her a kind of physical grace, ‚Äúlike patience on a monument‚Äù. She enjoyed the company of intelligent men and women of the world, and they enjoyed hers. She maintained a long correspondence with the art critic John Berger, and with her husband's friend the sculptor and novelist Jonah Jones. After her husband's death the novelist Kingsley Amis made rare trips out of London to take tea at her house in Richmond. The broadcaster Michael Charlton was often in her company. The philosophers Roger Scruton and Kenneth Minogue were regular correspondents, as was the distinguished international lawyer, Robert Glynn. John Mansfield, Emeritus Professor of Jurisprudence at Harvard University, read 1 Corinthians 13 at her funeral. Paul Wright wrote that \\"It was perhaps her constant desire for perfection that was responsible for leaving us so small a literary legacy\\".Daily Telegraph (1 July 1993) Dan Jacobson wrote that Wheldon \\"had a gift for friendship\\";Obituary, Jacqueline Wheldon, The Times (24 June 1993) Melvyn Bragg used precisely the same words, adding that \\"she was one of the very few clever people who was also good\\".Obituary, Independent (28 June 1993) Norman Podhoretz wrote: \\"I have known a few people of genius... but of them all, she was the most luminous.\\" \\"I‚Äôm very interested in what God is,\\" she once said, \\"interested in the idea that God is profound experience\\".M. Pugh, Enter the Girl with a Nose for Disaster, Daily Mail (9 February 1966) By 1976 she had faith enough to write a prayer for her husband during a dire illness. She equated god and love. One of her characters (in the unpublished Daughters of the Flood) writes that \\"love makes the heart yearn for eloquence\\". Sources *L. G. Stroud, Unpublished memoir *P.

G√©lineau was born in Blaye, Gironde, and had a varied life. As a young student at the Rochefort Navy Medical School he took part in the combat against cholera, from which the city of La Rochelle was suffering. In 1849 he became an intern of the Navy Hospital and in the following year a \\"Surgeon of the Third Class\\". As a naval surgeon he visited French colonies in the Indian Ocean: first R√©union island and then Mayotte in the Comoros archipelago. During this period he wrote Voyage a i'lle de la R√©union, a memoir published much later, in 1905, in which he described colonial life and the abolition of slavery. He included the story of Elise, a beautiful Creole woman. She was the concubine of a young naval commander, and had a child who died soon after birth. This indicates the autobiographic character of the work. He defended a doctoral thesis \\"Aper√ßu Medical de I'lle de Mayotte\\" at Montpellier University School of Medicine in 1858, using the data collected during his year-and-a-half stay on Mayotte. At that time he was a \\"Navy Surgeon of the Second Class\\". For his dedication in fighting epidemics that broke out during the Franco-German war in 1870, he was nominated for the Legion of Honor, but received it later on. He also held the Officier d'Academie and Commander of Nichan of the Ottoman Empire.

His speech stated that contemporary bomber aircraft had the performance necessary to conduct a strategic bombing campaign that would destroy a country's cities and there was little that could be done in response. It concluded that the conduct of future wars would require one to \\"kill more women and children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves.\\" At the time of the speech aircraft performance was rapidly improving and new techniques and construction methods were producing ever- larger aircraft. For a time, this resulted in a performance gap where multi- engine aircraft outperformed the single-engine fighter aircraft that would have to intercept them. This gap could be further widened through the use of night bombing, which made interception practically impossible. This state of affairs was relatively short-lived. By the mid-1930s the same techniques were being applied to fighter design, once again handing them a significant performance advantage that allowed them to chase down even the fastest bomber aircraft. During the same period, the introduction of radar created an early warning system that gave interceptors sufficient time to climb to altitude before bombers arrived. The Battle of Britain suggested Baldwin was no longer correct, as RAF Fighter Command's aircraft forced the Germans to give up day bombing, and finally cancel the offensive altogether. Ultimately, even those developments proved too little in the face of a determined attack with large number of aircraft. From 1942, RAF Bomber Command's fleet grew so large that its destructive impact was not seriously affected even by strengthening German defenses. The US Army Air Force's efforts initially fared poorly, but the introduction of escort fighters completely upset the balance in favor of the attacker. By 1944, bombers could fly with impunity over Germany, day or night. Baldwin's argument Baldwin did not advocate total disarmament but believed that \\"great armaments lead inevitably to war\\".. However he came to believe that, as he put it on 9 November 1932, \\"the time has now come to an end when Great Britain can proceed with unilateral disarmament\\".. On 10 November 1932 Baldwin said: This speech was often used against Baldwin as allegedly demonstrating the futility of rearmament or disarmament, depending on the critic. Theoretical basis Many theorists imagined that a future war would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy's military and industrial capability from the air. The Italian general Giulio Douhet, author of The Command of the Air, was a seminal theorist of that school of thought. Before World War I, H. G. Wells's novel The War in the Air concluded that aerial warfare could never be \\"won\\" in such a manner as bombing, but in 1936, he depicted a war starting suddenly with devastating air attacks on \\"Everytown\\" in the film Things to Come. Likewise, Olaf Stapledon, in his 1930 novel Last and First Men, depicts a very brief but devastating war in which fleets of bombers deliver huge payloads of poison gas to the cities of Europe, leaving most of the continent uninhabited. As late as 1939, Nevil Shute portrayed a war opening with a sudden air attack by bombers in his novel What Happened to the Corbetts. At the time, bombers had a slight performance advantage over fighters by having multiple engines and streamlined but heavy cantilever wing designs and so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position in front of the bombers. Before World War II and the invention of radar, detection systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs, those systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. The balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little that could be done about it. For Britain, the answer was to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a deterrent force. Before war began in 1939, such theories resulted in predictions of hundreds of thousands of casualties from bombing. That year, military expert Basil Liddell Hart speculated, for example, 250,000 deaths and injuries could occur across Britain in the first week. Harold Macmillan wrote in 1956 that he and others around him \\"thought of air warfare in 1938 rather as people think of nuclear war today\\". The most influential among the few who disagreed with such views was Hugh Dowding, who led RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain. Others included American Major Claire Chennault, who argued against the so-called \\"Bomber Mafia\\" at the Air Corps Tactical School,Greer, Thomas H. (1985). The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917‚Äì1941 USAF Historical Studies No. 89. Office of Air Force History, p. 63‚Äì65. and Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey, Fighter Projects Officer for the United States Army Air Corps, responsible for specifying American fighters that were capable of downing bombers.  Strategic bombing in combat  Later analysis of the strategic bombing during World War II indicated that Baldwin's statement was essentially correct in that bombers would get through but at a cost in aircrew and aircraft. Using the Dowding system, fighters directed by radar were able to disrupt the German daytime offensive during the Battle of Britain, forcing the Luftwaffe to turn to less accurate night-time bombing in The Blitz. The difficulties for night fighters meant that was relatively unopposed, but the Blitz did not crush British civil morale. On August 17, 1943, US Army Air Forces launched strategic bombing raids on the German cities of Schweinfurt and Regensburg with 376 B-17 bombers without long-range fighter escorts. The mission inflicted heavy damage on the Regensburg target but lost 60 bombers, or 16% of the force, with another 58-95 heavily damaged and a loss of 564 airmen killed, missing or captured. A second raid on October 14 with 291 bombers damaged ball bearing factories, halting production for six weeks, but resulted in the loss of 77 bombers, or approximately 26%, with damage to 121 more and 655 airmen killed or captured. Unescorted daylight bomber raids deep into Germany were suspended until February 1944. The Royal Air Force's Bomber Command lost a total of 8,325 aircraft on bombing missions during the war, during a total of 364,514 sorties.Richard Humble, \\"War in the Air 1939‚Äì1945\\", Salamander 1975 That represents 2.3% losses per mission on average. However, loss rates over Germany were significantly higher: between November 1943 and March 1944, operations over that country resulted in an average 5.1% loss rate. The disparity in loss rates was reflected in the fact that at one point in the war, Bomber Command considered making sorties over France were only a third of an op towards the \\"tour\\" total.Yorkshire Airfields - P Otter p. 262 Furthermore, the official loss rate figures never included aircraft crashing in the UK on their return (usually by damage picked up on the operation) even if the machine was a write off and/or some or all of the crew were killed, which added at least 15% to the official loss figures. Losses on that scale could be made good through increased production and training efforts but at a great cost. Indeed, the size of Bomber Command's offensive grew throughout the war. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey came to the same conclusion. However, Douhet's belief that a small number of bombs would be successful in forcing a country to surrender proved to be incorrect, and bombing alone did not cause the collapse he had expected in either Britain or Germany. In the Pacific War, bombing missions were effectively conducted by both Japan and the Western Allies. Early in the war, Japanese carrier aircraft successfully destroyed or disabled the battleships of the US Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawaii and destroyed the great majority of bombers and defensive aircraft there and in the Philippine Islands. The US military could not make effective use of the single radar installation based in Hawaii (it was used part-time as a training device) and visual spotters in the Philippines that should have provided an early warning to their fighter squadrons. In later stages, US bombers effectively destroyed many Japanese cities with conventional or incendiary bombs before the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \\"The bomber will not always get through\\" After World War II, the major powers built heavy strategic bombers to carry nuclear weapons. By the 1960s, however, advances in ground-based radar, guided missiles, radar-guided anti- aircraft guns, and fighter planes greatly decreased the odds that bombers could reach their targets, whether they used the traditional high-altitude or newer low-altitude approach. One 1964 study of British V bombers estimated that a bomber that did not use chaff or other countermeasures would encounter an average of six missiles, each with a 75 percent chance of destroying its target. The study thus stated that \\"the bomber will not always get through\\", and advocated Britain emphasize the Polaris submarine missile instead. For similar reasons, the United States Navy deployed Polaris submarines during that decade. At that time, it shifted aircraft carriers away from delivering strategic nuclear weapons to a role suited for both general nuclear and limited non-nuclear wars. The United States Air Force found converting its large fleet of manned bombers to non-nuclear roles more difficult. It attempted to redesign the B-70 Valkyrie high-altitude supersonic bomber project as a platform for reconnaissance and launch of standoff missiles such as the Skybolt; however, Skybolt was cancelled in 1962 after testing failures. A 1963 study stated \\"Long-range technical considerations, of course, militate against the perpetuation of the manned bomber\\". Recent reuse of phrase In the 21st century, the phrase was reused to refer to suicide bombers and the inability of legislation or security to stop someone intent on blowing something up..

Some variants have multiple layers of different materials. Tygon is a registered trademark of Saint-Gobain Corporation. It is an invented word, owned and used by Saint-Gobain and originated in the late 1930s. Tygon products are produced in three countries, but sold throughout the world. Tygon tubing is used in many markets, including food and beverage, chemical processing, industrial, laboratory, medical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor processing. There are many formulations of clear, flexible, Tygon tubing. The chemical resistance and physical properties vary among the different formulations, but the tubing generally is intended to be \\"so resistant to chemical attack that it will handle practically any chemical\\", whether liquid, gas, or slurry.Shugar, Gershon J. and Jack T. Ballinger, Chemical technicians' ready reference handbook, fourth edition, page 378, McGraw-Hill 1996 While largely non- reactive, Tygon has been reported to liberate carbon monoxide and is listed among carbon monoxide-releasing molecules. Formulations and applications=Food and beverage applications Tygon B-44-3, Tygon B-44-4X, Tygon B-44-4X I.B., and Tygon Silver (antimicrobial) were widely used in the food and beverage industry, in particular in: beverage dispensing, dairy processing, soft-serve dispensing, vitamin and flavor concentrate systems, cosmetic production, and water purification systems. These formulations each meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration 3-A and NSF International 51 criteria but they do not comply with European Directives (European Directive 2002/72/EC of 6 August 2002 relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs as modified in particular by Directive 2007/19/EC of 2 April 2007).  Class VI approved  Several formulations of Tygon are USP class VI approved and can be used in either surgical procedures or pharmaceutical processing. =Medical= Tygon Medical/Surgical Tubing S-50-HL ‚Äî Characterized to the latest ISO 10993 standards and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for biocompatibility. This material is non-toxic, non-hemolytic, and non-pyrogenic. This formulation is used in minimally invasive devices, dialysis equipment, for bypass procedures, and chemotherapy drug delivery. Tygon Medical Tubing S-54-HL was introduced in 1964 for use in medical applications. This material can be used in catheters, for intravenous or intra-arterial infusion and other surgical uses. Tygon S-54-HL can also be fabricated into cannulae or protective sheath products using thermoforming and flaring techniques. =Pharmaceutical= Tygon LFL (Long Flex Life) pump tubing is non-toxic clear tubing with broad chemical resistance. It is often used in product filtration and fermentation and surfactant delivery. Tygon 2275 High Purity Tubing is a plasticizer-free material that is often used in sterile filling and dispensing systems and diagnostic equipment. This formulation is also considered to have low absorption/adsorption properties, which minimizes the risk of fluid alteration. Tygon 2275 I.B. High-Purity Pressure Tubing is plasticizer-free and is reinforced with a braid for use with elevated working pressures. Peristaltic pumps Many formulations of Tygon can be used in peristaltic pumps, including the following: Tygon R-3603 Laboratory Tubing is commonly used in chemical laboratories. It is often used in incubators and as a replacement for rubber tubing for Bunsen burners. This material is produced in vacuum sizes and can withstand a full vacuum at room temperature. It is a thermoplastic PVC-based material with plasticizer. Tygon R-1000 Ultra-Soft Tubing is used in general laboratory applications. It is the softest of the Tygon formulations with a durometer hardness of Shore A 40 (ASTM Method D2240-02). Because of the low durometer of this material it is often used in low-torque peristaltic pumps. Tygon LFL (Long Flex Life) Pump Tubing, Tygon 3350, Tygon S-50-HL Medical/Surgical Tubing, Tygon 2275 High Purity Tubing, and Tygon 2001 Tubing are also used in peristaltic pump applications.  Plasticizer-free/non-DEHP  Tygon tubing is available in Plasticizer- free/non-DEHP (non-Phthalate)-formulations. These formulations have a high degree of chemical resistance and do not release any hazardous material when properly incinerated. Tygon 2275 High Purity tubing, Tygon Ultra Chemical Resistant Tubing 2075, and Tygon Plasticizer Free Tubing 2001 are all plasticizer-free. \\"ND-100 series\\" products are non-DEHP and use a non- Phthalate plasticizer. Tygon Silver Tubing has a plasticizer-free inner bore and a silver-based compound on the inner surface to decrease bacterial growth and protect against microbes. Industrial use There are several formulations of Tygon that are used in industrial applications. * Tygon Fuel and Lubricant Tubing F-4040-A is translucent yellow for positive identification and flow monitoring. It is used in small engine fuel lines, recreational vehicles, and lubrication lines. * Tygon LP1100 is a low permeation EPA and CARB certified fuel linehttp://www.processsystems.saint- gobain.com/tygon-lp1100-tubing.aspx also used in small engines. * Tygon R-3400 UV Resistant Tubing is black in color and opaque. It remains flexible in ultraviolet (UV) environments and is often used for electrical insulation, ink, and adhesive dispensing, and fertilizer and pesticide dispensing. Because it is resistant to UV light, ozone, and weathering, it is commonly used in outdoor applications. * Tygon 2075 Ultra Chemical Resistant Tubing is a plasticizer-free material that is known for its high degree of chemical resistance. It can be used in ink and printing fluid dispensing, paint and solvent production, and is resistant to MEK and other chemicals. When properly incinerated it releases only carbon dioxide and water. * Tygon 2375 Ultra Chemical Resistant Tubing is now replacing Tygon 2075.

Schelhaas was born in Liverpool, where he started his career playing bass for several bands and releasing a single on Decca's Deram label as the soul band Bernie & the Buzz Band in 1968 before finally turning to keyboards and starting the softrock band 'National Head Band' in 1970 with Neil Ford on guitar & future- Uriah Heep's Lee Kerslake on drums. They released the album Albert One in 1971 produced by Yes producer Eddie Offord, but without any success. Next stop for Schelhaas was the Gary Moore band and the recording of the album Grinding Stone from 1973. After the recording, he left Moore to do solo projects including an organ session on Thin Lizzy's 1973 Vagabonds of the Western World album. In July 1975, Schelhaas was asked to play keyboard in the band Caravan after Dave Sinclair left them. Jan Schelhaas toured the world around with the band and recorded three albums: Blind Dog at St. Dunstans (1976), Better by Far (1977) and Cool Water, which wasn't released until 1994. The summer of 1978, Caravan had a break and Schelhaas accepted an offer to join Camel on their world tour for their album Breathless (1978). At that time, the band also included cousins Richard Sinclair (bass & vocals) and Dave Sinclair (keyboards) with whom he'd already played in Caravan. Schelhaas worked with Camel until 1981, when he contributed to I Can See Your House from Here from 1979 and the album Nude from 1981. [Dead Link] From 1982 to 1989, he played on two of Lee Fardon's albums: The God Given Right and The Savage Art of Love and the EP Palestine. Schelhaas had met Fardon when they both played with Ross Stagg in the early 70's. In 2002, Schelhaas was once again asked to join Caravan due to Dave Sinclair having left because of musical differences. He recorded The Unauthorized Breakfast Item with them in the same year plus a tour. Although there was a hiatus in the band's activities from 2005-10 (during which he released his first solo album, Dark Ships, in 2008), Jan remains a member of Caravan and appears on their latest album, 2013's Paradise Filter.

Biography Born in Dharmaj, Gujarat, India, Desai moved to Tanzania, East Africa, in 1956. At the age of twenty two, she married Suryakant, a factory owner. The couple were from middle class mercantile backgrounds. They later moved to Britain before the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 made it harder for British passport holders from former British colonies to enter the country.  Grunwick Dispute  In Britain, she had to take up low-paid work, first as a sewing machinist, then processing film in the Grunwick factory. She resigned after being ordered to work overtime, and instigated a strike among the mainly Asian and female workforce. The strikers protested about working conditions, pay inequality and institutionalised racism within the company.http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/histories/asian/politics/grunwick.htm Jeyaben Desai part in the Grunwick Dispute Women were made to asked why they needed to go to the toilet, and Desai counselled her colleagues not to be intimidated by this, saying \\"Why should you feel ashamed, when he has no shame is asking you loudly. Learn how to say it in English \\"I want to go to the ladies\\" and then just say it without any hesitation\\". Desai led the strikers in their epic two-year picket from 1976 to 1978. The strike was backed by the Apex union and the local postal union initially refused to deliver the Grunwick photography laboratory post, until challenged with the support of the Tory party, at that time the government Opposition. Desai was an inspiring speaker, often forming memorable phrases, for example her parting shot to the boss when she led the walkout: \\"What you are running here is not a factory, it is a zoo. But in a zoo there are many types of animals. Some are monkeys who dance on your fingertips, others are lions who can bite your head off. We are the lions, Mr Manager.\\" Whilst on one of the thousand delegations the Grunwick strikers sent to factories across the country to raise supoort for the strike, Mrs Desai was challenged by a manager who said \\"You can't win with that sari on, why don't you change into a miniskirt?\\" Desai replied \\"I'll tell you something, manager. Mrs Gandhi wears a sari and she runs a country of 600 million people. You can't even run a little factory\\". After the abortive hunger strike outside the Trades Union Congress headquarters in November 1977 she remarked: \\"Trade Union support is like honey on the elbow - you can smell it, you can feel it, but you cannot taste it.\\" The prime minister Jim Callaghan appointed a judge, Lord Justice Scarman to settle the dispute. Mrs Desai testified at length. Judge Scarman recommeded that the union should be recognised and the sacked workers reinstated. The factory owner ignored the report and the unions backed off, leaving the Grunwick strike committee to announce the strike was over on 14 July 1978.  After the strike  Desai returned to the sewing industry and later became a teacher at Harrow College. She passed her driving test at the age of 60 and encouraged other women to do so to increase their freedom. Mrs Desai (as she was always referred to) recorded her thoughts for the Brent Museum and archives. In an interview by Hannah Phung of Brent Museum she said: \\"It was amazing, let me tell you, it was amazing.[‚Ä¶] tears were in my eyes to see these people [‚Ä¶] they were hurting themselves and the police were charging them with horses and everything and still they were standing strong.\\" Jayaben Desai died on 23 December 2010. Her family scattered her ashes near the sources of the Indus and Ganges rivers and in Rotherhithe on the Thames.  Commemoration  On 14 December 2016 she was named as one of seven women chosen by BBC Radio Four's Woman's Hour for their 2016 Power List, which was topped by Margaret Thatcher and also included Helen Brook, Barbara Castle, Germaine Greer, Bridget Jones and Beyonc√©.\\"Margaret Thatcher tops Woman's Hour Power List\\", BBC News, 14 December 2016.

Presently, he serves as a Research Professor of Law, Distinguished Scholar in Public Law & Comparative Law, Director ‚Äì Centre for Comparative Law and Chairman of the Law School Doctoral Committee at Jindal Global Law School. He is best known amongst students of Constitution of India as the author of V.N. Shukla's Constitution of India a standard textbook for lawyers on Constitution of India. Internationally however, he is more famous amongst scholars of comparative law for his work, German Administrative Law in Common Law Perspective. Early life and influences Singh was born in a village called Jitholi in the district of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Having lost his parents at a very young age, he was brought up by his grandparents. Most of his childhood and adulthood were spent in this rural environment, an element which according to him left a lasting impression on his understanding of the nature of Indian legal systems. He received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Agra, followed by an LL.B from the same institution. He has said that he was motivated to study the Constitution after having read Corwin's \\"The Higher Law\\" Background of American Constitutional Law. He read for his LL.M at University of Lucknow under the leading constitutional law expert, Professor V. N. Shukla. He followed it up with another LL.M at the Columbia Law School, where he had the opportunity to study under the leading authority on American administrative law and civil liberties, Walter Gellhorn. He came back to India to read for his LL.D from the University of Lucknow. In 1970, Professor Singh joined the Faculty of Law, University of Delhi, where he was to remain as a Professor of Law until 2005. At the University of Delhi, Professor P. K. Tripathi had an important influence on his work. From 1980 until 1982 and then again in 1985, he studied and researched in Germany at the South Asia Institute of the University of Heidelberg, and at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law. The result was not only a fruition of learned academics, but also lifelong association with leading German scholars. Most important of these was Professor Dietrich Conrad, one of the leading scholars of constitutional law from post-World War II Germany. Career He started his career in 1964 as a lecturer of law at the University of Meerut, and later in 1970 moved to the Faculty of Law, University of Delhi. He also served as the Director of the Indian Law Institute. From December 2006 to December 2011, he was the Vice-Chancellor of The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata. NUJS Law Review, which is a quarterly publication of that university, was conceptualised by him and has undertaken the responsibility of conducting and publishing its own research. He was also its founding Editor- in-Chief. He had also been the Chairperson of the Delhi Judicial Academy. Professor Singh is current Chancellor of the Central University of Haryana.http://www.cuh.ac.in He is also the Visiting Professor at the National Law University Delhi where he holds the Chair of Comparative Law.http://www.nludelhi.ac.in/pep-fac-new-pro.aspx?Id=19 On his 70th birthday on 15 July 2010, a festschrift titled \\"Law and (In) Equalities\\" was released in his honour. The book dwells on the aspects of societal inequality in India, a theme which has remained central to Professor Singh's study of Indian Constitution and law. In another gesture, on 12 December 2009, the All India Law Teacher's Congress presented Professor Singh the 'Life Time Best Teacher Award'. On 28 September 2017, University of Delhi conferred upon him the title of Professor Emeritus in recognition of his achievements as Professor of Law.  Central themes in work  Unarguably, Professor Singh's most important contribution has been by way of analysing and understanding persistent inequalities in Indian society. Within the framework of Indian Constitution, he has argued for a distinction between distributive justice and compensatory justice, emphasising upon the importance of the latter in battling the age old hierarchies within Indian society. His work on reservation for backward classes and minorities has led to him to conclude that the fundamental rights mentioned in the Constitution should be interpreted in an Indian context, which means that a betterment of the society has to be brought about in terms of understanding and improving the Indian ways of life, rather than attempting their surgical replacement.  Positions held  Professor Singh has been a fellow and visiting professor at several institutions and universities of international repute. In 1985 he was designated as the Professor of Law at Faculty of Law, University of Delhi. in 1994, he was appointed as the Dean of the Faculty of Law, and Head of the Department of Law, University of Delhi, positions that he retained till 1997. In 1980‚Äì1982 and again in 1985 he was Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the University of Heidelberg. The result of this stay was not only his works on German administrative law, and on minorities, but also a long and fruitful association between Indian and German legal academia. He briefly served as the Director of the Indian Law Institute in 1997. He joined the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences as its Vice-Chancellor in December 2006 till 2011. Between 2007 and 2010 he co-chaired Task Force - 1, Commission on Centre-State Relationship, Government of India. He then served as Chairperson of Delhi Judicial Academy from 2011 till 2013. He has also served as External Advisor, Centre for Minority Studies, Kansai University, Japan. Professor Singh was also a visiting professor and Head of Law Division at the South Asia Institute, University of Heidelberg in 1987‚Äì88 and visiting professor at the Faculty of Law, University of Heidelberg in 1991‚Äì92. In 1999‚Äì2000 and 2001 he was fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, Heidelberg. He was a visiting professor at the University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000 and 2005, Kansai University, Osaka in 2002, National University of Singapore in 2005 and Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi in 2006. In 2002‚Äì03 he was fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin[action]=details&tx;_wikofellows_pi1[uid]=338&tx;_wikofellows_pi1[backpid]=155 and in 2004, at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. In 2008 Renmin University of China, Beijing honoured him as visiting professor for three years. His publications include over one hundred papers in different legal journals and edited works and ten books including German Administrative Law in Common Law Perspective, Freedom of Trade and Commerce in India, Comparative Constitutional Law, Legal Dimensions of Market Economy and Human Rights and Basic Needs.  Work on legal education in India  Professor Singh has laid especial emphasis in making legal education more meaningful to Indian society by making the top law schools more accessible to the students from less privileged background. At NUJS, and since, he has been leading an effort called IDIA, or 'Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access', which involves an engagement with school going children from different parts of semi-urban and rural India and to encourage and help them enter the top law schools of the country. Towards the same end, he has also been heading a group of academicians, called the Legal Education and Research Society or 'LEARS' as it is popularly referred to. He has also been running a school in his village Jitholi for the children of the nearby places.

Alwall pioneered the technique of ultrafiltration and introduced the principle of hemofiltration. Alwall is referred to as the \\"father of extracorporeal blood treatment.\\"  Artificial kidney  Dialysis machine for rabbits, Nils Alwall, 1944 Willem Johan Kolff constructed the first artificial kidney, however it was not very useful clinically, because it did not allow for removal of excess fluid. Alwall modified a similar construction to the Kolff kidney by enclosing it inside a stainless steel canister. This allowed the removal of fluids, by applying a negative pressure to the outside canister. Thus making it the first truly practical device for hemodialysis. Alwall treated his first patient in acute kidney injury on the September 3, 1946, who responded well to the treatment but died of pneumonia a short while after. Alwall also was arguably the inventor of the arteriovenous shunt for dialysis. He reported this first in 1948, where he used such an arteriovenous shunt in rabbits. Subsequently, he used such shunts, made of glass, as well as his canister-enclosed dialyzer, to treat 1,500 people in kidney failure between 1946 and 1960, as reported to the First International Congress of Nephrology held in Evian in September 1960. As of 2007, two patients for which kidney replacement therapy was initiated by Alwall in 1968 and 1971 respectively have survived for over 35 years on hemodialysis. These patients represent two of the longest known survivors on hemodialysis worldwide.  Later life  Alwall was appointed to a newly created Chair of Nephrology at Lund University in 1957. Subsequently, he collaborated with Swedish businessman Holger Crafoord to found one of the key companies that would manufacture dialysis equipment in the past 40 years, Gambro, Inc.

Heppenstall (8 May 1901 in England - 1994) was a leading Bible scholar and theologian of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. A 1985 questionnaire of North American Adventist lecturers revealed Heppenstall was the Adventist writer who had most influenced them.  Biography  Heppenstall was born in 1901 at Rotherham, Yorkshire, England to Arthur and Georgina Heppenstall. He had one sister, Margaret. Early in their lives, about 1915, their father died. Arthur and Georgina had been married only ten years.Emmerson, W. L. Obituary for Cooke. British Advent Messenger, December 9, 1966, pp. 7,8 In 1915, Georgina and her two children joined the Adventist church. The Rotherham Adventist church met at the Heppenstall home. During middle to late 1920s, Ted Heppenstall worked as a student colporteur in various locations in the British Isles. In 1929, he served on the staff of Stanborough College as Preceptor (Men's Dean) and English teacher. The British Adventist media referred to him as E. A. Heppenstall. He moved to the United States in 1931. He earned a BA degree at Emmanuel Missionary College, majoring in English literature and also doing work in science and theology. Then he got a master's degree from the University of Michigan in History and Semitics. While teaching at La Sierra College he earned a PhD degree in the field of Religious Education from the University of Southern California in 1951. He pastored several churches, and also served as youth director for the Michigan Conference. He served as a professor of theology at La Sierra College, now La Sierra University, from 1940 to 1955. He taught and was also the chairman of the systematic theology department at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews University (1955‚Äì1966). He was also professor of theology at Loma Linda University (1966‚Äì1970). The commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians for the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary was written by him. He had two children, both doctors ‚Äì Malcolm Heppenstall, MD; and Astrid Heppenstall Heger, MD. Theology His presentations on the law and covenants at the 1952 Bible Conference were highly influential upon the theology of the church. Heppenstall was responsible for a fuller understanding of the church's \\"investigative judgment\\" teaching. Heppenstall was one of the most influential scholars to come out against M. L. Andreasen's final generation theology. While upholding the \\"pillar\\" doctrines of the Adventist pioneers, he moved forward on the understanding on such issues as the human nature of Christ and the atonement. He emphasized, as did Questions on Doctrine, the atonement on the cross with a continuing ministry in heaven in the antitypical Day of Atonement. Beyond these issues, he stressed such teachings as the helplessness of human beings to do good of their own selves, justification by faith in relation to the entire plan of salvation, the impossibility of humanly achieving what some people think of as sinless perfection, the fact that Jesus was not just like other children of fallen Adam and the new covenant experience. Heppenstall's theology was seen by some as more cross-centered, Christ-centered, evangelical form of theology which in some ways differed from the then popular SDA understanding of salvation. This plainly shows up in Heppenstall's ideas on character perfection, the teaching that through the efforts of Christ people must overcome sin, he argued that nowhere does the Bible equate perfection with sinlessness when speaking of the child of God. He also said that salvation by grace means being shaken loose from what he considered to be the folly of implanting our ego at the center of the plan of salvation with the belief that we must arrive at sinless perfection to be sure of salvation. Focusing on the fact that sin is deeper than actions, that it is a part of human nature, Heppenstall said that sin does not reign in the true Christian's life, but it does remain in the sense that human nature, with its inherent limitations, cannot even faultlessly discern the complete will of God. He argued from the Bible that it is essentially spiritual maturity and walking with God in love. \\"Thus perfection, he pointed out while citing Ellen White's thoughts on the topic, is relative.\\" SDA Historian George Knight argues that Ellen's view was not the same one held by Andreasen. He notes how White describes that Jesus, as a child, unlike other children, had an inclination to right rather than having sinful tendencies. Andreasen ideas this issue, agreed with that of with Jones, Waggoner, and Prescott, but not with Ellen White's understanding of the exact content and disposition of the \\"sinful\\" nature of Christ. White, Ellen, 1898, Youth Instructor, Sept. 8. quote: \\"It is not correct to say, as many writers have said, that Christ was like all children. He was not like all children. Many children are misguided and mismanaged. But Joseph, and especially Mary, kept before them the remembrance of their child's divine Fatherhood. Jesus was instructed in accordance with the sacred character of His mission. His inclination to right was a constant gratification to His parents.\\" White's understanding on the subject however is still very much under dispute. With his conclusions, Heppenstall returned to a basic Wesleyan concept of perfection as love in dynamic growth. While Heppenstall's writings were influential, his teaching career was much more so. He influenced a generation of preachers and religion teachers through his college and seminary lectures. Themes highlighted by Heppenstall would echo in other classrooms through such teachers as Hans LaRondelle and Raoul Dederen, and in the pulpit through Morris Venden, throughout the 1970s and 1980s. One Heppenstall prot√©g√© would eventually attain special visibility in the church. Heppenstall recognized the talents of Desmond Ford in the mid-1950s. In the early 1960s they both fought against what they believed to be the excesses and distortions of the Andreasen/Robert Brinsmead (in his early stage) perfectionist theology. But Ford would eventually move beyond Heppenstall in some theological areas that his mentor could not agree with. Heppenstall was disappointed when he failed to dissuade Ford from his position at Glacier View, subsequently writing to him that he \\"was shocked at how far\\" he \\"had swung to the left Biblically and doctrinally\\". Desmond Ford apostatized and left the Adventist church. Influenced by Ford, Robert Brinsmead followed suit. Earlier Adventism tended to view the judgment in stern tones, with God keeping out those who hadn't been faithful. More recent times have witnessed an emphasis on the belief that God is for people, that He is on their side and wants them to be in the kingdom. Heppenstall said God's judgment will be in favor of believers. God's people have nothing to fear from the judgment with Christ as their advocate. The saint of the last days can also find confidence and security in facing the judgment when their names are confessed before the Father and the angelic host.

Description It is a semi-evergreen shrub growing to 3.5 m tall with a low spreading crown that reproduces by seed. It can grow from 2 - 12 metres tall and it branches from near the base. The leaves are 2.5‚Äì9 cm long, pinnate, with six to eight leaflets; the leaflets are 1.6‚Äì4.5 cm long and 1.1‚Äì2.3 cm broad. The yellow flowers are produced in masses with a few together on short racemes and 12‚Äì16 mm long. The plant flowers from mid autumn to winter, attracting bees and butterflies.Christmas Senna (Senna bicapsularis) by The National Gardening Association. Uses The Nahuas of San Luis Potosi resort to this plant for the healing of the enchantment. For this reason, the patient is cleaned with seven leaves of its leaves, passing them throughout the body. Likewise, as part of this treatment, while the healer prays, he perfumes the patient's body with a charcoal, rosemary and copal incense and then cleanses it with an egg to remove the \\"bad air\\" that has taken possession of his body. The leaves are edible and are used to cure erysipelas in Morelos, and as an antiseptic in Oaxaca. The sap from emaciated leaves can be used externally, with salt, to heal rashes, sores, bites, stings, eczema, scabies, ringworm and thrush. In the 20th century, Maximino Mart√≠nez points out the following uses: cathartic and to counteract the effects of arthropod stings. The seedpod flavour resembles tamarind. The leaves can be cooked as a vegetable, which can be mixed with other leaves, beans or peas. Invasive species It is naturalised and invasive in several coastal areas in the tropics, including Tanzania, Kenya, the Gal√°pagos Islands and New Caledonia, where it is found in roadsides and disturbed areas, wooded grasslands, fallow land and riparian zones.

Psalm 119:126 states: \\"It is time for the Lord to act, for your law has been broken\\" (New Oxford Annotated Bible ad loc.; Eth la'asot Yahweh he-feru Toratekha) This verse would seem to suggest that, when the wicked are breaking the commandments, God will deliver the steadfast. However, in the readings of rabbinic midrash, an alternate meaning of the verse is given, due to an ambiguity in the Biblical Hebrew: instead of God acting in response to sin, humans should act on behalf of God. Thus, the verse may be understood as: \\"It is time to work for the Lord...\\" History In the tannaitic period, the sage Hillel the Elder cited the verse to call fellow Jews to intensively study the Torah when it is neglected. (Ephraim Urbach interprets Hillel as calling for fuller observance of the Torah commandments in general, The Sages pp. 341f.) Rabbi Nathan makes a related gesture, for Jewish efforts against heresy, at the end of Mishnah Berakhot. Nathan transposes the two halves of the verse thus: \\"They have made void your law, it is time to work for the Lord.\\" (See Urbach, 836n.93) In the Talmudic period, the verse is thus called upon to justify the radical shift in rabbinic belief after the destruction of the Temple. Due to the conditions of exilic Jewry, the rabbinic leadership decided to permit the Oral Torah to be transcribed in writing and disseminated. The verse is interpreted to mean that \\"It is better that one letter of the Torah [the verse forbidding the writing down of the Oral Torah] should be uprooted than that the whole of the Torah be forgotten.\\" (Gittin 60a-b, Elon Jewish Law 5:1, Louis Jacobs, p. 133 trans.) In the modern period, the dramatic character of the verse again enters the stage. The verse is among those utilized to justify rabbinic innovations in halakhah (Elon Jewish Law 14:3, 14:5). In Enlightenment period Germany, both the Reform rabbis and their Orthodox opponents cite the verse to justify the urgent nature of their actions (\\"It is time to act for the Lord\\"). The two conflicting positions see quite different referents for the verse's \\"they have voided the law\\"‚Äîthe Reformers felt the need to accommodate the growing disinterest in Jewish law, whereas the Orthodox felt that the Reformers themselves were voiding the law.

Location The nearest city to Chamalapura is Mysore. It is situated at an aerial distance of 15 km from Mysore. The distance through road would be around 30 km from the Mysore city. The place can be reached by going towards SJCE college or All India Institute of Speech and Hearing or Bogadi. We have to then proceed on the Gaddige road. At about 25 km, we get a village called Halanahalli. We have to move forward by a kilometre or two and take a left turn. On travelling 5 km more, we reach Chamalapura. Thermal power station Government of Karnataka is trying to build a thermal power station in this rich soil area. This area is very near to Nagarahole National Park and Kabini river. Environmentalists are arguing that this project will surely pollute the surrounding flora and fauna. The people of Chamalapura are not ready to give up their lands. Citizens of mysore are also against this project. But the Government of Karnataka is backing this project by stating that it will generate electricity and make up for the shortage faced by Karnataka state. But the people against this project argue that Transmission Loss and robbery of electricity amounts to 40%. If this loss is controlled effectively, then there is no need for thermal power station. The Government has argued that the land is barren and not fit for cultivation. Hence a project in this place is favourable. But going by the photos published in the newspapers,The Hindu : Front Page : Government to go ahead with Chamalapura power project it can be well concluded that the land is very much fertile.

A \\"project\\" consists of a coordinated series of activities or tasks performed by engineers, designers, drafters and others from one or more engineering disciplines or departments. Project tasks consist of such things as performing calculations, writing specifications, preparing bids, reviewing equipment proposals and evaluating or selecting equipment and preparing various lists, such as equipment and materials lists, and creating drawings such as electrical, piping and instrumentation diagrams, physical layouts and other drawings used in design and construction. A small project may be under the direction of a project engineer. Large projects are typically under the direction of a project manager or management team. Some facilities have in house staff to handle small projects, while some major companies have a department that does internal project engineering. Large projects are typically contracted out to engineering companies. Staffing at engineering companies varies according to the work load and duration of employment may only last until an individual's tasks are completed. Overview=Responsibilities The role of the project engineer can often be described as that of a liaison between the project manager and the technical disciplines involved in a project. The distribution of \\"liaising\\" and performing tasks within the technical disciplines can vary wildly from project to project; this often depends on the type of product, its maturity, and the size of the company, to name a few. It is important for a project engineer to understand that balance. The project engineer should be knowledgeable enough to be able to speak intelligently within the various disciplines, and not purely be a liaison. The project engineer is also often the primary technical point of contact for the consumer. A project engineer's responsibilities include schedule preparation, pre-planning and resource forecasting for engineering and other technical activities relating to the project. They may also be in charge of performance management of vendors. They assure the accuracy of financial forecasts, which tie-in to project schedules. They ensure projects are completed according to project plans. Project engineers manage project team resources and training and develop extensive project management experience and expertise. Engineering companies When use, an engineering company is generally contracted to conduct a study (capital cost estimate or technical assessment) or to design a project. Projects are designed to achieve some specific objective, ranging in scope from simple modifications to new factories or expansions costing hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. The client usually provides the engineering company with a scoping document listing the details of the objective in terms of such things as production rate and product specifications and general to specific information about processes and equipment to be used and the expected deliverables, such as calculations, drawings, lists, specifications, schedules, etc. The client is typically involved in the entire design process and makes decisions throughout, including the technology, type of equipment to use, bid evaluation and supplier selection, the layout of equipment and operational considerations. Depending on the project the engineering company may perform material and energy balances to size equipment and to quantify inputs of materials and energy (steam, electric power, fuel). This information is used to write specifications for the equipment. The equipment specifications are sent out for bids. The client, the engineering company or both select the equipment. The equipment suppliers provide drawings of the equipment, which are used by the engineering company's mechanical engineers, and drafters to make general arrangement drawings, which show how the pieces of equipment are located in relation to other equipment. Layout drawings show specific information about the equipment, electric motors powering the equipment and such things as auxiliary equipment (pumps, fans, air compressors), piping and buildings. The engineering company maintains an equipment list with major equipment, auxiliary equipment, motors, etc. Electrical engineers are involved with power supply to motors and equipment. Process engineers perform material and energy balances and design the piping and instrumentation diagrams to show how equipment is supplied with process fluids, water, air, gases, etc. and the type of control loops used. The instrumentation and controls engineers specify the instrumentation and controls and handle any computer controls and control rooms. Civil and structural engineers deal with site layout and engineering, building design and structural concerns like foundations, pads, structures, supports and bracing for equipment. Environmental engineers deal with any air emissions and treatment of liquid effluent. Fields and topics The various fields and topics that projects engineers are involved with include: *Work breakdown structure: a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components *Gantt chart: type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule *Critical Path Analysis: an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities *Program evaluation and review technique: a statistical tool which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project *Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique: network analysis technique that allows probabilistic treatment both network logic and estimation of activity duration *Petri Nets: one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems Construction industry Project engineers are often project managers with qualifications in engineering or construction management. Other titles include field engineer, construction engineer, or construction project engineer. In smaller projects, this person may also be responsible for contracts and will be called an assistant project manager. A similar role is undertaken by a client's engineer or owner's engineer, but by inference, these often act more in the interests of the commissioning company. Project engineers do not necessarily do design work, but instead represent the contractor or client out in the field, help tradespeople interpret the job's designs, ensure the job is constructed according to the project plans, and assist project controls, including budgeting, scheduling, and planning. In some cases a project engineer is responsible for assisting the assigned project manager with regard to design and a project and with the execution of one or more simultaneous projects in accordance with a valid, executed contract, per company policies and procedures and work instructions for customized and standardized plants. Typical responsibilities may include: daily operations of field work activities and organization of subcontractors; coordination of the implementation of a project, ensuring it is being built correctly; project schedules and forecasts; interpretation of drawings for tradesmen; review of engineering deliverables; redlining drawings; regular project status reports; budget monitoring and trend tracking; bill of materials creation and maintenance; effective communications between engineering, technical, construction, and project controls groups; and assistance to the project manager.

History  Between the 12th and the 9th century BC the mainstream of the Po followed this channel; its course followed more or less today's system of the Fissero- Tartaro-Canalbianco canals and flowed into the Adriatic Sea by the site of Adria town. At that time the coastline was far more upriver than nowadays. The first hamlets of Adria were settled by the Veneti; also the settlement of Frattesina, near modern Fratta Polesine, was active by this river during these centuries. During the 9th or 8th century BC the main stream of the Po river changed, due to the so-called \\"breach at Sermide\\", and followed a channel more to the south, the Spina river. The Etruscans dug canals in order to drain the \\"Adrian swamps\\" (i.e. the swamps that surrounded Adria); the Tartaro river was diverted north-east into the Philistina canalGallicciolli and other canals (the fossiones) were dug parallel to the coastline in order to allow inland navigation.Braccesi, pp.52-53 The town of Adria and its port on the Adria river flourished in the 6th century BC; new settlements were founded on dry land, inland from the sea, up the Adria and lesser streams. The Adria river was still active while the Greeks settled the area in the 4th century BC, ruled by Dionysius I of Syracuse and his son Dionysius II; the Greeks also maintained the drainage canals, though imposing on them Greek river names: for instance Philistina is from Philistus. The Adria channel survived the Gauls period and was still there when the Romans arrived. In the first century AD, Pliny the Elder however does not write of this Adria river; the Adige overflowed into the Tartaro-Philistina and caused a flood in the area that returned to wetlands. The port of Adria was still working thanks to the fossiones and the other canals, still maintained by the Romans. The sources of Pliny most probably referred to a previous state of the territory, so it is almost certain that the Adria channel ceased to exist before or about the 1st century BC.Uggeri, p.45-46.

The Gibson Guarantee. Imago Publishing, 1994. Early life George Butterworth was born on 5 January 1905 in Brinscall, near Chorley Lancashire. His mother was Edith Harris and his father Frederick W. Butterworth - a British parallel bars champion. George was their third son. George showed promise as an artist and gained admission to the Stockport School of Art at age sixteen. He was accomplished enough there to receive a scholarship to the Manchester School of Art. According to his biography, his anatomical studies even impressed local doctors. Career Butterworth started his career aged 17, as a cartoonist drawing sports caricatures for the Stockport Advertiser, Cheshire Daily Echo, and County Express in the Stockport and Greater Manchester areas. He was offered full-time employment in 1923 with the Manchester Evening Chronicle. At this time he was signing his works 'Gee Bee'. From 1932 he drew for the Kemsley Group of papers, including the Daily Dispatch, and Empire News. During this period, Butterworth was illustrating stories for various newspapers and publications including programs for the Manchester United football organization, the Evening and Sunday Chronicle. With war declared against Nazi Germany, in September 1939, Butterworth took the role as political cartoonist. His daily cartoons during this period proved to be so successful, both nationally and internationally that he soon came to the attention of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Needless to say neither was impressed. During World War II his cartoon Maltese Cross in the Daily Dispatch partly resulted in the island receiving the George Cross in April 1942. After the end of the second world war, Butterworth had to find new subjects. His attentions soon turned to Joseph Stalin, and the then perceived threat of the Soviet Union. During this time he also poured scorn on Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the 1945-1951 Labour Government. These years of austerity, rationing, world crisis, and financial upheaval were all easy ammunition for his popular daily cartoons. Butterworth abruptly halted his relationship with the Manchester United upon the death of many of his beloved \\"Busby Babes,\\" and fellow Manchester journalists in the Munich Air Disaster. He stated at the time that he could not find folly in it anymoreInterview, G.A.M. Butterworth (son), December 18, 2015. Between 1956 and 1968, Butterworth found regular inspiration writing a daily comic strip \\"The Daily Dees,\\" which chronicled a family with two girls and a boy. In his retirement in New Milton and Anglesey, Wales he painted in oils, mainly landscapes. He was reported at the time to have had a keen, mischievous political brain. Posthumous An exhibition of George Butterworth's work was held at the Political Cartoon Gallery London September to October 2007. In 2007 a biography by Timothy Benson of George Butterworth was published by the Political Cartoon Society entitled Butterworth: The Political Cartoons of George Butterworth 1938 - 1953 and includes over 200 of his editorial cartoons. George's widow, Betty Butterworth, generously gave English Heritage a large collection of his original cartoons and ephemera. They are on display at their new home in Cornwall, Pendennis Castle.

The couple from Ogden identified Deering as the assailant who had also robbed them of $11 that night in Salt Lake City. Investigators found a .38 Colt automatic pistol that had been sold for $3 around May 12 to a pawnbroker near the Palace Casino in Reno, Nevada. The firearm was traced to Deering and was matched to the bullets from the crime scenes through ballistic fingerprinting. Arrest and confession On July 29, 1938, Deering was arrested in Hamtramck, Michigan on suspicion of robbing the Hamtramck Finance Company. Having already spent 17 years behind bars, Deering did not want to face another 15 years imprisonment in Michigan. Hoping to be executed after hearing of his mother's death, Deering confessed to kidnapping the Howes and killing Meredith in Salt Lake City. Deering stated that he ran away after the shooting, and read about Meredith's death in a newspaper on the following day. His statement mentioned killing another man on a freight train and disposing of the body in a swamp, though that victim remained unidentified. Investigators later determined that Deering had been responsible for the shootings of two police officers in Salt Lake City and another in Portland, Oregon. Deering was also implicated in the murder of George L. Olson in Twin Falls, Idaho and the torture-killing case of Hazel and Nancy Frome in Van Horn, Texas, but evidence was not found to connect him to those cases. Deering was charged with the murder of Meredith on August 1, and was extradited to Utah on August 6. Right before being placed on a train back to Salt Lake City, Deering stated: \\"I don't mind dying. I see the futility of it all.\\" Trial and incarceration Deering opposed the appointment of a defense attorney during his arraignment before Judge Herbert M. Schiller on August 11, 1938. His murder trial commenced on September 19 at the Third District Court under Judge Schiller while initially represented by attorney Edgar C. Jensen. Deering admitted his regret for shooting and killing Meredith to steal his automobile. He asked to be executed \\"without all the red tape and rigamarole of courts.\\" The trial was marked by an outburst from Deering against the court for entering a mandatory plea of not guilty on his behalf. At one point, Deering was restrained by handcuffs after violently protesting the need to call the elderly widow of Meredith as a witness, despite his confessions. Judge Schiller noted Deering's \\"most extraordinary attitude\\" in refusing counsel and seeking his \\"constitutional right\\" to plead guilty to face the death penalty. The jury delivered a guilty verdict on September 21 after only an hour of deliberation; Deering thanked them and said, \\"you've done your duty.\\" The court later appointed public defender Clifford L. Ashton to represent Deering, who requested execution by firing squad over the other option of hanging at his sentencing hearing on September 24. As no requests for retrial nor commutation of sentence were pursued, his execution date was reached in only about three months from his arrest. Deering's sister Dorothy DeVaney wrote to him, hoping that he would \\"fight the case\\", but to no avail. While awaiting his death sentence, Deering sought to be a model inmate and became popular with the prison guards. He publicly stated, \\"Build more athletic fields and gymnasiums ... Give children more play facilities to keep their minds on wholesome activities. Give them the chance to develop that I never had.\\" Execution Sugar House Prison on October 31, 1938. During the night of October 30, 1938, Deering ate a last meal of pheasant, which he requested because he had never tasted it before. He was joined by his young attorney along with prison warden Owen Nebeker and chaplain Jim B. Moreton. During his meal, Deering said, \\"From here on, I've got to be an actor ... Nobody must know what goes on inside of me.\\" He agreed to allow physicians to monitor his heart activity over the course of his execution, believed to be the first such experiment to be conducted. At 6:30 am on October 31, Deering was taken to a room at Sugar House Prison in the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City. 75 witnesses gathered to witness the event while blankets were placed over the windows to block the view from hundreds of curious spectators who had gathered outside. A guard placed a target over Deering's heart and a hood over his head. Prison doctor Stephen H. Besley connected sensors on Deering's wrists to an electrocardiogram, which indicated that his heart rate jumped from 72 beats per minute to over 180 when he was strapped to a chair in front of the firing squad. The five marksmen, each paid $50 by the county, were selected by Sheriff S. Grant Young. The names of the marksmen were kept secret; one was provided a rifle loaded with a blank cartridge so that they would not know who fired the lethal shot. After thanking the warden for treating him well, Deering spoke his last words: \\"Good-bye and good luck! Okay, let it go.\\" 22 seconds later, Deering was shot at 6:46 am. His heart entered into a spasm for 4 seconds and gradually stopped after 15.6 seconds. He continued to breathe and struggle in his chair for nearly a minute. Deering was pronounced dead at 6:48¬Ω am, 134.4 seconds after his heart had stopped. He was 40 years old. Aftermath On November 1, 1938, Doctor Besley discussed his observations of Deering with the press: \\"He put on a good front. The electrocardiograph film shows his bold demeanor hid the actual emotions pounding within him. He was scared to death.\\" Deering's eyes, which he had willed for corneal transplantation, were immediately removed, frozen, and flown via United Airlines to San Francisco. On November 8, a surgeon confirmed that tissue from Deering's corneas successfully restored sight to a 27-year- old blind man, whose name was withheld at the surgeon's request. Some of the corneal tissue was also implanted in the eyes of a four-year-old boy who had been blind since birth. Deering had previously offered the transplant to blind Utah County attorney Arnold C. Roylance, who was medically unable to accept the offer. Deering's body was donated to the medical department of the University of Utah, so that, in his own words, he could finally receive a \\"high class education\\". On December 28, 1938, Deering's case was featured in a broadcast of the true crime radio show Gang Busters.

In its literal or plain meaning, the verse means that God's commands are not overwhelming but rather close to human hearts and abilities to obey. As noted in the New Oxford Annotated Bible, \\"The covenant demand is not beyond human reach or understanding but has been graciously revealed... 'the word is near you.'\\"New Oxford Annotated Bible, Deut. 30:14. The full verse states: \\"It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' In general, the verse conforms with how \\"... the deuteronomic tradition believed its Torah to be an immediately accessible wisdom, neither distant nor wondrous.\\"Michael Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel, p. 540.  Jewish interpretations  The phrase \\"not in Heaven\\" is understood to justify human authority to interpret the Torah. The Talmud explains \\"[The Torah] is not in Heaven\\" to mean that the meaning of the Torah itself is to be uncovered not by prophets, or even God's miracles or words, but by humankind's interpretation and decision-making. In the story of the Oven of Akhnai, \\"Rabbi Yehoshua affirmed the independence of human interpretation from divine intervention since this is what God wills. In support he adduces the biblical statement that the Torah is 'not in heaven' ().\\" In the academic study of Jewish law, the verse \\"not in Heaven\\" serves as the Biblical grounding for the jurisprudential structure of halakhah (Jewish law). The source for Rabbinic authority is really from (According to the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do). As one author explains, thanks to the midrashic reading of the verse, \\"...God himself acquiesced in His exclusion from the halakhic process. Having revealed His will in Sinai in the grundnorm, He Himself, according to the Rabbinic explanation, entrusted the interpretation of His will to the Sages.\\"Roth, p.124. Cp.

These 26 highways are service roads constructed or old alignments maintained to provide access to private property or county highways whose access was compromised by the realignment of MD 2 and MD 4 in Calvert County. There are six signed mainline segments of MD 765 comprising the old alignment of the concurrency of MD 2 and MD 4 (hereafter referenced as MD 2-4) through Solomons, Lusby, St. Leonard, and Port Republic, and the county seat of Prince Frederick in southern Calvert County. There are also 20 unsigned sections of MD 765 south of Prince Frederick and along MD 2 between its junction with MD 4 in Sunderland and Owings in northern Calvert County. The portions of MD 765 that form the old alignment of Solomons Island Road were part of the original state road constructed as in the early 1910s, which ran the length of Calvert County from Solomons to Owings and continued north toward Annapolis. The highway was designated MD 2 in the late 1920s and extensively improved in the late 1930s and 1940s. The first portion of MD 765 was designated in the early 1950s when MD 2's bypass of Prince Frederick opened. Further sections of MD 765 were assigned between Sunderland and Owings when MD 2 was reconstructed north of MD 4 in the mid-1960s. All but one of the remaining portions of MD 765 were assigned following the relocation of MD 2-4 through Port Republic and St. Leonard in the early 1980s and through Lusby to Solomons in the late 1980s. Route description There are six mainline sections of MD 765: *MD 765R runs from MD 2 north to Dowell Road and MD 765Q within Solomons. *MD 765Q has a length of from Dowell Road and MD 765R in Solomons north to MD 2-4 near Lusby. *MD 765P extends from MD 2-4 near Lusby north to an entrance to Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. *MD 765N runs between a pair of intersections with MD 2-4 near St. Leonard. *MD 765 (without suffix) has a length of from MD 2-4 in St. Leonard north to MD 2-4 near Port Republic. *MD 765A extends from MD 2-4 near Prince Frederick to MD 2-4 in Prince Frederick. Solomons-Lusby MD 765R, which is known as Solomons Island Road South, begins at the ramp that MD 2 follows to join MD 4 northbound. MD 2 continues south a short distance to its terminus at Lore Road in Solomons. MD 765R passes a ramp from southbound MD 2-4 to MD 765R and passes by several shopping centers. Shortly before reaching its northern terminus, the state highway intersects Patuxent Point Parkway, which provides the only full service connection between the divided highway and the service road. MD 765R and MD 765Q have their northern and southern termini, respectively, at Dowell Road. Dowell Road heads east as a county highway and west as unsigned MD 2V, which provides access to the northbound direction of MD 2-4. View south from the north end of MD 765Q at MD 2/MD 4 near Lusby MD 765Q heads north as two-lane undivided H.G. Trueman Road from Dowell Road and veers away from the divided highway, which it continues to parallel from a distance. After meeting Southern Connector Boulevard, which heads west as unsigned MD 765Z, at a roundabout, the highway curves northeast to intersect MD 760 (Rousby Hall Road) and pass through the village center of Lusby. MD 765Q then curves north and then northwest, intersecting MD 497 (Cove Point Road). A park and ride lot is located on the southwest corner of this intersection. Following this, the road passes Middleham Chapel and the entrance to Calvert Cliffs State Park. The state highway intersects MD 2-4; its name changes to Pardoe Road on the west side of the divided highway. MD 765Q continues north a short distance on the west side of the divided highway, passing Sollers Wharf Road before turning east to its northern terminus at another intersection with MD 2-4 south of Johns Creek, a tributary of St. Leonard Creek. Lusby-St. Leonard There are two short mainline segments of MD 765 between Lusby and St. Leonard. MD 765P begins at MD 2-4 on the opposite side of Johns Creek from MD 765Q. The highway heads north as two-lane undivided Nursery Road parallel to the northbound side of the divided highway. MD 765P reaches its northern terminus when Nursery Road turns east to a barricade at a secondary entrance to Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. MD 765N begins a short distance north of MD 765P's northern end at a right- in/right-out intersection with southbound MD 2-4 opposite the divided highway's directional crossover intersection with Calvert Cliffs Parkway, which is the main entrance to the nuclear power station. MD 765N heads north as Saw Mill Road along the southbound side of MD 2-4 to a full service intersection with the divided highway opposite MD 765M (Flag Ponds Parkway) just south of MD 2-4's bridge over Quaker Swamp, a branch of St. Leonard Creek. St. Leonard-Port Republic MD 765, which is known as St. Leonard Road, begins at a full service intersection with MD 2-4 south of St. Leonard. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road and meets Calvert Beach Road at a roundabout in the center of St. Leonard. Calvert Beach Road, which is unsigned MD 765J, heads east to the Chesapeake Bay communities of Calvert Beach and Long Beach. Between St. Leonard and Port Republic, MD 765 intersects Western Shores Boulevard, which leads east to another beach community and west as unsigned MD 2J to MD 2-4. In Port Republic, the state highway intersects MD 509 (Governor Run Road), which heads east to Kenwood Beach, and unnamed MD 765B, which is signed as a westward extension of MD 509 to MD 2-4. MD 765 veers west and intersects Parkers Creek Road, which is unsigned MD 765O. Parkers Creek Road heads south to a full service intersection with MD 2-4 and north toward Scientists Cliffs. MD 765 reaches its northern terminus at a right-in/right-out intersection with northbound MD 2-4 opposite the divided highway's directional crossover intersection with MD 264. Prince Frederick MD 765A, which is known as Main Street, begins at an intersection with MD 2-4 south of Prince Frederick. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road through a forested area before reaching the center of the county seat, where the highway passes the county courthouse and several county government office buildings. MD 765 meets the eastern terminus of MD 231 (Church Street) and passes Armory Street, the original alignment of MD 2 that splits northeast toward the county fairgrounds, before reaching its northern terminus at a tangent intersection with MD 2-4. History Solomons Island Road was one of the original state roads marked for improvement to form a statewide system by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway was graded and surfaced as an improved dirt road from Owings south to Hunting Creek in 1910 and 1911 and from there to Prince Frederick between 1911 and 1913. Solomons Island Road from Prince Frederick south to Solomons was graded and surfaced as a dirt road in 1913 except for two segments: a wide shell road was built through Solomons and a wide gravel road was built for through Lusby. This highway was improved to a gravel road for its whole length and several dangerous curves were modified by 1919. When the roads commission assigned numbers to state highways in 1927, Solomons Island Road was designated MD 2. By 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission proposed Solomons Island Road be widened from to from Owings to MD 509. The first upgrades to MD 2 between Solomons and Prince Frederick occurred in 1937, when the highway was widened and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel from Prince Frederick south to Port Republic. The highway was upgraded from Port Republic south through St. Leonard to beyond Quaker Swamp, with several relocations including a relocation at that creek, in 1939 and 1940. The MD 2 reconstruction continued south a few miles to the northern end of Lusby in 1942, a stretch widened to and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel. The highway through Lusby was relocated, reconstructed, and surfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1944. The gravel portions of MD 2 from Port Republic to Lusby were bituminous stabilized in 1946. The reconstruction of MD 2 from Prince Frederick to Solomons concluded in 1949 when the highway from Solomons north to the southern end of Lusby was relocated, resurfaced, and surfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel. MD 765 northbound on Main Street in Prince Frederick MD 2 originally followed Armory Road through the northern part of Prince Frederick. By 1946, the highway had been relocated to its modern alignment and paved north of Armory Road. The bypassed portion of Armory Road was marked as MD 750 by 1950 but may have been removed from the state highway system by 1952. MD 2 was widened to and resurfaced with bituminous concrete through Prince Frederick in 1950. This improvement occurred contemporaneously with or shortly before the construction of the Prince Frederick bypass; MD 2 moved to the new wide bituminous stabilized gravel highway in the autumn of 1951. The bypass was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1954 and 1955. By 1956, the old road through the county seat was marked as the first section of MD 765. The next sections of MD 765 to be designated were between Sunderland and Owings when MD 2 was relocated north of MD 4 in 1965. Unsuffixed MD 765 was assigned to the old road through Port Republic and St. Leonard after MD 2-4 was relocated to its present course to the west of those communities in 1981. The four mainline portions of MD 765 through the Lusby and Solomons areas were designated when MD 2-4 was relocated through those communities in 1987. MD 765R and MD 765Q did not originally connect; the highways were connected when a new road was built between them parallel to MD 2-4 in 1999. Junction lists All sections of MD 765 are entirely within Calvert County. MD 765R and MD 765QMD 765PMD 765NMD 765MD 765A=Auxiliary routes There are 20 other sections of MD 765 that comprise very short sections of the old alignment of MD 2 or form service roads or connectors from or between MD 2 and MD 765.

A year later, it became only the second of his piano sonatas to be published. Movements Schubert, piano sonata opus 53, first movement thumb I. Allegro vivace - 4/4 D major. The autograph has alla breve Allegro while the first edition (published during Schubert's lifetime and thus probably a revision) gives common-time Allegro vivace - this is uncharacteristically quick for a Schubert allegro, a marking he often qualified with moderato. The first movement is unrelentingly energetic, ranging from ebullient to stormy to triumphant. A fanfare-like introduction introduces the primary thematic material featured in this movement and ultimately throughout the sonata. In a characteristic Schubertian gesture, this theme is immediately repeated in the minor - also typical is the modulation through remote keys as the exposition is spun out. The cheerful second subject, with its vacillating high-low pattern, is reminiscent of yodeling. This theme is also similar to the opening of the Lied Das Heimweh (homesickness), composed at the same time. The development section features a grandiose chordal fanfare theme based on the first subject, also used in the coda closing the movement. Some of the most challenging writing in Schubert's solo piano oeuvre is found here, with the relentless triplets providing opportunity for virtuosic display. thumb II. Con moto - 3/4 A major, ABABA form. Like the first movement, the second movement is unusual in its quickness, signified by the unique tempo marking. A driving pulse written into the phrasing augments an otherwise wistful melody in the A section. The bold, expansive B section features a novel syncopated dotted rhythm that produces stops and starts of momentum and is used to dramatic effect. Several recitatives and meditative digressions punctuate the piece, which has a sophisticated texture and inventive writing in general. The syncopated rhythm of theme B is merged with theme A for its final appearance, and the movement dies off with a brief and shadowy outro. thumb III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace - Trio - 3/4 D major, Trio in G major. In the athletic Scherzo, Schubert expands a jaunty dotted-note idea to its limits, with thick chordal writing and frequent abrupt changes of register, texture, and key. Hemiola is used extensively - a strong 3/2 pulse pervades the 3/4 Scherzo. The stately trio, with its even, lyrical repeated chords and distant modulations, contrasts considerably with the kinetic music surrounding it. thumb IV. Rondo: Allegro moderato - 4/4 D major. ABACA form. The playful and innocent march-like rondo theme, repeated twice with increasing rhythmic subdivision and decoration, is punctuated by two contrasting episodes, each with their own stormy central sections. The B episode features quick scales passed between the hands as a simple staccato phrase is developed. The C episode features a lyrical repeated chord theme that digresses into a dramatic minor section. After the last highly ornamented statement of the rondo theme, a valedictory coda brings the work to a quiet and understated close. The work takes approximately 40 minutes to perform, one of the longest and most ambitious of Schubert‚Äôs solo works, especially up to this point.  Themes/Motifs  Schubert employs a focused and sophisticated treatment of motifs throughout the piece, creating a cohesive identity and aesthetic for the sonata. Repeated chords: Repeated chords (and less specifically, successive chords) pervade the work, dominating the texture, appearing at conspicuous points, and holding important structural functions. Allegro vivace - the first bar of the sonata establishes this pattern with four repeated eighth-note chords. This pattern is a formal motive of the movement and as such is expanded upon extensively throughout the first subject and development. Con moto - the primary texture of the first section is successive chords; sets of repeated chords are the focus of several cadential sections as well as the final climax of the piece. Scherzo - again a texture of successive chords dominates, and the basic opening phrase that seeds most of the music ends in a twice-repeated chord emphasized by hemiola. The trio is based heavily on repeated chords throughout. Rondo - the theme of the second episode is an extended repeated chord melody that receives developmental treatment. Stepwise harmonic and melodic motion in the diatonic scale: The simple and fundamental diatonic scale, particularly an ascent often followed by a descent, is used to create a rich variety of melodies and textures. Allegro vivace - the opening bars outline a diatonic ascent from D to A (12345). The second theme outlines the same pattern, this time descending as well. The unaltered diatonic scale appears prominently in the final lines of the exposition and recapitulation, ascending and descending across the entire keyboard. Con moto - the first and second themes are both based on phrases outlining the same ascending-descending stepwise movement (1232176). Scherzo - the primary melodic motif is a four-note diatonic ascent, appearing in several positions on the scale. At the same time, the harmonic motion of phrases consistently follows a descending diatonic pattern. The parts of the trio that are not repeated chords (see first motif above) are almost all adjacent diatonic moves. The final cadential phrases in the right hand are diatonic descents from 4 to 1, an inversion of the main motif. Rondo - the first episode's theme is based entirely on a four-note diatonic ascent and descent, repeated dozens of times in various positions. Eighth-note triplets, especially in pairs: Though not a major formal motive outside of the first movement (which is not to be understated), similar triplet groups appear prominently throughout the sonata. Allegro vivace - juxtaposed with the straight duple-meter eighth-note repeated chords, triplets pervade the movement, appearing in nearly every bar and creating a strong undercurrent that frequently spirals into outbursts. Scherzo - in a manner similar to the first movement's exposition, the second phrase of the scherzo‚Äôs first subject comprises an eighth-note triplet pattern that contrasts rhythmically with the preceding material. This pattern returns triumphantly in the bass to end the second section. Rondo - triplet pairs are a primary feature of the main theme, and appear conspicuously as one-bar flourishes in the first episode, which is otherwise in strict duple meter with uniform sixteenth notes. Alpine aesthetic: Figuration idiomatic of horns Schubert's correspondence shows he was struck and inspired by the mountainous beauty of Bad Gastein, and this master of inventive pianistic imitation and scene-building (e.g. the babbling brooks and spinning wheels of the Lieder) achieves a convincing romanticized alpine aesthetic. This is achieved in several ways; foremost is by creating a sense of scale. Expansive passages with widely spaced, fully voiced chords and syncopated rhythms, often accompanied by unprepared modulations and sudden changes of texture, convey a sense of awe and grandeur. These passages appear prominently in the first two movements in particular, where they appear as conspicuous digressions and intense climaxes; the second subject of the Con moto primarily employs this and other atmosphere-building effects. The pastoral alpine atmosphere is strengthened by frequent writing idiomatic of the natural horn. Schubert uses this device frequently in Lieder - it features in Der Lindenbaum and is a repeated device in Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin, signifying the hunter. Ian Bostridge states in Schubert's Winter Journey: \\"The horn call - last heard in Der Lindenbaum - is such a feature of the Romantic imagination that it is not surprising to come across it\\". The figure appears repeatedly in the first three movements; in the B section of the Con moto, there is an extended pianissimo passage composed entirely of this figuration, clearly conveying horns heard in the distance. Finally, the second subject of the Allegro being highly reminiscent of yodeling was probably a deliberate gesture explicitly signifying the Alps.

First tour's itinerary Their matches, opponents, and scores were as follows: * Tuesday, 24 October 1967: The Galahs began their trip with an exhibition match of Australian rules against a Northern Territory Football League representative side in Darwin. Played in sweltering conditions in front of a crowd of 4,000 spectators at Gardens Oval, the Galahs defeated the NTFL by 69 points, 18.15 (123) to 7.12 (54), with Royce Hart booting seven goals. * Saturday, 28 October 1967: Civil Service, a Dublin club team, preliminary warm-up match. The Galahs won by two points.Jim Stynes' father, Brian, played in this match for the Civil Service team. (Burke, 1998, p.12) * Sunday, 29 October 1967: The 1967 All-Ireland Senior Football Champions Meath, the first touring match, played at Croke Park, and won by The Galahs 3-16 (25) to 1-10 (13) in front of 23,149 people. * Tuesday, 31 October 1967: Exhibition match of Australian Rules Football, conducted in heavy rain, under lights, at London's Crystal Palace between \\"Australia\\" and \\"Britain\\". The Britain team was composed mainly of expatriates, plus several of The Galahs (including Alex Jesaulenko). Australia beat Britain 101 to 75. * Saturday, 4 November: Mayo, the 1967 Connacht Senior Football Championship winners, played at Croke Park (incidentally the first time Gaelic football was played on a Saturday afternoon at the venue), and won by The Galahs 2-12 (18) to 2-5 (11) in front of an attendance of 20,121. * Sunday, 5 November: New York, played at Gaelic Park, New York City. The Galahs lost the match 4-8 (20) to 0-5 (5), the visitors not managing a score after half time. There were many brawls during the match, with the Galahs coming off second best in all of them. Hassa Mann, king-hit behind the play, had his jaw broken in three places. Ron Barassi had his nose broken by a giant New York narcotics detective (Brendan Tumulty), who broke his own thumb in the process of hitting Barassi.Burke, 1998, p.15. Burke does not supply the match's final score except to say that the New York Irish were in front 11-5 at half-time, and that the Galahs were unable to add to their half-time score.

Head (vessel) Evidence for carbonates on Mars was first discovered in 2008. Previously, most remote sensing instruments such as OMEGA and THEMIS‚Äîsensitive to infrared emissivity spectral features of carbonates‚Äîhad not suggested the presence of carbonate outcrops, at least at the 100 m or coarser spatial scales available from the returned data. Though ubiquitous, a 2003 study of carbonates on Mars showed that they are dominated by Magnesite (MgCO3) in Martian dust had mass fractions less than 5% and could have formed under current atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, with the exception of the surface dust component, by 2007 carbonates had not been detected by any in situ mission, even though mineralogic modeling did not preclude small amounts of calcium carbonate in Independence class rocks of Husband Hill in Gusev crater (note: An IAU naming convention within Gusev is not yet established).  Remote sensing data  The first successful identification of a strong infrared spectral signature from surficial carbonate minerals of local scale (< 10 km¬≤) was made by the MRO-CRISM team. Spectral modeling in 2007 identified a key deposit in Nili Fossae dominated by a single mineral phase that was spatially associated with olivine outcrops. The dominant mineral appeared to be magnesite, while morphology inferred with HiRISE and thermal properties suggested that the deposit was lithic. Stratigraphically, this layer appeared between phyllosilicates below and mafic cap rocks above, temporally between the Noachian and Hesperian eras. Even though infrared spectra are representative of minerals to less than ‚âà0.1 mm depths (in contrast to gamma spectra which are sensitive to tens of cm depths), stratigraphic, morphologic, and thermal properties are consistent with the existence of the carbonate as outcrop rather than alteration rinds. Nevertheless, the morphology was distinct from typical terrestrial sedimentary carbonate layers suggesting formation from local aqueous alteration of olivine and other igneous minerals. However, key implications were that the alteration would have occurred under moderate pH and that the resulting carbonates were not exposed to sustained low pH aqueous conditions even as recently as the Hesperian. This increased the likelihood of local and regional scale geologic conditions on Mars that were favorable to analogs of terrestrial biological activity over geologically significant intervals. , the absence of more extensive carbonate deposits on Mars was thought by some scientists to be due to global dominance of low pH aqueous environments.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Even the least soluble carbonate, siderite (FeCO3), precipitates only at a pH greater than 5. Evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface began to increase in 2008 when the TEGA and WCL experiments on the 2007 Phoenix Mars lander found between 3‚Äì5wt% calcite (CaCO3) and an alkaline soil. In 2010 analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16‚Äì34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, most likely precipitated from carbonate-bearing solutions under hydrothermal conditions at near-neutral pH in association with volcanic activity during the Noachian era. After Spirit Rover stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called \\"Comanche.\\" Carbonates (calcium or iron carbonates) were discovered in a crater on the rim of Huygens Crater, located in the Iapygia quadrangle. The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture. These kind of carbonates only form when there is a lot of water. They were found with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments. It is supposed that billions of years age Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried. The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of limestone.

Dante's View panorama before sunrise Etymology Dante's View is named from Dante Alighieri, who wrote the Divina Commedia (Divine Comedy), in which there are described the nine circles of Hell, the seven terraces of Purgatory and the nine spheres of Paradise. In April 1926, some businessmen of the Pacific Coast Borax Company, informed of the touristic attractiveness of Death Valley, were trying to pick the best view of Death Valley. They had nearly chosen Chloride Cliff in the Funeral Mountains when the Deputy Sheriff of Greenwater, Charlie Brown, carried them from this peak a little distance to the Black Mountains. The group was immediately persuaded and promptly called this point Dante's View. Dante's View to North Geological Dante's View is part of the Black Mountains, a part of Amargosa Range, that was geological Mesozoic volcanoes. These mountains were created when the surface of the earth was being stretched, forming a horst or a pulling force, forming grabens. The crust ruptured because of this force, and as a result, lava erupted and ended up deposited on top of the preceding sedimentary rock. Dante's View panorama In popular culture Dante's View was used as a filming location for the 1977 film Star Wars as the characters overlook the fictional Tatooine spaceport of Mos Eisley (which was added into the scene as a matte painting).That view point is Dante's View.

He was a hard-working, competitive defender, good in the air (though less good on the ground), and his authority on the field was such that he was first chosen to captain the Birmingham side at the age of only 19. Biography Gallagher was born in Liverpool, and began his football career as a schoolboy with home-town club Liverpool When he left school at 15 he signed for Birmingham City as a trainee. He turned professional on his 17th birthday and made his first team debut in October 1973 against Arsenal at Highbury. He made over 20 appearances in his debut season, and from then on hardly missed a game until a broken leg sustained in a car accident kept him out for several months. He scored on his return to first team duty in December 1977, and for the remainder of his Birmingham career he was virtually ever- present. It was due in no small part to Gallagher's partnerships with the likes of Kenny Burns and Colin Todd in the Birmingham defence that the club kept its First Division status for all but his last season with them. In 1980‚Äì81 he helped them gain promotion back to the top flight, from which they had been relegated the previous year, and was awarded a testimonial match against Aston Villa in recognition of ten years' service. Also that season he was capped for England B in a 1‚Äì0 win against Australia at his home ground of St Andrew's. He left Birmingham having made 335 appearances and scored 23 goals. Gallagher joined fellow First Division club Wolverhampton Wanderers for a fee of ¬£350,000 before the 1981‚Äì82 season. Birmingham were unable to profit from the sale because when Wolves were declared bankrupt in 1982 they still owed most of the fee. Gallagher left Wolves in acrimonious circumstances. Already in the reserves despite being one of the club's highest paid players, his contract was cancelled by the club, citing his failure to turn up for an official team photograph, though the player believes this was an excuse for cutting costs. After two months unemployed he signed for West Ham United for the remainder of the 1982‚Äì83 season. He then moved on to Burnley, where within months of signing he was sent on loan to Fourth Division Halifax Town. It appeared that his fitness was no longer adequate to cope with the demands of League football. Despite only playing eight first-team games in his first three years with the club, in 1986‚Äì87 he played a full season, starting 41 games in the League and playing a significant part in Burnley retaining their Football League status. He retired at the end of that season, when his contract at Burnley expired, at the relatively young age of 32. He went on to manage several non-league clubs in the Midlands, and had a spell as community liaison officer with Birmingham City. He later worked for Land Rover and part- time for the Press Association, and has been involved in corporate hospitality at Birmingham matches. In 2012, Gallagher was one of seven former players elected to Birmingham City's Hall of Fame.

With Kathrin R√∂ggla and Daniel Kehlmann, he is among other contemporary Austrian authors being perceived as significantly shaping the literary discussion in Austria. Life The former writer of advertising copy and taxi driver emerged with his 1998 debut novel Carl Haffner's Love of the Draw. The novel describes the life of chess master Carl Schlechter. The book received several awards and has been translated into other languages, but did not make it onto the bestseller lists. The novel has autobiographical aspects: Thomas Glavinic played his first chess game at the age of five and in 1987 he achieved second place in the Austrian chess rankings for his age group. The novel Herr Susi (Mr. Susi) followed in 2000. Written in hard prose, it is a statement against the football business, and received mainly negative reviews from the critics. In 2001, the criminal novel Der Kameram√∂rder (The Camera Murderer) (awarded the Friedrich-Glauser-Prize at the Criminale) was published and was enthusiastically celebrated by the feuilletons due to its criticism of the media. In 2004, Glavinic succeeded in convincing both critics (no. 1 on the ORF critics best list) and readers (no. 1 on the Austrian bestseller list) with his satiric development-novel Wie man leben soll (How to Live), written from the perspective of the indefinite \\"one\\". In August 2006, the novel Die Arbeit der Nacht (Night Work) was released and scored no. 1 on the critic's list again in the same month. His novel, Das bin doch ich (That's Me), appeared in summer of 2007 and was nominated for the German Book Prize. It made it onto the short list, a selection of six of the twenty authors originally chosen. Thomas Glavinic is married and lives with his wife and son in Vienna.

Although the size of medical teams vary, ADFA attempts to ensure that a typical team comprises orthopaedic surgeons, an anaesthetist and theatre nurse with additional specialised support incorporated into the team such as a physiotherapist, plaster technician and orthopaedic technician. Other speciality team members include gastroenterology and urology. ADFA has also developed a relationship with The University of Western Australia and sends academic staff to conduct medical student teaching. There are 2-4 visits to each location per year. The organisation has been recognized by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and the Australian Orthopaedic Association. With an operating budget of less than $200,000 per annum ADFA relies on the support of corporate partners, donations, fund raising activities and volunteers to maintain its core business. At each location, teams work very closely with the local medical staff with an aim to provide sustainable service provision. There is reciprocal learning and teaching between the visiting and local medical staff. Current work There are three locations where the charity has established programmes of medical aid: Somalia, Madagascar and Ethiopia. Somalia Original efforts were based in Bosaso in the north, in Puntland on the Gulf of Aden following the 2005 tsunami which affected the area. Visiting teams of orthopaedic surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists have carried out consultations in clinics and performed many operations on Somali people, injured civilians in the clan fighting and civil war. Visits to Bosaso have been temporarily suspended due to increasing political tension. However work has continued in Hargeisa, Somaliland. The first visit to Hargeisa Group Hospital was in 2007 and since then teams have been visiting 2-3 times a year. Work there includes orthopaedic consultation, teaching and performing operations as well as medical student teaching in conjunction with the University Medical faculty. ADFA has also built a relationship with Edna Aden Maternity Hospital and in 2013 aided to fund the construction of a radiology building. As well as the medical and educational assistance provided in Hargeisa, other capacity building achievements include the renovation of the hospital laundry and two operating theatres. Multiple sea container loads of medical and hospital equipment have been despatched from the port of Fremantle, Western Australia to Bosaso and Hargeisa as well as many kilograms worth of air freight. Madagascar Regular visits have been made to Toliara in the southwest of the country and Antananarivo on the east coast, providing orthopaedic and gastroenterology services to patients at the General Hospital, the Clinique St Lucque, the Military Hospital and the University Hospital. A Urology programme has also been set up. Teams from all three specialty areas provide consultation, teaching and procedures. Much endoscopic equipment has been donated. Teams have been able to train local medical staff in orthopaedics, gastroenterology and urology to ensure that services are sustainable and readily available outside of team visits. Multiple sea containers of surgical and endoscopic equipment have been sent. Ethiopia Regular operating and teaching assignments are carried out at the Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Hospital in Addis Ababa. Over the years that ADFA have been visiting Tikur Anbessa, they have helped build the orthopaedic training program and in 2013 there are 16 orthopaedic residents in training, up from just a few five years earlier. ADFA provides basic orthopaedic surgical skills courses for these trainees. Furthermore, it has helped establish a talipes program based on education, early referral and assessment as well as treatment for children with talipes. The latest capacity building project at Tikur Anbessa is aid with building two new specific orthopaedic operating theatres which begin construction in 2013. Multiple sea containers of medical and equipment have assembled and sent from Claremont, Western Australia since 2007.

Schubert abandoned the C major sonata, and only the first two movements were fully completed, with the trio section of the third movement also written in full. The minuet section of the third movement is incomplete and contains unusual harmonic changes, which suggests it was there Schubert had become disillusioned and abandoned the movement and later the sonata. The final fourth movement is also incomplete, ending abruptly after 272 bars. The fragments of the sonata survived in Schubert's manuscripts, and later the work was collected and published in its incomplete form in 1861. Movements I. Moderato C major, 4/4 time, sonata form Duration approximately 15-18 minutes II. Andante C minor, 6/8 time, five- part rondo form Duration approximately 10 minutes III. Menuetto: Allegretto - Trio A-flat major, 3/4 time, incomplete ternary form. Fragment (ends at measure 80 after the main theme returns in the B part of the menuetto) Very unusually, the opening theme is immediately repeated, slightly embellished, in A major, and the reprise also begins in this key. Presumably the minuet would have then returned to A-flat major. The trio is in the parallel minor, notated enharmonically as G-sharp minor. Fragment duration approximately ? minutes IV. Rondo: Allegro C major. Fragment (ends 32 measures after the development starts) Even in this truncated form, the sonata lasts approximately 30 to 35 minutes in performance. Structure Ernst Krenek outlined the structure of each of the work's four movements in notes that he contributed to a recording by Ray Lev in 1947. Krenek elaborates on how he composed a completion, included in the recording, for the unfinished movements. According to Krenek: * The first movement introduces \\"the energetically pulsating rhythm which runs nearly through the entire piece.\\" Unusually, the second theme is initially in B minor, not the expected dominant of G major, which appears only toward the end of the exposition. The development likewise stresses B minor until a false recapitulation in another unexpected key, B major; the actual recapitulation follows closely in F major, and C major finally makes its return with a forte restatement of the first theme. \\"The second theme now appears in A minor, and the coda turns to A flat, a key that was touched upon early in the beginning of the movement, so that the key scheme of the whole is rounded out with admirable logic.\\" * The second movement is in five-part rondo form, \\"curiously animated by relentless drive.\\" Its first theme, in C minor, incorporates downward skips in sevenths; running sixteenth notes and dramatic accents characterize its second, in A-flat major. The running sixteenths continue as the first theme returns, succeeded by a repeat of the second theme in C major and a final, quiet statement of the first theme to complete the movement. * The fragmentary third movement rapidly modulates from A-flat to A major shortly after its beginning, \\"a very unusual move,\\" at which point Schubert ceased composition. Krenek speculates that Schubert may have intended to complete the movement \\"with a recapitulation symmetrically returning from A to A-flat major shortly before the end.\\" In his completion, Krenek \\"wrote a brief development section, re-introduced the theme in A and returned to A-flat, adding a few measures of transition to A-flat minor, which is [enharmonically] the key of the trio, an exceptionally charming lyrical item.\\" * For the fragmentary fourth movement, Schubert completed the first and second themes of the exposition and introduced a third theme in A minor, derived from the first, to open the development before leaving off work on this movement in rondo-sonata form. Krenek indicates his completion elaborated the idea of the third theme and \\"followed it up with a swiftly modulating development of the first theme and a normal recapitulation\\" of slightly shorter length than the exposition. His coda takes the third theme as its basis and refers back to the first theme of the first movement, \\"an idea to which I felt entitled since Schubert had hinted at it at the end of the finale of the Sonata in A major.\\" Completions Given its large scope and the extent of material that Schubert left for the incomplete movements, this sonata has inspired various composers and performers to undertake completions. Some of their efforts, particularly those penned by performers, have appeared on records. Among them are the following: *Ludwig Stark published a completion in 1877.Benson (2008), p. 35 *Armin Knab wrote a completion of the sonata in 1920, which was published by Edition Peters, edited by Heinz Wegener, in 1962.Edition Peters VN 12148 ‚Äì 8376Deutsch (1978), p. 530 In 1920 Knab published an essay entitled \\"Schuberts unvollendete Klaviersonate in C-dur und ihre Erg√§nzung\\", which appeared in the Deutsche Musik-Zeitung.See Willi Kahl: Verzeichnis des Schrifttums √ºber Franz Schubert 1828 ‚Äì 1928 (Regensburg, : 1938), p.123, entry 1482. *Ernst Krenek wrote his completion, mentioned above, at the request of his friend, the pianist and composer Eduard Erdmann, who wished to add the sonata to his repertoire. Krenek himself dated that request to 1922. Other sources date his completion to 1921. Krenek's completion was published by Universal Edition in 1923. It was recorded at least three times. The first recording was in the aforementioned performance by Ray Lev on a set of 78 RPM disks issued by the American Concert Hall Society label; the second was performed by Friedrich W√ºhrer on a monaural LP issued by American Vox Records (later reissued on CD by Bearac). A later recording is by Stanislav Khristenko on Toccata Classics TOCC 0298 (CD marked as first volume of Krenek's piano works). *Walter Rehberg wrote a completion in 1927, published by in 1930.Benson, 2008. p.VBenson (2008), p. 24 *Nikolai Zhilyayev wrote a completion in 1932 (–º–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ 4.IV.1932, VN 12596). *Harold Truscott published a completion of the Minuet (3rd movement) in 1957. *Paul Badura- Skoda published a completion in 1976.

It tells the story of a message of intelligent extraterrestrial origin received by SETI scientists. The Hercules Text was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1986. Science fiction author Michael Swanwick said, in an overview of McDevitt's work, \\"Jack's first novel, The Hercules Text, appeared in 1986 as an Ace Special, putting him in the august company of such luminaries as William Gibson, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Lucius Shepard. It was a good book.\\" Plot summary The story emphasizes the various characters' reactions to the event, according to their specific scientific backgrounds. Examples include a priest's speculations on the implications for religion, a psychologist's theorizing about the aliens' psyches, the scientists' consideration of the implications of the new knowledge for their own specialties, and the president's concern for the implications for national defense. The novel is set in an ongoing Cold War scenario. Unlike typical first contact stories, there is no dialogue between the senders of the message and mankind, as the received radio signals have traveled through space for one and a half million years. The extraterrestrial message The message is received with a large radio telescope, the fictional Hercules Array, which was built on the far side of the Moon. It is later discovered that the message was sent with an artificial pulsar built by the alien race. This pulsar with the name Althea has been known by the scientists for years. It was believed to be a normal pulsar. However, what made it special was its almost perfectly regular interval between the observed pulses. One day, some of the pulses suddenly fail to appear. This incident draws more attention to this particular pulsar, as the newly discovered gaps show a remarkable pattern. The first gap consists of one missing pulse, the second of two missing pulses and the third gap consists of four missing pulses. The following gaps also consist of numbers representing powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ...). The transmission of these numbers goes on for a couple of days until the pulsar falls completely silent. The silence lasts for several weeks, until it breaks again. This time, not just a simple sequence of numbers is received by the Hercules Array. Now, a very large and complex amount of binary data is sent from somewhere close to Althea. Scientists are able to decipher this data. It consists of several mathematical and physical formulae and simple graphical information. Later, more complex information is found, e.g., parts of the sender's DNA, schematics for very advanced technology, philosophical texts or poems. Publication history The Hercules Text has been rewritten by Jack McDevitt, before being re-published in the year 2000 as part of the two-novel- book Hello Out There (). The story received some changes, taking into account the end of the Cold War and some technical developments such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Internet.

They were the first releases for Atomic Games who went on to have a long career in the wargame industry. Like earlier computer adaptions of the pen-and-paper wargame genre, V4V used a hex-based map covering its area of action and used military markers to indicate the location of various units. However, V4V used a much simpler user interface where commands were given by point-and-click and dragging the units on-screen with the mouse, compared to arcane commands and map coordinates used in earlier games. At the same time, the game engine was able to simulate many operational factors that earlier games like Squad Leader had to ignore in order to avoid overloading the user with minutia. The result was a wargame that was both easy to play and had considerably more operational detail at the same time. It was lauded by players and reviewers, who called it a \\"must have\\". The original scenario, D-Day Utah Beach, was a best-seller and was followed by three additional scenario packs. The system was written so that the scenarios plugged into a common base application, allowing users to launch newer games from whichever scenario they purchased first. Games Four games were produced in the series: D-Day Utah Beach * V for Victory: D-Day Utah Beach : Covers operations in the Utah Beach and Cotentin Peninsula during the weeks after the initial D-Day invasions. Includes an optional scenario where the original airborne landing areas on the west coast of the peninsula were used. Velikiye Luki * V for Victory: Velikiye Luki : This scenario pack covers the Soviet offensive against the German occupation during the Battle for Velikiye Luki in late 1942. Market-Garden * V for Victory: Market-Garden : Covers Operation Market Garden and various actions by the units involved. Gold-Juno-Sword * V for Victory: Gold-Juno-Sword : Revisits the D-Day beaches, this time covering the operations in the British and Canadian sectors and their battle to take Caen. Reception A 1993 survey of wargames gave by a second reviewer V for Victory: D-Day Utah Beach four stars out of five, describing it as \\"perhaps the smoothest conversion of a boardgame-style wargame to computer format ever done\\". He gave V for Victory II: Velikiye Luki and V for Victory III: Market Garden three-plus and four stars, respectively. A third reviewer criticized Velikiye Luki and Market Garden as buggy and flawed. While praising V for Victory: Gold-Juno-Swords documentation and SVGA graphics, he stated that the fourth game \\"succeeds only a technological level, bereft of soul\\" and compared the series to \\"a line of books without an editor\\". The reviewer concluded that \\"Three-Sixty's reputation in the hobby has suffered a major blow\\". In 1994, PC Gamer US named Utah Beach the 14th best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \\"The V for Victory series is quite simply the most playable war games available, with an easy-to-master interface and admirable depth of game play.\\" They continued, \\"We single out Utah Beach because it launched the series ‚Äî but by all means, check out Velikiye Luki, Gold*Juno*Sword, and Market Garden, too.\\" The V for Victory series collectively won Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1992 \\"Game of the Year\\" award. The magazine's Brian Walker wrote that it \\"achieved what many computer wargames have been trying to do for years: successfully convert a board wargame onto computer.\\" Computer Games likewise named it the year's best wargame.

Biography Whelan was born September 1808, in Philadelphia. Upon his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania in 1828, Dr. Whelan was commissioned a surgeon's mate in the U.S. Navy (25 March 1828). His service included duty in the West Indian Squadron, Naval Hospital, Pensacola, FL, where he was on duty during the prevalence there of smallpox and yellow fever, at Naval Hospital Chelsea, MA, and the Navy Yard, Philadelphia. He was promoted passed assistant surgeon in 1834 and was commissioned surgeon on 9 February 1837. From 1837 to 1840, he served in the Pacific aboard USS Falmouth. From 1843 to 1845 he served as fleet surgeon in the Mediterranean Squadron and again from 1849 to 1852. He was appointed Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery 23 September 1853, by the President Franklin Pierce and confirmed by Congress 23 January 1854. He held this office until his death 11 June 1865. He was thus Chief of Bureau during the American Civil War and the troubled period that preceded that conflict. The heavy responsibilities connected with the expansion of the Navy Medical Department and the increase of facilities necessary to meet the urgent demands made by the war, were borne to him. Among the highlights of his career as Chief are: *The construction and establishment of the naval hospitals at Annapolis, MD (1853) and at Memphis, TN, Mound City, IL, and New Bern, NC in the Civil War. *The establishment of the Naval Laboratory in Brooklyn, NY. The lab, headed by Surgeon Benjamin F. Bache and Passed Assistant Surgeon Edward R. Squibb, experimented with the production of chloroform and ether anesthesia. Squibb's major contribution was providing the Navy Medical Department with a reliable source of pure pharmaceuticals. In 1857, Dr. Squibb resigned from the Navy and founded the pharmaceutical house that bears his name. *Establishment of the first Navy hospital ship, USS Red Rover in 1862.

During a Jewish fast, no food or drink is consumed, including bread and water. The major fasts last over 25 hours, from before sundown on the previous night until after sundown on the day of the fast. Four other shorter fasts during the year begin at dawn and end after sunset. In Islam fasting mostly occurs during the month of Ramadan where Muslims fast for the whole duration of the month for around 30 continuous days. The fasting starts at dawn and ends by sunset where the first meal \\"break fast\\" is eaten. During the time of fast no form of food and drinks are consumed. Occurrence A break-fast follows each of the major Jewish fast days of Yom Kippur and Tisha B'Av, as well as the four minor fast days of Fast of Gedalia, Fast of Esther, Tenth of Tevet, and Seventeenth of Tammuz. Description Sometimes the fast is broken with tea and cake before eating a full meal. A drink of milk or juice before the post-fast meal helps the body to readjust and diminishes the urge to eat too much or too rapidly. Customs for the first food eaten after the Yom Kippur fast differ. Iranian Jews often eat a mixture of shredded apples mixed with rose water called \\"faloodeh seeb.\\" Polish and Russian Jews will have tea and cake. Syrian and Iraqi Jews eat round sesame crackers that look like mini-bagels. Turkish and Greek Jews sip a sweet drink made from melon seeds. Some people start with herring to replace the salt lost during fasting.Ethel G. Hofman, \\"International Yom Kippur break- fast dishes,\\" Jewish World Review, October 11, 2005. North African Jews prepare butter cookies known as rhuraieba (\\"ribo\\" among Moroccan Jews) for the meal after the Yom Kippur fast. Orthodox Jews generally do not eat meat or drink wine at the break-fast after Tisha B'Av because the burning of the Temple on the 9th of Av is said to have continued until noon on the 10th of Av. Even when the 9th of Av falls and Shabbat and Tisha B'Av is observed on the 10th, though all other Nine Days restrictions end with the fast, wine and meat are customarily still not consumed at the break fast.

He was a professor of contemporary history at Leiden University, former rector of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study between 1995 and 2002. In 1974, shortly after he was appointed to the chair of European history, Wesseling founded the \\"Center for the History of European Expansion and Reaction\\" within the Leiden University history department. It included specialists in China and India, as well as Indonesia, and funding was found to hire young specialists in Atlantic and African and other topics. Colonial history had been defunct for nearly two decades, but Wesseling insisted on its importance in Dutch and European history, although some colleagues remain dubious. The department was custodian of hundreds of kilometers of shelf space devoted to primary sources that were exploited by advanced students. An annual workshop brought in leading scholars and a new specialized journal Itinerario was launched. Wesseling published widely-read studies on imperialism, the partition of Africa, French military, intellectual, and cultural history, and a biography of Charles De Gaulle.

Congressman Brown was born in Kingwood, West Virginia in Preston County (then in Virginia) on April 7, 1856. He served as a member of the 62nd, 63rd, and 64th United States Congresses. He died in office on March 9, 1916. Early life Brown was the only child born to lawyer and former Congressman William G. Brown Sr., and his second wife, Margaret Gay Brown (d. 1913), who survived her husband by nearly two decades and was close to her son. This father was a leading Unionist during the American Civil War, sometimes called the \\"Father of West Virginia\\", and would be the first Congressman elected to West Virginia's 2nd Congressional district when the state was formed. Career William Jr. graduated from West Virginia University at Morgantown in 1877, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. The same year, he was admitted to the bar and opened his law practice in Preston County. Like his father, he also worked in banking. His father died in 1884, leaving a substantial estate. In 1896, young Brown lost his first bid to become a congressman. In 1910, voters elected Brown as a Democrat to the Sixty-second Congress. He was re-elected to the Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses. He served from March 4, 1911, until his death in Washington, D.C. on March 9, 1916.

The rich ate meat and white bread, the poor ate dark bread. Everyone drank beer as water was often too impure to drink. Fruits and vegetables were rarely eaten. Rich spices were used by the rich to offset the smells of old salted meat.  Diet  Vegetables were food for the poor, as the rich considered food from the ground to be lowly. Meat and fish, meanwhile, were luxuries reserved for the rich, who could choose among venison, beef, pork, lamb, fowl, salmon, eel, and shellfish. While meat was the main component of the upper-class diet, they occasionally took vegetables such as turnips, carrots, and radishes and fruits such as apples, plums, and woodland strawberries. They also ate desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, crystallized fruit, and syrup.Stephen Mennell (1996) All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present. University of Illinois Press. Among the rich private hospitality was an important item in the budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman. Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known. Bread was a staple of the Elizabethan diet, and people of different statuses ate bread of different qualities. The upper classes ate fine white bread called manchet while the poor ate coarse bread of barley or rye. Both the rich and the poor had imbalanced diets. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in scurvy.  Availability of food  Trade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread starvation and poverty. The success of the wool trading industry decreased attention on agriculture, resulting in further starvation of the lower classes. Cumbria, the poorest and most isolated part of England, suffered a six-year famine beginning in 1594. Diseases and natural disasters also contributed to the scarce food supply.Andrew B. Appleby (1978) Famine in Tudor and Stuart England. Stanford University Press. In the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did do so in France. Cities The population of London increased from 100,000 to 200,000 between the death of Mary Tudor in 1558 and the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. Inflation was rapid and the wealth gap was wide. Men, women, and children begged in the cities, as the children only earned sixpence a week. With the growth of industry, many landlords decided to use their land for manufacturing purposes, displacing the farmers who lived and worked there. Despite the struggles of the lower class, the government tended to spend money on wars and exploration voyages instead of on welfare.

Brislington Brislington is one of the largest suburbs of Bristol, and it is split into two sections for the purposes of local government; Brislington West and Brislington East. Notable places in the western section include Oasis Academy Brislington and the HTV studios. Arno's Vale The cemetery. Arno's Vale (also written Arnos Vale) is an area centred just over two miles from the city's centre point. It includes the 1837-begun, wooded Arno's Vale Cemetery, which occupies its grounds are statutorily listed (protected) in the mid- category, II*. was established in 1837. Burials ceased in 1998, but it has been kept open by volunteers since. It is part of the old Arno's Court Estate, one of four in Bristol where a single proprietor's manor house or grand country estate house has survived. Its current use is as a hotel (Arno's Manor Hotel). The remaining estate land includes Arno's Court Park. The park, which has views across Bristol, forms the peak of a crest between Knowle and Brislington in the city. The parkland core of Arno's estate, which includes the Parkside Hotel, Arno's Court Triumphal Arch and Black Castle Public House is beside the A4 road, south east of Bristol city centre. Roads to Bath and Wells run through the area. The estate has namesakes, derived from its Georgian owners, in two parts of the former British West Indies: St Vincent and Trinidad. Kensington Park Kensington Park is a small suburb. It is centred on the stretch of Bath Road which runs from Arno's Vale to Brislington village, and includes Kensington Park Road, Kings and Hampstead Roads, the southern end of Winchester and Wick Roads, Eagle Road and the northern parts of Water Lane. In the west it is bounded by Upper Knowle and to the north, east and south by Brislington. In terms of both its architectural style and demographics, it is similar to other areas of south Bristol such as Southville and Upper Knowle, although considerably smaller than either. Houses in the district are largely Victorian and early 20th century dwellings, and include many which are large and well-preserved. It is largely inhabited by urban professionals. On Bath Road, opposite the entrance to Kensington Park Road is a small memorial cross dedicated to people who lost their lives in the First World War.

It caters mainly for drag racing and speedway, although other events are held there regularly. Over 275,000 patrons attend the venue each year to many varied events. The Perth Motorplex holds rounds of the World Series Sprintcars championship. History Perth Motorplex (formerly Quit Motorplex) opened in 2000. It replaced the Claremont Speedway which was run at the Claremont Showground from 1927, and the Ravenswood Raceway Drag Racing strip. Many Claremont loyalists were unhappy with the change saying it destroyed almost 75 years of heritage as were many Ravenswood fans. Nonetheless the changes suited a growing population in Perth as the racetrack at Claremont was situated literally across the road from housing estates. Also, the owners of the Showgrounds, the Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia, while not wishing to lose their long time tenant, wanted to re- develop the main arena, which doubled as the speedway, into a fully grassed oval suitable for the Perth Royal Show and other outdoor festivals and concerts as well as for sports such as Australian rules football and cricket. The Motorplex actually brought drag racing some 45 km closer to Perth than Ravenswood, while for speedway fans the Motorplex saw the sport leave the city and move 26 km south. Speedway In the West Aussie tradition of having longer tracks than most of those in Australia, the Motorplex Speedway is a ‚Öì mile, dirt oval (Claremont was in length), and since its opening has hosted the Australian Sprintcar, Speedcar, Super Sedan and World Series Sprintcars Championships, as well as hosting rounds of the Speedcar Pro Series. It also hosts various Western Australian state championship meetings. On the inside of the main speedway track is a Motorcycle speedway track that is rarely for anything other than staging for race cars before events and for demolition derbies. Bikes generally run at the Pinjar Park Speedway located north of Perth near the Barbagallo Raceway. The bike track did host rounds of the 2001, 2002 and 2005 Western Australian Solo Championships. Drag Racing The Motorplex drag racing strip is sanctioned by the Australian National Drag Racing Association. Motorvation Motorvation, an annual car show in January, presents \\"supercruises\\" (display-only parades), elite car exhibitions, drag racing challenges, burnout competitions and a \\"Miss Motorvation\\" beauty contest.

About long, the street begins at the north end of I-395 near Oriole Park at Camden Yards and ends near Johns Hopkins University, where it splits. To the right, it becomes Artmuseum Drive, the one-block home of the Baltimore Museum of Art. To the left, it becomes San Martin Drive, which winds road along the western perimeter of the Johns Hopkins University campus and ends at University Parkway. Howard Street is named in honor of former Maryland governor John Eager Howard. Two other streets in Baltimore, John and Eager Streets, are also named after him. At one time, Howard Street was a two-way street throughout its entire route. In 1989, when construction began on the Central Light Rail line, Howard Street was made one-way in a northbound direction between Pratt Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard; as such, southbound traffic now uses Eutaw Street, one block to the west. The light rail runs along Howard Street within this area, which is most of Downtown Baltimore, and near Howard Street for much of the remainder of its route in the downtown area. Retail hub of Baltimore Howard Street around Lexington and Clay Streets was the center of upscale department and specialty store shopping until decline and eventual store closures in the 1970s, with Hutzler's, Stewart's, Hecht's and Hochschild Kohn all located on or facing Howard. Three of the four had side entrances on Lexington Street, which was lined with smaller shops. Lexington connected to Charles Street which was lined with boutiques, jewelers and linen shops nearby O'Neill & Co., a 19th-century carriage trade store, which closed in 1954. Despite much redevelopment in Central Baltimore, these blocks of Howard have been largely abandoned for 40 years or more. Landmarks Notable landmarks on or near Howard Street include: *Baltimore Convention Center *Lexington Market *Maryland Institute College of Art *Maryland State Office Center *Mayfair Theatre at 508 North Howard St. *Meyerhoff Symphony Hall *Oriole Park *University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus Tunnel In the downtown area, a tunnel owned by CSX Transportation runs below Howard Street. This tunnel was first proposed in the 1880s and built in the 1890s as part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Antique Row Antique Row 895 N. Howard Street Antique Row is a cluster of antique shops along the 800 block of North Howard Street in downtown. It dates back to the late 19th century as a cabinetmaking center. In the 1950s Antique Row was at its height, and there were over 50 shops. In the 1960s, the expansion of Maryland General Hospital eliminated those on the west side of the street. Antique Row declined further when the department stores along Howard Street closed, the last one, Hutzler's, in 1989. The construction of the Baltimore Light Rail beginning that same year also slowed down business for the shops for three consecutive years. Once construction was complete, light rail brought more people to Antique Row, although it hasn't regained its former popularity. Antique Row has also had to battle the increased interest in other downtown attractions such as Fells Point and the Inner Harbor. The lack of activity on Howard Street has resulted in an increase in crime and fewer visitors. In turn, the decline in customers is causing shop owners and dealers to move in search of better business; the owners of one long-time shop downsized and moved to a stall. Antique Row is known for its contribution to the community as well as its vast collection of antiques. The neighborhood supports the arts, and became a home to the Eubie Blake National Jazz Institute and Cultural Center at 847 N. Howard Street in 2000. It is hoped that the opening of other art institutions will aid in the revival of Antique Row. Howard Street Bridge The Howard Street Bridge, seen from Interstate 83 thumb One of Howard Street's unique features is the twin steel arch-style bridge that crosses the Jones Falls Expressway, the CSX and Northern Central Railway (and currently the light rail), and Falls Road. Built between 1937-1939 by the J. E. Greiner Company to replace an earlier 19th century iron arch bridge, the bridge begins shortly after the Mt. Royal Avenue underpass, and continues to the intersection at North Avenue. At times, there has been debate over what colors to paint the bridge. Request has been made from citizens to get involved in making the decision. Polling has been used as a method to determine the color the bridge should be painted. On November 17, 2011, Occupy Baltimore protesters marched on the Howard Street Bridge. The bridge was chosen by the protesters because they said it was a symbol of the city's decaying infrastructure and the need to get Americans back to work. Arches During the 1980s, a series of decorative arches were installed along the downtown part of Howard Street in order to add a unique style to the area and its shops. However, when light rail construction began, most of these arches had to be removed because trains would not have been able to pass underneath. Howard Street Tunnel fire On July 18, 2001, a freight train in the tunnel below Howard Street derailed, causing a chemical fire that raged for six days and did damage to Howard Street and the light rail that took several months to repair.

Early life and education Colonel James Harvey McClintock was born in Sacramento, California, February 23, 1864, and is a son of John and Sarah G. (Brittingham) McClintock, of Illinois and Maryland, respectively. The father was a pioneer of California, where, in Sacramento he became a grain shipper and where for many years he was city auditor. James H. McClintock acquired an academic education in his native state, in San Francisco and Berkeley, and later graduated from the Normal School of Arizona at Tempe. In early manhood he engaged in teaching for several terms. Arizona Territory He arrived in Arizona in June; 1879, on one of the first passenger trains into Maricopa. He located in Phoenix, having come to the territory to join his brother, Charles E. McClintock, then engaged in the publication of the Phoenix Herald and soon thereafter took part in the first republican organization known in Phoenix. Since that time he was since been connected with many papers published in the state, in Phoenix, Prescott, Globe, Tempe and Tucson. While residing in Tempe, when but twenty two years of age, he was made justice of the peace and at the same time was engaged in the publication of a paper and in the operation of a farm. For years he was a member of the board of directors of the normal schools of Arizona. McClintock was an employee in the adjutant general's office at Whipple Barracks in 1886‚Äì87 at the time of the Geronimo campaign. For a long period he was the Arizona member of the National Irrigation Congress executive committee, also acting as secretary for the congress. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War In April, 1898, while conducting a news bureau at Phoenix, he assisted Colonel Alexander 0. Brodie and Captain William O. O'Neill in enrolling a cavalry regiment for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Only two troops, two hundred and fifteen men, were accepted. Along with former Assistant Secretary of the US Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, Colonel Brodie had become one of the squadron/battalion commanders of the regiment and was promoted to major, with McClintock as \\"B\\" Troop commander and O'Neill as \\"A\\" Troop commander, these two men were appointed captains in the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, otherwise known as Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Captain McClintock would later be given the brevet of major, for gallantry in action. He was seriously wounded on June 24, 1898, at Guasimas, Cuba, with three machine gun bullets striking him in the leg. B Troop 1st Lieutenant, George B. Wilcox assumed command of the troop and McClintock was evacuated down to the beach at Siboney, and sent back to the United States and transported up to the hospital at Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island. Because of his serious wounds, he did not take part in the more famous Battle of San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898. It would not be until Thanksgiving Day that he was discharged from the hospital at Fort Wadsworth. He was carried on the roles of the Rough Riders until their disbandment. Post-war experience Colonel James McClintock's house was built in 1911 and is located at 323 E. Willetta St. in Phoenix Az. McClintock's discharge from the Rough Riders did not close out his military record, for in June, 1902, he was elected colonel of the First Arizona Infantry. Soon after he commanded the regiment in the most trying labor trouble ever known in the Southwest in a riot of thirty-five hundred miners at Morenci. He handled the situation with firmness, fully protecting the property involved and was gratified that his task was accompanied by no bloodshed. For eight years he was at the head of the regiment and for much of the time acted as adjutant general of Arizona. He served as president of the Rough Riders Association and is its historian. He was also the first commander of the' Spanish War Veterans for the Department of Arizona.

When he became incumbent the income of the office was $28,000 annually. When he surrendered office to a democrat, October 1, 1914, the income had increased to $120,000, showing something of the growth of the city. He had installed six rural routes and had been largely responsible in securing for Phoenix the new federal building, erected at a cost of $170,000. Newspaper and archaeological work Colonel McClintock was also active along other lines. For eighteen years he was the editorial representative in Arizona of the Los Angeles Times and did much magazine writing and special literary work. He took keenest interest in archaeological research, and served as president of the Arizona Folklore Association. In the fall of 1889, he was a member of an expedition sent out by Maricopa county to discover reservoir sites in the mountains of Arizona, the other members being County Surveyor Breckenridge and John R. Norton. They discovered and were the first to plat the site of the Roosevelt dam. Colonel McClintock also for years was a director of the Phoenix Board of Trade and in 1910‚Äì11 was its president.

She specialized in botany in college work and did done much work in the classification of the flora of the Southwest. Mrs. McClintock was one of the founders of the Woman's Club of Phoenix and also of the Arizona Federation of Women's Clubs. Return to California and death McClintock continued to live in Arizona until his poor health forced him to return to Los Angeles, California, where he died on May 10, 1934 at the age of 70. He is buried in the Los Angeles National Cemetery. Legacy Established in 1964, McClintock High School in Tempe bears his name. McClintock Hall at Arizona State University is also named for him.

It was directed by David Hayman.  Plot  Based on a true story. Larry Winters was sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder in a Soho bar in London in 1963. Silent Scream, directed by David Hayman and starring Iain Glen as Winters, is based on the life and writing of Winters. A violent and drug addicted member of the Barlinnie Special Unit in Scotland, Larry died in 1977 of a drug overdose at the age of 34. The film is composed of flashbacks into his younger life as a soldier in the parachute regiment and his childhood in Glasgow and Carbisdale. The memories are triggered by drugs and isolation. Since the film deals primarily with the convict Winters, the viewer experiences his memories to the fullest. His life as a child, in which he is encouraged by his brother to do wrong, is captured in beautiful nostalgia. His life as a young man is beset with problems. The encouragement from his older brother is clearly the cause of his dysfunction. Together the two commit crimes including robbery, breaking and entering, shooting and fighting. His older brother Don (played by Jamie Morton) almost shoots Larry in the head by accident while playing with a World War II rifle stolen previously by Don. The childhood holidays in Carbisdale are fundamental to the biography of Winters. In his own writing he describes the times as his most peaceful. The adventures of the two boys feature heavily in the film. His life in the Parachute regiment is captured with gritty realism. Content with messing about in the military, Winters soon becomes disenchanted with the army, takes part in a brutal beating of another soldier and goes AWOL. Before running off, the viewer witnesses his indecision to take the gun his older brother gave him. The gun which sent him to prison. His own internal battle with right and wrong is what drives the film. It becomes clear that he is gifted but unstable. A writer of poetry, Winters own work gave the film its name. His memories of childhood are frequent but one stands out above the others. The two boys are being attacked by a Glasgow gang and Larry is cornered. His brother Don steps in to save him and gives Larry a glass bottle to fight with. Larry smashes it over the head of his adversary. This represents the beginning of his violence. Later, the two boys break into a mansion house and his brother Don finds a gun and some bullets. They run off and hide in the woods where they begin to play with the weapon. Don loads it and almost shoots Larry in the head. Years later, after several years in prison, Larry has a home visit. Meeting with his older brother (now played by Alexander Morton) and his mother in the family home is one of the most upsetting recurring themes of the film.

The agency developed and now guides implementation of ON TO 2050, a new long-range plan to help the seven counties and 284 communities of northeastern Illinois implement strategies that address transportation, housing, economic development, open space, the environment, and other quality-of-life issues.Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) website. History In the summer of 2005, Public Act 094-0510 called for the creation of a new Regional Planning Board to merge operations of the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) and the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC).Chicago Tribune, \\"Seven-county planning board launches,\\" October 21, 2005. For 50 years, CATS had been responsible for regional transportation planning as the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Chicago region, and over the same period, NIPC was responsible for regional land-use planning. In 2006, the new organization was named the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and submitted a legislatively mandated strategic report to the Governor and General Assembly. Development of the comprehensive regional plan began in September 2007, with development of a regional vision. It continued through two years of research that culminated in 2009 with extensive public outreach that coincided with the centennial of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The resulting \\"preferred regional scenario\\" published in January 2010 preceded release of the draft plan for comment in May 2010. And the final GO TO 2040 plan was adopted unanimously by leaders from across the seven counties on October 13, 2010, at which point the agency's efforts shifted to implementation of the plan.GO TO 2040 process archive.Media coverage of GO TO 2040 adoption, October 2013.

CMAP has committees at the policy, advisory, coordinating, and working levels that play integral roles in the agency's planning processes.CMAP committees pages. The State of Illinois legislation that created CMAP gave the agency the task of integrating the previously separate topics of land use and transportation into one agency that would protect natural resources, improve mobility, and minimize traffic congestion in the seven-county region. Under federal MAP-21 legislation, CMAP is responsible for developing the region's official transportation plan, part of the broader ON TO 2050 comprehensive plan that integrates transportation with land use, housing, economic development, open space, the environment, and other quality- of-life issues. This transportation plan must be updated every four years, use visualization techniques, engage the general public, and include a separate Transportation Improvement Program document. Its annual work plan and budget document describe the current fiscal year's projects, and the previous year's are described in an annual report. On October 14, 2010, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Sustainable Communities Initiative announced a three-year, $4.25 million award to CMAP for technical assistance to communities seeking to implement GO TO 2040. The grant led CMAP to create a Local Technical Assistance (LTA) program that helps communities across the Chicago metropolitan region to undertake planning projects that advance principles of the comprehensive regional plan. ON TO 2050 Comprehensive Regional Plan CMAP and its partners developed and are now implementing the ON TO 2050 comprehensive regional plan, which was adopted on October 10, 2018. The launch of the plan's development was featured by WTTW television in the February 23, 2016 edition of Chicago Tonight. During April-August 2017, CMAP engaged residents and stakeholder groups who were invited to comment on five \\"Alternative Futures.\\" The public can also provide feedback about ON TO 2050 topics being studied for Strategy Papers and Snapshot Reports currently in development.

Most notable was the return to service of the original steam locomotive No. 1 \\"Sutherland\\" which hauled special services all year, including excursions on the Manx Electric Railway; other highlights included night trains, arranged photography sessions, slide and film shows, unusual tram trips, and visiting locomotives on the Groudle Glen Railway and many more.

Although there are still annual events periods on the island these are now a very half-hearted affair and do not bring the enthusiasts as they once did. Events Following the successful pattern established with 1993's Year Of Railways the biggest draw of the events periods centered on the return to service of the railway's first locomotive dating from 1873 and this was commemorated by a public re-commissioning followed by a special train to Port Erin. Included in the array of varied events elsewhere on the island's railway network were:- * Use of a low loader to transfer No. 1 \\"Sutherland\\" to Laxey where it ran a service on the Manx Electric Railway between Laxey and Fairy Cottage * Illuminated tram redecorated to proclaim \\"Steam 125\\"; it ran shuttles to Groudle where the Groudle Glen Railway put on evening services * Photo trams and trains ran which would stop at preselected scenic locations so that the passengers could alight, photograph and proceed to the next location * Visiting locomotive \\"Jack\\" on the Groudle Glen Railway as well as additional evening and weekend services on that line in events periods * Chasing buses that shadowed special services to viewpoints and chased ahead to await the arrival of trains/trams, sometimes utilising vintage buses * Special tram services were featured that included running commentaries about the views and attractions along the length of the routes with stopping places * Parallel- running of a variety of electric tramcars which this usually took place prior to daily services to facilitate use of both running lines * Floodlit evening photography and barbecues were held with staff creating shunting movements for the benefit of spectators, often with little-used rolling stock * Guided tours around sheds and depots which would normally be closed to members of the public, both in the day and in conjunction with evening sessions *Guided walks of the closed railway lines to Peel, Ramsey and Foxdale with connecting vintage buses and coaches between venues, and refreshments *Slide and film shows with a \\"bring your own along\\" policy ensuring a varied mix of entertainments, also including raffles and other attractions *The return of steam to Peel in the form of No. 1 \\"Sutherland\\" running on a small section of track in what had previously been Peel Station *Cavalcade line-ups of the horse tram fleet outside the workshops at Derby Castle, including some rarely used tramcars in service along the promenade This series of special events on the island's railways proved to be the last significant period of events held, with the galas gradually becoming less significant and held over a shorter period of time, as management policies changed into the new millennium.
